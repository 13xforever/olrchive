Warhammer overcharges customers in Arrow

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 362 of Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
For a moment it sounded like you were using a porn voice

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A porn voice?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, a porn voice

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What was porn-tastic about my voice?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You were doing that little dip in your voice

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was doing that wacky morning DJ

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's go to Techmaster Loki with a check on traffic

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No traffic in the house

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, let's go to Techmaster Loki with a check on the food

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What's the food look like in the OLR studio today?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Awful and in a bag

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, for those who weren't listening to the wonderful Bobby Blackwolf

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
who tapes before us here at All Games Radio

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
www.allgames.com where of course we tape live every week

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
6pm Pacific, etc.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We were doing our little call that Bobby always does to us at the end of the show

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and we got the realization that Loki brought to the show with him tonight

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
KFC, but he usually brings chicken to the show

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that's no surprise

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
but he didn't just bring any old KFC tonight

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
oh no, he brought a Double Down to the show with him

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
For those who don't know what a Double Down is

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Loki, please quickly define

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What is the Double Down from KFC?

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a new sandwich from KFC that just launched today I think

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and it's basically instead of having some sort of bread holding a sandwich together

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
there is chicken strips holding bacon, cheese, and cheese sauce together

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and it's supposed to be incredibly unhealthy

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
so that's why I tried it

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
because it would be funny

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
because it's like, oh my god, that's gross

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
yes, when you have that heart attack, it's gonna be hilarious

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it smelled awful

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
it actually wasn't bad, but here's the problem

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the cheese sauce is just awful

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that's why I am not eating that

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
not because it's so unhealthy and full of bacon and grease and stuff like that

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
it's because that cheese sauce tastes like some blended

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
rotten mayonnaise, ranch, and cheese whiz together

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and it's just, it's awful

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
so, if you do get Double Down, don't get it with the cheese sauce

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
otherwise it'll probably be good without it

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I mean, seriously, the strips themselves

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
it's all white meat and so it's healthy for you

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
no, just kidding, it's not healthy

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you can get it grilled though

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
that's gonna really help with all the cheese on it

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I think though that if you got it grilled

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
well, it actually would be perfect for anyone doing a low carb diet though

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I guess, but honestly, if I want to eat healthy, quote unquote, at KFC

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I would probably get like a two piece meal

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
grilled with like mashed potatoes, no gravy, or something

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know, I was just being funny

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
or I probably wouldn't go to KFC at all

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I would probably just eat a fruit salad

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I just was going to see if they had the Double Down

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
they did, so I got it, and

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I was sorely disappointed with that cheese sauce

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I figured, okay, it's just gonna be something that tastes like cheese

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but it's like a melted consistency

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but no, they had to spice it up with like ranch or something

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
it's just gross, and it's overpowering the entire

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
it smelled really bad, or whatever it is

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I could smell it from over here

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
so that's so unfortunate because I had high hopes for that

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
but, oh well

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I actually have a challenge for everybody

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
for next month

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
what's that?

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
no fast food for a month

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
good luck

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've been

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
no, I've done it before

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that wasn't the first fast food I've had in two weeks, so

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
it's not dinner that I have a problem with

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that's really easy, it's lunch at work

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
is really hard, especially when I only have had a three minute lunch

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but I'm starting a new job this coming week

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
which is exciting

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I will tell you

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
day job

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
my BFF Becky

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
we have three days out of the week

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
we walk during lunch, and we bring our own lunch

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and I have this huge mungus thermos thing

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
but the dollar store, Rob, is selling those cubes

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
those frozen cube things

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
that you can put in a thermal container

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
but no, it was something I was actually wanting to do

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
is do the one month fast food free challenge

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and then

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
for, you know, average how many times you want

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
would normally go out for fast food

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and then put the money that you normally would have spent

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
on a happy meal or something aside

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and donate it to charity at the end of the month

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
questions from chat

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Zappi says, does Subway count as fast food?

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, what defines fast food?

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's tricky

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
because you can't say anything without a drive-thru

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
because I've seen subways with drive-thrus

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and subways with drive-thrus?

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
God, that would be annoying

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay, I'll make a list

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Basically, okay, if it's a sandwich

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you know, if it looks unhealthy, it probably is fast food

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I would say the types like McDonald's and Sonic

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I love Sonic

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's something like, we're getting way off topic

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If they serve hamburgers or tacos

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Or maybe if fast food is okay

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
if you can keep it 10 grams of fat or less

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Because at Subway it's really easy to do 10 grams of fat or less

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, this is the thing

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Almost any of these

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm talking about just like the

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the really highly processed food, you know what I mean?

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I include KFC in this too

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
because their chicken is just a gene bait

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But seriously

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm giving it a start in May

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
because I know for a lot of people it's a habit to change

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's try to tie it in with some type of Wii Fit or DDR

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's what I was thinking

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If you rub the food on a piece of paper

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and it turns transparent

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
then it's probably fast food

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The food or the paper

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We gotta get back to

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Listeners, help give us ideas

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and we'll formulate a contest

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But seriously though, this is the first soda

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and first fast food I've had in two weeks

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I ate my first soda today

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's only because I wanted to try to double down

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So technically I ate very few calories

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
because I only had like two bites of that in a soda

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So I'm doing good still

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So what grade would you give the KFC double down here?

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I would give it probably a D

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
just because the cheese sauce

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If it was at the cheese sauce

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I would have probably given it like a B

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The double down gets a D here on Orange Lounge Mornings

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
on KAllGames

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It needs like American cheese melted on there

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
instead of the cheese sauce and it might be good

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Once in a while we talk about video games here on the program at Orange Lounge Radio

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hey if you wanna pull up a chair and join us in our chatroom

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Or what they need to have instead of the cheese sauce

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
their gravy that they have

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That would be perfect

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay enough, enough, no more food talk

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's talk about games, dark sakura

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Please tell me you've played a video game this week

171
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Rock band

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
A fuck ton of rock band last night for my party

173
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What was the best beer at your beer potluck out of curiosity?

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What was the best one?

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The one that I brought of course

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm just kidding

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You know what Rob, I've actually saved that chocolate beer for an occasion

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And Dan's like, they bring you, what's this? Peach? What?

179
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's good

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I like the black currant one but I've had tons of their different ones before

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I haven't tried the peach yet but I love the black currant

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But the Young's is gonna be

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm going to be having one every night when I get back from school

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Nice

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's gonna be my I'm not in school beer

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There's still so much beer in my fridge really

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I wasn't really gonna drink any

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's totally my fault but we went from food to beer

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And just totally dodged the game

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh yeah, by the way, rock band, beer!

191
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Totally my fault, I enabled it

192
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I had a Guinness, a couple of new castles, about three fat tires

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Clearly she was playing tapper

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Two Killian's Red

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Heather brought the Sierra Nevada but I really don't like Sierra Nevada at all

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And then I was gonna go, I actually picked up the four pack

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I was like, I'm gonna have, can't drink any more beer!

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I had no voice, my throat still hurts today

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And there was rock band?

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There was lots of rock band, all day, rock band

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We stopped long enough for Dan to play outrun

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And then him and one of my co-workers that showed up

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Played, it was either him, no I think it was my friend Gary anyway

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They were playing Bad Dudes

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Awesome, oh like on the Wii?

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No the Xbox, was it Bad Dudes or Double Dragon?

207
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's Double Dragon, it's on the Xbox, not Bad Dudes

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I was like, are you a bad enough dude to eat some carrot cake?

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Just the topic of Bad Dudes has come up on this show before

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There is still a lot of cake left

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If anybody wants cake, I have lots

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Will you FedEx slices of cake to our listeners?

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm talking about people in this house

214
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What kind of cake?

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Chocolate and carrot

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The carrot cake is actually really good

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Chocolate and carrot cake or chocolate and carrot cake?

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Separate

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh the chocolate and carrot cake would be kind of rad

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You could smoosh it together

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't like carrot cake

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
God damn it with the food!

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Would you like a piece of chocolate?

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No, I shouldn't, so I'm not going to

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You should have some chocolate cake

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Take it with you

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Take it with you

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't take it with me, Laura

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I could build a house out of cake

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That sounds like a fun project

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Should I just pitch the show for the Food Network?

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I mean, should we leave all games and be on a more appropriate network?

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No, I have tons of game stuff I could talk about

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm just waiting

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Add three cakes

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
One of them is gluten free though, so I will be taking some to work

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So cake mania, taproom

238
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm going to get cake right now

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Loki

240
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Here I thought this week's show would be better than the train wreck that was last week

241
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But clearly, clearly I was underestimating the ability of this program

242
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, Loki, before you do your gaming week

243
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I already spoiled it and sent it to the listeners last week

244
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But congratulations for you and Nellie are in order

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes, thank you, thank you

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She is, ironically enough today

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
She is as pregnant as she was when she had the twins

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So she is a little nervous, but less nervous today

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But yes, she's about 21 weeks and four days, I believe?

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Three days? 21 weeks and three days

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, so

252
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
One boy, we know that

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So everything's cool so far

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Anyways, so games

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So let me first start off with a story

256
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Because this is really odd, but awesome at the same time

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So Friday, you know, it

258
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I think it was Friday, anyways

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Friday, not this Friday, but last Friday

260
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I get this mysterious package in the mail

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm like, what the hell is this?

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Was it something I ordered off eBay and completely forgot about?

263
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Inside was an Xbox 360

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Apparently we have a listener who is staying anonymous

265
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
In the Austin, Texas area

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And has sent me a 360 that was already J-tagged

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
To replace the 360 that I had stolen

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know who we have in Austin, Texas

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know either

270
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's not far from where Travis Donovan is, but

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He doesn't really like this show

272
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, no, I don't know

273
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Whoever it was, they posted like a small little message

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was kind of in broken English, so I don't know if it's

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know, anyways

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So long story short, I'm very thankful for that

277
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And thankfully I do have

278
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Wait, how did they get your address?

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't know

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Isn't that, doesn't that, wait, wait

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Doesn't that strike you as slightly creepy?

282
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Like, I don't know if I would actually be excited about the Xbox

283
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I would more be wondering, how did a listener get my home address?

284
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No, it was sent to my work, so

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, have you said where you work on this program before?

286
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I might have at one point

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Weird

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Maybe Namco sent it, they know where you work

289
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes, that makes perfect sense

290
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We learned that a couple of years ago

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Fun times

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No, but anyways, I'm incredibly thankful for that

293
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And, you know, I've been messing with it for

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Well, this last, you know, week or so

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay, but seriously, ask before you send us strange packages in the mail

296
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's always a nice thing to do

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Exactly, and I mean, definitely, I would

298
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You know, that was incredible, and I

299
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, I mean, it's a very nice gesture

300
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Exactly

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There is a small part of me where I'm like, oh, that's awesome

302
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Like, that's 90%, no, I was even like 95% awesome

303
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But 5%, like, how did they get your address?

304
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I wasn't even thinking about that, honestly

305
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was like, woohoo, yeah!

306
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No, but, no, it's been cool

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So, I've been playing a lot of games, obviously

308
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
One more thought, could it have been the guy that we sicced the O.L. Army on?

309
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Maybe just

310
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
In Austin, Texas? Would he, like, leave the state?

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Maybe?

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know

313
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Alright, just cheers

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Alright

315
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So anyways, so, games

316
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What did I play this week?

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I played, actually, some Japanese shooters

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was at Espegluda 2, actually played that quite a bit

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Went through kind of the

320
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I figured I'd start off at the easy mode on there

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And it's pretty fun, it's a little different

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I haven't really played a lot of the Japanese shmup games

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But, it's pretty fun, a lot of dodging bullets and whatnot

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So, definitely worth checking out if they ever bring it over here

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Tried a little bit of Otomedius Gorgeous

326
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That game is a little weirder than I thought

327
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But it definitely has that whole Gradius vibe to it, of course

328
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But that's pretty fun

329
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And, played through more Final Fantasy XIII

330
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm now, well, I don't know if I should say Warmack

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Because that's kind of a spoiler, I guess

332
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But, I'm to the point in the game where it kind of opens up, like, you know

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
How many hours in are you?

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
16, but then again I'm cheating, remember, so

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, right, that's right

336
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So, I'm on chapter 11, I believe

337
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Okay, okay

338
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And it opens up kind of like an overworld and stuff

339
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And it's almost like in Wind Waker where you go, spoiler

340
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You go under the ocean or whatever and you see Hyrule

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And you're like, why couldn't the whole game have been like this, you know?

342
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Why couldn't they have just done this instead?

343
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, that's almost, to me, what this part of the game is for Final Fantasy XIII

344
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
For the people that are complaining, why isn't there an overworld in this?

345
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You know, why couldn't they have done the whole game like this?

346
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Because it's basically kind of like an overworld situation

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But, at the same time there's all these side quests and stuff you can do

348
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Which are kind of annoying, but they're relatively easy for me, I guess

349
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And the narrative's kind of moving along a little bit, but I still don't know entirely what's going on

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But I think I'm at the end, or close to the end

351
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I just want to interject real quick, because the chatters were commenting on Loki's mic being all screwed up tonight

352
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's actually really my bad

353
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I took Loki's mic to PAX East with me for the show that we did out there

354
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And unfortunately he has our old spare mic, which is just an old mic we had lying around

355
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And the audio settings were left on, every mic is different

356
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And so, long story short, I've been having to adjust on the fly

357
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So if Loki's audio is going up and down and changing around, that's me playing on the mixing board

358
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So it should be all better now though, I think I found where it needs to be

359
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Sorry, listeners, sorry, Loki

360
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And then, so yeah, it's alright, it's kind of neat

361
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And unfortunately those characters didn't seem like they were too much lesbians at this point in the game

362
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Although there was an embrace part of the game which I was like, are they gonna kiss?

363
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I wasn't trying to go there, I was trying to keep quiet on the spoilery stuff

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But I do think there are lesbians in Final Fantasy 13

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah, they're close, we don't know how close, but they're close

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I think they're very close, just saying

367
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Cougar kitten thing going on there

368
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There is definitely a cougar kitten thing going on

369
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Anyway, no more spoilers

370
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Alright, anyways, so yeah, it's pretty awesome

371
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And then, and there's a loud commercial for Lysol power toilet cleaner

372
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Anyways, I believe that was it as far as games though

373
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Granted, you probably guys know what JTAG consoles are for

374
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Nothing legit, Bobby would not approve, of course

375
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let me just say, there's a lot of Rock Band load content out there

376
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Well, I'm hoping, Loki, you're only using it to do the import games and not the shady stuff

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Import games are okay, I think

378
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I say import games, they don't bother to release, they're a fair game

379
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's my stance on piracy

380
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The only games I've ever really, really liked, just totally been hardcore pirating into would be the import stuff

381
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Especially back in the PS1 days

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Because I'm not gonna pay to import games if the publisher doesn't believe in the game here

383
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I did install a 640GB hard drive though in the shell of an old 360 case

384
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So now I can use that because JTAG consoles allow you to do that

385
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But it's awesome, I like playing games from other regions

386
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Alright, if that's it for your gaming week, then I'll talk quickly about my gaming week

387
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I actually didn't play a lot of new games, just kind of a potpourri, a lot, a lot of old games this week

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Especially on Xbox Live Arcade

389
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I did play a little more Game Room, I guess I could say that, just a little more

390
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I haven't really been working on the Yars Revenge duel with Bobby

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Because actually, Bradley, Arkadian42, who hasn't been on this show in quite some time

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But he was here last night

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I randomly saw him yesterday, yes, he has smoked both Bobby and I

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't think Bobby can see that

395
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But like, now I don't just have to beat Bobby, I have to beat Bradley

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And that's even, that's 130,000 points

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I actually messed a little bit with Game Room

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I noticed I got a lot of achievements really quick by just doing stuff

399
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You can get about 100 points doing next to nothing

400
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But you do have to actually play games to get more

401
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But I bought Crystal Castles

402
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Because I had a friend over who really wanted to see Crystal

403
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Because they remembered it from the 80s and they really wanted to play it

404
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And I was like, okay, you know, I liked Crystal Castles enough

405
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Where I'll spend the money to get it

406
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You know, it's like renting a movie

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You know, five bucks is about how much it costs to rent a movie

408
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because I buy all my games for both, computer and 360

409
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And when we got it, I realized the control sucks

410
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Like really sucks for that game

411
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Because the controller analog stick is no substitute for a trackball

412
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Not at all

413
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Tried to play it and then I thought, oh, it'll be okay

414
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Because I have it on the computer

415
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And I can use the mouse

416
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And the mouse makes a, because a mouse is basically an inverted trackball

417
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So it makes a, it's not a perfect substitute

418
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But it's probably the best one there is

419
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So I figured, okay, I'll play Crystal Castles with the mouse

420
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Nope, can't use the mouse

421
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I remember I, irritating

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I used to play that on the Apple II

423
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Way back in the day

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And a mouse worked okay then

425
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I guess if they don't support it at all then

426
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't support it at all

427
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's awful

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Unless, I could have missed something

429
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But, you know, what I did is I unplugged my 360 controller

430
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And it defaulted to keyboard controls

431
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And I couldn't find an option in there to switch it to the mouse to control

432
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Which makes sense because you don't have a mouse on 360

433
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And the game is kind of made for both

434
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And it's very obvious

435
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But it's just, you know, it's just these little things

436
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That are just killing Game Room for me

437
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Like there's so much potential with Game Room

438
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And there's so much that I really want to like about Game Room

439
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But there's these glaring things that just irritate me

440
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Like, oh, why didn't you find this sooner you dummy

441
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You know, just in the servers

442
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And, you know, just some of the things with it

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Um, let's see, look at our chat room

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
chat.orangelandrater.com

445
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Brad says, sucks, does not even begin to describe it

446
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad there

447
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Ah, alright, anyhow

448
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Um, chat.orangelandrater.com

449
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
If you want to join us

450
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So, yeah, a little bit of Game Room

451
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And just some random other games too

452
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
On the arcade, you know, like playing

453
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Street Fighter and Puzzle Fighter

454
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And Mega Man 9 and just random stuff

455
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
All throughout the week

456
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And wow, lots of wow

457
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I rolled a Death Knight

458
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
My Death Knight's already level, just about level 61

459
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
PVP is super fun with a Death Knight

460
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I just want to say

461
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's a lot of fun

462
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So, alright, um, let's get into some housekeeping tonight

463
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Of which I don't have an awful lot

464
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Um, just, you know, uh, join our Facebook

465
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If you haven't already

466
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

467
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You can also follow us on Twitter

468
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
At Twitter.com slash O-L-R

And definitely try to join us for a live show sometime

470
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock

471
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's a much different experience when you listen live

472
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
6 o'clock Pacific, of course, 9 o'clock Eastern

473
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at AllGames.com

474
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's really all I have for housekeeping

475
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We don't have any shows off that I'm aware of coming up

476
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Or anything else

477
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So, we're just gonna keep right on truckin'

478
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
With some gaming news

479
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Quite a bit of gaming news coming out of Konami

480
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
They had a big press

481
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
They had their, um, uh, Gamers' Night this week, right?

482
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Really, I didn't know

483
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We didn't get invited

484
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Well, you know, but it's in L.A. now

485
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I wouldn't have been able to go anyway if we did

486
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh, that's true, that's right

487
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You know, and

488
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I always forget that they're not

489
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, they're not in the Bay anymore

490
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So, yeah, I wouldn't have been able to go anyway

491
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't know

492
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's kind of one of those things where, especially if they're

493
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You know, one thing we don't have news on is, is DDR

494
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And, you know, I realize that's kind of how we started

495
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Although, I guess

496
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't know if I should say this, but

497
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't know if I really should say this on the air

498
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
There's a very good chance we're gonna have an interview with them at E3 this year

499
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Very good chance

500
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm trying to pull some strings

501
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So, uh, gonna be a, gonna be a fun E3

502
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Alright

503
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You're going to E3?

504
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yep

505
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Alright, cool

506
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Good times

507
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Alright, anyhow, sorry

508
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You already could tell some news from, uh

509
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I thought you, are you, well, you can't go

510
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Now, I wondered why you were so, like, nope, can't go

511
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Nope, there's no way I'm going to E3 this year

512
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And I was like, well, what, you're not even gonna ask? What the hell?

513
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And now that we know that the wife is pregnant

514
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Now, that makes sense

515
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Cause isn't that right around the due date too?

516
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
No, August

517
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh no, okay

518
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So

519
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Well, you said a long time ago, Jamie, you couldn't go

520
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You said school or something

521
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm trying to graduate

522
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah

523
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So

524
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'll go

525
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I suppose if no one else wants to go, I'll go to E3

526
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And, you know, do whatever

527
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Alright, anyhow

528
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Konami, news

529
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, I forgot to ask you

530
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
What?

531
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Because you went to PAX East, did they have any of the PlayStation Move stuff there?

532
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Did you get the, hm, would you play it?

533
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
No, there was no move at PAX East

534
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah, they sucked

535
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Well, you'll have to listen to last week's show, no, I'm kidding

536
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't want to listen to last week's show

537
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, it was pretty bad

538
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Uh, hey, this week isn't turning out much better

539
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Uh, APB was there

540
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I think that's the one you would have liked the most

541
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah, they had a playable, they had playable ABP

542
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I definitely thought of you

543
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I do have video I shot, I can show you at some point

544
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Awesome

545
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That was the one that, well, actually, you would have really enjoyed the line

546
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The Crackdown 2 was out on the floor

547
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yep

548
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And, uh, I don't know what else you really liked

549
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But it just seemed there was a lot of Loki games there

550
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, I wanted to check out Crackdown 2

551
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But I'll wait for that

552
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm actually going back to Crackdown 1 to try to finish, finish that

553
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I mean, I finished it, but I have to find, like, ten orbs that I'm missing

554
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Um, and, just, I'm trying to go back to some of the older stuff

555
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But, really, I don't know, Crackdown 2 is going to be awesome

556
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm so sad that they pushed it to July

557
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's supposed to be coming out in May

558
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Alright, oh well

559
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Anyway, we had Konami news at some point, right?

560
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes

561
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Alright

562
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So let's talk about Konami

563
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Uh, Konami is taking a page out of Capcom's book

564
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Um, re-issuing one of their games and kind of giving it the whole HD treatment

565
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Uh, Russian Attack Ex-Patriot is a brand new Russian Attack game

566
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Kind of looks very similar to Bionic Commando Rearmed

567
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And they're doing the whole 2.5D, um, kind of update to it

568
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And it will be available on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network

569
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And, of course, um, the game looks pretty cool

570
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Except, honestly, I don't believe I liked Russian Attack very much

571
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Maybe just because it was very difficult

572
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It can't be a souped up version of the old arcade game

573
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The old arcade game was too straightforward

574
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Like, it was a very old school 80s game

575
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, this is supposed to be pretty linear too, I think

576
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Interesting

577
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Well, you know, the little video I saw

578
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's ironic that you compare it to Capcom and Bionic Commando

579
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Because that's the first thing I thought of

580
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And the look of it

581
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Just the color palette and stuff reminds me

582
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Just the look of it really looks like Bionic Commando Rearmed

583
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But, sort of, to be fair, it looked a little bit like Shadow Complex as well

584
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Shadow Complex kind of has that same sort of style to it

585
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's not bad

586
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
With the 2D, 3D look

587
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh, yeah, it looked cool

588
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The Russian Attack arcade game's okay

589
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But here's the thing

590
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Bionic Commando Rearmed, I think, really cashed in

591
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I don't know why we keep comparing it to this

592
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But it's just why, what I think when I see it

593
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Because they did it well

594
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
They were the best example of doing this

595
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yes, and, but Bionic Commando had a lot of nostalgia with it

596
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Like, I think more people remember Bionic Commando

597
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Than remember Russian Attack

598
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Like, quick poll of our chat room

599
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
How many of you remember Russian Attack?

600
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Like, not just, like, name, triggers

601
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Oh, yeah, I think that was a game somewhere

602
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But, like, actually, like, can think of in your mind

603
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
How the game plays

604
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Like, just, you know

605
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Especially versus Bionic Commando

606
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Just a quick poll of chat

607
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Chirp, chirp

608
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Do you remember Russian Attack, Jamie?

609
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I remember looking at it

610
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And she's got a freaking vault of games

611
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't think we have Russian Attack

612
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
She has a freaking game that came with a dish

613
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I mean, that's

614
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That's true, I do have a game that came with a dish

615
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And she doesn't remember Russian Attack very well

616
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I mean, that ought to tell you something right there

617
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So

618
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And Dan's not here for us to

619
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
No, Zappy, not Russian

620
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's Rush in Attack

621
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh, yeah, I do remember that

622
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Rush and Attack

623
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes, but with an N

624
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No, wasn't there an arcade one?

625
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yes

626
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yeah, we had it at my arcade

627
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay, oh, well, there you go

628
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
No, there was another game, though, that was

629
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I was thinking, never mind

630
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah, we had it at my arcade

631
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Zappy in our chat room

632
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Russian Attack would be like Karnov

633
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That's Russian Attack

634
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It had that kind of oblique, all bold logo to it as well

635
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah

636
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah, I remember it

637
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says

638
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Rush in Attack was a game I fondly remember

639
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I remember going to a local grocery store

640
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And putting a ton of quarters trying to beat the game

641
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It was hard, but then when I had fun playing it on the NES

642
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw also jumps in that

643
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Russian Attack on the NES had two player co-op

644
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I mean, Satsuma said

645
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I remember playing an XBLA demo of Russian Attack

646
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Does that count?

647
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And yeah, that was one of those Konami games

648
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
They dumped a bunch of them on Xbox Live

649
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
When the arcade was first out

650
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They were like a dime a dozen

651
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I mean, some of them were notable

652
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You know Frogger, the old arcade game

653
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It was one of the first ones, so it was still pretty cool

654
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
JIRUS, like I really like that one

655
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Time Pilot, and there was a lot of obscure

656
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Scramble

657
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
They need a 2.5D HD remake of Contra

658
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
They had a Contra on it

659
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But it was just the arcade version

660
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Well, yeah, but they had a sequel they did for WiiWare

661
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I mean, port that over

662
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'll tell you one title, Konami

663
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That will not work with this HD remix thing

664
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And I think you've already done it anyways

665
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Frogger, please god, no more Frogger games

666
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Ever, no more

667
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm pretty sure it's already been done

668
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
There was a Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade

669
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But the funny thing about it

670
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's actually like the third or fourth Frogger 2

671
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's come out

672
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Cause like back in the Commodore 64 days

673
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
There was Frogger 2 three deep

674
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
There was Frogger 2 on the Playstation

675
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And then there was this Frogger Swampies thing

676
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't know, whatever

677
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Ooh, Dark Tetsuya has a good point

678
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It used to be called Green Beret in Japan

679
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
If I recall correctly, I think he's right

680
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I think that game was called something completely different overseas

681
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I think it was called Green Beret, that's right

682
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I remember the game on Xbox Live

683
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But like before that, not really

684
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You know, so again

685
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I just, you know

686
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
If the nostalgia is what they're trying to cash in on

687
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I don't think there's a lot of nostalgia there

688
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So I sort of hope the game can stand on its own two feet

689
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I mean, the game can rise above the nostalgia

690
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
If it's a great game, it won't matter

691
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That it ties into this obscure ass 80s game nobody remembers, right?

692
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Exactly

693
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So we'll see, I guess

694
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I imagine there'll be more of this

695
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
At E3?

696
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Probably

697
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Robert M says, Rush and Attack was on the Game Boy Advance compilation, wasn't it?

698
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I am like 95% positive, yes it was

699
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It was on that Game Boy Advance compilation

700
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That had all the old school Konami games from the 80s

701
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I don't know if they called it that

702
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It might have been on its other name, I don't know

703
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Anyhow, lots of games were announced at the Konami event

704
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
One of them is Saw 2

705
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That's right, Saw 2

706
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Is going to be coming out

707
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It's being developed by Zombie Studios

708
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
They did the first game as well

709
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's coming out for Halloween

710
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Just in time for the movie

711
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I think they have said that they will keep making those damn movies

712
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Until they stop making money

713
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Considering those movies cost less than 10 million dollars to make

714
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You're gonna have a lot of Saw movies, guys

715
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Unfortunately

716
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I gotta admit though

717
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm kind of surprised that a Saw sequel is happening

718
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Because I didn't think the first game did very well

719
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I could be wrong

720
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It didn't do that well, I don't think

721
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Honestly, having seen all the Saw movies

722
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The last one was alright

723
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I kind of liked it

724
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But

725
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's getting to the point

726
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The game or the movie?

727
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The movie

728
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The games have nothing to do with the movies

729
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
They don't follow the plots of the movies

730
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
They try to do their own thing

731
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Sort of

732
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But I'm just saying

733
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
They basically killed off

734
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Jigsaw in the second movie

735
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The third movie

736
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Maybe the second movie

737
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I can't remember which one

738
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I think it was the second one

739
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It kind of makes it difficult

740
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
To

741
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Keep having this guy do it

742
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Because now you have someone else

743
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Taking over for him

744
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It's just getting ridiculous now

745
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Um

746
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You know what?

747
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
According to VGcharts.com

748
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Again, take this with a grain of salt

749
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Because I don't know how accurate these numbers are

750
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But according to VGcharts.com

751
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Saw pushed.21 million

752
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
On the Xbox 360

753
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That's 200,000

754
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And then.23 million on Playstation 3

755
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So it actually sold better on Playstation 3

756
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And so that would be a combined half million

757
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So

758
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Not bad

759
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But they only sold that I think right at launch

760
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I don't think that they really

761
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It was a title that kind of

762
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Made its money the first

763
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Two months and then just

764
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Nothing

765
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And I should say that is worldwide

766
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Because actually the game did much better overseas

767
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Than it did in the Americas

768
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Which is kind of interesting

769
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh and that explains why the PS3

770
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Sold more

771
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Actually the Xbox 360 sold more in America

772
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And only 100,000 on PS3

773
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Don't get me wrong it was an alright game

774
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Again take those sales figures with a grain of salt

775
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah and I think the game was alright

776
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It was kind of repetitive I guess

777
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And you know

778
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The new game though

779
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Apparently is going to have some better puzzles in it

780
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
They were talking about one that was

781
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Being shown off as a demo

782
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And apparently no one figured it out

783
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Unless they were told how to do it

784
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So I don't know if that's good or not

785
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But it's interesting

786
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
They're saying of course more

787
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yucky gross death machines

788
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Which is the whole thing that kind of turns me off

789
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Of the Saw series and I will admit

790
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's weird like I have no problem with

791
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Konami's other franchise

792
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Silent Hill but it's

793
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I have no problem with the gore in that game

794
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But it's Saw bugs me

795
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I can't explain it and maybe it's because

796
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Saw is a bit too real

797
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Whereas like Silent Hill

798
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Obviously Pyramid Head is not real

799
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's supernatural

800
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's a little more supernatural

801
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I can't explain what the difference is

802
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Saw just

803
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I don't know

804
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I've talked about this on the show before

805
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's just torture porn to me

806
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It doesn't excite me

807
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I get that there's people into it

808
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But I'm just not one of them

809
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Whatever they're making a new game

810
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I guess the first one didn't sell as bad as we all think it did

811
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If those numbers are any indication

812
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't think a half million combined worldwide is terrible

813
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Certainly there's games that do a hell of a lot worse

814
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But I don't think it was a launch of a franchise

815
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
As they had hoped

816
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They were hoping that this was going to be their next Silent Hill franchise

817
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And

818
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I think Silent Hill does a lot better

819
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Interesting

820
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Well Dark Sakura

821
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
What?

822
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You have some more news for us out of Konami

823
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yes I do

824
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But I'm still kind of

825
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
About it

826
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
There is another Silent Hill game

827
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
In the works for PS3 and Xbox 360

828
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But they didn't really give out any other information about that

829
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Just said that it's another one

830
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm surprised by this news

831
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I assumed that Silent Hill was done

832
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Because I assumed that Homecoming did not perform well enough

833
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It didn't

834
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But I mean

835
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Shattered Memories did okay

836
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But I actually returned my copy

837
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Wasn't the rumor that what they were showing

838
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Like a Shattered Memories type of game

839
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Not necessarily like Homecoming

840
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I thought I heard something

841
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The rumor is it's supposed to be like a

842
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Like what Shattered Memories was to Silent Hill 1

843
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
This is supposed to be to Silent Hill 2 or something

844
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I don't want that

845
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't want to play that

846
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I didn't really enjoy that much of Shattered Memories

847
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Weird

848
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I just like

849
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Plain old good Silent Hill

850
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Last decent one was 4

851
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And that's it

852
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Silent Hill Shattered Memories on the Wii

853
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
.18 million

854
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So that's less than

855
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And again these numbers are coming from vgcharts.com

856
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That's much less than what Saw moved

857
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
How did Homecoming do?

858
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The problem is

859
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Homecoming moved.36 million

860
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That's on the 360

861
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:36,880
And how much on PS

862
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Whatever the reason

863
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
You can put out really awesome mature games on it

864
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
But no one's buying them

865
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Well the other thing that strikes me odd

866
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,880
About the fact that they're continuing the Silent Hill franchise

867
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
I mean even if the Silent Hill Wii game

868
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Was critically well received

869
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Is the departure of Akira Yamaoka

870
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Because to me

871
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
He was such a key component of that franchise

872
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
I really don't see how they can continue it without him

873
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
I mean if it's true that they're just

874
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Redoing the second game

875
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
I suppose I can see that

876
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Because how much did he really

877
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
Contribute to Shattered Memories

878
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,880
I don't think he did a lot

879
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
For that game

880
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,880
Did he even do the soundtrack?

881
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Yeah he worked on the soundtrack

882
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
I think they finally learned

883
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,880
That they really can't do anything else with the series

884
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
They don't have the right kind of

885
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
I think thought process to take it where it needs to go

886
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
That's just my thought

887
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Interesting comment from the chat room

888
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Because this could

889
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Spar another discussion here

890
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
S.H.O. 100 Matt in our chat room

891
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
I remember the great horror movies of the 80s

892
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
When it was about the scare

893
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
No matter how cheesy the effects were

894
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Whereas now it's shot gore

895
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
He goes on to say the thing

896
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
80s version is better than any Saw or Hostile movie

897
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
And then somebody brought up

898
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
DJ Dark Knight says

899
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Nightmare on Elm Street, nothing more

900
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
And Friday the 13th

901
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
And it's interesting because they've remade

902
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
I mean Nightmare on Elm Street is coming out in a couple of weeks

903
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Right?

904
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
And it seems odd to me that those are not turning into games

905
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
I mean

906
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Sure there was a Friday the 13th game

907
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
Years and years ago on the NES

908
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Which by the way I enjoyed way more than most people did

909
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
Just on the tangent

910
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
I actually

911
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
I hate to say it because I know I'm going to get made fun of

912
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
But I don't care

913
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
I actually enjoyed the Friday the 13th game when I was younger

914
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
It made sense to me and I had a lot of fun playing it

915
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
It was hard as hell

916
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
That angry video game nerd

917
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
His review of it, it was funny

918
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
And there was a Nightmare on Elm Street game too

919
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,880
If I remember right

920
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Which was crap

921
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
It was crap, but if my memory is right

922
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
It was one of the very few Nintendo games

923
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
That used that four player expansion

924
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
They had

925
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Remember how they had the four player thing on the NES

926
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
There was very few games that used it

927
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,880
I know that you could change your main character

928
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
And that it was still really lame

929
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
And every character sucked

930
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
Pretty much

931
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
With the Saw and the horror franchises

932
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
Doesn't it seem odd to anyone

933
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
That there is not a video game

934
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Coming out for Nightmare on Elm Street

935
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
Or even that there wasn't one for Friday the 13th

936
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
There hasn't been one for Halloween

937
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
Or any of the horror movies

938
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
They've made in quite some time

939
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,880
No, I'm not surprised

940
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Why is that?

941
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
First you have to pay the licenses

942
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
For that and they have an idea

943
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Of how well

944
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
These games

945
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Perform

946
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
And something like that it would be kind of hard to expand on

947
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
The storyline

948
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
And stuff like for example Nightmare on Elm Street

949
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Well

950
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
What the hell would the game be about

951
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,880
I mean you basically going after

952
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Freddy I guess

953
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Or you know trying to escape him

954
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
It's just hard to expand on

955
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
How you know whether enemies and stuff

956
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
Are you going to have in it

957
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,880
It just doesn't translate well into a game

958
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
It's strange though

959
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Because so many movies that come out these days

960
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Get games with it like you know Avatar had a game

961
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Alice in Wonderland had a game

962
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Avatar learned itself very well to the game

963
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Yeah that's easy though to do

964
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
There's plenty of characters in that

965
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
That you can build a game off of

966
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
And same with the Alice in Wonderland

967
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
So there's plenty of creatures and enemies

968
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
And stuff you can create for the game

969
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
I read a very interesting article this last week

970
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
That said that

971
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
It was on Yahoo

972
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
And the little teaser was

973
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,880
This movie franchise

974
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Could have been a video game

975
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
This movie franchise

976
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Is losing tons of potential dollars

977
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Because there is no video game

978
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
And you click on it to find out what franchise they're talking about

979
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Any guess?

980
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Twilight because I read this

981
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,880
What's funny is they forgot

982
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
There is a game based on Twilight

983
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
Well it's the scenic game

984
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
That's still a game and it's based on Twilight

985
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
So they're stupid because they did the research

986
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
I blame

987
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
No

988
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
I don't want to see it either

989
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
But they make a point

990
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
It's strange that there is no

991
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Twilight video game

992
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
I don't want to see it either

993
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
It doesn't make a good game that's why

994
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
But if they make a game for Alice in Wonderland

995
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
And Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

996
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
There's more characters

997
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
Push A to sparkle

998
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Exactly it's not like

999
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
She's running around slaying

1000
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Vampires or slaying werewolves or whatever

1001
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
She's just some whiny emo chick

1002
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,880
And that's

1003
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
You can't make a game based on that

1004
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
Push B to lock the door and cry

1005
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
I mean it's seriously

1006
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
You can't, you can't really do that

1007
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
There's no

1008
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Enemies for the fight, she doesn't do that

1009
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
It doesn't translate well, they'd be like

1010
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
The equivalent of making a game based off

1011
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Of

1012
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Anything

1013
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
Like the money pit

1014
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Or you know just

1015
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
I'm getting yelled at by chatters because they're saying

1016
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Rama's saying no Twilight game for PS3 360

1017
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
That's a smart move, Tigerclaw says don't give them any ideas

1018
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Do you really want a Twilight MMO?

1019
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Again, I have zero interest in the game

1020
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
But the capitalist

1021
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
Money making

1022
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
America fuck yeah side of me

1023
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,880
That's all about making money does say

1024
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
You know a Twilight game on the Wii

1025
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
That's not, I'm talking about an actual Twilight game

1026
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Is a lost opportunity

1027
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
It really is, I have

1028
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,880
No fucking interest in it but

1029
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
I know there's a lot of girls that would play it

1030
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,880
Here's how you do it, okay, and this is how you can

1031
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Translate most of those games that don't

1032
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Necessarily, or most of those movies that don't

1033
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Necessarily work as games into games

1034
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,880
And have them still be

1035
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Alright

1036
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
You do them the way they did

1037
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
Heavy Rain

1038
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
That's the only way you can do it

1039
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
Is that you have some sort of context based

1040
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
Game

1041
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
That has a narrative

1042
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
That looks just like the movie

1043
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
That's really the only way you can do it because

1044
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
As far as being an action game

1045
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Or anything like that, you can't do that

1046
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
With these games, it makes no sense

1047
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
Frisbee in our chatroom says

1048
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
Hey, I'd like a Twilight game if you got to play

1049
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
As Blade

1050
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
They really

1051
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Could do the

1052
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
A dating sim

1053
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,880
You know

1054
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
And that would sell amongst the

1055
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,880
God, that just makes me feel dirty

1056
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
What was that shirt I saw at Hot Topic?

1057
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,880
And then Buffy staked Edward, the end

1058
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
That's great

1059
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,880
I would wear that shirt

1060
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,880
It was pretty awesome

1061
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,880
I knew you would wear that shirt, okay, sorry

1062
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
I would rock that with pride

1063
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
Look, I want to put out a formal apology to our listeners

1064
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
And everybody for bringing up Twilight on

1065
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
Orange Lontrenio, it was inappropriate of me

1066
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
And I apologize, so

1067
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
Please, let's move on with a different video game

1068
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
It'll never happen again

1069
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
I'm

1070
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
Do you think that I'm having an allergic reaction

1071
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
To that, Rob? No, you're just sparkling

1072
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
Ahh

1073
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Loki, help

1074
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
Loki, help! I'm sorry

1075
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,880
Well, one easy way to defeat

1076
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,880
The Twilight series is to take

1077
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
A nice gun with a chainsaw

1078
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
And rip it in half

1079
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880
And that's what you can possibly do in the new

1080
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,880
Gears of War game, which, funny enough

1081
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,880
Was supposed to be announced on the Jimmy Fallon

1082
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
Show, but apparently

1083
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
It got bumped to Monday

1084
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,880
And

1085
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,880
Nobody told Xbox Live

1086
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
Because apparently on the Xbox Live

1087
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,880
Marketplace, there is a wonderful banner

1088
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,880
Announcing the Gears of War 3

1089
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,880
Game, which will be

1090
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Coming April

1091
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
2011

1092
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,880
That's a year off

1093
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
Yeah

1094
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,880
And I just want to point out

1095
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
I speculated earlier this year that

1096
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
Gears of War 3 would be an E3 announcement

1097
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
So maybe I screwed that up, but

1098
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
That it was going to support Project Natal

1099
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
Is that, does that seem to be the case?

1100
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Doesn't say

1101
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Don't know, but there's been some sort of

1102
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
Rumors saying that the

1103
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,880
It will feature, I guess, underwater

1104
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
Combat this time and mech suits

1105
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
I

1106
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,880
Well, I mean, not that I think it needs

1107
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,880
To support Natal, it was just kind of my gut feeling

1108
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
Was they were really, they've been really

1109
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,880
Really quiet about such a big franchise

1110
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,880
For them, and so I kind of thought that

1111
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
It was going to be like, oh Gears of War 3

1112
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
E3 and it's Natal, that's why

1113
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,880
We've kept it so under the wrap

1114
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
Under the wraps, but

1115
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
I guess, you know

1116
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,880
We'll hear more about it, maybe

1117
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,880
If you want to watch Jimmy Fallon on Monday, I guess

1118
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Or just wait for the YouTube to hit

1119
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,880
15 minutes later

1120
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
Because, you know, I'd rather

1121
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,880
Not subject myself to

1122
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
An hour of that, I just watched the highlights

1123
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,880
Actually, I have to admit, I'm not

1124
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,880
Huge on Gears of War either, I'm just not

1125
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
Good at it, like Gears of War

1126
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,880
A, I suck at first person shooters

1127
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
To begin with, B, the thing about

1128
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
Gears of War is it's very about like cover

1129
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
And very like, like stealth and being able

1130
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,880
To move around and be very tactical

1131
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
Whereas, I like, if I'm going to play

1132
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
An FPS, I've got to play something like Quake 3

1133
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
Which is just kamikaze, run out there

1134
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,880
Shoot everybody with rocket launchers, kill kill

1135
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
Die die, you know, type of

1136
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,880
Stuff, I'm not good at Gears of War because

1137
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,880
I have, I can't cover

1138
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880
Like, I just run out and shoot everything

1139
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
And I always die

1140
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
So

1141
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,880
And it's stuff like that is why

1142
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
You know, Gears of War

1143
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
Makes a better game franchise than

1144
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,880
Twilight, because there's no

1145
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,880
Rocket launchers and

1146
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,880
I mean, there's people dying, but

1147
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,880
They just whine about it

1148
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,880
SSG100Matt

1149
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,880
Says, don't support NBC, go Team Coco

1150
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,880
So,

1151
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
It's saying that you shouldn't, you shouldn't

1152
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
Watch the show anyway, you should just wait for

1153
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,880
Whatever will show up on Xbox

1154
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,880
Live inevitably anyway

1155
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
In support of Coco

1156
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,880
Who I'm seeing live next week

1157
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
Very excited

1158
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,880
Well, yay for you Rob

1159
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,880
That's right, I should buy tickets for that

1160
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,880
I think they're all sold out everywhere

1161
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,880
Well, I meant for Sacramento

1162
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
I don't know

1163
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,880
Alright

1164
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,880
Anyhow, moving on to another story and

1165
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,880
Yeah, those tickets were pretty expensive

1166
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,880
But this is even more expensive

1167
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,880
Apparently, Warhammer Online

1168
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,880
Or Mythic Entertainment if you will

1169
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,880
The makers of Warhammer Online

1170
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,880
Somehow charged a $14.99

1171
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,880
Monthly fee several times

1172
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,880
To gamers this past week

1173
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,880
Dozens of times, in fact there's a screenshot

1174
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,880
Here of a banking record where

1175
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,880
That monthly fee was charged

1176
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,880
It looks like

1177
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,880
17 times on somebody's

1178
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,880
On somebody's banking log here

1179
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
And that means like

1180
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,880
An overcharge of like

1181
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,880
Between $200 and $500

1182
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,880
Apparently, one player is reporting

1183
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
That they were charged for

1184
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,880
$1,013.12

1185
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
Because it had just come up that a six month

1186
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,880
Subscription was up and he got charged

1187
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,880
For that like multiple times

1188
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,880
Not cool because

1189
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,880
A, you don't know what caused the error

1190
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,880
Which is gonna be bad for EA and

1191
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,880
Mythic

1192
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
They're trying to refund the fees within 24 to 36 hours

1193
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,880
But here's the problem

1194
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,880
People are gonna start bouncing

1195
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
Checks, they're gonna overdraft

1196
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,880
And they're gonna threaten

1197
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,880
Mythic or EA with this

1198
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,880
EA's gonna have to pay for all these overdraft

1199
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
Fees that they cause

1200
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Without a doubt

1201
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,880
And so that's just not pretty for them

1202
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
That sets them back, that's a big boo boo

1203
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
But you gotta be, that's the one reason

1204
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,880
To be careful with these automatic withdrawals

1205
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,880
But it stinks because so many games

1206
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,880
Kinda require them in this day and age

1207
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,880
But makes you think about maybe

1208
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,880
Using those prepaid cards instead

1209
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,880
Because you don't want something like this

1210
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,880
Happening to you I'm sure

1211
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
I mean I don't think anybody

1212
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
Did this intentionally or purposely

1213
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
I mean surely it was an error, it's just

1214
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,880
A really crappy error

1215
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,880
That is just

1216
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
Really no one wins in this scenario

1217
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,880
No one wins

1218
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
And it's not like Warhammer Online was a game that was

1219
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,880
It kinda didn't need

1220
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,880
Something like this on its reputation

1221
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,880
Right now, it's very unfortunate

1222
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,880
Can you imagine if something like that happened with WoW?

1223
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,880
Oh my gosh

1224
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,880
Oh my gosh, banks would go under

1225
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,880
From all the people that would complain

1226
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,880
And rise up

1227
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,880
My gosh

1228
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
I don't think it affected everyone that played

1229
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,880
But I think just those that probably had their statements

1230
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Renewed on a certain day but still

1231
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,880
Stinks, too bad for them

1232
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,880
Let's see

1233
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
Rama in our chat says

1234
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,880
That happened to me with a hotel for Anime Boston

1235
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,880
Took them two weeks to refund my money

1236
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,880
So, so irritating

1237
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,880
That companies can do that

1238
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,880
But you know what, if it results in overdraft fees

1239
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,880
And it's this company's fault

1240
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,880
You should take them to task for it

1241
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,880
They'll refund the money, they have to

1242
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,880
Alright, anyhow

1243
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,880
That's messed up

1244
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,880
I know

1245
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,880
I mean, I looked at that and I was just like

1246
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,880
Yet another reason to hate Warhammer

1247
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,880
You know what though, that could have happened at any game though

1248
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,880
Because I would bet money

1249
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,880
That EA Mythic contracts another company to handle all this

1250
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,880
And that company botched up

1251
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,880
And it's just really unfortunate

1252
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,880
Because like I said, yeah, Warhammer already

1253
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,880
Hasn't had the greatest rep

1254
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,880
I mean, it has its loyal fan base

1255
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
But it's definitely not been the wow killer

1256
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,880
It was originally imagined to be

1257
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,880
I played it for a while, it was okay

1258
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,880
It's just, you know, I didn't get everything out of it

1259
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
I was hoping for

1260
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
Well, how about something happier?

1261
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,880
How about it?

1262
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,880
Doctor Who?

1263
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,880
On PC, we get a Doctor Who game

1264
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,880
Who?

1265
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,880
Doctor

1266
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,880
Who?

1267
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
Do not make me go hunt down my sonic screwdriver please

1268
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,880
Anyway

1269
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,880
Starting on June 2010

1270
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
There are going to be four

1271
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,880
Interactive episodes

1272
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,880
That are going to be free on the

1273
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,880
BBC Doctor Who website

1274
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,880
With the current cast

1275
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,880
And the new producer, writer guy

1276
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,880
And

1277
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,880
A lot of

1278
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,880
The story elements, I guess, going on with what's currently

1279
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,880
I guess going to happen in this season

1280
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,880
And it's being developed by Sumo Digital

1281
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,880
They

1282
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
It actually was said by

1283
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,880
The head of drama for BBC Wales

1284
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,880
The executive producer for Doctor Who

1285
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,880
The director of the series

1286
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,880
The director of the series

1287
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,880
The executive producer for Doctor Who

1288
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,880
There aren't going to be

1289
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,880
13 episodes

1290
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,880
There will be 17 of which

1291
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,880
Are interactive

1292
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,880
Interesting

1293
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,880
So they're really considering this part of the television arc

1294
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
Yep

1295
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,880
Of course if they let us download it over here

1296
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,880
Then I will

1297
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,880
Talk to people

1298
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,880
Yeah, exactly

1299
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,880
Torchwood?

1300
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,880
Any chance we can get a Torchwood game?

1301
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
Are we ever going to ever get Torchwood?

1302
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,880
No, it's over

1303
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,880
But that doesn't mean they won't do games

1304
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,880
Yes it does

1305
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
They ended it, they completely ended it

1306
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,880
But can't they go back and do games

1307
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,880
From, you know, the canon earlier

1308
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,880
In the show or something?

1309
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,880
I seriously doubt that's going to happen

1310
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,880
They do that all the time with franchises that are over

1311
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,880
They reinvigorate it for a game

1312
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,880
Okay, I'll give you that

1313
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,880
Where's my northern exposure?

1314
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,880
Shut up

1315
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,880
Actually, I'll say this not to deviate

1316
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,880
To sci-fi nerd-dom for a minute here

1317
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,880
But wasn't there a talk that Fox wanted to do

1318
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,880
An American version of Torchwood?

1319
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,880
Dear God, no, I hope not

1320
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,880
And something about

1321
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,880
The guy, why can't I remember his name?

1322
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,880
The guy that plays Captain Jack

1323
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,880
They actually were thinking of having him

1324
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,880
Do it

1325
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,880
No, um

1326
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
Not that Captain Jack, the other one

1327
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,880
Why can't I remember his name? Oh my God

1328
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,880
John Barrowman

1329
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
The guy that played Captain Jack

1330
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,880
And sang all those songs and dressed up like a captain

1331
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,880
With hoochies hanging off of him

1332
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,880
That Captain Jack?

1333
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,880
No, not that Captain Jack

1334
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,880
John Barrowman

1335
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,880
This is Captain Jack

1336
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,880
It's such a common name

1337
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
How about release dates, Loki?

1338
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Captain Gack

1339
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,880
This week, there's

1340
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,880
Well, there's not a lot because we're in the month of April

1341
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
And April's really light

1342
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
There are some notable things

1343
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,880
First off, of course

1344
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,880
Splinter Cell Conviction

1345
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,880
Coming out on Xbox 360

1346
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,880
That's pretty sweet

1347
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,880
Grand Theft Auto episodes

1348
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
From Liberty City

1349
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,880
Making its way out onto the Playstation 3

1350
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,880
As well as PC

1351
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
Blood Bowl finally coming out

1352
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,880
On PSP this week as well

1353
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,880
And there's gonna be

1354
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,880
Nothing else, I guess

1355
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,880
That is one hell of a light week

1356
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,880
Alright, let's go to

1357
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,880
I need to say something real quick

1358
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,880
Okay

1359
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,880
Since I hate having to spell this shit out

1360
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,880
Because apparently I do every time I state something

1361
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,880
That's my opinion

1362
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,880
When I say something is over

1363
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,880
I'm typically meaning it's over for me

1364
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,880
I don't care

1365
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,880
It's good

1366
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,880
It's over for me, I don't care

1367
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,880
It's gone

1368
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,880
Okay, well I took what you said to mean that the show is actually over

1369
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,880
So it's not over, it's just you've written it off

1370
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,880
Because you don't like the direction it's going in

1371
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,880
They got rid of everybody

1372
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,880
Except for one person

1373
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,880
There's nothing more in that for me to watch

1374
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,880
Okay, well as someone who doesn't watch the show

1375
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,880
I have no idea, so there you go

1376
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,880
Alright, Japanese release dates

1377
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,880
No More Heroes

1378
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880
Is coming out on the Xbox 360

1379
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,880
And yeah, I heard about that

1380
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,880
That they were going to remake that for the 360

1381
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,880
Because mature games don't do very well on the Wii

1382
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,880
It's going to be awesome

1383
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,880
So there it is on its way on the 360 this week

1384
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,880
And there's lots of people like Loki

1385
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,880
Who will probably use his new JTAG

1386
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,880
Not creepy and ominously donated 360 to play

1387
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,880
It could be a bomb, I haven't opened it up yet

1388
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,880
Loki

1389
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,880
I'm going to get that screen somewhere

1390
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,880
Alright, on the Playstation 3

1391
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,880
Also gets a version of No More Heroes

1392
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,880
As well, it's a pretty dry week otherwise

1393
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,880
I guess that's kind of the anchor

1394
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,880
And there you go, you can import the PS3 version

1395
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,880
If you don't have a modded console

1396
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
That's true, because PS3 is region free

1397
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,880
Of course it's all going to be in Japanese

1398
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
But who cares

1399
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,880
Might be able to get through it anyway

1400
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,880
Nintendo Wii, not a thing this week

1401
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,880
You got to wait until the 22nd for really any new games

1402
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,880
Playstation 2

1403
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,880
Clover no Kunen no Alice comes out

1404
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,880
As well as Psycho Shogi

1405
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,880
Gekyashashi Special

1406
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,880
That's just a price reduction

1407
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,880
About the equivalent of 20 bucks in Japan

1408
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,880
So look for that, that's a gambling game though

1409
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,880
I mean really, do you guys import gambling games?

1410
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,880
I don't think you do

1411
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,880
On the Nintendo DS, Let's Science with Marie and Gully

1412
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,880
That's a big game coming out this week

1413
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,880
On the Nintendo DS

1414
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,880
I've never heard of this game

1415
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,880
Let's Science, is that like Science Mama?

1416
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,880
I don't know

1417
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,880
I know it has little equations in it

1418
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,880
And all this other stuff

1419
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,880
Dekitayo Mama

1420
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,880
Mitsugo no Kumasan

1421
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,880
Otoko no Koko

1422
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,880
That is not Cookie Mama, I thought it was

1423
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,880
Because I saw Mama in the title

1424
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,880
Otoko means boy

1425
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,880
It's like a boy's hero

1426
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,880
Here's a boy

1427
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,880
Like a child's playground or something

1428
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,880
Anyhow

1429
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,880
That's the DS

1430
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,880
Quickly looking at the PSP

1431
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
Sokoku no Kusabi

1432
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,880
Hiro no Kakara 3 comes out this week

1433
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,880
That is

1434
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,880
An action game

1435
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,880
I'm trying to see if this is an established franchise

1436
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,880
Because it's 3

1437
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,880
I don't recognize it

1438
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,880
It looks like it's based on an anime

1439
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,880
Because it has really pretty cut scene looking things in it

1440
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
A lot of talking and chatting in the game

1441
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,880
Can't tell what that is though

1442
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,880
Sorry, I'm not up to speed on all of my Japanese

1443
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,880
What is this?

1444
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,880
Maybe this is it

1445
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,880
There's a limited edition of it coming out as well

1446
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,880
I was trying to see if that would tell me what it is

1447
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,880
Nope

1448
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,880
Oh well

1449
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
That's coming out on the PSP

1450
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,880
And that's it for Japanese release dates

1451
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
Dark Sakura, how about

1452
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,880
Yeah, I just smacked the thing

1453
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,880
How about The Old Kingdom

1454
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
Well, on the 15th we have Final Fight Double Impact

1455
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,880
We have Sam & Max The Devil's Playground Episode 1

1456
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,880
The Penal Zone

1457
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,880
And on the 16th we have

1458
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,880
Samurai Shodown Sen

1459
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,880
Grand Theft Auto 4

1460
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,880
Episodes from Liberty City

1461
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,880
And Splinter Cell Conviction

1462
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,880
Just a few more stories for you guys

1463
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,880
Then we're going to get into the classic game of the week

1464
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,880
But first

1465
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,880
A few more news stories for you guys

1466
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,880
Loki

1467
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,880
Yes, of course with the new update

1468
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,880
3.21

1469
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,880
That removes

1470
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,880
Linux from the Playstation 3

1471
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,880
Which is retarded

1472
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,880
I'll just tell you right now

1473
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,880
Yeah, you weren't here last week

1474
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,880
I'm really curious about your thoughts on this whole thing

1475
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,880
But you know, both Dark Sakura and I were kind of just like

1476
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,880
Well, we haven't really used it

1477
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,880
I mean, Dark Sakura is a Linux fan

1478
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,880
So obviously she's disappointed

1479
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,880
I don't know, what do you think?

1480
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,880
Since Sonya made a big to-do about

1481
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,880
Trying to patch it up, I'm not updating my system

1482
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,880
Until I see what happens

1483
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,880
Don't you kind of have to?

1484
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,880
If you want to play anything online

1485
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,880
Because it does that whole thing where it says

1486
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,880
There is a system update available

1487
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,880
If you want to connect to Playstation Network for anything

1488
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,880
You have to upgrade

1489
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,880
I don't connect to Playstation Network

1490
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,880
Because I don't play anything on it

1491
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,880
Well then you'll be fine, I'm just saying

1492
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,880
I mean, even to like

1493
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,880
Have the online leaderboards or anything

1494
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
You can't play those without

1495
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,880
Updating

1496
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
Because my system wasn't updated

1497
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,880
I haven't played anything on Playstation 3 this week

1498
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,880
But I went into a game on there the other night

1499
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,880
Actually I was showing a friend our little cameo

1500
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,880
In the Namco Museum game

1501
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,880
But that game wants to connect for leaderboards

1502
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,880
And it was not working right

1503
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,880
Because it needed me to update

1504
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,880
That's when you unhook it from the internet

1505
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,880
I'm just saying, you're going to be very limited

1506
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,880
Until you update

1507
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,880
I'm okay

1508
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,880
Anyways, so what's important about this is

1509
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,880
Apparently the guy GeoHot

1510
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,880
Who has done different

1511
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,880
Hacks on the iPhone

1512
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,880
And whatnot

1513
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,880
He's one of the first guys

1514
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Jail broke some of those I guess

1515
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Anyways

1516
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,880
So he is

1517
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,880
He put out a video

1518
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,880
That shows him with the

1519
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,880
A modded 3.21

1520
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
System with actually

1521
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,880
The option to install the other OS

1522
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,880
Still, so basically

1523
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,880
He patched out their patch

1524
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
And just added the update or something

1525
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,880
And he says it's very easy to do

1526
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,880
But he also says that he's

1527
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
Not going to necessarily program anything

1528
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,880
So that people can

1529
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,880
Build like

1530
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,880
You know

1531
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,880
At least the pirate stuff

1532
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,880
But right now it's just doing it for the other operating system

1533
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,880
But that makes me wonder

1534
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,880
How long

1535
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,880
Because it's just a matter of time

1536
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,880
And in fact actually

1537
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,880
His quote basically

1538
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,880
He says

1539
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,880
Basically saying that because of this

1540
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,880
They've potentially turned

1541
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,880
100,000 plus legit

1542
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,880
Users into hackers

1543
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,880
Because now they're going to try to find

1544
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,880
They weren't caring before about trying to

1545
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,880
Break it to add Linux to it

1546
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,880
But now that they're removing it

1547
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,880
They're going to be more diligent in trying to

1548
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,880
Hack the PS3

1549
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
Well it also just seems like no surprise that

1550
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,880
You know this was cracked in minutes

1551
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,880
You know

1552
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,880
Is essentially what Sony did

1553
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,880
Is they just released something that didn't like

1554
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,880
Actually remove the feature

1555
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,880
But just like remove the menu item

1556
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,880
Or something you know

1557
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,880
It sounds like this hack was so

1558
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,880
Easy that this guy did

1559
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,880
Like Sony didn't really take it out

1560
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
They just took out your ability to access it

1561
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
Well the PS3 and the PSP

1562
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,880
For example their operating systems

1563
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
Are very similar especially the way

1564
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,880
Their patch files and stuff come over

1565
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,880
That you know if you're familiar with the PSP

1566
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,880
You're probably going to have an easy way

1567
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,880
Around the Playstation 3

1568
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
It's just there's certain things

1569
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,880
That they haven't figured out yet

1570
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,880
And apparently this guy has figured out ways

1571
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
Around it

1572
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,880
Now another kind of story that ties in with this

1573
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,880
Is apparently there was a guy

1574
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,880
A European PS3 owner who

1575
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,880
Received I guess

1576
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,880
A credit for

1577
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,880
You know about 84 pounds

1578
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
I guess

1579
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,880
From Amazon because

1580
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,880
He filed a complaint with the retailer

1581
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
Saying that the firmware update

1582
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,880
Violated some sort of

1583
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,880
European law

1584
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
Basically saying that the console

1585
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,880
No longer performed as advertised

1586
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
And you know and I do think that

1587
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
Is something though I mean if you're putting

1588
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,880
On the box or you had on the box

1589
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
Right now they have all these slim systems and stuff

1590
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,880
Just before you go there

1591
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,880
In the US it's not on the box

1592
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
I can't speak for the UK but I only know this

1593
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,880
Cause last week on Bobby's show cause right before the call

1594
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,880
He actually had the box and he said it's not on the box

1595
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,880
Ok but still though

1596
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,880
I don't know about the UK but this is the US

1597
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,880
It was still a feature though that they advertised

1598
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,880
And then I guess

1599
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,880
But I guess you could say the same thing with

1600
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,880
Playstation 2 backwards compatibility

1601
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
It was something that you know

1602
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,880
They removed from

1603
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
Their new systems but it's not like

1604
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,880
It was there on those systems

1605
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,880
To begin with and then they took it out because

1606
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,880
You know what hey we just don't want you to play

1607
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
Playstation 2 games anymore

1608
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
It's still no matter how insignificant

1609
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,880
It is it still sucks

1610
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,880
That they removed it because

1611
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,880
I mean this is something

1612
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,880
You may be paying for and granted it's not a feature

1613
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,880
That I use but that'd be the same thing

1614
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,880
If like oh well I don't really watch

1615
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,880
Blu-ray movies on my you know PS3

1616
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,880
And then they send a patch over that you know

1617
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,880
Now prevents me from watching

1618
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,880
Blu-ray movies

1619
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,880
Granted it wasn't a feature I was using

1620
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,880
It's still like you're removing a feature

1621
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,880
Off the console

1622
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,880
And yeah

1623
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
People should be pissed because

1624
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Granted they're doing this for security reasons

1625
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,880
But what if they

1626
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,880
Find a way around you know

1627
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,880
Something else

1628
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,880
What other features are going to be removed

1629
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,880
I don't know

1630
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,880
It's just a case of a couple

1631
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,880
Bad apples ruining the barrel I think

1632
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,880
You know but I think it was a little silly for

1633
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,880
You know I said this earlier but I think it was

1634
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,880
Silly for Sony to put that feature in in the

1635
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
First place

1636
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,880
If they're closing it up because

1637
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
Of piracy because Linux kind of lent itself

1638
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,880
To piracy anyway and I'm not talking about PS3

1639
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,880
Necessarily but everybody knew there was emulators

1640
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,880
Out there for the NES and you know

1641
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,880
But see now though with Linux

1642
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,880
Installed on these systems they can sell you know

1643
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,880
A ton of them to different like universities

1644
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
Or whatever using them as number crunchers

1645
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,880
It's an easy way to make up some console

1646
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,880
Sales you know just uh

1647
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
Hey look you can run Linux on it it's like a little

1648
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,880
Portable super computer you know they're even

1649
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,880
Saying oh yeah it's you know it's

1650
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
A computer system it's not a game system

1651
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,880
It's a computer system

1652
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
You know when of course the rumors

1653
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,880
Were that they were doing that to evade taxes

1654
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,880
Or whatever but uh

1655
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,880
Still though now you're

1656
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,880
I don't know

1657
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,880
It's

1658
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,880
They can do whatever they want I guess because

1659
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
Since you know then user license agreement

1660
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,880
Anyways just basically says you're leasing the

1661
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,880
Console from them so

1662
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,880
If they want to take features away I guess they can

1663
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,880
But I you know

1664
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,880
As a consumer I will

1665
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
Probably think twice when it comes to the next

1666
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,880
PlayStation system that they are

1667
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,880
Advertising you know can do such

1668
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,880
And such things you'll probably think twice

1669
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,880
You know hey

1670
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
Move later because it doesn't go their

1671
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
Way

1672
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,880
It is very interesting that they can just

1673
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,880
Kind of do that I mean I'm and we

1674
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,880
All accept that because it's in the

1675
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
Agreements that we you know hit

1676
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,880
A to get through real fast you know

1677
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,880
Hun the Xbox

1678
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,880
It just seems

1679
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,880
I don't know

1680
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,880
Well and also if you ever

1681
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,880
Happen to click no then you just

1682
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,880
Don't get to use it right? Exactly

1683
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,880
I don't know it just seems

1684
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,880
It's just kind of

1685
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,880
Sad there's nothing to protect me

1686
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,880
It would be different if it was just

1687
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,880
Connecting to their online service and I

1688
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,880
Understand yes they can prevent you from

1689
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,880
Going to their online service for whatever

1690
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,880
Reason if they want you to update and you don't want to

1691
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,880
Then fine you can't connect to their online service

1692
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,880
But you know

1693
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,880
Offline games if you pop in a game or

1694
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Whatever it will just automatically patch your system

1695
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,880
Up anyways you can't just say

1696
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,880
No I don't want to install this patch

1697
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,880
It's going to do it regardless

1698
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,880
And they do it obviously as a security feature

1699
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
So that you know you can't go and hack

1700
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,880
The Playstation 3 but

1701
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,880
Whatever

1702
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,880
Then maybe they should have figured out a way to be able to

1703
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,880
Leave the operating system on there and not

1704
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
Have it you know

1705
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
Have access to whatever that's

1706
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,880
On the Playstation 3 that you can apparently

1707
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,880
Hack the system with

1708
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Alright

1709
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,880
Well turning to something

1710
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,880
That is an old

1711
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
Standby and reliable and you know

1712
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,880
These are always coming and not going to get taken away from you

1713
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,880
Pokemon that's right

1714
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,880
Taking a step over to the Nintendo systems

1715
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,880
Pokemon obviously those

1716
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,880
Other games the what was it

1717
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,880
Gold and silver remakes were

1718
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,880
Released not that long ago and they come with little

1719
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,880
Trainers that were all over

1720
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,880
PAX East well

1721
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,880
The games were successful enough

1722
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,880
Obviously I mean the Pokemon

1723
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,880
Black and Pokemon White have been announced

1724
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,880
Those are the newest games for the Pokemon

1725
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,880
Series they are going to be

1726
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,880
Coming out this fall in Japan for the

1727
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
Nintendo DS that is

1728
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,880
DS not the 3DS

1729
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,880
So these are still games I mean obviously the 3DS

1730
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,880
Will play them as we know about

1731
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,880
The 3DS so far but these games are being

1732
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,880
Developed for the DS

1733
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,880
More info is supposed to come in the next few weeks but the game

1734
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,880
Is supposed to be out in fall and I imagine we'll see some of this

1735
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,880
At E3 as well even though

1736
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
The logo design is gorgeous

1737
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
Even though the games probably won't come out in America for some time

1738
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,880
What is so gorgeous about the design for you?

1739
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,880
I just like it I just really like it it's

1740
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,880
Copping I have this thing for

1741
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,880
Black and White

1742
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,880
And just with the red Pokeball in the background I think it's

1743
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,880
Actually really eye catching and really well done

1744
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,880
It's very interesting that they decided

1745
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,880
Just to go with Black and White

1746
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,880
Like you know just very

1747
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,880
Plain colors if you will

1748
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,880
None of this like Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald

1749
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,880
Black and White

1750
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,880
Honestly I think using

1751
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,880
Black and White is

1752
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,880
I always thought of just using

1753
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,880
Black and White as being more classy

1754
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,880
Than going for the

1755
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
Sparkly poo

1756
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,880
So a classier more refined Pokemon?

1757
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,880
I think so I think that it takes a lot more talent

1758
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,880
I mean I just

1759
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880
I prefer things being

1760
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,880
You know pretty clean

1761
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,880
In how they're you know done

1762
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
Honestly I like the logo

1763
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,880
The fact that I can actually look at it

1764
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,880
And read it right away

1765
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,880
I was kind of impressed with myself

1766
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,880
Act F in our chat room says the third version

1767
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,880
Is going to be gray

1768
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,880
Make it easy huh?

1769
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
Uh yep so more Pokemon

1770
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,880
I'm just kind of surprised this information

1771
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,880
Is coming out so soon after the release of the games

1772
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,880
We just had here but at the same time

1773
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,880
We have to remember

1774
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,880
This news was tailored for Japan not really

1775
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,880
For the US and those games have been out in Japan

1776
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,880
For some time it's kind of like the news about the 3DS

1777
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,880
Came out what like the day

1778
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
That the DSIXL was released here

1779
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
Interesting

1780
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,880
We can only learn from like you know another

1781
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
Company that has announced a revision

1782
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,880
To their system

1783
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,880
Right as they're launching their system

1784
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,880
Hmm

1785
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,880
That hasn't happened before has it?

1786
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,880
Oh wait no it has

1787
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,880
Yeah

1788
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880
Bochi Kawa in our chat room says classy Pokemon

1789
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,880
A squirrel in a top hat with a cane

1790
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,880
Possibly

1791
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,880
And Frisbee in chat says there's my problem

1792
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,880
I don't know if I should buy black or white

1793
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,880
Or wait for

1794
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
Gray since it's inevitable

1795
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,880
There will be a third version as well

1796
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,880
It's like they have this stuff down to a

1797
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,880
Science now how to milk the most money out of you

1798
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,880
Pokey fans

1799
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,880
I don't know I guess I'll buy it if it's good

1800
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,880
I'm tempted for some weird reason I can't even

1801
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,880
Explain to buy that DS one just cause it seems

1802
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,880
So freaking popular

1803
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,880
But I'll just have to shake the walking trainer cause you know

1804
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,880
See gray will come out

1805
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,880
On the 3DS

1806
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,880
Maybe you never know

1807
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
Alright well let's stop talking about the new stuff

1808
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,880
I'm gonna send it to pay some tribute to the old stuff

1809
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,880
Every week here on the show

1810
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,880
We like to take a look at gaming's past

1811
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,880
And take a trip to the classic vault

1812
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,880
And look at the classic video game

1813
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,880
Of the week where Dark Soccer will pick one game

1814
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,880
From the archives and she says you know what

1815
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,880
You ungrateful kids

1816
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,880
Playing with your Pokeymans all day and collecting your mudkips

1817
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,880
You should take some time out

1818
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,880
To pay tribute

1819
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,880
To those that paved the way for these games

1820
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
It's the classic game of the week Dark Soccer

1821
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,880
For the kids tonight

1822
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,880
The game I have chosen is Samurai Shodown 2

1823
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,880
Samurai Shodown 2

1824
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,880
I'm starting with the sequel

1825
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,880
I love this series so much

1826
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,880
The Japanese title is

1827
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,880
Shin Samurai Spirits

1828
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,880
Haomaru Jigokuen

1829
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,880
So it translates to

1830
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,880
True Samurai Spirits Haomaru's Portrait of Hell

1831
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,880
It is a fighting game

1832
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,880
It does the big in and out scrolling

1833
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,880
Depending on how far everybody is across the screen

1834
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,880
It also has a bunch of easter eggs in it

1835
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,880
Which I think is absolutely fun

1836
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,880
And has the pow meter

1837
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,880
Ooh pow

1838
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,880
I actually own this game

1839
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,880
On Mio Geo

1840
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,880
I have the cartridge

1841
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,880
Well technically I have the Japanese cartridge

1842
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,880
But you know you can actually switch

1843
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,880
Your country of origin on it

1844
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,880
And it changes your blood to sweat

1845
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,880
And back and forth

1846
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,880
Like this is from the Japanese version clearly

1847
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,880
Cause there is blood everywhere

1848
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,880
It's white sweat for the US one

1849
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,880
But this one had

1850
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,880
Some of the best characters in it

1851
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Actually like

1852
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,880
I have to say three of my favorite characters

1853
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,880
Came about in this game

1854
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,880
Is uh

1855
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,880
Kibagami Genjuro

1856
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,880
Who was Haomaru's rival

1857
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,880
Cham Cham who replaced Tam Tam

1858
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,880
The little cat girl

1859
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,880
And she was fun

1860
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
She had like the giant boomerang

1861
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
And I don't know that she has been in anything else

1862
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,880
She was fantastic

1863
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,880
We had Nihot Saiger

1864
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,880
Who was the

1865
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,880
Oppression knight with the huge mungus gauntlet

1866
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,880
Another one I liked was

1867
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,880
Kathy Nicotine

1868
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,880
Who was this little monk

1869
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,880
He was so fun

1870
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,880
He could turn himself into a statue

1871
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,880
Kuroko

1872
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,880
Who was a hidden boss in the game

1873
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,880
Who was actually the little guy that wears all black

1874
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,880
That waves the flags

1875
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,880
If anyone who doesn't really know

1876
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,880
So much about

1877
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,880
I would say

1878
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,880
Japanese theater

1879
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,880
Kuroko is like

1880
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,880
A stage hand

1881
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,880
The person who goes behind the scenes

1882
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,880
Wears all black

1883
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,880
He's supposed to be invisible

1884
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,880
He'll be like a prop or something

1885
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,880
Or change scenery

1886
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,880
It's a cool music video

1887
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,880
That uses all that

1888
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,880
It's a sister sister's video

1889
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,880
I can't remember what song it was

1890
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,880
Except that he's not on a black screen

1891
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,880
He's just a dude in black

1892
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,880
Hanging out by the scenery

1893
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,880
It's like what I would do in Rocky

1894
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,880
Before I was the curtain

1895
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,880
Right

1896
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,880
Yeah, Rocky used to climb up on me

1897
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,880
A couple of times

1898
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,880
Let's not give the listeners the wrong impression

1899
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,880
Of our friendship

1900
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
No

1901
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
There was also

1902
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
A new

1903
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,880
Female boss in the game

1904
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,880
Um

1905
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,880
Named

1906
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,880
Rashojin Mizuki

1907
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,880
Yeah, Amakusa was not female

1908
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,880
Amakusa was just a girly dude

1909
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,880
Um

1910
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
You also

1911
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,880
Had a blocking

1912
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,880
And a parry technique

1913
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,880
Um

1914
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,880
Basically

1915
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,880
You would, you know, push

1916
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,880
Against sword to sword, you'd lock

1917
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,880
And then whoever came across it

1918
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,880
Could get in a hit that was unlockable

1919
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,880
And they actually

1920
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,880
Borrowed that for Street Fighter 3

1921
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,880
Well, the kind of parry thing

1922
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,880
The parry thing in Street Fighter 3 was different

1923
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,880
Um

1924
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,880
You, um

1925
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,880
There were cameos from other SNK characters

1926
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,880
And different stuff would happen

1927
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,880
My favorite easter eggs though

1928
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,880
A weird little move that you could do

1929
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,880
With each of the characters

1930
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,880
That would make them chibi

1931
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,880
They'd just be little chibi, cutesy versions

1932
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,880
They would just show up chibi

1933
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,880
I did one by accident one time

1934
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,880
And I was like, dude, that's kinda cool

1935
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,880
Um

1936
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,880
It actually, um

1937
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,880
It was better received than the first one

1938
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,880
And the first one, don't get me wrong, was great

1939
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,880
But this one just took stuff that worked

1940
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,880
And made it even better

1941
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,880
It seriously, to me

1942
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,880
It's one of my favorite games ever

1943
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,880
It's up there, I'd put this up there

1944
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
In the top ten, probably one of my favorite

1945
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,880
Fighting games ever

1946
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,880
Um

1947
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,880
As far as versions that came out

1948
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,880
Um

1949
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,880
It only came out on Neo Geo

1950
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,880
For like the longest time

1951
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,880
Um

1952
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,880
And then there was the Neo Geo CD version

1953
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,880
Came out for Windows

1954
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,880
And then

1955
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,880
It actually, that version actually

1956
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,880
Came out in the US

1957
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,880
Um, there was a Playstation version that came out

1958
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,880
In Samurai Spirit's Kenkaku Shinan Pack

1959
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,880
Which, um, was the first two

1960
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,880
And it only came out in Japan

1961
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,880
And then the 2007 Tokyo Game Show

1962
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,880
Um, there was an Xbox Live Arcade

1963
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,880
And a PS2 Wii Anthology

1964
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,880
Were announced

1965
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,880
So

1966
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,880
Um

1967
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
It's

1968
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,880
I, this is seriously

1969
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,880
A fantastic game

1970
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,880
It's one of, like I said, one of my favorites

1971
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,880
And I think

1972
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,880
Out of all of them, the only

1973
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,880
Actually, no, I'd probably say that this one is my favorite

1974
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,880
The only reason

1975
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,880
That I would actually sometimes pick Samurai Spirit on three

1976
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,880
Over two, sometimes

1977
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,880
Is just to play as Rimuru

1978
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,880
Cause she had the, um, the ice skin

1979
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,880
Rimuru?

1980
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,880
Bite Me Rob

1981
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,880
That's her name, is Bite Me Rob

1982
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
And then I'll go grab my cartridge in a second

1983
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,880
That's it

1984
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,880
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week

1985
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,880
Samurai Showdown 2

1986
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,880
Not one, not three, two

1987
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
But you'll probably see one and three

1988
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,880
In future weeks

1989
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,880
When Jamie starts running out of games

1990
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,880
Cause you've been doing this a while now, gosh

1991
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,880
This is probably, like, the 100th game of the week

1992
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,880
Rob, you've seen The Vault

1993
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,880
I know

1994
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,880
I've got a couple thousand games in there

1995
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,880
I'm not going to run out

1996
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,880
Alright

1997
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,880
Well, he's scraping the obscure if you really want to get to it

1998
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,880
What are you going to do when you run out of Sega?

1999
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,880
I don't think I'm going to run out of Sega

2000
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,880
Alright, we'll see

2001
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,880
Alright, anyhow

2002
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,880
For now though, we're going to take a quick break

2003
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,880
But we'll come back, there's still plenty more to talk about tonight

2004
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,880
You know, we haven't even touched the big iPhone news this week

2005
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,880
And yes, it does affect gaming

2006
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,880
We're going to talk some Red Dead Redemption

2007
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,880
Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption

2008
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,880
That's like Hammer Rimuru

2009
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,880
And we're going to talk about

2010
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,880
Some of the Microsoft changes to live

2011
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,880
That are going to be kind of interesting

2012
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,880
Especially for those of you that like to play games on the computer

2013
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,880
Talk about a lot of that

2014
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,880
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2015
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,880
So stick around, folks

2016
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,880
We will be right back

2017
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,880
And for those of you guys listening live tonight

2018
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,880
On All Games Radio, we're going to take a quick music break

2019
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,880
Stay tuned with us

2020
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,880
Just a little bit of Poperia music tonight to listen to

2021
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,880
We're going to be back in a few minutes

2022
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,880
While we just take a second to rest our voices and so forth

2023
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,880
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

2024
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,880
We'll be right back

2025
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,880
Welcome back everybody

2026
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,880
To more of Orange Lounge Radio

2027
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,880
On this Sunday night, April the 11th of 2010

2028
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,880
We're joining you for our

2029
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,880
362nd episode of the show

2030
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,880
We're into Part B right now, the second half of our show

2031
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,880
We have some rapid fire news coming up

2032
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,880
And of course, Twitter topics

2033
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,880
Just got a few more minutes to get those in

2034
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,880
We already have quite a few though

2035
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,880
If you want to ask us something on Twitter

2036
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,880
And still some more news to get to

2037
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,880
In tonight's program

2038
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,880
Lots and lots of good stuff

2039
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,880
Loki, why don't you kick it off with some rapid fire news

2040
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,880
Yes, as it's been kind of a trend lately

2041
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,880
There's been a lot of good games

2042
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,880
Coming to the Xbox

2043
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,880
Indie game service

2044
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,880
And actually

2045
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
Kind of not a stranger to

2046
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
Doing some of these smaller

2047
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,880
Indie games out there, Gameloft

2048
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,880
They have decided to put a game on there called

2049
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,880
Tank Battles

2050
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,880
Actually it's pretty sweet

2051
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,880
Kind of a high quality

2052
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,880
Tank battling game

2053
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,880
Almost like a souped up combat

2054
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,880
If you will

2055
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,880
And apparently it's kind of a port of

2056
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,880
I want to say it's going to be a mobile game as well

2057
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,880
And

2058
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,880
Actually apparently it's been

2059
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,880
Released last year on the Playstation

2060
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,880
Network as Battle Tanks

2061
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,880
Not sure why it hasn't been brought to

2062
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,880
Xbox Live Arcade

2063
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,880
Hey that's kind of cool anyways

2064
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,880
How many of those games from the

2065
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,880
Indie games have crossed over to regular

2066
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,880
Xbox Live, hasn't there been like one?

2067
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,880
Uh

2068
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,880
Weren't they saying some time ago

2069
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,880
That either there were going to be more that would cross over

2070
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,880
To actual games or am I just

2071
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,880
Making stuff up?

2072
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,880
They do like a contest I want to say each year

2073
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,880
And there's some that come out of that

2074
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,880
But

2075
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,880
Well no, they do a

2076
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,880
Contest once a year

2077
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,880
And they rarely port just one game from that

2078
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,880
Um

2079
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,880
But

2080
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,880
I don't see a lot of them coming over the Xbox Live Arcade

2081
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,880
But I don't really think it needs to because

2082
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,880
Especially the ones that do win the

2083
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,880
Contest they do get singled out

2084
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,880
You can select I think

2085
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,880
Contest winners or

2086
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,880
Competition winners or whatever and you can actually see those

2087
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,880
And then also of course now

2088
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,880
With the new rating system and stuff

2089
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,880
Um

2090
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,880
It allows games that are actually pretty good

2091
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,880
To make it to the forefront so people can sort through

2092
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,880
All the hundreds of games that are on there

2093
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,880
So um

2094
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,880
It's not

2095
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,880
Horrible, I don't know, it's getting better

2096
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,880
That's for sure

2097
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,880
Lots more games are coming out on there

2098
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,880
Um

2099
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,880
Now one game that we of course are not going to

2100
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,880
Probably see on Indie games but

2101
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,880
Perhaps an Xbox Live Arcade release

2102
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,880
Or maybe something on the Playstation network

2103
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,880
Who knows, um, Rocket Knight

2104
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,880
Another game coming out

2105
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,880
Of course you may remember Rocket Knight

2106
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,880
I believe was an old Konami franchise

2107
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,880
And um

2108
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,880
Apparently this is going to be coming out soon

2109
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,880
Um

2110
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,880
Actually I believe in May

2111
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,880
Which is pretty awesome

2112
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,880
Not a series I can

2113
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,880
Say I remember, maybe if I saw screenshots

2114
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,880
It was um

2115
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,880
I don't know if

2116
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,880
It was like a 2D action game

2117
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,880
And it will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade

2118
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,880
PlayStation Network and Steam

2119
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,880
And it was um, originally a 16 bit game

2120
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,880
I want to see what was on like the

2121
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,880
Super Nintendo

2122
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,880
I don't know

2123
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,880
But uh, yeah I don't know if the screen should

2124
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,880
It's kind of souped up looking

2125
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,880
So obviously the screenshots probably don't

2126
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,880
Bring back any memories of the original game

2127
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,880
But uh, looks neat

2128
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,880
Alright, so that'll be coming out

2129
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,880
Um

2130
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,880
And then finally

2131
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,880
Another Xbox Live Arcade game

2132
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,880
Uh

2133
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,880
And also going to be coming on Steam as well

2134
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,880
Uh, Serious Sam HD

2135
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,880
The second encounter is of course

2136
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,880
Getting its um

2137
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,880
Brand new HD remake I guess

2138
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,880
And uh, should be coming

2139
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,880
To Xbox Live soon

2140
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,880
Um

2141
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,880
They haven't really made an official date yet for

2142
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,880
Xbox Live Arcade, but the Steam version is

2143
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,880
Supposed to be coming out around

2144
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,880
April 28th

2145
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,880
And of course the PC version

2146
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,880
On Steam will be available for

2147
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,880
$17.99

2148
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,880
And uh, I guess that'll be

2149
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,880
If you pre-order it, otherwise

2150
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,880
It's going to be $20

2151
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,880
No word on exactly what it's going to cost of course

2152
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,880
On um

2153
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,880
Xbox Live Arcade, but probably somewhere around that

2154
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,880
I mean $15

2155
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,880
By the way, Rama in our chat room is clarifying

2156
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,880
Just in case you didn't know, Rocket Knight Adventures

2157
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,880
Was on the Sega Genesis

2158
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,880
And the sequel Sparkster was on the

2159
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,880
Super Nintendo and Genesis

2160
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,880
So Sparkster was the original sequel

2161
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,880
There you go

2162
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,880
Alright, um, I got some other rapid

2163
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,880
Quick stories for you guys

2164
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,880
Couple items around Rock Band

2165
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,880
Of course the weekly Rock Band releases

2166
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,880
The songs that are coming out on Rock Band this week

2167
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,880
Either on the 13th or the 15th

2168
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,880
Depending on what system you're on

2169
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,880
The Used will be releasing

2170
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,880
The songs Blood on My Hands, Born to Quit

2171
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,880
And The Taste of Ink

2172
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,880
And some individual tracks from Surge Tunkian

2173
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,880
Empty Walls and Sky is Over

2174
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,880
As well as All Star

2175
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,880
By Smash Mouth

2176
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,880
If you haven't heard that song

2177
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,880
500 times in 1999

2178
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,880
You can hear it all over again

2179
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,880
Speaking of 90's terrific things

2180
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,880
Green Day is coming out

2181
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,880
Of course with their own version of Rock Band

2182
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,880
I did take a look at it a little bit

2183
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,880
At PAX East, I didn't get to play it

2184
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,880
But I saw other people playing it

2185
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,880
And it definitely looked like the Beatles engine

2186
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,880
But now they've replaced the Beatles with

2187
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,880
You know, the punk guys of Green Day

2188
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,880
So, you know, and giving it its own little spice

2189
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,880
Obviously, the songs that will be in the game

2190
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,880
I'm not gonna name them all, but I will just say

2191
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,880
It almost looks like most of the

2192
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,880
Dookie album, American Idiot

2193
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,880
And 21st Century

2194
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,880
Breakdown, almost like all those

2195
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,880
Albums seem to be there, I mean there are some tracks missing

2196
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,880
But big, big components of those albums

2197
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,880
Otherwise, from

2198
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,880
Warning, there's Minority and Warning

2199
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,880
Nimrod has Hitchin' a Ride, Good Riddance, Time of Your Life

2200
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,880
You know, when you need that slow jam

2201
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,880
That quintessential goodbye song

2202
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,880
Nice Guys Finish Last, then Insomniac has

2203
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,880
Brain Stew, Jaded, and Geek Stink Breath

2204
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,880
Geek Stink Breath

2205
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,880
Downloadable content includes 21

2206
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,880
Guns, and so forth

2207
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,880
A few songs there

2208
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,880
And then lastly for you guys, Squeenix

2209
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,880
Has some Final Fantasy XIV updates this week

2210
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,880
Including some of the races and clan

2211
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,880
Information

2212
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,880
Basically, your races can boil down into these

2213
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,880
Different clans, so

2214
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,880
You can play one of the not-Galka

2215
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,880
But they're actually called Rogadins now

2216
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,880
You can actually be like a

2217
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,880
Sea Wolf Fisherman type of

2218
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,880
Galka, I keep on calling them Galkas

2219
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,880
But I guess they're Rogadins now

2220
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,880
Or you can be like a fire type

2221
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,880
Hellsguard clan, so it's like all the

2222
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,880
Races now have clans too

2223
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,880
So you have like a specialized sort of

2224
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,880
Place that your race comes from

2225
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,880
Well I'm glad they actually changed something other than the names

2226
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,880
Well here's the other big thing is that

2227
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,880
Some more information came out that's out there on the internet

2228
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,880
And your characters have like first and

2229
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,880
Last names now

2230
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,880
A lot of instances play into

2231
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,880
The game apparently

2232
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,880
Where you get a lot of your own copy of the world

2233
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,880
Dude, the game is sounding more and more like

2234
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,880
Final Fantasy XI meets not Warcraft

2235
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,880
But Guild Wars

2236
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,880
Like I seriously think the game that they're making

2237
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,880
Is like Final Fantasy XIV Guild Wars

2238
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,880
Okay, that sounds playable

2239
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,880
Just make it so I don't have to pay an online fee

2240
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,880
Like Guild Wars and I'm there

2241
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,880
Sadly I don't think that part, but there's screens from the alpha

2242
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,880
That are leaking out there now and you can see

2243
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,880
I'll have to show you the website here in Studio Loki

2244
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,880
And Jamie if you want to see it too

2245
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,880
Because your items are on like

2246
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,880
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, like you push the button

2247
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,880
To do the attack now

2248
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,880
Like it's a little more wow-ish

2249
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,880
Or Guild Wars was kind of the same way

2250
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,880
So very curious to see how this plays out

2251
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,880
Well as long as I can do it with a controller

2252
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,880
Because I kind of miss playing with a controller

2253
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,880
Well if they're developing it for PS3

2254
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,880
Then I'm sure controller will be

2255
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,880
I mean but it'll be weird because I don't know if you'll be able to

2256
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,880
Put in just any old controller or what you'll have to do

2257
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,880
Break out the old gravis pad, do it the old school way

2258
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,880
It should be fine

2259
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,880
We'll see what happens, more to come

2260
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,880
When the beta for that is released

2261
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,880
But meanwhile we just have stuff leaking out from the alpha

2262
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,880
So I'll show you, while Jamie does her quick stories here

2263
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,880
I'll pull up that website

2264
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,880
That somebody texted me here in Studio

2265
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,880
And show you guys the screenshots

2266
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,880
And I'll post it in chat if anyone actually cares

2267
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,880
Well some kid

2268
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,880
Who is on Facebook

2269
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,880
Plays Farmville

2270
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,880
And used

2271
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,880
Their parent's

2272
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,880
Credit card to run up a

2273
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,880
905 pound tab

2274
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,880
Basically

2275
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,880
About $13-1400

2276
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,880
To

2277
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,880
Pay for stuff

2278
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,880
I guess he took his

2279
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,880
Mother's credit card and put it in

2280
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,880
And

2281
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,880
Spent all that money

2282
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,880
So they're trying to figure something out on it

2283
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,880
I guess, I just think

2284
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,880
I hate Farmville anyway

2285
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,880
It's a waste of time

2286
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,880
I know people like it, they want to do it fine

2287
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,880
But if you got kids that play it, watch out for your

2288
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,880
Credit card

2289
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,880
Can I just interject something real quick

2290
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,880
I know you don't watch a lot of TV

2291
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,880
But this week South Park was awesome

2292
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,880
Because they made fun of

2293
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,880
Oh here's the screenshots of 14 by the way

2294
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,880
You can kind of see with the little stuff at the bottom

2295
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,880
Yeah it's very pretty looking

2296
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,880
The Vulture 8 is dead ass up

2297
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,880
You can see there

2298
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,880
Just some people running around the world

2299
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,880
It looks very pretty

2300
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,880
South Park did a Facebook

2301
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,880
Related episode this week and it was hilarious

2302
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,880
But it was Facebook

2303
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,880
For the first half and then it was Tron for the second half

2304
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,880
Yeah I need to watch that one

2305
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,880
It was pretty fucking funny I gotta say

2306
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,880
So was it Face Tron?

2307
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,880
Well it was one of those things where I gotta be honest

2308
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,880
A lot of episodes of South Park have been like this lately

2309
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,880
The first 15 minutes are

2310
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,880
Really fucking funny when they're parodying

2311
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,880
Something and they're doing it well

2312
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,880
And then they decide to go this really like

2313
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,880
ETF lol BBQ direction

2314
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,880
For the last 15 minutes

2315
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,880
That doesn't work so much

2316
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,880
Like that's been kind of a pattern of South Park lately

2317
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,880
Like the first 15 minutes are hilarious

2318
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,880
And the second 15 minutes are not nearly as funny

2319
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,880
And that's kind of sadly the Tron part

2320
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,880
Not as funny as the rest of it

2321
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,880
But I thought it was awesome they referenced it

2322
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,880
I love Tron though

2323
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,880
Namco Bandai is doing something really

2324
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,880
Neat

2325
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,880
We're getting Splatterhouse on

2326
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,880
I guess they're doing

2327
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,880
They're doing a new game

2328
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,880
They got delayed and delayed

2329
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,880
I was saying that

2330
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,880
Sorry

2331
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,880
Okay

2332
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,880
As I was trying to say

2333
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,880
They're doing a new Splatterhouse

2334
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,880
And they're gonna put the original

2335
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
Trilogy on

2336
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,880
The disc

2337
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,880
I guess this is a little fun compilation

2338
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,880
To add on to that

2339
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,880
It will have the original

2340
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,880
Arcade version of Splatterhouse

2341
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,880
As in the uncensored one

2342
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,880
And then Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3

2343
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,880
That were the Genesis versions

2344
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,880
So

2345
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,880
That'll be pretty fun

2346
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,880
Was this Herpographics one censored as well?

2347
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,880
Cause I remember that being pretty

2348
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,880
I have it but I haven't

2349
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,880
Played it in so long that

2350
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,880
I'd have to break it out and see

2351
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,880
I don't recall it

2352
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,880
Really being that censored

2353
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,880
Really

2354
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,880
And then

2355
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,880
And then we have

2356
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,880
For Xbox Live in April

2357
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,880
Final Fight and Mega Man 10

2358
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,880
Download Content

2359
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,880
Basically

2360
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,880
It's Final Fight Double Impact

2361
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,880
And

2362
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,880
That's gonna be on April 14th

2363
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,880
And then

2364
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,880
There will be

2365
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,880
The Mall half-priced

2366
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,880
On April 12th

2367
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,880
And then two add-ons for Mega Man 10

2368
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,880
Which is Base and Special Stage 1

2369
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,880
Also known as Forte

2370
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,880
Final Fight Double Impact

2371
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,880
Next week

2372
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,880
Or as I call it, Magic Sword

2373
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,880
And some other little game

2374
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,880
That I remember from a pizza parlor

2375
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,880
I know I'm excited

2376
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,880
There was no Xbox Live Arcade release this week

2377
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,880
I don't think there was

2378
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,880
And they tend to do that after their big huge

2379
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,880
Promotions, then they go

2380
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,880
Oh we just had this awesome promotion

2381
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,880
And some old games on sale

2382
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,880
But we just want to overlook that we have no new game this week

2383
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,880
There's no new game this week

2384
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,880
Because they're too busy shutting down

2385
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,880
Xbox service

2386
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,880
On April 15th

2387
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,880
It's gone, it's out there

2388
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,880
So get your taxes done

2389
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,880
And get your last Halo 2 game in

2390
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,880
Unless you're gonna play on PC from here on out

2391
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,880
I hope we get a patch so we get our 100 plus friends now

2392
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,880
It's weird though

2393
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,880
Because they already had the big patch

2394
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,880
For the USB support

2395
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,880
This past week

2396
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,880
I don't know if you heard

2397
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,880
We were talking about it, I don't think we are

2398
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,880
But you heard that uncrippled the hard drive

2399
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,880
Set of consoles that got banned

2400
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,880
Oh?

2401
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,880
Yes, that patch did

2402
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,880
Interesting, yeah I think that is interesting

2403
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,880
Alright, I wanted to quickly

2404
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,880
Answer some questions from chat

2405
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,880
chat.orangewiseontraday.com

2406
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,880
Frisbee's asking in reference to the South Park episode

2407
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,880
What did you think about the chat roulette part?

2408
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,880
Oh I forgot that they make chat roulette

2409
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,880
I didn't even realize that was a real site

2410
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,880
I actually had the check that I was like, holy crap that's a real site

2411
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,880
The only way that I know that's a real site

2412
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,880
Is that I've seen the YouTube of the guy

2413
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,880
Well I've seen a couple YouTubes

2414
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,880
The guy that does the piano

2415
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,880
And starts singing the random songs

2416
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,880
To the guys that come up on there

2417
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,880
Which is really funny

2418
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,880
And then there was a guy who dressed up like Lady Gaga

2419
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,880
And did lip syncs

2420
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,880
But he was like a really hairy guy

2421
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,880
So it was really funny because it was obviously not a woman

2422
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,880
And just all the people reacting to him

2423
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,880
Was kind of funny

2424
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,880
But yeah, you're not gonna catch me

2425
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,880
I will die before I will go on chat roulette

2426
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,880
Like I've never been to the website

2427
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,880
Penis, penis, penis, penis

2428
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,880
I thought it was funny but it was kind of one of those things

2429
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,880
Where the joke got old

2430
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,880
And then they kept saying it like over and over again

2431
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,880
For like another three minutes

2432
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,880
And I was like, okay, I'm over it

2433
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,880
But yeah, chat roulette, not a site

2434
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,880
I mean god, I'm barely on AIM and Skype

2435
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,880
Why would I go on chat roulette and talk to strangers

2436
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,880
I can't even talk to my friends online

2437
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,880
I'm not gonna go on chat roulette

2438
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,880
Alright let's get to some Twitter topics

2439
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,880
Every week we let you guys ask questions on Twitter

2440
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,880
It seems like every podcast does this now

2441
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,880
I don't know, like I've been listening to more podcasts

2442
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,880
Everybody has a damn Twitter segment now

2443
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,880
I'd like to think we were one of the first

2444
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,880
It's like we were one of the first Skype shows

2445
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,880
But whatever

2446
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,880
It's awesome because it's our listeners

2447
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,880
And they ask some crazy asked questions sometimes

2448
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,880
And share some stories with us

2449
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,880
That we might otherwise miss on the show

2450
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,880
That's the other very important thing

2451
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,880
Retertainment asks, games to play while drunk

2452
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,880
Games to play while drunk

2453
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,880
And go

2454
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,880
I'd play DDR drunk

2455
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,880
Rock band if Jamie's party yesterday

2456
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,880
Was any indication

2457
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,880
I wasn't really drunk

2458
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,880
You weren't drunk

2459
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,880
Yeah any type of karaoke game

2460
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,880
Is always funnier when drunk

2461
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,880
Why are you aware of the Wii

2462
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,880
I think a lot of Wii games

2463
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,880
Are kind of funnier when you're drunk

2464
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,880
But just be careful

2465
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,880
There's a difference between funny and hurting yourself

2466
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,880
That goddamn unicorn game

2467
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,880
That Loki always fucking plays during the show

2468
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,880
I'm sure is better when you're drunk

2469
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,880
He's playing right now

2470
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,880
Robot unicorn attack, there you go

2471
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,880
Agdeft says Konami is distributing

2472
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,880
Latin American made game

2473
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,880
Lucha Libre AAA Heroes Del Ring

2474
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,880
In America

2475
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,880
Ironically it's not coming out in Mexico

2476
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,880
I don't know, maybe another developer is putting it out there

2477
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,880
I don't know, but if you like your

2478
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,880
Mexican wrestling, which it is kind of a niche thing

2479
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,880
But it's pretty cool

2480
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,880
Yeah and it's actual stars of AAA wrestling

2481
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,880
El Eligido

2482
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,880
Abismo Negro Psycho Clown

2483
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,880
Electroshock, and Charlie Manson

2484
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,880
There's a wrestler named Charlie Manson

2485
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,880
That's a little close to a certain

2486
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,880
Serial killer

2487
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,880
So there you go

2488
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,880
You might remember Konami

2489
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,880
This isn't the first time they put out wrestling games

2490
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,880
Oh no, they had Rumble Roses

2491
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,880
Remember Rumble Roses?

2492
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,880
What's your favorite Xbox game?

2493
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,880
I wanted to play that actually, it's a game that Dan would never pick up

2494
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,880
But I really wanted to play it

2495
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,880
You could probably get it now for like $3

2496
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,880
I think I saw Dead or Alive Volleyball

2497
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,880
Or whatever for like $10 the other day

2498
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,880
Hey, that was fun

2499
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,880
There's a game to play when drunk

2500
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,880
We've got to

2501
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,880
And yes, I've watched Dan play it while I was drunk

2502
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,880
Portal Drunk, instant throw up

2503
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,880
SSJ100Matt on his Twitter account says

2504
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,880
Not so much a story, but a question for Loki

2505
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,880
Are you paying attention Loki?

2506
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,880
He's playing the unicorn farting game

2507
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,880
Well he just crashed the unicorn, so here we go

2508
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,880
What's your opinion on the kid that was caught

2509
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,880
Trying to steal the game Breach at PAX East?

2510
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,880
Well it was a good attempt I guess

2511
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,880
But he got caught

2512
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,880
Don't compliment him

2513
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,880
Nice try kid

2514
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,880
He doesn't deserve a compliment

2515
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,880
It was a stupid asshole thing to do

2516
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,880
Yeah, well his reasons were retarded

2517
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,880
It's like, I just want to play this with my friend

2518
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,880
Well

2519
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,880
No, you wanted to brag that you had the game

2520
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,880
Is what you wanted to do

2521
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,880
And unfortunately you're stupid and you got caught

2522
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,880
So now you're going to face fines and jail time

2523
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,880
And all that stuff

2524
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,880
Hope it was worth it

2525
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,880
I'm going to say he probably shouldn't have done it in the first place

2526
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,880
Just taking a lucky stab in the dark

2527
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,880
Well he shouldn't have, but you know

2528
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,880
He wanted to make a name for himself

2529
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,880
It's kind of surprising that he had the balls to do it

2530
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,880
And then not show up to his court date

2531
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,880
That was pretty fun

2532
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,880
Hilarious

2533
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,880
He was too busy playing on Chat Roulette

2534
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,880
No, he was playing Modern Warfare 2

2535
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,880
Was he really?

2536
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,880
Spazinator, a PSN on Twitter

2537
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,880
Actually tells us

2538
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,880
Samurai Shodown 2 was also on Xbox Live Arcade

2539
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,880
It was released there last year

2540
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,880
That's right

2541
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,880
I don't remember if Jamie said it

2542
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,880
Sometimes people tweet us while she's doing that

2543
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,880
Yeah, I remember

2544
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,880
I played it for a little bit, but I got to admit

2545
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,880
I was not as big on Samurai Shodown

2546
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,880
I was talking about Samurai Shodown 2

2547
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,880
The one that was released on Xbox Live Arcade

2548
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,880
But that was not the series

2549
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,880
I was really as into on Neo Geo

2550
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,880
I was more of a Fatal Fury person

2551
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,880
I have Fatal Fury Special

2552
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,880
Then after that

2553
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,880
I would go with Art of Fighting

2554
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,880
Then maybe Samurai Shodown

2555
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,880
Because I like Katori Hanzo

2556
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,880
ActDeft says DJ Hero's price

2557
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,880
is now down to $50 at Toys R Us

2558
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,880
and links us to a new story about the price reduction

2559
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,880
Not surprised

2560
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,880
That didn't move as well as they did

2561
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,880
Now would be a good time to pick that up

2562
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,880
for DJ Hero 2

2563
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,880
If you want to get the controller

2564
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,880
and have it for DJ Hero 2

2565
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,880
They also have, if you really want to spend the money

2566
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,880
They have these new bundles now that have two

2567
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,880
DJ Hero controllers with the game

2568
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,880
It's a good game

2569
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,880
It's a bummer they didn't support the download content better

2570
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,880
Because they could have done better

2571
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,880
I'll pick up the sequel

2572
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,880
Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome game

2573
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,880
It's just typical

2574
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,880
of Activision and their support

2575
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,880
for the download content

2576
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,880
If you've seen what they do for the Guitar Hero series

2577
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,880
It's not a big surprise that we only have

2578
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,880
three pieces of download content

2579
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,880
Dark Tetsuya says

2580
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,880
I just realized we haven't heard from the ferret in a while

2581
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,880
What ever happened to him?

2582
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,880
When we moved the show to Studio Dark Sakura

2583
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,880
The ferret didn't really come with us

2584
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,880
I found it while moving

2585
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,880
So the ferret is at my place right now

2586
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,880
Don't forget we have other mascots here

2587
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,880
We have that stupid Dalek

2588
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,880
That I don't think is funny at all

2589
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,880
We also have Shirmi

2590
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,880
Who makes a pretty awesome mascot

2591
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,880
Remember, Shirmi shit on the floor

2592
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,880
When we were talking about that PlayStation show The Tester

2593
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,880
Well good, I'm glad

2594
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,880
But that was her opinion, she was critiquing

2595
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,880
Wait wait wait

2596
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,880
Ferret was, oh god my ears

2597
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,880
Ferret was better

2598
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,880
Ferret or Dalek?

2599
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,880
I say ferret

2600
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,880
Ray Ayanami says

2601
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,880
No I'm sorry I skipped one

2602
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,880
Spaznator also sent, usually I don't do two tweets

2603
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,880
But I will allow it tonight

2604
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,880
Rob you asked about a month ago if I seen The Tester

2605
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,880
Finally seen it, I have similar thoughts on it

2606
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,880
You know I stopped watching it

2607
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,880
I heard it ended finally

2608
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,880
And I'm pretty sure

2609
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,880
Season 1 ended

2610
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,880
Oh god are they doing another one?

2611
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,880
Well anyhow I'm pretty sure the person I thought

2612
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,880
Was gonna win won

2613
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,880
You know I would go on season 2 of The Tester

2614
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,880
Why not?

2615
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,880
I mean they probably tape it over a weekend

2616
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,880
And you get $5,000 for winning

2617
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,880
I mean I probably wouldn't keep the job

2618
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,880
But I'd like to have the $5,000

2619
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,880
That'd be pretty awesome

2620
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,880
It might be a fame whore, why not?

2621
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,880
That even won The Tester, what do you think?

2622
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,880
Go Xbox

2623
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,880
I don't know, I quit

2624
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,880
Might be fun for the experience

2625
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,880
It sucks, I don't wanna play Ipet

2626
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,880
Alright Ray Ayanami says

2627
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,880
Oh whoops that was a personal tweet here

2628
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,880
Just it had at o-l-r in it here

2629
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,880
Shadow Sniper says your thoughts on Hitman 5

2630
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,880
And what you would like to see in the new game

2631
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,880
There's a Hitman 5?

2632
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,880
I didn't even know there was a Hitman 5 coming out

2633
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,880
I didn't play Hitman 1 through 4

2634
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,880
It's not really my type of game, Loki that's more of your alley

2635
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,880
No, it's a stealth

2636
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,880
Action game so that's not really

2637
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,880
My forte

2638
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,880
What would I like to see in the new game? Lots of sex and violence

2639
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,880
That always makes for a great video game, right?

2640
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,880
Not Timothy Orphan, whatever his name is

2641
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,880
Yes and more lesbians

2642
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,880
Tigerclaw305

2643
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,880
Tweet says

2644
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,880
GTA is being shown to school children to teach them

2645
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,880
About violence and links us to this

2646
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,880
News story here from vg247.com

2647
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,880
That

2648
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,880
Apparently great school children

2649
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,880
Are shown imagery from Grand Theft Auto

2650
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,880
It's in the UK

2651
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,880
And they're showing it to children between 9 and 11

2652
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,880
And they're trying to keep them from being

2653
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,880
Desensitized to violent behavior

2654
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,880
And teach them consequences

2655
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,880
By the way they also show them

2656
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,880
The Itchy and Scratchy show from the Simpsons

2657
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,880
What?

2658
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,880
Like I had to check to make sure this wasn't dated April 1st

2659
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,880
What?

2660
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,880
Fight, and fight, and fight, and fight, and fight

2661
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,880
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

2662
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,880
Just a guess but

2663
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,880
I don't think you show people violence to get them

2664
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,880
Not desensitized to violence

2665
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,880
That kind of

2666
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,880
Is, you know, the opposite of what you want to do

2667
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,880
You know what they did when I was young to scare the shit out of me

2668
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,880
And this wasn't necessarily about violence

2669
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,880
But it was violent

2670
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,880
And it was about the responsibility of having a driver's license

2671
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,880
Is they'd show us red asphalt

2672
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,880
Oh we laughed through that

2673
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,880
That's, you're not supposed to laugh

2674
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,880
It's disgusting

2675
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,880
I actually don't think I've ever seen red asphalt

2676
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,880
I would like not watch it

2677
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,880
Like I just would kind of look away and not really watch it

2678
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,880
It was disgusting

2679
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,880
Remember that every 15 minutes, you know, they'll teach you about drunk driving

2680
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,880
I'm like, you're wasting so much time

2681
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,880
I don't care

2682
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,880
I get it

2683
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,880
This person had alcohol

2684
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,880
This is a drunk driving accident

2685
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,880
It's sad, it happens

2686
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,880
Why do I have to sit here for two hours while you talk about it?

2687
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,880
They didn't do that at my school

2688
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,880
Did they actually drink?

2689
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,880
No they didn't, here's what they did

2690
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,880
This is great

2691
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,880
And this is from how I understand that they did it

2692
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,880
It could be a little different

2693
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,880
Okay, first they came out on our

2694
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,880
You know, our football field

2695
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,880
Because we had our stadium and whatever

2696
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,880
They had everybody sit there and they had this

2697
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,880
Big thing covered up with a tarp or something

2698
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,880
So they pulled the tarp off

2699
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,880
And it's this horrible car accident

2700
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,880
Like this person mangled or whatever

2701
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,880
Of course it's just a person with makeup on and whatnot

2702
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,880
And then an ambulance comes

2703
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,880
And they realistically

2704
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,880
Pull them out of the wreckage and stuff like that

2705
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,880
And then

2706
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,880
Later on

2707
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,880
Was it like one of the students?

2708
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,880
Yeah, it was one of the students

2709
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,880
It was somebody, animal

2710
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,880
And then later on they had this grim reaper

2711
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,880
Walking around the entire day

2712
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,880
And in 15 minutes they would take a student

2713
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,880
And pull them out of class

2714
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,880
And they were basically dead

2715
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,880
And they wouldn't be there for the rest of the week

2716
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,880
Or however long it was

2717
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,880
You had to get out of school for a week?

2718
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,880
Okay, but no

2719
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,880
It's like punishment basically

2720
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,880
And I don't know if

2721
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,880
Wait, punishment?

2722
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,880
What did you do to get the grim reaper to tap you?

2723
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,880
Oh, Matt didn't do his homework, you come with me

2724
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,880
Kid

2725
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,880
You're a drunk driver

2726
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,880
This is entirely accurate because

2727
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,880
It's really fucked up if it is

2728
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,880
Um, basically they took

2729
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,880
Them to like some sort of location

2730
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,880
A cabin or whatever

2731
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,880
And made them write notes to their parents or something like that

2732
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,880
About like

2733
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,880
Dear mom, I am dead

2734
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,880
I died at school today

2735
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,880
Hello dad, I'm in hell!

2736
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,880
Basically they said that they told their parents that they died

2737
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,880
Or something like that

2738
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,880
That's a horrible thing to do to your parents

2739
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,880
Can you imagine if I wrote

2740
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,880
I had to write a letter to my mom

2741
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,880
Hi mom, I died at school today

2742
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,880
The grim reaper took me out of class because I drank a drug

2743
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,880
They didn't

2744
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,880
They wrote letters to their parents later on

2745
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,880
About stuff like that

2746
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,880
Apparently the impression I was under

2747
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,880
Is that the

2748
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,880
The police went to their house

2749
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,880
And told their parents that they were dead

2750
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,880
You know

2751
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,880
Shouldn't they be out trying to catch

2752
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,880
Real drunk drivers?

2753
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,880
Anyways, you know what they did at my school?

2754
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,880
They would have the really mean, fugly PE teacher

2755
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,880
Come in and say

2756
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,880
If you drink and drive

2757
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,880
You're gonna go to jail

2758
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,880
And you're gonna stay there forever

2759
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,880
And you're gonna have a criminal record

2760
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,880
And if you drink and drive, you're an idiot

2761
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,880
It took five minutes

2762
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,880
I understand that and that makes perfect sense

2763
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,880
Not only did we have to sit through this two hour long

2764
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,880
You know

2765
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,880
Accident thing

2766
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,880
And them talking about

2767
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,880
Every fifteen minutes and stuff

2768
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,880
For another assembly

2769
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,880
Where these people were crying

2770
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,880
Their parents were crying, I thought Billy was dead

2771
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,880
And all this stuff

2772
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,880
It was annoying

2773
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,880
So that's why I've learned about drunk driving

2774
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,880
Is that it's absolutely annoying

2775
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,880
The crap you have to deal with if you do it

2776
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,880
So, don't do it

2777
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,880
Because you'll get two assemblies that you'll have to sit through

2778
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,880
No, but honestly though

2779
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,880
I mean, duh

2780
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,880
Drunk driving impairs you and you can die

2781
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,880
Okay, or kill somebody

2782
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,880
I mean, any sane person

2783
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,880
That has some sort of common sense

2784
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,880
Gets that

2785
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,880
However, nowadays, kids are not being raised with common sense

2786
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,880
So, it's no wonder that they have to have

2787
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,880
Multiple assemblies

2788
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,880
In order for this to sink in

2789
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,880
And even then, it's just not going to

2790
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,880
Well that's okay, I'm just gonna

2791
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,880
Smoke pot instead

2792
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,880
That's better

2793
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,880
I'm not drinking and driving at all

2794
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,880
Fuck you, Grim Reaper

2795
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,880
What were we talking about before?

2796
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,880
I don't remember

2797
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,880
I was trying to see if they had that clip

2798
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,880
That I remember from the 90s

2799
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,880
That was, uh

2800
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,880
Yeah, I think it's this

2801
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,880
This was very much like what they did at my school

2802
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,880
I think it's this clip

2803
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,880
So, Beavis and Butthead

2804
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,880
I understand Mr. McVicar has made

2805
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,880
A little arrangement with you guys

2806
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,880
Yeah, a little probation

2807
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,880
You see, class Beavis and Butthead

2808
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,880
Here are not allowed to laugh

2809
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,880
For a whole week

2810
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,880
That's right, and if they do laugh

2811
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,880
They'll be expelled and they'll have to

2812
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,880
Go to Hope High School where they'll get

2813
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,880
Their asses kicked on a daily basis

2814
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,880
By all the other delinquents

2815
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,880
Yeah, okay, so

2816
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,880
Well, I was real glad to hear that

2817
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,880
Because this is Sex Education Week

2818
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,880
Oh, here we go

2819
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,880
That's right, Sex Ed Week

2820
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,880
We're gonna be talking about the penis

2821
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,880
We'll be talking about

2822
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,880
The vagina

2823
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,880
Do you think that's funny, Butthead?

2824
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,880
Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking

2825
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,880
About the testicles?

2826
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,880
Yes, we're also gonna be talking

2827
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,880
About venereal disease

2828
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,880
Sexual intercourse

2829
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,880
And we will definitely

2830
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,880
Be spending a lot of time

2831
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,880
Talking about masturbation

2832
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,880
Laughing

2833
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,880
Laughing

2834
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,880
That's what they did at my school

2835
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,880
See, this is the type of letter

2836
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,880
Actually, that they had to write

2837
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,880
For the every 15 minutes program

2838
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,880
Dear Mom and Dad, every 15 minutes someone dies

2839
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,880
As a result of an alcohol related collision

2840
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,880
Today I died and I never got the chance

2841
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,880
To tell you blah blah blah

2842
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,880
And that's what made them all upset

2843
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,880
It was annoying, trust me

2844
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,880
If you go through high school

2845
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,880
Just get the gym teacher in there for five minutes

2846
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,880
Scare the hell out of everyone

2847
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,880
Do you want to see me again?

2848
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,880
Do you want to see me again?

2849
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,880
We have some other tweets

2850
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,880
MNZeba

2851
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,880
Follows that with a question about Pokemon

2852
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,880
RO

2853
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,880
Plugging the old

2854
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,880
Pokemon RO telling us

2855
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,880
That you can actually win a beta account

2856
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,880
Apparently they're doing a little thing there

2857
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,880
But the thing they linked us to didn't work

2858
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,880
But here's my thing

2859
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,880
For some reason the link didn't work

2860
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,880
But here's my question about Pokemon RO

2861
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,880
Didn't one of these Pokemon operations get shut down recently?

2862
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,880
Like there was a Pokemon MMO going on?

2863
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,880
Like I'm just saying

2864
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,880
I hope it doesn't get shut down

2865
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,880
I wouldn't like to see that happen to this

2866
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,880
But I'm just saying if Nintendo did the other one

2867
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,880
Just be careful kids

2868
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,880
I've seen some of the in-game stuff

2869
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,880
That looks pretty

2870
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,880
Ragnarok-y, pretty good

2871
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,880
Alright anyhow

2872
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,880
That's it for Twitter topics tonight

2873
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,880
Thank you guys so much for the tweets

2874
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,880
And sorry I didn't get to everything

2875
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,880
Well we had to play the clip from Beavis and Butthead

2876
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,880
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us in the future

2877
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,880
Alright Giovedea in our chatroom says

2878
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,880
I took a college class where we had to yell

2879
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,880
tits, ass, penis, vagina, and all that

2880
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,880
on the first day of class

2881
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,880
Sex education in college is actually a lot of fun

2882
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,880
And it's educational

2883
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,880
So those of you kids that are about the college age

2884
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,880
Just take it, it's fun

2885
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,880
We actually had in our class

2886
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,880
They brought a transsexual

2887
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,880
person in one day

2888
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,880
Not a transvestite

2889
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,880
We actually had to learn the difference

2890
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,880
Transvestite is someone who just dresses

2891
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,880
for fun and you know for

2892
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,880
whatever

2893
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,880
And a transsexual is someone who believes they are

2894
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,880
the other gender

2895
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:32,880
and is the ones that actually get the operations

2896
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,880
So they had a transsexual come in

2897
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,880
Teacher shut the door and said, okay for the next hour you can ask

2898
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,880
anything you want and this person has agreed to

2899
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,880
answer any gross

2900
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,880
curiosity, whatever you've ever wanted to know

2901
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,880
now's time to ask it

2902
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,880
So they asked everything

2903
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,880
Everything

2904
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,880
But it was a highly educational day, I'll tell you that

2905
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,880
Our 6th

2906
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,880
grade sex ed

2907
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,880
was hilarious because they didn't really have

2908
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,880
We had a female teacher so the female teacher

2909
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,880
took the girls and explained the girls stuff

2910
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,880
And then apparently

2911
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,880
some kid's father

2912
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,880
was the person we had

2913
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,880
teaching the male portion of it and the guy

2914
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,880
was a pervert

2915
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,880
And that was funny

2916
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,880
Yeah they used to split up the class for us too

2917
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,880
And then the teacher found out

2918
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,880
the guy was a pervert

2919
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,880
And that was the end of sex ed

2920
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,880
You guys might find this

2921
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,880
funny but when I was in sex ed

2922
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,880
You know what test I did

2923
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,880
We had like 6 different tests throughout class

2924
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,880
Do you know which test I got the lowest score on?

2925
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,880
Out of all the tests that they gave out in class?

2926
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,880
Male anatomy? No

2927
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,880
Vagina week

2928
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,880
You'd find that funny

2929
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,880
I thought y'all would get a kick out of that

2930
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,880
I find that ironic

2931
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,880
Hey gaming

2932
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,880
news once in a while

2933
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,880
It happens

2934
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,880
believe it or not we talk about

2935
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,880
video game news on this program

2936
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,880
Oh god what happened to this show

2937
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,880
Loki?

2938
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,880
So what's kind of neat is there's a rumor

2939
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,880
that Microsoft's live support

2940
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,880
is coming to the free games that you get

2941
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,880
with Windows. Yes you may remember

2942
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,880
all those wonderful classics as

2943
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,880
Solitaire, Minesweeper,

2944
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,880
Chess, etc. Some of these

2945
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,880
I have never heard of I guess because I don't have

2946
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,880
Windows 7 like Purple Place

2947
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,880
Purple Place! Yeah it's one of the new

2948
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,880
Windows 7 games

2949
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,880
And Windows has Mahjong now?

2950
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,880
Yep

2951
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,880
It's on Vista

2952
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,880
It's on Vista and 7

2953
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,880
It's basically the old Shanghai game but

2954
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,880
you know now Microsoft brand

2955
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,880
So I wonder if

2956
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,880
that means

2957
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,880
apparently they're gonna not only get achievements

2958
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,880
but chat and leaderboard support

2959
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,880
So now I can chat with people

2960
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,880
while playing Solitaire and have leaderboards

2961
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,880
Wow

2962
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,880
Interesting that they're gonna integrate this

2963
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,880
Well you know Solitaire is a huge game

2964
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,880
on Windows I mean it's probably the number

2965
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,880
one Windows game above

2966
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,880
anything else you can think of

2967
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,880
WoW, Halo

2968
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,880
anything you can think of

2969
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,880
Solitaire is probably a bigger game then

2970
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,880
Yeah

2971
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,880
So I mean if you want to and probably Minesweeper

2972
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,880
to some extent too so if you want to enable people

2973
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,880
so to speak or get them on board early

2974
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,880
I suppose this is the way to do it

2975
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,880
It just seems, I don't know, a little weird

2976
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,880
But that's gonna be kind of interesting if I can

2977
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,880
further inflate my E-peen

2978
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,880
score with the

2979
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,880
you know

2980
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,880
Should have been working now, achievement

2981
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,880
Played Solitaire between

2982
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,880
the hours of 8am and 5pm, achievement

2983
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,880
unlocked

2984
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,880
Anyhow

2985
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:36,880
Microsoft of course isn't the only one

2986
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,880
that has a gaming network that is continuing

2987
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,880
to grow and develop but another

2988
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,880
big company is launching their own game network

2989
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,880
It's Apple, that's right

2990
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,880
One of the big things that was announced as part of the new

2991
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,880
iPhone 4.0 OS

2992
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,880
is Game Center

2993
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,880
Game Center is going to be a single

2994
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,880
online gaming experience

2995
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,880
for the Apple devices

2996
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,880
that will kind of link all these games together

2997
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,880
You'll be able to invite and track friends

2998
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,880
You'll have matchmaking with this, leaderboards

2999
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,880
and achievements, that's right

3000
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,880
it's very own achievements

3001
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,880
What's kind of interesting about this

3002
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,880
is that systems like this already exist

3003
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,880
somewhat in Apple's world

3004
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,880
I don't know if any of you guys grabbed the

3005
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,880
Commodore 64 emulator

3006
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,880
that's available on the Apple, it was free a couple

3007
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,880
days ago, I think just for like last

3008
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,880
weekend, so I grabbed it

3009
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,880
It uses a technology called OpenFaint

3010
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,880
which I believe is by the people who made Aurora

3011
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,880
faint, which was one of the

3012
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,880
very early early iPhone games that was

3013
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,880
out there, that was the same type of thing

3014
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,880
Somebody to develop like this platform

3015
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,880
Well what happened is that now you have

3016
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,880
OpenFaint and you have these other competing

3017
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,880
platforms as well, and so

3018
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,880
Apple has finally just decided to step in and say

3019
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,880
you know what, actually, I think

3020
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,880
we're going to do our own thing

3021
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,880
Not just to steal a good idea

3022
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,880
but I think to kind of

3023
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,880
they probably see what's happening with the developers

3024
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,880
and that more and more game developers want to be on OpenFaint

3025
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,880
or something like this, so Apple probably just

3026
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,880
wants to standardize it across the board

3027
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,880
and have ownership of it

3028
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,880
It affects their branding

3029
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,880
I think, so

3030
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,880
Yeah, and as much as you want to kind of say

3031
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,880
they're big and evil for wanting to basically

3032
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,880
shut down OpenFaint, well they're not really shutting down

3033
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,880
OpenFaint, but they're really

3034
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,880
trying to render it irrelevant, although

3035
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,880
I'm sure OpenFaint will still be around for some things

3036
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,880
I think Apple is very

3037
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,880
big on consistency

3038
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,880
Hence why they have such a rigid review

3039
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,880
thing for apps

3040
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,880
You know, there's a reason why your apps

3041
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,880
all kind of look and feel the same

3042
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,880
It's because it's not like you get to make

3043
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,880
whatever buttons you want

3044
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,880
There are limitations to what you get to do with apps

3045
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,880
And I think it's to give consistency

3046
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,880
And so I think Apple

3047
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,880
wants to take kind of reign of this

3048
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,880
to bring that same consistency because it works well

3049
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,880
for them

3050
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,880
But of course there's always that controversy

3051
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,880
because they don't really publish a lot of those guidelines

3052
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,880
on what exactly they look for when they screen things

3053
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,880
Yeah

3054
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,880
By the way, some other things that were announced that will affect

3055
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,880
gamers on the iPhone, I mean obviously

3056
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,880
there's multitasking was the big thing, although

3057
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,880
I got a 3G, so I'm

3058
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,880
screwed on that one, I'm not gonna get that

3059
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,880
Hopefully they announce a new iPhone in June

3060
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,880
because I'm eligible for an upgrade in October

3061
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,880
It works for the 3GS

3062
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,880
It will work for the 3GS, but I wanna

3063
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,880
I know Apple, there will be another

3064
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,880
newer, nicer iPhone within

3065
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,880
the year, so I gotta hold out

3066
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,880
for that

3067
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,880
They've got that in common with Nintendo, don't they?

3068
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,880
So, yeah

3069
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,880
I really, really, really wanna get an iPad

3070
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,880
because I'm a big fucking sheep

3071
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,880
But I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait till next year

3072
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,880
because I just know that camera

3073
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,880
on the front will be on next year's iPad

3074
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,880
Well, Dan and I were actually

3075
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,880
talking about how we both want

3076
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,880
one, but we're specifically gonna

3077
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,880
wait until another generation

3078
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,880
goes by

3079
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,880
And then we're

3080
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,880
probably gonna get them

3081
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,880
Also, by the way, just so you know,

3082
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,880
not just the multitasking, voice over

3083
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,880
IP in the background, like you can have Skype

3084
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,880
running and get calls on Skype, it's pretty neat

3085
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,880
And, again, no, not on 3G

3086
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,880
And folders to

3087
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,880
organize your stuff better, which

3088
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,880
is actually really helpful

3089
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,880
See, I think a lot of what they're incorporating, though, is stuff that they've actually stolen

3090
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,880
from the jailbreakers

3091
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,880
Yeah, I'm not surprised

3092
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,880
My friend's got a jailbroken iPhone, and

3093
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,880
it's got folders and all kinds of stuff with it

3094
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,880
and he can use it as a storage device

3095
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,880
and it's kinda crazy

3096
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:18,880
And what was the other one?

3097
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,880
Oh, ads, the iAds, now they're gonna

3098
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,880
have, Apple's gonna have its own ad platform

3099
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,880
because I guess they just didn't like AdMob

3100
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,880
No, it's not that they didn't like it

3101
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,880
They wanted a piece of it, but no flash

3102
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,880
Also, it's very

3103
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,880
interesting, I don't want to get too techy on you guys

3104
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,880
but it's very interesting how Apple is

3105
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,880
kind of kicking down Adobe

3106
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,880
and they're also kicking down Google

3107
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,880
Like, did you know that they are taking out

3108
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,880
I mean, you still will be able to

3109
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,880
search on the new

3110
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,880
iPhone 4.0 OS and you can use

3111
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,880
Google as a search engine, but the button

3112
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,880
will not say, like it says Google

3113
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,880
right now, it doesn't say anything else

3114
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,880
But they're opening it up for you to use Bing

3115
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,880
Yahoo, whatever

3116
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,880
That sounds pretty cool

3117
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,880
I guess

3118
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,880
I do like the stuff that's coming

3119
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,880
with the 4.0 OS, you know, I'm a little bummed

3120
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,880
that it won't work on my phone, but at the same time

3121
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,880
I'm getting a little irritated with my phone

3122
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,880
It locks up, it's slow

3123
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,880
I don't know, I might need to wipe it

3124
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,880
and reinstall everything, I don't know what the hell is

3125
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,880
making it run so crappy

3126
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,880
But yet, here I am, still a sheet, but I will

3127
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,880
Could it be the Apple created CPU inside

3128
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,880
of it?

3129
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,880
No?

3130
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,880
I might have all these problems, but at the end

3131
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,880
of the day, dang, I'll tell you, I use my

3132
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:30,880
iPhone so freaking much

3133
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,880
It's a great little device to have in my pocket

3134
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,880
I will say that

3135
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,880
Anyhow, let's move on, something non-Apple

3136
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,880
related, Dark Sakura

3137
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,880
Well, there are some pretty big Final Fantasy

3138
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,880
fans out and about

3139
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,880
And there's one person who's doing a very

3140
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,880
interesting translation of it

3141
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,880
They are doing Final Fantasy in

3142
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,880
um, Latin

3143
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,880
Yeah

3144
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,880
Um, it's of course

3145
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,880
going to be a ROM with a patch, but it's

3146
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,880
in Latin

3147
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,880
Okay

3148
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:02,880
That's hardcore

3149
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,880
It just makes me think of Eddie

3150
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,880
as they're talking about being mugged

3151
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,880
and saying something to them in Latin, going

3152
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,880
Oh no, he knows Latin, run!

3153
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,880
But I like the little

3154
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,880
line that uh

3155
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,880
Excuse me

3156
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,880
I must be allergic to Latin

3157
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,880
Um, that Destructoid has in their

3158
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,880
little article about it, it says, now can I get a copy

3159
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,880
of Alundra in Esperanto?

3160
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,880
Nice

3161
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,880
Isn't Esperanto like a

3162
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,880
completely made up language, like it's not something

3163
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,880
that is like It was meant to be a universal

3164
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,880
language, so it takes elements from different

3165
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,880
I see And actually

3166
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,880
it's, I'll tell you what Rob, you

3167
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,880
can look right now at a page in Esperanto

3168
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,880
and get an idea of what they're talking

3169
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,880
about I see, because it derives

3170
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,880
a little bit from every language Exactly

3171
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,880
Well that's kind of neat And I know people who are

3172
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,880
learning it, so That's cool It sounds

3173
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,880
cool I had a friend that spoke

3174
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,880
it actually, it was interesting to hear

3175
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:56,880
I want to call her

3176
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,880
in Esperanto

3177
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,880
I do not, because I have to

3178
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,880
talk to the call, Jamie if somebody calls

3179
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,880
in Esperanto, you're talking to him

3180
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,880
Uh, see

3181
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,880
See, no

3182
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,880
Anyhow

3183
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,880
Loki

3184
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,880
Something in English please

3185
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,880
Uh, yes, Fear 3

3186
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,880
has been announced, coming from

3187
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,880
Warner Brothers, and

3188
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,880
what's kind of neat about the new

3189
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,880
franchise in this horror

3190
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,880
shooter game, is actually

3191
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,880
it's going to be

3192
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,880
including cinematics created by

3193
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,880
John Carpenter

3194
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,880
The legendary horror

3195
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,880
master himself

3196
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:38,880
What's also cool, they're going to be having

3197
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,880
the writer Steve Niles working

3198
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,880
on it as well, he co-wrote

3199
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,880
the script I guess, for the game with

3200
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,880
Carpenter, and

3201
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,880
Steve Niles you may not remember, he also did

3202
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,880
I believe the vampire movie

3203
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,880
30 days a night

3204
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,880
So, pretty good pedigree there

3205
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,880
and I know the franchise has been pretty good

3206
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,880
Hell, Fear 2 had some pretty awesome

3207
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,880
multiplayer in it, especially with like

3208
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,880
all the maps, with like the Toy

3209
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,880
Soldier maps

3210
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,880
and the theme song for that trailer

3211
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,880
which I still can't get out of my head

3212
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,880
So

3213
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,880
Looking forward to it, and no

3214
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,880
timeframe yet when it's been announced

3215
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,880
It's supposed to be scheduled to be coming out in the fall

3216
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,880
probably around November, so

3217
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,880
on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC

3218
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,880
Is this a game you'd probably pick up?

3219
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,880
I haven't played the other ones

3220
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,880
I've been kind of curious

3221
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,880
to check it out, especially

3222
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,880
number 2, but

3223
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,880
maybe I'll check it out, I don't know

3224
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,880
Well, more information coming out on

3225
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,880
Red Dead Redemption

3226
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,880
Of course this game was also shown off at PAX East

3227
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,880
That was probably one of those other games that

3228
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,880
you would have liked to see

3229
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,880
Well, they announced this week that multiplayer

3230
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,880
Free Rome is going to be a feature in Red Dead Redemption

3231
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:50,880
I believe that's also in Grand Theft Auto 4, correct?

3232
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,880
It's something similar

3233
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,880
It sounds very similar to

3234
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:56,880
Free Mode in

3235
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,880
Grand Theft Auto 4, but this one's

3236
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,880
I would say it's closer to

3237
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,880
Party Mode in Grand Theft Auto 4

3238
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,880
where you can join in

3239
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,880
Let me describe it a little bit here

3240
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:08,880
You can explore the full single player game world

3241
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,880
but you'll be in a multiplayer environment

3242
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,880
Remember Test Drive on

3243
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,880
Xbox? It's kind of like that too

3244
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:16,880
But it's separate from the single player story mode

3245
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,880
So in Free Rome, you can either

3246
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,880
go in by yourself, or you band together with

3247
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,880
friends, it's together in 8

3248
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,880
and then you can take on other little bands

3249
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,880
You can either hunt down criminals together

3250
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,880
or just shoot the shit out of each other

3251
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,880
16 players in the same lobby

3252
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,880
at once. Then you get experience points

3253
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,880
as you do these different multiplayer modes

3254
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,880
50 levels of character progressions

3255
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:38,880
The new XP will unlock new weapons,

3256
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:40,880
mounts, characters, and challenges

3257
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:42,880
It sounds very similar to the Party Mode

3258
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,880
in Grand Theft Auto 4 because you can basically

3259
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,880
jump into

3260
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,880
It's like a lobby

3261
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,880
but it's basically just a portion of

3262
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,880
the Grand Theft Auto map and if you really want to

3263
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:54,880
you can just hang around in the lobby and

3264
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,880
drive all over the entire map

3265
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,880
or do whatever. So this is going to be

3266
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,880
very similar to that where you can

3267
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,880
play more of a free form version of the game

3268
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,880
Plus they have areas where it will

3269
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:06,880
launch different things like deathmatch modes

3270
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,880
or hunting or

3271
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,880
I believe there's a

3272
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,880
capture the gold type

3273
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,880
mode in there

3274
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,880
It'll be very cool

3275
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,880
I'm looking to try to mod this game to put

3276
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,880
a car into it

3277
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,880
I know the engine that they're using

3278
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,880
is probably extremely similar to

3279
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:26,880
Grand Theft Auto and if it's anything

3280
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,880
like that game was set up it should be

3281
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,880
very easy to do something similar like that

3282
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,880
You and your freaking hacks

3283
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,880
It would be hilarious. Always hacking something

3284
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,880
rocket launchers or something

3285
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:38,880
Alright, well let's get to the segment

3286
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,880
of the show that doesn't involve cars

3287
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:42,880
or bringing things

3288
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:44,880
into places they shouldn't be except spam

3289
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,880
we do get a lot of spam that shouldn't be in the

3290
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,880
mailbag at orangelandtrader.com

3291
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,880
mailbag at orangelandtrader.com is our email address

3292
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,880

3295

DarkSakura likes to dive into the mailbag

dsmaster26

3300
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,880
sent an email

3301
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,880
Try not to sound too excited about it

3302
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,880
It's um

3303
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,880
very badly written and

3304
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:16,880
it's giving me a headache so I think I might just

3305
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:18,880
translate it into real English

3306
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,880
Okay, go for it

3307
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:22,880
I could try and read it the way

3308
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:24,880
it's written

3309
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,880
I could do it

3310
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,880
Okay, as it's written

3311
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,880
Dear C4 and O.L.R. Crew

3312
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,880
I am giving

3313
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,880
a giant F.U.

3314
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,880
to is Microsoft because of them

3315
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:38,880
raping me

3316
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,880
in the ass for 50 bucks

3317
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,880
Okay, I can't take it anymore, translate please

3318
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,880
Okay, um

3319
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:46,880
Dear O.L.R. Crew, I'm giving a giant F.U. to Microsoft

3320
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:48,880
because of them raping me in the ass for 50 bucks a year

3321
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,880
That is crap

3322
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,880
I should have bought a 360

3323
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:54,880
I should have bought

3324
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,880
It's spelled B.O.U. not B.A.U

3325
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,880
Bought the PS3

3326
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,880
At least you should have instead of should of

3327
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,880
I hate that

3328
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,880
It is should have, would have, could have

3329
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,880
So he doesn't get an F

3330
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,880
He gets a D-

3331
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,880
So thank you for at least avoiding one of my pet peeves

3332
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,880
Um, here are the reasons

3333
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,880
why

3334
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,880
Okay

3335
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,880
Cry

3336
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,880
No, it's

3337
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,880
region is R-E-G-I-O-N

3338
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,880
Not R-E-G-I-N

3339
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,880
Um, locking

3340
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,880
new Beatmania to DX17

3341
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,880
Free online play

3342
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:32,880
No cost

3343
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,880
Netflix without paying for PSN

3344
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,880
And finally

3345
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:38,880
That's all wrong

3346
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,880
And finally, five, um

3347
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,880
Bluetooth, okay, god this sucks

3348
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,880
Punctuation

3349
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,880
Do you speak it?

3350
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:48,880
Do you speak it?

3351
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:50,880
Thank you

3352
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,880
Many phones have Bluetooth

3353
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,880
Therefore, therefore ends in an E

3354
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,880
by the way

3355
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:58,880
I can use the headset for both my phone

3356
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,880
and PS3

3357
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,880
I'm wondering

3358
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,880
Is it, I

3359
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:06,880
I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for

3360
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,880
Bimani titles for PS3 and 360

3361
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,880
Please help, I'm on a Bimani binge

3362
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:12,880
ever since I played 2DX17

3363
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:14,880
at the arcade in Omaha

3364
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:16,880
DS Master 26

3365
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,880
There's really not a lot available on the

3366
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,880
360 and PS3, I will tell you

3367
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,880
no way in hell should you spend any money on Beat and Groovy

3368
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,880
Honestly, I like DJ Hero

3369
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:26,880
a lot, I know that's not Bimani technically

3370
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,880
but as far as music game goes

3371
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,880
it's really the best with

3372
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:32,880
Rock Band

3373
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,880
Like if you're looking for like DDR and stuff

3374
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:36,880
there's just not a lot of great stuff

3375
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,880
You can go for Dance Dance Revolution Universe

3376
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,880
and I would say Universe 2

3377
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:42,880
is probably the best of the series

3378
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:44,880
You can get Universe 3 very easily though

3379
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:46,880
but it's on the

3380
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:48,880
auto games or whatever

3381
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,880
Karaoke Revolution

3382
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,880
if you like that kind of stuff

3383
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,880
Not my favorite

3384
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,880
And if you really want the true Bimani experience

3385
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:58,880
that they've brought to you straight to the next gen system

3386
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,880
then Rock Revolution is definitely a title for you

3387
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,880
That'll basically tell you

3388
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:06,880
what they think of the new systems

3389
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:08,880
There's a PS on here

3390
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,880
Okay

3391
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,880
If he does a perfect attack and freestyle DDR match

3392
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,880
he will go down, not bloody likely

3393
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,880
How do you perfect attack a freestyle?

3394
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:20,880
I think he means

3395
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,880
a perfect attack and then

3396
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,880
a freestyle

3397
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:26,880
I've seen people do both

3398
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:28,880
The guy who had one leg

3399
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:30,880
Did he even play DDR anymore?

3400
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,880
There was a guy who had one leg

3401
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,880
that played on crutches that perfect attacked

3402
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:36,880
while he did a freestyle

3403
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:38,880
You know I haven't asked him

3404
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:40,880
to listen to this show though

3405
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:42,880
so maybe he can email us and tell us

3406
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,880
I think he still kind of follows it

3407
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,880
He does a lot of DJ'ing

3408
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,880
gigs and stuff

3409
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,880
Not DJ Hero but real actual DJ'ing

3410
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:52,880
I know that's a big hobby of his now

3411
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,880
Where are they now?

3412
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,880
That would be a fun segment to do on OLR

3413
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,880
someday

3414
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,880
Where are they now? Bimani favorites

3415
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:02,880
Where is Jahi?

3416
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,880
I haven't heard from Jahi in a long time

3417
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:06,880
Maybe we need to do this

3418
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:08,880
on OLR special

3419
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:10,880
Maybe for our anniversary

3420
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,880
Find Bimani people from back in the day

3421
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,880
and do a where are they now segment

3422
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,880
A lot of our newer listeners

3423
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:18,880
wouldn't understand

3424
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:20,880
Who cares?

3425
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:22,880
I broke out the orange bat

3426
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,880
I know you did

3427
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:26,880
Have you seen Wendell lately?

3428
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:28,880
I heard he lost a lot of weight

3429
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:30,880
He's looking pretty good

3430
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,880
He's in good shape

3431
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,880
You know what we should do? Let's plan this

3432
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,880
By the way Wendell, I'm very proud of you

3433
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:38,880
Our 8th anniversary would be the last week of June

3434
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:40,880
We should try to find as many

3435
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,880
old school Bimani players

3436
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,880
as possible and invite them to a show

3437
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,880
and we could tape it

3438
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:48,880
Step Squad RTF reunion?

3439
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,880
We wouldn't necessarily have to do it here

3440
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,880
We could find a place to remote broadcast

3441
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,880
We could go to Sweet Tomatoes

3442
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:56,880
I don't know, we'll have to find a big space

3443
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:58,880
That used to be where we'd all meet up to go to dinner

3444
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,880
years and years ago

3445
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:02,880
We'd go to Sweet Tomatoes and Concord

3446
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,880
and figure something out

3447
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,880
We're gonna do that

3448
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,880
for our next anniversary show

3449
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,880
Number 9

3450
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:12,880
I should go on DDR for you, you can post something

3451
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,880
NorCal famous DDR players wanted

3452
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,880
for a reunion special or something like that

3453
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:18,880
That'd be fun

3454
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:20,880
I keep a lot of them on my Facebook

3455
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:22,880
I swear, because there are too many people to have here

3456
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:24,880
and I don't have a big garage anymore

3457
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,880
Dave and Busters

3458
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,880
We could do a road show

3459
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:30,880
I'm set up to do that because of PAX

3460
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,880
We could do a road show and on top of that

3461
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,880
We just couldn't do that live

3462
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:36,880
Actually, all contrary

3463
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:38,880
I may have my Wi-Fi tether

3464
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:40,880
on my phone working

3465
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,880
They have a Wi-Fi tether for the 3GS

3466
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:44,880
That would be tough to do

3467
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:46,880
96k to all games, that would be tough

3468
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,880
on a Wi-Fi tether

3469
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,880
I don't know

3470
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,880
If anybody knows how to do it, Scott probably does

3471
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:54,880
because I think he's done it before

3472
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:56,880
I'll talk to him about it

3473
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,880
We'll see

3474
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:00,880
Also, now

3475
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:02,880
I had received the first email

3476
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,880
that you sent me before

3477
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,880
but I've just been so wiped out and busy

3478
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,880
The man

3479
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,880
that I met at the Atari party

3480
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,880
Sal

3481
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:14,880
He sent an email and he sent me

3482
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:16,880
some stuff that I want to play

3483
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:18,880
Was that the music guy?

3484
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:20,880
I totally want to interview him

3485
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:22,880
If I was not flat broke

3486
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:24,880
I want to order one of the systems

3487
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:26,880
that he's got

3488
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:28,880
The name's for the

3489
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:30,880
Atari 800 XL

3490
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,880
Working on Outrun

3491
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:34,880
Has a version of Space Harrier

3492
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,880
that's actually really sweet

3493
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:38,880
Complete with voice, by the way

3494
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,880
I'm very impressed

3495
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,880
I'll go ahead and give him a plug

3496
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,880
It's

3497
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,880
KJ Mann's

3498
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,880
Atari Sales and Electronics

3499
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:50,880
You'll find him on eBay

3500
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,880
He's really cool

3501
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:54,880
The stuff

3502
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:56,880
The ports that he's worked with

3503
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:58,880
are just amazing

3504
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:00,880
They're amazing

3505
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:02,880
I'm very impressed

3506
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,880
We'll try to get him on the show

3507
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:06,880
It'll be fun

3508
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:08,880
We'll get him to come to this OLR Con

3509
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:10,880
we're suddenly planning

3510
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,880
I wonder how much it costs to rent

3511
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,880
a big hall somewhere

3512
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,880
Maybe we should call it OLR Con

3513
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:18,880
Just do OLR Con, for real

3514
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,880
Just fucking do it already

3515
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,880
My brain just suddenly made

3516
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:24,880
OLR Con asylum

3517
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,880
I don't know

3518
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,880
We'll have to think about it

3519
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:30,880
How could we do OLR Con and not have it fail miserably

3520
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,880
where we're going to spend a lot of money on it

3521
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:34,880
I don't know, we have to think about this

3522
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,880
I think it's King of Rush

3523
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:38,880
Okay

3524
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,880
Why was Rob's mom

3525
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,880
pwning all of us with that last phrase?

3526
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:44,880
That must have been texted or something

3527
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,880
during the show

3528
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,880
Cause she's my mother, it's where I get my sense of humor from

3529
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,880
And don't you dare

3530
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,880
be trash about her

3531
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,880
Rob's mom is such a nice lady

3532
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,880
She's fun

3533
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:58,880
So, I got one from Rababa

3534
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:00,880
That's an Orange Lounge

3535
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,880
radio

3536
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,880
wordle

3537
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:06,880
And, dude, I love

3538
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:08,880
anything that's typography

3539
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,880
Oh, I saw that, it's like the art

3540
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:12,880
with all the common words from our

3541
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,880
website, kind of like if it's used

3542
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,880
a lot, then it's big, if it's not

3543
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:18,880
B4U

3544
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,880
B4U, at the time he did that

3545
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:22,880
was like being highlighted

3546
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:24,880
as like the, I love that song

3547
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:26,880
You know that segment, the Dark Tetsuya in Act F

3548
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:28,880
that some people do for our site?

3549
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,880
I think B4U was like the song

3550
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:32,880
that was up at the moment that that happened

3551
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:34,880
I'm totally going to save the pictures

3552
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,880
I mean, it's generated in Flash, but I have this

3553
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:38,880
There's this little

3554
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:40,880
fun tool to grab

3555
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:42,880
images off by doing

3556
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:44,880
just a plain old screenshot of it

3557
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,880
You can crop them, I love this thing

3558
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:48,880
and I'm trying to remember, I think it's called Pixlr

3559
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:50,880
It's a plug-in for

3560
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,880
um

3561
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:54,880
whatever the crap this program is

3562
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:56,880
that I'm using

3563
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:58,880
But anyway

3564
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:00,880
Um

3565
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:02,880
But yeah, it's really cool, I like it

3566
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:04,880
And

3567
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:06,880
he

3568
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:08,880
I like, he puts a comment that I suppose

3569
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,880
that wordle filters out crashwords

3570
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:12,880
Um, and

3571
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:14,880
then the last one is

3572
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,880
um

3573
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,880
from somebody

3574
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:20,880
who hasn't put a name on here

3575
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:22,880
I'm just going to say Brandon

3576
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,880
because that's the

3577
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:26,880
closest thing I can find

3578
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:28,880
Dear OLR, after listening to OLR archive episode

3579
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,880
I have started

3580
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:32,880
to have a bimani craze

3581
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:34,880
so I spent my whole allowance

3582
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:36,880
$30 on tokens

3583
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,880
and I played some BeatMania 2DX, read

3584
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:40,880
Cranked

3585
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:42,880
to 11

3586
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,880
Guitar Freaks, Drummania

3587
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,880
Parapara, DDR, Poppin' Music

3588
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:48,880
and keyboardmania, it was epic fun

3589
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,880
Rob,

3590
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:52,880
we need to go

3591
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:54,880
to Rviggle soon

3592
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,880
We can go, I mean

3593
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:58,880
it's just down the street

3594
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:00,880
I know, but I want to play

3595
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,880
Rob, I gotta dance

3596
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:08,880
Alright

3597
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:10,880
Well anyhow, let's move on

3598
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:12,880
to the part of the show

3599
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,880
where we get a little bit of angst off our

3600
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,880
chest, it's the FUs of the week

3601
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,880
and they're going to start right now

3602
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:34,880
FU to the

3603
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:36,880
big pile of

3604
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:38,880
carrot cake in my fridge

3605
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:40,880
I

3606
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:42,880
have eaten almost nothing but carrot cake

3607
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:44,880
all day, except when I came home

3608
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,880
and ate a rib

3609
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:48,880
I ate a rib

3610
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:50,880
Oh, and some chips

3611
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:52,880
It was very tasty rib, it was delicious

3612
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:54,880
and I think

3613
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:56,880
he got kosher beef too

3614
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:58,880
anyway, it was really good

3615
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,880
but anyway

3616
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,880
I can't

3617
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:04,880
I can't eat any more cake

3618
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,880
I can't, I don't think that I can

3619
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,880
and my

3620
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:10,880
my tummy behaved

3621
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,880
very well yesterday despite all the beer

3622
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:14,880
I think all the beer broke everything else down

3623
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,880
but today I'm suffering for it, so

3624
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:18,880
fuck you gluten

3625
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,880
done

3626
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:22,880
Go ahead Logie

3627
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:24,880
FU to the KFC

3628
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:26,880
special sauce that they put on the

3629
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:28,880
KFC Double Down, it really

3630
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:30,880
ruined the Double Down and it's unfortunate

3631
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,880
because it had the potential to be

3632
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,880
a great, unhealthy piece of

3633
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:36,880
chicken that I could have eaten

3634
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:38,880
but instead it was

3635
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,880
just all nasty sauce that they tasted

3636
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:42,880
maybe next time I will have to do

3637
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,880
the pseudo

3638
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,880
Windows 7 burger and get a 7x7

3639
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:48,880
from

3640
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:50,880
Oops, Holik came in early, my bad

3641
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:52,880
I was gonna say that

3642
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:54,880
FU to Holik, playing early

3643
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:56,880
anyways, yeah, so

3644
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,880
a

3645
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:00,880
I should do a Windows

3646
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:02,880
7 pseudo burger

3647
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,880
from In-N-Out 7x7

3648
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:06,880
I've had a

3649
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,880
4x4 before, they're really

3650
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:10,880
not as filling as you would think

3651
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:12,880
My FU

3652
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:14,880
of the week goes to my confidence

3653
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:16,880
and self esteem because I'm starting a new job

3654
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,880
tomorrow and I'm really nervous

3655
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:20,880
it's gonna be like so

3656
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:22,880
different for me, they're all gonna laugh at you

3657
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:24,880
laugh at me, no, I know I'll do fine

3658
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:26,880
but it's just, it's weird because like guys

3659
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:28,880
seriously, the day job I've had, I've been

3660
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:30,880
because, okay, it was funny because when

3661
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,880
I post, I have listeners on my Facebook and when I

3662
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,880
posted to Facebook that I was leaving my old

3663
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,880
job, people were like, oh, you get to do OLR full

3664
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:38,880
time now and I'm like

3665
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,880
hahaha

3666
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:42,880
hahaha

3667
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,880
hahaha, that's funny

3668
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:46,880
yeah

3669
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:48,880
no, I mean, it's

3670
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:50,880
great that people think that we could actually

3671
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,880
profit from this show, but no, my

3672
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:54,880
day job that I do

3673
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:56,880
the day job I have to pay them, in fact

3674
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:58,880
trying to plan this OLR con, I'm

3675
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:00,880
thinking like, how do I lose the least

3676
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:02,880
amount of money in planning this

3677
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:04,880
but anyway

3678
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:06,880
on a

3679
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,880
serious note, I have a day job and the day job I've had

3680
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:10,880
I've had for the past like seven years

3681
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,880
so almost as long as OLR has been

3682
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,880
going on, which is a fucking long time, just you know

3683
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:16,880
and I'm changing that, I'm doing

3684
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:18,880
a new job starting tomorrow and it's

3685
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,880
kind of nerve-wracking, but

3686
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:22,880
I think it'll be good, I'm

3687
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:24,880
excited about what the

3688
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:26,880
new position is and obviously I don't like to talk a lot about

3689
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:28,880
my day job on the show, because I don't want no presents

3690
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:30,880
showing up at my workplace

3691
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:32,880
or bombs, you know what I mean

3692
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:34,880
yeah, please no, just

3693
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:36,880
no, so anyhow

3694
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:38,880
yeah, I mean, I think it's great

3695
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:40,880
that people send gifts, but I don't know, just something

3696
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:42,880
weird about having my address out there

3697
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:44,880
I'd just like to know who you are, that's all

3698
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:46,880
it was also on my business card, well, our

3699
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,880
Orange Lunch Radio business card

3700
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:50,880
so you think one of our...

3701
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:52,880
someone could have gotten it, I don't know, who knows, alright, anyhow

3702
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:54,880
I'm over it, alright, that's it for the FUs

3703
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:56,880
of the Week, couple more news stories for you guys

3704
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:58,880
then the Skype line, and believe it or not

3705
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:00,880
our chat, or I'm sorry

3706
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:02,880
our phone works again, it was broken

3707
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:04,880
last week, it works again

3708
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:06,880
877-GAME-OLR works

3709
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:08,880
also Orange Lunch Radio on Skype, both

3710
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,880
of them will work, but we're not taking calls yet

3711
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:12,880
we still got two more stories, Loki

3712
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:14,880
yes, so let's talk a little

3713
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,880
bit about how

3714
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:18,880
not to do collector's editions

3715
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:20,880
that's right, Splinter Cell

3716
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:22,880
Conviction, it's a wonderful game

3717
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,880
coming out this coming week

3718
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:26,880
here, and apparently

3719
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:28,880
they're dropping $10 off the

3720
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:30,880
price of the collector's edition because

3721
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:32,880
guess what, the USB drive that they included

3722
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,880
with it is faulty

3723
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:36,880
apparently there's

3724
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,880
a possibility of faulty USB drives

3725
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:40,880
included with the game, and so

3726
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:42,880
they're knocking $10 off of it to

3727
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,880
kind of compensate for that

3728
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:46,880
and apparently none of the other

3729
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:48,880
content has been affected, but

3730
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:50,880
the bonus content included on the USB

3731
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,880
drive may be inaccessible

3732
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:54,880
in some copies

3733
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,880
well that turned out

3734
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,880
to be a bummer for someone, didn't it?

3735
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:00,880
yeah, that is a bummer, and

3736
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:02,880
let me tell you this much

3737
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,880
from a

3738
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:06,880
distributor, reseller

3739
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:08,880
standpoint, that's gonna be

3740
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,880
a fucking bitch when I come in on Monday

3741
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:12,880
because we're gonna have to deal with all

3742
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:14,880
these credits to people that

3743
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,880
we sold the game to because

3744
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:18,880
Ubisoft fucked up, so

3745
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:20,880
thank you, Ubisoft

3746
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:22,880
appreciate it

3747
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:24,880
and whoever manufactured those little USB cards

3748
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:26,880
are gonna get taken to the cleaners

3749
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:28,880
you know what I mean?

3750
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:30,880
yeah

3751
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:32,880
and you know, really the USB cards

3752
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,880
what they have on them here, they've got a little

3753
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:36,880
artwork here

3754
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:38,880
is a credit card size

3755
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:40,880
USB drive that had

3756
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:42,880
making of video, concept art renders

3757
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:44,880
screenshots, storyboards

3758
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:46,880
and wallpapers, who gives a shit

3759
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:48,880
well can't you format that thing now and use it as

3760
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,880
storage on your 360?

3761
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:52,880
no you cannot because I don't believe it is over a gig

3762
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:54,880
you need at least a gig

3763
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:56,880
to be able to use it, so

3764
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,880
and you really wanna have 16 gigs

3765
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:00,880
cause you only get two cards, right?

3766
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:02,880
this is so weird to me

3767
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:04,880
so weird to me, well it was kind of a slow news week

3768
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:06,880
and we found this article on

3769
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,880
as a popular destination on Dig

3770
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,880
and I thought what the hell, we'll bring it up on the show

3771
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:12,880
it's from IGN and it talks about the most

3772
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,880
anticipated Xbox Live arcade games

3773
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:16,880
that are coming up to the service

3774
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:18,880
and I thought I'd kind of gauge the reaction here

3775
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:20,880
in studio, if our studio folks are excited

3776
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:22,880
about these games, and those of you in chat

3777
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:24,880
as well, kind of leading into

3778
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:26,880
phone calls, this makes a good story

3779
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,880
this is from IGN.com, so you know, take it with a grain of salt

3780
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:30,880
Limbo

3781
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:32,880
is one of the games that they talk about here

3782
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:34,880
and this was pretty cool, they had

3783
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:36,880
they were demoing this at PAX East, it's kind of like that

3784
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:38,880
black and white, very artistic kind of

3785
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,880
style with it, look kind of neat

3786
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:42,880
Sonic the Hedgehog 4

3787
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:44,880
very anticipated Xbox Live game

3788
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,880
Yay!

3789
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:48,880
Shank!

3790
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:50,880
That was being shown at PAX earlier this year

3791
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,880
it's not Shaft, but Shank

3792
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,880
and he has a steel blade

3793
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:56,880
it's very bloody, looks like your kind of game

3794
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:58,880
Hydrophobia, which was also

3795
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:00,880
shown at PAX East, it's like

3796
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:02,880
kind of a Tomb Raider-ish type of game

3797
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,880
but she's afraid of the water

3798
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:06,880
well that makes me think of Bioshock

3799
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:08,880
Puzzle Quest 2

3800
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,880
Don't care

3801
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:12,880
Speak for yourself, I am totally on this

3802
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:14,880
That's why I was speaking for myself, I don't care

3803
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,880
I do care, so I'm excited about that

3804
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:18,880
Might and Magic Clash of Heroes

3805
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:20,880
Don't care

3806
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,880
Yeah, looks like it could be interesting

3807
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,880
The art style looks really good

3808
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:26,880
because it's

3809
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:28,880
They have it on the DS

3810
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:30,880
Super Meat Boy

3811
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:32,880
Yay!

3812
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:34,880
Don't care

3813
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,880
I have a custom coffee mug

3814
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,880
that I painted Super Meat Boy on

3815
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:40,880
Oh really? That's cute

3816
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:42,880
Also on the other side has Eduardo the Samurai Toaster

3817
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:44,880
That's my WeWear

3818
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:46,880
coffee mug that I made

3819
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:48,880
And I'm actually kidding, it looks interesting

3820
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:50,880
Comic Jumper

3821
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,880
I don't know this one

3822
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:54,880
Oh, The Maw and Explosion Man

3823
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,880
That's a good developer there

3824
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,880
Okay, Comedy Shooter

3825
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:00,880
Is that supposed to be like Earthworm Jim or something?

3826
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,880
Probably, similar

3827
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:04,880
Monday Night Combat

3828
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:06,880
That looks awesome

3829
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:08,880
They had a business at PAX East

3830
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:10,880
And they had an announcer guy out there on the show floor

3831
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:12,880
So it seems like all of these games

3832
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:14,880
were just PAX East games

3833
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:16,880
I think someone at IGN

3834
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:18,880
got a little lazy

3835
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,880
There you go

3836
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:22,880
I'm also looking forward to Magic Sword Double Impact

3837
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:24,880
Or whatever they're actually calling it

3838
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:26,880
That's coming out

3839
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,880
So funny

3840
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:32,880
Anyhow, the phones

3841
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:34,880
are now open

3842
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:36,880
And Game OLR or our username on Skype

3843
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:38,880
is OrangeLoungeRadio

3844
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:40,880
If you'd like to call to talk about, I don't know

3845
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:42,880
Anticipated Xbox Live Arcade Games or heck anything

3846
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:44,880
I know, you know, we were out

3847
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:46,880
two weeks ago and then last week

3848
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:48,880
we had some troubles with the phones and we were only able to

3849
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:50,880
take a couple calls

3850
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,880
So I'm sure there will be plenty of people who want to get through tonight

3851
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:54,880
And that's fine, we have a little extra time for calls

3852
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:56,880
I don't want to do the show too late tonight

3853
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,880
But we have some time for calls

3854
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:00,880
So again, 877 Game OLR

3855
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:02,880
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3856
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:04,880
It is now open and available for calls

3857
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:06,880
SHA100Matt wants us to know

3858
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,880
he played MNC at PAX East

3859
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:10,880
and it was awesome

3860
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:12,880
Okay, the phones are starting to ring, here we go

3861
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:14,880
Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3862
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:16,880
It's Ranma

3863
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:18,880
Looks like I got through the first time once again

3864
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:20,880
Look at you, you must have the

3865
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:22,880
least amount of lag or something

3866
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:24,880
Well, what's up?

3867
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:26,880
Not too much, man

3868
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:28,880
Couple of things now

3869
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:30,880
To reference back to earlier in the episode

3870
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,880
They did port Twilight Seen It

3871
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:34,880
to the Nintendo DS

3872
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:36,880
Came out about a couple of months ago

3873
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:38,880
But Twilight Seen It

3874
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:40,880
isn't like a Twilight game to me

3875
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:42,880
I know, but

3876
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:44,880
I get your points

3877
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:46,880
But it's just like, they need to make an actual game

3878
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:48,880
Well, actually they don't need to, but I'm surprised

3879
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:50,880
they haven't, you know what I mean?

3880
02:17:50,880 --> 02:17:52,880
Well, Rob, I'm all for a

3881
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:54,880
Twilight game, provided it plays

3882
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:56,880
in a third person shooter like Conker's Bad Fur Day

3883
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:58,880
and I get to shoot them all up

3884
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:00,880
Then I will buy that

3885
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:02,880
I don't know if I'd

3886
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:04,880
buy it, but I might get it on Gamefly

3887
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:08,880
So that way I feel like I'm not

3888
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:10,880
really supporting them, but

3889
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:12,880
even if I am a little bit

3890
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:14,880
You won't feel as dirty

3891
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:16,880
Alright, well there you go

3892
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:18,880
What else is on your mind, buddy?

3893
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:20,880
About an article earlier today

3894
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:22,880
about the kid that stole the code from Breach

3895
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:24,880
Yes, although

3896
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:26,880
technically that was last week's show, but that's okay

3897
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:28,880
Last week we had the phone problems

3898
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:30,880
What do you think?

3899
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:32,880
I was trying to call in, but

3900
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,880
on our podcast we covered this

3901
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,880
and my

3902
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:38,880
gaming girl who did

3903
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:40,880
some research on the article

3904
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:42,880
it seems that

3905
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:44,880
the company that did the game I think is Atomic Games

3906
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,880
they're backed by the CIA

3907
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:48,880
so I'm

3908
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:50,880
kind of thinking that this was all like a little

3909
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:52,880
set up, like a publicity stunt

3910
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:54,880
Well, now hold on

3911
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:56,880
Didn't they say that because

3912
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:58,880
of what you're saying that it actually

3913
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:00,880
made this theft of the code a lot

3914
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:02,880
worse than it would be otherwise

3915
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:04,880
like this kid is almost being

3916
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:06,880
investigated by the FBI at this point

3917
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,880
I don't know, I might be throwing in some extra

3918
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:10,880
stuff there, but it seemed like

3919
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:12,880
from what we were reporting last week, what he did

3920
02:19:12,880 --> 02:19:14,880
wasn't just bad, it was really bad

3921
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:16,880
Pretty much

3922
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:18,880
but if you're going to cross reference that

3923
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:20,880
in, I'm just saying

3924
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:22,880
because of how this came out

3925
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:24,880
I don't know about you, but

3926
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:26,880
if this was a big deal, don't you think everybody

3927
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:28,880
at PAX would have been hearing about this?

3928
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:32,880
Maybe they did, maybe it just happened

3929
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:34,880
at a time we weren't around, I don't know

3930
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:36,880
I certainly didn't hear anything like that

3931
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:38,880
I didn't either, but at the same time

3932
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,880
I was kind of in and out of there

3933
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:42,880
we left to eat, we left

3934
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:44,880
I came in late a lot of days

3935
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:46,880
just because of the time zone thing

3936
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:48,880
I don't know

3937
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:50,880
It would be a really weird

3938
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:52,880
obesity stunt type of thing

3939
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:54,880
Weren't there court documents produced

3940
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:56,880
and everything too?

3941
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:58,880
I have no idea

3942
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:00,880
I have not heard anything about it

3943
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:02,880
I will believe

3944
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:04,880
this guy actually did something

3945
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:06,880
stupid, you know

3946
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:08,880
but if there are no court documents, I call shenanigans

3947
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:10,880
I see where you're coming from though

3948
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:12,880
how could someone be so

3949
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:14,880
colossally stupid, it just seems so fake

3950
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:16,880
but some people

3951
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,880
are that stupid, Rama

3952
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:20,880
I know, I used to work

3953
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:22,880
with people like that

3954
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:24,880
Well

3955
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,880
I don't know, fake or not

3956
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:28,880
it certainly has got everybody talking

3957
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:30,880
which, yeah

3958
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:32,880
you might have hit the nail on the head of the irony

3959
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:34,880
of it, is that more people are talking about this game now

3960
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:36,880
than probably would have otherwise

3961
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:38,880
Pretty much

3962
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:40,880
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, my friend?

3963
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:44,880
That's pretty much it

3964
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:48,880
ActDeaf in our chat wants to say Matt posted the court files earlier

3965
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:50,880
He's probably digging up the links again right now

3966
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:52,880
so stay tuned to our chat rooms

3967
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,880
Yeah, I'll definitely be following that

3968
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:56,880
Alright, take care buddy

3969
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:58,880
Alright, bye-bye

3970
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:00,880
Let's go back to the phones

3971
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:02,880
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio, who's this?

3972
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:04,880
Hi, it's Ray Iyanami

3973
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:06,880
Hey, Ray Iyanami, what's on your mind, buddy?

3974
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:10,880
I came up from Stock Card Con last week

3975
02:21:10,880 --> 02:21:12,880
my first Stock Card Con

3976
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:14,880
You went all the way up to Seattle

3977
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,880
to go to Stock Card Con?

3978
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:18,880
Yes, I went with some friends

3979
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:20,880
to meet up with some friends up there

3980
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:22,880
among other things

3981
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:24,880
Well, I don't know, you don't sound too happy

3982
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:26,880
was it a good time, or what happened?

3983
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:28,880
I'm sorry, I'm just tired for this week

3984
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:30,880
so

3985
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:34,880
Anyway, Stock Card Con is pretty cool, yes

3986
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:38,880
I get to play a lot of games there

3987
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:40,880
like Tetris or Grandmaster 3

3988
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:44,880
and some other crap

3989
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:47,880
Well, I'm glad you said nice things about it in the end

3990
02:21:47,880 --> 02:21:49,880
because our buddy John who does

3991
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:51,880
Understation Live with Travis

3992
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:53,880
I know is a big part of putting on Stock Card Con

3993
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:55,880
Did you happen to run into him at all?

3994
02:21:55,880 --> 02:21:57,880
He's probably too busy

3995
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:00,880
I saw him hosting the Anime Magician panel

3996
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:02,880
but

3997
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,880
I didn't get a chance to talk to him much

3998
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:06,880
so I never actually got to meet him

3999
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:08,880
Eh, it happens

4000
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:10,880
Had you ever been to that venue before?

4001
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:12,880
Because that's the same place they do PAX Prime

4002
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,880
No, it was my first time

4003
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,880
I was surprised at how big it was

4004
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:21,880
I could actually compare it to a shopping mall

4005
02:22:21,880 --> 02:22:24,880
Especially since part of it is like a shopping mall

4006
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:27,880
Yeah, it's kind of integrated right into the downtown scene there, isn't it?

4007
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:29,880
Well, tell us a little more about the gaming they had there

4008
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:31,880
Did they have like a big room? Were they doing tournaments?

4009
02:22:31,880 --> 02:22:33,880
What was kind of going on with gaming?

4010
02:22:33,880 --> 02:22:35,880
Well, they had an arcade

4011
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:37,880
but it wasn't too big

4012
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:39,880
Mostly DVR

4013
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:41,880
In the Groove

4014
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:44,880
They had a Pumped Up Pro 2 Location Test

4015
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:46,880
They had NFL Day 4

4016
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:48,880
guitar-proofing, drum-mania

4017
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:51,880
and Patrick P, Jim's Threes and myself already

4018
02:22:51,880 --> 02:22:54,880
I would have played Pumped Up Pro 2

4019
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:57,880
but unfortunately, like the 2DS, I was at the con

4020
02:22:57,880 --> 02:23:00,880
I was wearing a concept that involved dress shoes

4021
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:02,880
and dress shoes and

4022
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,880
arrow-stopping games

4023
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,880
those seemed like a good idea

4024
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:08,880
Were you cosplaying?

4025
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:10,880
What were you cosplaying as?

4026
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:12,880
I was cosplaying as a

4027
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:14,880
shell from Pop'n Music

4028
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:16,880
the librarian guy

4029
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:18,880
and Apollo Justice

4030
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,880
I wanted to cosplay as this one character

4031
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:22,880
cosplay as this one character from Toho

4032
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:24,880
but I didn't have a costume prepared

4033
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:26,880
and

4034
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:28,880
speaking of the Toho panel

4035
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:30,880
there was one thing that I didn't like about it

4036
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:33,880
and that was them trying to demonstrate the Toho games

4037
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:36,880
they tried to demonstrate it by showing

4038
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:38,880
one of the game's later stages

4039
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:40,880
on lunatic difficulty

4040
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:42,880
but it's basically a difficulty level of a part

4041
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:44,880
and as a small fan, they kind of pissed me off

4042
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:48,880
Because maybe they made the game look way harder than it really is?

4043
02:23:48,880 --> 02:23:50,880
Yeah, pretty much

4044
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:53,880
I mean, I'm pretty sure a lot of the people who weren't really into

4045
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:55,880
the Naku games were just confused

4046
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:57,880
what the hell was going on

4047
02:23:57,880 --> 02:23:59,880
I mean, if I was running

4048
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:00,880
If I was

4049
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:02,880
If I had a partner running the panel

4050
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:04,880
alongside the infamous stuff

4051
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:06,880
I would also show demonstration using

4052
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:08,880
easier stages and difficulties

4053
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:11,880
Something that requires effort

4054
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:13,880
to get through

4055
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:15,880
but is still pretty watchable

4056
02:24:15,880 --> 02:24:17,880
that way people who are new to the series

4057
02:24:17,880 --> 02:24:19,880
can have a grasp of

4058
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:21,880
what it's like to play the game

4059
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:23,880
instead of just saying

4060
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:25,880
Oh wow, pretty bullets, super adequate

4061
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:27,880
dodge, any of that shit

4062
02:24:27,880 --> 02:24:29,880
Yeah, it's

4063
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:31,880
I gotta say though

4064
02:24:31,880 --> 02:24:33,880
a lot of those shmups are so hard to me

4065
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:35,880
but you know, it takes talent

4066
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:37,880
to be good at them though, takes talent

4067
02:24:37,880 --> 02:24:39,880
That's for sure

4068
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:41,880
I mean, whenever I try to show people

4069
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:43,880
games, I don't go

4070
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:45,880
straight to like full rising

4071
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:47,880
if it's a fighting game or

4072
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:49,880
showing them level 43 points on top

4073
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:51,880
I try to show them

4074
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:53,880
easier stuff, something you can actually understand

4075
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:55,880
Like, a few months ago

4076
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:57,880
I was at an arcade with a friend of mine

4077
02:24:57,880 --> 02:24:59,880
and she went through the top

4078
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:01,880
so I kind of

4079
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:03,880
popped into her use of easier

4080
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:05,880
songs, even if it meant songs that

4081
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:07,880
I didn't find to be as fun as

4082
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:09,880
songs that I usually play

4083
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:11,880
That's a really good point, is that if you're not wanting to scare someone

4084
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:13,880
off, especially with the music games, you shouldn't

4085
02:25:13,880 --> 02:25:15,880
show off right away, like a lot of people

4086
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:17,880
I think sometimes just want to like show off

4087
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:19,880
how good they are at a game, so they'll pick like

4088
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:21,880
the really hard song and like, look how cool this game

4089
02:25:21,880 --> 02:25:23,880
can be, and then people are like, ooh, I'm too scared to touch that

4090
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:25,880
I don't want to touch that, so you kind of have to

4091
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:27,880
warn people into it by showing them like, you know, on

4092
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:29,880
the rock band, the easy mode, or you know

4093
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:31,880
a one star, whatever difficulties

4094
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:33,880
they're doing in pop music these days

4095
02:25:33,880 --> 02:25:35,880
you know, the really low end songs

4096
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:37,880
and that kind of goes with video games in general, like if you

4097
02:25:37,880 --> 02:25:39,880
don't want to scare someone off, like you know they wouldn't

4098
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:41,880
like a shooter game, don't show them Halo

4099
02:25:41,880 --> 02:25:43,880
or Gears of War, show them a video game

4100
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:45,880
that might be more their tastes

4101
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:47,880
you know, like whether that be something like

4102
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:49,880
one versus a hundred, you know, might be

4103
02:25:49,880 --> 02:25:51,880
a really good enabler for people

4104
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:53,880
to see that there's more to video games than that

4105
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:55,880
or, you know, something on the Wii

4106
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:57,880
I don't know, it is interesting

4107
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:59,880
I think sometimes people really

4108
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:01,880
scare people off from video games without realizing it

4109
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:03,880
because they go right for the hard stuff

4110
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:05,880
and a lot of people do get intimidated

4111
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:07,880
Yeah, there

4112
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:09,880
are, I think, channels and forums

4113
02:26:09,880 --> 02:26:11,880
I hang out at where people are not

4114
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:13,880
too good at video games, so

4115
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:15,880
I kind of get

4116
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:17,880
how they feel about not being

4117
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:19,880
able to get past the

4118
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:21,880
first season for Shmopp on, even on easy

4119
02:26:21,880 --> 02:26:23,880
difficulty

4120
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:25,880
Alright, well

4121
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:27,880
we gotta let you go so we can get some more

4122
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:29,880
calls, but, so, SakuraCon, do you think

4123
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:31,880
you'd try to go back next year?

4124
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:33,880
Um, possibly

4125
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:35,880
if my spring break is around

4126
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:37,880
SakuraCon again, because that lets you

4127
02:26:37,880 --> 02:26:39,880
one big deciding factor

4128
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:41,880
in me doing it. Last year it didn't line up

4129
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:43,880
with my spring break, so I didn't go

4130
02:26:43,880 --> 02:26:45,880
So if the timing's right, it just might be in the

4131
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:47,880
cards. Alright, well, we gotta let you go

4132
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:49,880
to get more calls, but take care of Ray, okay?

4133
02:26:49,880 --> 02:26:51,880
You too. Alright, later

4134
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:53,880
Alright, I'll take a couple more calls

4135
02:26:53,880 --> 02:26:55,880
here. 877-GAME-OLR

4136
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:57,880
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

4137
02:26:57,880 --> 02:26:59,880
Take a few more calls

4138
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:01,880
here before we call it a night at

4139
02:27:01,880 --> 02:27:03,880
OLR Studios. Some last minute

4140
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:05,880
stories tonight we'll have in just a moment

4141
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:07,880
but first, another call. Hi, you're

4142
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:09,880
on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

4143
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:11,880
Hi, this is Spasinator

4144
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:13,880
Hey, Spasinator, you're

4145
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:15,880
cutting in and out a little bit, but we'll try to move

4146
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:17,880
ahead. What's on your mind, buddy?

4147
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:19,880
Sorry about that, I'm on a

4148
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:21,880
cell phone and unfortunately some

4149
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:23,880
stuff in my building interferes

4150
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:25,880
with the signal. That's okay.

4151
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:27,880
But anyway, I tried

4152
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:29,880
calling in last week to give you

4153
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:31,880
updates as to my

4154
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:33,880
PlayStation 3 situation

4155
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:35,880
Oh yeah, it's been a little while since we heard about that

4156
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:37,880
Yeah, we had our phone issues last week. Well, what's

4157
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:39,880
the latest and greatest?

4158
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:41,880
I can make this short

4159
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:43,880
and sweet. You know,

4160
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:45,880
I'll probably gloss over the details, but

4161
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:47,880
the drill points are

4162
02:27:47,880 --> 02:27:49,880
that I got my

4163
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:51,880
PS3 back on the 30th

4164
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:53,880
and

4165
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:55,880
a few days later, they

4166
02:27:55,880 --> 02:27:57,880
started putting my

4167
02:27:57,880 --> 02:27:59,880
videos back onto my

4168
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:01,880
download queue

4169
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:03,880
because the video store

4170
02:28:03,880 --> 02:28:05,880
works differently than the

4171
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:07,880
game side of the store. Anyway,

4172
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:09,880
it took a while

4173
02:28:09,880 --> 02:28:11,880
for everything to show up

4174
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:13,880
because they had to do

4175
02:28:13,880 --> 02:28:15,880
everything manually

4176
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:17,880
and reauthorize everything

4177
02:28:17,880 --> 02:28:19,880
and I get like over several hundred

4178
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:21,880
videos, but needless

4179
02:28:21,880 --> 02:28:23,880
to say, I

4180
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:25,880
got all my videos back, so I don't have to

4181
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:27,880
worry about that now.

4182
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:29,880
Wow, 700 videos. Oh my gosh.

4183
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:31,880
Okay.

4184
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:33,880
Yeah, well, not all those videos

4185
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:35,880
are paid for. Some of those are

4186
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:37,880
like

4187
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:39,880
the free music game

4188
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:41,880
out is like promotions to get

4189
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:43,880
you to buy throughout the series

4190
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:45,880
or whatever that's there.

4191
02:28:45,880 --> 02:28:47,880
But

4192
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:49,880
needless to say, I got my

4193
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:51,880
videos back and

4194
02:28:51,880 --> 02:28:53,880
hopefully

4195
02:28:53,880 --> 02:28:55,880
nothing goes wrong with

4196
02:28:55,880 --> 02:28:57,880
the video service in the future, but

4197
02:28:57,880 --> 02:28:59,880
I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed

4198
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:01,880
on that, so.

4199
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:03,880
I'm sorry,

4200
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:05,880
I didn't mean it. No, that's right.

4201
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:07,880
I know you say you didn't want to get into too many of the

4202
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:09,880
details, but I'm kind of curious because I know you

4203
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:11,880
they were putting, I mean, it sounds like in

4204
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:13,880
the end, you got what you

4205
02:29:13,880 --> 02:29:15,880
really needed

4206
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:17,880
and deserved back. I mean, it sounds like

4207
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:19,880
it had to be a very manual process

4208
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:21,880
for Sony, so it sounds like they almost weren't set up

4209
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:23,880
to handle a request like yours, but

4210
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:25,880
I'm kind of curious, how did you ultimately

4211
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:27,880
kind of get them to come

4212
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:29,880
around, because you were going back and forth with them.

4213
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:31,880
If you go back a few episodes in the show when you were first calling

4214
02:29:31,880 --> 02:29:33,880
in about this, you were going back and forth

4215
02:29:33,880 --> 02:29:35,880
with Sony a little bit, and we told you

4216
02:29:35,880 --> 02:29:37,880
you might have to speak with the supervisor or just kind of

4217
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:39,880
put up a stink. I mean, is that what ultimately

4218
02:29:39,880 --> 02:29:41,880
happened? You sadly had to be

4219
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:43,880
that guy on the phone in order for them to finally

4220
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:45,880
listen to you?

4221
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:47,880
This time around,

4222
02:29:47,880 --> 02:29:49,880
not to the same extent,

4223
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:51,880
although I did

4224
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:53,880
keep what you and Dr.

4225
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:55,880
Zirk said in

4226
02:29:55,880 --> 02:29:57,880
mind the initial time I

4227
02:29:57,880 --> 02:29:59,880
hit this problem,

4228
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:01,880
and initially

4229
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:03,880
it looked like I was going to have to go that road

4230
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:05,880
because the first person I spoke to

4231
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:07,880
said

4232
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:09,880
to sum it up,

4233
02:30:09,880 --> 02:30:11,880
sorry dude,

4234
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:13,880
you're so low on that,

4235
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:15,880
but

4236
02:30:15,880 --> 02:30:17,880
in subsequent calls

4237
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:19,880
speaking to other reps

4238
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:21,880
prior to me saying I'm a machine

4239
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:23,880
and they said, yeah, once you send the machine

4240
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:25,880
in and they send it

4241
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:27,880
back to me,

4242
02:30:27,880 --> 02:30:29,880
they'll do everything and reauthorize

4243
02:30:29,880 --> 02:30:31,880
everything to download.

4244
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:33,880
You know,

4245
02:30:33,880 --> 02:30:35,880
I just have to interject here,

4246
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:37,880
because as someone who has worked very closely

4247
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:39,880
with call centers in their

4248
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:41,880
day job, to me

4249
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:43,880
that's a huge issue that you

4250
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:45,880
called in two times and got two different

4251
02:30:45,880 --> 02:30:47,880
answers. And for anybody,

4252
02:30:47,880 --> 02:30:49,880
you know, Sony's a big company and who knows

4253
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:51,880
we might have somebody at Sony who happens to listen to

4254
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:53,880
this program. To me, that's a big issue.

4255
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:55,880
You should not call a call center, speak to two

4256
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:57,880
different people and get two different answers.

4257
02:30:57,880 --> 02:30:59,880
I agree with that. I actually did customer

4258
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:01,880
service for a very long time and I did

4259
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:03,880
well

4260
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:05,880
by the time the department was called Service Quality where we

4261
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:07,880
if they had a question they could

4262
02:31:07,880 --> 02:31:09,880
call us and ask us and we would tell them

4263
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:11,880
and make sure you repeat this.

4264
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:13,880
But yeah, everyone is supposed to be

4265
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:15,880
on the same page. And don't get me wrong,

4266
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:17,880
I'm glad Spazinator got what he

4267
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:19,880
wanted. He just should have gotten it the first

4268
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:21,880
time. You know, so this is if

4269
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:23,880
we can learn anything from this phone call, if

4270
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:25,880
you are at Sony, there's some

4271
02:31:25,880 --> 02:31:27,880
edumacation to be done amongst

4272
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:29,880
your reps. This is also a

4273
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:31,880
prime example why every time

4274
02:31:31,880 --> 02:31:33,880
you talk to someone in a call center, you write down

4275
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:35,880
their name, you write down the date and the time that you

4276
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:37,880
spoke with them and you keep a track of what

4277
02:31:37,880 --> 02:31:39,880
you talked about. They have to keep notes too.

4278
02:31:39,880 --> 02:31:41,880
Anyway, I know Spazinator... I'm sorry. No, that's okay.

4279
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:43,880
But no, it's important. Spazinator is dying to jump

4280
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:45,880
in here again. Sorry Spaz.

4281
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:47,880
Yeah, I was going to say,

4282
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:49,880
I never worked at a call center before.

4283
02:31:49,880 --> 02:31:51,880
The closest thing to that is working

4284
02:31:51,880 --> 02:31:53,880
at a grocery store, you know,

4285
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:55,880
at the front desk.

4286
02:31:55,880 --> 02:31:57,880
But I basically

4287
02:31:57,880 --> 02:31:59,880
talked about the initial

4288
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:01,880
response I got to like,

4289
02:32:01,880 --> 02:32:03,880
perhaps, you know, the one

4290
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:05,880
rep that I usually spoke to

4291
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:07,880
having an off day,

4292
02:32:07,880 --> 02:32:09,880
you know, every deal with

4293
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:11,880
Apple customers, they weren't

4294
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:13,880
quite as friendly as I was

4295
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:15,880
or maybe possibly

4296
02:32:15,880 --> 02:32:17,880
you know,

4297
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:19,880
the rep

4298
02:32:19,880 --> 02:32:21,880
possibly having some kind of

4299
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:23,880
bad information or gainer

4300
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:25,880
information mixed up somehow.

4301
02:32:25,880 --> 02:32:27,880
But ultimately, regardless

4302
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:29,880
of, you know, what the case

4303
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:31,880
may be, you know, ultimately

4304
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:33,880
I got my stuff back, which is

4305
02:32:33,880 --> 02:32:35,880
the key thing there.

4306
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:37,880
So, you know,

4307
02:32:37,880 --> 02:32:39,880
if, God forbid,

4308
02:32:39,880 --> 02:32:41,880
I kept gaining the same

4309
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:43,880
response time and time again,

4310
02:32:43,880 --> 02:32:45,880
then I would, you know,

4311
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:47,880
escalate the call to

4312
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:49,880
a supervisor like U3

4313
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:51,880
has suggested

4314
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:53,880
the first time this kind of

4315
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:55,880
thing happened.

4316
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:57,880
So basically you didn't come to that, but,

4317
02:32:57,880 --> 02:32:59,880
you know,

4318
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:01,880
God forbid it.

4319
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:03,880
Yeah, no, I was just going to say, yay Sony

4320
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:05,880
for getting it right, but, you know,

4321
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:07,880
it is a bummer that it did take you

4322
02:33:07,880 --> 02:33:09,880
a little bit of a run around to do it, but, you know,

4323
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:11,880
they made it right and we should recognize

4324
02:33:11,880 --> 02:33:13,880
that, you know, at least it wasn't the doom and gloom

4325
02:33:13,880 --> 02:33:15,880
we thought it was going to be. But I'm

4326
02:33:15,880 --> 02:33:17,880
fascinated. I got to wrap up because we got to see if we can

4327
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:19,880
fit in one or two more calls. Do you have anything else

4328
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:21,880
or a footnote to this or anything else you want to share with

4329
02:33:21,880 --> 02:33:23,880
listeners?

4330
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:25,880
Nothing comes to mind, but I'll keep

4331
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:27,880
you guys posted on

4332
02:33:27,880 --> 02:33:29,880
Twitter if there's anything that comes up

4333
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:31,880
or if I think anything

4334
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:33,880
early during the week.

4335
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:35,880
Sounds good buddy.

4336
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:37,880
Alright, good luck with everything. Take care

4337
02:33:37,880 --> 02:33:39,880
buddy.

4338
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:41,880
I just got to read this comment from chat, which is interesting.

4339
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:43,880
SHA100Matt says, I'll say this again,

4340
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:45,880
buy and have hard copies of your movies

4341
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:47,880
from now on. This is the second time that's happened

4342
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:49,880
and if you ask me it's totally not worth it going through this

4343
02:33:49,880 --> 02:33:51,880
hassle. You know,

4344
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:53,880
it's tough because there's a lot about digital

4345
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:55,880
distribution I do want to support, but you know,

4346
02:33:55,880 --> 02:33:57,880
SHA100Matt makes a good point. It's like

4347
02:33:57,880 --> 02:33:59,880
if there were hard copies, you wouldn't have had to

4348
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:01,880
go through this in the first place, but

4349
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:03,880
I don't know.

4350
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:05,880
I don't know. I'm kind of torn because like, you know,

4351
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:07,880
I've bought things online. I've done the digital

4352
02:34:07,880 --> 02:34:09,880
distribution thing, but I've kind of taken

4353
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:11,880
a lot of that for granted maybe. Alright.

4354
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:13,880
I just buy TV episodes sometimes online, like

4355
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:15,880
if I'm buying on Supernatural. That's why I like

4356
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:17,880
Netflix because Netflix, you know, you're not really

4357
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:19,880
buying anything. You just kind of rent it.

4358
02:34:19,880 --> 02:34:21,880
Anyhow, let's do at least one more call here and then we're going to be on our way out.

4359
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:23,880
Hey, Aaron Orange on the radio. Who's this?

4360
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:25,880
Hi. This is your friendly neighborhood

4361
02:34:25,880 --> 02:34:27,880
Mexican. Act Deaf. Hey, Act Deaf.

4362
02:34:27,880 --> 02:34:29,880
I'm glad to see you weren't shaken

4363
02:34:29,880 --> 02:34:31,880
too bad by the earthquake that happened last

4364
02:34:31,880 --> 02:34:33,880
week right before the show.

4365
02:34:33,880 --> 02:34:35,880
Yeah, we were shaken, but

4366
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:37,880
not stirred. Not stirred. Alright.

4367
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:39,880
Well said. What's

4368
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:41,880
on your mind tonight, buddy?

4369
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:43,880
I just wanted to add about

4370
02:34:43,880 --> 02:34:45,880
the Twitter topic I sent

4371
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:47,880
earlier about the Mexican

4372
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:49,880
game being

4373
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:51,880
developed and brought over

4374
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:53,880
by Konami.

4375
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:55,880
I just wanted to add that

4376
02:34:55,880 --> 02:34:57,880
it's being distributed here

4377
02:34:57,880 --> 02:34:59,880
in Mexico, but it's

4378
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:01,880
being distributed by another company.

4379
02:35:01,880 --> 02:35:03,880
Okay, well that's good to know

4380
02:35:03,880 --> 02:35:05,880
because I think earlier I had said, oh haha, it's not

4381
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,880
coming out of Mexico even though it's a Mexican game, but

4382
02:35:07,880 --> 02:35:09,880
that's just, Konami's not

4383
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:11,880
putting it out there. Someone else is. Okay, that makes sense.

4384
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:13,880
Yeah, it's actually made by

4385
02:35:13,880 --> 02:35:15,880
Colombian and Mexican

4386
02:35:15,880 --> 02:35:17,880
developers. It's being published

4387
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:19,880
I think by

4388
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:21,880
well, developed by

4389
02:35:21,880 --> 02:35:23,880
well, the

4390
02:35:23,880 --> 02:35:25,880
sorry.

4391
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:27,880
The main development is being held

4392
02:35:27,880 --> 02:35:29,880
here in Mexico, though Colombia is

4393
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:31,880
helping also over their

4394
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:33,880
studios. I don't remember

4395
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:35,880
the name of the development company, but

4396
02:35:35,880 --> 02:35:37,880
it's just starting

4397
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:39,880
right now to develop games

4398
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:41,880
and I hope, I really hope that

4399
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:43,880
this game

4400
02:35:43,880 --> 02:35:45,880
at least develops or

4401
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:47,880
brings a market over Mexico

4402
02:35:47,880 --> 02:35:49,880
because it's a

4403
02:35:49,880 --> 02:35:51,880
very small market and it's

4404
02:35:51,880 --> 02:35:53,880
starting right now.

4405
02:35:53,880 --> 02:35:55,880
I was going to say, I can't say

4406
02:35:55,880 --> 02:35:57,880
and maybe you can correct me here, but I can't say I can

4407
02:35:57,880 --> 02:35:59,880
think of any like big games or even

4408
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:01,880
medium sized games that we can say

4409
02:36:01,880 --> 02:36:03,880
this game was developed in Mexico by

4410
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:05,880
a Mexican company or

4411
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:07,880
Colombia or any of these other places.

4412
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:09,880
This seems to be like the first game we're really

4413
02:36:09,880 --> 02:36:11,880
at least that I'm aware of

4414
02:36:11,880 --> 02:36:13,880
that is developed like that.

4415
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:15,880
Yeah, there's not

4416
02:36:15,880 --> 02:36:17,880
really a market for like

4417
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:19,880
Xbox 360 or PS3

4418
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:21,880
games, maybe even Wii games

4419
02:36:21,880 --> 02:36:23,880
that are developed

4420
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:25,880
at least this large.

4421
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:27,880
There may be cell phone games

4422
02:36:27,880 --> 02:36:29,880
that are being developed here

4423
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:31,880
and are made by companies like

4424
02:36:31,880 --> 02:36:33,880
Gameloft and other

4425
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:35,880
companies, but

4426
02:36:35,880 --> 02:36:37,880
for a console

4427
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:39,880
it's pretty much the first.

4428
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:41,880
There are

4429
02:36:41,880 --> 02:36:43,880
games coming out for

4430
02:36:43,880 --> 02:36:45,880
the Wii and the 360

4431
02:36:45,880 --> 02:36:47,880
that are also

4432
02:36:47,880 --> 02:36:49,880
based on Mexican

4433
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:51,880
franchises like

4434
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,880
soap opera even,

4435
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:55,880
but at least it's starting to

4436
02:36:55,880 --> 02:36:57,880
grow. Do you see PS2 development?

4437
02:36:57,880 --> 02:36:59,880
Because my thought would be that a lot of these countries

4438
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:01,880
that they're not really being supported

4439
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:03,880
with the 360 and PS3, it seems that maybe

4440
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:05,880
the PS2 is still big there.

4441
02:37:05,880 --> 02:37:07,880
Actually,

4442
02:37:07,880 --> 02:37:09,880
the PS2 isn't

4443
02:37:09,880 --> 02:37:11,880
that big right now.

4444
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:13,880
It's maybe the PS3 or

4445
02:37:13,880 --> 02:37:15,880
the 360 maybe.

4446
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:17,880
Maybe on other places

4447
02:37:17,880 --> 02:37:19,880
like Brazil

4448
02:37:19,880 --> 02:37:21,880
and especially

4449
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:23,880
because of their import

4450
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:25,880
and taxes over there,

4451
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:27,880
the PS2 is starting to gain

4452
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:29,880
momentum there, but

4453
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:31,880
here, even though

4454
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:33,880
the games, and I have talked about this before,

4455
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:35,880
the games are pretty expensive, but

4456
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:37,880
at least we're on the

4457
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:39,880
same market as America.

4458
02:37:39,880 --> 02:37:41,880
You mentioned

4459
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:43,880
Brazil and the first thing I thought of was

4460
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:45,880
I thought the Master System was still big in Brazil.

4461
02:37:45,880 --> 02:37:47,880
Yeah, it's still big.

4462
02:37:47,880 --> 02:37:49,880
It's like, whoa.

4463
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:51,880
They also have the re-releases. Didn't we have a story

4464
02:37:51,880 --> 02:37:53,880
about the Genesis repackaging that was coming

4465
02:37:53,880 --> 02:37:55,880
out in Brazil? There's some

4466
02:37:55,880 --> 02:37:57,880
interesting things going on with old school games

4467
02:37:57,880 --> 02:37:59,880
in Latin America.

4468
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:01,880
If I recall correctly, it's called

4469
02:38:01,880 --> 02:38:03,880
the Bebo.

4470
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:05,880
It was brought over here

4471
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:07,880
in Mexico, though it didn't.

4472
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:09,880
It wasn't as big

4473
02:38:09,880 --> 02:38:11,880
as in Brazil. Interesting.

4474
02:38:11,880 --> 02:38:13,880
Cool stuff. Well, we hope

4475
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:15,880
the game does well. I know

4476
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:17,880
it's probably not going to be a huge thing

4477
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:19,880
here, but I know there's a lot of people that are

4478
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:21,880
really into that Mexican wrestling stuff and

4479
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:23,880
just like there are the WWE

4480
02:38:23,880 --> 02:38:25,880
and all that stuff, so I'm sure

4481
02:38:25,880 --> 02:38:27,880
it will definitely have its audience.

4482
02:38:27,880 --> 02:38:29,880
It doesn't look that bad.

4483
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:31,880
It looks decent.

4484
02:38:31,880 --> 02:38:33,880
I totally love Mexican wrestling.

4485
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:35,880
I've played some of the WWE games, and

4486
02:38:35,880 --> 02:38:37,880
they look good, and it looks

4487
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:39,880
at the same part.

4488
02:38:39,880 --> 02:38:41,880
Alright, well, we'll see. We'll hope it does well.

4489
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:43,880
At least if nothing else, it'll help the

4490
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:45,880
development market down there and get some more

4491
02:38:45,880 --> 02:38:47,880
games out of there of some ideas.

4492
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:49,880
Anything else you want to share with the listeners

4493
02:38:49,880 --> 02:38:51,880
real quick tonight, ACT-F?

4494
02:38:51,880 --> 02:38:53,880
Well, only that

4495
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:55,880
we're okay over here in

4496
02:38:55,880 --> 02:38:57,880
Nezcali. Even though it

4497
02:38:57,880 --> 02:38:59,880
was a pretty big quake, there was

4498
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:01,880
only pretty much

4499
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:03,880
structural damages.

4500
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:05,880
There were only two lives lost

4501
02:39:05,880 --> 02:39:07,880
and only a couple

4502
02:39:07,880 --> 02:39:09,880
hundred injuries, but

4503
02:39:09,880 --> 02:39:11,880
other

4504
02:39:11,880 --> 02:39:13,880
than that, we're pretty fine over here,

4505
02:39:13,880 --> 02:39:15,880
though there are people that

4506
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:17,880
are needed

4507
02:39:17,880 --> 02:39:19,880
of services and maybe

4508
02:39:19,880 --> 02:39:21,880
like camping tents

4509
02:39:21,880 --> 02:39:23,880
and all that stuff, but

4510
02:39:25,880 --> 02:39:27,880
other than that, we're pretty

4511
02:39:27,880 --> 02:39:29,880
good. Hopefully,

4512
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:31,880
at least here in America,

4513
02:39:31,880 --> 02:39:33,880
the folks want to donate to

4514
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:35,880
the relief efforts. I'm sure

4515
02:39:35,880 --> 02:39:37,880
the Red Cross has something set up. They always do

4516
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:39,880
for the cases like this, so definitely

4517
02:39:39,880 --> 02:39:41,880
folks should look into that. I'm glad

4518
02:39:41,880 --> 02:39:43,880
to hear that for the most part, everything's okay.

4519
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:45,880
It's sad

4520
02:39:45,880 --> 02:39:47,880
that even one life was lost, but

4521
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:49,880
it sounds like it could have been a lot

4522
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:51,880
worse based on how bad

4523
02:39:51,880 --> 02:39:53,880
the quake itself was, so

4524
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:55,880
I'm glad to hear that at least

4525
02:39:55,880 --> 02:39:57,880
you and everyone you care

4526
02:39:57,880 --> 02:39:59,880
about are okay.

4527
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:01,880
All right, well, Act F, we're

4528
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:03,880
going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call, okay?

4529
02:40:03,880 --> 02:40:05,880
Thank you. All right, take care, my friend.

4530
02:40:05,880 --> 02:40:07,880
All right,

4531
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:09,880
that's going to do it for tonight's calls, and sorry

4532
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:11,880
for those folks that didn't get through.

4533
02:40:11,880 --> 02:40:13,880
It was ringing pretty good tonight because

4534
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:15,880
we actually had

4535
02:40:15,880 --> 02:40:17,880
a lot of people that were trying to get in

4536
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:19,880
tonight because of last week, but

4537
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:21,880
yeah, we've got to wrap it up, you guys.

4538
02:40:21,880 --> 02:40:23,880
I'm starting

4539
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:25,880
a new job tomorrow. I can't be here all night,

4540
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:27,880
and you know, Dark Soccer wants to go to bed

4541
02:40:27,880 --> 02:40:29,880
eventually, and Matt might

4542
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:31,880
want to go back to KFC and ask for a double down

4543
02:40:31,880 --> 02:40:33,880
with no sauce, so we'll see.

4544
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:35,880
All right. I'm kind of hungry because I didn't

4545
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:37,880
need anything. I offered to make ribs.

4546
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:39,880
You can have cake. I don't need ribs.

4547
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:41,880
I'm going to have healthy special

4548
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:43,880
K cereal when I go home. All right.

4549
02:40:43,880 --> 02:40:45,880
Anyhow, we've got to wrap

4550
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:47,880
up, you guys, and get on out of here

4551
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:49,880
so we can. Ooh, or a baked potato. I'm going to have

4552
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:51,880
a baked potato.

4553
02:40:51,880 --> 02:40:53,880
All right. We've got to, uh-oh.

4554
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:55,880
Uh-oh. We have a stream

4555
02:40:55,880 --> 02:40:57,880
down error. Winamp has crashed.

4556
02:40:57,880 --> 02:40:59,880
God dammit.

4557
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:01,880
All right. That's okay. We're going to just keep going here.

4558
02:41:01,880 --> 02:41:03,880
At least it's at the end of the show.

4559
02:41:03,880 --> 02:41:05,880
Yeah, at least it's at the end of the show.

4560
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:07,880
Hold on, guys. Dang it.

4561
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:09,880
Poopy!

4562
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:11,880
All right. We're still recording for podcasts,

4563
02:41:11,880 --> 02:41:13,880
so can someone fill a little time here

4564
02:41:13,880 --> 02:41:15,880
while I get us... I'm actually trying to find something to send

4565
02:41:15,880 --> 02:41:17,880
you for cage match. Okay, that's fine.

4566
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:19,880
And, um...

4567
02:41:19,880 --> 02:41:21,880
I had the same problem, but then I found something.

4568
02:41:21,880 --> 02:41:23,880
Well, I was

4569
02:41:23,880 --> 02:41:25,880
going to... Who was the winning song last time?

4570
02:41:25,880 --> 02:41:27,880
That would be, I think, you, Rob.

4571
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:29,880
Was I with the Goldfrapp song? It wasn't me.

4572
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:31,880
Yeah, you were with the Goldfrapp song. Okay, that's fine.

4573
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:33,880
So I was going to do, like, a throwaway.

4574
02:41:33,880 --> 02:41:35,880
Okay, there we go. So we're still going.

4575
02:41:35,880 --> 02:41:37,880
Now we're back up, and it's streaming on all games again.

4576
02:41:37,880 --> 02:41:39,880
I don't know what happened. So, okay.

4577
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:41,880
Now we can actually wrap up the show. Winamp froze,

4578
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:43,880
you guys. I don't know why it does that.

4579
02:41:43,880 --> 02:41:45,880
It's irritating. Because it's Winamp.

4580
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:47,880
I guess. I mean, it might need to upgrade the version

4581
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:49,880
or something. We'll have to run some tests.

4582
02:41:49,880 --> 02:41:51,880
You need to upgrade your version.

4583
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:53,880
We'll have to run some tests before the next show, I don't know.

4584
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:55,880
But that's weird, because just closing

4585
02:41:55,880 --> 02:41:57,880
Skype shouldn't bork Winamp like that.

4586
02:41:57,880 --> 02:41:59,880
I don't know what happened. Alright, well

4587
02:41:59,880 --> 02:42:01,880
it is what it is. Anyhow, um...

4588
02:42:01,880 --> 02:42:03,880
We're still going to wrap up

4589
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:05,880
and be on out of here for the night.

4590
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:07,880
Thanks so much for our Skype callers. Thank you guys

4591
02:42:07,880 --> 02:42:09,880
for listening to our show and supporting our

4592
02:42:09,880 --> 02:42:11,880
independent radio. I gotta get

4593
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:13,880
last minute stories, though, before I give my whole spiel here.

4594
02:42:13,880 --> 02:42:15,880
It looks like Matt has a million tabs open on

4595
02:42:15,880 --> 02:42:17,880
Firefox over there. Yes, I do.

4596
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:19,880
A million instances of the Unicorn game.

4597
02:42:19,880 --> 02:42:21,880
DarkSire, do you have any last minute stories

4598
02:42:21,880 --> 02:42:23,880
real quick before we go?

4599
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:25,880
Rawr. I just want to check.

4600
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:27,880
Alright, Loki then.

4601
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:29,880
Ok, so Dark Void Zero, that

4602
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:31,880
wonderful 2D version

4603
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:33,880
of, or 8-bit 2D version

4604
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:35,880
of the game Dark Zero

4605
02:42:35,880 --> 02:42:37,880
that hit the DSiWare

4606
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:39,880
is now going to be hitting the iPhone

4607
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:41,880
and PC actually tomorrow.

4608
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:43,880
So that's pretty awesome.

4609
02:42:43,880 --> 02:42:45,880
And it'll cost you $2.99

4610
02:42:45,880 --> 02:42:47,880
on the iPhone and $5 on PC.

4611
02:42:47,880 --> 02:42:49,880
So that's not bad. I actually may purchase that for my

4612
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:51,880
arcade cabinet. I think that would fit in just

4613
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:53,880
nice and easy.

4614
02:42:53,880 --> 02:42:55,880
And a game that I was playing earlier

4615
02:42:55,880 --> 02:42:57,880
this week.

4616
02:42:57,880 --> 02:42:59,880
I always had trouble pronouncing this.

4617
02:42:59,880 --> 02:43:01,880
Espacaluda 2

4618
02:43:01,880 --> 02:43:03,880
will be hitting the iPhone as well.

4619
02:43:03,880 --> 02:43:05,880
Also, actually

4620
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:07,880
it should have already hit the iPhone because that would have been

4621
02:43:07,880 --> 02:43:09,880
on the 10th.

4622
02:43:09,880 --> 02:43:11,880
That's awesome.

4623
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:13,880
My friend linked

4624
02:43:13,880 --> 02:43:15,880
a Japanese video of that in and I

4625
02:43:15,880 --> 02:43:17,880
was actually already looking for it.

4626
02:43:17,880 --> 02:43:19,880
But I don't know that...

4627
02:43:19,880 --> 02:43:21,880
I don't know how well I controlled it on the iPhone.

4628
02:43:21,880 --> 02:43:23,880
It looked pretty responsive

4629
02:43:23,880 --> 02:43:25,880
on that video. So I'm totally thinking

4630
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:27,880
about getting it.

4631
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:29,880
Very cool.

4632
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:31,880
Let's see here. And then

4633
02:43:31,880 --> 02:43:33,880
there's some interesting

4634
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:35,880
tie-ins apparently with Melgir Solid

4635
02:43:35,880 --> 02:43:37,880
Peace Walker.

4636
02:43:37,880 --> 02:43:39,880
They're going to have two different games

4637
02:43:39,880 --> 02:43:41,880
tie-in with it. First one, Monster Hunter

4638
02:43:41,880 --> 02:43:43,880
is actually

4639
02:43:43,880 --> 02:43:45,880
going to be tie-in with it as well.

4640
02:43:45,880 --> 02:43:47,880
Monster Hunter Portable 2nd-G

4641
02:43:47,880 --> 02:43:49,880
I guess

4642
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:51,880
there's going to be content from that game

4643
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:53,880
that's going to be able to

4644
02:43:53,880 --> 02:43:55,880
work with Peace Walker

4645
02:43:55,880 --> 02:43:57,880
which is weird.

4646
02:43:57,880 --> 02:43:59,880
Apparently the little

4647
02:43:59,880 --> 02:44:01,880
cat-like characters

4648
02:44:01,880 --> 02:44:03,880
the felines

4649
02:44:03,880 --> 02:44:05,880
that appear in the Monster Hunter series

4650
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:07,880
are going to appear

4651
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:09,880
in the Melgir Solid Peace Walker

4652
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:11,880
game as well.

4653
02:44:11,880 --> 02:44:13,880
So that's interesting.

4654
02:44:13,880 --> 02:44:15,880
And then another weird one

4655
02:44:15,880 --> 02:44:17,880
that's a crossover. Apparently

4656
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:19,880
you will also be able to link up

4657
02:44:19,880 --> 02:44:21,880
Melgir Solid

4658
02:44:21,880 --> 02:44:23,880
Peace Walker with

4659
02:44:23,880 --> 02:44:25,880
Front Mission Evolved

4660
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:27,880
on the Playstation 3 and

4661
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:29,880
Xbox 360. Players will be able

4662
02:44:29,880 --> 02:44:31,880
to exchange parts acquired from

4663
02:44:31,880 --> 02:44:33,880
Peace Walker bosses

4664
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:35,880
in Front Mission Evolved.

4665
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:37,880
How the hell does that work?

4666
02:44:37,880 --> 02:44:39,880
But that's interesting.

4667
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:41,880
And you can use them for your

4668
02:44:41,880 --> 02:44:43,880
mechs that you build in that game.

4669
02:44:43,880 --> 02:44:45,880
Talk about cross-company

4670
02:44:45,880 --> 02:44:47,880
promotions there. That's kind of neat

4671
02:44:47,880 --> 02:44:49,880
actually. I actually want to

4672
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:51,880
check out that new Peace Walker game.

4673
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:53,880
Or Front Mission.

4674
02:44:53,880 --> 02:44:55,880
And then Professor Layton

4675
02:44:55,880 --> 02:44:57,880
is actually coming over here. It's getting a Western

4676
02:44:57,880 --> 02:44:59,880
release. The movie that is

4677
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:01,880
developed by

4678
02:45:01,880 --> 02:45:03,880
Level 5 and

4679
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:05,880
that looks kind of neat.

4680
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:07,880
An anime movie.

4681
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:09,880
People will dig that.

4682
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:11,880
And of course with any

4683
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:13,880
game out there with voluptuous

4684
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:15,880
women, there will be

4685
02:45:15,880 --> 02:45:17,880
a way that they will find to strip them

4686
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:19,880
of their clothes. And

4687
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:21,880
that was the

4688
02:45:21,880 --> 02:45:23,880
exact thing that happened

4689
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:25,880
with Dead or Alive Paradise.

4690
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:27,880
People have found a way to

4691
02:45:27,880 --> 02:45:29,880
swap out the

4692
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:31,880
textures in the game and now we get

4693
02:45:31,880 --> 02:45:33,880
wonderful, nippleous,

4694
02:45:33,880 --> 02:45:35,880
naked women. I'm sure it wasn't very hard with a

4695
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:37,880
Dead or Alive game. So yeah, that game is

4696
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:39,880
five bucks on iTunes and I'm buying it right now.

4697
02:45:39,880 --> 02:45:41,880
Espagluta?

4698
02:45:41,880 --> 02:45:43,880
Yes.

4699
02:45:43,880 --> 02:45:45,880
Good luck controlling it on the iPhone.

4700
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:47,880
Just not my favorite

4701
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:49,880
gaming platform.

4702
02:45:49,880 --> 02:45:51,880
And then finally, there was a patent

4703
02:45:51,880 --> 02:45:53,880
file for Rumble

4704
02:45:53,880 --> 02:45:55,880
in DS. I'm assuming

4705
02:45:55,880 --> 02:45:57,880
it's going to be in the 3DS.

4706
02:45:57,880 --> 02:45:59,880
Oh, I'm sure. Yeah, I think there's been

4707
02:45:59,880 --> 02:46:01,880
rumblings of Rumble for quite some time.

4708
02:46:01,880 --> 02:46:03,880
Yeah.

4709
02:46:03,880 --> 02:46:05,880
And hopefully dual analog sticks would be

4710
02:46:05,880 --> 02:46:07,880
nice. It would be great.

4711
02:46:07,880 --> 02:46:09,880
Because everybody likes dual analog sticks.

4712
02:46:09,880 --> 02:46:11,880
I'm not going to hold my breath though.

4713
02:46:11,880 --> 02:46:13,880
I got a couple things thrown at me here in chat.

4714
02:46:13,880 --> 02:46:15,880
SSG100Matt reminded

4715
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:17,880
me that I don't think we ever mentioned the winner

4716
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:19,880
of USL Madness or

4717
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:21,880
the March Madness, if you will, that happens

4718
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:23,880
on Orange on its Radio. I think we were off the week it

4719
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:25,880
ended and then of course last week's show was just

4720
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:27,880
off. Chrono Trigger

4721
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:29,880
1 for the first time

4722
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:31,880
was the declared the greatest game of all time

4723
02:46:31,880 --> 02:46:33,880
by your voting

4724
02:46:33,880 --> 02:46:35,880
at OrangeOnitsRadio.com. I

4725
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:37,880
thoroughly disagree with your votes

4726
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:39,880
but whatever. I mean it's not like Chrono Trigger is a bad game.

4727
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:41,880
But I guess it was destined to win one of

4728
02:46:41,880 --> 02:46:43,880
these years. I've just decided

4729
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:45,880
in these contests, people just vote the way

4730
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:47,880
I don't vote.

4731
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:49,880
And I don't know if it's a ha ha

4732
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:51,880
let's make Rob mad or whatever, but whatever.

4733
02:46:51,880 --> 02:46:53,880
I can think of a lot of games

4734
02:46:53,880 --> 02:46:55,880
a lot of games worse than

4735
02:46:55,880 --> 02:46:57,880
Chrono Trigger. Yay Chrono Trigger

4736
02:46:57,880 --> 02:46:59,880
and yay everybody that participated in

4737
02:46:59,880 --> 02:47:01,880
boo and poop on those that didn't.

4738
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:03,880
And also as Tigerclaw points out Microsoft

4739
02:47:03,880 --> 02:47:05,880
has changed the increments of which you have to

4740
02:47:05,880 --> 02:47:07,880
purchase Microsoft points to more

4741
02:47:07,880 --> 02:47:09,880
manageable numbers

4742
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:11,880
instead of some weird rounded off numbers.

4743
02:47:11,880 --> 02:47:13,880
It's actually four hundred and eight hundred

4744
02:47:13,880 --> 02:47:15,880
and sixteen hundred and four thousand.

4745
02:47:15,880 --> 02:47:17,880
Is it really? Yes. I'd heard that they were doing

4746
02:47:17,880 --> 02:47:19,880
that so they got rid of five hundred one thousand

4747
02:47:19,880 --> 02:47:21,880
and all that all together? Yeah.

4748
02:47:21,880 --> 02:47:23,880
Well shit, now what if I have extra points I want to use?

4749
02:47:23,880 --> 02:47:25,880
Am I screwed?

4750
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:27,880
It's like go get a card at the store?

4751
02:47:27,880 --> 02:47:29,880
I don't know. Tigerclaw

4752
02:47:29,880 --> 02:47:31,880
is cut and paste in tons of links for us.

4753
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:33,880
He also posted a link that I think is worth mentioning.

4754
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:35,880
Blockbuster, you know Blockbuster

4755
02:47:35,880 --> 02:47:37,880
is kind of hurting right now. They're closing stores left

4756
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:39,880
and right. One of the things they're trying to

4757
02:47:39,880 --> 02:47:41,880
do to, I guess you could say either compete

4758
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:43,880
with Netflix or Gamefly or both.

4759
02:47:43,880 --> 02:47:45,880
They are doing their games

4760
02:47:45,880 --> 02:47:47,880
by mail service. It's going to

4761
02:47:47,880 --> 02:47:49,880
cost an extra seven ninety nine

4762
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:51,880
plus tax on top of the standard

4763
02:47:51,880 --> 02:47:53,880
I guess you could say monthly fees.

4764
02:47:53,880 --> 02:47:55,880
You'll be able to rent one game

4765
02:47:55,880 --> 02:47:57,880
at a time and that's the total number

4766
02:47:57,880 --> 02:47:59,880
of discs that you're allowed to have out on the plan.

4767
02:47:59,880 --> 02:48:01,880
So there you go. If you don't check

4768
02:48:01,880 --> 02:48:03,880
any games out during the one month period though

4769
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:05,880
you're not charged the money. Kind of interesting

4770
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:07,880
how that all works. It's currently being

4771
02:48:07,880 --> 02:48:09,880
tested in Cleveland, Ohio.

4772
02:48:09,880 --> 02:48:11,880
Because Cleveland rocks.

4773
02:48:11,880 --> 02:48:13,880
Cleveland rocks. Ohio.

4774
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:15,880
I'm thinking actually

4775
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:17,880
you say that I think of Howard the Duck.

4776
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:19,880
You live in Cleveland.

4777
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:21,880
Drew Carey show.

4778
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:23,880
I don't watch that.

4779
02:48:23,880 --> 02:48:25,880
It was like ten years ago.

4780
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:27,880
I didn't watch that.

4781
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:29,880
They even had a Rocky Horror themed episode.

4782
02:48:29,880 --> 02:48:31,880
I did see that.

4783
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:33,880
Well, see. Wait, how did you not watch the show

4784
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:35,880
yet? See that episode. I saw the clip

4785
02:48:35,880 --> 02:48:37,880
on YouTube. Yeah, YouTube. YouTube

4786
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:39,880
it ruins everything. Alright.

4787
02:48:39,880 --> 02:48:41,880
Anyhow, I think we're done. Is that it?

4788
02:48:41,880 --> 02:48:43,880
Did you get all your stories, Logie?

4789
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:45,880
Yeah, all the ones I wanted to.

4790
02:48:45,880 --> 02:48:47,880
Some guy beat some Asteroids record too.

4791
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:49,880
Hey now, don't haze

4792
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:51,880
Tiger Claw in chat.

4793
02:48:51,880 --> 02:48:53,880
This is the Tiger Claw link show.

4794
02:48:53,880 --> 02:48:55,880
He does a good job. Act F says Tiger Claw

4795
02:48:55,880 --> 02:48:57,880
more efficient than Google. Seriously.

4796
02:48:57,880 --> 02:48:59,880
And Dan Mufroga Returns is apparently

4797
02:48:59,880 --> 02:49:01,880
popping up on DSiWare as well.

4798
02:49:01,880 --> 02:49:03,880
Cannot die.

4799
02:49:03,880 --> 02:49:05,880
Cannot die. This is why I like

4800
02:49:05,880 --> 02:49:07,880
doing a show with a live chat room because when

4801
02:49:07,880 --> 02:49:09,880
I don't know the answer instead of sitting here looking like an idiot

4802
02:49:09,880 --> 02:49:11,880
or making something up. I mean I still look like an idiot.

4803
02:49:11,880 --> 02:49:13,880
But I'll just go, hey chat, what was

4804
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:15,880
the answer to that? Somebody always knows.

4805
02:49:15,880 --> 02:49:17,880
And if it involves a link, Tiger Claw has it

4806
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:19,880
in five seconds. If not, SSA 100

4807
02:49:19,880 --> 02:49:21,880
Matt. It's like a little friendly competition.

4808
02:49:21,880 --> 02:49:23,880
We should have a total board.

4809
02:49:23,880 --> 02:49:25,880
Or something.

4810
02:49:25,880 --> 02:49:27,880
Alright, anyhow.

4811
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:29,880
Of course, thank you guys so much. All the chatters

4812
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:31,880
that help make the show happen. You guys really are

4813
02:49:31,880 --> 02:49:33,880
the fourth guest on the show always.

4814
02:49:33,880 --> 02:49:35,880
And of course, you guys for listening. I know we have a lot

4815
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:37,880
of people on the podcast who just can't be here for

4816
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:39,880
whatever reason Sunday night. So thank you guys so much

4817
02:49:39,880 --> 02:49:41,880
for downloading our show and tuning in and supporting

4818
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:43,880
independent radio. You guys are awesome.

4819
02:49:43,880 --> 02:49:45,880
And thanks so much. Always say

4820
02:49:45,880 --> 02:49:47,880
if you enjoy the show, just tell somebody

4821
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:49,880
about the show.

4822
02:49:49,880 --> 02:49:51,880
Or leave a nice review on iTunes or

4823
02:49:51,880 --> 02:49:53,880
some other podcast site. Just help us spread the word

4824
02:49:53,880 --> 02:49:55,880
because we don't have a big magazine

4825
02:49:55,880 --> 02:49:57,880
or a big million dollar website or game

4826
02:49:57,880 --> 02:49:59,880
company behind us. We're just

4827
02:49:59,880 --> 02:50:01,880
kids like you that like video games.

4828
02:50:01,880 --> 02:50:03,880
Except we're not kids anymore.

4829
02:50:03,880 --> 02:50:05,880
That's the sad part.

4830
02:50:05,880 --> 02:50:07,880
Anyhow, that's going to do it for another episode of

4831
02:50:07,880 --> 02:50:09,880
Orange Lounge Radio. But not until we go around to get everybody's

4832
02:50:09,880 --> 02:50:11,880
final thought. DarkSakura, do you have

4833
02:50:11,880 --> 02:50:13,880
a final thought for us tonight?

4834
02:50:13,880 --> 02:50:15,880
Meh. Cake!

4835
02:50:15,880 --> 02:50:17,880
Loki, do you have a final thought

4836
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:19,880
for us tonight? I'm hoping to finish Final Fantasy

4837
02:50:19,880 --> 02:50:21,880
13 soon. Although I have a feeling

4838
02:50:21,880 --> 02:50:23,880
I'm not going to be able to because I have to get all the

4839
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:25,880
achievements. And I have lots

4840
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:27,880
of games to start playing.

4841
02:50:27,880 --> 02:50:29,880
My final thought

4842
02:50:29,880 --> 02:50:31,880
is the website

4843
02:50:31,880 --> 02:50:33,880
ffxivcore.com

4844
02:50:33,880 --> 02:50:35,880
is making me foam at the mouth.

4845
02:50:35,880 --> 02:50:37,880
That's really what it boils

4846
02:50:37,880 --> 02:50:39,880
down to. Anyhow,

4847
02:50:39,880 --> 02:50:41,880
thank you guys again. Have a great week.

4848
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:43,880
We will be back next week with more

4849
02:50:43,880 --> 02:50:45,880
of Orange Lounge Radio to do this all over

4850
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:47,880
again. New

4851
02:50:47,880 --> 02:50:49,880
stories and all that other stuff.

4852
02:50:49,880 --> 02:50:51,880
But the same old crap that you've

4853
02:50:51,880 --> 02:50:53,880
come to love week to week. We'll

4854
02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:55,880
see you next time here on Orange

4855
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:57,880
Lounge

4856
02:50:57,880 --> 02:50:59,880
Radio.

4857
02:50:59,880 --> 02:51:01,880
Of course it would help if I would have the

4858
02:51:01,880 --> 02:51:03,880
end of the show theme song queued up.

4859
02:51:03,880 --> 02:51:05,880
Because when I don't have that I just

4860
02:51:05,880 --> 02:51:07,880
sit here in silence and it's kind of awkward.

4861
02:51:07,880 --> 02:51:09,880
Much better. Here we go. Good night!

4862
02:51:37,880 --> 02:51:39,880
See you next week!
