14032	24329	Tonight, April 4th, 2010, a theft occurs at PAX East, Linux gets taken away on the PS3, and Nintendo puts the smackdown on the MMO fans were waiting for.
31775	32135	DarkSakura.com
49174	49734	I know, right?
49934	51196	We'll get into that later.
51976	52777	It's not a good night.
52797	54699	Seriously, we should just phone tonight's episode in.
55279	56020	What the hell are we doing?
56060	59503	We should just throw the show roll in the toilet and just do whatever.
59563	65849	If this is the first show you've ever listened to of Orange Lounge Radio, please go back in the iTunes archives and select another.
66870	69212	It's just gonna be one of those nights tonight, I can already tell.
69252	71894	We had the fuck show already, this is the fuck it show.
73155	76237	Not here tonight, sometimes that's some of our best work though, so we'll see what happens.
76297	79680	Not here tonight, Tagmaster Loki, sadly is not here.
80060	85684	I think he's got a holiday dinner thing going on, which is strange because the wife is Jewish, but whatever, there's a dinner.
85804	86785	But it may be his family.
86845	89107	No, I know, I'm pretty sure it is his family.
90208	91729	The man deserves a night off once in a while.
91749	93730	I wonder if Nellie is observing Passover.
94711	95271	I have no idea.
95852	98093	Well, no, she can't be because, yeah, never mind.
98213	98733	Well, anyhow.
99834	105277	And one thing I should say about Loki, you know, I'm sure he wanted to tell you all this on the show, but he posted it on Twitter.
105337	108659	And when I say, you post it on Twitter, CNN can report on it.
108699	109980	So therefore, it's fair game, right?
110660	111601	Nellie is pregnant again.
111741	113722	So congratulations to Loki.
113742	116364	The pictures were kind of scary because I could see bones.
116384	118925	That's what babies look like when they're growing inside of you.
118965	119546	I could see bones.
120206	124910	And just so you guys know, not only is Nellie pregnant, she's, what, about 20 weeks?
125250	128813	I mean, they waited, I mean, understandably, if you don't know what happened before.
128873	130994	They waited until it was a viable pregnancy.
131135	133516	Yes, they wanted to wait this time to say anything.
133596	135738	So she's about 20 weeks along at this point.
135798	136919	I think they already know it's a boy.
137579	137760	Yes.
137820	139301	It's one this time, not 20.
139361	140021	I saw the pee-pee.
140582	141563	So, what's that?
141603	142944	They pointed to the pee-pee on the ultrasound.
142964	143264	Did they?
143484	144165	Oh, okay, yeah.
144205	145045	Nellie would do that.
145085	146746	That's a very Nellie thing to do.
147367	148608	They usually do that at the doctor's.
148628	149489	Look at my kid's penis.
149549	149689	Woo!
150829	154451	The doctors will usually point stuff out on the ultrasound.
155611	156652	I'm going to make you some dinner.
156952	159393	No, but in all seriousness, like a good woman should.
159413	161094	Bite my ass.
161334	163935	Actually, if you want something more disgusting, bite my sinus cavity.
164075	164355	All right.
165576	166036	So great.
166416	168337	I get to monologue with the listeners for a little while.
168357	168917	This should be fun.
168937	170117	No, I'll do my gaming week.
170137	171898	I can hear you from the other room, Rob.
171918	172378	I know you can.
172438	172899	And you'll hear...
174419	176060	I'll talk to the chatters tonight.
176381	177421	I'll talk to the chatters.
177842	178422	Hi, chatters.
178882	182645	So, yes, Loki is chat.orangelandrader.com, by the way, if you want to join our chat room.
183605	188829	There's no Loki here tonight because he's having a nice family dinner, and obviously they have reasons to celebrate, so good for them.
189609	190430	He'll be back next week.
190810	193832	So it's just, right now, it's just you and me, folks.
194473	199056	You and the guys in the chat room, chat.orangelandrader.com, and we'll be opening up the Skype line a little later on.
199456	203519	Now, here's the other part that's, I guess, just hilarious of what's going on right now.
204239	205500	is that I am sick.
205580	207962	You can probably tell my voice sounds a little bit out of it.
208042	211824	And DarkSakura, you can hear her blowing her nose like in China.
212405	214006	Go download Bobby's show from this week.
214526	216607	It sounded like an earthquake going on back there.
218769	220210	Dark, she's screaming at me from the kitchen.
222271	225213	This is like the DarkSakura and Sky are married edition.
225293	226214	What is going on here?
226254	227735	You're yelling at me from the kitchen.
228235	229436	You're cooking me dinner.
234829	243801	Rob is officially my gay husband Rob is my complimentary spouse Can I talk about fist bumping for a minute?
250129	251009	Okay, PAX East.
251970	254750	Ain't no one want to shake my hand at PAX East for whatever reason.
254830	258492	There's a couple people, but I noticed the big thing to do is fist bumping.
258732	261532	That's how people say hello now, is they fist bump.
262613	266034	Surely that's a sign I'm getting old, is that I don't want to fist bump.
266734	268475	Back in my day, we shake hands.
268515	270175	But not when you're sick.
270835	276137	Well, A, I wasn't sick during the con, and B, I already had swine flu in October, so I'm not going to have it again.
276377	277057	I did too.
277577	277877	Oops.
280518	281219	I'm not cooking dinner.
281259	282820	I'll let everyone know what Rob is having.
283320	284301	It's the same thing I'm having.
285242	290545	It's an Ezekiel 4-9 tortilla, so there's no gluten and no yeast in it.
291586	292767	With some garlic hummus.
293367	294288	All this healthy crap.
294308	295168	Baby spinach.
295568	296469	Fresh baby spinach.
296749	298070	The wife's making me eat healthy tonight.
298110	299011	And yogurt cheese.
299531	302013	Because I will say more about this later.
302533	304134	Everyone knows I have digestion problems.
304154	305475	I think I figured out what's causing it.
305839	307121	Alright, that's right.
308223	311147	And Rob in the chatroom says, I got it from the beanbag and shook your hand.
311167	311488	That's true.
311548	313450	No, it was just some people were fist bumping.
313531	315333	Like, I don't... I met a...
317173	324859	I met a blogger who blogs for a site that's commercial and they get paid for it.
324959	326760	And if I told you the site, you'd all know what it is.
327621	329863	And she wanted a fist bump.
330223	332845	And I was like, oh, okay, is that how we do it back east?
332885	336748	But she was actually from California, so I didn't get it.
336788	338469	But I guess maybe it was a virus thing.
338549	338890	I don't know.
339530	340291	It was just weird.
340371	340731	It was weird.
341232	341492	All right.
342513	344134	I wasn't used to that whole fist bump thing.
344174	346315	I thought that's what bros did when they were drunk.
346375	346656	I don't know.
347096	348456	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
365461	369944	Actdeft apparently is okay so I know if he's okay then it can't be too terrible so hopefully everybody is okay
390096	404631	I know they build a lot of the structures down there I mean it's LA we're talking about so there's a lot of structural integrity down there so hopefully everybody's okay what I didn't know at the same time apparently nine minutes later an aftershock of some sort hits in NorCal
405478	406038	Thanks for watching!
423809	425210	I wouldn't have really felt it anyway.
425250	428812	But the scary part is I was sitting on the Bay Bridge right when these earthquakes were happening.
428852	433294	And I know this because my sister, who is in Long Beach, texted me and said, earthquake, LOL.
434074	439117	So thank gosh I didn't like fall off the bridge if that earthquake had been too much stronger.
439237	440038	So there you go.
441578	441919	All right.
443882	444342	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
463920	466461	Okay, apparently it's the earthquake show.
466541	468542	It's the freaky crap show tonight.
468623	470003	I don't know what the hell's going on tonight.
470043	471764	We're just like avoiding the topic of games.
471844	473185	All right, we can talk about games.
473385	474225	Let's get into the show.
474245	477267	Let's start it off as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week.
477687	482510	DarkSakura is still in the kitchen, but she's bringing, ooh, yay, vitamin water.
482570	482870	Thank you.
485011	487652	Now when my throat is parched, I will be able to quench it.
488293	488613	Here we go.
489273	489994	So my gaming week.
491058	491779	Can we touch you, Rob?
515237	516777	No, it wasn't that silly.
516837	517878	But, you know, we had a good time.
517898	518658	We had a good discussion.
518718	519118	It was fun.
519898	521539	You were a miss, DarkSakura, as was Loki.
521559	522859	It was a bummer you guys couldn't make it.
523259	528421	Show itself, I don't know if I really actually ended up playing a lot of video games because I didn't want to wait in line for an hour.
529261	530801	I will say what video games I did play.
530861	532382	Classic Gaming Arcade.
532742	537543	That big famous arcade they have out there in the East Coast.
537643	538663	Fun Spot.
538903	539203	That's it.
539243	541444	Fun Spot brought some of their arcade machines.
541924	542745	Two Packs East.
543346	544628	So I played Donkey Kong 3.
545088	545589	Heck yeah.
545989	546490	I played that.
546530	549153	I took some pictures of pinball tables for DarkSakura on her Twitter.
549634	551836	And I played the Buck Rogers arcade machine.
551916	553238	It was actually one of the sit-down cabinets.
553258	554379	That machine kicked my ass.
554940	556061	So I played some classic games.
556522	557142	But as far as...
558724	559766	I don't like jumping the sequel.
575848	578269	It looked like I like jumping with rockets.
578909	581030	It's just people blast each other with rockets.
581490	582450	But, you know, I had a good time.
582790	586231	I did get DarkSakura a present, but unfortunately I neglected to bring it tonight.
586671	592853	But it involves a certain card game that people were playing everywhere, up and down the halls in the tabletop area.
593493	595054	And I know it's one that DarkSakura is a fan of.
595174	595534	Magic?
596234	596854	I'm not telling.
597755	598315	I'm not telling.
599543	600144	I wish.
600184	603106	That would have been fun.
603646	606188	But I had a good time at PAX.
606648	607769	Except for the Omegathon.
607869	609049	Can we talk about the Omegathon?
609069	610631	Because that happened after the PAX show.
613152	614893	I'm already starting to get sick Sunday.
615053	619476	And my friends that I traveled with, my dear friends Sag and Amanda, they wanted to wait in line for the Omegathon.
619496	622438	Which I'm like, okay, I've never watched a final round Omegathon.
622458	623339	So I'm cool.
623379	624900	I'm like, okay, let's do it.
624940	625580	Let's sit in line.
625621	626961	Let's wait for the final round of the Omegathon.
627001	628983	Let's watch the closing ceremony, see what happens.
629864	632952	So final round of the Omegathon is supposed to start at 5 o'clock, right?
634282	638984	5.30, I noticed we're still sitting in line outside and we are cramped.
639024	640345	We are herded like cattle.
640665	642166	If there was a fire, we would have died.
642566	643286	We would have all died.
643806	646688	I mean, it's just we are in there like so tightly packed.
647028	652670	And apparently they posted to their Twitter, oh, we're having problems with the final Omegathon game, LOL.
652830	656732	And I'm just sitting there thinking, open the goddamn theater and test behind the curtain.
656772	657372	Let us in.
657572	660374	I'm old and my bones can't take this standing around anymore.
660394	662074	So finally, like 5.45, they let us in.
664520	665981	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
688340	692243	Super Mario Brothers, Rad Racer, Tetris, I'm watching the Nintendo World Championships about 20 years late
710333	714138	Actually, that sounds like almost the exact order of a Nintendo World Championship cartridge.
714218	714539	It was.
714759	715300	That's what it was?
715360	715760	For real?
715941	717363	It was, for real.
717663	725073	It might have been some variation in the coin numbers and the lines, but essentially it was the frickin' Nintendo World Championships.
725333	725873	DarkSakura.com
745888	754075	To the, through the little tunnel part and through to the, like the very end.
754555	757778	It wasn't the little dinky guy sitting in front of the gate at the first stage, was it?
757818	759079	No, see, I took it to mean that.
759179	760700	I took it to mean stage one.
760760	763262	That's the first boss is the end of stage one, right?
763322	766344	No, but it was all the way to the big orb thing that goes back and forth.
766424	767846	It's really at the end of like stage two.
768506	769867	So that's how far they had to play.
770187	771689	Well, yippee skippee for that.
771709	772109	Without cussing?
772469	772649	Huh?
772750	773270	Without cussing?
774269	774569	Womp, womp, womp
803942	804322	So yeah.
804762	807604	And then they were like, thanks for coming to watch the Omegathon.
807624	809145	PAX East was awesome.
809205	811106	It was more awesome than PAX Prime.
811486	813347	See you next year, bitches.
813467	813928	And that was it.
814548	819070	And I'm sitting like, I stood in an hour in like 30 minute line for that.
820251	822072	Which I could have read about on the internet in five minutes.
823533	824513	It was very unfortunate.
824593	826675	I hear past Omegathons have been much better.
827295	829936	That was a very unfortunate low light of PAX.
831217	831757	So there you go.
833137	834358	Game Room Game Room
851775	852095	DarkSakura.com
879147	883469	Which is ridiculous when you're trying to get a high score saved or something.
883489	884970	You might have to be hitting the button over and over.
885730	889892	I've lost scores because the servers literally go up and down and up and down and up and down.
890273	892033	It is just atrocious.
892754	894675	So I don't know what is going on with Game Room.
895375	898257	But there's a good Game Room in there somewhere.
899017	901338	It's just they've got a lot of kinks to work out.
901478	907081	Honestly, my gut tells me as much as there's a lot I do like about Game Room, they shouldn't have released it when they did.
907341	910264	They should have waited until things were more stable.
910344	912466	Maybe they had no idea how popular it was going to be.
912646	913047	I don't know.
913367	914909	But I think they should have waited until June.
915289	921635	By the way, pro tip, I find I do better when I play on games for Windows with an Xbox 360 controller than I do on regular Xbox.
924298	944218	and I think part of the reason is that you're sitting right there in front of the monitor just like an old school arcade cabinet you're not sitting several feet away from your TV and I think it does help the precision especially on a lot of those old games especially on things like Asteroid Deluxe where your bullets are like tiny tiny it kind of helps to be sitting right in front of the monitor as much as my mother would hate that
944918	969028	so there you go Spyro in our chatroom says game room is free that is true the game room engine itself is free and you can get like a good like I don't know like 50 gamer score just for downloading it and putting up decorations in your room but you will have to pay at least like $3 to enjoy a game or $5 if you want them to be multi-platform which is how I've been buying all my games but I do go back and forth between Windows and 360 and some people might say $5 Rob you're crazy
969648	977951	But, well, I mean, I paid $5 for Frogger and Joust on the 360 when it first came out, and I've honestly played Yars' Revenge more than any other game this week.
979011	979932	But I did play some other stuff.
979952	982613	On the plane, I played Final Fantasy Tactics A2 on the DS.
983373	983993	I borrowed that game.
984053	984474	It's cool.
984934	985354	It's awesome.
986074	989275	DarkSakura, Oshi who keeps blowing her nose and sinuses over there How is your gaming week going?
1007896	1009417	I just played some Star Trek Online.
1010337	1015621	I've been taking advantage of my spring break to not be at my computer or not be in front of a TV.
1017061	1022364	I just tried to rest a lot, you know, because I've been so busy with everything.
1022565	1028548	And then I was going to actually make a good start on Final Fantasy II today.
1029949	1031890	And then the allergy monster smacked me in the face.
1031950	1035132	So basically every time I haven't been working on something here, I've been asleep.
1035612	1036733	So I've been playing Dream.
1038444	1040561	I've been playing Ben and Joel the game.
1042509	1045991	It's where you take Benadryl and see if it'll either make you high or pass out.
1046011	1050054	In my case, it was pass out, and that's what's happening again because I took another Benadryl.
1050194	1050554	Great.
1050714	1053596	So you took drugs that are going to make you drowsy during the show.
1053616	1059260	I took drugs so that I could breathe, and then Dan gave me a Vicks inhaler thing, and I love those things.
1059340	1061621	It's a tube you stick up your nose and snort.
1061641	1064183	It looks like a tampon applicator, honestly, from where I'm sitting.
1064203	1065004	It looks like a tampon.
1065224	1065644	It does.
1065744	1068446	It looks like you're shoving a tampon in your nose and pushing a button.
1068486	1069567	That's disgusting.
1069587	1070127	Don't do that.
1070668	1071891	Thank God it's radio.
1071952	1074097	This is where all of you in chat are very thankful.
1074238	1075020	I have a camera, Rob.
1078314	1082016	Alright, anyhow, where else was I with this?
1082456	1100125	Talking about webcams and all that stuff Oh, I did want to say this about Rocky last night As I went to Rocky And, well, A, Alan was playing a crap ton of Peggle Which I thought was cute Because it made me think of you That's one time I thought of you last night And then the other time Are you going to put that on the OLR blog?
1100145	1100585	I dare you
1102952	1107937	DarkSakura never likes pictures of herself to get up on the internet, and I dare her to put the tampon in her nose on the internet.
1107957	1109258	I have a reason to look like shit.
1110500	1111601	Are you putting that on the internet?
1112462	1112622	Why not?
1112642	1113142	Oh, I'm happy.
1113263	1113943	All right.
1114203	1115725	DarkSakura with a tampon in her nose.
1116065	1118208	Yes, as MaceSatsuma in chat says, it's nose pond.
1120270	1121371	It's going up on the internet right now.
1121431	1122352	OrangeHandsRadio.com.
1122612	1123693	Click refresh a million times.
1124414	1124494	Okay.
1125675	1126536	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1148046	1150307	Only multiply if you have food because they eat your food.
1150347	1150807	I'm sorry.
1151188	1151908	Yes, that's right.
1152288	1153629	The picture should be up now.
1153789	1157491	If I see this on VeryDemotivational.com, I will kill you.
1159232	1161213	Don't tell them what website to post it to.
1162374	1163734	At least you're not John McCain.
1163754	1164535	Did you hear about that?
1164555	1165895	What the fuck happened this time?
1165975	1167276	I don't pay attention to that loser.
1167376	1168237	No, this is funny.
1168597	1173740	John McCain posted a picture of himself on the TwitPic or whatever, you know.
1174660	1176481	and I'm not starting a political thing.
1176541	1177521	I just think this is funny.
1177622	1179462	If it had been Obama, it would have been funny too.
1179482	1180863	Was he playing with his nipples or something?
1180903	1181243	No, no, no.
1182244	1183244	That would have been really funny.
1183645	1187426	No, he posted a picture just on his iPhone.
1187747	1189607	John McCain is really old, right?
1189707	1194690	So the joke is he's probably not hip with technology, but he's showing, hey, I can take a picture of myself with my iPhone.
1195370	1199892	So he did that and somebody took the picture and posted it to guyswithiphones.com.
1201233	1202514	John McCain on that website.
1226724	1236902	So you go to guyswithiphone.com And it's like penis, penis, balls, balls Wang, wang, butt, butt, John McCain It was funny
1238627	1239788	Alright, anyhow.
1241349	1242890	Hey, how about some housekeeping?
1243571	1245752	Maybe we will actually talk about some video games tonight.
1246152	1247894	It's going to be a short show tonight, kids.
1248314	1253117	Apologies, but if you can't tell why, I don't know what show you're listening to.
1253558	1258041	But it will be a bit of a short show tonight, meaning it's not part A, part B. It's just one giant part tonight.
1258141	1260402	So we're going to try and wrap up this show by 8 o'clock.
1260422	1261483	We will still take your calls.
1261823	1264185	We'll take your Twitter topics, mailbag, all that stuff.
1264225	1265106	We're not going to neglect it.
1265146	1267527	Just a few less stories tonight so we can get out of here.
1268348	1269451	I'm reading one email.
1270013	1271156	There's one email?
1271316	1272079	I'm going to read one.
1273399	1275120	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, what's next?
1275160	1276621	McCain gets on Chatroulette.
1276781	1277301	Oh, God.
1278041	1281343	Talk about the cesspool of the internet, Chatroulette.
1282023	1284684	I thought that was 2chan or 4chan.
1285445	1286885	There is no word to describe that.
1286945	1291407	But like Chatroulette, there's some really funny YouTubes that come of Chatroulette.
1291447	1297590	And my favorite is the guy that plays piano improv to the people on Chatroulette.
1297610	1298471	You've got to look this up.
1298511	1299171	What's his name?
1299291	1299791	Murhot?
1299871	1301452	Murhot is his name, something like that.
1301852	1302512	Thank you for watching!
1323427	1327029	Hey, gaming news, because we're a video game podcast.
1327069	1328389	Yuck, yuck, yuck.
1328690	1332672	Major Nelson starts off our game thing tonight.
1333252	1337574	And somebody hacked, hacksword Major Nelson's game card.
1338014	1338935	You know Major Nelson.
1338995	1339595	He's famous.
1339675	1343617	And, you know, if you're ever on the 360 and you download the Xbox, man, hi, I'm Major Nelson.
1344397	1345158	I'm at PAX East.
1346398	1347858	And that's exactly what he sounds like, too.
1348458	1352839	He always goes out to the different events, and he's the mouth for Xbox 360.
1352879	1354420	But that's a good thing.
1354680	1356320	Major Nelson is kind of the mouth for the 360.
1357360	1360661	Reggie Fils-Aimé is kind of the mouth, even though he's also the CEO.
1360681	1361901	He's kind of the mouth for Nintendo.
1361941	1366102	You kind of associate your Wii press conference with Reggie Fils-Aimé.
1366502	1368462	And then Sony... I don't know.
1368502	1370383	Sony doesn't really have a mouth.
1370663	1370903	I mean...
1372043	1378188	I guess there's that one girl who's on the core, but I can't even think of her name.
1378488	1380429	That tells you what a mouthpiece she is.
1380830	1383632	So Major Nelson is kind of like the spokesman, if you will, for 360.
1385393	1387435	But his gamer card was hacked.
1388175	1390517	And it happened around the time PAX was going on.
1390557	1392398	So they picked a good time to do it, honestly.
1392939	1398222	But what's weird is that, like, I don't understand why you would, like, hack somebody's thing.
1398343	1401645	Because they hacked his name to say, I'm a faggot.
1401825	1403807	Like, ha ha, funny.
1405348	1406589	Like, you're in the third grade.
1407229	1413694	And then, I don't know, they made the text say, any account, $100 PayPal.
1413714	1413774	Wow.
1416112	1430199	I guess meaning that you could pay these people $100 and they'll hack any account because, you know, if they can get Major Nelson, they can get your neighbor or your college friend that you're mad at or whatever as well.
1430940	1433401	Well, somebody took responsibility for it.
1433821	1437903	I'm not even going to say who it was because they're trash and I'm not going to promote them here on the show.
1437943	1440965	But somebody took responsibility for it and they even did a YouTube video about
1442403	1443183	Blah, blah, blah.
1443203	1446805	So obviously Microsoft fixed this, but this just begs the question, why?
1447285	1449286	Why would you hack someone's gamer card?
1449346	1450607	What is to gain from that?
1451087	1452828	It's EPing, Rob, really.
1452848	1458051	But, I mean, at least like when you hack a WoW account, like, you know, in my house... It's a famous target.
1459331	1464994	So it's kind of like when the celebrity Twitters get hacked, and like, you know, hi, I hacked Britney Spears, you know, I have a huge vagina.
1465454	1468396	It's funny to tweet as Britney Spears and say sick things.
1469396	1470477	I still don't understand.
1470517	1471017	Like, there's no...
1472406	1473687	I don't know, it just seems odd.
1474487	1475688	Like a gamer card?
1475948	1478069	Why don't you just hack majornelson.com?
1478289	1482752	Then you could get people to go to your trash website automatically.
1482792	1484493	Not that I'm saying you should do that, because you shouldn't.
1485013	1491077	But I don't understand the purpose of hacking someone's gamer card to say I'm a faggot nonetheless.
1493518	1494459	That's just stupid.
1494799	1496340	It is stupid, but you know what, Rob?
1496500	1500102	What you're doing right now, talking about it, that's exactly why they do it.
1500282	1529385	no I know which is why I didn't say the name of the site that took responsibility for it but I just think it's just weird to me like I think it does need to be talked about like why would people hack gamer cards or what's next this is so watch out don't make people too mad because they might send these guys $100 and your gamer card will be hacked next and everybody will think that you know you're a whatever 6th grade word they want to put in there to describe you so be careful
1529815	1531679	Maybe they need authenticators on Xbox Live.
1531699	1532722	Is that what's going to come next?
1532762	1533323	Authenticators?
1534325	1534666	Who knows?
1535107	1536751	You know, Kristen got hacked on WoW.
1540734	1541394	I had read about that.
1541414	1542855	A lot of people are getting hacked on WoW.
1543576	1545637	If you don't have an authenticator, you are going to get hacked.
1545737	1546778	It's just a matter of time.
1546898	1549060	I have an authenticator on my phone.
1549300	1551921	Do not think you are immune to this.
1552082	1557485	I got hacked on WoW and I am not stupid with stuff I downloaded.
1557525	1561848	I don't click banners on things that aren't legit and all this other stuff.
1561908	1564990	I got hacked and I think I know what happened.
1565010	1567672	I think I logged in on my ex's computer and he was stupid.
1568112	1570013	So, I think that's what happened.
1570033	1570614	You know what, Rob?
1570834	1571014	What?
1571074	1571914	I can't get hacked.
1572535	1572735	Why?
1572995	1574075	My account's disabled.
1574296	1575336	Well, yeah, you can't get hacked.
1575596	1576417	I'm paying for that!
1576457	1582320	Well, actually, actually, I've heard of them, like, re-enabling accounts and going back in.
1583140	1584041	So you gotta be careful.
1584141	1585082	Well, you are an authenticator.
1585142	1585562	You're fine.
1586723	1590686	But I think I had a friend who his account was dormant for like six months and they re-enabled it.
1591766	1600213	Oh man, they do this dirty, dirty stuff just to get in there and mine millions of ore and sell it to people.
1600553	1601053	Here's the thing.
1601114	1604836	When you buy gold online, you are supporting this.
1605117	1607058	I blame you as much as I blame the hackers.
1607138	1610200	When you buy gold online, you support all these accounts getting hacked.
1610300	1610821	Knock it off.
1611691	1617395	If I remember right, in Star Trek Online, we actually do have a report if ever we see anything happening right away.
1618616	1621097	It's set up in the mail and set up on the heads-up display.
1623279	1624379	Which I think is smart.
1625500	1627141	I don't remember Blizzard had anything like that.
1628222	1629383	I liked what Ion used to do.
1629423	1633245	They used to have these very public executions on the Ion server.
1633265	1635326	They would have public executions of spammers.
1635707	1636407	It was amazing.
1637188	1637948	That's what we need in WoW.
1639409	1640890	We need... This will be the nice thing.
1641170	1642551	OMG, spoiler alert coming.
1642571	1643512	Categories of spoiler.
1643552	1644593	Plug your ears if you don't want it.
1644613	1650577	Okay, when Grosh takes over the Horde, since he's like a nasty little man, he should just start executing the spammers.
1650677	1651378	That's what I want to see.
1651758	1653359	Apparently he's going to be executing everyone else.
1653659	1655101	So he needs to execute the spammers.
1655501	1656281	Okay, end spoiler.
1656421	1656922	Safe to listen.
1658260	1660721	Well, how about other stuff, Rob?
1660921	1661121	Okay.
1661621	1663982	Although I have to give a shout out to Get Games.
1664682	1669204	Their ads are really funny and stylistically very good.
1669664	1669904	Hmm.
1670324	1671405	As a designer, I like it.
1671825	1672125	Alrighty.
1672325	1674146	It says, in Soviet Russia, games get you.
1674246	1675046	Two sniffs up.
1676086	1679908	But it looks like old political posters.
1680468	1680608	Hmm.
1681815	1686277	Anyway, 2K Sports, they like a move in Natal.
1687337	1702143	Their marketing dude, Jason Argent, said that the sports games are a natural fit for motion control and was mentioning by name the 2K Major League Baseball series.
1702703	1708626	They didn't really give anything else up on that, but I think that they're pretty pleased with it and going to keep it going.
1709866	1711487	So, good for them.
1713615	1714456	I don't know, Rob, what do you think?
1715898	1731777	I think I should be able to get that big orange bat that you recently dug up, apparently according to your Facebook and with Natal, I should be able to use that bat as I play 2K games You'd have to come over here to get it Because I won't break anything at all doing that in my house The orange bat is awesome
1734011	1734891	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1757939	1759600	But this seems like a natural progression.
1759640	1771946	I mean, what smarter thing to do than to incorporate that with established franchises?
1772066	1772866	I need a lightsaber.
1774747	1778029	You know, this brings a whole new level to Rod Calibur, Rob.
1778309	1778489	Hmm.
1780808	1799467	I think though I hope that what these games do is make this support optional and I think they will I think they know that there's still a hardcore audience especially when you're talking about 2K and you know who knows whatever EA Sports ends up doing I think they still know there's a very hardcore audience that does not want to stand there and flail their arms everywhere to pretend you know what have you
1800942	1815605	I kind of like what they do you know it's weird we don't talk about sports games a lot on this show but I kind of like what they do with Madden is that on the Wii they really make the Wii game kind of targeted as the easy type game if you will and then the 360 and the PS3 versions are for the hardcore
1818143	1818683	Although I don't know.
1818703	1820084	I don't think they should do separate versions.
1820104	1821805	It should just be one version with two different modes.
1822766	1823587	But we'll see what they do.
1823687	1824407	You alright over there?
1826068	1827569	It's like death is on the show tonight.
1827589	1828230	This is amazing.
1828810	1830151	I don't even look like myself, Rob.
1832632	1835534	I can't believe you put that picture on the website.
1838519	1838959	Why not?
1838979	1840120	I don't care anymore.
1840140	1840721	No, it's fine.
1840901	1841221	It's fine.
1841241	1842803	Jamie's in don't give a shit mode.
1843043	1848908	Please go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com quickly before DarkSakura realizes what she did.
1849388	1850889	No, it's really a horrid picture.
1851950	1853632	I don't think I've ever looked that bad in my life.
1855513	1856354	You know what we need?
1857034	1859677	We need like a blingy competition with that picture.
1861697	1872487	A blingy, haven't you ever, well you don't use MySpace, so blingy is the site that puts the glitter and the hearts and all that just MySpace trash all over a picture.
1873027	1877692	So somebody needs to take your picture and blingy-fy it to make it pretty.
1878192	1880054	This is the most horrible picture of you ever.
1883357	1884618	What is wrong with this show tonight?
1885839	1887240	Loki, we need you.
1887400	1891362	I came home and I washed my face and I was like, fuck it, I don't care how it looks tonight.
1893744	1894444	Because it's just you.
1895004	1895545	It's just me.
1895605	1896505	It's just little old me.
1896525	1897086	It's Rob.
1897266	1897746	It's just me.
1898266	1898707	I don't care.
1899127	1900748	I love these Vicks inhaler things though.
1900768	1901428	They're perfect.
1902449	1903349	I might have to get one.
1903389	1903790	I don't know.
1903910	1904350	We'll see.
1904670	1905351	Although I feel okay.
1905371	1906171	I'm getting better.
1906511	1908773	It's just last week was bad.
1908813	1912975	I teach for a living and I couldn't talk Wednesday and Thursday and that's bad for a teacher.
1913635	1914536	That's really bad.
1916311	1919255	Toegak, by the way, is blingifying your picture right now.
1919515	1920016	I'm excited.
1920276	1921458	Please do not.
1922700	1923020	Really.
1924202	1926224	Or I'll never put another picture of me online again.
1927046	1929088	Toegak, send it to me private message, okay?
1929148	1930270	Don't post it publicly.
1931412	1931672	All right.
1933574	1936655	Anyhow, at least you're not a dirty thief.
1954420	1955060	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1985472	1986633	Because that makes it okay.
1987033	1990596	He stole about 14 megs of the code before somebody caught him.
1991917	1992937	That's so messed up.
1994439	1996880	By the way, the alleged thief, Justin D. May.
1997981	2000243	Wilmington, Delaware is where he lives, apparently.
2000303	2003045	And he's got a lovely little picture all over the internet now.
2003065	2005747	His little mugshot hit all the gaming blogs.
2007923	2012608	Let's see, he said, I got online using the Ethernet cable hanging outside their booth because Wi-Fi wasn't working.
2012648	2015570	They stopped me, checked my computer, and saw the Xbox Neighborhood application.
2015610	2019714	Because that was on there, they accused me of stealing Breach, even though it's not on my computer.
2020314	2021576	That's what he's saying in his defense.
2022737	2022957	Hmm.
2024867	2045374	apparently though the Atomic staff is counter responding to this saying he said several times he knew people and could give us bigger and more important people and he could name names however I have no idea if these people are on the show floor or just hackers at home I would hate to think he got someone's full code and their title is going to be compromised due to this guy I just need to make it clear he didn't say anything specific boy oh boy
2048931	2059133	Apparently this guy, oh my god, this guy apparently even spoke up at a panel earlier in the day about Xbox Live Enforcement and the thief wanted to get his gamer tag unbanned.
2060253	2065474	Stephen Tolous, I probably mispronounced that wrong, Tolous, I'm distracted by Jamie's nose blowing.
2066074	2077076	Stephen Tolous, the Director of Policy and Enforcement for Xbox Live actually asked the guy what he did and the hacker said he played Forza 3 before release and he said, well, you shouldn't have done that.
2078843	2085725	Now if you buy games early from a retailer that breaks street date, that doesn't get players banned, but illegal pre-release play does.
2087846	2088566	Good gosh.
2088786	2089327	What a mess.
2091747	2095889	S2100, Matt in our chatroom says, How stupid does this kid have to be to steal a game that had an ex-Marine at the booth?
2096389	2100590	Don't steal shit, especially when there are 60,000 witnesses around.
2100610	2105232	Don't steal shit to begin with, but really don't steal shit when there's that many people around.
2105932	2108233	Sometimes the best thefts happen in plain sight.
2109076	2109836	It's just dumb.
2110156	2110757	You're a dummy.
2113117	2114738	Well, how about something else that's dumb?
2114858	2117279	Although I kind of get it, but I still think it's a little on the stupid side.
2119299	2126201	The 3.21 firmware update for PS3 removes the option to install other OS.
2128542	2129782	So, no more Linux.
2131443	2134464	They're getting rid of that because of security concerns, they said.
2136269	2139251	So they're going to start taking features away from our PlayStation.
2139271	2140852	They're just like, nope, you know what?
2140872	2142113	You shouldn't have this feature anymore.
2142513	2142973	You know what?
2144354	2145655	Not smart of Sony to do.
2146355	2146896	You know why?
2146996	2152019	Because Sony is getting cocky with all this hacking scene thing.
2152059	2153560	And I just point to the PSP.
2154140	2158543	Every time Sony releases some patch, they say it's unhackable, unwinnable.
2158563	2159764	The hackers will never succeed.
2160004	2161345	They will never hack the PSP.
2161385	2162505	It is unhackable.
2162665	2163526	Two days later, it's hacked.
2164611	2166433	Well, this is what I say.
2166453	2168915	If people want something badly enough, they'll find a way to make it happen.
2169876	2175322	And so sure enough, they're going to shut off this because apparently there's some exploit now in the PS3 Linux.
2175382	2176483	I'm surprised it took that long.
2177344	2179847	But now they are taking away... One bad apple ruins the barrel.
2179867	2181148	They're taking it away from everybody.
2182546	2186448	and saying, well, this exploit is just undoable now.
2186488	2190090	We took away Linux, so now you can't do this at all.
2190270	2203296	Well, there is a hacker named George Hotz, who was an iPhone hacker, who apparently did crack the code on PS3, and then that's what might have started this whole thing.
2206084	2216534	but the point is is that if people want the hack bad enough there will be something that will reverse engineer the PS3 back to the old patch I mean they do it all the time with the PSP
2218208	2218528	I don't know.
2218869	2224414	I think though for the majority of people, for the common person, hardly anyone's going to notice this happen.
2224454	2228739	I mean, come on listeners, how many of you were really using this feature?
2229199	2231682	And maybe there's going to be a couple of you that are like, me, me, me, me.
2231962	2241051	Well, if that's you, then you're probably continuing to use your PS3 for its Linux features and therefore you're not going to want to take your PS3 on PlayStation Network and get the update.
2241852	2255759	because that's the only way you're going to be forced to update is when you try to play a game online or if you try to buy a new game, you know, that eventually, you know, the firmware will be on the disks for that later game, Uncharted 3 or whatever game comes later that everybody has to have.
2257545	2261386	Apparently, it's pretty big.
2261426	2264026	I might just put this in the chat room.
2264666	2269527	Because the way this guy has done it, I actually could see why Sony would make some changes.
2270008	2272448	Well, it's just a matter of time before he finds another.
2272468	2276409	He'll find an exploit in a game or something to reverse the firmware back to something old.
2276469	2277729	It's on the PSP all the time.
2278509	2280550	I'm sure if Loki were here, he'd say he'd already done it.
2281550	2282190	I'm like, it's just...
2285074	2291646	It's too bad that Sony felt the need to patch it out for everyone because this was found when this isn't going to stop it.
2291746	2292447	That's my point.
2292668	2294531	This is not going to stop the hacking process.
2296043	2298505	It's going to make it more difficult, yeah, but it's not going to stop it.
2298565	2300426	Those that really want to do it are still going to do it.
2301027	2303829	So it's just kind of a bummer to those that were using Linux legitimately.
2303869	2307951	But at the same time, I just can't think of a whole lots of reasons.
2307991	2316897	I mean, yeah, the computer in there was kind of unique, but I think if you harnessed its power for whatever, you're not really playing games with it, and therefore you won't be affected anyway.
2317218	2319779	There's just going to be such a minority of users affected by this.
2320740	2321780	But it still sucks for them.
2322941	2324841	You should send those angry cards and letters to Sony.
2325121	2328422	What I love about the patch that they did, didn't add a damn thing.
2328582	2329583	It didn't add anything.
2329603	2332003	There was no silver lining to this patch.
2332564	2334244	It's just, yep, we're just taking this feature away.
2334384	2334664	Later.
2337625	2341846	Toagak says, actually, they are having issues downgrading the PSP from recent firmware as well.
2341866	2342827	God, it's getting harder.
2343567	2344407	It's not going to stop them.
2346388	2347008	It won't stop them.
2349119	2354662	Anyhow, moving on to other news regarding the Xbox and talking about Game Room.
2355782	2357543	I've been playing Game Room a little bit here and there.
2357983	2359404	I like it overall.
2359544	2366367	I think they probably should have waited about three more months to release it for them to work out some of the bugs, but whatever.
2366487	2367888	It's okay.
2368168	2370069	It's showing promise.
2370269	2370809	Let's put it that way.
2370849	2371490	It's showing promise.
2372250	2374091	Game Room Game Room
2397088	2400829	So if you were hoping for more games, nope, not going to happen right away.
2401350	2408072	I'm looking forward to Pitfall and Kaboom and some of the other Activision classics and who knows what other little arcade gems they might dig up.
2408112	2408893	Burger time, anyone?
2410193	2411774	But we're not going to start seeing those until late April.
2414596	2417919	Interesting tidbit, by the way, because I don't think this came up on our show.
2417939	2423123	I think I mentioned it on Bobby's show on the call, but I actually was with a pal, Seg.
2423183	2427487	My friend Seg was playing Game Room on the show floor at Microsoft's booth.
2428087	2431310	And what's really funny is that he actually got the blue screen to death on the game.
2431871	2439517	And honestly, it seemed like all he did was set the controller down on top of the computer and it just threw the whole damn thing off balance and it blue screened to death right in front of everybody.
2440918	2447642	So we were playing Game Room on the show floor, and before he managed to crash the thing, I asked the guy, I said, so they're going to be doing weekly releases with this?
2447702	2449543	I heard something like a thousand games.
2449563	2450984	Keep in mind, I don't have a media badge on.
2451024	2453646	I didn't go to Pax's Media, so I'm just the everyday gamer.
2454686	2465873	And the guy said to me, he said, well, I don't know if weekly releases is what they're going to end up doing, but they want to look at doing regular releases.
2465933	2467194	But I don't know if it'll be weekly.
2467782	2469625	So they're already starting to backtrack a little bit.
2469645	2470987	Releases that eat their fiber?
2472750	2473711	It will not be regular.
2473791	2473972	No.
2474973	2477978	It will be just sporadic and all over the place.
2479059	2480962	Like a McDonald's inspired release.
2483786	2485566	Well, how about other stuff?
2485726	2485906	Yes.
2486247	2487247	How about Miyamoto?
2487267	2488387	I think being a little foolish.
2489847	2504231	He basically thinks that Nintendo has a responsibility to educate the larger audiences about the benefits of gaming that he thinks that most people are afraid of gaming technology.
2505431	2505671	That
2507170	2509611	You know, once they become accustomed to it, there's nothing to be afraid at all.
2510671	2511912	How about just people don't like games?
2512512	2513732	Some of them just don't like video games.
2516593	2517854	I think there's a little truth to that.
2517934	2520334	I mean, like, my parents don't like video games.
2521155	2521715	Well, I don't know.
2522815	2524816	My dad doesn't care, but he doesn't really play them.
2525736	2527997	I think there are a lot of people that don't get games.
2528577	2531118	I mean, going back to PAX a little bit,
2532386	2539369	Part of the whole, you know, people were very moved by Wil Wheaton's opening speech and all this stuff, which I get because it was very rah, rah, rah.
2539809	2540850	This is our culture.
2540950	2541770	This is our time.
2541790	2542571	This is your place.
2542951	2544332	Nobody's going to judge you here.
2544452	2546333	You can be a gamer here and nobody's going to care.
2546673	2552956	Okay, well, that says to me that even we as gamers recognize that not everybody gets gaming.
2553896	2554356	You know what I mean?
2554656	2555697	And don't get me wrong.
2555737	2556537	I think it's ridiculous.
2556757	2559399	I mean, games are no different than movies in my opinion.
2560519	2563222	I mean, you know... It's interactive entertainment.
2563703	2565064	It's interactive entertainment.
2565865	2567807	You know, Nookie is interactive entertainment.
2568668	2570450	So, it just depends on what you like.
2570550	2575775	I mean, I don't get people that hate on games, but I think we recognize there are people that just don't get it for whatever reason.
2576836	2578338	There's a lot of stuff I don't get.
2578518	2579279	Like The Hills.
2580500	2582482	I heard The Hills got cancelled finally.
2583519	2585604	It took like five years for this to happen.
2585744	2586826	I don't get the hills.
2587067	2589091	Like, Heidi and Spencer, why are they famous?
2589191	2589391	Why?
2589472	2590233	I don't get that.
2591596	2594362	And some people don't get why Final Fantasy XIII is awesome.
2597406	2619263	so there are people out there that just aren't going to get games I mean wasn't that Nintendo's whole little thing was that they were going to try and make games more accessible to everybody and they somewhat I don't know I think they somewhat succeeded I mean they've sold tons of consoles and people are all about you know Wii Fit and Wii Sports and all these games that have seemed to cross over into the mainstream you know
2620146	2622508	Now, there is a quote from him I want to read.
2623088	2624510	It has to do with Sony and Microsoft.
2625510	2633877	We feel it's an honor that some form of entertainment style we created is now going to be taken for granted thanks to the attitude taken by other companies.
2635659	2637740	Meaning their adoption of motion control.
2638581	2642024	Aha, so it's the kind of thing where it's like, well, everybody else seems to agree.
2642384	2644646	Imitation is the best form of...
2646383	2654685	Plus, you're forgetting, Microsoft does an incredibly good job of stealing people's ideas and making them better.
2655245	2657706	And I think that's what they're trying to do with this whole Natal thing.
2657726	2659266	They're going to make it better.
2660166	2660606	But we'll see.
2660646	2661566	I mean, that's still debatable.
2661606	2667708	You can't really argue that until the system or game or whatever you want to call it itself comes out.
2667768	2668288	But we'll see.
2668948	2673716	PlayStation Move, you know, some of the early feedback was pretty good that it's way more responsive than the Wii.
2674477	2675999	That's just competition, my friends.
2676060	2676661	Competition.
2677762	2679325	All these companies trying to one-up each other.
2681112	2688137	Speaking of which, there are a lot of companies out there that are currently trying to get your dollar as far as selling their video games.
2688477	2691019	And we'll start with Japan this week for the release dates.
2691919	2692740	Some of the release dates.
2693240	2697143	Not a lot of new games on the 360 in Japan this week, but a crap ton of price reductions.
2697203	2704328	Death Smiles, Far Cry 2, Mass Effect, Ninja Blade, Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, Hawk, all getting price reductions this week.
2706869	2708650	Moving on to the PlayStation 3.
2709931	2711271	Also, just price reductions.
2711331	2711951	No new games.
2712191	2716113	X-Blades and Tom Clancy's HAWK or Hux.
2716193	2717914	Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.
2718054	2719434	It's really kind of a dry week.
2719835	2722856	PlayStation 2, Clover, no Kuni, no Alice.
2722916	2725077	It's like the only new game I'm seeing there on the PlayStation 2.
2725937	2727118	on the Nintendo DS.
2728719	2731341	Again, nothing really new this week.
2731421	2732241	It's a slow week.
2732281	2732562	I don't know.
2732582	2736224	You'd think like there's a Dragon Warrior game or something coming out or everything's getting out of the way.
2736824	2739906	On the PSP, Monochrome is coming out this week.
2739947	2741347	I believe that's the sequel to Echochrome.
2742288	2755517	And then there is one other game coming out, Jude no Atelier, Grimmonaut no Rekinjutsu, Toraware no Morito from Gust, which is, well, it looks like there's this like, let's see.
2758520	2774774	it's like a time traveling game and cute little slime looking characters and little teddy bears and cute stuff and chicks with enormous breasts so you're very like anime infused game it's a PSP remake apparently of an older game so there you go
2775802	2787380	I've got a couple of UK releases if you're ready Yippee Just two Blue Toad Murder Files Episodes 4, 5, and 6 And Lead and Gold Gangs of the Wild West That's it
2790086	2790586	Thanks for watching!
2809774	2811776	a game called Again on the DS.
2811996	2813838	It's an action game from Koei Entertainment.
2814198	2819002	And then my personal favorite here of the week that's coming out, Squishy Tank on the Nintendo DS.
2819702	2820823	And I love the cover.
2820863	2822044	Of course it's from Natsume.
2822565	2823625	I love the cover art.
2823665	2824566	It's like a puzzle game.
2825167	2835115	And if you look at the cover art, it looks like imagine a slime from the Dragon Quest series and somebody is poking it and so it has the angry face because it's being poked, yet it is a tank.
2836676	2837917	So there it is.
2839821	2841082	Squishy Tank for $20.
2842142	2842723	Squithy.
2843403	2844624	It's a puzzle game.
2844644	2848486	It looks like match-up colored blocks and make tanks squishy.
2848883	2849583	and Squizzy.
2849883	2850463	Squizzy.
2852124	2854064	Oh, we're ready to get into, I guess, the mailbag.
2854084	2857705	We're at that part of the show where we're going to dive into the mailbag and read some of your emails here.
2858025	2858786	I'm reading three.
2859046	2861566	And DarkSakura will try her best to not sniff through them all.
2861586	2862887	Thank you everyone for keeping them short.
2864987	2866888	By the way, if you want to send us emails, please do.
2866968	2868068	Next week, hopefully, we'll be better.
2868688	2875310	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place you send emails and DarkSakura reads them like she's going to do right now while I munch on this tortilla.
2876420	2877240	Hey, OLR.
2877481	2878581	Oh, you haven't eaten it yet?
2879562	2880502	I've been talking.
2880542	2881543	I can't eat and talk.
2881563	2882643	We'll fucking eat already.
2882743	2883464	Alright, you talk.
2883504	2883844	I'll eat.
2884264	2885485	Let me know how it is.
2885925	2886685	Hey, OLR.
2886705	2891588	I was listening to your podcast at work and noticed Rob wonder why Final Fight and Magic Sword are getting packaged together.
2892048	2892528	The reason?
2892608	2897251	Simply that the developers of the company who are doing the port love Magic Sword.
2897911	2901533	The only way they would have been able to get it released is to bundle it with another game.
2902373	2908321	So can you... So you can think they're completely selfish acts as the reason you're getting Magic Sword.
2908602	2910464	P. A-Z-H-P.
2911025	2911386	P.S.
2911446	2912968	When Rob asks Loki to be a lady...
2914932	2920115	For some reason I had an image of Rob singing Loki Be A Lady to the tune of Luck Be A Lady by Frank Sinatra.
2920295	2920796	I did that.
2921696	2922797	Loki Be A Lady tonight.
2922837	2925318	Loki, if you've been a lady to begin with, Loki Be A Lady tonight.
2925358	2926499	I really did that on the show.
2926539	2927540	I told Loki to be a lady.
2930021	2930922	Apparently I was drunk.
2932063	2933083	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
2933123	2933904	Thanks for the email.
2934784	2937926	There should be more random tangents and acts of love.
2938106	2939847	I know there's Guardian Legend fans out there.
2940208	2940648	Help me out.
2943080	2943561	But thank you.
2943701	2945622	I'm so excited about Magic Sword I could piddle.
2947003	2947244	Okay.
2948805	2949265	Next one.
2951427	2953509	Good evening, Originals Radio and fellow listeners.
2953529	2954009	This is Jeet.
2954049	2954810	It's writing in again.
2955730	2966218	Seeing as it's my birthday today, then that I am in the process of getting ready for a night out, I realize I won't be able to attend the live show today, which I regret as it is always something fun and enlightening.
2967672	2973297	I remember myself when I was under the age of 18 and had no problem purchasing one of the worst slash best murder simulators of all time, Grand Theft Auto 3.
2991198	2997404	I am not really shocked that I managed to pull it off, but I am a bit dismayed that the retailers don't seem to care.
2997504	3004791	So the question is, Do you think it's too easy for children to acquire mature rated games, or are the measures taken by retailers good enough?
3005592	3010877	Sorry for any and all spelling errors and or grammatical mistakes, and have a happy Easter, everyone.
3011037	3012058	G. Ditz, The Other Swede
3013957	3015118	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3033229	3035512	If the kid gets the game that's on the parent, not on the store.
3036953	3038635	I pretty much agree with DarkSakura.
3038675	3039776	Totally.
3040137	3041618	Stores do the best they can.
3041658	3047845	I think if stores are shown to not be following the rules, then action should be taken accordingly.
3048106	3050648	They do the same thing with cigarettes and alcohol and all this stuff.
3050989	3052510	But ultimately, it's up to the parents.
3053291	3063458	I mean, you don't know if somebody might have an older brother who will go in and buy the game for them or a friend who's older, a cousin, I don't know, that's kind of like the hookup.
3063478	3065579	There's nothing the stores can do about that.
3066240	3070643	And if a kid wants an M-rated game bad enough and finds that hookup, then they're going to do it.
3070823	3075346	Unless the parents say, if I catch you playing that game, I'm going to fucking throw your Xbox in the trash.
3076266	3077928	And that's something my parents would have said.
3079148	3080910	That's what it ultimately comes down to.
3080930	3082671	I think my mom would have said, when did you get this?
3083171	3083591	Rob, that is gross.
3083631	3086253	What is that game that you're playing?
3086273	3087434	That is gross.
3087474	3088675	Rob, did he just knock the head off?
3088715	3089215	Rob, what are you playing?
3113471	3117596	Mortal Kombat Fatalities are funny.
3131118	3131638	Last one.
3133619	3139702	He put a lot of information on here, but I'm not going to say it until I have his express permission to.
3141362	3142043	Hey, OLR.
3142563	3146765	Just wanted to give you a quick update on the whole fiasco going on with GameCrazy.
3146825	3148705	This is the guy who's the manager in Colorado.
3148805	3149145	Ah, yes.
3150726	3157768	My store, along with four others in the Denver slash Pueblo area, the only two stores in Colorado remain, is now starting liquidation this Friday.
3158528	3163589	Jamie, I really hope that Dan is still safe, and if not, I guess we are all in this together.
3164029	3168170	Wish me luck with everything that will be coming my and or our way.
3169651	3176393	And to think I almost bought a 3D HDTV at Best Buy yesterday, but my little guardian angel was telling me not to, and now I know why.
3176993	3177553	Frowny face.
3178693	3180916	Please let me know what is going on in your neck of the woods.
3181516	3185340	One good thing to pass on, a lot of my customers are now listening to your show and love it, so keep it up.
3185500	3186842	Take care, dude.
3187042	3189845	Well, then I apologize to your customer base for tonight's show.
3190506	3192948	But I'm sorry to hear it, dude.
3192968	3193629	That's not cool.
3193949	3196972	I hope it works out for the best.
3197113	3198954	I mean, I hope you're able to find something somewhere else.
3198995	3200616	I mean, those customers are going to have to go somewhere, so...
3201837	3204880	This is also dated from March 22nd, so he might have heard already.
3205761	3206742	Dan dodged the bullet.
3207182	3207542	Wow.
3208203	3208583	Good for him.
3208703	3212647	They closed down a bunch of other stores, but Dan's store was still a pretty well-performing store.
3213367	3215769	So he's like, we didn't get any inventory.
3215829	3218952	We were running out and we were sad and we thought we were going to go.
3219473	3220834	And then we got a shipment.
3222055	3223676	And then they said, yeah.
3223736	3225558	So Dan's store is still around for a little bit.
3225978	3226879	Dan is also awesome.
3228220	3233106	There's a thought that his might be one of the ones to survive Chapter 11 if the company survives.
3234187	3238472	He just said he was a little disappointed because he hates driving to Cameron Park.
3239333	3239854	That's far.
3240795	3241596	I've never been there.
3242337	3244900	It snows and shit there, doesn't it?
3245420	3245881	It's kind of far.
3246281	3257342	so um manager dude which I'm calling you until you say I can actually say it's you I mean it put a store number and everything but I don't want to jump the gun yeah yeah um
3260884	3262346	I say write it out through liquidation.
3262426	3264427	Take your unemployment.
3265208	3268531	And I hope that you... Oh my god, this show is so broken.
3268631	3269051	Sorry.
3269852	3272334	And I hope that something works out well for you.
3272854	3275837	And thank you for, by the way, spreading us around like a disease.
3276738	3277618	I appreciate it.
3277918	3278899	Robin, you know what?
3278979	3280200	Did I ever tell you about the Dorbola?
3280701	3281041	Uh-uh.
3281882	3284944	It was the... Not Anime Expo.
3285004	3285245	It was...
3289661	3291362	Faname 2000, I think.
3291542	3292203	My first Faname.
3292643	3293804	When I did my Emmy cosplay.
3294685	3306813	Apparently, all the Bay Area DDR players and everything were getting sick from an illness that was, in theory, started by a certain moderator at the time on DDR Freak.
3307733	3309435	And I thought, oh, I'm not going to get it.
3309475	3310035	It's all over.
3310075	3310916	The epidemic's gone.
3311036	3313377	I came back home sick with Dorbola.
3314018	3314338	Yikes.
3315018	3315479	Sorry to hear it.
3315879	3317280	Con, con crap.
3318361	3318742	But no.
3320083	3325748	And I did get your email on my personal email address and I've just been swamped, so.
3326008	3335716	By the way, I have heard that there are game stores out there and like little computer places, well, not little, but you know, like LAN centers and stuff that actually play this show at the center.
3336136	3337157	And I think that's rad.
3337257	3338438	Like, thank you guys so much.
3338458	3342442	Like, we really ought to tone down the swearing so that it would be okay for more places to play us.
3342802	3343562	I said crap.
3343582	3344863	I didn't say shit.
3345603	3345863	Oops.
3346444	3354747	I bet we're a heck of a lot more interesting than those stupid tapes they probably send them to play with all the like, you know, Hi, I'm Jeff Keighley and let's see what game's coming out next.
3355768	3359750	You know, like that stuff probably gets really old to see on loop over and over again.
3359770	3362711	I think, you know, podcasts are kind of fun.
3363751	3365712	We'll have to think about cleaning it up someday.
3365752	3366992	We're verbal kitsch, Rob.
3367172	3368233	We're verbal kitsch.
3369513	3374155	But back to the subject at hand, dude, I feel really rotten for you.
3376155	3380717	Shoot me another email to my real email and I will respond to you.
3381677	3386359	I'm just so sorry that this crap is happening.
3386819	3390440	A lot of it is their own fault for their marketing strategy.
3391676	3394047	I think that GameStop really started dominating the market.
3394966	3397646	You might just want to send with your email, though, some E. Perel.
3398447	3401307	As SalaciousPop in chat says, this episode needs to come with some Perel.
3402907	3407448	Jamie's about to go flush her head in the toilet to get it to stop hurting.
3407548	3412089	By the way, backing up to some earlier messages in chat room from when I was impersonating my mother.
3412629	3415110	Mamesatsuma says, Sky's parents were from Sesame Street.
3415410	3415890	Yeah, apparently.
3416650	3420031	Tigerclaw said, Rob was probably like, hey mom, watch this.
3420091	3422331	He does a fatality in the game and she just goes ballistic.
3422591	3423211	Thank you for watching!
3441258	3447043	Julian went up to Becky and picked his nose and said, Yummy!
3447503	3449365	With a big grin on his face.
3450206	3451947	Just to, I guess, see reaction.
3452628	3454509	This two-year-old has mastered smart, Rob.
3456411	3457272	He's a smart kid.
3461235	3462836	And then he shook his head and goes, Yucky.
3462956	3463377	Yucky.
3466103	3492527	SSJ100 Matt says no don't tone down the language everybody's getting freaked out that we're suddenly going to go G-rated no we're not going to tone down the language it would be nice if I had the time or one of us had the time or somebody had the time that we could go through the episode and beep out obscenities and that way you could have like a G-rated version you know safe for broadcast but let's face it we're all too lazy it's not going to happen I mean Loki's on this program I mean there's just it's not going to happen not going to happen
3493328	3496590	Hey, by the way, if you want to send in some emails, you should do so.
3496670	3499151	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send them.
3500451	3505133	Now's the part of the show where we show a little angst and anger and say, F you, man.
3505554	3505854	F you.
3522665	3524146	I guess I'll start the FUs tonight.
3524367	3524867	Oh, no, you're back?
3524887	3525408	Oh, hi.
3525568	3526649	DarkSakura starts off tonight.
3527109	3527469	Fuck you.
3529792	3530352	Shit.
3530372	3531873	Something fell.
3533295	3537679	A few of my allergies and the Sacramento area for being rife with plant life.
3538540	3539500	I hope it all burns.
3540001	3541202	Except for me and my stuff.
3542343	3542723	And yours.
3543464	3544265	I need to see your new house.
3545620	3546161	It's quaint.
3548082	3548703	Come over next week.
3548723	3550284	Oh, no, you have other stuff next weekend.
3550564	3551445	Come over soon.
3552045	3553647	Let's have breakfast on Sunday.
3554187	3554667	All right, we'll see.
3557310	3558911	F you to Pax East Plague.
3559331	3560492	Am I the only one that has it?
3560912	3561473	I think I am.
3562334	3563575	F you, Pax East Plague.
3563915	3571301	But I would like to say non-F you to these lovely triple chocolate M&Ms that DarkSakura just gave me.
3571321	3572502	They are purple and sparkly.
3572802	3573603	I'm going to take pictures of them.
3573623	3575724	It's the gayest food I think I've ever seen.
3575904	3577325	Dude, that's what I said in the kitchen.
3577866	3580007	Rob, I'm going to bring you some of the gayest food I've ever eaten.
3580027	3583410	This is very gay.
3585732	3587373	SSJ100Matt in the chat.
3587413	3588293	This is a good question.
3589694	3593137	And sure, we'll let chatters derail the flow of the show tonight because I don't care tonight.
3593197	3594898	I mean, this show is already fucked up as it is.
3595539	3597700	SSJ100Matt says, serious question for you.
3598241	3601043	What did your parents think of you guys playing DDR?
3602574	3604796	Dance Dance Revolution, the game that brought this show together.
3605176	3606717	DarkSakura, what did your parents think?
3606777	3609919	I mean, well, you were really living with your parents at that time.
3609939	3611240	I was trying to explain it to my mom.
3611260	3611841	She was like, what?
3614283	3615864	That was pretty much it with my parents, too.
3615904	3618345	I mean, obviously, I'd moved out of the house by then.
3618365	3619226	I was living on my own.
3620707	3622989	I would have been like, God, what year did we all start playing DDR?
3623009	3624470	It was 2000 for me.
3624790	3625491	So I'd have been 21.
3625531	3626852	You were just a young'un.
3626872	3627412	10 years ago, I'd have been 21.
3627452	3627492	So...
3630274	3653350	I was already out of the house by then so my parents didn't really know but they found out later on because when we started doing the tournaments and stuff like remember we ended up on the news sometimes and then like you know our show ended up on the news and some of that stuff and so my parents were kind of like okay well like I think they just don't get it I think my mom just kind of giggles like I think she kind of points and laughs at me but doesn't like outright do that because I'm her kid
3654723	3661727	You know what?
3662167	3664168	I'm just in that kind of mood tonight where I don't really care.
3666029	3666549	Do it.
3668530	3669510	Let's give somebody a call.
3669951	3670531	Let's find out.
3671191	3672432	Because I need to know.
3673392	3673692	Hold on.
3675613	3677154	I just have to know the answer to this question.
3677174	3678375	This is a very good question that S.J.
3678415	3679135	and her mat's posing.
3686357	3687258	Hi mom, it's Rob.
3690580	3691361	She hung up on me.
3691421	3692481	My mother just hung up on me.
3695823	3697204	Maybe she doesn't want to be on the radio.
3697244	3697804	Let's try this again.
3698105	3699305	Live radio, boys and girls.
3706070	3706570	Is it working?
3707330	3708051	Stupid Skype.
3709572	3710472	Let's try this one more time.
3710933	3711553	Then I'm going to give up.
3715540	3724585	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific.
3724645	3727867	Thank you, All Games Radio, for letting us steal your bandwidth.
3727907	3729868	Hey, Scott has a new show starting, Appaday TV.
3730088	3730588	Check that out.
3730948	3731689	We can call mine.
3731969	3732309	Hello?
3732649	3733510	Hi, it's Rob.
3733530	3733950	Are you there?
3735131	3735631	I'm here.
3735871	3736852	You keep hanging up on me.
3736952	3738112	No, I didn't hang up on you.
3738172	3739493	It's the internet.
3739533	3740433	We're on the radio.
3740514	3741054	Is that okay?
3743262	3746576	all right say hi what say hi to the listeners mommy
3748191	3748771	Hi, Mommy.
3750573	3751713	Hi, this is Jamie.
3751834	3753335	I haven't seen you in a while, but hi.
3753355	3753395	Hi.
3753635	3755636	Now everybody at work is sick.
3773527	3773727	Uh-huh
3802081	3802781	What did you think of it?
3802801	3803141	Yeah, I knew.
3803522	3804302	What did you think of it?
3806282	3807703	I thought it was good exercise.
3808343	3809463	It was good exercise.
3809503	3813224	I was probably never at my thinnest, or I was never thinner than I was when I played that, huh?
3813264	3814565	Except when you had pancreatitis.
3814665	3816245	That's absolutely true.
3817585	3821066	Am I supposed to not like it or something?
3821206	3822687	No, no.
3823427	3824287	Let me ask you this.
3824447	3827848	Were there ever video games that I played growing up that you didn't like?
3829769	3830669	That I didn't like?
3830749	3830949	Yeah.
3833630	3837431	I wasn't particularly fond of the very violent games.
3837451	3842673	Well, I just don't think it's particularly good for children to be playing those kind of games.
3854281	3855783	War games and things like that.
3856865	3860309	Did you ever catch me playing a bad video game and you grounded me?
3860329	3861331	Because I don't really remember.
3861351	3861831	No.
3861971	3864455	I just remember you... No, because you had pretty good taste.
3864615	3866437	You didn't really like those violent games.
3866457	3867559	Well, now that's not true.
3867639	3869702	See, I was really good at hiding it from you.
3870803	3871723	Well, maybe so.
3871823	3875985	Maybe I just... Never tell your mother how sneaky and devious you were as a child.
3876105	3878646	Oh, she knows all about that stuff now because it's funny.
3878706	3882247	My sister and I will get together and exchange stories with my mother sitting right there.
3884948	3889630	Okay, but the other thing... Do you remember a game called Mortal Kombat that I used to play?
3891471	3892531	Yeah, I didn't like that one.
3892691	3893852	Yeah, wasn't it gross?
3895069	3895910	It was pretty gross.
3896230	3902614	Because I was doing an impersonation earlier that you would come in the room and you would say, Rob, what is that game?
3902634	3903955	That is a gross game.
3904015	3904636	Turn off that game.
3904676	3906017	It's gross.
3906357	3907718	You were a little older then, too.
3907738	3908378	You weren't real.
3908559	3911000	I mean, you were like 14, maybe.
3912161	3912842	So it was okay.
3912902	3914242	I was at the point where it was okay.
3914283	3915483	Well, you weren't real.
3915623	3916964	I'm thinking 5, 6, 7, 8.
3917925	3922048	I wouldn't think that would be appropriate for a child that age.
3922402	3924964	It's a matter of taste, I guess.
3925024	3928047	And for one thing, I'm not that well coordinated.
3928327	3930549	I'd probably fail at it, you know, because
3949306	3954010	I think you've been doing it ever since you were a little kid, so you're pretty well-coordinated.
3954430	3958293	As far as using the joystick and stuff, I'm not.
3959034	3963457	So I'd rather be entertained rather than trying to entertain myself like that.
3964017	3964278	All right.
3964518	3965899	You're not interested in getting a Wii?
3966099	3967140	You don't want to do Wii bowling?
3971303	3973324	No, not really.
3973545	3973865	Okay.
3974452	3974772	All right.
3975493	3975813	All right.
3975833	3977314	Are you going to give me a Wii?
3977354	3978834	You're going to give me a Wii?
3978854	3979495	Do you want a Wii?
3979535	3980915	Is that what you want for Christmas?
3982036	3986758	No, but you acted like you were trying to get me to say, oh, yeah, I'd love to have a Wii so you could get me one.
3987038	3987719	You wouldn't use it.
3987819	3988919	That's why I'm not going to get you one.
3988939	3989540	You wouldn't use it.
3989920	3990480	You're right.
3990640	3993642	The first time I'd wear myself out and then I'd say never again.
3994682	3994922	All right.
3995683	4000185	Anything you want to say to the listeners of our fine radio program, the five people?
4000325	4002646	I want to ask them why they don't have something better to do.
4009258	4009839	10-15 on the East Coast
4031147	4032268	My mom doesn't live on the East Coast.
4032308	4033268	She lives in Central Time.
4033288	4033829	Oh, Central Time.
4033849	4034429	So 9-15.
4034449	4034849	I don't care.
4034909	4035269	Wake her up.
4035569	4036610	Alright, here you go.
4036630	4037571	Punch in the number one.
4037771	4041453	Mobile.
4042093	4042313	Okay.
4044274	4044754	Let's see.
4049617	4051998	It's Easter with the family here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4052799	4054280	Oh, it did not like that number.
4054360	4055060	What did I do wrong?
4055180	4057401	Mom's phone number acts wonky sometimes.
4058042	4059242	Can you show it to me one more time here?
4059542	4060163	Yeah, give me a sec.
4060263	4060383	Okay.
4062583	4063024	The top one.
4066974	4067596	Okay, here we go.
4068759	4069099	Here it goes.
4069180	4069581	It's calling.
4069901	4070683	DarkSakura, it's all you.
4092435	4093015	Come on, Mom.
4094837	4095477	She went to bed.
4095517	4096078	You're in trouble.
4096138	4096378	No.
4097599	4098700	She's not sleeping.
4100241	4101202	She's out partying.
4101642	4102643	Let's leave her a voicemail.
4102823	4103043	Okay.
4105425	4106466	Hi, this is Kathy.
4106646	4108387	I'm sorry I can't take your call right now.
4108727	4109608	Please leave me a message.
4109628	4110749	She's so adorable.
4114252	4116413	At the tone, please record your message.
4116974	4121057	When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options.
4122472	4124753	Hi Mommy, it's your spawn.
4126053	4126873	The female one.
4128713	4130834	Your voicemail is live on Orange Nolts Radio.
4130874	4132554	We were trying to call you because it was funny.
4133935	4136715	But you would have been an internet celebrity.
4136835	4137695	But you missed your chance.
4137735	4138175	Sorry Mom.
4138336	4139696	We were going to ask you about video games.
4139776	4140216	That's Rob.
4140236	4142696	The terrible influence they had on your child.
4143237	4144777	So call back this number.
4145598	4146339	I don't think it'll work.
4146499	4147600	It shows up as like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
4148180	4148660	We'll poo.
4148921	4150542	Text Jamie and we'll call you back.
4150702	4151303	Love you, Mom.
4151663	4151903	Bye.
4151923	4152423	Love you, Mom.
4152564	4153484	Bye, Mom's voicemail.
4154965	4155346	All right.
4157087	4159469	Well, now we've successfully derailed the show three times over.
4159489	4160270	That was a lot of fun.
4160510	4163612	Hey, and we had a canine visitor.
4163712	4167535	I know, and I'm not a big fan of big dogs, so that kind of scared the hell out of me, but thank you.
4167695	4168036	All right.
4169757	4170778	All of a sudden, I just turn around.
4170798	4171478	There's a dog in my life.
4172881	4175603	Drew, did you know I was bit by a dog when I was five years old?
4176123	4177864	I've had issues with them ever since.
4178384	4180005	That's what you said.
4180425	4180665	I know.
4181026	4182106	Just in case the listeners don't know.
4182546	4184187	I'm not a fan of big dogs.
4186048	4187789	Hey, how about video games?
4187809	4192792	I think I put up the picture of the very gay M&M's.
4198237	4200478	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars
4226875	4241143	So meaning that when you take the other M-rated titles, Dementium, The Ward, Resident Evil Deadly Silence, Touch the Dead, Core, Ultimate Mortal Kombat, and all these games, and you add them all up, it doesn't match what Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars has sold.
4241503	4248267	And this is kind of interesting because Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, the sales overall, have tended to be considered a disappointment.
4249676	4253118	And they even came out and said, you know, they were blaming it on piracy.
4253158	4259582	That the commercial performance of Chinatown Wars has certainly suffered at the hands of piracy was an earlier quote about that.
4260203	4263805	I think it's interesting because it just goes to show M-rated games are not selling on the DS.
4263845	4265846	But at the same time, I kind of think, well, duh.
4266587	4268388	Most DS owners are kids.
4269129	4269609	Like, really.
4270149	4271170	Like, true story.
4271650	4273391	I was at Outback last night.
4273591	4274552	The table next to us.
4274692	4276573	What does the little kid have that's waiting for his little...
4277754	4283197	Little Joey, you know what they call the young kangaroo menu, the Joey menu, waiting for his little kid steak.
4283457	4284337	He was playing a DS.
4285017	4286258	Probably Pokemon or something.
4287539	4288659	The Pokemanses.
4289520	4293641	I mean, the DS is like most popular with kids, like tweens, if you will.
4294722	4298924	So, of course, the M-rated games are not going to sell that well because my mother would not have bought me that game when I was growing up.
4299664	4301025	So, there you go.
4303689	4304010	I don't know.
4304050	4308772	So maybe they just need to make some better games, but honestly, I just don't think the DS is the platform for an M-rated game.
4308953	4309733	It's mostly kids.
4310934	4311334	There you go.
4311854	4312815	DarkSakura, what's up next?
4313610	4314250	Some stuff.
4316271	4318072	Final Fantasy IX, actually.
4319012	4333558	They are planning on putting Final Fantasy IX on PSN, and it was confirmed by Yoichi Iwata that it would join Final Fantasy VII and VIII on the PS3.
4334658	4336599	So, yay, all the VV you want.
4336779	4337440	Well, why not?
4337500	4338380	It's free money.
4339426	4344770	Honestly, for putting a nostalgic game that everybody knows and loves back on the PlayStation Network.
4344810	4347152	Although it was probably a Final Fantasy a lot of people skipped over.
4347432	4349153	I don't think IX sold quite as well as the other ones.
4349173	4350054	I didn't play that much of it.
4350795	4354377	Actually, I played more of IX than I did of VIII because I actually liked IX.
4354958	4356959	I actually got past the first disc on IX.
4357680	4359401	I didn't beat it, but I went pretty far in it.
4359741	4360222	It was a good game.
4362375	4367879	It was, you know, that more traditional Final Fantasy as opposed to that cyberpunk kind of looking thing, and that was its big thing.
4368660	4372103	How about some Twitter topics?
4372143	4380329	I don't even know if we got Twitter topics tonight, but we're going to go ahead and take some Twitter topics now on our Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
4380349	4385634	Although I'm trying to load the Twitter right now.
4386995	4389837	Hopefully I'll be able to filter out all the tweets about Justin Bieber.
4391670	4397075	Saga confirms closure of internal Iron Man and Golden Axe developer Do you know where that Sega office was located?
4420425	4437729	San Francisco oh yeah I've driven by there yeah a lot of us have it's right there off I-80 you can't miss it yeah Sega Studios San Francisco has been closed they were making the Iron Man movie tie-in games Golden Axe, Beast Rider unfortunately the rumors were going around and they closed it that one hits very close to home that's a bummer
4439252	4443673	I thought Sega was having a resurgence in popularity with Bayonetta.
4443693	4447014	God, that game they showed, Resonance of Fate, was that what it was called?
4447295	4447875	At PAX East?
4447995	4449775	Actually, it looked pretty rad, I gotta say.
4450736	4454797	So Sega's having a renaissance, but I guess the Iron Man movie tie-in games are not exactly how to do it.
4455976	4460598	I don't know if it's something I would spend the extra money on, but I think it's cool.
4460618	4464019	Like, it's cool that the game's kind of coming to the US at all.
4484787	4492094	You know, like, we just talked about how I think it was getting a limited edition in Japan, but I guess this whole, actually this giant collection is only like 50 bucks.
4492114	4492835	That's not bad.
4493215	4501563	Again, can't say I'm a huge fan of it, so I don't know if I could justify spending that kind of money, but I think it's cool that it's even coming out at all.
4502304	4502764	So that's neat.
4504318	4505879	Maybe a friend of mine will get it and I can check it out.
4505919	4507299	I don't know.
4507539	4512982	Alex P. Carson says, your OLR logo is my Xbox gamer picture.
4513022	4513542	Well, thank you.
4513862	4519564	Did you know, and it's been a long time, but you can actually search for what's called community gamer pics on Xbox Live.
4519604	4520705	And we're in the pack two.
4520805	4522065	It's like the all games radio pack.
4522606	4523066	It has...
4523706	4524627	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4547905	4549668	Evil Protagonist says, I don't have a topic.
4549708	4552694	I just want to tell you all how much I look forward to listening each and every week.
4552734	4553375	Thanks for all you do.
4553536	4554237	Aw, thank you.
4554778	4557563	That's very nice and I apologize for this week's show because it's kind of shit.
4559008	4562730	BlueSwim also says, Rob, your mom's burn on the OLR listeners was epic.
4562770	4563830	Yeah, well, that's where I get it.
4565351	4569092	Lastly, Spazinator, our good buddy, asks a WTF question.
4569453	4575235	If Major Nelson is the mouth of Microsoft, who is the asshole or appendix of Microsoft?
4575855	4576596	Ooh, that's a good one.
4576636	4578337	Who's the asshole of Microsoft?
4579717	4607963	um my best guess I mean I don't think there's anybody who's just like a straight up jerk that I can think of but definitely a lot of what comes out of Peter Molyneux's mouth is so that would be my best guess for you there it is ah Rob you know what I just got done typing what's that she'll cut a bitch for what it's a Kathy Griffin album oh isn't that a book or something
4610127	4612569	No, I think that it's one of our shows.
4613310	4613650	Oh, okay.
4615571	4618093	A couple more news stories for you guys, and we have the classic game of the week.
4618133	4618833	Yeehaw.
4619654	4623737	Microsoft, speaking of which, well, this is kind of an asshole thing to do, but not really.
4623777	4624577	I get why they're doing it.
4624938	4628760	They are suing Datel over the TurboFire controller.
4629501	4633023	It's Wildfire is what it's called in the UK, which is where Datel is from.
4633404	4637867	Unfortunately, they say, you know what, this looks a little bit too much like an Xbox 360 controller, and I gotta say...
4638747	4648253	Yeah, it definitely kind of looks like an Xbox 360 controller, but I kind of always thought the third-party controllers all resembled the original controllers somewhat.
4649154	4658000	But yeah, Microsoft is seeking monetary compensation and an injunction preventing the company from manufacturing any more of the devices.
4658420	4662102	Now, Datel and Microsoft, they've been going back and forth for a little while.
4662522	4666464	I would guess that this was not a licensed Microsoft peripheral and that's part of the problem.
4666684	4671326	Because you might remember Datel, they made the memory cards that got the shaft from Microsoft.
4671366	4676549	So I think that's what this... This is just these two companies just kind of going back and forth at each other.
4677669	4680830	It's a bummer because maybe the D-pad on this thing would have been better.
4680910	4684191	And judging from the looks of it, it doesn't look so like a round D-pad.
4684251	4685571	It might have actually been a little better.
4686511	4687152	Kind of a bummer.
4688192	4689212	But hey, you know what?
4689872	4692913	Microsoft, you know, they did make that controller and they patented it.
4692973	4697634	And if you make something a little too close, that's why people get sued.
4697675	4700535	Especially when you're not already in the company's good favor.
4702336	4702816	I don't know.
4702836	4703516	Sony's gonna sue.
4704456	4705397	Everybody loves to sue.
4705957	4706697	Alright, DarkSakura.
4708878	4710120	I wish I could sue my face.
4712343	4712824	What a quote.
4714186	4720655	So there's an MMO that's called PokéNet that was a fan-run MMORPG based on Pokémon.
4721536	4721696	And...
4724125	4730088	It was... Actually, Nintendo sent the request for them to shut it down at the end of March.
4731209	4739013	And they postponed closing it, but they actually formally shut it down on April Fool's Day.
4740915	4741735	And... And that's no joke.
4743997	4748523	There's just a number of them that have been shut down, but this is just the newest one.
4748623	4755652	And then they said, for the code that they created for the game, they're joking about using it for Digimon or Monster Ranger.
4757014	4758396	But most of their devs are giving up.
4759178	4761179	That would be a funny little FU, I suppose.
4762000	4763941	That's a bummer, but it's not a surprise.
4764081	4767464	Pokemon is one of Nintendo's most treasured MMOs.
4768104	4772667	I see that these guys are just trying to make the game that everybody wants, which is the Pokemon MMO.
4773007	4775169	That's what tons and tons of gamers everywhere want.
4775209	4776470	We've talked about it on this show.
4776930	4781053	It would be a great thing for the franchise, and for whatever reason, Nintendo is just refusing to do it.
4782934	4786917	Probably because of the fact that it's a kid-based game, and that would be very hard to keep safe and clean.
4787237	4788298	That's probably part of the reason.
4788898	4802832	but I mean it's a bummer but I think Nintendo's within their rights certainly you know especially if it wasn't a quality product but I do think if the guys are that passionate about the product they should go back and make it a different type of monster
4803615	4830130	I mean that would take a lot of re-art and all that stuff and plus if it's too close to the Pokemon idea it might still get the smackdown but I mean Pokemon and Digimon can coexist and you know they're not that different I mean yes there's differences but they come down to little pocket monsters and collecting catch them all yada yada but Nintendo's done that a lot lately they shut down the Zelda project the movie thing remember that
4833664	4834426	I get it.
4835027	4835649	They have a right.
4836451	4841723	You can't just go around making all this fake stuff because somebody out there is going to think it's real and that's where the real problems start.
4842813	4848655	Well, this was real, and this was licensed by Nintendo, and no matter what, Nintendo will never make this go away.
4849056	4850436	The Super Mario Bros.
4850476	4851316	Super Show!
4851437	4863261	That's right, the one with, rest in peace, Captain Lou Albano, starred as Mario, and of course, you know, they would do all these cute little live-action skits, and then they had the cartoons.
4863602	4868043	Well, if you want to relive this from your childhood, or if you never got to experience this as a child to begin with, guess what?
4868123	4868764	It's on Netflix!
4869924	4871265	So you can actually go check this out.
4871325	4873206	I believe it is on instant Netflix right now.
4873266	4877929	So you can go stream volume one of the collection and check out what you missed as a kid.
4877989	4880490	I actually have either volume one or volume two.
4880550	4885633	I have one of the collections on DVD and it is so cheesy cheeserific.
4886094	4886754	It's amazing.
4887574	4890796	Just to give you a clue how amazing, here's a blast from the past.
4890836	4891117	Listen up.
4892628	4896111	Hey Bizanos, it's the Mario Brothers Super Show!
4896131	4898133	You'll be hooked on the brothers.
4916834	4918375	Do you ever watch this show growing up, Jamie?
4918835	4922697	Yes, except I was really religious about watching Zelda on Friday.
4922717	4923257	Yeah, me too.
4924417	4926919	Well, excuse me, princess.
4927339	4931060	I don't believe that is a part of this because the Zelda collection's different.
4932761	4934022	Zelda was on a different DVD.
4936043	4937523	And I don't know if you can stream those yet.
4941065	4942966	And the chatroom's bitching about the audio quality.
4943006	4943486	Well, boo-hoo.
4946992	4957943	all right anyhow it's that part of the show where we really like to take a look back at classic gaming's history and pick one game to spotlight in a segment we call our classic game of the week
4959167	4966471	DarkSakura is going to dig through the gaming vaults, she's going to dive in head first, and she's going to sniff really loud, and whatever sticks to her nose first will be the game of the week.
4967432	4970774	So DarkSakura, what did NosePond pick as the game of the week?
4971734	4975076	Actually, it was Dan that picked the game, so you can blame him.
4976077	4979278	I think it's a fabulous game you picked this week, so I thank Dan for this.
4980039	4984121	Well, it's Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island.
4984761	4987003	Aw yeah, one of the best ones in the whole damn series.
4987972	4988372	Wee!
4988813	4989273	Wee!
4989773	4990234	Wee!
4990814	4991255	Wee!
4992696	4992976	Anyway.
4995958	5000262	Basically, you go around as Yoshi and you have baby Mario on your back.
5000682	5001963	And you can play different Yoshis.
5004845	5007127	It's supposed to be a prequel for Super Mario World, though.
5007828	5008769	Technically, by the story.
5009469	5013332	But I mean, your life bar is your baby Mario when he falls off your back.
5013773	5016735	You have to go, he floats around in a little bubble and you have to go catch him.
5017176	5022180	And he gives the single most annoying cry ever.
5026524	5029046	Seriously, I think this game scared me away from children for a long time.
5031005	5033167	Um... But, I mean, you go through.
5033187	5036831	There's also, uh... Eating certain enemies give you certain colored eggs.
5036871	5037592	You can throw them.
5037632	5040815	You can eat certain enemies and shoot them just right back at themselves.
5042176	5045379	And, um... This is a pretty fun little game.
5045860	5045920	Um...
5047701	5065964	and also if you get a perfect score in all 8 of the regular levels you'll get a secret level and there are 5 flowers that you can pick up in each stage and you have red coins and all kinds of fun stuff that you can find um
5069674	5076456	So basically, you have to go and get baby Luigi back from Magikoopa Comic.
5077276	5081397	It also uses the Super FX 2 for sprite scaling and polygon effects.
5082958	5085478	And all kinds of stuff.
5087719	5087879	But...
5089685	5115793	It was actually, the particular style for it, the rumor is that it came from an internal evaluation committee conflict with the Nintendo, and Miyamoto was instructed to use the Donkey Kong Country style of pre-rendered graphics, and so he altered them to look as if they had been drawn with crayons.
5118846	5119427	Interesting.
5119687	5121609	I always thought this game kind of had a unique look to it.
5121649	5123190	That's kind of cool that that's where it came from.
5126313	5126793	Very cool.
5126813	5127294	So that's it?
5127679	5131441	Yeah, that actually was given the award for Best Game of 1995 by EGM.
5132421	5132901	It is a great game.
5132921	5140925	As far as sequels, though, we've had Yoshi Touch and Go and Yoshi's Universal Graviton for the Game Boy Advance.
5140945	5141665	I remember Touch and Go.
5141685	5144707	And then Yoshi's Story came out on Nintendo 64.
5145707	5148829	There was Yoshi's Island DS.
5149949	5156012	Yoshi's Island was used in the SNES and Game Boy versions of Tetris Attack as a background game.
5158288	5158949	Is this on the Wii?
5159449	5160089	I don't think it is.
5160269	5160689	I don't think so.
5160729	5161410	I could be wrong.
5161750	5163211	I'm sure the chatters will correct me if I'm wrong.
5163231	5164011	I don't think it is on the Wii.
5165071	5165272	No.
5165772	5166452	But that's it.
5166552	5167272	It's Yoshi.
5167813	5169754	This is also the game with Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy.
5170014	5171975	And that was an amazing moment in gaming history.
5172715	5176097	If you don't know what Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy is, I'm sure... It's got to be on YouTube somewhere, right?
5176797	5177477	Please tell me it's on YouTube.
5177497	5177697	Hold on.
5177817	5178077	Maybe.
5178478	5179018	Touch...
5180509	5181209	Fuzzy.
5181910	5182270	There it is.
5183430	5184591	I can't type today.
5184631	5187292	I'm sick and there's earthquakes and I can't type.
5187732	5188232	Okay, here we go.
5188652	5189533	Touch Fuzzy, get dizzy.
5189853	5195455	And this is the level that's hilarious because when you would touch these big fuzzy looking things, then your guy would just go psycho.
5195475	5196136	It was amazing.
5198917	5204059	See, I think this is like a speed run.
5204099	5204639	How about this one?
5204659	5205780	Touch Fuzzy, get stoned.
5208281	5208821	What is this?
5211880	5212520	Fucking people.
5212540	5214822	Apparently someone put in clips of a Raiden DX.
5215002	5215582	Apparently.
5216443	5222586	Because that has everything to do with Super Mario Bros.
5222626	5223527	Comments from our chat room.
5224328	5227249	Shaoran says, that game, it kicked my ass.
5227289	5228150	I'm not afraid to admit it.
5228210	5231872	TigerClaw said, never played this game, but it seems like Nintendo always retconned the Mario games.
5231912	5234374	So Mario and Luigi knew about the Mushroom Kingdom since they were toddlers.
5235649	5236631	They were that young.
5236891	5237713	They wouldn't have remembered it.
5238334	5241579	Salacious Pops says, I thought it had some kind of new chip in it that they debuted with the game.
5241619	5243161	Yes, it was the FX2 chip, wasn't it?
5243182	5244283	Yeah, it was the Super FX2.
5244424	5244584	Yeah.
5246022	5248763	It made it a bitch to emulate for a long time.
5248783	5252044	I remember that was one of the prized emulated games when it finally happened.
5252984	5257885	Well, believe it or not, we're reaching the end of our show and the part where we're going to open up the Skype line to your calls.
5257905	5260826	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
5261206	5262566	The phone lines are open.
5262606	5263507	We're taking calls right now.
5263547	5267508	It is a short show tonight because as you can tell, we're a little bit sick and out of it tonight.
5267608	5268448	So, yeah.
5269108	5269288	Benadryl
5291294	5292395	Damn it, call us, people.
5293455	5298218	Next week, Loki should be back, and hopefully he won't be sick.
5298238	5301800	He'll be fresh from my birthday beer potluck.
5303021	5303221	Yes.
5303241	5304122	Hopefully I'll be feeling better.
5304242	5306083	I'm having a beer potluck for my birthday.
5306563	5307183	It's going to be awesome.
5307924	5308324	I'm coming.
5310416	5310817	So soon?
5311797	5312037	Shut up.
5312138	5314159	You know what was something we ought to look into for the show, by the way?
5314219	5323584	Last night at the show at Rocky, somebody had this app on their iPhone 3GS that was a Ustream app so you could actually stream video from your iPhone.
5324425	5329508	So you might want to look into that for your phone to see if we can do webcam again with your iPhone.
5329748	5331209	And you could be the camera woman on the show.
5331249	5331509	Maybe.
5331929	5332670	That might be fun.
5334431	5334811	We'll see.
5336973	5337713	Is no one calling in?
5339929	5340630	Nothing's happening?
5342031	5344352	If you want to call in and share a story with us, you can.
5346434	5346894	I don't mind.
5348275	5351358	Alpha Cananogram says I should leave a drunk voicemail from the beer potluck.
5351758	5355781	I'll probably have to drive, so I don't think that'll be happening because I'm a good boy.
5357702	5359963	Some callers are saying that they get the voicemail when they call.
5360083	5362343	Well, nothing is ringing through, so keep trying, folks.
5362723	5366945	Hey, DarkTetsuya is probably calling in trying to talk about WonderCon.
5367125	5368825	Did you know that happened this weekend, WonderCon?
5369005	5372886	A big, big convention that happened in San Francisco over the weekend.
5373346	5374987	It was a huge deal.
5376448	5404106	I think it's like the second biggest comic book convention only next to Comic Con and yeah I was going on in San Francisco this weekend sadly I couldn't go I was in San Francisco but I'm still so sick and I was kind of conned out which is also bad you know what I'm gonna restart Skype just in case something is going wrong with the Skypey thing let me just quit quit quit I'm gonna quit and I'm gonna reboot Skype and we'll see if we get a call
5406254	5409035	Of course, I have to log in because I don't ever save the password.
5411576	5416058	And it is Easter, so it's a little bit slower of a night anyway, so we might not get a lot of calls.
5416098	5417719	Bobby apparently had no calls on his show.
5417759	5418679	I thought he had at least one.
5418699	5421020	I thought he had at least one.
5422481	5426762	Somebody said they were trying to call, but they got a busy signal, so I thought, okay, let's restart Skype and see what happens.
5427203	5427883	It's my mom.
5427923	5429023	She did something.
5429664	5432905	My mother, when she told all the listeners to go outside, basically.
5432925	5433745	She grounded Skype.
5433965	5434265	She did.
5434325	5435506	She put Skype on timeout.
5437563	5437943	Maybe, um...
5466997	5467457	I don't know.
5468238	5469979	Probably doing homework, really.
5470119	5470679	Good times.
5472080	5473980	Non-stop party for you, DarkSakura.
5475821	5476882	What are you studying these days?
5476902	5479643	What are you going to be when you grow up?
5480964	5489888	Hopefully a designer, which I'm already doing now, but I'm working on a website for my Dreamweaver class.
5489908	5490968	Thank God, we're getting a call.
5491609	5492629	Hi, you're on Orange Lines Radio.
5492669	5493069	Who's this?
5494150	5495491	Yar had his revenge.
5496972	5497492	Yars Revenge
5521936	5522537	Astro Smash.
5522817	5523077	Uh-huh.
5523698	5527842	And no, I've been playing Final Fantasy XIII as the real game, quote-unquote, that I've been playing.
5527922	5529884	How far are you into that game at this point?
5531086	5536211	I am on Chapter 10, so if I was on the Xbox 360, I would have just put in Disc 3.
5536571	5539934	Wow, you are way past me because I think I'm on, like, Chapter 9.
5541776	5543218	That's the best place to farm gill.
5543258	5544219	That's the airship, right?
5544899	5545160	No.
5545180	5545220	No.
5545960	5546500	Actually, no.
5546641	5547721	I'm way back then.
5547841	5548702	I'm like maybe chapter 7.
5549182	5550142	I'm in Palimporum.
5550903	5553124	And I just... I got to Hope's dad.
5553984	5555305	Again, I'm not trying to spoil too much.
5555425	5556265	That's where I quit.
5556365	5558907	I got Hope's dad in the little emo scene with that and then I stopped.
5559287	5559867	Like right after that.
5560668	5561288	That's where I'm at.
5561808	5563089	Best place to farm money.
5564874	5571720	All those soldiers drop those credit chips and incentive chips, and those give 500 gil and 2,500 gil each.
5572140	5572961	I'm going to remember that.
5573581	5575723	So when I'm on the airship, I should farm a crap ton of gil.
5576844	5577024	Yes.
5577165	5577625	Pro tip.
5577885	5578326	I like that.
5578426	5578826	Good tip.
5579827	5582089	Any games that you're looking forward to that are coming out in the near future, Bobby?
5583090	5583170	Um...
5585339	5585680	E3 this year?
5598672	5599873	I'm hoping to go to E3.
5599893	5603156	I did finally get my tax return so I can finally start booking things.
5603656	5609221	I couldn't go to PAX East because I decided buying a house was more important.
5609361	5611482	Priorities.
5611583	5614745	I'm still a renter so I had that disposable income that you needed.
5616767	5617688	I'm definitely going to E3.
5617828	5618528	I'm making it happen.
5619989	5622251	Have you guys talked about the Blur beta at all?
5622411	5623432	A little bit.
5623672	5624593	I have played it.
5624693	5625474	What do you want to say about it?
5627121	5634346	I still haven't figured out if it's insanely good or insanely bad yet.
5634986	5635506	Why is that?
5635947	5637007	What makes the game insane?
5638048	5640589	Well, it's Mario Kart meets Need for Speed.
5641550	5642010	Which is a great idea.
5642030	5643031	That's basically what the game is.
5644031	5646313	And it depends on the map that you're playing.
5648280	5655204	If it's fair or not, if you're not extremely good at it or know all the sight lines and all that stuff.
5656945	5660268	And what sucks is that I'm only good at one map and that's the one map nobody chooses.
5661729	5663070	But it is fun.
5663210	5667472	It's actually a game I don't mind playing with random people because I just don't listen to them.
5668873	5669314	I don't either.
5669334	5671315	I just don't turn on my headset when I'm playing that game.
5672456	5674297	But do you think you'll pick up the full version when it comes out?
5675706	5680808	I will at least rent it because I want to see how the single player is.
5680868	5682408	I'm still looking forward to Split Second.
5682988	5683388	Oh, yeah.
5683408	5690911	But what worries me about Split Second is that I don't want... Because I loved Full Auto.
5691960	5694583	because the demo I played at E3 was amazing.
5694623	5695244	It was awesome.
5695264	5695664	It was great.
5695704	5697647	Then I got the game and I didn't like it all that much.
5697667	5699148	I know Loki did, but he's not there.
5700870	5707498	But I'm afraid Split Second made an amazing demo and the rest of the game won't live up to it.
5707818	5709160	And I'm really afraid of that.
5709440	5717808	Well, you know what's interesting is that they were parading split second around PAX East, and it looks like they brought the same damn booth to PAX East that they had at E3, although it was configured differently for the space.
5718488	5720370	I think it was the same demo, too.
5720410	5725835	I can't say that with 100% certainty because I don't remember that far back, but I think it was the same darn demo that we had at E3.
5726676	5728377	So it's interesting that this game is still not out.
5728437	5732520	At the airport or something where the control tower's crashing around you and stuff?
5732540	5733581	Yes, it seemed like it.
5733641	5736483	I mean, I honestly didn't really play it again.
5736523	5739305	I watched for a little bit, and it just seemed the same to me.
5739325	5740606	It looked like I was looking at the same thing.
5742247	5746971	But I don't pick out a lot of those little graphical things and things like that.
5746991	5751034	I mean, imagine it has to be a newer version, but it was probably like the same stages or something.
5751869	5780830	not really because I guess looking from a game developer point of view they're not going to spend too much more resources just to show kids at PAX East true because the PAX demo at PAX Prime was the same as the E3 demo so it's very possible that they just instead of spending the money making a new demo they're trying to get the game out in time because I think it's supposed to come out before E3 so they're not going to spend time making a new E3 demo no
5782494	5789041	I can't see them for PAX East, unfortunately.
5789621	5796328	I can't see them spending all that time making a new demo when they have a perfectly good one from E3 that is impressive.
5796728	5797189	That's true.
5797409	5801633	And probably a lot of people that were at that expo had never played it before because it was a totally different crowd.
5802254	5802434	Yeah.
5803973	5808816	Well, Bobby, anything else on your mind before we try to go back and see if we get any other calls tonight?
5808876	5809896	Or maybe it'll just be you.
5809956	5810297	Who knows?
5811477	5811917	Yar.
5812358	5812818	Yar.
5812958	5814619	I'm going to work on that this week, Bobby.
5814899	5820002	Like I told you on your show, I've never been better at Yar's Revenge of My Life until you inspired me to kick your butt.
5821761	5822841	and you haven't kicked it yet.
5822921	5823882	I'm trying.
5824062	5825302	I've one-upped you a couple times.
5825422	5826143	I've made you work.
5826683	5827343	You have to admit that.
5827783	5828424	I made you work.
5829224	5829744	Yes, you did.
5829924	5830484	Alright, there you go.
5830764	5833365	And then you bowed down and... Alright, shut up.
5834226	5835246	Somebody else call in.
5835306	5836066	Don't make it just me.
5836326	5837187	Alright, have a good one, Bobby.
5837887	5838207	See ya.
5838948	5839929	Alright, so we know it works.
5839989	5840629	Bobby got through.
5840649	5841710	At least the Skype line works.
5841730	5842370	We know that much.
5842470	5843611	I know it calls out okay.
5843651	5844732	We called my mommy earlier.
5844752	5848555	877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
5849055	5858342	I'm starting to feel like really headachy so I don't know how much longer we can keep this show going but we're gonna try to get at least one more call in on our Skype line.
5860000	5876717	and then we're going to wrap up the show we will be back next week with an all new edition of Orange Lounge Radio of course same bat time, same bat channel I think I mentioned it a minute ago but I should make sure to plug this because after all we do steal the man's bandwidth every week our old putty putty, silly putty
5878018	5883960	Our old buddy, Scott Rubin, who hosts, he's kind of the grand poobah, if you will, of All Games Radio.
5884000	5891323	He is starting his own little show, but it's actually a big show, at Appaday.tv, and he's reunited with Diane Miazota.
5891363	5893084	It's like G4 back when they were cool.
5893184	5893864	Hey, we're getting a call.
5895284	5896245	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5896265	5896625	Who's this?
5898746	5899766	This is Henderson, man.
5899866	5900986	Well, hi, Henderson, man.
5901026	5901547	How are you?
5902767	5903587	I'm doing all right.
5903727	5904608	Welcome to the show.
5904668	5904748	Hi.
5905868	5907270	Yeah, I've been a long-time listener.
5907330	5908972	I've probably listened for like the last two years.
5909012	5914579	In fact, it was your show that introduced me to All Games Radio years ago.
5915020	5919285	And now I have my own live show on Saturdays on All Games.
5919465	5920066	What is your show?
5921455	5923938	Distributed Failure, we come on at 3 p.m.
5925219	5927261	Pacific time on Saturdays.
5927562	5928783	I have heard of that program.
5928823	5929664	Congratulations.
5929724	5931246	That is awesome.
5931386	5933408	So make sure Scott knows that.
5933448	5933828	That's good.
5933848	5937312	People have heard of us.
5937332	5937813	That's awesome.
5938133	5939554	Well, what is on your mind, my friend?
5940055	5941256	What do we owe the phone call tonight?
5942317	5955890	I just wanted to say, you know, you guys look like you're having trouble with Skype, and I just wanted to call in and say hey, and tell you guys I'm a long-time listener, and I did finish Final Fantasy XIII, which I thought was decent, but I still think it's low on the totem pole of Final Fantasy games.
5956550	5957411	Not as low as VIII.
5957531	5961275	I think VIII is the worst Final Fantasy game ever created.
5961375	5963597	You and I can agree on at least one thing, that's for sure.
5965999	5981027	I would rather play I didn't care much for 7 either but I did love 9 I think 9 is one of the best at least it's the best one on the PS1 era I would rather level a character from 1 through 75 on Final Fantasy 11 than play 5 more minutes of Final Fantasy 8
5982268	5989412	I even bought the PSN version to try to go back and finish it because it's like one of the only ones I've never finished and I couldn't do it.
5989852	5991433	I still couldn't get to our first disc.
5991813	6003119	What made me mad originally when I played it is I got to a section of the game and it's kind of spoiler-ish but not really because basically... There's only a six month moratorium on spoilers and it's passed so spoil away.
6003459	6024537	Okay, your female character that's supposed to be your girlfriend in the game, I can't think of her name right now, but there's a section of the game where you go to a location because she gets taken, and when she gets taken, she's in this tower where all the enemies are level 1, and you're supposed to have a special summons or whatever that can raise the levels so you can gain levels.
6024997	6031522	Well, I got stuck at a boss there and couldn't get past the boss because the boss was too tough, but I couldn't gain any levels because everything was like level 1.
6032903	6039765	and I tried to leave and it wouldn't let you leave so I got stuck in this endless loop and I just eventually couldn't do anything so I just quit playing the game.
6039825	6041306	Stupid ass system in that game.
6041366	6042686	Just a dumb ass system.
6042746	6054250	I mean the whole weapon system was ridiculous where you had to go around finding these items to upgrade your weapon so basically every battle in that game ended up being oh I'll just summon this monster that takes forever to watch all of its animation.
6054931	6056453	Wonderful story, though.
6056493	6057035	I will say this.
6057055	6058517	Final Fantasy VIII had a great story.
6058898	6060742	They should have just made it the movie, honestly.
6061423	6062505	They should have just made it the movie.
6063573	6070577	Yeah, it did have a great story, but yeah, that was, the gameplay ruined that game so, so much.
6070617	6081283	And I try to go back to it on PSP, and it actually looks decent on PSP, which is amazing because, you know, it is a PlayStation 1 game, but that smaller screen and everything being so compact, it does make the graphics stand out.
6081383	6082003	It makes it better.
6082964	6085565	Even Yars' Revenge looks awesome on my LCD monitor.
6085665	6092329	Like, you know, there's just a certain, there's just something to it that we didn't have back in, you know, back in the day of gaming.
6092549	6096971	I've been tempted to play that game because I remember playing that game when I was like five and six years old, dude.
6097251	6101652	And I just remember you go in that little middle section and the bullets wouldn't hurt you and all that.
6101852	6108454	But man, I picked up Adventure on there, but I haven't tried it yet.
6108915	6111335	I had to pick it up because, you know, it's Adventure.
6111855	6116237	And then I also picked up Crystal Castle, which is kind of hard to control on that.
6116599	6120844	Yeah, because that game needs a trackball, not an analog stick.
6121024	6123807	I can't imagine that that... I haven't played that one yet, I'll be honest.
6123827	6130554	I've kind of avoided it because I know it can't control that well, but I worry about the whole trackball versus analog stick.
6130814	6135318	But Yars' Revenge, seriously, best five bucks I've spent on Xbox Live in the past six months.
6135599	6135759	Yeah.
6136152	6136372	GameRoom
6156747	6157287	Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Age
6184147	6186850	Are you a bad enough dude to eat a cheeseburger with the mayor?
6188392	6189594	The president.
6189614	6191937	Yeah, the mayor was final fight.
6192417	6192938	That's okay, though.
6193676	6200643	And then that'll get a lot of eyes back on Game Room, but hopefully they get all their stinking server problems figured out by that point.
6201444	6204687	Hey, did you happen to see that Data East collection that came out on Wii?
6204787	6205848	I don't know if that's came out yet or not.
6205888	6210172	It's got BurgerTime and Bad Dudes on there, so that's why I'm kind of hoping it'll come to Game Room.
6210312	6210752	It does.
6213575	6217479	I haven't played it myself, but I believe it has the sequel to BurgerTime as well.
6219716	6220656	I love me some BurgerTime.
6220676	6221957	I've been tempted to try to find that.
6223979	6225980	So it seems like a pretty good deal.
6226000	6227981	I haven't played it myself, but it'll be pretty cool.
6228201	6232064	Oh yeah, DarkTetsu's reminding me in chat, NARC is M-rated anyway, so it can't come to Game Room.
6232644	6233085	Whatever.
6233665	6234345	Technicality.
6235266	6236567	Just turn the blood into sweat.
6236627	6238088	That's what they did back in my day.
6238408	6241170	All right, Henderson, man, we're going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call.
6241470	6242391	But thanks so much for the call.
6242551	6246193	And distributed failure... Distributed fail... I'm sick.
6246273	6247674	Distributed... Distributed failure.
6247694	6248095	Failure.
6249155	6249996	and DarkSakura.com.
6271695	6277605	I said you can find the archives at distributedfailure.com so if anybody wants to listen and check it out, it's there.
6277665	6279147	And we're live on Saturdays.
6279468	6280910	Best of luck with your show, sir.
6282172	6282633	Alrighty.
6282913	6283694	Thank you very much, guys.
6283714	6285818	Tell the crew at Distributed Failure we all said hey.
6287361	6288341	Alright, and bye, Jamie.
6288701	6289002	Alright.
6289022	6289682	Bye.
6290862	6291262	Take care.
6292563	6293303	Alright, sniffle sniffle.
6293323	6294984	Let's try to get at least one more call in.
6295044	6295364	I don't know.
6295384	6296744	Something seems to be borked with the phone.
6297004	6299485	The actual phone people, I think, are having problems tonight.
6299585	6300165	I don't know why.
6301146	6302426	You all heard me call my mother.
6303686	6304767	It seemed to be working fine.
6305327	6306888	So, I don't know what's up.
6307088	6308188	Your guess is as good as mine.
6310097	6322006	We'll give it just a couple more minutes for a call to come in, and if it doesn't come in, then I'll just chalk up the phone's not working to just yet another thing going wrong today between the earthquakes and the rainstorm and the plague.
6322446	6323787	Do you think Zombie Jesus did it?
6324788	6326249	Apparently, Ranma's trying to call in.
6326569	6327830	DarkTetsuya's trying to call in.
6328290	6329971	I think Spazinator on Twitter said he was going to call in.
6330011	6331733	Something appears to be wrong with the phone line itself.
6331793	6332433	I don't know what it is.
6332473	6332833	Like, watch.
6332893	6336276	I bet if I call... Like, I don't know.
6339475	6343620	Watch, I'm going to call my cell right now.
6347685	6348285	It's calling.
6351129	6351990	And there, my phone's ringing.
6353080	6353440	There it is.
6353881	6355463	It's working.
6356143	6356524	I don't know.
6356544	6358326	The phone's stupid.
6359967	6360728	It's the earthquakes.
6361409	6362410	Let's blame it on the earthquakes.
6364632	6365013	All right.
6365093	6366935	Well, sorry, guys.
6366975	6367596	I don't know what to do.
6367656	6373862	I guess we're just going to have to close up shop for the night and blame the earthquakes for taking down Skype tonight.
6375049	6402300	you can always leave voicemails send us emails as well mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com I know DarkSakura probably wanted to call in to talk about WonderCon but he also did a fabulous write up that's available on the site orangeloungeradio.com if you want to read that he has a whole little wrap up on WonderCon hopefully we'll get some of these people in next week I'm sure Ranma wanted to call in to talk about Anime Boston I know he was there but sadly Skype got earthquakeed or something I don't know what's going on
6402922	6404672	Shaoran in chat says, blame it on the rain.
6404793	6405055	I will.
6405731	6411194	Blame it on the rain Blame it on the rain Blame it on the rain
6434444	6437465	DarkSakura, thanks for being here and sticking it out through the show.
6437706	6438146	I live here.
6438486	6438746	I know.
6438786	6439987	Do you have a final thought tonight?
6441787	6442868	My Ben Angel's kind of working.
6444109	6448751	My final thought is Mucinex is my friend, and I'm going to go take some more right now.
6449211	6450311	Have a great night, everybody.
6450351	6455014	We'll see you next week with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio that won't be so broken.
6455274	6457875	And have a plan in case of an earthquake.
6458075	6458615	Just saying.
6459296	6459696	Just saying.
6459716	6462017	Over this next week, have your earthquake plan prepared.
6462617	6462937	Good night!
6489498	6491523	But we're probably right anyway.
6492104	6492946	See you next week!
