0	20820	Tonight, April 4th, 2010, a theft occurs at PAX East, Linux gets taken away on the PS3,
20820	31800	and Nintendo puts the snack down on the end of the whole fans were waiting for.
31800	37600	Hello my friends, and welcome to episode number 361 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game
37600	40840	talk show where every gamer has a voice, except the host.
40840	44820	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my lovely
44820	48400	co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
48400	49400	Uh...
49400	50400	I know, right?
50400	52060	We'll get into that later.
52060	53060	It's not a good night.
53060	54720	Seriously, we should just phone tonight's episode in.
54720	55720	I don't...
55720	56720	What the hell are we doing?
56720	59580	We should just, like, throw the show roll in the toilet and just do whatever.
59580	63160	If this is the first show you've ever listened to of Orange Lounge Radio, please go back
63160	68280	in the iTunes archives and select another, because it's just gonna be one of those nights
68280	69280	that I can already tell.
69280	70280	This...
70280	71280	We had the fuck show already.
71280	73320	This is the fuck it show.
73320	74320	Not here tonight.
74320	76480	Sometimes that's some of our best work, though, so we'll see what happens.
76480	77600	Not here tonight.
77600	80000	Tagmaster Loki, sadly, is not here.
80000	84020	I think he's got a holiday dinner thing going on, which is strange because the wife is Jewish,
84020	85020	but whatever.
85020	86020	There's a dinner in the...
86020	87020	But it may be his family.
87020	88020	No, I know.
88020	89020	It is.
89020	90020	I'm pretty sure it is his family.
90020	91020	So, you know.
91020	92020	And he...
92020	93020	The man deserves a night off once in a while.
93020	94620	I wonder if Nellie's observing Passover.
94620	95620	I have no idea.
95620	96620	If...
96620	97620	Well, no, she can't be, because...
97620	98620	Yeah, never mind.
98620	99620	Well, anyhow.
99620	103040	Uh, and one thing I should say about Loki, you know, I'm sure he wanted to tell you all
103040	105360	this on the show, but he posted it on Twitter.
105360	106360	And when I say...
106360	107540	You post it on Twitter?
107540	110640	CNN can report on it, so therefore it's fair game, right?
110640	111780	Nellie is pregnant again.
111780	113440	So congratulations to Loki.
113440	116520	The pictures were kind of scary, because I could see bones.
116520	118240	That's what babies look like when they're in the...
118240	120240	And they're growing inside of you.
120240	125160	And just so you guys know, not only is Nellie pregnant, she's, what, about 20 weeks?
125160	128880	I mean, they waited, I mean, understandably, if you don't know what happened before...
128880	131160	They waited until it was a viable pregnancy.
131160	132160	Yes.
132160	133640	They wanted to wait this time to say anything.
133640	135760	So she's about 20 weeks along at this point.
135760	139280	I think they already know it's a boy, and just, it's one this time, it's not 20.
139280	140280	I saw the pee-pee.
140280	141280	So, what's that?
141280	143000	They pointed to the pee-pee on the ultrasound.
143000	144000	Did they?
144000	145000	Oh, okay, yeah.
145000	146000	And the hand in the hand.
146000	147000	Nellie would do that.
147000	148000	That's a very Nellie thing to do.
148000	149000	Well, no, they usually do that.
149000	150000	The doctors will...
150000	151000	Look at my kid's penis!
151000	152000	Woo!
152000	154360	The doctors will, like, usually point stuff out on the ultrasound.
154360	155360	Okay.
155360	156360	All right.
156360	157360	I'm gonna make you some dinner.
157360	158360	No, but in all seriousness...
158360	159360	Like a good woman should.
159360	160360	Bite my ass.
160360	161360	Oh, I just did that.
161360	164520	Actually, if you want something more disgusting, bite my sinus cavity.
164520	165640	All right.
165640	166640	So great.
166640	168400	I get to monologue with the listeners for a little while.
168400	169400	This should be fun.
169400	170400	No, I'll do my gaming week.
170400	171760	I can hear you from the other room, Rob.
171760	172760	I know you can.
172760	173760	And you'll hear...
173760	174760	We'll be good.
174760	176320	I'll talk to the chatters tonight.
176320	177880	I'll talk to the chatters.
177880	178880	Hi, chatters.
178880	183800	So, yes, Loki is, chat.orangehonstrader.com, by the way, if you want to join our chat room.
183800	187040	There's no Loki here tonight because he's having a nice family dinner, and obviously
187040	189640	they have reasons to celebrate, so good for them.
189640	190840	He'll be back next week.
190840	194520	So it's just, right now, it's just you and me, folks.
194520	198400	You and the guys in the chat room, chat.orangehontrader.com, and we'll be opening up the Skype line a
198400	199400	little later on.
199400	204280	Now, here's the other part that's, I guess, just hilarious of what's going on right now,
204280	205660	is that I am sick.
205660	208120	You can probably tell my voice sounds a little bit out of it.
208120	211760	And Dark Sakura, you can hear her blowing her nose like in China.
211760	214560	Like, go download Bobby's show from this week.
214560	216440	It sounded like an earthquake going on back there.
216440	221480	So dark as she's screaming at me from the kitchen.
221480	225360	So dark, it's like, this is like the Dark Sakura and Sky are married edition.
225360	226360	What is going on here?
226360	228320	You're yelling at me from the kitchen.
228320	233640	You're cooking me dinner.
233640	236720	This is the- Rob is officially my gay husband.
236720	238280	This is definitely an April Fool's edition.
238280	240040	Rob is my complimentary spouse.
240040	241040	Fist bump.
241040	242840	You just fist bumped me.
242840	248080	Rob is, Rob can be my complimentary spouse at Sam's Club.
248080	250240	Can I talk about fist bumping for a minute?
250240	251480	Okay, PAX East.
251480	254720	Ain't no one want to shake my hand at PAX East for whatever reason.
254720	255760	Now, there's a couple of people.
255760	258640	But I noticed the big thing to do is fist bumping.
258640	261680	Like that's how people say hello now is they fist bump.
261680	266280	And like, surely that's a sign I'm getting old is that I don't want to fist bump.
266280	268580	Like back in my day, we shake hands.
268580	270360	Like I'm not going to- But not when you're sick.
270360	275040	Well, A, I wasn't sick during the con and B, I already had swine flu in October.
275040	276240	So I'm not going to have it again.
276240	277240	I did too.
277240	278240	Oops.
278240	281200	I'm not cooking dinner.
281200	282880	I'll let everyone know what Rob is having.
282880	285360	It's the same thing I'm having.
285360	291640	It's an Ezekiel 4-9 tortilla, so there's no gluten and no yeast in it.
291640	293400	With some garlic hummus.
293400	294400	All this healthy crap.
294400	295560	Baby spinach.
295560	296760	Fresh baby spinach.
296760	298440	The wife's making me eat healthy tonight.
298440	299440	And yogurt cheese.
299440	302760	Because I will say more about this later.
302760	304120	Everyone knows I have digestion problems.
304120	305880	I think I figured out what's causing it.
305880	306880	All right.
306880	308280	That's right.
308280	311280	And Rob in the chat room says, I got it from the bean bag and shook your hand.
311280	312280	That's true.
312280	313640	No, it was just some people were fist bumping.
313640	324400	Like I don't- I met a blogger who blogs for a site that's commercial and they get paid
324400	325400	for it.
325400	327760	And if I told you the site, you'd all know what it is.
327760	330260	And she wanted to fist bump.
330260	332920	And I was like, oh, okay, is that how we do it back East?
332920	335760	But she was actually from California.
335760	338480	So I didn't, I didn't get it, but I guess maybe it was a virus thing.
338480	339480	I don't know.
339480	340480	I guess.
340480	341480	It was just weird.
341480	342480	It was weird.
342480	343480	All right.
343480	344480	I wasn't used to that whole fist bump thing.
344480	346320	I thought that's what like bros did when they were drunk.
346320	347320	I don't know.
347320	348320	All right.
348320	349320	Anyhow.
349320	350320	Uh, where the hell was I?
350320	351320	I was sick.
351320	352680	Dark soccer is sick.
352680	353680	We're all sick.
353680	354680	Loki's out.
354680	355680	Nellie's pregnant.
355680	358880	There's earthquakes going on in California right now and somewhere there will be video
358880	359880	games involved too.
359880	360880	No, seriously.
360880	361880	There's, there were earthquakes.
361880	363520	There were two of them in California today.
363520	369800	There was a, an earthquake in Baja, Mexico that apparently was felt San Diego, LA, like
369800	371340	all the way to Phoenix.
371340	374160	So just the whole Southwest is shaken.
374160	376960	But thank God it sounds like not a lot of people are hurt.
376960	381160	We heard from the resident Mexican actdeft on the Twitter again, I'm getting my news
381160	382160	from Twitter.
382160	384680	What's the world coming to actdeft apparently is okay.
384680	387920	So I know if he's okay, then it can't be too terrible.
387920	390000	So hopefully everybody is okay.
390000	393500	I know they build a lot of the structures down there to, I mean, it's LA we're talking
393500	394500	about.
394500	396340	So there's a lot of structural integrity down there.
396340	397680	So hopefully everybody's okay.
397680	402960	What I didn't know at the same time, apparently nine minutes later, an aftershock of some
402960	405520	sort hits in NorCal.
405520	409700	Now I'm on the road and I don't know if you know this, but if you're sitting in a car,
409700	412000	you can't feel an earthquake while you're driving.
412000	417560	So if an earthquake happened, I didn't feel it, but it was also only like a 4.1 earthquake
417560	418560	anyway.
418560	422120	So, you know, and you can't even feel it if it's like 3.5.
422120	425960	So I wouldn't have, you know, I wouldn't have really felt it anyway, but the scary part
425960	428920	is I was sitting on the Bay Bridge right when these earthquakes were happening.
428920	432640	And I know this because my sister who is in Long Beach texted me and said, earthquake
432640	433640	lol.
433640	438760	So, thank gosh, I didn't like fall off the bridge if that earthquake had been too much
438760	439760	stronger.
439760	441760	So there you go.
441760	444040	All right.
444040	447040	Some folks in our chat room are chatting about the earthquake.
447040	449760	Fernando, can you hear the drums Fernando?
449760	454720	And our chat room says, I felt the earthquake in San Diego, it was fun, meow.
454720	457480	Amesatsuma says, the earthquake turned my bed into a water bed.
457480	460200	Ray Ananami says, I was sitting, I didn't feel anything.
460200	463680	Well, it was only a 4.1, you may not have felt anything.
463680	467080	Okay, apparently, it's the earthquake show.
467080	468560	It's the freaky crap show tonight.
468560	470120	I don't know what the hell's going on tonight.
470120	471800	We're just like avoiding the topic of games.
471800	473480	All right, we can talk about games.
473480	474480	Let's get into the show.
474480	477320	Let's start it off as we always do with a little bit of how was your gaming week.
477320	482600	And this is dark Sakura is still in the kitchen, but she's bringing ooh, yay, vitamin water.
482600	483600	Thank you.
483600	488000	Now my, when my throat is parched, I will be able to quench it.
488000	489320	Here we go.
489320	493680	So my gaming week, I went to PAX East and hopefully you heard the lovely show that we
493680	494680	did last week.
494680	495680	It's only aired live so far.
495680	497600	It did not because I've been sick.
497600	499080	I didn't get the MP3 posted.
499080	500080	So I apologize.
500080	504560	That'll be posted to OrangeLawnTreaty.com and some of our like Facebook and all that
504560	505560	stuff later this week.
505560	508680	But if you didn't hear the pack show, it was a lot of fun.
508680	511720	Quite a few listeners, uh, met up with me there and it was really just cool to meet
511720	517320	everybody and you see some of the, no, it wasn't, it wasn't that silly, but you know,
517320	518320	we had a good time.
518320	519320	We had a good discussion.
519320	520320	It was fun.
520320	521560	Um, you were a miss dark Sakura as was Loki.
521560	522560	It was a bummer.
522560	523920	You guys couldn't make it show itself.
523920	526960	I don't know if I really actually ended up playing a lot of video games because I didn't
526960	529160	want to wait in line for an hour.
529160	534500	I will say what video games I did play classic gaming arcade, that big famous arcade they
534500	539040	have out there in the east coast fun, fun spot.
539040	540040	That's it.
540040	543360	Fun spot brought some of their arcade machines two packs east.
543360	545080	So I played donkey Kong three.
545080	546080	Heck yeah.
546080	547080	I played that.
547080	550040	I took some pictures of pinball tables for dark Sakura on her Twitter and I played the
550040	553520	Buck Rogers arcade machine that was actually one of the sit down cabinet and that machine
553520	554960	kicked my ass.
554960	561200	So I played some classic games, but as far as, um, uh, being able to take like, uh, I
561200	564400	wasn't going to sit in an hour long line to play red dead redemption.
564400	567720	And I did, it wasn't that excited about crack down to like, I just looked over someone's
567720	569600	shoulder and I'm, I kind of got a feel for it.
569600	571280	Like I didn't like have to play it myself.
571280	572280	I was okay.
572280	579160	So, you know, but I jump in the sequel, it was, it looked like I like jumping with rockets.
579160	581600	Just people blast each other with rockets.
581600	582600	But you know, I had a good time.
582600	586840	I did get dark Sakura present, but unfortunately I neglected to bring it tonight.
586840	591360	But um, it involves a certain card game that people were playing everywhere up and down
591360	593520	the halls in the tabletop area.
593520	596140	And I know it's one of the dark soccer is a fan of magic.
596140	601880	I'm not telling, I'm not telling judgment, lol.
601880	606880	I wish I would've been fun, but I, I had a, I had a, um, I had a good time at packs except
606880	607960	for the omega thon.
607960	609180	Can we talk about the omega thon?
609180	613100	Cause that happened after the pack show.
613100	617120	I'm already starting to get sick Sunday and my friends that I traveled with, my dear friends
617120	620300	say and Amanda, they wanted to wait in line for the omega thon, which I'm like, okay,
620300	622680	I've never watched a final round of megathons.
622680	623680	I'm cool.
623680	625020	I'm like, okay, let's, let's do it.
625020	626020	Let's sit in line.
626020	627060	Let's wait for the final round of megathon.
627060	629900	Let's watch the closing ceremony, see what happens.
629900	634200	So final round of the omega thon supposed to start at five o'clock, right?
634200	639040	Five 30 I noticed we're still sitting in line outside and we are cramped.
639040	640680	We are herded like cattle.
640680	642600	If there was a fire, we would have died.
642600	643600	We would all died.
643600	648480	I mean, it's just, we are in there like so tightly packed and apparently they, they posted
648480	652880	to their Twitter, Oh, we're having problems with the final omega thon game, LOL.
652880	656840	And I'm just sitting there thinking, open the goddamn theater and test behind the curtain.
656840	657840	Let us in.
657840	660400	I'm old and my bones can't take this standing around anymore.
660400	664560	So finally like five 45 they let us in.
664560	668880	We get in there, sit down, wait for things to start, which finally start around six and
668880	671480	then they're like, it's the omega thon.
671480	675120	And you know, and of course it's always this big mystery.
675120	677100	What's the last omega thon thing going to be?
677100	678100	What's the game going to be?
678100	679100	Oh my gosh.
679100	681860	Well, this, this year was a team theme.
681860	685640	The whole omega thon all the way from start to finish was played in teams like little
685640	686640	teams.
686640	688440	They did the whole way from start to finish.
688440	692800	And so it made sense that the last omega thon game was going to be a series of games.
692800	695040	It was a relay race.
695040	699040	So the first game, super Mario brothers collect 50 coins.
699040	701960	Second game, rad racer, get 1500 points.
701960	704440	Third game, Tetris, get 10 lines.
704440	708200	At this point, I'm thinking to myself, I'm watching the Nintendo world championships
708200	710560	about 20 years late.
710560	714240	Actually that sounds like almost the exact order of a Nintendo world championship cartridge.
714240	717700	It was, it was, it was for real fun.
717700	721140	It might've been like some variation in the coin numbers and the lines, but essentially
721140	725440	it was the fricking, um, uh, Nintendo world championships.
725440	730480	But the fourth game they had said would be a co-op game and Ooh, ah, what does it end
730480	731480	up being?
731480	733280	It's Contra.
733280	736960	That's right, eight bit Contra was the final game and they had to play all the way to kill
736960	741880	the first boss, which apparently now when I say kill the first boss in Contra, what
741880	742880	does that mean to you?
742880	745960	How far would you have to play in the game to kill the first boss in Contra?
745960	754600	To the, through the little tunnel part and through to the like the, the very end.
754600	757720	It wasn't the, the little dinky guy sitting in front of the gate at the first stage.
757720	761920	No, see, I took it to mean that I took it to mean stage one, the end of that's the first
761920	763320	boss is the end of stage one, right?
763320	766480	No, but it was all the way to the big orb thing that goes back and forth.
766480	768540	That's really at the end of like stage two.
768540	770280	So that's how far they had to play.
770280	772560	Well, yippy, skippy, without cussing.
772560	775520	No, they could cuss all they wanted.
775520	776520	Good.
776520	777720	Cause that game makes me cuss from the very beginning.
777720	780560	But I guess they'd put the Konami code in so that it wouldn't be that hard.
780560	785000	Well, and then here's the thing, the fucking competition broke twice.
785000	788680	Like they started, the whole thing started with Mario brothers and the second player
788680	790040	side like wouldn't answer.
790040	793820	So they said they had to restart and then they got all the way to Contra and the thing
793820	797040	froze or something and they had to restart the entire competition.
797040	798780	And you know what really sucks?
798780	804000	The team that was ahead the first time lost, wah, wah, wah.
804000	805000	So yeah.
805000	809180	And then they were like, thanks for coming to watch the megathon, PAX East was awesome.
809180	811560	It was more awesome than PAX prime.
811560	813000	See you next year, bitches.
813000	814600	And that was it.
814600	820600	And I'm sitting like, I stood in an hour and like 30 minute line for that, which I could
820600	822680	have read about on the internet in five minutes.
822680	823680	That's stinky.
823680	824680	It was very unfortunate.
824680	827380	I hear past omega-thons have been much better.
827380	831240	That was a very unfortunate low light of PAX.
831240	832840	So there you go.
832840	835640	Anyhow, that was part of my gaming week was PAX.
835640	839200	Otherwise actual games I've been playing during the week, uh, game room, I've been playing
839200	840200	quite a bit of.
840200	842680	Bobby and I have been having a little spar in Yars revenge.
842680	846520	It's like an unsaid competition, but I swear I've played Yars revenge more than any other
846520	847760	game this week.
847760	848760	Game room.
848760	850240	There's a lot I really like about it.
850240	855040	I really, really like that when you do challenges, it saves replays of your friends and that
855040	858920	you can issue challenges and have leaderboards and have these stupid little animations that
858920	861460	your characters do when you win challenges.
861460	864520	And I like that you have the medals that you earn and so forth.
864520	869320	And you know, that despite the fact that tokens don't really get you anything but bonus demo
869320	872040	plays, it's still kind of cool that there's that incentive.
872040	874680	But there's a lot that I don't like about game room too.
874680	880740	And one of them is that the servers never work, which is ridiculous when you're trying
880740	883440	to like get a high score saved or something.
883440	887080	You might have to be hitting the button over and over and sometimes I've, I've lost scores
887080	890240	because the servers literally go up and down and up and down and up and down.
890240	892760	Like it is just atrocious.
892760	897320	So I don't know what is going on with game room, but there's a good game room in there
897320	899020	somewhere.
899020	901640	It's just, you know, they've got a lot of kinks to work out.
901640	905760	Honestly, my, my gut tells me as much as I, there's a lot I do like about game room, they
905760	907320	shouldn't have released it when they did.
907320	910480	They should have waited until things were more stable.
910480	912480	Maybe they had no idea how popular it was going to be.
912480	915280	I don't know, but I think they should have waited until like June.
915280	920320	By the way, pro tip, I find I do better when I play on games for Windows with an Xbox Live
920320	924320	controller or with an Xbox 360 controller than I do on regular Xbox.
924320	928880	And I think part of the reason is that you're sitting right there in front of the monitor,
928880	931000	just like an old school arcade cabinet.
931000	933400	You're not sitting several feet away from your TV.
933400	936640	And I think it does help the precision, especially on a lot of those old games, especially on
936640	941320	things like asteroid deluxe where your bullets are like tiny, tiny, it kind of helps to be
941320	944960	sitting right in front of the monitor as much as my mother would hate that.
944960	946280	So there you go.
946280	948040	Spyro in our chat room says game room is free.
948040	949040	That is true.
949040	951600	The game room engine itself is free and you can get like a good, like, I don't know, like
951600	956040	50 gamers score just for downloading it and putting up decorations in your room.
956040	961680	But you will have to pay at least like $3 to enjoy a game or $5 if you want them to
961680	964100	be multi-platform, which is how I've been buying all my games.
964100	966760	But I do go back and forth between Windows and 360.
966760	969760	And some people might say $5, Rob, you're crazy.
969760	974800	But well, I mean, I paid $5 for Frogger and Joust on the 360 when it first came out.
974800	979020	And I've honestly played Yars' Revenge more than any other game this week.
979020	980020	But I did play some other stuff.
980020	982720	On the plane, I played a Final Fantasy Tactics A2 on the DS.
982720	984080	I borrowed that game.
984080	985080	It's cool.
985080	987080	It's awesome.
987080	988080	Like the way that was set up.
988080	991600	Didn't realize it was part of the Final Fantasy XII canon, but that was kind of nice to play
991600	992600	that.
992600	993840	Had a little bit of fun with that.
993840	998480	And honestly, that's, besides Warcraft and some of the other just little things here
998480	1002000	and there, that's really about it for my gaming week.
1002000	1006840	DarkSakra, oh she who keeps blowing her nose and sinuses over there, how is your gaming
1006840	1007840	week going?
1007840	1010000	I just played some Star Trek Online.
1010000	1014960	I've been taking advantage of my spring break to not be at my computer or not be in front
1014960	1015960	of a TV.
1015960	1023840	I just tried to rest a lot, you know, because I've been so busy with everything and then
1023840	1030000	I was gonna actually make a good start on Final Fantasy II today.
1030000	1033160	And then the allergy monster smacked me in the face, so basically every time I haven't
1033160	1035660	been working on something here, I've been asleep.
1035660	1038400	So I've been playing Dream.
1038400	1041080	I've been playing Benadryl the game.
1041080	1046120	It's where you take Benadryl and see if it'll either make you high or pass out.
1046120	1050160	In my case it was pass out and that's what's happening again because I took another Benadryl.
1050160	1053240	Great, so you took drugs that are gonna make you drowsy during the show.
1053240	1058880	I took drugs so that I could breathe and then Dan gave me a Vix inhaler thing and I love
1058880	1059880	those things.
1059880	1061600	It's a tube you stick up your nose and snort.
1061600	1064000	It looks like a tampon applicator, honestly, from where I'm sitting.
1064000	1065200	It looks like a tampon.
1065200	1066200	It does.
1066200	1068640	It looks like you're shoving a tampon in your nose and pushing a button.
1068640	1069640	That's disgusting.
1069640	1070640	Don't do that.
1070640	1071640	I just stuck it in my nose.
1071640	1072640	Thank God it's radio.
1072640	1074160	This is where all of you in chat are very thankful.
1074160	1077160	I have a camera, Rob.
1077160	1084640	All right, anyhow, where else was I with this, talking about webcams and all that stuff?
1084640	1091520	Oh, I did want to say this about Rocky last night as I went to Rocky and, well, A, Alan
1091520	1096080	was playing a crap ton of Peggle which I thought was cute because it made me think of you.
1096080	1099040	That's one time I thought of you last night and then the other time, are you gonna put
1099040	1103080	that on the OLR blog, I dare you.
1103080	1106180	Dark Soccer never likes pictures of herself to get up on the internet and I dare her to
1106180	1107680	put the tampon in her nose on the internet.
1107680	1110520	I have a reason to look like shit.
1110520	1111520	Are you putting that on the internet?
1111520	1112520	Why not?
1112520	1113520	Oh, I'm happy.
1113520	1114520	All right.
1114520	1115920	Dark Soccer with a tampon in her nose.
1115920	1120300	Yes, as Mae Satsuma in chat says, it's nosepon.
1120300	1122720	It's going up on the internet right now, orangehontrader.com.
1122720	1125620	Click refresh a million times.
1125620	1129980	I then also thought of you because I was playing the criminologist last night at Rocky and
1129980	1133000	I was going through the bag and there's two wigs in there, one gray and one black.
1133000	1136760	And when I pulled out the black wig, I went, this looks like a Tribble.
1136760	1140260	And I was like, oh, that makes me think of my friend Jamie because she plays Star Trek
1140260	1142080	online and she always tells the story about the Tribbles.
1142080	1146200	Did you know you can get the Tribbles in your inventory and they multiply?
1146200	1150280	They only multiply if you have food because they eat your food.
1150280	1151280	I'm sorry.
1151280	1152280	Yes, that's right.
1152280	1153800	The picture should be up now.
1153800	1159360	If I see this on verydemotivational.com, I will kill you.
1159360	1161520	Don't tell them what website to post it to.
1161520	1163520	At least you're not John McCain.
1163520	1164800	Did you hear about that?
1164800	1165880	What the fuck happened this time?
1165880	1167280	I don't pay attention to that loser.
1167280	1168560	No, this is funny.
1168560	1175300	John McCain posted a picture of himself on the Twit pic or whatever, you know, and I'm
1175300	1176480	not starting a political thing.
1176480	1177640	I just think this is funny.
1177640	1179320	If it had been Obama, it would have been funny too.
1179320	1180880	Was he like playing with his nibbles or something?
1180880	1181880	No, no, no.
1181880	1182880	He was.
1182880	1183880	It was really funny.
1183880	1188280	No, he posted a picture just on his iPhone like, you know, because, you know, John McCain
1188280	1189760	is really old, right?
1189760	1193360	So the joke is he's probably not hip with technology, but he's showing, hey, I can take
1193360	1195420	a picture of myself with my iPhone.
1195420	1201080	So he did that and somebody took the picture and posted it to guyswithiphones.com, which
1201080	1205800	if you've never been to that site, most of you probably don't want to go because it's
1205800	1207640	kind of a gay porn website.
1207640	1212120	Most of the guys that take pictures on that site have their wangs hanging out and, you
1212120	1216160	know, they're balls and that's what the site is, okay?
1216160	1217160	Don't ask me how I know.
1217160	1222480	I read about, I read about it on Priz Hilton, okay, shut up.
1222480	1226760	But somebody posted a picture, that picture of John McCain on that website.
1226760	1231360	So you go to guyswithiphone.com and it's like penis, penis, balls, balls, wang, wang, butt,
1231360	1236360	but John McCain.
1236360	1237360	It was funny.
1237360	1238360	All right.
1238360	1239360	Anyhow.
1239360	1245120	Hey, how about some housekeeping and then maybe we will actually talk about some video
1245120	1246200	games tonight.
1246200	1252000	It's going to be a short show tonight, kids, apologies, but if you can't tell why, I don't
1252000	1255260	know what show you're listening to, but it will be a bit of a short show tonight, meaning
1255260	1258180	it's not part A, part B, it's just one giant part tonight.
1258180	1260440	So we're going to try and wrap up the show by eight o'clock.
1260440	1261440	We will still take your calls.
1261440	1264280	We'll take your Twitter topics, mailbag, all that stuff.
1264280	1265280	We're not going to neglect it.
1265280	1268280	Just a few less stories tonight so we can get out of here.
1268280	1270400	I'm reading one email.
1270400	1271400	There's one email.
1271400	1272400	I'm going to read one.
1272400	1273400	One email.
1273400	1275480	Tiger call on our chat room says, what's next?
1275480	1276760	McCain gets on chat roulette.
1276760	1278160	Oh God.
1278160	1280880	Talk about the cesspool of the internet.
1280880	1281880	Chat roulette.
1281880	1285520	I thought that was 2chan or 4chan.
1285520	1290120	There is no word to describe that, but like chat roulette, there's some really funny YouTube's
1290120	1296520	that come of chat roulette and my favorite is the guy that plays piano improv to the
1296520	1297660	people on chat roulette.
1297660	1298660	You've got to look this up.
1298660	1299660	What's his name?
1299660	1300660	Murk.
1300660	1301660	Murk hot.
1301660	1302660	Murk hot is his name.
1302660	1303660	Something like that.
1303660	1307320	I'm sure somebody in chat will say it, but, um, he goes on chat roulette and just starts
1307320	1309120	playing like random piano songs.
1309120	1314320	Like, Hey bro, in the red shirt, sitting there looking mean, you know, he just, it's funny.
1314320	1315320	Trust me.
1315320	1316320	It's piano improv.
1316320	1317320	It's hilarious.
1317320	1320780	Everybody thought he was Ben Folds, which made Ben Folds actually do it at a concert
1320780	1321780	later on.
1321780	1323280	It was funny.
1323280	1325240	Hey, gaming news.
1325240	1328920	We're a video game podcast.
1328920	1336760	Major Nelson starts off our game thing tonight and somebody hacked, hacked sword major Nelson's
1336760	1338060	game card.
1338060	1339060	You know, major Nelson.
1339060	1340060	He's famous.
1340060	1343000	And you know, if you ever on the three 60 and you download the X-Box minute, hi, I'm
1343000	1344000	major Nelson.
1344000	1346120	I'm at PAX East.
1346120	1349180	You know, that's, and that's exactly what he sounds like to, he always goes out to the
1349180	1353820	different events and he's kind of like, he's, he's the mouth for X-Box three 60, but that's,
1353820	1354820	that's a good thing.
1354820	1358080	Major Nelson is kind of the mouth for the three 60 Reggie fees.
1358080	1362000	Amay is kind of the mouth, even though he's also the CEO, he's kind of the mouth for Nintendo.
1362000	1366600	You kind of associate, you know, your, we press conference with Reggie fees, Amay.
1366600	1370640	And then Sony, I don't know, Sony, Sony doesn't really have a mouth.
1370640	1377560	I mean, I guess there's that one girl who's on the, the, um, um, core, but I can't even
1377560	1378560	think of her name.
1378560	1380900	Like that tells you what a mouthpiece she is.
1380900	1386240	So major Nelson is kind of like the spokesman, if you will, for a three 60, but his, uh,
1386240	1390620	his, uh, gamer card was hacked and it happened around the time packs was going on.
1390620	1393140	So they picked a good time to do it, honestly.
1393140	1399300	But what's weird is that like, I don't understand why you would like hack somebody's thing because
1399300	1405440	they hacked his name to say, I'm a faggot, like ha ha funny.
1405440	1407320	Like you're in the third grade.
1407320	1416040	And then, uh, I don't know, they, they made the, the, the text say any account, $100 PayPal,
1416040	1419940	I guess, meaning that you could pay these people a hundred dollars and they'll hack
1419940	1426760	any account because you know, if they can get major Nelson, they can get your neighbor
1426760	1430600	or your college friend that you're mad at or whatever as well.
1430600	1433580	Well, somebody took a responsibility for it.
1433580	1436960	I'm not even going to say who it was cause they're, they're trash and I'm not going to
1436960	1440000	promote them here on the show, but somebody took responsibility for it and they even did
1440000	1443240	a YouTube video, blah, blah, blah.
1443240	1447680	So obviously Microsoft fix this, but this just begs the question, why, why would you
1447680	1449400	hack someone's gamer card?
1449400	1451200	What is to gain from that?
1451200	1452200	It's EP'ing Rob.
1452200	1453200	Really?
1453200	1456480	I mean, at least like when you hack a wow account, like, you know, in my house.
1456480	1459360	It's a famous target.
1459360	1462880	So it's kind of like when the celebrity Twitters get hacked and like, you know, hi, I hacked
1462880	1466620	Britney Spears, you know, I have a huge vagina and things like, it's funny to tweet as Britney
1466620	1468800	Spears and say sick things.
1468800	1470560	I don't, I still don't understand.
1470560	1472720	Like there's no, I don't know.
1472720	1474520	It just seems odd.
1474520	1475520	Like a gamer card.
1475520	1480680	Why don't you just hack major Nelson.com like then you could get people to go to your trash
1480680	1482840	website like automatically with a four.
1482840	1486100	Not that I'm saying you should do that cause you shouldn't, but I just, I don't understand
1486100	1490580	the purpose of hacking someone's gamer card to say, I'm a faggot nonetheless.
1490580	1494800	You know, like that's just stupid.
1494800	1495800	It is stupid.
1495800	1499120	I know what Rob, what you're doing right now talking about it.
1499120	1500400	That's exactly why they do it.
1500400	1504400	No, I know, which is why I didn't say the name of the site that took responsibility
1504400	1505400	for it.
1505400	1507640	But I just think it's just weird to me.
1507640	1512020	Like I think it does need to be talked about, like why would people hack gamer cards or
1512020	1514120	what's next?
1514120	1517780	This is so watch out.
1517780	1520480	Don't make people too mad because they might send these guys a hundred dollars and your
1520480	1525640	gamer card will be hacked next and everybody will think that, you know, you're a whatever
1525640	1528800	sixth grade word they want to put in there to describe you.
1528800	1529800	So be careful.
1529800	1531680	Maybe they need authenticators on Xbox live.
1531680	1534320	Is that's what's going to come next authenticators?
1534320	1535320	Who knows?
1535320	1536320	Who knows?
1536320	1540640	You know, um, you know, uh, Kristin got hacked on wow.
1540640	1541640	I had read about that.
1541640	1542640	A lot of people are getting hacked on.
1542640	1543640	Wow.
1543640	1544640	It happened.
1544640	1545760	Like if you don't have an authenticator, you are going to get hacked.
1545760	1546880	It's just a matter of time.
1546880	1552040	Like do not think you are immune to this.
1552040	1557400	Like I got hacked on wow and I am not stupid with stuff I downloaded.
1557400	1561880	I don't click banners on things that, you know, aren't legit and all this other stuff.
1561880	1564920	Like I got hacked and I think I know what happened.
1564920	1568140	I think I logged in on my ex's computer and he was stupid.
1568140	1570000	So I think that's what happened.
1570000	1571000	You know what, Rob?
1571000	1572000	What?
1572000	1573000	I can't get hacked.
1573000	1574000	Why?
1574000	1575000	My account's disabled.
1575000	1576000	Well, yeah, you can't get hacked.
1576000	1577000	I ain't paying for that.
1577000	1583000	But actually I've heard of them like re-enabling accounts and going back in.
1583000	1584000	So you gotta be careful.
1584000	1585240	Well, you have an authenticator.
1585240	1586240	You're fine.
1586240	1587240	Yeah.
1587240	1590520	But I think I had a friend who his account was dormant for like six months and they re-enabled
1590520	1597280	it and oh man, they do, they do this dirty, dirty stuff just to get in there and mine
1597280	1600640	millions of ore and sell it to people.
1600640	1601640	Here's the thing.
1601640	1605000	When you buy gold online, you are supporting this.
1605000	1607200	I blame you as much as I blame the hackers.
1607200	1610440	When you buy gold online, you support all these accounts getting hacked.
1610440	1611440	Knock it off.
1611440	1615680	You know, if I remember right in Star Trek Online, we actually do have a report if ever
1615680	1618400	we see anything happening right away.
1618400	1624120	Like it's set up in the mail and set up on the heads up display, which I think is smart.
1624120	1628920	You need to have some, I don't remember Blizzard had anything like that, but I liked what Ion
1628920	1629920	used to do.
1629920	1633280	They used to have these very public executions in on the ion server.
1633280	1635680	They would have like public executions of spammers.
1635680	1636680	It was amazing.
1636680	1638000	I have to watch them.
1638000	1639000	That's what we needed.
1639000	1640000	Wow.
1640000	1641200	We need, this will be the nice thing.
1641200	1644880	OMG spoiler alert coming categories of spoiler, plug your ears if you don't want it.
1644880	1645880	Okay.
1645880	1649440	When gross takes over the hoard, since he's like a nasty little man, he should just start
1649440	1650820	executing the spammers.
1650820	1651820	That's what I want to see.
1651820	1655240	He apparently he's going to be executing everyone else, so he needs to execute the spammers.
1655240	1656240	Okay.
1656240	1657880	And spoiler safe to listen.
1657880	1660960	Well, how about other stuff, Rob?
1660960	1661960	Okay.
1661960	1664760	I have to make, give a shout out to get games.
1664760	1670960	Their ads are really funny and stylistically very good as a designer.
1670960	1671960	I like it.
1671960	1672960	All right.
1672960	1679240	It says in Soviet Russia, games get you two sniffs up, but it looks like old, uh, political
1679240	1680240	posters.
1680240	1681240	Anyway.
1681240	1684560	Um, two K sports.
1684560	1686600	They like a move in Natal.
1686600	1694160	Um, their marketing dude, Jason Argent said, um, that there are, that the sports games
1694160	1701160	are a natural fit for motion control and was mentioning by name, uh, the two K, uh, major
1701160	1702160	league baseball series.
1702160	1707260	They didn't really give anything else up on that, but I think that they're pretty pleased
1707260	1709880	with it and go and keep it going.
1709880	1711880	So good for them.
1711880	1715800	I don't know Rob, what do you think?
1715800	1720360	I think I should be able to get that big orange bat that you recently dug up, apparently according
1720360	1725880	to your Facebook and with Natal, I should be able to use that bat as I play two K games.
1725880	1729280	You'd have to come over here to get it because I won't break anything at all doing that in
1729280	1730280	my house.
1730280	1734040	But the orange bat is awesome.
1734040	1736840	There's signatures on that thing that I ain't seen in ages.
1736840	1741060	Not that I think that they're, they're going to encourage people to use actual bats with
1741060	1742060	these games.
1742060	1744040	Like it'll just be used swinging your hand or something.
1744040	1747600	I don't know, we're having the motion with it like a pretend bat, but that would be really
1747600	1753320	funny is if you try to use a real bat and like that is just not smart for most houses
1753320	1755080	because then the bat goes flying through the TV.
1755080	1759580	I mean, you thought the we emotes were bad, but this seems like a natural progression.
1759580	1766240	I mean, what, what smarter than, you know, if extra, extra gaming or exercise gaming
1766240	1771120	is like the next big thing, what smarter thing to do than to incorporate that with established
1771120	1772120	franchises?
1772120	1775320	You need a light saber.
1775320	1780680	This brings a whole new level to rod caliber, Rob.
1780680	1786200	I think though, I hope that what these games do is make this support optional and I think
1786200	1787200	they will.
1787200	1789560	I think they know that there's still a hardcore audience, especially when you're talking about
1789560	1792920	2k and you know, who knows whatever EA Sports ends up doing.
1792920	1796020	I think they still know there's a very hardcore audience that does not want to stand there
1796020	1800880	and flail their arms everywhere to pretend, you know, what have you.
1800880	1802120	I kind of like what they do.
1802120	1803120	You know, it's weird.
1803120	1805080	We don't talk about sports games a lot on this show, but I kind of like what they do
1805080	1810560	with Madden is that on the Wii, they really make the Wii game kind of targeted as the
1810560	1812480	easy type game, if you will.
1812480	1818160	And then the 360 and the PS3 versions are for the hardcore.
1818160	1819160	Although I don't know.
1819160	1820160	I don't think they should do separate versions.
1820160	1823640	It's just be one version with two different modes, but we'll see what they do.
1823640	1825400	You all right over there.
1825400	1827660	It's like death is on the show tonight.
1827660	1828660	This is amazing.
1828660	1831720	I don't even look like myself, Rob.
1831720	1838520	I can't believe you put that picture on the website.
1838520	1839520	Why not?
1839520	1840520	I don't care anymore.
1840520	1841520	No, it's fine.
1841520	1842520	It's fine.
1842520	1843520	Jamie's in don't give a shit mode.
1843520	1848320	Please go to orangelaundry.com quickly before dark soccer realizes what a, what a, what
1848320	1849320	she did.
1849320	1851760	No, it's really a horrid picture.
1851760	1855520	I don't think I've ever looked that bad in my life.
1855520	1857020	You know what we need?
1857020	1859840	We need like a blingy competition with that picture.
1859840	1864720	A blingy, haven't you ever, well, you don't use MySpace.
1864720	1869840	So blingy is the site that puts the glitter and the hearts and all that.
1869840	1873020	Just MySpace trash all over a picture.
1873020	1877720	So somebody needs to take your picture and blingy-fy it to make it pretty.
1877720	1883360	This is the most horrible picture of you ever.
1883360	1885360	What is wrong with this show tonight?
1885360	1890400	Well, no, I, I came, I came home and I washed my face and I'm like, fuck it.
1890400	1893400	I don't care how it looks tonight.
1893400	1896720	And cause it's just you, it's just little old me.
1896720	1897720	That's Rob.
1897720	1898720	It's just me.
1898720	1899720	I don't care.
1899720	1900800	I love these Vicks and Halor things though.
1900800	1901800	They're perfect.
1901800	1903360	I, I might have to get one.
1903360	1904360	I don't know.
1904360	1905360	We'll see.
1905360	1906560	Although I feel like I'm getting better.
1906560	1908000	It's just last week was bad.
1908000	1911880	I, I, you know, I teach for a living and I couldn't talk Wednesday and Thursday and that's
1911880	1913440	bad for a teacher.
1913440	1915480	Like that's, that's really bad.
1915480	1919440	Toegak, by the way, is, is a blingy-fying your picture right now.
1919440	1920440	I'm excited.
1920440	1926560	Please do not really, or I'll never put another picture of me online again.
1926560	1928840	Toegak, send it to me private message.
1928840	1929840	Okay.
1929840	1931840	Don't, don't post it publicly.
1931840	1933960	All right.
1933960	1937720	Anyhow, at least you're not a dirty thief, right?
1937720	1940680	You can hack all these accounts and stuff, but at least you're not a dirty thief.
1940680	1945440	Well, apparently at PAX East, there was a theft out on the show floor and I'm not talking
1945440	1947260	about like somebody's purse getting stolen.
1947260	1951120	Apparently Atomic Games had this game that they were showing breach.
1951120	1955960	The code was actually stolen from the show floor.
1955960	1957880	Now this whole thing ended up being stopped.
1957880	1962360	Like, you know, the guy, I guess had a little USB dongle thing.
1962360	1964540	He was trying to copy the code.
1964540	1965720	Somebody spotted him.
1965720	1970080	He ran out into the large crowd, but they caught him somehow and they found the code
1970080	1971560	on his computer.
1971560	1976020	And the suspect apparently did admit that he was stealing the code.
1976020	1978840	So he's like, yeah, I'm stealing the code.
1978840	1982000	And when he got caught, he said, no big deal.
1982000	1987040	I really liked the game and I wanted to play it with my friends because that makes it okay.
1987040	1991160	He stole about 14 megs of the code before somebody caught him.
1991160	1994440	That's so messed up.
1994440	1998000	By the way, the alleged thief, Justin D. May.
1998000	2002360	Wilmington, Delaware is where he lives apparently and he's got a lovely little picture all over
2002360	2003360	the internet now.
2003360	2008000	His little mug shot hit all the gaming blogs.
2008000	2011200	Let's see, he said, I got online using the ethernet cable hanging outside their booth
2011200	2012660	because wifi wasn't working.
2012660	2015800	They stopped me, checked my computer and saw the Xbox neighborhood application.
2015800	2019040	Because that was on there, they accused me of stealing breach even though it's not on
2019040	2020040	my computer.
2020040	2025200	So that's what he's saying in his defense.
2025200	2029400	Apparently though, the atomic staff is counter responding to this saying, he said several
2029400	2033360	times he knew people and could give us bigger and more important people and he could name
2033360	2034360	names.
2034360	2037520	However, I have no idea if these people are on the show floor or just hackers at home.
2037520	2040720	I would hate to think he got someone's full code and their title is going to be compromised
2040720	2041720	due to this guy.
2041720	2042720	I just need to make it clear.
2042720	2044960	He didn't say anything specific.
2044960	2049400	Boy, oh boy.
2049400	2054320	Apparently this guy, oh my God, this guy apparently even spoke up at a panel earlier in the day
2054320	2060280	about Xbox live enforcement and the thief wanted to get his gamer tag un-banned.
2060280	2065240	Steven Toluus, I probably mispronounced that wrong, Toluus, I'm distracted by Jamie's nose
2065240	2066240	blowing.
2066240	2070480	Steven Toluus, the director of policy and enforcement for Xbox live actually asked the
2070480	2076280	guy what he did and the hacker said he played Forza 3 before release and he said, well you
2076280	2078840	shouldn't have done that.
2078840	2082880	Now if you buy games early from a retailer that breaks street date, that doesn't get
2082880	2086160	players banned, but illegal pre-release play does.
2086160	2089640	Good gosh, what a mess.
2089640	2094520	This is J100 Matt in our chatroom says, how stupid does this kid have to be to steal a
2094520	2096760	game that had an ex-Marina at the booth?
2096760	2100720	Don't steal shit, especially when there are 60,000 witnesses around.
2100720	2104440	Don't steal shit to begin with, but really don't steal shit when there's like that many
2104440	2106320	people around.
2106320	2108600	Sometimes the best thefts happen in plain sight.
2108600	2110240	This is dumb.
2110240	2113200	You're a dummy.
2113200	2114880	Well how about something else that's dumb?
2114880	2118720	Although I kind of get it, but I still think it's a little on the stupid side.
2118720	2128600	The 3.21 firmware update for PS3 removes the option to install other OS.
2128600	2131520	So no more Linux.
2131520	2136300	They're getting rid of that because of security concerns, they said.
2136300	2139320	So they're just going to start taking features away from our PlayStation.
2139320	2142540	They're just like, nope, you know what, you shouldn't have this feature anymore.
2142540	2144480	You know what?
2144480	2146380	Not smart of Sony to do.
2146380	2147380	You know why?
2147380	2152080	Because Sony is getting cocky with all this hacking scene thing.
2152080	2154380	And I just point to the PSP.
2154380	2158860	Every time Sony releases some patch, they say, it's unhackable, unwinnable, the hackers
2158860	2162680	will never succeed, they will never hack the PSP, it is unhackable.
2162680	2164720	Two days later, it's hacked.
2164720	2168560	Well, I just want to say, if people want something badly enough, they'll find a way to make it
2168560	2169920	happen.
2169920	2173720	And so sure enough, they're going to shut off this because apparently there's some exploit
2173720	2178400	now in the PS3 Linux, I'm surprised it took that long, but now they are taking it away
2178400	2183000	from, one bad apple ruins the barrel, they're taking it away from everybody and saying,
2183000	2186520	well this exploit is just undoable now.
2186520	2188120	We took away Linux.
2188120	2190480	So now you can't do this at all.
2190480	2197660	Well, there is a hacker named George Hotz, who was an iPhone hacker, who apparently did
2197660	2201040	crack the code on the PS3.
2201040	2206140	And then that's what might have started this whole thing.
2206140	2211460	But the point is, is that if people want the hack bad enough, there will be something that
2211460	2214960	will reverse engineer the PS3 back to the old patch.
2214960	2218160	I mean, they do it all the time with the PSP.
2218160	2219160	I don't know.
2219160	2223540	I think though, for the majority of people, for the common person, hardly anyone's going
2223540	2224540	to notice this happen.
2224540	2229240	I mean, come on, listeners, how many of you were really using this feature?
2229240	2231840	And maybe there's going to be a couple of you that are like, me, me, me, me.
2231840	2236800	Well, if that's you, then you're probably continuing to use your PS3 for its Linux features,
2236800	2240480	and therefore you're not going to want to take your PS3 on PlayStation Network and get
2240480	2241960	the update.
2241960	2244060	Because that's the only way you're going to be forced to update is when you try to play
2244060	2250120	a game online or if you try to buy a new game, you know, that eventually, you know, the firmware
2250120	2254560	will be on the disks for that later game, Uncharted 3 or whatever game comes later that
2254560	2256600	everybody has to have.
2256600	2261400	Well, apparently, what, it's pretty, pretty big.
2261400	2268160	I might just put this in the chat room, because the way this guy has done it, I actually could
2268160	2269720	see why Sony would make some changes.
2269720	2273360	Well, I'm sure, it's just a matter of time before he finds another, he'll find an exploit
2273360	2277200	in a game or something to reverse the firmware back to something old that's on the PSP all
2277200	2278460	the time.
2278460	2281400	I'm sure if Loki were here, he'd say he'd already done it.
2281400	2287880	I'm like, it's just, it's just, it's too bad that Sony felt the need to patch it out for
2287880	2291840	everyone because this was found when this isn't going to stop it.
2291840	2292840	That's my point.
2292840	2295700	This is not going to stop the hacking.
2295700	2298640	You know, it's going to make it more difficult, yeah, but it's not going to stop it.
2298640	2301020	Those that really want to do it are still going to do it.
2301020	2304040	So it's just kind of a bummer to those that were using Linux legitimately, but at the
2304040	2307920	same time, I just can't think of a whole lots of reasons.
2307920	2312440	I mean, yeah, the computer in there was kind of unique, but I think if you're, you harnessed
2312440	2316000	its power for whatever, you're not really playing games with it and therefore you won't
2316000	2317000	be affected anyway.
2317000	2321360	There's just going to be such a minority of users affected by this, but it still sucks
2321360	2322360	for them.
2322360	2325200	You should send those angry cards and letters to Sony.
2325200	2328600	What I love about the patch that they did, didn't add a damn thing.
2328600	2329640	It didn't add anything.
2329640	2332600	There was no silver lining to this patch.
2332600	2337640	It's just, yep, we're just taking this feature away later.
2337640	2341560	ToaGak says, actually, they're having issues downgrading the PSP from recent firmware as
2341560	2342560	well.
2342560	2343560	It got, it's getting harder.
2343560	2346520	It's not going to stop them.
2346520	2348520	Won't stop them.
2348520	2354560	Anyhow, moving on to other news regarding the Xbox and talking about game room.
2354560	2357840	Uh, you know, I've been playing game room a little bit here and there.
2357840	2359440	I like it overall.
2359440	2363200	I think, um, they probably should have waited about three more months to release it for
2363200	2366280	them to work out some of the bugs, but you know, whatever.
2366280	2367760	It's it's okay.
2367760	2369800	Um, it's, it's showing promise.
2369800	2370800	Let's put it that way.
2370800	2372200	It's showing promise.
2372200	2377680	Um, well, game room, uh, launched and they have 30 games in the lineup right now.
2377680	2382360	Um, however, you know, you might've heard when that they wanted to have a thousand games
2382360	2384400	on the service at some point.
2384400	2386720	And in order to do that, they're going to have to have weekly releases.
2386720	2392000	Well, it came out this week that you're not going to see weekly releases until late April.
2392000	2395800	So that would mean like, you know, the last week of April, basically.
2395800	2401160	So, if you were hoping for more games, nope, not going to happen right away.
2401160	2405080	You know, I'm looking forward to like Pitfall and Kaboom and some of the other, uh, Activision
2405080	2408080	classics and who knows what other little arcade gems they might dig up.
2408080	2409080	Burger time, anyone?
2409080	2413000	Uh, but we're not going to start seeing those till late April.
2413000	2417920	Um, interesting tidbit by the way, cause I don't think this came up on our show.
2417920	2422800	I think I mentioned it on Bobby's show on the call, but I actually, um, was with a pal
2422800	2428140	Segg, my friend Segg was playing game room on the show floor at Microsoft's booth.
2428140	2431920	And what's really funny is that he actually got the blue screen of death on the game.
2431920	2435320	And honestly it seemed like he, all he did was set the controller down on top of the
2435320	2438520	computer and it just threw the whole damn thing off balance and it blew screen to death
2438520	2440960	right in front of everybody.
2440960	2444040	So we were playing game room on the show floor and before he managed to crash the thing,
2444040	2447660	um, I asked the guy, I said, so they're going to be doing like weekly releases with this.
2447660	2450920	I heard something like a thousand games, you know, keep in mind, I don't have a media badge
2450920	2451920	on.
2451920	2452920	I don't use media.
2452920	2453920	So I'm just, you know, the everyday gamer.
2453920	2462080	And the guy said to me, he said, well, well, I don't know if weekly releases is what they're
2462080	2466320	going to end up doing, but they want to look at doing regular releases, but I don't know
2466320	2467820	if it'll be weekly.
2467820	2470040	So they're already starting to backtrack a little bit.
2470040	2472760	Releases that eat their fiber.
2472760	2474000	It will not be regular.
2474000	2479120	No, it will be just sporadic and all over the place.
2479120	2482040	Like a McDonald's inspired release.
2482040	2485840	Well, how about other stuff?
2485840	2486840	Yes.
2486840	2487840	How about Miyamoto?
2487840	2489360	I think being a little foolish.
2489360	2497960	Um, it basically thinks that Nintendo has a responsibility to educate the larger audiences
2497960	2504120	about the benefits of gaming that he thinks that most people are afraid of gaming technology
2504120	2509040	that, you know, once they become accustomed to it, there's nothing to be afraid of.
2509040	2510760	Not afraid at all.
2510760	2512640	How about just people don't like games?
2512640	2516520	Some of them just don't like video games.
2516520	2517920	I think there's a little truth to that.
2517920	2520720	I mean, like my parents don't like video games.
2520720	2522840	Well, I don't know.
2522840	2525680	My dad doesn't care, but he doesn't really play them.
2525680	2528520	I think there are a lot of people that don't get games.
2528520	2535080	I mean, going back to PAX a little bit, part of the whole, you know, people were very moved
2535080	2538880	by Wil Wheaton's opening speech and all this stuff, which I get because it was a very rah
2538880	2539960	rah rah.
2539960	2541060	This is our culture.
2541060	2542060	This is our time.
2542060	2543200	This is your place.
2543200	2544520	Nobody's going to judge you here.
2544520	2546560	You can be a gamer here and nobody's going to care.
2546560	2547560	Okay.
2547560	2553960	Well, that says to me that even we as gamers recognize that not everybody gets gaming.
2553960	2554960	You know what I mean?
2554960	2555960	And yeah, don't get me wrong.
2555960	2556960	I think it's ridiculous.
2556960	2560460	I mean, games are no different than movies in my opinion.
2560460	2565020	I mean, you know, interactive entertainment, it's interactive entertainment.
2565020	2568740	There's you know, Nookie is interactive entertainment.
2568740	2570520	So it just depends on what you like.
2570520	2573920	I mean, I don't get people that hate on games, but I think we recognize there are people
2573920	2575760	that just don't get it for whatever reason.
2575760	2578600	Well, I don't, there's a lot of stuff I don't get.
2578600	2580440	Like the hills.
2580440	2583580	I heard the hills got canceled finally.
2583580	2585680	It took like five years for this to happen.
2585680	2588400	I don't get the hills like Heidi and Spencer.
2588400	2589400	Why are they famous?
2589400	2590400	Why?
2590400	2591680	I don't get that.
2591680	2597480	And some people don't get why Final Fantasy 13 is awesome.
2597480	2599760	But there are people out there that just aren't going to get games.
2599760	2603840	I mean, wasn't that Nintendo's whole little thing was that they were going to try and
2603840	2608120	make games more accessible to everybody and they somewhat, I don't know.
2608120	2609560	I think they somewhat succeeded.
2609560	2615760	I mean, they sold tons of consoles and people are all about, you know, Wii Fit and Wii Sports
2615760	2620160	and all these games that have seemed to cross over into the mainstream, you know.
2620160	2623120	Now there is a quote from him I want to read.
2623120	2625520	It has to do with Sony and Microsoft.
2625520	2630440	We feel it's an honor that some form of entertainment style we created is now going to be taken
2630440	2637040	for granted thanks to the attitude taken by other companies, meaning their adoption of
2637040	2638040	motion control.
2638040	2639040	Aha.
2639040	2642360	So it's the kind of thing where it's like, well, everybody else seems to agree.
2642360	2645840	Imitation is the best form of, yeah.
2645840	2648880	Plus, you know, you're forgetting.
2648880	2655300	Microsoft does an incredibly good job of stealing people's ideas and making them better.
2655300	2657800	And I think that's what they're trying to do with this whole Natal thing.
2657800	2659400	They're going to make it better.
2659400	2660400	But we'll see.
2660400	2661640	I mean, that's still debatable.
2661640	2667120	You can't really argue that until the system or game or whatever you want to call it itself
2667120	2668120	comes out.
2668120	2669120	But we'll see.
2669120	2672520	PlayStation Move, you know, some of the early feedback was pretty good that it's way more
2672520	2674000	responsive than the Wii.
2674000	2677800	That's just competition, my friends, competition.
2677800	2681120	All these companies trying to one-up each other.
2681120	2684740	Speaking of which, there are a lot of companies out there that are currently trying to get
2684740	2688600	your dollar as far as selling their video games.
2688600	2692000	And we'll start with Japan this week for the release dates.
2692000	2693320	Some of the release dates.
2693320	2697240	Not a lot of new games on the 360 in Japan this week, but a crap ton of price reductions.
2697240	2702400	Death Smiles, Far Cry 2, Mass Effect, Ninja Blade, Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, Hawk,
2702400	2707060	all getting price reductions this week.
2707060	2711360	Moving on to the PlayStation 3, also just price reductions.
2711360	2712360	No new games.
2712360	2716160	Dead Blades and Tom Clancy's HAWK or Hux.
2716160	2718120	Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.
2718120	2720340	It's really kind of a dry week.
2720340	2724440	PlayStation 2, Clover no Kuni no Alice is like the only new game I'm seeing there on
2724440	2725960	the PlayStation 2.
2725960	2731480	On the Nintendo DS, again, nothing really new this week.
2731480	2732480	It's a slow week.
2732480	2733480	I don't know.
2733480	2735440	You'd think like there's a Dragon Warrior game or something coming out where everything's
2735440	2736840	getting out of the way.
2736840	2739920	On the PSP, Monochrome is coming out this week.
2739920	2742360	I believe that's the sequel to EchoChrome.
2742360	2748600	And then there is one other game coming out, Judae no Atelier, Grimnant no Rekonjutsu,
2748600	2758580	Torawear no Morito from Gust, which is, well, it looks like there's this like, let's see.
2758580	2763080	It's like a time traveling game and cute little slime looking characters and little teddy
2763080	2766360	bears and cute stuff and chicks with enormous breasts.
2766360	2769760	So you're very like anime infused game.
2769760	2774320	It's a PSP remake apparently of an older game.
2774320	2775320	So there you go.
2775320	2778600	Well, I've got a couple of UK releases if you're ready.
2778600	2785520	Just two, Blue Toad Murder Files Episodes 4, 5, and 6, and Lead and Gold Gangs of the
2785520	2787160	Wild West.
2787160	2788160	That's it.
2788160	2791920	This used to be a slow week all over the world.
2791920	2792920	I wonder what that is.
2792920	2795920	Maybe just because it's not, you know, a very busy time of year, although isn't it like
2795920	2796920	spring break?
2796920	2797920	Well, I guess this last week was spring break.
2797920	2798920	Yeah, last week was spring break.
2798920	2799920	I don't know.
2799920	2802960	It's a slow week in the US as well, which you have to look forward to this week in the
2802960	2803960	US.
2803960	2809760	Commandos complete on the PC, a Borderlands add-on pack coming to the 360 and the PC,
2809760	2812080	a game called Again on the DS.
2812080	2814300	It's an action game from Koi Entertainment.
2814300	2818120	And then my personal favorite here of the week that's coming out, Squishy Tank on the
2818120	2819120	Nintendo DS.
2819120	2820880	And I love the cover.
2820880	2822500	Of course, it's from Natsume.
2822500	2823760	I love the cover art.
2823760	2825320	It's like a puzzle game.
2825320	2829320	And if you look at the cover art, it looks like, like, imagine a slime from the Dragon
2829320	2831760	Quest series and somebody is poking it.
2831760	2836740	And so it has the angry face because it's being poked, yet it is a tank.
2836740	2840160	So there it is.
2840160	2842520	Squishy Tank for 20 bucks.
2842520	2843520	Squishy.
2843520	2844840	It's a puzzle game.
2844840	2848960	Looks like match up colored blocks and make tanks squishy.
2848960	2849960	It's squishy.
2849960	2850960	Squishy.
2850960	2853960	Oh, we're ready to get into, I guess, the mailbag.
2853960	2856920	We're at that part of the show where we're going to dive into the mailbag and read some
2856920	2857920	of your emails here.
2857920	2859160	I'm reading three.
2859160	2861640	And Dark Soccer will try her best to not sniff through them all.
2861640	2865040	Thank you everyone for keeping them short.
2865040	2867120	By the way, if you want to send us emails, please do.
2867120	2868820	Next week hopefully we'll be better.
2868820	2872720	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place you send emails and Dark Soccer reads them
2872720	2875480	like she's going to do right now while I munch on this tortilla.
2875480	2876480	Hey, O.L.R.
2876480	2879760	Oh, do you haven't eaten yet?
2879760	2880760	I've been talking.
2880760	2881760	I can't eat and talk.
2881760	2882760	We'll fucking eat already.
2882760	2883760	All right, you talk.
2883760	2884760	We'll eat.
2884760	2885760	Let me know how it is.
2885760	2886760	Read some emails.
2886760	2887760	Hey, O.L.R.
2887760	2890160	I was listening to your podcast at work and noticed Rob wonder why Final Fight and Magic
2890160	2892040	Sword are getting packaged together.
2892040	2896800	The reason is simply that the developers of the company who are doing the port love Magic
2896800	2897800	Sword.
2897800	2902120	The only way they would have been able to get it released is to bundle it with another
2902120	2903120	game.
2903120	2907440	So can you, so you can think they're completely selfish acts as the reason you're getting
2907440	2908440	Magic Sword.
2908440	2909440	P. A.Z.H.P.
2909440	2910440	P.S.
2910440	2914920	When Rob asked Loki to be a lady.
2914920	2919160	For some reason I had an image of Rob singing Loki be a lady to the tune of Luck be a Lady
2919160	2920160	by Frank Sinatra.
2920160	2921160	I did that.
2921160	2925240	Loki be a lady tonight, Loki if you've been a lady to begin with, Loki be a lady.
2925240	2926440	I really did that on the show.
2926440	2928240	I told Loki to be a lady.
2928240	2932040	Apparently I was drunk.
2932040	2933040	Wink wink nudge nudge.
2933040	2934800	Thanks for the email.
2934800	2937920	There should be more random tangents and acts of love.
2937920	2940240	I know there's guardian legend fans out there.
2940240	2943120	Help me out.
2943120	2944120	But thank you.
2944120	2946960	I'm so excited about Magic Sword I could piddle.
2946960	2948960	Okay.
2948960	2951560	Next one.
2951560	2953560	Good evening Orange Nails Radio and fellow listeners.
2953560	2955880	This is Gditz writing in again.
2955880	2960560	Seeing as it's my birthday today then that I am in the process of getting ready for a
2960560	2964920	night out I realize I won't be able to attend the live show today which I regret as it is
2964920	2967540	always something fun and enlightening.
2967540	2973180	So I figured I'd write an email instead so that you guys, while I'm drinking myself into
2973180	2977480	a coma, you guys and gal will have something to discuss about video games.
2977480	2981640	Oh, cause, sorry Mendoza's stuffing up again.
2981640	2985920	I remember myself when I was under the age of 18 and had no problem purchasing one of
2985920	2991920	the worst slash best murder simulators of all time, Grand Theft Auto 3.
2991920	2996120	I am not really shocked that I managed to pull it off but I am a bit dismayed that the
2996120	2997520	retailers don't seem to care.
2997520	3002120	So the question is, do you think it's too easy for children to acquire mature rated
3002120	3005720	games or are the measures taken by retailers good enough?
3005720	3010560	Sorry for any and all spelling errors and or grammatical mistakes and have a happy Easter
3010560	3011560	everyone.
3011560	3015180	Gditz the other Swede.
3015180	3018560	Like I said before about hacking, if somebody wants something bad enough they'll find a
3018560	3020560	way to make it happen.
3020560	3022600	You know, there's always going to be loopholes.
3022600	3029000	I just think that, yeah, there, there should be a degree of responsibility by, by, uh,
3029000	3031080	by the stores to adhere to the rule.
3031080	3036800	But ultimately if the kid gets the game that's on the parent, not on the store.
3036800	3038360	I pretty much agree with Dark Soccer.
3038360	3041600	I like totally like, you know, stores do the best they can.
3041600	3047860	I think if stores are shown to not be following the rules, then actions should be taken accordingly.
3047860	3051000	You know, they do the same thing with cigarettes and alcohol and all this stuff.
3051000	3053160	But ultimately it's up to the parents.
3053160	3057620	I mean, you don't know if somebody, somebody might have like an older brother who will
3057620	3061400	go in and buy the game for them or, you know, like a friend who's older, a cousin, I don't
3061400	3062400	know.
3062400	3063400	That's kind of like the hookup.
3063400	3066240	You know, there's nothing the stores can do about that.
3066240	3070120	And if a kid wants an M rated game bad enough and finds that hookup, then they're going
3070120	3071120	to do it.
3071120	3074240	Unless the parents say, if I catch you playing that game, I'm going to fucking throw your
3074240	3076280	Xbox in the trash.
3076280	3080240	And that's something my parents would have said, you know, like that's what it's ultimately
3080240	3081240	comes down to.
3081240	3083680	I think my mom would have said, when'd you get this?
3083680	3089360	No, my parents, my parents, I don't know, like, I don't know, mature rated games weren't
3089360	3092640	such a problem back then because it was all like the 8-bit NES and the Super Nintendo.
3092640	3096320	So my parents were kind of like, whatever, like they didn't really care about Mortal
3096320	3097320	Combat and stuff.
3097320	3098320	They thought it was stupid.
3098320	3101540	Or my parents, I don't think they ever really watched me play in that stuff.
3101540	3106280	And I think if they did, my mom would walk in and go, Rob, that is gross.
3106280	3107400	What is that game that you're playing?
3107400	3108400	That is gross.
3108400	3109400	Rob.
3109400	3114280	He just knocked the head off, Rob, what are you playing?
3114280	3115280	That is gross.
3115280	3120720	And that would be the extent of it, but I would have been 15 or 16 at the time.
3120720	3123520	So it's like, you know, now I think I even use this as an excuse.
3123520	3128120	It's no grosser than, you know, the movies that my mom watches, you know, Mortal Combat
3128120	3130120	fatalities are funny.
3130120	3138020	Um, last one, and he put a lot of information on here, but I'm not going to say it until
3138020	3144440	I have this expressed permission to, Hey, OLR, just wanted to give you a quick update
3144440	3146880	on the whole fiasco going on with game crazy.
3146880	3152480	This is the guy who's the manager in Colorado, my store, along with four others in the Denver
3152480	3157180	slash Pueblo area, the only two stores in Colorado remain, is now starting liquidation
3157180	3158180	this Friday.
3158180	3164120	Jamie, I really hope that Dan is still safe and if not, I guess we are all in this together.
3164120	3169720	Wish me luck with everything that will be coming my and or our way.
3169720	3174600	And to think I almost bought a 3DHG TV at Best Buy yesterday, but my little guardian
3174600	3175840	angel was telling me not to.
3175840	3176840	Now I know why.
3176840	3177840	Frowny face.
3177840	3181540	Please let me know what is going on in your neck of the woods.
3181540	3182540	One good thing to pass on.
3182540	3185640	A lot of my customers are now listening to your show and love it, so keep it up.
3185640	3187120	Take care, dude.
3187120	3192480	Well then I apologize to your customer base for tonight's show, but, um, I'm sorry to
3192480	3193480	hear it, dude.
3193480	3194480	Cool.
3194480	3197040	Um, I, I, I hope it works out for the best.
3197040	3198920	I mean, I hope you're able to find something somewhere else.
3198920	3200720	I mean, those customers are going to have to go somewhere.
3200720	3205960	So this is also dated from March 22nd, so we might've heard already.
3205960	3206960	Dan dodged the bullet.
3206960	3207960	Wow.
3207960	3208960	Good for him.
3208960	3212520	They closed down a bunch of other stores, but Dan's store was still a pretty well performing
3212520	3213520	store.
3213520	3215840	So he's like, we didn't get any inventory.
3215840	3220240	We were running out and we were sad and we thought we were going to go and then we got
3220240	3222120	a shipment.
3222120	3226080	And then they said, yeah, so Dan's store is still around for a little bit.
3226080	3227720	Dan is also awesome.
3227720	3232640	And there's a thought that his might be one of the ones to survive chapter 11 if the company
3232640	3233640	survives.
3233640	3238880	He just said he was a little disappointed because he hates driving to Cameron Park.
3238880	3240720	Oh yeah, it's far.
3240720	3242400	I've never been there.
3242400	3245440	It's it's it's snows and shit there, doesn't it?
3245440	3246440	It's kind of far.
3246440	3252080	So, um, manager dude, which I'm calling you until you say I can actually say it's you,
3252080	3256640	I mean, you put a store number and everything, but I don't want to jump the gun.
3256640	3257640	Yeah.
3257640	3258640	Yeah.
3258640	3262560	Um, I, I see right about the liquidation.
3262560	3269880	Take your, I deployed it and I hope, oh my God, the show is so sorry.
3269880	3273880	And I hope that that something works out well for you and thank you for, by the way, spreading
3273880	3276760	us around like a disease.
3276760	3277760	Like Rob.
3277760	3278760	Appreciate it.
3278760	3279760	Robin.
3279760	3280760	You know what?
3280760	3284640	Uh, it was the not on me.
3284640	3294680	I suppose it was a, uh, Fana, may 2000 I think my first Fana, may when I did my Emmy cosplay.
3294680	3300620	Apparently all, all the Bay area DDR players and everything were getting sick from an illness
3300620	3305880	that was in theory started by a certain moderator at the time on DDR.
3305880	3306880	Nice.
3306880	3309520	So, and I thought, oh, I'm not going to get it.
3309520	3310520	It's all over.
3310520	3311520	I'm just gone.
3311520	3314160	I came back home sick with double yikes.
3314160	3317400	Sorry to hear it con con crap.
3317400	3324840	Um, but no, and I did get your email on my personal email address and I've just been
3324840	3325840	swamped.
3325840	3330200	So by the way, I have heard that there are game stores out there and like little, um,
3330200	3333640	computer places, little, but you know, like land centers and stuff that actually play
3333640	3336120	this show at the center.
3336120	3337120	And I think that's rad.
3337120	3338480	Like, thank you guys so much.
3338480	3341960	Like we really ought to tone down the swearing so that it would be okay for more places to
3341960	3342960	play us.
3342960	3343960	I said crap.
3343960	3344960	I didn't say shit.
3344960	3349360	Well, but we, oops, I bet we're a heck of a lot more interesting than those stupid tapes.
3349360	3353120	They probably send them to play with all the like, you know, hi, I'm Jeff Keighley and
3353120	3355760	let's see what games coming out next.
3355760	3360200	You know, like that stuff probably gets really old to see on loop over and over again.
3360200	3365080	I think, you know, podcasts are kind of fun, so we'll have to think about cleaning it up
3365080	3366080	some day.
3366080	3367080	We're verbal kitsch, Rob.
3367080	3373800	We're verbal kitsch, but, um, but back to the subject at hand, dude, I feel really rotten
3373800	3374800	for you.
3374800	3381160	And, um, shoot, shoot me another email to my real email and I will respond to you.
3381160	3387760	And I, if I'm just so sorry that you, that this crap is happening and I mean, a lot of
3387760	3392820	it is their own fault for their marketing strategy, but I think that GameStop really
3392820	3395000	started dominating the market.
3395000	3399280	You might just want to send with your email though, some E-Perell as a salacious pop and
3399280	3403120	chat says this episode needs to come with some Perell.
3403120	3407560	Jamie's about to go flush her head in the toilet to get it to stop hurting.
3407560	3411620	By the way, backing up to some earlier messages in chat room from when I was impersonating
3411620	3415320	my mother, um, Amae Satsuma says Skye's parents were from Sesame Street.
3415320	3420100	Yeah, apparently, uh, Tiger Claw said, uh, Rob was probably like, Hey mom, watch this.
3420100	3422480	He does a fatality in the game and she just goes ballistic.
3422480	3424240	Yeah, that's not too far from the truth.
3424240	3428880	I would do stuff just to, just to, uh, ruffle her feathers like, Hey, look at this.
3428880	3432640	Oh Rob, that is gross.
3432640	3433640	Why do you do that?
3433640	3435840	You suddenly reminded me of, go do your homework.
3435840	3439120	You still, it's only reminded me of something that Becky's two year old did.
3439120	3440120	What's that?
3440120	3447560	He went up to, Julian went up to Becky and picked his nose and said, yummy.
3447560	3450400	With the big grim on his face.
3450400	3454200	Just I guess he actually, he, this two year old has mastered smart.
3454200	3466080	Rob, he's a smart kid, but is like, and then he shook his head and goes, yucky, uh, SSJ
3466080	3470080	100 Matt says, no, don't tone down the language there, but he's getting freaked out that we're
3470080	3471080	suddenly going to go G rated.
3471080	3472640	No, we're not going to tone down the language.
3472640	3477000	It would be nice if I had the time or one of us had the time or somebody had the time
3477000	3481160	that we could go through the episode and beep out obscenities and that way you could have
3481160	3484960	like a G rated version, you know, safe for broadcast, but let's face it, we're all too
3484960	3485960	lazy.
3485960	3487840	It's not going to happen.
3487840	3489520	I mean, Loki's on this program.
3489520	3492000	I mean, there's just, it's not going to happen.
3492000	3493520	Not going to happen.
3493520	3497400	Hey, uh, by the way, if you want to send in some emails, you should do so mailbag at orange
3497400	3500480	launch radio.com is the place to send them.
3500480	3505360	Now's the part of the show where we show a little angst and anger and say, F you man,
3505360	3522600	F you.
3522600	3524200	I guess I'll start the F us tonight.
3524200	3525200	Oh, do your back.
3525200	3526200	Oh, hi.
3526200	3527200	Dark Sakura stars off tonight.
3527200	3528200	Thank you.
3528200	3538480	Um, a few to my allergies and the Sacramento area for being rife with plant life.
3538480	3543400	I hope it all burns except for me and my stuff and yours.
3543400	3545700	I need to see your new house.
3545700	3546700	It's quaint.
3546700	3548120	Come over next.
3548120	3550640	Oh no, you have other stuff next weekend.
3550640	3551640	Come over soon.
3551640	3552640	Let's have breakfast.
3552640	3553640	It's fun.
3553640	3554640	On Sunday.
3554640	3555640	All right, we'll see.
3555640	3560840	Um, F you to Paxi's plague by the only one that has it.
3560840	3568400	I think I am F you Paxi's plague, but I would like to say non F you to these lovely triple
3568400	3572720	chocolate M and M's the dark soccer just gave me the air purple and sparkly.
3572720	3573720	I'm going to take pictures of them.
3573720	3575880	It's the gayest food I think I've ever seen.
3575880	3576880	Dude.
3576880	3577880	That's what I said in the kitchen.
3577880	3582880	Rob, I'm going to bring you some of the gayest food I've ever eaten.
3582880	3589920	He's a very gay, uh, as a show 100 Matt in the chat, this is a good question and sure
3589920	3593120	we'll let chatters derail the flow of the show tonight cause I don't care tonight.
3593120	3597240	I mean this show is already fucked up as it is as a show 100 Matt says, serious question
3597240	3598340	for you.
3598340	3603880	What did your parents think of you guys playing DDR dance, dance revolution, the game that
3603880	3605800	brought this show together, dark soccer.
3605800	3606800	What did your parents think?
3606800	3609800	I mean, well you would already, you weren't really living with your parents at that time.
3609800	3614360	I was trying to explain it to my mom and she's like, what?
3614360	3615840	That was pretty much it with my parents too.
3615840	3619680	I mean, I obviously I'd moved out of the house by then I was living on my own.
3619680	3622920	Um, I would've been like, God, what year did we all start playing DDR?
3622920	3624820	I was two, it was 2000 for me.
3624820	3625820	So I'd have been 21.
3625820	3628400	You were just a young and 10 years ago I'd have been 21.
3628400	3631400	So um, I was already out of the house by then.
3631400	3635280	So my parents didn't really know, but they found out later on because when we started
3635280	3639440	doing the tournaments and stuff, like remember we ended up on the news sometimes and then
3639440	3642080	like, you know, our show ended up on the news and some of that stuff.
3642080	3646640	And so my parents were kind of like, okay, well like I don't, I think they just don't
3646640	3647640	get it.
3647640	3649340	I think my mom just kind of giggles.
3649340	3652780	Like I think she kind of points and laughs at me, but doesn't like outright do that cause
3652780	3653780	I'm her kid.
3653780	3654780	There's people who do that.
3654780	3659440	You play that arrow game and my favorite thing is, so if you stomp that makes the arrows
3659440	3660440	move.
3660440	3661560	You know what?
3661560	3662560	You know what?
3662560	3666080	I'm just in that kind of mood tonight where I don't really care.
3666080	3667080	Do it.
3667080	3670040	Let's, um, let's give somebody a call.
3670040	3671040	Let's find out.
3671040	3673480	Cause I just, I need to know.
3673480	3674480	Hold on.
3674480	3677200	Let's, uh, I just have to know the answer to this question.
3677200	3678200	This is a very good question.
3678200	3682200	That's just you and her Matt's posing.
3682200	3684200	Hello?
3684200	3686840	Hi mom.
3686840	3687840	It's Rob.
3687840	3688840	Where are you?
3688840	3691400	I'm on, oh, she hung up on me.
3691400	3693200	My mother just hung up on me.
3693200	3697360	Maybe she doesn't want to be on the radio.
3697360	3698360	Let's try this again.
3698360	3706080	Live radio, boys and girls.
3706080	3707080	Is it working?
3707080	3708080	Stupid Skype.
3708080	3715580	Let's try this one more time and I'm going to give up.
3715580	3720520	We do tape live every Sunday night at all games radio www.allgames.com right after the
3720520	3724780	Bobby Black Wolf show, six o'clock Pacific.
3724780	3725780	Thank you.
3725780	3727800	Uh, all games radio for letting us steal your bandwidth.
3727800	3730200	Hey, Scott has a new show starting ApoDay TV.
3730200	3731200	Check that out.
3731200	3732200	We can call mine.
3732200	3733200	Hello?
3733200	3734200	Hi, it's Rob.
3734200	3735200	Are you there?
3735200	3736200	I'm here.
3736200	3737200	You keep hanging up on me.
3737200	3738200	No, I didn't hang up on you.
3738200	3739200	It's the internet.
3739200	3740520	I'm on, we're on the radio.
3740520	3741520	Is that okay?
3741520	3742520	I guess.
3742520	3743520	All right.
3743520	3744520	Say hi.
3744520	3745520	What?
3745520	3747520	Say hi to the listeners, mommy.
3747520	3749520	Hi, mommy.
3749520	3751800	Hi, this is Jamie.
3751800	3754160	I haven't seen you in a while, but hi.
3754160	3755160	Okay.
3755160	3756160	So here's the thing.
3756160	3760560	Tonight we're having a bad show because Loki is out.
3760560	3762800	Both Jamie and I are sick.
3762800	3764160	Like I got sick when I was in Boston.
3764160	3765160	Did I tell you this?
3765160	3766160	I don't remember.
3766160	3767160	I got really sick, so I've been sick.
3767160	3768160	Don't worry.
3768160	3769960	I've been going to work, but I'm sick.
3769960	3771960	And so everybody at work is sick.
3771960	3773960	Well hopefully not.
3773960	3777640	And the person that goes around my office telling people to go home when they're sick
3777640	3778840	because I don't want to get sick.
3778840	3782120	I just tell people I already had swine flu once, you ain't going to get it now.
3782120	3783120	Okay.
3783120	3784120	Here's the deal.
3784120	3788120	We were taking questions from chatters and I thought the chatters had a good question
3788120	3794280	and the chatter wanted to know, what do you think about your son, that would be me, playing
3794280	3795960	Dance Dance Revolution?
3795960	3800800	Like did you, did you ever know about this Dance Dance Revolution game that I was playing?
3800800	3801800	Uh huh.
3801800	3803600	And what did you think of it?
3803600	3806160	What did you think of it?
3806160	3808040	I thought it was good exercise.
3808040	3809040	It was.
3809040	3810040	It was good exercise.
3810040	3813040	I was probably never in my thinning, or I was never thinner than I was when I played
3813040	3814040	that, huh?
3814040	3815040	Except when you had pancreatitis.
3815040	3816040	That's absolutely true.
3816040	3817040	What, um.
3817040	3821520	Am I supposed to not like it or something because I don't have.
3821520	3822520	No, no.
3822520	3823520	I'll get.
3823520	3824520	Well, let me ask you this.
3824520	3829840	Were there ever video games that I played growing up that you didn't like?
3829840	3831280	That I didn't like?
3831280	3832280	Yeah.
3832280	3838160	Only the, I didn't, I wasn't particularly fond of the, uh, very violent games.
3838160	3840040	And why, why, why didn't you like that?
3840040	3845840	Did you think that I was gonna go out and do things and imitate what I saw in the games?
3845840	3852880	Well, it's just, I just don't think it's particularly good for children to be playing those kind
3852880	3856920	of games, war games and things like that.
3856920	3860440	Did you ever like catch me playing a bad video game and you like grounded me?
3860440	3861440	Cause I don't really remember.
3861440	3862440	No.
3862440	3863440	I just remember you.
3863440	3864640	No, because you had pretty good taste.
3864640	3866480	You didn't really like those violent games.
3866480	3867480	Well now that's not true.
3867480	3870920	See, I was really good at hiding it from you.
3870920	3871920	Well maybe so.
3871920	3872920	Maybe I just.
3872920	3875920	Never tell your mother how sneaky and devious you were as a child.
3875920	3876920	Oh, she knows.
3876920	3878700	She knows all about that stuff now cause it's funny.
3878700	3883480	My sister and I will get together and exchange stories with my mother sitting right there.
3883480	3885600	Okay.
3885600	3888960	But the other thing, the other thing, do you remember a game called Mortal Combat that
3888960	3891520	I used to play?
3891520	3892680	Yeah I didn't like that one.
3892680	3893680	Yeah.
3893680	3894680	Wasn't it gross?
3894680	3896680	It was pretty gross.
3896680	3900600	Cause I remember I was doing an impersonation earlier that you would come in the room and
3900600	3902680	you would say, Rob, what is that game?
3902680	3904120	That is a gross game.
3904120	3905120	Turn off that game.
3905120	3906120	It's gross.
3906120	3907760	That, that, that you were a little older then too.
3907760	3908760	You weren't real.
3908760	3912200	I mean you were like 14 maybe.
3912200	3913200	So it was okay.
3913200	3914680	I was, I was, I was at the point where it was okay.
3914680	3915680	You weren't real.
3915680	3919000	So I'm, you know, I'm thinking, you know, five, six, seven, eight.
3919000	3922240	I don't, I wouldn't think that would be appropriate for a child that age.
3922240	3923240	Okay.
3923240	3926320	Well I got one other question for you here.
3926320	3930760	And um, that question would be, um, why don't you like video games?
3930760	3932520	Cause you don't really play games.
3932520	3937260	What is, but you watch movies and you watch Oprah and American Idol.
3937260	3940840	So what, why don't you like games?
3940840	3943160	It's a matter of taste I guess.
3943160	3946480	And for one thing, I'm not that well coordinated.
3946480	3951360	I'd probably fail at it, you know, because I think you've been doing it ever since you
3951360	3952360	were a little kid.
3952360	3957480	So you're pretty well coordinated as far as, you know, you using the joystick and stuff.
3957480	3958480	I'm not.
3958480	3963640	So I'd rather be entertained rather than trying to entertain myself like that.
3963640	3964640	All right.
3964640	3966160	You're not interested in getting a Wii?
3966160	3971320	You don't want to do Wii bowling?
3971320	3973360	No, not really.
3973360	3974360	All right.
3974360	3975360	All right.
3975360	3977440	Well, do you give me a Wii?
3977440	3978440	You're going to give me a Wii?
3978440	3979520	You want, do you want a Wii?
3979520	3981160	Is that what you want for Christmas?
3981160	3985440	No, but you, you acted like you were trying to get me to say, Oh yeah, I'd love to have
3985440	3987040	a Wii so you could get me one.
3987040	3988040	You wouldn't use it.
3988040	3989040	That's why I'm not going to get you one.
3989040	3990040	You wouldn't use it.
3990040	3991040	You're right.
3991040	3994720	The first time I'd wear myself out and then I'd say never again.
3994720	3995720	All right.
3995720	3999720	Anything you want to say to the listeners of our fine radio program, uh, the, you know,
3999720	4000720	five people?
4000720	4009440	Ask them why they don't have something better to do.
4009440	4010440	Thank you for your love and support.
4010440	4011440	Mom.
4011440	4012440	I really appreciate it.
4012440	4014760	Oh, I, you know, I love and support you, so.
4014760	4015760	All right.
4015760	4016760	Bye mommy.
4016760	4018760	I love you.
4018760	4020040	Happy Easter to you too.
4020040	4021040	All right.
4021040	4022040	Bye.
4022040	4023040	Bye.
4023040	4024040	My turn.
4024040	4026320	You want to call your mother?
4026320	4027320	Is she up?
4027320	4028320	It's not too late over there.
4028320	4029320	What time is it?
4029320	4031160	10, 15 on the east coast.
4031160	4032360	My mom doesn't live on the east coast.
4032360	4033360	She lives in central.
4033360	4034360	Oh, central time.
4034360	4035360	So nine 15.
4035360	4036360	I don't care.
4036360	4037360	Wake her up.
4037360	4038360	All right.
4038360	4039360	Here you go.
4039360	4040360	Punch in the number one.
4040360	4041360	Mobile.
4041360	4044360	Okay.
4044360	4049680	Let's see.
4049680	4052200	It's Easter with the family here on orange lounge radio.
4052200	4054420	Oh, it did not like that number.
4054420	4055420	What did I know?
4055420	4058080	Mom's phone number acts wonky sometimes.
4058080	4060080	Can you show it to me one more time here?
4060080	4061080	Yeah.
4061080	4062080	Okay.
4062080	4063080	Sick.
4063080	4065080	The top one.
4065080	4066080	Okay.
4066080	4068800	Here we go.
4068800	4069800	Here it goes.
4069800	4070800	It's calling.
4070800	4071800	Dark soccer.
4071800	4072800	It's all you.
4072800	4073800	Hey.
4073800	4094880	Come on mom.
4094880	4095880	She went to bed.
4095880	4096880	You're in trouble.
4096880	4100360	She, she's not sleeping.
4100360	4101360	She's out partying.
4101360	4103360	Let's leave her voicemail.
4103360	4106520	Hi, this is Kathy.
4106520	4107520	I'm sorry.
4107520	4108520	I can't take your call right now.
4108520	4109520	Please leave me a message.
4109520	4110520	She's adorable.
4110520	4117040	At the tone, please record your message.
4117040	4121480	When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options.
4121480	4123760	Hi mommy.
4123760	4124760	It's your spawn.
4124760	4130720	Um, the female one, um, your voicemail is live on orange lounge radio.
4130720	4133440	We were trying to call you because it was funny.
4133440	4137680	Um, but you would have been an internet celebrity, but you missed your chance.
4137680	4138680	Sorry mom.
4138680	4139920	We were going to ask you about video games.
4139920	4140920	That's wrong.
4140920	4144240	Terrible influence they had on your child, but you know, I guess call back, call back
4144240	4145520	this number.
4145520	4146520	I don't think it'll work.
4146520	4150200	It's it shows up as like one, two, three, four, five, text, text Jamie and we'll call
4150200	4151200	you back.
4151200	4152200	Love you mom.
4152200	4153200	Bye.
4153200	4154200	Bye mom's voicemail.
4154200	4155200	All right.
4155200	4159520	Well, now we've successfully derailed the show three times over.
4159520	4160520	That was a lot of fun.
4160520	4163560	Hey, and we had a canine visitor.
4163560	4167080	I know, and I'm not a big fan of big dogs, so that kind of scared the hell out of me,
4167080	4168080	but thank you.
4168080	4169080	All right.
4169080	4172400	All of a sudden I just turn around, there's a dog in my life.
4172400	4173400	True story.
4173400	4177240	I was, did you know I was bit by a dog when I was five years old and I've had issues with
4177240	4178240	them ever since.
4178240	4179240	That's what you said.
4179240	4180240	I know.
4180240	4182240	Just in case the listeners don't know.
4182240	4183240	I do.
4183240	4184240	I'm not a fan of big dogs.
4184240	4189120	Just, you know, Hey, how about video games?
4189120	4198280	I put up the picture, I think I put up the picture of the very gay M&M's.
4198280	4200680	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars.
4200680	4204120	This game is only what a couple of years old, but we have some new news on it and it has
4204120	4209000	to do with the way it is selling and you might've heard not much, but apparently actually some
4209000	4215160	sales figures coming from February of 2010 apparently, and this is cumulatively up to
4215160	4223040	February of 2010 Chinatown Wars, the sales of that on the DS represents 50%, about 50%
4223040	4226920	of the sales of all M rated DS titles.
4226920	4231720	So meaning that when you take the other M rated titles, dementia, the ward, resident
4231720	4236120	evil, deadly silence, touch the dead core, ultimate mortal combat, and all these games
4236120	4241580	and you add them all up, it doesn't match what Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars has sold.
4241580	4245540	And this is kind of interesting because Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, the sales overall
4245540	4249740	have tended to be considered a disappointment.
4249740	4253240	And they even came out and said, uh, you know, they, they were blaming it on piracy that
4253240	4256640	the commercial performance of Chinatown Wars has certainly suffered at the hands of piracy
4256640	4259960	was a earlier quote, um, about that.
4259960	4263480	I think it's interesting because it just goes to show M rated games are not selling on the
4263480	4269180	DS, but at the same time, I kind of think, well, duh, most DS owners are kids.
4269180	4274820	Like really like, true story, I was at Outback last night, the table next to us, what does
4274820	4278880	the little kid have that's waiting for his little, little, little Joey, you know, what
4278880	4279880	is it called?
4279880	4283480	The young kangaroo menu, the Joey kid menu waiting for his little kid steak.
4283480	4287120	He was playing a DS, probably Pokemon or something.
4287120	4289440	The Pokemanses.
4289440	4294760	I mean the DS is like most popular with kids like tweens, if you will.
4294760	4297420	So of course the M rated games are not going to sell that well cause my mother would not
4297420	4299720	have bought me that game when I was growing up.
4299720	4301920	So there you go.
4301920	4304100	Uh, I don't know.
4304100	4305800	So maybe they just need to make some better games.
4305800	4309000	But honestly, I just don't think the DS is the platform for an M rated game.
4309000	4311000	It's mostly kids.
4311000	4312000	There you go.
4312000	4313000	Dark soccer.
4313000	4314000	What's up next?
4314000	4315000	Some stuff.
4315000	4318240	Um, Final Fantasy nine actually.
4318240	4326560	Um, they are, um, they're planning on putting, um, Final Fantasy nine on PSN and then it
4326560	4332400	was confirmed by Yoichi Wada, um, that, um, it would join Final Fantasy seven and eight
4332400	4334760	on the PS3.
4334760	4335760	So yay.
4335760	4336760	All the VV you want.
4336760	4337760	Well, why not?
4337760	4343840	It's free money, honestly, for putting a nostalgic game that everybody knows and loves back on
4343840	4344840	the PlayStation network.
4344840	4347360	Although it was probably a Final Fantasy a lot of people skipped over.
4347360	4349360	I don't think nine sold quite as well as the other ones.
4349360	4350360	I didn't play that much of it.
4350360	4354880	I actually, I played more of nine than I did of eight cause I actually liked nine.
4354880	4357440	I actually got past the first disc on nine.
4357440	4359520	I didn't beat it, but I went pretty far in it.
4359520	4360520	It was good.
4360520	4362400	It was a good game.
4362400	4366080	It was, you know, that more traditional Final Fantasy as opposed to that, uh, cyberpunk
4366080	4367080	kind of looking thing.
4367080	4368760	And that was its big thing.
4368760	4372160	So how about some Twitter topics?
4372160	4374920	I don't even know if we got Twitter topics tonight, but we're going to go ahead and take
4374920	4380120	some Twitter topics now on our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.
4380120	4386120	Although I'm trying to load the Twitter right now.
4386120	4392080	Hopefully I'll be able to filter out all the tweets about Justin Bieber, who is still a
4392080	4393080	trending topic.
4393080	4397240	And how much, how much is that swipe Twitter stupid?
4397240	4398240	Don't worry about it.
4398240	4400680	You're better off not knowing.
4400680	4403440	Let's see.
4403440	4410040	Oh, this story kind of hits close to home from a tiger clock.
4410040	4415280	SEGA confirms closure of internal Iron Man and Golden Axe developer.
4415280	4420680	Do you know where that SEGA office was located?
4420680	4421680	San Francisco.
4421680	4422680	Oh yeah.
4422680	4423680	I've driven by there.
4423680	4424680	Yeah.
4424680	4425680	A lot of us have.
4425680	4426680	It's right there off I 80.
4426680	4427680	You can't miss it.
4427680	4428680	Yeah.
4428680	4429680	SEGA studio.
4429680	4430680	San Francisco has been closed.
4430680	4431680	They were making the Iron Man movie tie in games.
4431680	4432680	Golden Axe beast rider.
4432680	4435120	Um, unfortunately the rumors were going around and they closed it.
4435120	4437320	That one hits very close to home.
4437320	4438320	That's a bummer.
4438320	4443760	I thought SEGA was having a resurgence in popularity with Bayonetta and, um, you know,
4443760	4446280	some of the, they got that game, they showed residents of fate.
4446280	4449240	Was that what it was called at PAX East actually looked pretty rad.
4449240	4453640	I got to say so SEGA is having a Renaissance, but I guess the Iron Man movie tie in games
4453640	4455960	are not exactly how to do it.
4455960	4457120	They'd ever made it with good control.
4457120	4459120	It might've been a different story.
4459120	4464440	Uh, blue swim sends us some tweets saying, Hey, any thoughts on cave shooter death smiles
4464440	4468560	getting a special edition with a nice Xbox 360 space plate and an OST CD.
4468560	4473240	And then he links us to an article on Kotaku that actually shows us what it looks like.
4473240	4476640	You know, there are some, definitely some shmup fans that are going to be really excited
4476640	4477640	about this.
4477640	4478640	And I think it's very cool.
4478640	4481200	I mean, I don't know if it's something I would spend the extra money on, but I think it's
4481200	4482200	cool.
4482200	4484840	Like it's cool that the games kind of come into the U S at all.
4484840	4487560	You know, like we just talked about how I think it was getting a limited edition in
4487560	4492220	Japan, but I guess this whole, actually this giant collection is only like 50 bucks.
4492220	4493220	That's not bad.
4493220	4496960	And again, can't say I'm a huge fan of it, so I don't know if I could justify spending
4496960	4502360	that kind of money, but I think it's cool that it's even coming out at all.
4502360	4504360	So that's neat.
4504360	4506760	Maybe a friend of mine will get it and I can check it out.
4506760	4507760	I don't know.
4507760	4512960	Uh, Alex P Carson says, O L R a your O L R logo is my Xbox gamer picture.
4512960	4513960	Well, thank you.
4513960	4514960	Did you know?
4514960	4518640	And it's been a long time, but you can actually search for what's called community gamer picks
4518640	4519640	on Xbox live.
4519640	4520880	And we're in the pack too.
4520880	4522640	It's like the all games radio pack.
4522640	4526560	It has a bunch of icons for a bunch of all games radio shows.
4526560	4529800	Uh, some of them aren't even on the air anymore cause it's been so long.
4529800	4535800	Uh, but, uh, you know, we, there's an icon for O L R. There's an icon for Bobby.
4535800	4539080	There's an icon for like video game outsiders and you know, there's a few shows that are
4539080	4540080	still on that have icons.
4540080	4541140	So check that out.
4541140	4542140	Community gamer picks.
4542140	4546680	They're hard to find, but you can probably find them on the website a little easier.
4546680	4549680	Um, evil protagonist says, I don't have a topic.
4549680	4552880	I just want to tell you all how much I look forward to listening each and every week.
4552880	4553880	Thanks for all you do.
4553880	4554880	All.
4554880	4555880	Thank you.
4555880	4556880	That's very nice.
4556880	4559000	And I apologize for this week's show cause it's kind of shit.
4559000	4562720	Blue swim also says, Rob, your mom's burn on the O L R listeners was Epic.
4562720	4563720	Yeah.
4563720	4564720	Well that's where I get it.
4564720	4569480	Lastly, spazzinator or good buddy asks a WTF question.
4569480	4575120	If major Nelson is the mouth of Microsoft, who is the asshole or appendix of Microsoft?
4575120	4576680	Ooh, that's a good one.
4576680	4579720	Who's the asshole of Microsoft?
4579720	4584320	Um, my best guess, I mean, I don't think there's anybody who's just like a straight up jerk
4584320	4588640	that I can think of, but definitely a lot of what comes out of Peter Molyneux's mouth
4588640	4591700	is.
4591700	4595640	So that would be my best guess for you.
4595640	4596640	There it is.
4596640	4601000	Rob, you know what I just got done typing?
4601000	4602000	What's that?
4602000	4603000	She'll cut a bitch.
4603000	4604000	For what?
4604000	4605000	It's a Kathy Griffin album.
4605000	4606000	Oh.
4606000	4607000	Isn't that a book?
4607000	4608000	Or something?
4608000	4609000	I don't know.
4609000	4613760	No, I think that it's one of our shows.
4613760	4615760	Oh, okay.
4615760	4618760	Couple more news stories for you guys and we have the classic game of the week.
4618760	4619760	Yeehaw.
4619760	4623720	Microsoft, speaking of which, well this is kind of an asshole thing to do, but not really.
4623720	4624960	I get why they're doing it.
4624960	4629560	They are suing Datel over the turbo fire controller.
4629560	4633400	It's a wildfire is what it's called in the UK, which is where Datel is from.
4633400	4636880	Unfortunately they say, you know what, this looks a little bit too much like an Xbox 360
4636880	4637880	controller.
4637880	4642840	And I got to say, yeah, it definitely kind of looks like an Xbox 360 controller.
4642840	4647960	But I kind of always thought the third party controllers all resembled the original controller
4647960	4649360	somewhat.
4649360	4656120	But yeah, Microsoft is seeking monetary compensation and an injunction preventing the company from
4656120	4658440	manufacturing any more of the devices.
4658440	4662280	Now Datel and Microsoft, they've been going back and forth for a little while.
4662280	4666120	I would guess that this was not a licensed Microsoft peripheral and that's part of the
4666120	4667120	problem.
4667120	4671400	Because you might remember Datel, they made the memory cards that got the shaft from Microsoft.
4671400	4675640	So I think that's what this, this is just these two companies just kind of going back
4675640	4677740	and forth at each other.
4677740	4680960	It's a bummer because maybe the D-pad on this thing would have been better.
4680960	4684560	And judging from the looks of it, it doesn't look so like a round D-pad, it might have
4684560	4686640	actually been a little better.
4686640	4688280	Kind of a bummer.
4688280	4692080	But hey, you know what, Microsoft, you know, they did make that controller.
4692080	4693080	And they patented it.
4693080	4698240	And if you make something a little too close, that's why people get sued, especially when
4698240	4700920	you're not already in the company's good favor.
4700920	4702320	Oh well.
4702320	4704520	Soon he's going to sue.
4704520	4705520	Everybody loves to sue.
4705520	4708680	All right, Dark Soccer.
4708680	4712400	I wish I could sue my face.
4712400	4713400	What a quote.
4713400	4721720	So there's an MMO that's called PokeNet that was a fan run MMORPG based on Pokemon.
4721720	4731360	And it was, actually Nintendo sent the request for them to shut it down at the end of March.
4731360	4741120	And they postponed closing it, but they actually formally shut it down on April Fool's Day.
4741120	4744120	And that's no joke.
4744120	4747920	There's just a number of them though that have been shut down, but this is just the
4747920	4748920	newest one.
4748920	4754400	And they said for the code that they created for the game, they're joking about using it
4754400	4759240	for Digimon or Monster Ranger, but most of their devs are giving up.
4759240	4762080	That would be a funny little F-you, I suppose.
4762080	4763640	That's a bummer, but it's not a surprise.
4763640	4767400	I mean, Pokemon is one of Nintendo's most treasured MMOs.
4767400	4771480	You know, I see that these guys are just trying to make the game that everybody wants, which
4771480	4772480	is the Pokemon MMO.
4772480	4775240	I mean, that's what like tons and tons of gamers everywhere want.
4775240	4776440	We've talked about it on this show.
4776440	4780480	It could be a great thing for the franchise, and for whatever reason Nintendo is just refusing
4780480	4783120	to do it.
4783120	4786360	Probably because of the fact that it's a kid-based game and that would be very hard to keep safe
4786360	4789040	and clean is probably part of the reason.
4789040	4794040	But I mean, it's a bummer, but I think Nintendo's within their rights, certainly, you know,
4794040	4795040	especially if it wasn't a quality product.
4795040	4797040	They're absolutely in their rights.
4797040	4801100	But I do think if the guys are that passionate about the product, they should go back and
4801100	4802840	make it a different type of monster.
4802840	4806720	I mean, that would take a lot of re-art and all that stuff.
4806720	4810640	And plus, if it's too close to the Pokemon idea, it might still get the smackdown.
4810640	4814920	But I mean, Pokemon and Digimon can co-exist, and you know, they're not that different.
4814920	4820800	I mean, yes, there's differences, but they come down to little pocket monsters and collecting
4820800	4825360	catch them all, catch them all, yada yada.
4825360	4826800	But Nintendo's done that a lot lately.
4826800	4832580	They shut down the Zelda project, the movie thing, remember that?
4832580	4835040	But you know, I get it.
4835040	4836440	They have a right.
4836440	4839440	You can't just go around making all this fake stuff because somebody out there is going
4839440	4842240	to think it's real, and then that's where the real problems start.
4842240	4845920	Well, this was real, and this was licensed by Nintendo.
4845920	4849080	And no matter what, Nintendo will never make this go away.
4849080	4851560	The Super Mario Brothers Super Show!
4851560	4856800	That's right, the one with, rest in peace, Captain Lou Albano, starred as Mario.
4856800	4862120	And of course, you know, they would do all these cute little live-action skits.
4862120	4863120	And then they had the cartoons.
4863120	4866520	Well, if you want to relive this from your childhood, or if you never got to experience
4866520	4868160	this as a child to begin with, guess what?
4868160	4869960	It's on Netflix.
4869960	4871280	So you can actually go check this out.
4871280	4873320	I believe it is on Instant Netflix right now.
4873320	4877880	So you can go stream volume one of the collection and check out what you missed as a kid.
4877880	4882800	I actually have, either volume one or volume two, I have one of the collections on DVD,
4882800	4886160	and it is so cheesy-cheeserific.
4886160	4887700	It's amazing.
4887700	4891160	Just to give you a clue how amazing, here's a blast from the past.
4891160	4892160	Listen up.
4892160	4893160	Hey, McDonald's!
4893160	4894160	It's the Mario Brothers Super Show!
4894160	4895160	We're with the Mario Brothers, and the plumbing's a game.
4895160	4896160	We're not with the others who get all the pain.
4896160	4897160	If you think it's no trouble, you can call us on the double.
4897160	4911720	We're faster than the others, you'll be hooked on the brothers.
4911720	4913680	You'll be hooked on the brothers.
4913680	4918760	Do you ever watch this show growing up, Jamie?
4918760	4919760	Yes.
4919760	4922960	Except I was really religious about watching Zelda on Friday.
4922960	4923960	Me too.
4923960	4927120	Well, excuse me, princess.
4927120	4932640	I don't believe that is a part of this, because the Zelda collection's different.
4932640	4941120	Zelda was on a different DVD, and I don't know if you can stream those yet.
4941120	4943280	The chat room's bitching about the audio quality.
4943280	4945280	Well, boo-hoo!
4945280	4946280	Alright.
4946280	4952480	Anyhow, it's that part of the show where we really like to take a look back at classic
4952480	4957600	gaming's history, and pick one game to spotlight in a segment we call our Classic Game of the
4957600	4958600	Week.
4958600	4963000	Dark Sakura's gonna dig through the gaming vault, she's gonna dive in head first, and
4963000	4965960	she's gonna sniff really loud, and whatever sticks to her nose first will be the game
4965960	4966960	of the week.
4966960	4971120	So, Dark Sakura, what did Nosepawn pick as the game of the week?
4971120	4975920	Actually, it was Dan that picked the game, so you can blame him.
4975920	4979920	I think it's a fabulous game you picked this week, so I thank Dan for this.
4979920	4984000	Well, it's Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island.
4984000	4988000	Aw yeah, one of the best ones in the whole damn series.
4988000	4989000	Wah!
4989000	4990000	Wah!
4990000	4991000	Wah!
4991000	4992000	Wah!
4992000	4993000	Anyway.
4993000	5000960	Basically, you go around as Yoshi, and you have baby Mario on your back, and you can
5000960	5007400	play different Yoshi's, and, um, it's supposed to be a prequel for Super Mario World, though,
5007400	5012640	technically, by the story, but I mean, your life bar is your baby Mario, and he falls
5012640	5016680	off your back, you have to go, he floats around in a little bubble and you have to go catch
5016680	5021600	him, and he gives the single most annoying cry ever.
5021600	5022600	Wah!
5022600	5023600	Wah!
5023600	5024600	Wah!
5024600	5025600	Wah!
5025600	5029880	Seriously, I think this game scared me away from children for a long time.
5029880	5036000	Um, but I mean, you go through, there's also, uh, you eat certain enemies, give you certain
5036000	5039760	colored eggs, you can throw them, you can eat certain enemies and shoot them just right
5039760	5049120	back at themselves, and, um, this is a pretty fun little game, um, and also, if you get,
5049120	5054720	um, a perfect score in all eight of the regular levels, you'll get a secret level, and there
5054720	5062600	are five flowers that you can pick up, um, in, in each stage, and you have red coins,
5062600	5073520	and all kinds of fun stuff that you can find, um, so basically you have to go and, uh, get
5073520	5077280	Baby Luigi back from Magikoopa Comic!
5077280	5084800	It also uses the Super FX2, um, for sprite scaling and polygon effects, and, um, all
5084800	5087000	kinds of stuff.
5087000	5097200	But, um, it was actually, um, the particular style for it, um, the rumor is that it came
5097200	5107240	from an internal evaluation committee conflict with Nintendo, and, uh, Miyamoto was, uh,
5107240	5113640	instructed to use the Donkey Kong Country style of pre-rendered graphics, and so he altered
5113640	5116520	them to look as if they had been drawn with crayons.
5116520	5117520	Interesting.
5117520	5121760	I always thought this game kind of had a unique look to it.
5121760	5123960	That's kind of cool that that's where it came from.
5123960	5124960	Hmm.
5124960	5125960	Yeah.
5125960	5126960	Very cool.
5126960	5127960	So that's it?
5127960	5131480	Yeah, that actually was given the award for Best Game of 1995 by EGM.
5131480	5132840	It is a great game.
5132840	5139960	As far as sequels, though, we've had, um, Yoshi Touch and Go and Yoshi's Universal Graviton
5139960	5140960	for the Game Boy Advance.
5140960	5141960	Oh, I remember Touch and Go.
5141960	5144840	And then Yoshi's Story came out on Nintendo 64.
5144840	5153760	There was Yoshi's Island DS, and, um, Yoshi's Island, um, was used in, um, the SNES and
5153760	5157560	Game Boy versions of Tetris Attack as a background.
5157560	5158560	I don't...
5158560	5159560	Is this on the Wii?
5159560	5160560	I don't think it is.
5160560	5161560	I don't think so.
5161560	5162560	I could be wrong.
5162560	5163560	I could be wrong.
5163560	5164560	Correct me if I'm wrong.
5164560	5165560	I don't think it is on the Wii.
5165560	5166560	No.
5166560	5167560	But that's, but that's it.
5167560	5168560	It's Yoshi.
5168560	5170080	This is also the game with Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy.
5170080	5172760	And that was an amazing moment in gaming history.
5172760	5176280	If you don't know what Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy is, I'm sure it's got to be on YouTube somewhere,
5176280	5177280	right?
5177280	5178280	Please tell me it's on you.
5178280	5179280	Hold on.
5179280	5180280	Maybe.
5180280	5181280	Touch Fuzzy.
5181280	5182280	There it is.
5182280	5183280	I can't type today.
5183280	5187280	I'm sick and there's earthquakes and I can't type.
5187280	5188780	Okay, here we go.
5188780	5189960	Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy.
5189960	5192920	And this is the level that's hilarious because when you would touch these big fuzzy looking
5192920	5195360	things, then your guy would just go psycho.
5195360	5196360	It was amazing.
5196360	5200360	And then he probably wouldn't do that.
5200360	5204000	See, I think this is like a speed run.
5204000	5205000	How about this one?
5205000	5208400	Touch Fuzzy, Get Stoned.
5208400	5210400	What is this?
5210400	5212880	Fucking people.
5212880	5215520	Apparently someone put in clips of Raiden DX.
5215520	5216520	Apparently.
5216520	5222800	Because that has everything to do with Super Mario Brothers.
5222800	5224200	Comments from our chat room.
5224200	5227200	Shao Ran says, that game, it kicked my ass.
5227200	5228200	I'm not afraid to admit it.
5228200	5231200	Tiger Claw said, never played this game, but it seems like Nintendo always retconned the
5231200	5232200	Mario games.
5232200	5234640	So Mario and Luigi knew about the Mushroom Kingdom since they were toddlers.
5234640	5238280	Well, if they were that young, they wouldn't have remembered it.
5238280	5241160	Salacious Pops says, I thought it had some kind of new chip in it that they debuted with
5241160	5242160	the game.
5242160	5243160	Yes, it was the FX2 chip, wasn't it?
5243160	5244960	Yeah, it was the Super FX2.
5244960	5245960	Yeah.
5245960	5249240	It made it a bitch to emulate for a long time, I remember.
5249240	5252440	That was one of the prized emulated games when it finally happened.
5252440	5255520	Well, believe it or not, we are reaching the end of our show, and the part where we're
5255520	5259680	going to open up the Skype line to your calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is
5259680	5261260	Orange Lounge Radio.
5261260	5262680	The phone lines are open.
5262680	5263680	We're taking calls right now.
5263680	5266840	It is a short show tonight, because as you can tell, we're a little bit sick and out
5266840	5267840	of it tonight.
5267840	5270960	So yeah, we're going to make it a short night here.
5270960	5275000	So go ahead and give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge
5275000	5276000	Radio.
5276000	5279280	This is the part of the show where I'd ask Loki for any last-minute stories, but I'm
5279280	5280280	guessing Darsagra?
5280280	5281280	Does she have any last-minute stories?
5281280	5282700	I don't have anything.
5282700	5284160	Her last-minute story is Benadryl.
5284160	5285560	That is her last-minute stories.
5285560	5288480	So we're just going to wait for the phone to ring here, because I don't have anything
5288480	5289480	either.
5289480	5293640	Damn it, call us, people!
5293640	5298200	Next week, Loki should be back, and hopefully he won't be sick.
5298200	5302200	We'll be fresh from my birthday beer pot look.
5302200	5303200	Yes.
5303200	5304200	Hopefully I'll be feeling better.
5304200	5306080	I'm having a beer pot look for my birthday.
5306080	5307880	It's going to be awesome.
5307880	5308880	I'm coming.
5308880	5310880	It's going to be fun.
5310880	5311880	So soon?
5311880	5312880	Shut up.
5312880	5314440	You know something we ought to look into for the show, by the way?
5314440	5319440	Last night at the show, at Rocky, somebody had this app on their iPhone 3GS that was
5319440	5324480	a Ustream app, so you could actually stream video from your iPhone.
5324480	5328640	So you might want to look into that for your phone, to see if we can do webcam again with
5328640	5329640	your iPhone.
5329640	5331440	And you could be the camera woman on the show.
5331440	5332440	Maybe.
5332440	5334520	It's going to be fun.
5334520	5336960	We'll see.
5336960	5338520	Is no one calling in?
5338520	5340120	Nothing's happening?
5340120	5346360	If you want to call in and share a story with us, you can.
5346360	5348360	I don't mind.
5348360	5351640	AlphaKananogram says I should leave a drunk voicemail from the beer pot look.
5351640	5357800	I'll probably have to drive, so I don't think that'll be happening, because I'm a good boy.
5357800	5360080	Some callers are saying that they get the voicemail when they call.
5360080	5363360	Well, nothing is ringing through, so keep trying, folks.
5363360	5366720	Hey, DarkTetsuya is probably calling in trying to talk about WonderCon.
5366720	5368920	Did you know that happened this weekend, WonderCon?
5368920	5373440	A big, big convention that happened in San Francisco over the weekend.
5373440	5376360	Was a huge deal.
5376360	5380960	I think it's like the second biggest comic book convention, only next to Comic-Con.
5380960	5383160	And yeah, it was going on in San Francisco this weekend.
5383160	5384160	Sadly, I couldn't go.
5384160	5390040	I was in San Francisco, but I'm still so sick, and I was kind of conned out, which is all
5390040	5391320	so bad.
5391320	5394880	You know what, I'm gonna restart Skype, just in case something is going wrong with the
5394880	5395880	Skypey thing.
5395880	5397840	Let me just quit, quit, quit.
5397840	5404960	I'm gonna quit, and I'm gonna reboot Skype, and we'll see if we get a call.
5404960	5411640	Of course, I have to log in, because I don't ever save the password.
5411640	5415760	And it is Easter, so it's a little bit slower of a night anyway, so we might not get a lot
5415760	5416760	of calls.
5416760	5417760	Bobby apparently had no calls on his show.
5417760	5420240	I thought he had at least one.
5420240	5422640	He had at least one.
5422640	5425480	Somebody said they were trying to call, but they got a busy signal, so I thought, okay,
5425480	5427280	let's restart Skype and see what happens.
5427280	5428280	It's my mom.
5428280	5429680	She did something.
5429680	5432960	My mother, when she told all the listeners to go outside, basically.
5432960	5434000	She grounded Skype.
5434000	5435000	She did.
5435000	5437640	She put Skype on time out.
5437640	5438640	So let's see what happens.
5438640	5447720	Skype line is open 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
5447720	5450400	Give us a call.
5450400	5454920	And BlackWolf said he did have one call, but it was an echo chamber, so it must have been
5454920	5458280	something going on there.
5458280	5463760	Any exciting plans for your week, DarkSakura, besides the beer potluck?
5463760	5466760	Maybe...
5466760	5468500	I don't know.
5468500	5470200	Probably doing homework, really.
5470200	5472120	Good times.
5472120	5475880	Nonstop party for you, DarkSakura.
5475880	5477840	What are you studying these days?
5477840	5481160	What are you gonna be when you grow up?
5481160	5489400	Hopefully a designer, which I'm already doing now, but I'm working on a website for my DreamMover
5489400	5490400	class.
5490400	5491400	Thank God, we're getting a call.
5491400	5492680	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
5492680	5493680	Who's this?
5493680	5495960	Yar had his revenge.
5495960	5497600	Hi, Bobby.
5497600	5498960	How are you?
5498960	5500000	I'm doing good.
5500000	5501200	Your Skype works, by the way.
5501200	5502680	Yeah, that's good to know.
5502680	5503680	Thanks, Bobby.
5503680	5508200	No, I'm glad you called, because we're always on your show, so it's only fair that you come
5508200	5509200	on to ours.
5509200	5511560	That means you've actually been listening to this trainwreck of a show tonight.
5511560	5514280	I'm so sorry.
5514280	5515440	It's been fun.
5515440	5517320	It's been very interesting, that's for sure.
5517320	5521920	What kind of games have you been playing this week besides Yar's revenge, obviously?
5521920	5523920	Astro Smash.
5523920	5527400	And no, I've been playing Final Fantasy 13 as the real game, quote unquote, that I've
5527400	5528400	been playing.
5528400	5530880	How far are you into that game at this point?
5530880	5536600	I am on Chapter 10, so if I was on the Xbox 360, I would have just put in Disc 3.
5536600	5541840	Wow, you are way past me, because I think I'm on Chapter 9.
5541840	5543320	That's the best place to farm Gil.
5543320	5545000	That's the airship, right?
5545000	5546000	No.
5546000	5547000	Actually, no.
5547000	5548000	I'm way back then.
5548000	5549040	I'm like maybe Chapter 7.
5549040	5553040	I'm in Palimporum, and I got to Hope's dad.
5553040	5555760	I'm not trying to spoil too much.
5555760	5556760	That's where I quit.
5556760	5560760	I got Hope's dad in the little emo scene with that, and then I stopped right after that.
5560760	5561760	That's where I'm at.
5561760	5567000	That's the best place to farm money, because all those soldiers drop those credit chips
5567000	5572080	and incentive chips, and those give 500 Gil and 2500 Gil each.
5572080	5573620	I'm going to remember that.
5573620	5576280	So when I'm on the airship, I should farm a crap ton of Gil.
5576280	5577280	Yes.
5577280	5578280	Pro tip.
5578280	5579280	I like that.
5579280	5580280	Good tip.
5580280	5585440	Any games that you're looking forward to that are coming out in the near future, Bobby?
5585440	5586840	Not really.
5586840	5587840	Not in the near future.
5587840	5589800	April is kind of a slow month all of a sudden.
5589800	5593640	I guess things are going to pick up once the Crackdowns and the Red Dead Redemptions and
5593640	5595040	all that start coming out.
5595040	5596040	E3.
5596040	5598560	Are you doing E3 this year?
5598560	5599840	I'm hoping to go to E3.
5599840	5605960	I did finally get my tax return, so I can finally start booking things, because I couldn't
5605960	5608640	go to PAX East because I decided buying a house was more important.
5608640	5609640	Well, yeah.
5609640	5610640	Priorities.
5610640	5611640	Priorities.
5611640	5616320	But I'm still a renter, so I had that disposable income that you needed.
5616320	5617760	But yeah, I'm definitely going to E3.
5617760	5620040	I'm making it happen.
5620040	5622280	Have you guys talked about the blur beta at all?
5622280	5623560	A little bit.
5623560	5624760	I have played it.
5624760	5626800	What do you want to say about it?
5626800	5629320	I still haven't figured out if it's...
5629320	5630320	I call it...
5630320	5631560	I say it's insane.
5631560	5635040	I haven't figured out if it's insanely good or insanely bad yet.
5635040	5636040	Why is that?
5636040	5637560	What makes the game insane?
5637560	5641640	Well, it's Mario Kart meets Need for Speed.
5641640	5642640	Which is a great idea.
5642640	5644440	That's basically what the game is.
5644440	5651520	It depends on the map that you're playing, if it's fair or not, if you're not extremely
5651520	5656980	good at it, or know all the sight lines and all that stuff.
5656980	5661840	And what sucks is that I'm only good at one map, and that's the one map nobody chooses.
5661840	5663460	But it is fun.
5663460	5667160	It's actually a game I don't mind playing with random people, because I just don't listen
5667160	5668760	to them.
5668760	5669760	I don't either.
5669760	5672600	I just don't turn on my headset when I'm playing that game.
5672600	5675600	Do you think you'll pick up the full version when it comes out?
5675600	5680820	I will at least rent it, because I want to see how the single player is.
5680820	5683480	I'm still looking forward to Split Second.
5683480	5689680	But what worries me about Split Second is that I don't want...
5689680	5694600	Because I loved full auto, because the demo I played at E3 was amazing.
5694600	5695600	It was awesome.
5695600	5696600	It was great.
5696600	5697600	Then I got the game, and I didn't like it all that much.
5697600	5700960	I know Loki did, but he's not there.
5700960	5706920	But I'm afraid Split Second made an amazing demo, and the rest of the game won't live
5706920	5707920	up to it.
5707920	5709400	And I'm really afraid of that.
5709400	5712160	Well, you know what's interesting is that they were parading Split Second around PAX
5712160	5715720	East, and it looks like they brought the same damn booth to PAX East that they had at E3,
5715720	5718360	although it was configured differently for the space.
5718360	5720360	I think it was the same demo, too.
5720360	5723760	I can't say that with 100% certainty, because I don't remember that far back, but I think
5723760	5726720	it was the same darn demo that we had at E3.
5726720	5728440	So it's interesting that this game is still not out.
5728440	5732760	At the airport or something, where the control tower's crashing around you and stuff.
5732760	5733760	It seemed like it.
5733760	5736480	I mean, I honestly didn't really play it again.
5736480	5739320	I watched for a little bit, and it just seemed the same to me.
5739320	5742280	It looked like I was looking at the same thing.
5742280	5746920	But I don't pick out a lot of those little graphical things and things like that.
5746920	5752320	I mean, imagine it has to be a newer version, but it was probably the same stages or something.
5752320	5753320	Not really.
5753320	5756800	I mean, because I guess looking from a game developer point of view, they're not gonna
5756800	5763300	spend too much more resources just to show kids at PAX East.
5763300	5768360	Because the PAX demo at PAX Prime was the same as the E3 demo.
5768360	5774120	So it's very possible that they just, instead of spending the money making a new demo, they're
5774120	5776320	trying to get the game out in time.
5776320	5779440	Because I think it's supposed to come out before E3, so they're not gonna spend time
5779440	5782720	making a new E3 demo, unless it gets pushed back again.
5782720	5789440	But I can't see them for PAX East, unfortunately.
5789440	5793120	I can't see them spending all that time making a new demo when they have a perfectly good
5793120	5796880	one from E3 that is impressive.
5796880	5797880	That's true.
5797880	5800280	And probably a lot of people that were at that expo had never played it before, because
5800280	5804040	it was a totally different crowd.
5804040	5808120	Well Bobby, anything else on your mind before we try to go back and see if we get any other
5808120	5809120	calls tonight?
5809120	5811480	Or maybe it'll just be you, who knows?
5811480	5812880	Yarr.
5812880	5815000	I'm gonna work on that this week, Bobby.
5815000	5818120	Like I told you on your show, I've never been better at Yarr's Revenge in my life until
5818120	5821840	you inspired me to kick your butt.
5821840	5823200	And you haven't kicked it yet.
5823200	5824200	I'm trying.
5824200	5825400	I've one-upped you a couple times.
5825400	5826800	I've made you work.
5826800	5827800	You have to admit that.
5827800	5828800	I made you work.
5828800	5829800	Yes, you did.
5829800	5830800	Alright, there you go.
5830800	5831800	There it is.
5831800	5832800	And then you bow down and go home.
5832800	5833800	Alright, shut up.
5833800	5834800	Alright.
5834800	5835800	Somebody else call in.
5835800	5836800	Don't make it just me.
5836800	5837800	Alright, have a good one, Bobby.
5837800	5838800	See ya.
5838800	5840000	Alright, so we know it works.
5840000	5841720	Bobby got through, at least the Skypline works.
5841720	5842720	We know that much.
5842720	5843720	I know it calls out okay.
5843720	5845280	We called my mommy earlier.
5845280	5848920	877-K-M-O-L-R, username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.
5848920	5852200	I'm starting to feel like really headachy, so I don't know how much longer we can keep
5852200	5853200	this show going.
5853200	5860040	But we're gonna try to get at least one more call in on our Skypline.
5860040	5862080	And then we're gonna wrap up the show.
5862080	5866320	We will be back next week with an all-new edition of OrangeLawnsRadio, of course.
5866320	5867680	Same bat time, same bat channel.
5867680	5872440	I think I mentioned it a minute ago, but I should make sure to plug this, because after
5872440	5875000	all we do steal the man's bandwidth every week.
5875000	5878000	Our old putty, putty, our old putty, putty, silly putty.
5878000	5883240	Our old buddy, Scott Rubin, who hosts, he's kind of the grand poopa, if you will, of all
5883240	5884240	games radio.
5884240	5889840	He is starting his own little show, but it's actually a big show, at Appaday.tv, and he's
5889840	5891380	reunited with Diane Miyazoda.
5891380	5892960	It's like G4, back when they were cool.
5892960	5893960	Hey, we're getting a call.
5893960	5894960	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.
5894960	5895960	Who's this?
5895960	5899800	Uh, this is Henderson Mann.
5899800	5901040	Well, hi, Henderson Mann.
5901040	5902040	How are you?
5902040	5903760	Oh, I'm doing alright.
5903760	5904760	Welcome to the show.
5904760	5907160	Yeah, I've been a long time listener.
5907160	5909040	I've probably listened for, like, the last two years.
5909040	5916080	In fact, it was your show that introduced me to all games radio years ago, and now I
5916080	5919520	have my own live show on Saturdays on all games.
5919520	5921520	What is your show?
5921520	5927440	Distributed Failure, where you come on at 3 p.m. Pacific time on Saturdays.
5927440	5929120	I have heard of that program.
5929120	5930120	Congratulations.
5930120	5931440	That is awesome.
5931440	5933600	So make sure Scott knows that.
5933600	5934600	That's good.
5934600	5937440	People have heard of us.
5937440	5938440	That's awesome.
5938440	5940120	Well, what is on your mind, my friend?
5940120	5942040	What do we do with a phone call tonight?
5942040	5945120	I just wanted to say, you know, you guys look like you're having trouble with Skype, and
5945120	5950060	I just wanted to call in and say hey and tell you guys I'm a long time listener, and I did
5950060	5954200	finish Final Fantasy XIII, which I thought was decent, but I still think it's low on
5954200	5956620	the totem pole of Final Fantasy games.
5956620	5957620	Not as low as VIII.
5957620	5961400	I think VIII is the worst Final Fantasy game ever created.
5961400	5965880	You and I can agree on at least one thing, that's for sure.
5965880	5970200	I didn't care much for VII either, but I did love IX.
5970200	5974880	I think IX is one of the best, at least it's the best one on the PS1 era.
5974880	5979960	I would rather level a character from I through VII on Final Fantasy XI than play five more
5979960	5982080	minutes of Final Fantasy VIII.
5982080	5985560	I even bought the PSN version to try to go back and finish it, because it's like one
5985560	5989800	of the only ones I've never finished, and I couldn't do it.
5989800	5991880	I still couldn't get to my first disc.
5991880	5996160	What made me mad originally when I played it is I got to a section of the game, and
5996160	5999720	it's kind of spoiler-ish, but not really, because basically...
5999720	6004120	There's only a six-month moratorium on spoilers, and it's passed, so spoil away.
6004120	6005120	Okay.
6005120	6009280	Your female character that's supposed to be your girlfriend in the game, I can't think
6009280	6012800	of her name right now, but there's a section of the game where you go to a location because
6012800	6017960	she gets taken, and when she gets taken, she's in this tower where all the enemies are level
6017960	6023600	one, and you're supposed to have a special summons or whatever that can raise the levels
6023600	6024600	so you can gain levels.
6024600	6029200	Well, I got stuck at a boss there and couldn't get past the boss, because the boss was too
6029200	6033880	tough, but I couldn't gain any levels because everything was level one.
6033880	6037280	I tried to leave, and it wouldn't let you leave, so I got stuck in this endless loop,
6037280	6039840	and I just eventually couldn't do anything, so I just quit playing the game.
6039840	6041440	Stupid-ass system in that game.
6041440	6042640	Just a dumb-ass system.
6042640	6046620	I mean, the whole weapon system was ridiculous, where you had to go around finding these items
6046620	6050520	to upgrade your weapons, so basically every battle in that game ended up being, oh, I'll
6050520	6055360	just summon this monster that takes forever to watch all of its animation.
6055360	6056360	Wonderful story, though.
6056360	6057360	I will say this.
6057360	6058900	Final Fantasy VIII had a great story.
6058900	6061440	They should have just made it the movie, honestly.
6061440	6063000	They should have just made it the movie.
6063000	6064000	Oh, well.
6064000	6070640	I did have a great story, but yeah, that was the gameplay ruined that game so, so much,
6070640	6075200	and I try to go back to it on PSP, and it actually looks decent on PSP, which is amazing
6075200	6078560	because, you know, it is a PlayStation 1 game, but that smaller screen and everything being
6078560	6083040	so compact, it does make the graphics stand out.
6083040	6088100	Even Yars' Revenge looks awesome on my LCD monitor, like, you know, there's just a certain,
6088100	6091840	there's just something to it that we didn't have back in, you know, the, back in the day
6091840	6092840	of gaming.
6092840	6095840	I attempted to play that game because I remember playing that game when I was like five and
6095840	6100480	six years old, dude, and I just remember you go in that little middle section and the bullets
6100480	6107680	wouldn't hurt you and all that, but man, it's, I picked up Adventure on there, but I haven't
6107680	6108680	tried it yet.
6108680	6113640	I just, I had to pick it up because, you know, it's Adventure, and then I also picked up
6113640	6116560	Crystal Castle, which is kind of hard to control on that.
6116560	6120920	Yeah, because, you know, that game needs a trackball, not a analog stick.
6120920	6122280	I can't imagine that that.
6122280	6125160	I haven't played that one yet, I'll be honest, I've kind of avoided it because I know it's
6125160	6130840	can't control that well, but I just, I worry about the whole trackball versus analog stick.
6130840	6134840	But Yars' Revenge, seriously, best five bucks I've spent on Xbox Live in the past, like,
6134840	6135840	six months.
6135840	6138880	I may have to pick that one up then, I've been looking for something, I think I also
6138880	6144600	picked up Kicker or Shailen Road or whatever it's called, that's, that wasn't too bad.
6144600	6149800	I really hope they bring out some better arcade games, I mean, I am disappointed they're waiting
6149800	6153160	until after April or, like, the middle of April or end of April to bring anything else
6153160	6156640	out, I think that's really killing the momentum of the people that really like Game Room.
6156640	6161640	Well, it'll be here before you know it, and my hope is, is that there'll be, like, a couple
6161640	6166440	huge games that come out, like, you know, BurgerTime, I'm just kidding, but, you know,
6166440	6167440	something like really huge, or like-
6167440	6170880	Oh, I would love some BurgerTime, dude, I would love BurgerTime.
6170880	6174400	Like a 90s era game, or something to just, like, really, like, knock people off their
6174400	6178040	feet for a minute, like, something like, I don't know, like, like, I don't know, like,
6178040	6180720	NARC or something, well, no, I guess Midway Games are-
6180720	6181720	Bad dudes!
6181720	6182720	We need bad dudes!
6182720	6183720	Okay, bad dudes.
6183720	6184720	So, Bad Dudes comes out of Game Room.
6184720	6187800	Are you a bad enough dude to eat a cheeseburger with the mayor?
6187800	6188800	And then-
6188800	6189800	The president.
6189800	6190800	The president.
6190800	6192480	Yeah, the mayor was Final Fight.
6192480	6193480	That's okay, though.
6193480	6197720	Uh, and then, yeah, and then, like, that'll get a lot of eyes back on Game Room, but hopefully
6197720	6201040	they get all their stinkin' server problems figured out by that point.
6201040	6204680	Hey, did you happen to see that that Data East collection that came out on Wii, or,
6204680	6208280	I don't know if that's came out yet or not, it's got BurgerTime and Bad Dudes on there,
6208280	6210280	so that's why I'm kinda hoping it'll come to Game Room.
6210280	6215320	It does, and, um, some of the, uh, uh, uh, I believe, I haven't played it myself, but
6215320	6218120	I believe it has, like, the sequel to BurgerTime as well.
6218120	6222800	Ooh, I love me some BurgerTime, I've been tempted to try to find that.
6222800	6223800	Yeah.
6223800	6227840	So, uh, it seems like a pretty good deal, I haven't played it myself, but it'll be pretty
6227840	6228840	cool.
6228840	6231560	Oh yeah, Dartitsu's reminding me in chat, NARC is M-rated anyway, so it can't come to
6231560	6232560	Game Room.
6232560	6233560	Whatever.
6233560	6234560	Technicality.
6234560	6238160	Just turned the blood into sweat, that's, that's what they did back in my day.
6238160	6241520	Alright, Henderson, man, we're gonna let you go to try and squeeze in one more call, but
6241520	6247160	thanks so much for the call, and, uh, Distributed Failure, Distributed Fai-, I'm sick, Distributed
6247160	6248160	Failure.
6248160	6249160	Distributed Failure.
6249160	6252800	Which I am failing to say the name of correctly, but, uh, it's a lot of fun.
6252800	6256120	What did they talk about on Distributed Failure, is it a techie show, is it a game show, is
6256120	6257120	it a-
6257120	6259880	It's a game show, we talk about what we've been playing, we talk about video game news,
6259880	6263880	kinda like this, um, kinda like all games radio in the past, we have live callers and
6263880	6269040	stuff, well, nobody ever calls into our show, hardly, so, um, but, you know, it's, uh, you
6269040	6270040	can find the-
6270040	6271040	That's alright, it happens to all of us.
6271040	6272040	Alright.
6272040	6275240	Yeah, I said you can find the archives at distributedfailure.com, so, you know, if anybody
6275240	6279600	wants to listen and check it out, it's there, and we're live on Saturdays, so.
6279600	6281200	Best of luck with your show, sir.
6281200	6282200	Alrighty.
6282200	6283200	Thank you very much, guys.
6283200	6286200	Tell the crew at Distributed Failure we all said hey.
6286200	6288720	Alright, and bye, Jamie.
6288720	6289720	Alright.
6289720	6290720	Bye.
6290720	6291720	Take care.
6291720	6295560	Alright, sniffle, sniffle, let's try to get at least one more call in, I don't know, something
6295560	6299240	seems to be borked with the phone, the actual phone people, I think, are having problems
6299240	6303680	tonight, I don't know why, I saw- you all heard me call my mother.
6303680	6307160	It seemed to be working fine, so, I don't know what's up.
6307160	6310120	Your guess is as good as mine.
6310120	6312800	We'll give it just a couple more minutes for a call to come in, and if it doesn't come
6312800	6316980	in, then I'll just chalk up the phone's not working to, uh, just get another thing going
6316980	6319080	wrong today, with, between the, uh, earthquakes-
6319080	6320080	They have the plague.
6320080	6321880	The rainstorm, and the plague.
6321880	6324800	Do you think zombie Jesus did it?
6324800	6329200	Apparently Rama's trying to call in, Dartitsuya's trying to call in, I think Spaznator on Twitter
6329200	6331840	said he was gonna call in, something appears to be wrong with the phone line itself, I
6331840	6339720	don't know what it is, like, watch, I bet if I call, like, I don't know, like, watch,
6339720	6350000	I'm gonna call my cell, right now, and it's calling.
6350000	6355880	And there, my phone's ringing, there it is, it's working.
6355880	6363880	I don't know, the phone's, uh, stupid, it's the earthquakes, just blame it on the earthquakes.
6363880	6369280	Alright, well, sorry guys, I don't know what to do, I guess we're just gonna have to close
6369280	6375080	up shop for the night, and blame the earthquakes for taking down Skype tonight.
6375080	6378600	You can't always leave voicemail, send us emails as well, mail back at orangesonshredder.com,
6378600	6381840	I know Dartitsuya probably wanted to call in to talk about WonderCon, but he also did
6381840	6386560	a fabulous write-up that's available on the site, orangesloungeradio.com, if you want
6386560	6391600	to read that, he has a whole little wrap-up on WonderCon, hopefully we'll get some of
6391600	6397100	these people in next week, I'm sure Rama wanted to call in to talk about Anime Boston, I know
6397100	6402800	he was there, but sadly, Skype got earthquakes or something, I don't know what's going on.
6402800	6411240	Shauran in chat says, blame it on the rain, I will, blame it on the rain, it is definitely
6411240	6414560	time to put the nail in the coffin of this week's episode of Orange Laundrio, but hey,
6414560	6417760	if you made it this far in the show, then you rock, thank you so much for tuning in
6417760	6422960	to our show, and supporting independent podcasting, even at its lowest.
6422960	6426600	If you liked our show tonight, all we ask, tell two people about our show, we swear it'll
6426600	6430680	be better next week, when we're better again and Loki's back, although I don't know, something
6430680	6433760	tells me there's some of our fans that probably thought tonight's episode is actually pretty
6433760	6434760	cool.
6434760	6437600	DarkSakura, thanks for being here and sticking it out through the show.
6437600	6438600	I live here.
6438600	6441800	I know, do you have a final thought tonight?
6441800	6444120	My Ben and Jill's kind of working.
6444120	6449280	My final thought is, Musinex is my friend, and I'm going to go take some more right now,
6449280	6453000	have a great night everybody, we'll see you next week with another edition of Orange Laundrio
6453000	6459640	that won't be so broken, and have a plan in case of an earthquake, just saying, just saying,
6459640	6462080	and over this next week, have your earthquake plan prepared.
6462080	6463080	Good night!
