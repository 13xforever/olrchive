Tonight April 11th 2010

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Konami announces a variety of new games

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Warhammer overcharges customers in Arrow

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
and an old classic game is a Latin translation

Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 362 of Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
For a moment it sounded like you were using a porn voice

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
A porn voice?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Yeah, a porn voice

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
What was porn-tastic about my voice?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
You were doing that little dip in your voice

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I was doing that wacky morning DJ

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Let's go to Techmaster Loki with a check on traffic

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
No traffic in the house

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay, let's go to Techmaster Loki with a check on the food

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
What's the food look like in the OLR studio today?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Awful and in a bag

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
Okay, for those who weren't listening to the wonderful Bobby Blackwolf

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
who tapes before us here at All Games Radio

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
www.allgames.com where of course we tape live every week

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
6pm Pacific, etc.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
We were doing our little call that Bobby always does to us at the end of the show

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
and we got the realization that Loki brought to the show with him tonight

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
KFC, but he usually brings chicken to the show

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
that's no surprise

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
but he didn't just bring any old KFC tonight

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
oh no, he brought a Double Down to the show with him

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
For those who don't know what a Double Down is

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Loki, please quickly define

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
What is the Double Down from KFC?

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
It's a new sandwich from KFC that just launched today I think

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
and it's basically instead of having some sort of bread holding a sandwich together

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
there is chicken strips holding bacon, cheese, and cheese sauce together

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
and it's supposed to be incredibly unhealthy

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
so that's why I tried it

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
because it would be funny

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
because it's like, oh my god, that's gross

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
yes, when you have that heart attack, it's gonna be hilarious

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
it smelled awful

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
it actually wasn't bad, but here's the problem

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
the cheese sauce is just awful

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
that's why I am not eating that

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
not because it's so unhealthy and full of bacon and grease and stuff like that

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
it's because that cheese sauce tastes like some blended

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
rotten mayonnaise, ranch, and cheese whiz together

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
and it's just, it's awful

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
so, if you do get Double Down, don't get it with the cheese sauce

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
otherwise it'll probably be good without it

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I mean, seriously, the strips themselves

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
it's all white meat and so it's healthy for you

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
no, just kidding, it's not healthy

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
you can get it grilled though

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
that's gonna really help with all the cheese on it

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I think though that if you got it grilled

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
well, it actually would be perfect for anyone doing a low carb diet though

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
I guess, but honestly, if I want to eat healthy, quote unquote, at KFC

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
I would probably get like a two piece meal

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
grilled with like mashed potatoes, no gravy, or something

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I know, I was just being funny

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
or I probably wouldn't go to KFC at all

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I would probably just eat a fruit salad

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I just was going to see if they had the Double Down

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
they did, so I got it, and

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I was sorely disappointed with that cheese sauce

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I figured, okay, it's just gonna be something that tastes like cheese

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
but it's like a melted consistency

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
but no, they had to spice it up with like ranch or something

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
it's just gross, and it's overpowering the entire

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
it smelled really bad, or whatever it is

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I could smell it from over here

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
so that's so unfortunate because I had high hopes for that

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
but, oh well

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I actually have a challenge for everybody

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
for next month

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
what's that?

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
no fast food for a month

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
good luck

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I've been

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
no, I've done it before

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
that wasn't the first fast food I've had in two weeks, so

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
it's not dinner that I have a problem with

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
that's really easy, it's lunch at work

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
is really hard, especially when I only have had a three minute lunch

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
but I'm starting a new job this coming week

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
which is exciting

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
I will tell you

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
day job

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
my BFF Becky

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
we have three days out of the week

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
we walk during lunch, and we bring our own lunch

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
and I have this huge mungus thermos thing

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
but the dollar store, Rob, is selling those cubes

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
those frozen cube things

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
that you can put in a thermal container

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
but no, it was something I was actually wanting to do

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
is do the one month fast food free challenge

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
and then

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
for, you know, average how many times you want

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
would normally go out for fast food

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
and then put the money that you normally would have spent

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
on a happy meal or something aside

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
and donate it to charity at the end of the month

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
questions from chat

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Zappi says, does Subway count as fast food?

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, what defines fast food?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
That's tricky

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
because you can't say anything without a drive-thru

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
because I've seen subways with drive-thrus

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
and subways with drive-thrus?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
God, that would be annoying

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay, I'll make a list

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Basically, okay, if it's a sandwich

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
you know, if it looks unhealthy, it probably is fast food

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
I would say the types like McDonald's and Sonic

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
I love Sonic

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
It's something like, we're getting way off topic

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
If they serve hamburgers or tacos

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Or maybe if fast food is okay

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
if you can keep it 10 grams of fat or less

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
I don't know

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Because at Subway it's really easy to do 10 grams of fat or less

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Okay, this is the thing

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Almost any of these

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
I'm talking about just like the

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
the really highly processed food, you know what I mean?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I include KFC in this too

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
because their chicken is just a gene bait

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
But seriously

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm giving it a start in May

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
because I know for a lot of people it's a habit to change

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Let's try to tie it in with some type of Wii Fit or DDR

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
That's what I was thinking

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
If you rub the food on a piece of paper

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
and it turns transparent

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
then it's probably fast food

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
The food or the paper

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
We gotta get back to

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Listeners, help give us ideas

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
and we'll formulate a contest

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
But seriously though, this is the first soda

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
and first fast food I've had in two weeks

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I ate my first soda today

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
That's only because I wanted to try to double down

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
So technically I ate very few calories

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
because I only had like two bites of that in a soda

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
So I'm doing good still

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
So what grade would you give the KFC double down here?

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I would give it probably a D

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
just because the cheese sauce

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
If it was at the cheese sauce

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
I would have probably given it like a B

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
The double down gets a D here on Orange Lounge Mornings

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
on KAllGames

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
It needs like American cheese melted on there

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
instead of the cheese sauce and it might be good

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Once in a while we talk about video games here on the program at Orange Lounge Radio

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Hey if you wanna pull up a chair and join us in our chatroom

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Or what they need to have instead of the cheese sauce

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
their gravy that they have

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
That would be perfect

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Okay enough, enough, no more food talk

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Let's talk about games, dark sakura

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Please tell me you've played a video game this week

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Rock band

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
A fuck ton of rock band last night for my party

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
What was the best beer at your beer potluck out of curiosity?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
What was the best one?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
The one that I brought of course

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I'm just kidding

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
You know what Rob, I've actually saved that chocolate beer for an occasion

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
And Dan's like, they bring you, what's this? Peach? What?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
It's good

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I like the black currant one but I've had tons of their different ones before

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I haven't tried the peach yet but I love the black currant

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
But the Young's is gonna be

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
I'm going to be having one every night when I get back from school

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Nice

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
That's gonna be my I'm not in school beer

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
There's still so much beer in my fridge really

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I wasn't really gonna drink any

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It's totally my fault but we went from food to beer

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
And just totally dodged the game

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Oh yeah, by the way, rock band, beer!

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Totally my fault, I enabled it

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
I had a Guinness, a couple of new castles, about three fat tires

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Clearly she was playing tapper

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Two Killian's Red

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Heather brought the Sierra Nevada but I really don't like Sierra Nevada at all

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
And then I was gonna go, I actually picked up the four pack

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
I was like, I'm gonna have, can't drink any more beer!

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I had no voice, my throat still hurts today

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And there was rock band?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
There was lots of rock band, all day, rock band

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
We stopped long enough for Dan to play outrun

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
And then him and one of my co-workers that showed up

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Played, it was either him, no I think it was my friend Gary anyway

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
They were playing Bad Dudes

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Awesome, oh like on the Wii?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
No the Xbox, was it Bad Dudes or Double Dragon?

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
It's Double Dragon, it's on the Xbox, not Bad Dudes

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I was like, are you a bad enough dude to eat some carrot cake?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Just the topic of Bad Dudes has come up on this show before

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
There is still a lot of cake left

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
If anybody wants cake, I have lots

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Will you FedEx slices of cake to our listeners?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I'm talking about people in this house

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
What kind of cake?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Chocolate and carrot

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
The carrot cake is actually really good

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Chocolate and carrot cake or chocolate and carrot cake?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Separate

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Oh the chocolate and carrot cake would be kind of rad

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
You could smoosh it together

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I don't like carrot cake

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
God damn it with the food!

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Would you like a piece of chocolate?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
No, I shouldn't, so I'm not going to

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
You should have some chocolate cake

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Take it with you

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Take it with you

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I can't take it with me, Laura

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I could build a house out of cake

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
That sounds like a fun project

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Should I just pitch the show for the Food Network?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I mean, should we leave all games and be on a more appropriate network?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
No, I have tons of game stuff I could talk about

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm just waiting

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Add three cakes

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
One of them is gluten free though, so I will be taking some to work

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
So cake mania, taproom

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I'm going to get cake right now

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Loki

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Here I thought this week's show would be better than the train wreck that was last week

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
But clearly, clearly I was underestimating the ability of this program

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, Loki, before you do your gaming week

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I already spoiled it and sent it to the listeners last week

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
But congratulations for you and Nellie are in order

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Yes, thank you, thank you

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
She is, ironically enough today

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
She is as pregnant as she was when she had the twins

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
So she is a little nervous, but less nervous today

11:11.000 --> 11:18.000
But yes, she's about 21 weeks and four days, I believe?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Three days? 21 weeks and three days

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah, so

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
One boy, we know that

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
So everything's cool so far

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Anyways, so games

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
So let me first start off with a story

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Because this is really odd, but awesome at the same time

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
So Friday, you know, it

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I think it was Friday, anyways

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
Friday, not this Friday, but last Friday

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
I get this mysterious package in the mail

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm like, what the hell is this?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Was it something I ordered off eBay and completely forgot about?

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Inside was an Xbox 360

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Apparently we have a listener who is staying anonymous

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
In the Austin, Texas area

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
And has sent me a 360 that was already J-tagged

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
To replace the 360 that I had stolen

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I don't know who we have in Austin, Texas

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I don't know either

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
That's not far from where Travis Donovan is, but

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
He doesn't really like this show

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
No, no, I don't know

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Whoever it was, they posted like a small little message

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
It was kind of in broken English, so I don't know if it's

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I don't know, anyways

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
So long story short, I'm very thankful for that

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And thankfully I do have

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Wait, how did they get your address?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't know

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Isn't that, doesn't that, wait, wait

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Doesn't that strike you as slightly creepy?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Like, I don't know if I would actually be excited about the Xbox

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
I would more be wondering, how did a listener get my home address?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
No, it was sent to my work, so

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Oh, have you said where you work on this program before?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I might have at one point

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Weird

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Maybe Namco sent it, they know where you work

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
Yes, that makes perfect sense

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
We learned that a couple of years ago

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Fun times

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
No, but anyways, I'm incredibly thankful for that

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
And, you know, I've been messing with it for

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Well, this last, you know, week or so

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Okay, but seriously, ask before you send us strange packages in the mail

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
It's always a nice thing to do

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Exactly, and I mean, definitely, I would

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
You know, that was incredible, and I

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
No, I mean, it's a very nice gesture

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Exactly

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
There is a small part of me where I'm like, oh, that's awesome

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Like, that's 90%, no, I was even like 95% awesome

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
But 5%, like, how did they get your address?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I wasn't even thinking about that, honestly

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I was like, woohoo, yeah!

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
No, but, no, it's been cool

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
So, I've been playing a lot of games, obviously

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
One more thought, could it have been the guy that we sicced the O.L. Army on?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Maybe just

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
In Austin, Texas? Would he, like, leave the state?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Maybe?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I don't know

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Alright, just cheers

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Alright

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
So anyways, so, games

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
What did I play this week?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I played, actually, some Japanese shooters

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
I was at Espegluda 2, actually played that quite a bit

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Went through kind of the

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
I figured I'd start off at the easy mode on there

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And it's pretty fun, it's a little different

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
I haven't really played a lot of the Japanese shmup games

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
But, it's pretty fun, a lot of dodging bullets and whatnot

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
So, definitely worth checking out if they ever bring it over here

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
Tried a little bit of Otomedius Gorgeous

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
That game is a little weirder than I thought

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
But it definitely has that whole Gradius vibe to it, of course

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
But that's pretty fun

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
And, played through more Final Fantasy XIII

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm now, well, I don't know if I should say Warmack

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Because that's kind of a spoiler, I guess

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
But, I'm to the point in the game where it kind of opens up, like, you know

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
How many hours in are you?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
16, but then again I'm cheating, remember, so

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Oh, right, that's right

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
So, I'm on chapter 11, I believe

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Okay, okay

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
And it opens up kind of like an overworld and stuff

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
And it's almost like in Wind Waker where you go, spoiler

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
You go under the ocean or whatever and you see Hyrule

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
And you're like, why couldn't the whole game have been like this, you know?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Why couldn't they have just done this instead?

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
Well, that's almost, to me, what this part of the game is for Final Fantasy XIII

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
For the people that are complaining, why isn't there an overworld in this?

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
You know, why couldn't they have done the whole game like this?

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
Because it's basically kind of like an overworld situation

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
But, at the same time there's all these side quests and stuff you can do

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
Which are kind of annoying, but they're relatively easy for me, I guess

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
And the narrative's kind of moving along a little bit, but I still don't know entirely what's going on

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
But I think I'm at the end, or close to the end

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
I just want to interject real quick, because the chatters were commenting on Loki's mic being all screwed up tonight

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
That's actually really my bad

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
I took Loki's mic to PAX East with me for the show that we did out there

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
And unfortunately he has our old spare mic, which is just an old mic we had lying around

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
And the audio settings were left on, every mic is different

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
And so, long story short, I've been having to adjust on the fly

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
So if Loki's audio is going up and down and changing around, that's me playing on the mixing board

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
So it should be all better now though, I think I found where it needs to be

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Sorry, listeners, sorry, Loki

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
And then, so yeah, it's alright, it's kind of neat

16:51.000 --> 16:59.000
And unfortunately those characters didn't seem like they were too much lesbians at this point in the game

16:59.000 --> 17:05.000
Although there was an embrace part of the game which I was like, are they gonna kiss?

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
I wasn't trying to go there, I was trying to keep quiet on the spoilery stuff

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
But I do think there are lesbians in Final Fantasy 13

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Yeah, they're close, we don't know how close, but they're close

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I think they're very close, just saying

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Cougar kitten thing going on there

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
There is definitely a cougar kitten thing going on

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Anyway, no more spoilers

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Alright, anyways, so yeah, it's pretty awesome

17:34.000 --> 17:42.000
And then, and there's a loud commercial for Lysol power toilet cleaner

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
Anyways, I believe that was it as far as games though

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
Granted, you probably guys know what JTAG consoles are for

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Nothing legit, Bobby would not approve, of course

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
Let me just say, there's a lot of Rock Band load content out there

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
Well, I'm hoping, Loki, you're only using it to do the import games and not the shady stuff

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Import games are okay, I think

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
I say import games, they don't bother to release, they're a fair game

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
That's my stance on piracy

18:17.000 --> 18:24.000
The only games I've ever really, really liked, just totally been hardcore pirating into would be the import stuff

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Especially back in the PS1 days

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
Because I'm not gonna pay to import games if the publisher doesn't believe in the game here

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
I did install a 640GB hard drive though in the shell of an old 360 case

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
So now I can use that because JTAG consoles allow you to do that

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
But it's awesome, I like playing games from other regions

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
Alright, if that's it for your gaming week, then I'll talk quickly about my gaming week

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
I actually didn't play a lot of new games, just kind of a potpourri, a lot, a lot of old games this week

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Especially on Xbox Live Arcade

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
I did play a little more Game Room, I guess I could say that, just a little more

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
I haven't really been working on the Yars Revenge duel with Bobby

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
Because actually, Bradley, Arkadian42, who hasn't been on this show in quite some time

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
But he was here last night

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
I randomly saw him yesterday, yes, he has smoked both Bobby and I

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I don't think Bobby can see that

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
But like, now I don't just have to beat Bobby, I have to beat Bradley

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And that's even, that's 130,000 points

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I actually messed a little bit with Game Room

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
And I noticed I got a lot of achievements really quick by just doing stuff

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
You can get about 100 points doing next to nothing

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
But you do have to actually play games to get more

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
But I bought Crystal Castles

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
Because I had a friend over who really wanted to see Crystal

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Because they remembered it from the 80s and they really wanted to play it

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
And I was like, okay, you know, I liked Crystal Castles enough

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Where I'll spend the money to get it

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
You know, it's like renting a movie

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
You know, five bucks is about how much it costs to rent a movie

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Because I buy all my games for both, computer and 360

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
And when we got it, I realized the control sucks

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Like really sucks for that game

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
Because the controller analog stick is no substitute for a trackball

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Not at all

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Tried to play it and then I thought, oh, it'll be okay

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Because I have it on the computer

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
And I can use the mouse

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
And the mouse makes a, because a mouse is basically an inverted trackball

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
So it makes a, it's not a perfect substitute

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
But it's probably the best one there is

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
So I figured, okay, I'll play Crystal Castles with the mouse

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Nope, can't use the mouse

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
I remember I, irritating

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I used to play that on the Apple II

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Way back in the day

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
And a mouse worked okay then

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
But I guess if they don't support it at all then

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I don't support it at all

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
It's awful

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Unless, I could have missed something

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
But, you know, what I did is I unplugged my 360 controller

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And it defaulted to keyboard controls

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
And I couldn't find an option in there to switch it to the mouse to control

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Which makes sense because you don't have a mouse on 360

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
And the game is kind of made for both

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
And it's very obvious

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
But it's just, you know, it's just these little things

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
That are just killing Game Room for me

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Like there's so much potential with Game Room

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
And there's so much that I really want to like about Game Room

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
But there's these glaring things that just irritate me

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Like, oh, why didn't you find this sooner you dummy

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
You know, just in the servers

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And, you know, just some of the things with it

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Um, let's see, look at our chat room

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
chat.orangelandrater.com

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Brad says, sucks, does not even begin to describe it

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad there

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Ah, alright, anyhow

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Um, chat.orangelandrater.com

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
If you want to join us

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
So, yeah, a little bit of Game Room

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And just some random other games too

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
On the arcade, you know, like playing

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Street Fighter and Puzzle Fighter

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
And Mega Man 9 and just random stuff

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
All throughout the week

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
And wow, lots of wow

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I rolled a Death Knight

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
My Death Knight's already level, just about level 61

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
PVP is super fun with a Death Knight

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I just want to say

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
It's a lot of fun

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
So, alright, um, let's get into some housekeeping tonight

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Of which I don't have an awful lot

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Um, just, you know, uh, join our Facebook

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
If you haven't already

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
You can also follow us on Twitter

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
At Twitter.com slash O-L-R

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
And definitely try to join us for a live show sometime

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
It's a much different experience when you listen live

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
6 o'clock Pacific, of course, 9 o'clock Eastern

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at AllGames.com

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
That's really all I have for housekeeping

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
We don't have any shows off that I'm aware of coming up

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Or anything else

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
So, we're just gonna keep right on truckin'

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
With some gaming news

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Quite a bit of gaming news coming out of Konami

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
They had a big press

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
They had their, um, uh, Gamers' Night this week, right?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Really, I didn't know

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
We didn't get invited

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Well, you know, but it's in L.A. now

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
I wouldn't have been able to go anyway if we did

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Oh, that's true, that's right

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
You know, and

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I always forget that they're not

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, they're not in the Bay anymore

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
So, yeah, I wouldn't have been able to go anyway

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
I don't know

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
It's kind of one of those things where, especially if they're

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
You know, one thing we don't have news on is, is DDR

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
And, you know, I realize that's kind of how we started

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Although, I guess

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I don't know if I should say this, but

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I don't know if I really should say this on the air

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
There's a very good chance we're gonna have an interview with them at E3 this year

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Very good chance

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I'm trying to pull some strings

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
So, uh, gonna be a, gonna be a fun E3

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Alright

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
You're going to E3?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Yep

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Alright, cool

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Good times

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Alright, anyhow, sorry

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
You already could tell some news from, uh

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I thought you, are you, well, you can't go

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Now, I wondered why you were so, like, nope, can't go

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Nope, there's no way I'm going to E3 this year

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And I was like, well, what, you're not even gonna ask? What the hell?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And now that we know that the wife is pregnant

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Now, that makes sense

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Cause isn't that right around the due date too?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
No, August

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh no, okay

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
So

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Well, you said a long time ago, Jamie, you couldn't go

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
You said school or something

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
I'm trying to graduate

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
So

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I'll go

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
I suppose if no one else wants to go, I'll go to E3

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And, you know, do whatever

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Alright, anyhow

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Konami, news

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Oh, I forgot to ask you

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
What?

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Because you went to PAX East, did they have any of the PlayStation Move stuff there?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Did you get the, hm, would you play it?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
No, there was no move at PAX East

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Yeah, they sucked

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Well, you'll have to listen to last week's show, no, I'm kidding

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I don't want to listen to last week's show

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Yeah, it was pretty bad

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Uh, hey, this week isn't turning out much better

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Uh, APB was there

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I think that's the one you would have liked the most

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah, they had a playable, they had playable ABP

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I definitely thought of you

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
I do have video I shot, I can show you at some point

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Awesome

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
That was the one that, well, actually, you would have really enjoyed the line

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
The Crackdown 2 was out on the floor

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Yep

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
And, uh, I don't know what else you really liked

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
But it just seemed there was a lot of Loki games there

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah, I wanted to check out Crackdown 2

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
But I'll wait for that

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
I'm actually going back to Crackdown 1 to try to finish, finish that

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
I mean, I finished it, but I have to find, like, ten orbs that I'm missing

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
Um, and, just, I'm trying to go back to some of the older stuff

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
But, really, I don't know, Crackdown 2 is going to be awesome

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I'm so sad that they pushed it to July

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
It's supposed to be coming out in May

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Alright, oh well

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Anyway, we had Konami news at some point, right?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Yes

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Alright

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
So let's talk about Konami

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
Uh, Konami is taking a page out of Capcom's book

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
Um, re-issuing one of their games and kind of giving it the whole HD treatment

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
Uh, Russian Attack Ex-Patriot is a brand new Russian Attack game

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Kind of looks very similar to Bionic Commando Rearmed

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
And they're doing the whole 2.5D, um, kind of update to it

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
And it will be available on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
And, of course, um, the game looks pretty cool

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
Except, honestly, I don't believe I liked Russian Attack very much

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Maybe just because it was very difficult

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It can't be a souped up version of the old arcade game

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
The old arcade game was too straightforward

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Like, it was a very old school 80s game

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Well, this is supposed to be pretty linear too, I think

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Interesting

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Well, you know, the little video I saw

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
It's ironic that you compare it to Capcom and Bionic Commando

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Because that's the first thing I thought of

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
And the look of it

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Just the color palette and stuff reminds me

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Just the look of it really looks like Bionic Commando Rearmed

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
But, sort of, to be fair, it looked a little bit like Shadow Complex as well

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Shadow Complex kind of has that same sort of style to it

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
It's not bad

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
With the 2D, 3D look

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh, yeah, it looked cool

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
The Russian Attack arcade game's okay

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
But here's the thing

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
Bionic Commando Rearmed, I think, really cashed in

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
I don't know why we keep comparing it to this

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
But it's just why, what I think when I see it

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Because they did it well

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
They were the best example of doing this

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
Yes, and, but Bionic Commando had a lot of nostalgia with it

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Like, I think more people remember Bionic Commando

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
Than remember Russian Attack

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Like, quick poll of our chat room

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
How many of you remember Russian Attack?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Like, not just, like, name, triggers

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Oh, yeah, I think that was a game somewhere

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
But, like, actually, like, can think of in your mind

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
How the game plays

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Like, just, you know

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Especially versus Bionic Commando

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Just a quick poll of chat

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Chirp, chirp

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Do you remember Russian Attack, Jamie?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
I remember looking at it

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And she's got a freaking vault of games

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
I don't think we have Russian Attack

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
She has a freaking game that came with a dish

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I mean, that's

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
That's true, I do have a game that came with a dish

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And she doesn't remember Russian Attack very well

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I mean, that ought to tell you something right there

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
So

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
And Dan's not here for us to

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
No, Zappy, not Russian

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
It's Rush in Attack

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Oh, yeah, I do remember that

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Rush and Attack

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Yes, but with an N

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
No, wasn't there an arcade one?

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Yes

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Yeah, we had it at my arcade

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Okay, oh, well, there you go

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
No, there was another game, though, that was

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I was thinking, never mind

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Yeah, we had it at my arcade

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Zappy in our chat room

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Russian Attack would be like Karnov

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
That's Russian Attack

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
It had that kind of oblique, all bold logo to it as well

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah, I remember it

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Rush in Attack was a game I fondly remember

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I remember going to a local grocery store

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
And putting a ton of quarters trying to beat the game

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
It was hard, but then when I had fun playing it on the NES

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw also jumps in that

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Russian Attack on the NES had two player co-op

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
I mean, Satsuma said

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
I remember playing an XBLA demo of Russian Attack

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Does that count?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
And yeah, that was one of those Konami games

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
They dumped a bunch of them on Xbox Live

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
When the arcade was first out

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
They were like a dime a dozen

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I mean, some of them were notable

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
You know Frogger, the old arcade game

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It was one of the first ones, so it was still pretty cool

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
JIRUS, like I really like that one

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Time Pilot, and there was a lot of obscure

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Scramble

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
They need a 2.5D HD remake of Contra

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
They had a Contra on it

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
But it was just the arcade version

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Well, yeah, but they had a sequel they did for WiiWare

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I mean, port that over

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I'll tell you one title, Konami

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
That will not work with this HD remix thing

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
And I think you've already done it anyways

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Frogger, please god, no more Frogger games

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Ever, no more

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I'm pretty sure it's already been done

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
There was a Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
But the funny thing about it

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
It's actually like the third or fourth Frogger 2

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
That's come out

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Cause like back in the Commodore 64 days

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
There was Frogger 2 three deep

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
There was Frogger 2 on the Playstation

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
And then there was this Frogger Swampies thing

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
I don't know, whatever

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Ooh, Dark Tetsuya has a good point

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
It used to be called Green Beret in Japan

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
If I recall correctly, I think he's right

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I think that game was called something completely different overseas

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I think it was called Green Beret, that's right

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I remember the game on Xbox Live

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
But like before that, not really

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
You know, so again

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I just, you know

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
If the nostalgia is what they're trying to cash in on

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I don't think there's a lot of nostalgia there

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
So I sort of hope the game can stand on its own two feet

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I mean, the game can rise above the nostalgia

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
If it's a great game, it won't matter

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
That it ties into this obscure ass 80s game nobody remembers, right?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Exactly

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
So we'll see, I guess

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
I imagine there'll be more of this

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
At E3?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Probably

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Robert M says, Rush and Attack was on the Game Boy Advance compilation, wasn't it?

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
I am like 95% positive, yes it was

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It was on that Game Boy Advance compilation

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
That had all the old school Konami games from the 80s

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I don't know if they called it that

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It might have been on its other name, I don't know

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Anyhow, lots of games were announced at the Konami event

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
One of them is Saw 2

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
That's right, Saw 2

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Is going to be coming out

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
It's being developed by Zombie Studios

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
They did the first game as well

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
It's coming out for Halloween

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Just in time for the movie

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I think they have said that they will keep making those damn movies

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Until they stop making money

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Considering those movies cost less than 10 million dollars to make

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
You're gonna have a lot of Saw movies, guys

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Unfortunately

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I gotta admit though

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I'm kind of surprised that a Saw sequel is happening

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Because I didn't think the first game did very well

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I could be wrong

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
It didn't do that well, I don't think

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Honestly, having seen all the Saw movies

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
The last one was alright

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I kind of liked it

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
But

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
It's getting to the point

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
The game or the movie?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
The movie

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
The games have nothing to do with the movies

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
They don't follow the plots of the movies

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
They try to do their own thing

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Sort of

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
But I'm just saying

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
They basically killed off

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Jigsaw in the second movie

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
The third movie

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Maybe the second movie

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I can't remember which one

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I think it was the second one

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
It kind of makes it difficult

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
To

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Keep having this guy do it

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Because now you have someone else

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Taking over for him

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
It's just getting ridiculous now

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Um

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
You know what?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
According to VGcharts.com

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Again, take this with a grain of salt

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Because I don't know how accurate these numbers are

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
But according to VGcharts.com

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Saw pushed.21 million

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
On the Xbox 360

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
That's 200,000

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
And then.23 million on Playstation 3

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
So it actually sold better on Playstation 3

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And so that would be a combined half million

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
So

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Not bad

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
But they only sold that I think right at launch

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I don't think that they really

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
It was a title that kind of

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Made its money the first

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Two months and then just

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Nothing

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
And I should say that is worldwide

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Because actually the game did much better overseas

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Than it did in the Americas

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Which is kind of interesting

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Oh and that explains why the PS3

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Sold more

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Actually the Xbox 360 sold more in America

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
And only 100,000 on PS3

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Don't get me wrong it was an alright game

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Again take those sales figures with a grain of salt

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah and I think the game was alright

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
It was kind of repetitive I guess

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And you know

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
The new game though

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Apparently is going to have some better puzzles in it

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
They were talking about one that was

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Being shown off as a demo

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
And apparently no one figured it out

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Unless they were told how to do it

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
So I don't know if that's good or not

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
But it's interesting

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
They're saying of course more

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Yucky gross death machines

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Which is the whole thing that kind of turns me off

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Of the Saw series and I will admit

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
It's weird like I have no problem with

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Konami's other franchise

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Silent Hill but it's

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I have no problem with the gore in that game

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
But it's Saw bugs me

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I can't explain it and maybe it's because

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Saw is a bit too real

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Whereas like Silent Hill

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Obviously Pyramid Head is not real

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
It's supernatural

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
It's a little more supernatural

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I can't explain what the difference is

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Saw just

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I don't know

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I've talked about this on the show before

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
It's just torture porn to me

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
It doesn't excite me

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
I get that there's people into it

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
But I'm just not one of them

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Whatever they're making a new game

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I guess the first one didn't sell as bad as we all think it did

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
If those numbers are any indication

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I don't think a half million combined worldwide is terrible

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Certainly there's games that do a hell of a lot worse

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
But I don't think it was a launch of a franchise

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
As they had hoped

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
They were hoping that this was going to be their next Silent Hill franchise

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
And

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I think Silent Hill does a lot better

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Interesting

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Well Dark Sakura

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
What?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
You have some more news for us out of Konami

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Yes I do

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
But I'm still kind of

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
About it

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
There is another Silent Hill game

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
In the works for PS3 and Xbox 360

34:12.000 --> 34:18.000
But they didn't really give out any other information about that

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Just said that it's another one

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I'm surprised by this news

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I assumed that Silent Hill was done

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Because I assumed that Homecoming did not perform well enough

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
It didn't

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
But I mean

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Shattered Memories did okay

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
But I actually returned my copy

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
Wasn't the rumor that what they were showing

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Like a Shattered Memories type of game

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Not necessarily like Homecoming

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I thought I heard something

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
The rumor is it's supposed to be like a

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Like what Shattered Memories was to Silent Hill 1

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
This is supposed to be to Silent Hill 2 or something

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I don't want that

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I don't want to play that

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I didn't really enjoy that much of Shattered Memories

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Weird

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I just like

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Plain old good Silent Hill

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Last decent one was 4

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
And that's it

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Silent Hill Shattered Memories on the Wii

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
.18 million

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
So that's less than

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
And again these numbers are coming from vgcharts.com

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That's much less than what Saw moved

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
How did Homecoming do?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
The problem is

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Homecoming moved.36 million

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
That's on the 360

35:24.000 --> 35:36.880
And how much on PS

35:36.880 --> 35:38.880
Whatever the reason

35:38.880 --> 35:40.880
You can put out really awesome mature games on it

35:40.880 --> 35:42.880
But no one's buying them

35:42.880 --> 35:44.880
Well the other thing that strikes me odd

35:44.880 --> 35:46.880
About the fact that they're continuing the Silent Hill franchise

35:46.880 --> 35:48.880
I mean even if the Silent Hill Wii game

35:48.880 --> 35:50.880
Was critically well received

35:50.880 --> 35:52.880
Is the departure of Akira Yamaoka

35:52.880 --> 35:54.880
Because to me

35:54.880 --> 35:56.880
He was such a key component of that franchise

35:56.880 --> 35:58.880
I really don't see how they can continue it without him

35:58.880 --> 36:00.880
I mean if it's true that they're just

36:00.880 --> 36:02.880
Redoing the second game

36:02.880 --> 36:04.880
I suppose I can see that

36:04.880 --> 36:06.880
Because how much did he really

36:06.880 --> 36:08.880
Contribute to Shattered Memories

36:08.880 --> 36:10.880
I don't think he did a lot

36:10.880 --> 36:12.880
For that game

36:12.880 --> 36:14.880
Did he even do the soundtrack?

36:14.880 --> 36:16.880
Yeah he worked on the soundtrack

36:16.880 --> 36:18.880
I think they finally learned

36:18.880 --> 36:24.880
That they really can't do anything else with the series

36:24.880 --> 36:26.880
They don't have the right kind of

36:26.880 --> 36:28.880
I think thought process to take it where it needs to go

36:28.880 --> 36:30.880
That's just my thought

36:30.880 --> 36:32.880
Interesting comment from the chat room

36:32.880 --> 36:34.880
Because this could

36:34.880 --> 36:36.880
Spar another discussion here

36:36.880 --> 36:38.880
S.H.O. 100 Matt in our chat room

36:38.880 --> 36:40.880
I remember the great horror movies of the 80s

36:40.880 --> 36:42.880
When it was about the scare

36:42.880 --> 36:44.880
No matter how cheesy the effects were

36:44.880 --> 36:46.880
Whereas now it's shot gore

36:46.880 --> 36:48.880
He goes on to say the thing

36:48.880 --> 36:50.880
80s version is better than any Saw or Hostile movie

36:50.880 --> 36:52.880
And then somebody brought up

36:52.880 --> 36:54.880
DJ Dark Knight says

36:54.880 --> 36:56.880
Nightmare on Elm Street, nothing more

36:56.880 --> 36:58.880
And Friday the 13th

36:58.880 --> 37:00.880
And it's interesting because they've remade

37:00.880 --> 37:02.880
I mean Nightmare on Elm Street is coming out in a couple of weeks

37:02.880 --> 37:04.880
Right?

37:04.880 --> 37:06.880
And it seems odd to me that those are not turning into games

37:06.880 --> 37:08.880
I mean

37:08.880 --> 37:10.880
Sure there was a Friday the 13th game

37:10.880 --> 37:12.880
Years and years ago on the NES

37:12.880 --> 37:14.880
Which by the way I enjoyed way more than most people did

37:14.880 --> 37:16.880
Just on the tangent

37:16.880 --> 37:18.880
I actually

37:18.880 --> 37:20.880
I hate to say it because I know I'm going to get made fun of

37:20.880 --> 37:22.880
But I don't care

37:22.880 --> 37:24.880
I actually enjoyed the Friday the 13th game when I was younger

37:24.880 --> 37:26.880
It made sense to me and I had a lot of fun playing it

37:26.880 --> 37:28.880
It was hard as hell

37:28.880 --> 37:30.880
That angry video game nerd

37:30.880 --> 37:32.880
His review of it, it was funny

37:32.880 --> 37:34.880
And there was a Nightmare on Elm Street game too

37:34.880 --> 37:36.880
If I remember right

37:36.880 --> 37:38.880
Which was crap

37:38.880 --> 37:40.880
It was crap, but if my memory is right

37:40.880 --> 37:42.880
It was one of the very few Nintendo games

37:42.880 --> 37:44.880
That used that four player expansion

37:44.880 --> 37:46.880
They had

37:46.880 --> 37:48.880
Remember how they had the four player thing on the NES

37:48.880 --> 37:50.880
There was very few games that used it

37:50.880 --> 37:52.880
I know that you could change your main character

37:52.880 --> 37:54.880
And that it was still really lame

37:54.880 --> 37:56.880
And every character sucked

37:56.880 --> 37:58.880
Pretty much

37:58.880 --> 38:00.880
With the Saw and the horror franchises

38:00.880 --> 38:02.880
Doesn't it seem odd to anyone

38:02.880 --> 38:04.880
That there is not a video game

38:04.880 --> 38:06.880
Coming out for Nightmare on Elm Street

38:06.880 --> 38:08.880
Or even that there wasn't one for Friday the 13th

38:08.880 --> 38:10.880
There hasn't been one for Halloween

38:10.880 --> 38:12.880
Or any of the horror movies

38:12.880 --> 38:14.880
They've made in quite some time

38:14.880 --> 38:16.880
No, I'm not surprised

38:16.880 --> 38:18.880
Why is that?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.880
First you have to pay the licenses

38:20.880 --> 38:22.880
For that and they have an idea

38:22.880 --> 38:24.880
Of how well

38:24.880 --> 38:26.880
These games

38:26.880 --> 38:28.880
Perform

38:28.880 --> 38:30.880
And something like that it would be kind of hard to expand on

38:30.880 --> 38:32.880
The storyline

38:32.880 --> 38:34.880
And stuff like for example Nightmare on Elm Street

38:34.880 --> 38:36.880
Well

38:36.880 --> 38:38.880
What the hell would the game be about

38:38.880 --> 38:40.880
I mean you basically going after

38:40.880 --> 38:42.880
Freddy I guess

38:42.880 --> 38:44.880
Or you know trying to escape him

38:44.880 --> 38:46.880
It's just hard to expand on

38:46.880 --> 38:48.880
How you know whether enemies and stuff

38:48.880 --> 38:50.880
Are you going to have in it

38:50.880 --> 38:52.880
It just doesn't translate well into a game

38:52.880 --> 38:54.880
It's strange though

38:54.880 --> 38:56.880
Because so many movies that come out these days

38:56.880 --> 38:58.880
Get games with it like you know Avatar had a game

38:58.880 --> 39:00.880
Alice in Wonderland had a game

39:00.880 --> 39:02.880
Avatar learned itself very well to the game

39:02.880 --> 39:04.880
Yeah that's easy though to do

39:04.880 --> 39:06.880
There's plenty of characters in that

39:06.880 --> 39:08.880
That you can build a game off of

39:08.880 --> 39:10.880
And same with the Alice in Wonderland

39:10.880 --> 39:12.880
So there's plenty of creatures and enemies

39:12.880 --> 39:14.880
And stuff you can create for the game

39:14.880 --> 39:16.880
I read a very interesting article this last week

39:16.880 --> 39:18.880
That said that

39:18.880 --> 39:20.880
It was on Yahoo

39:20.880 --> 39:22.880
And the little teaser was

39:22.880 --> 39:24.880
This movie franchise

39:24.880 --> 39:26.880
Could have been a video game

39:26.880 --> 39:28.880
This movie franchise

39:28.880 --> 39:30.880
Is losing tons of potential dollars

39:30.880 --> 39:32.880
Because there is no video game

39:32.880 --> 39:34.880
And you click on it to find out what franchise they're talking about

39:34.880 --> 39:36.880
Any guess?

39:36.880 --> 39:38.880
Twilight because I read this

39:38.880 --> 39:40.880
What's funny is they forgot

39:40.880 --> 39:42.880
There is a game based on Twilight

39:42.880 --> 39:44.880
Well it's the scenic game

39:44.880 --> 39:46.880
That's still a game and it's based on Twilight

39:46.880 --> 39:48.880
So they're stupid because they did the research

39:48.880 --> 39:50.880
I blame

39:50.880 --> 39:52.880
No

39:52.880 --> 39:54.880
I don't want to see it either

39:54.880 --> 39:56.880
But they make a point

39:56.880 --> 39:58.880
It's strange that there is no

39:58.880 --> 40:00.880
Twilight video game

40:00.880 --> 40:02.880
I don't want to see it either

40:02.880 --> 40:04.880
It doesn't make a good game that's why

40:04.880 --> 40:06.880
But if they make a game for Alice in Wonderland

40:06.880 --> 40:08.880
And Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

40:08.880 --> 40:10.880
There's more characters

40:10.880 --> 40:12.880
Push A to sparkle

40:12.880 --> 40:14.880
Exactly it's not like

40:14.880 --> 40:16.880
She's running around slaying

40:16.880 --> 40:18.880
Vampires or slaying werewolves or whatever

40:18.880 --> 40:20.880
She's just some whiny emo chick

40:20.880 --> 40:22.880
And that's

40:22.880 --> 40:24.880
You can't make a game based on that

40:24.880 --> 40:26.880
Push B to lock the door and cry

40:26.880 --> 40:28.880
I mean it's seriously

40:28.880 --> 40:30.880
You can't, you can't really do that

40:30.880 --> 40:32.880
There's no

40:32.880 --> 40:34.880
Enemies for the fight, she doesn't do that

40:34.880 --> 40:36.880
It doesn't translate well, they'd be like

40:36.880 --> 40:38.880
The equivalent of making a game based off

40:38.880 --> 40:40.880
Of

40:40.880 --> 40:42.880
Anything

40:42.880 --> 40:44.880
Like the money pit

40:44.880 --> 40:46.880
Or you know just

40:46.880 --> 40:48.880
I'm getting yelled at by chatters because they're saying

40:48.880 --> 40:50.880
Rama's saying no Twilight game for PS3 360

40:50.880 --> 40:52.880
That's a smart move, Tigerclaw says don't give them any ideas

40:52.880 --> 40:54.880
Do you really want a Twilight MMO?

40:54.880 --> 40:56.880
Again, I have zero interest in the game

40:56.880 --> 40:58.880
But the capitalist

40:58.880 --> 41:00.880
Money making

41:00.880 --> 41:02.880
America fuck yeah side of me

41:02.880 --> 41:04.880
That's all about making money does say

41:04.880 --> 41:06.880
You know a Twilight game on the Wii

41:06.880 --> 41:08.880
That's not, I'm talking about an actual Twilight game

41:08.880 --> 41:10.880
Is a lost opportunity

41:10.880 --> 41:12.880
It really is, I have

41:12.880 --> 41:14.880
No fucking interest in it but

41:14.880 --> 41:16.880
I know there's a lot of girls that would play it

41:16.880 --> 41:18.880
Here's how you do it, okay, and this is how you can

41:18.880 --> 41:20.880
Translate most of those games that don't

41:20.880 --> 41:22.880
Necessarily, or most of those movies that don't

41:22.880 --> 41:24.880
Necessarily work as games into games

41:24.880 --> 41:26.880
And have them still be

41:26.880 --> 41:28.880
Alright

41:28.880 --> 41:30.880
You do them the way they did

41:30.880 --> 41:32.880
Heavy Rain

41:32.880 --> 41:34.880
That's the only way you can do it

41:34.880 --> 41:36.880
Is that you have some sort of context based

41:36.880 --> 41:38.880
Game

41:38.880 --> 41:40.880
That has a narrative

41:40.880 --> 41:42.880
That looks just like the movie

41:42.880 --> 41:44.880
That's really the only way you can do it because

41:44.880 --> 41:46.880
As far as being an action game

41:46.880 --> 41:48.880
Or anything like that, you can't do that

41:48.880 --> 41:50.880
With these games, it makes no sense

41:50.880 --> 41:52.880
Frisbee in our chatroom says

41:52.880 --> 41:54.880
Hey, I'd like a Twilight game if you got to play

41:54.880 --> 41:56.880
As Blade

41:56.880 --> 41:58.880
They really

41:58.880 --> 42:00.880
Could do the

42:00.880 --> 42:02.880
A dating sim

42:02.880 --> 42:04.880
You know

42:04.880 --> 42:06.880
And that would sell amongst the

42:06.880 --> 42:08.880
God, that just makes me feel dirty

42:08.880 --> 42:10.880
What was that shirt I saw at Hot Topic?

42:10.880 --> 42:12.880
And then Buffy staked Edward, the end

42:12.880 --> 42:14.880
That's great

42:14.880 --> 42:16.880
I would wear that shirt

42:16.880 --> 42:18.880
It was pretty awesome

42:18.880 --> 42:20.880
I knew you would wear that shirt, okay, sorry

42:20.880 --> 42:22.880
I would rock that with pride

42:22.880 --> 42:24.880
Look, I want to put out a formal apology to our listeners

42:24.880 --> 42:26.880
And everybody for bringing up Twilight on

42:26.880 --> 42:28.880
Orange Lontrenio, it was inappropriate of me

42:28.880 --> 42:30.880
And I apologize, so

42:30.880 --> 42:32.880
Please, let's move on with a different video game

42:32.880 --> 42:34.880
It'll never happen again

42:34.880 --> 42:36.880
I'm

42:36.880 --> 42:38.880
Do you think that I'm having an allergic reaction

42:38.880 --> 42:40.880
To that, Rob? No, you're just sparkling

42:40.880 --> 42:42.880
Ahh

42:44.880 --> 42:46.880
Loki, help

42:46.880 --> 42:48.880
Loki, help! I'm sorry

42:48.880 --> 42:50.880
Well, one easy way to defeat

42:50.880 --> 42:52.880
The Twilight series is to take

42:52.880 --> 42:54.880
A nice gun with a chainsaw

42:54.880 --> 42:56.880
And rip it in half

42:56.880 --> 42:58.880
And that's what you can possibly do in the new

42:58.880 --> 43:00.880
Gears of War game, which, funny enough

43:00.880 --> 43:02.880
Was supposed to be announced on the Jimmy Fallon

43:02.880 --> 43:04.880
Show, but apparently

43:04.880 --> 43:06.880
It got bumped to Monday

43:06.880 --> 43:08.880
And

43:08.880 --> 43:10.880
Nobody told Xbox Live

43:10.880 --> 43:12.880
Because apparently on the Xbox Live

43:12.880 --> 43:14.880
Marketplace, there is a wonderful banner

43:14.880 --> 43:16.880
Announcing the Gears of War 3

43:16.880 --> 43:18.880
Game, which will be

43:18.880 --> 43:20.880
Coming April

43:20.880 --> 43:22.880
2011

43:22.880 --> 43:24.880
That's a year off

43:24.880 --> 43:26.880
Yeah

43:26.880 --> 43:28.880
And I just want to point out

43:28.880 --> 43:30.880
I speculated earlier this year that

43:30.880 --> 43:32.880
Gears of War 3 would be an E3 announcement

43:32.880 --> 43:34.880
So maybe I screwed that up, but

43:34.880 --> 43:36.880
That it was going to support Project Natal

43:36.880 --> 43:38.880
Is that, does that seem to be the case?

43:38.880 --> 43:40.880
Doesn't say

43:40.880 --> 43:42.880
Don't know, but there's been some sort of

43:42.880 --> 43:44.880
Rumors saying that the

43:44.880 --> 43:46.880
It will feature, I guess, underwater

43:46.880 --> 43:48.880
Combat this time and mech suits

43:48.880 --> 43:50.880
I

43:50.880 --> 43:52.880
Well, I mean, not that I think it needs

43:52.880 --> 43:54.880
To support Natal, it was just kind of my gut feeling

43:54.880 --> 43:56.880
Was they were really, they've been really

43:56.880 --> 43:58.880
Really quiet about such a big franchise

43:58.880 --> 44:00.880
For them, and so I kind of thought that

44:00.880 --> 44:02.880
It was going to be like, oh Gears of War 3

44:02.880 --> 44:04.880
E3 and it's Natal, that's why

44:04.880 --> 44:06.880
We've kept it so under the wrap

44:06.880 --> 44:08.880
Under the wraps, but

44:08.880 --> 44:10.880
I guess, you know

44:10.880 --> 44:12.880
We'll hear more about it, maybe

44:12.880 --> 44:14.880
If you want to watch Jimmy Fallon on Monday, I guess

44:14.880 --> 44:16.880
Or just wait for the YouTube to hit

44:16.880 --> 44:18.880
15 minutes later

44:18.880 --> 44:20.880
Because, you know, I'd rather

44:20.880 --> 44:22.880
Not subject myself to

44:22.880 --> 44:24.880
An hour of that, I just watched the highlights

44:24.880 --> 44:26.880
Actually, I have to admit, I'm not

44:26.880 --> 44:28.880
Huge on Gears of War either, I'm just not

44:28.880 --> 44:30.880
Good at it, like Gears of War

44:30.880 --> 44:32.880
A, I suck at first person shooters

44:32.880 --> 44:34.880
To begin with, B, the thing about

44:34.880 --> 44:36.880
Gears of War is it's very about like cover

44:36.880 --> 44:38.880
And very like, like stealth and being able

44:38.880 --> 44:40.880
To move around and be very tactical

44:40.880 --> 44:42.880
Whereas, I like, if I'm going to play

44:42.880 --> 44:44.880
An FPS, I've got to play something like Quake 3

44:44.880 --> 44:46.880
Which is just kamikaze, run out there

44:46.880 --> 44:48.880
Shoot everybody with rocket launchers, kill kill

44:48.880 --> 44:50.880
Die die, you know, type of

44:50.880 --> 44:52.880
Stuff, I'm not good at Gears of War because

44:52.880 --> 44:54.880
I have, I can't cover

44:54.880 --> 44:56.880
Like, I just run out and shoot everything

44:56.880 --> 44:58.880
And I always die

44:58.880 --> 45:00.880
So

45:00.880 --> 45:02.880
And it's stuff like that is why

45:02.880 --> 45:04.880
You know, Gears of War

45:04.880 --> 45:06.880
Makes a better game franchise than

45:06.880 --> 45:08.880
Twilight, because there's no

45:08.880 --> 45:10.880
Rocket launchers and

45:10.880 --> 45:12.880
I mean, there's people dying, but

45:12.880 --> 45:14.880
They just whine about it

45:14.880 --> 45:16.880
SSG100Matt

45:16.880 --> 45:18.880
Says, don't support NBC, go Team Coco

45:18.880 --> 45:20.880
So,

45:20.880 --> 45:22.880
It's saying that you shouldn't, you shouldn't

45:22.880 --> 45:24.880
Watch the show anyway, you should just wait for

45:24.880 --> 45:26.880
Whatever will show up on Xbox

45:26.880 --> 45:28.880
Live inevitably anyway

45:28.880 --> 45:30.880
In support of Coco

45:30.880 --> 45:32.880
Who I'm seeing live next week

45:32.880 --> 45:34.880
Very excited

45:34.880 --> 45:36.880
Well, yay for you Rob

45:36.880 --> 45:38.880
That's right, I should buy tickets for that

45:38.880 --> 45:40.880
I think they're all sold out everywhere

45:40.880 --> 45:42.880
Well, I meant for Sacramento

45:42.880 --> 45:44.880
I don't know

45:44.880 --> 45:46.880
Alright

45:46.880 --> 45:48.880
Anyhow, moving on to another story and

45:48.880 --> 45:50.880
Yeah, those tickets were pretty expensive

45:50.880 --> 45:52.880
But this is even more expensive

45:52.880 --> 45:54.880
Apparently, Warhammer Online

45:54.880 --> 45:56.880
Or Mythic Entertainment if you will

45:56.880 --> 45:58.880
The makers of Warhammer Online

45:58.880 --> 46:00.880
Somehow charged a $14.99

46:00.880 --> 46:02.880
Monthly fee several times

46:02.880 --> 46:04.880
To gamers this past week

46:04.880 --> 46:06.880
Dozens of times, in fact there's a screenshot

46:06.880 --> 46:08.880
Here of a banking record where

46:08.880 --> 46:10.880
That monthly fee was charged

46:10.880 --> 46:12.880
It looks like

46:12.880 --> 46:14.880
17 times on somebody's

46:14.880 --> 46:16.880
On somebody's banking log here

46:16.880 --> 46:18.880
And that means like

46:18.880 --> 46:20.880
An overcharge of like

46:20.880 --> 46:22.880
Between $200 and $500

46:22.880 --> 46:24.880
Apparently, one player is reporting

46:24.880 --> 46:26.880
That they were charged for

46:26.880 --> 46:28.880
$1,013.12

46:28.880 --> 46:30.880
Because it had just come up that a six month

46:30.880 --> 46:32.880
Subscription was up and he got charged

46:32.880 --> 46:34.880
For that like multiple times

46:34.880 --> 46:36.880
Not cool because

46:36.880 --> 46:38.880
A, you don't know what caused the error

46:38.880 --> 46:40.880
Which is gonna be bad for EA and

46:40.880 --> 46:42.880
Mythic

46:42.880 --> 46:44.880
They're trying to refund the fees within 24 to 36 hours

46:44.880 --> 46:46.880
But here's the problem

46:46.880 --> 46:48.880
People are gonna start bouncing

46:48.880 --> 46:50.880
Checks, they're gonna overdraft

46:50.880 --> 46:52.880
And they're gonna threaten

46:52.880 --> 46:54.880
Mythic or EA with this

46:54.880 --> 46:56.880
EA's gonna have to pay for all these overdraft

46:56.880 --> 46:58.880
Fees that they cause

46:58.880 --> 47:00.880
Without a doubt

47:00.880 --> 47:02.880
And so that's just not pretty for them

47:02.880 --> 47:04.880
That sets them back, that's a big boo boo

47:04.880 --> 47:06.880
But you gotta be, that's the one reason

47:06.880 --> 47:08.880
To be careful with these automatic withdrawals

47:08.880 --> 47:10.880
But it stinks because so many games

47:10.880 --> 47:12.880
Kinda require them in this day and age

47:12.880 --> 47:14.880
But makes you think about maybe

47:14.880 --> 47:16.880
Using those prepaid cards instead

47:16.880 --> 47:18.880
Because you don't want something like this

47:18.880 --> 47:20.880
Happening to you I'm sure

47:20.880 --> 47:22.880
I mean I don't think anybody

47:22.880 --> 47:24.880
Did this intentionally or purposely

47:24.880 --> 47:26.880
I mean surely it was an error, it's just

47:26.880 --> 47:28.880
A really crappy error

47:28.880 --> 47:30.880
That is just

47:30.880 --> 47:32.880
Really no one wins in this scenario

47:32.880 --> 47:34.880
No one wins

47:34.880 --> 47:36.880
And it's not like Warhammer Online was a game that was

47:36.880 --> 47:38.880
It kinda didn't need

47:38.880 --> 47:40.880
Something like this on its reputation

47:40.880 --> 47:42.880
Right now, it's very unfortunate

47:42.880 --> 47:44.880
Can you imagine if something like that happened with WoW?

47:44.880 --> 47:46.880
Oh my gosh

47:46.880 --> 47:48.880
Oh my gosh, banks would go under

47:48.880 --> 47:50.880
From all the people that would complain

47:50.880 --> 47:52.880
And rise up

47:52.880 --> 47:54.880
My gosh

47:54.880 --> 47:56.880
I don't think it affected everyone that played

47:56.880 --> 47:58.880
But I think just those that probably had their statements

47:58.880 --> 48:00.880
Renewed on a certain day but still

48:00.880 --> 48:02.880
Stinks, too bad for them

48:02.880 --> 48:04.880
Let's see

48:04.880 --> 48:06.880
Rama in our chat says

48:06.880 --> 48:08.880
That happened to me with a hotel for Anime Boston

48:08.880 --> 48:10.880
Took them two weeks to refund my money

48:10.880 --> 48:12.880
So, so irritating

48:12.880 --> 48:14.880
That companies can do that

48:14.880 --> 48:16.880
But you know what, if it results in overdraft fees

48:16.880 --> 48:18.880
And it's this company's fault

48:18.880 --> 48:20.880
You should take them to task for it

48:20.880 --> 48:22.880
They'll refund the money, they have to

48:22.880 --> 48:24.880
Alright, anyhow

48:24.880 --> 48:26.880
That's messed up

48:26.880 --> 48:28.880
I know

48:28.880 --> 48:30.880
I mean, I looked at that and I was just like

48:30.880 --> 48:32.880
Yet another reason to hate Warhammer

48:32.880 --> 48:34.880
You know what though, that could have happened at any game though

48:34.880 --> 48:36.880
Because I would bet money

48:36.880 --> 48:40.880
That EA Mythic contracts another company to handle all this

48:40.880 --> 48:42.880
And that company botched up

48:42.880 --> 48:45.880
And it's just really unfortunate

48:45.880 --> 48:47.880
Because like I said, yeah, Warhammer already

48:47.880 --> 48:49.880
Hasn't had the greatest rep

48:49.880 --> 48:51.880
I mean, it has its loyal fan base

48:51.880 --> 48:53.880
But it's definitely not been the wow killer

48:53.880 --> 48:54.880
It was originally imagined to be

48:54.880 --> 48:56.880
I played it for a while, it was okay

48:56.880 --> 48:58.880
It's just, you know, I didn't get everything out of it

48:58.880 --> 49:00.880
I was hoping for

49:00.880 --> 49:02.880
Well, how about something happier?

49:02.880 --> 49:04.880
How about it?

49:04.880 --> 49:06.880
Doctor Who?

49:06.880 --> 49:08.880
On PC, we get a Doctor Who game

49:08.880 --> 49:10.880
Who?

49:10.880 --> 49:12.880
Doctor

49:12.880 --> 49:14.880
Who?

49:14.880 --> 49:16.880
Do not make me go hunt down my sonic screwdriver please

49:16.880 --> 49:18.880
Anyway

49:18.880 --> 49:20.880
Starting on June 2010

49:20.880 --> 49:22.880
There are going to be four

49:22.880 --> 49:24.880
Interactive episodes

49:24.880 --> 49:26.880
That are going to be free on the

49:26.880 --> 49:28.880
BBC Doctor Who website

49:28.880 --> 49:30.880
With the current cast

49:30.880 --> 49:34.880
And the new producer, writer guy

49:34.880 --> 49:36.880
And

49:36.880 --> 49:38.880
A lot of

49:38.880 --> 49:42.880
The story elements, I guess, going on with what's currently

49:42.880 --> 49:44.880
I guess going to happen in this season

49:44.880 --> 49:46.880
And it's being developed by Sumo Digital

49:46.880 --> 49:48.880
They

49:48.880 --> 49:50.880
It actually was said by

49:50.880 --> 49:52.880
The head of drama for BBC Wales

49:52.880 --> 49:54.880
The executive producer for Doctor Who

49:54.880 --> 49:56.880
The director of the series

49:56.880 --> 49:58.880
The director of the series

49:58.880 --> 50:00.880
The executive producer for Doctor Who

50:00.880 --> 50:02.880
There aren't going to be

50:02.880 --> 50:04.880
13 episodes

50:04.880 --> 50:06.880
There will be 17 of which

50:06.880 --> 50:08.880
Are interactive

50:08.880 --> 50:10.880
Interesting

50:10.880 --> 50:12.880
So they're really considering this part of the television arc

50:12.880 --> 50:14.880
Yep

50:14.880 --> 50:16.880
Of course if they let us download it over here

50:16.880 --> 50:18.880
Then I will

50:18.880 --> 50:20.880
Talk to people

50:20.880 --> 50:22.880
Yeah, exactly

50:22.880 --> 50:24.880
Torchwood?

50:24.880 --> 50:26.880
Any chance we can get a Torchwood game?

50:26.880 --> 50:28.880
Are we ever going to ever get Torchwood?

50:28.880 --> 50:30.880
No, it's over

50:30.880 --> 50:32.880
But that doesn't mean they won't do games

50:32.880 --> 50:34.880
Yes it does

50:34.880 --> 50:36.880
They ended it, they completely ended it

50:36.880 --> 50:38.880
But can't they go back and do games

50:38.880 --> 50:40.880
From, you know, the canon earlier

50:40.880 --> 50:42.880
In the show or something?

50:42.880 --> 50:44.880
I seriously doubt that's going to happen

50:44.880 --> 50:46.880
They do that all the time with franchises that are over

50:46.880 --> 50:48.880
They reinvigorate it for a game

50:48.880 --> 50:50.880
Okay, I'll give you that

50:50.880 --> 50:52.880
Where's my northern exposure?

50:52.880 --> 50:54.880
Shut up

50:54.880 --> 50:56.880
Actually, I'll say this not to deviate

50:56.880 --> 50:58.880
To sci-fi nerd-dom for a minute here

50:58.880 --> 51:00.880
But wasn't there a talk that Fox wanted to do

51:00.880 --> 51:02.880
An American version of Torchwood?

51:02.880 --> 51:04.880
Dear God, no, I hope not

51:04.880 --> 51:06.880
And something about

51:06.880 --> 51:08.880
The guy, why can't I remember his name?

51:08.880 --> 51:10.880
The guy that plays Captain Jack

51:10.880 --> 51:12.880
They actually were thinking of having him

51:12.880 --> 51:14.880
Do it

51:14.880 --> 51:16.880
No, um

51:16.880 --> 51:18.880
Not that Captain Jack, the other one

51:18.880 --> 51:20.880
Why can't I remember his name? Oh my God

51:20.880 --> 51:22.880
John Barrowman

51:22.880 --> 51:24.880
The guy that played Captain Jack

51:24.880 --> 51:26.880
And sang all those songs and dressed up like a captain

51:26.880 --> 51:28.880
With hoochies hanging off of him

51:28.880 --> 51:30.880
That Captain Jack?

51:30.880 --> 51:32.880
No, not that Captain Jack

51:32.880 --> 51:34.880
John Barrowman

51:34.880 --> 51:36.880
This is Captain Jack

51:36.880 --> 51:38.880
It's such a common name

51:38.880 --> 51:40.880
How about release dates, Loki?

51:40.880 --> 51:42.880
Captain Gack

51:42.880 --> 51:44.880
This week, there's

51:44.880 --> 51:46.880
Well, there's not a lot because we're in the month of April

51:46.880 --> 51:48.880
And April's really light

51:48.880 --> 51:50.880
There are some notable things

51:50.880 --> 51:52.880
First off, of course

51:52.880 --> 51:54.880
Splinter Cell Conviction

51:54.880 --> 51:56.880
Coming out on Xbox 360

51:56.880 --> 51:58.880
That's pretty sweet

51:58.880 --> 52:00.880
Grand Theft Auto episodes

52:00.880 --> 52:02.880
From Liberty City

52:02.880 --> 52:04.880
Making its way out onto the Playstation 3

52:04.880 --> 52:06.880
As well as PC

52:06.880 --> 52:08.880
Blood Bowl finally coming out

52:08.880 --> 52:10.880
On PSP this week as well

52:10.880 --> 52:14.880
And there's gonna be

52:14.880 --> 52:16.880
Nothing else, I guess

52:16.880 --> 52:18.880
That is one hell of a light week

52:18.880 --> 52:20.880
Alright, let's go to

52:20.880 --> 52:22.880
I need to say something real quick

52:22.880 --> 52:24.880
Okay

52:24.880 --> 52:26.880
Since I hate having to spell this shit out

52:26.880 --> 52:28.880
Because apparently I do every time I state something

52:28.880 --> 52:30.880
That's my opinion

52:30.880 --> 52:32.880
When I say something is over

52:32.880 --> 52:34.880
I'm typically meaning it's over for me

52:34.880 --> 52:36.880
I don't care

52:36.880 --> 52:38.880
It's good

52:38.880 --> 52:40.880
It's over for me, I don't care

52:40.880 --> 52:42.880
It's gone

52:42.880 --> 52:46.880
Okay, well I took what you said to mean that the show is actually over

52:46.880 --> 52:48.880
So it's not over, it's just you've written it off

52:48.880 --> 52:50.880
Because you don't like the direction it's going in

52:50.880 --> 52:52.880
They got rid of everybody

52:52.880 --> 52:54.880
Except for one person

52:54.880 --> 52:58.880
There's nothing more in that for me to watch

52:58.880 --> 53:00.880
Okay, well as someone who doesn't watch the show

53:00.880 --> 53:02.880
I have no idea, so there you go

53:02.880 --> 53:04.880
Alright, Japanese release dates

53:04.880 --> 53:06.880
No More Heroes

53:06.880 --> 53:08.880
Is coming out on the Xbox 360

53:08.880 --> 53:10.880
And yeah, I heard about that

53:10.880 --> 53:12.880
That they were going to remake that for the 360

53:12.880 --> 53:14.880
Because mature games don't do very well on the Wii

53:14.880 --> 53:16.880
It's going to be awesome

53:16.880 --> 53:18.880
So there it is on its way on the 360 this week

53:18.880 --> 53:20.880
And there's lots of people like Loki

53:20.880 --> 53:22.880
Who will probably use his new JTAG

53:22.880 --> 53:24.880
Not creepy and ominously donated 360 to play

53:24.880 --> 53:26.880
It could be a bomb, I haven't opened it up yet

53:26.880 --> 53:28.880
Loki

53:28.880 --> 53:30.880
I'm going to get that screen somewhere

53:30.880 --> 53:32.880
Alright, on the Playstation 3

53:32.880 --> 53:34.880
Also gets a version of No More Heroes

53:34.880 --> 53:36.880
As well, it's a pretty dry week otherwise

53:36.880 --> 53:38.880
I guess that's kind of the anchor

53:38.880 --> 53:40.880
And there you go, you can import the PS3 version

53:40.880 --> 53:42.880
If you don't have a modded console

53:42.880 --> 53:44.880
That's true, because PS3 is region free

53:44.880 --> 53:46.880
Of course it's all going to be in Japanese

53:46.880 --> 53:48.880
But who cares

53:48.880 --> 53:50.880
Might be able to get through it anyway

53:50.880 --> 53:52.880
Nintendo Wii, not a thing this week

53:52.880 --> 53:54.880
You got to wait until the 22nd for really any new games

53:54.880 --> 53:56.880
Playstation 2

53:56.880 --> 53:58.880
Clover no Kunen no Alice comes out

53:58.880 --> 54:00.880
As well as Psycho Shogi

54:00.880 --> 54:02.880
Gekyashashi Special

54:02.880 --> 54:04.880
That's just a price reduction

54:04.880 --> 54:06.880
About the equivalent of 20 bucks in Japan

54:06.880 --> 54:08.880
So look for that, that's a gambling game though

54:08.880 --> 54:10.880
I mean really, do you guys import gambling games?

54:10.880 --> 54:12.880
I don't think you do

54:12.880 --> 54:14.880
On the Nintendo DS, Let's Science with Marie and Gully

54:14.880 --> 54:16.880
That's a big game coming out this week

54:16.880 --> 54:18.880
On the Nintendo DS

54:18.880 --> 54:20.880
I've never heard of this game

54:20.880 --> 54:22.880
Let's Science, is that like Science Mama?

54:22.880 --> 54:24.880
I don't know

54:24.880 --> 54:26.880
I know it has little equations in it

54:26.880 --> 54:28.880
And all this other stuff

54:28.880 --> 54:30.880
Dekitayo Mama

54:30.880 --> 54:32.880
Mitsugo no Kumasan

54:32.880 --> 54:34.880
Otoko no Koko

54:34.880 --> 54:36.880
That is not Cookie Mama, I thought it was

54:36.880 --> 54:38.880
Because I saw Mama in the title

54:38.880 --> 54:40.880
Otoko means boy

54:40.880 --> 54:42.880
It's like a boy's hero

54:42.880 --> 54:44.880
Here's a boy

54:44.880 --> 54:46.880
Like a child's playground or something

54:46.880 --> 54:48.880
Anyhow

54:48.880 --> 54:50.880
That's the DS

54:50.880 --> 54:52.880
Quickly looking at the PSP

54:52.880 --> 54:54.880
Sokoku no Kusabi

54:54.880 --> 54:56.880
Hiro no Kakara 3 comes out this week

54:56.880 --> 54:58.880
That is

54:58.880 --> 55:00.880
An action game

55:00.880 --> 55:02.880
I'm trying to see if this is an established franchise

55:02.880 --> 55:04.880
Because it's 3

55:04.880 --> 55:06.880
I don't recognize it

55:06.880 --> 55:08.880
It looks like it's based on an anime

55:08.880 --> 55:10.880
Because it has really pretty cut scene looking things in it

55:10.880 --> 55:12.880
A lot of talking and chatting in the game

55:12.880 --> 55:14.880
Can't tell what that is though

55:14.880 --> 55:16.880
Sorry, I'm not up to speed on all of my Japanese

55:16.880 --> 55:18.880
What is this?

55:18.880 --> 55:20.880
Maybe this is it

55:20.880 --> 55:22.880
There's a limited edition of it coming out as well

55:22.880 --> 55:24.880
I was trying to see if that would tell me what it is

55:24.880 --> 55:26.880
Nope

55:26.880 --> 55:28.880
Oh well

55:28.880 --> 55:30.880
That's coming out on the PSP

55:30.880 --> 55:32.880
And that's it for Japanese release dates

55:32.880 --> 55:34.880
Dark Sakura, how about

55:34.880 --> 55:36.880
Yeah, I just smacked the thing

55:36.880 --> 55:38.880
How about The Old Kingdom

55:38.880 --> 55:40.880
Well, on the 15th we have Final Fight Double Impact

55:40.880 --> 55:44.880
We have Sam & Max The Devil's Playground Episode 1

55:44.880 --> 55:46.880
The Penal Zone

55:46.880 --> 55:48.880
And on the 16th we have

55:48.880 --> 55:50.880
Samurai Shodown Sen

55:50.880 --> 55:52.880
Grand Theft Auto 4

55:52.880 --> 55:54.880
Episodes from Liberty City

55:54.880 --> 55:56.880
And Splinter Cell Conviction

55:56.880 --> 55:58.880
Just a few more stories for you guys

55:58.880 --> 56:00.880
Then we're going to get into the classic game of the week

56:00.880 --> 56:02.880
But first

56:02.880 --> 56:04.880
A few more news stories for you guys

56:04.880 --> 56:06.880
Loki

56:06.880 --> 56:08.880
Yes, of course with the new update

56:08.880 --> 56:10.880
3.21

56:10.880 --> 56:12.880
That removes

56:12.880 --> 56:14.880
Linux from the Playstation 3

56:14.880 --> 56:16.880
Which is retarded

56:16.880 --> 56:18.880
I'll just tell you right now

56:18.880 --> 56:20.880
Yeah, you weren't here last week

56:20.880 --> 56:22.880
I'm really curious about your thoughts on this whole thing

56:22.880 --> 56:24.880
But you know, both Dark Sakura and I were kind of just like

56:24.880 --> 56:26.880
Well, we haven't really used it

56:26.880 --> 56:28.880
I mean, Dark Sakura is a Linux fan

56:28.880 --> 56:30.880
So obviously she's disappointed

56:30.880 --> 56:32.880
I don't know, what do you think?

56:32.880 --> 56:34.880
Since Sonya made a big to-do about

56:34.880 --> 56:36.880
Trying to patch it up, I'm not updating my system

56:36.880 --> 56:38.880
Until I see what happens

56:38.880 --> 56:40.880
Don't you kind of have to?

56:40.880 --> 56:42.880
If you want to play anything online

56:42.880 --> 56:44.880
Because it does that whole thing where it says

56:44.880 --> 56:46.880
There is a system update available

56:46.880 --> 56:48.880
If you want to connect to Playstation Network for anything

56:48.880 --> 56:50.880
You have to upgrade

56:50.880 --> 56:52.880
I don't connect to Playstation Network

56:52.880 --> 56:54.880
Because I don't play anything on it

56:54.880 --> 56:56.880
Well then you'll be fine, I'm just saying

56:56.880 --> 56:58.880
I mean, even to like

56:58.880 --> 57:00.880
Have the online leaderboards or anything

57:00.880 --> 57:02.880
You can't play those without

57:02.880 --> 57:04.880
Updating

57:04.880 --> 57:06.880
Because my system wasn't updated

57:06.880 --> 57:08.880
I haven't played anything on Playstation 3 this week

57:08.880 --> 57:10.880
But I went into a game on there the other night

57:10.880 --> 57:12.880
Actually I was showing a friend our little cameo

57:12.880 --> 57:14.880
In the Namco Museum game

57:14.880 --> 57:16.880
But that game wants to connect for leaderboards

57:16.880 --> 57:18.880
And it was not working right

57:18.880 --> 57:20.880
Because it needed me to update

57:20.880 --> 57:22.880
That's when you unhook it from the internet

57:22.880 --> 57:24.880
I'm just saying, you're going to be very limited

57:24.880 --> 57:26.880
Until you update

57:26.880 --> 57:28.880
I'm okay

57:28.880 --> 57:30.880
Anyways, so what's important about this is

57:30.880 --> 57:32.880
Apparently the guy GeoHot

57:32.880 --> 57:34.880
Who has done different

57:34.880 --> 57:36.880
Hacks on the iPhone

57:36.880 --> 57:38.880
And whatnot

57:38.880 --> 57:40.880
He's one of the first guys

57:40.880 --> 57:42.880
Jail broke some of those I guess

57:42.880 --> 57:44.880
Anyways

57:44.880 --> 57:46.880
So he is

57:46.880 --> 57:48.880
He put out a video

57:48.880 --> 57:50.880
That shows him with the

57:50.880 --> 57:52.880
A modded 3.21

57:52.880 --> 57:54.880
System with actually

57:54.880 --> 57:56.880
The option to install the other OS

57:56.880 --> 57:58.880
Still, so basically

57:58.880 --> 58:00.880
He patched out their patch

58:00.880 --> 58:02.880
And just added the update or something

58:02.880 --> 58:04.880
And he says it's very easy to do

58:04.880 --> 58:06.880
But he also says that he's

58:06.880 --> 58:08.880
Not going to necessarily program anything

58:08.880 --> 58:10.880
So that people can

58:10.880 --> 58:12.880
Build like

58:12.880 --> 58:14.880
You know

58:14.880 --> 58:16.880
At least the pirate stuff

58:16.880 --> 58:18.880
But right now it's just doing it for the other operating system

58:18.880 --> 58:20.880
But that makes me wonder

58:20.880 --> 58:22.880
How long

58:22.880 --> 58:24.880
Because it's just a matter of time

58:24.880 --> 58:26.880
And in fact actually

58:26.880 --> 58:28.880
His quote basically

58:28.880 --> 58:30.880
He says

58:30.880 --> 58:32.880
Basically saying that because of this

58:32.880 --> 58:34.880
They've potentially turned

58:34.880 --> 58:36.880
100,000 plus legit

58:36.880 --> 58:38.880
Users into hackers

58:38.880 --> 58:40.880
Because now they're going to try to find

58:40.880 --> 58:42.880
They weren't caring before about trying to

58:42.880 --> 58:44.880
Break it to add Linux to it

58:44.880 --> 58:46.880
But now that they're removing it

58:46.880 --> 58:48.880
They're going to be more diligent in trying to

58:48.880 --> 58:50.880
Hack the PS3

58:50.880 --> 58:52.880
Well it also just seems like no surprise that

58:52.880 --> 58:54.880
You know this was cracked in minutes

58:54.880 --> 58:56.880
You know

58:56.880 --> 58:58.880
Is essentially what Sony did

58:58.880 --> 59:00.880
Is they just released something that didn't like

59:00.880 --> 59:02.880
Actually remove the feature

59:02.880 --> 59:04.880
But just like remove the menu item

59:04.880 --> 59:06.880
Or something you know

59:06.880 --> 59:08.880
It sounds like this hack was so

59:08.880 --> 59:10.880
Easy that this guy did

59:10.880 --> 59:12.880
Like Sony didn't really take it out

59:12.880 --> 59:14.880
They just took out your ability to access it

59:14.880 --> 59:16.880
Well the PS3 and the PSP

59:16.880 --> 59:18.880
For example their operating systems

59:18.880 --> 59:20.880
Are very similar especially the way

59:20.880 --> 59:22.880
Their patch files and stuff come over

59:22.880 --> 59:24.880
That you know if you're familiar with the PSP

59:24.880 --> 59:26.880
You're probably going to have an easy way

59:26.880 --> 59:28.880
Around the Playstation 3

59:28.880 --> 59:30.880
It's just there's certain things

59:30.880 --> 59:32.880
That they haven't figured out yet

59:32.880 --> 59:34.880
And apparently this guy has figured out ways

59:34.880 --> 59:36.880
Around it

59:36.880 --> 59:38.880
Now another kind of story that ties in with this

59:38.880 --> 59:40.880
Is apparently there was a guy

59:40.880 --> 59:42.880
A European PS3 owner who

59:42.880 --> 59:44.880
Received I guess

59:44.880 --> 59:46.880
A credit for

59:46.880 --> 59:48.880
You know about 84 pounds

59:48.880 --> 59:50.880
I guess

59:50.880 --> 59:52.880
From Amazon because

59:52.880 --> 59:54.880
He filed a complaint with the retailer

59:54.880 --> 59:56.880
Saying that the firmware update

59:56.880 --> 59:58.880
Violated some sort of

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880
European law

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.880
Basically saying that the console

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.880
No longer performed as advertised

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880
And you know and I do think that

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.880
Is something though I mean if you're putting

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.880
On the box or you had on the box

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.880
Right now they have all these slim systems and stuff

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.880
Just before you go there

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.880
In the US it's not on the box

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.880
I can't speak for the UK but I only know this

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.880
Cause last week on Bobby's show cause right before the call

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.880
He actually had the box and he said it's not on the box

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.880
Ok but still though

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.880
I don't know about the UK but this is the US

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.880
It was still a feature though that they advertised

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.880
And then I guess

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.880
But I guess you could say the same thing with

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.880
Playstation 2 backwards compatibility

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.880
It was something that you know

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.880
They removed from

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.880
Their new systems but it's not like

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.880
It was there on those systems

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.880
To begin with and then they took it out because

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.880
You know what hey we just don't want you to play

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.880
Playstation 2 games anymore

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.880
It's still no matter how insignificant

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.880
It is it still sucks

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.880
That they removed it because

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.880
I mean this is something

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.880
You may be paying for and granted it's not a feature

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.880
That I use but that'd be the same thing

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.880
If like oh well I don't really watch

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.880
Blu-ray movies on my you know PS3

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.880
And then they send a patch over that you know

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.880
Now prevents me from watching

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.880
Blu-ray movies

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.880
Granted it wasn't a feature I was using

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.880
It's still like you're removing a feature

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.880
Off the console

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.880
And yeah

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.880
People should be pissed because

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.880
Granted they're doing this for security reasons

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.880
But what if they

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.880
Find a way around you know

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.880
Something else

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.880
What other features are going to be removed

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.880
I don't know

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.880
It's just a case of a couple

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.880
Bad apples ruining the barrel I think

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.880
You know but I think it was a little silly for

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.880
You know I said this earlier but I think it was

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.880
Silly for Sony to put that feature in in the

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.880
First place

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.880
If they're closing it up because

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.880
Of piracy because Linux kind of lent itself

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.880
To piracy anyway and I'm not talking about PS3

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.880
Necessarily but everybody knew there was emulators

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.880
Out there for the NES and you know

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.880
But see now though with Linux

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.880
Installed on these systems they can sell you know

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.880
A ton of them to different like universities

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880
Or whatever using them as number crunchers

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.880
It's an easy way to make up some console

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.880
Sales you know just uh

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.880
Hey look you can run Linux on it it's like a little

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.880
Portable super computer you know they're even

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.880
Saying oh yeah it's you know it's

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.880
A computer system it's not a game system

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.880
It's a computer system

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.880
You know when of course the rumors

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.880
Were that they were doing that to evade taxes

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.880
Or whatever but uh

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.880
Still though now you're

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.880
I don't know

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.880
It's

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.880
They can do whatever they want I guess because

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.880
Since you know then user license agreement

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.880
Anyways just basically says you're leasing the

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.880
Console from them so

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.880
If they want to take features away I guess they can

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.880
But I you know

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.880
As a consumer I will

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.880
Probably think twice when it comes to the next

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.880
PlayStation system that they are

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.880
Advertising you know can do such

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.880
And such things you'll probably think twice

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.880
You know hey

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.880
Move later because it doesn't go their

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.880
Way

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.880
It is very interesting that they can just

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.880
Kind of do that I mean I'm and we

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.880
All accept that because it's in the

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.880
Agreements that we you know hit

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.880
A to get through real fast you know

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.880
Hun the Xbox

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.880
It just seems

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.880
I don't know

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.880
Well and also if you ever

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.880
Happen to click no then you just

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.880
Don't get to use it right? Exactly

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.880
I don't know it just seems

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.880
It's just kind of

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.880
Sad there's nothing to protect me

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.880
It would be different if it was just

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.880
Connecting to their online service and I

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.880
Understand yes they can prevent you from

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.880
Going to their online service for whatever

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.880
Reason if they want you to update and you don't want to

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.880
Then fine you can't connect to their online service

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.880
But you know

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.880
Offline games if you pop in a game or

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.880
Whatever it will just automatically patch your system

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.880
Up anyways you can't just say

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.880
No I don't want to install this patch

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.880
It's going to do it regardless

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.880
And they do it obviously as a security feature

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880
So that you know you can't go and hack

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.880
The Playstation 3 but

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.880
Whatever

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.880
Then maybe they should have figured out a way to be able to

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.880
Leave the operating system on there and not

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.880
Have it you know

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.880
Have access to whatever that's

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.880
On the Playstation 3 that you can apparently

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.880
Hack the system with

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.880
Alright

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.880
Well turning to something

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.880
That is an old

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.880
Standby and reliable and you know

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.880
These are always coming and not going to get taken away from you

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.880
Pokemon that's right

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.880
Taking a step over to the Nintendo systems

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.880
Pokemon obviously those

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.880
Other games the what was it

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.880
Gold and silver remakes were

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.880
Released not that long ago and they come with little

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.880
Trainers that were all over

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.880
PAX East well

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.880
The games were successful enough

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.880
Obviously I mean the Pokemon

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.880
Black and Pokemon White have been announced

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.880
Those are the newest games for the Pokemon

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.880
Series they are going to be

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.880
Coming out this fall in Japan for the

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.880
Nintendo DS that is

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.880
DS not the 3DS

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.880
So these are still games I mean obviously the 3DS

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.880
Will play them as we know about

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.880
The 3DS so far but these games are being

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.880
Developed for the DS

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.880
More info is supposed to come in the next few weeks but the game

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.880
Is supposed to be out in fall and I imagine we'll see some of this

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.880
At E3 as well even though

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.880
The logo design is gorgeous

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.880
Even though the games probably won't come out in America for some time

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.880
What is so gorgeous about the design for you?

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.880
I just like it I just really like it it's

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.880
Copping I have this thing for

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.880
Black and White

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.880
And just with the red Pokeball in the background I think it's

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.880
Actually really eye catching and really well done

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.880
It's very interesting that they decided

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.880
Just to go with Black and White

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.880
Like you know just very

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.880
Plain colors if you will

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.880
None of this like Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.880
Black and White

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.880
Honestly I think using

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.880
Black and White is

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.880
I always thought of just using

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.880
Black and White as being more classy

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.880
Than going for the

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.880
Sparkly poo

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.880
So a classier more refined Pokemon?

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.880
I think so I think that it takes a lot more talent

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.880
I mean I just

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.880
I prefer things being

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.880
You know pretty clean

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.880
In how they're you know done

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.880
Honestly I like the logo

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.880
The fact that I can actually look at it

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.880
And read it right away

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.880
I was kind of impressed with myself

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.880
Act F in our chat room says the third version

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.880
Is going to be gray

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.880
Make it easy huh?

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.880
Uh yep so more Pokemon

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.880
I'm just kind of surprised this information

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.880
Is coming out so soon after the release of the games

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.880
We just had here but at the same time

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.880
We have to remember

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.880
This news was tailored for Japan not really

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.880
For the US and those games have been out in Japan

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.880
For some time it's kind of like the news about the 3DS

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.880
Came out what like the day

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.880
That the DSIXL was released here

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.880
Interesting

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.880
We can only learn from like you know another

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.880
Company that has announced a revision

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.880
To their system

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.880
Right as they're launching their system

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.880
Hmm

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.880
That hasn't happened before has it?

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.880
Oh wait no it has

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.880
Yeah

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.880
Bochi Kawa in our chat room says classy Pokemon

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.880
A squirrel in a top hat with a cane

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.880
Possibly

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.880
And Frisbee in chat says there's my problem

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.880
I don't know if I should buy black or white

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.880
Or wait for

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.880
Gray since it's inevitable

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.880
There will be a third version as well

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.880
It's like they have this stuff down to a

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.880
Science now how to milk the most money out of you

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.880
Pokey fans

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.880
I don't know I guess I'll buy it if it's good

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.880
I'm tempted for some weird reason I can't even

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.880
Explain to buy that DS one just cause it seems

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.880
So freaking popular

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.880
But I'll just have to shake the walking trainer cause you know

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.880
See gray will come out

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.880
On the 3DS

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.880
Maybe you never know

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.880
Alright well let's stop talking about the new stuff

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:36.880
I'm gonna send it to pay some tribute to the old stuff

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.880
Every week here on the show

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.880
We like to take a look at gaming's past

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.880
And take a trip to the classic vault

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.880
And look at the classic video game

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.880
Of the week where Dark Soccer will pick one game

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.880
From the archives and she says you know what

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.880
You ungrateful kids

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.880
Playing with your Pokeymans all day and collecting your mudkips

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.880
You should take some time out

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.880
To pay tribute

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.880
To those that paved the way for these games

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.880
It's the classic game of the week Dark Soccer

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.880
For the kids tonight

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.880
The game I have chosen is Samurai Shodown 2

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.880
Samurai Shodown 2

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.880
I'm starting with the sequel

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.880
I love this series so much

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.880
The Japanese title is

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.880
Shin Samurai Spirits

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.880
Haomaru Jigokuen

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.880
So it translates to

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.880
True Samurai Spirits Haomaru's Portrait of Hell

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.880
It is a fighting game

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.880
It does the big in and out scrolling

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.880
Depending on how far everybody is across the screen

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.880
It also has a bunch of easter eggs in it

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.880
Which I think is absolutely fun

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.880
And has the pow meter

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.880
Ooh pow

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.880
I actually own this game

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.880
On Mio Geo

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.880
I have the cartridge

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.880
Well technically I have the Japanese cartridge

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.880
But you know you can actually switch

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.880
Your country of origin on it

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.880
And it changes your blood to sweat

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.880
And back and forth

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.880
Like this is from the Japanese version clearly

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.880
Cause there is blood everywhere

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.880
It's white sweat for the US one

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.880
But this one had

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.880
Some of the best characters in it

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.880
Actually like

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.880
I have to say three of my favorite characters

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.880
Came about in this game

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.880
Is uh

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.880
Kibagami Genjuro

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.880
Who was Haomaru's rival

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.880
Cham Cham who replaced Tam Tam

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.880
The little cat girl

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.880
And she was fun

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.880
She had like the giant boomerang

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.880
And I don't know that she has been in anything else

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.880
She was fantastic

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.880
We had Nihot Saiger

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.880
Who was the

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.880
Oppression knight with the huge mungus gauntlet

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.880
Another one I liked was

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.880
Kathy Nicotine

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.880
Who was this little monk

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.880
He was so fun

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.880
He could turn himself into a statue

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.880
Kuroko

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.880
Who was a hidden boss in the game

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.880
Who was actually the little guy that wears all black

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.880
That waves the flags

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.880
If anyone who doesn't really know

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.880
So much about

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.880
I would say

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.880
Japanese theater

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.880
Kuroko is like

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.880
A stage hand

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.880
The person who goes behind the scenes

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.880
Wears all black

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.880
He's supposed to be invisible

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.880
He'll be like a prop or something

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.880
Or change scenery

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.880
It's a cool music video

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.880
That uses all that

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.880
It's a sister sister's video

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.880
I can't remember what song it was

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.880
Except that he's not on a black screen

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.880
He's just a dude in black

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.880
Hanging out by the scenery

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.880
It's like what I would do in Rocky

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.880
Before I was the curtain

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.880
Right

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.880
Yeah, Rocky used to climb up on me

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.880
A couple of times

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.880
Let's not give the listeners the wrong impression

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.880
Of our friendship

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.880
No

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.880
There was also

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.880
A new

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.880
Female boss in the game

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.880
Um

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.880
Named

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.880
Rashojin Mizuki

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.880
Yeah, Amakusa was not female

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.880
Amakusa was just a girly dude

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.880
Um

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.880
You also

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.880
Had a blocking

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.880
And a parry technique

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.880
Um

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.880
Basically

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.880
You would, you know, push

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.880
Against sword to sword, you'd lock

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.880
And then whoever came across it

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.880
Could get in a hit that was unlockable

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.880
And they actually

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.880
Borrowed that for Street Fighter 3

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.880
Well, the kind of parry thing

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.880
The parry thing in Street Fighter 3 was different

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.880
Um

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.880
You, um

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.880
There were cameos from other SNK characters

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.880
And different stuff would happen

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.880
My favorite easter eggs though

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.880
A weird little move that you could do

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.880
With each of the characters

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.880
That would make them chibi

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.880
They'd just be little chibi, cutesy versions

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.880
They would just show up chibi

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.880
I did one by accident one time

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.880
And I was like, dude, that's kinda cool

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.880
Um

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.880
It actually, um

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.880
It was better received than the first one

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.880
And the first one, don't get me wrong, was great

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.880
But this one just took stuff that worked

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.880
And made it even better

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.880
It seriously, to me

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.880
It's one of my favorite games ever

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.880
It's up there, I'd put this up there

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.880
In the top ten, probably one of my favorite

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.880
Fighting games ever

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.880
Um

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.880
As far as versions that came out

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880
Um

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.880
It only came out on Neo Geo

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.880
For like the longest time

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.880
Um

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.880
And then there was the Neo Geo CD version

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.880
Came out for Windows

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880
And then

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:38.880
It actually, that version actually

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.880
Came out in the US

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.880
Um, there was a Playstation version that came out

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.880
In Samurai Spirit's Kenkaku Shinan Pack

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.880
Which, um, was the first two

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.880
And it only came out in Japan

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.880
And then the 2007 Tokyo Game Show

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.880
Um, there was an Xbox Live Arcade

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.880
And a PS2 Wii Anthology

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.880
Were announced

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.880
So

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.880
Um

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.880
It's

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.880
I, this is seriously

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.880
A fantastic game

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.880
It's one of, like I said, one of my favorites

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.880
And I think

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.880
Out of all of them, the only

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.880
Actually, no, I'd probably say that this one is my favorite

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.880
The only reason

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.880
That I would actually sometimes pick Samurai Spirit on three

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.880
Over two, sometimes

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.880
Is just to play as Rimuru

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.880
Cause she had the, um, the ice skin

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.880
Rimuru?

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.880
Bite Me Rob

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.880
That's her name, is Bite Me Rob

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.880
And then I'll go grab my cartridge in a second

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.880
That's it

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.880
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.880
Samurai Showdown 2

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.880
Not one, not three, two

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.880
But you'll probably see one and three

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.880
In future weeks

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.880
When Jamie starts running out of games

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.880
Cause you've been doing this a while now, gosh

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.880
This is probably, like, the 100th game of the week

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.880
Rob, you've seen The Vault

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.880
I know

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.880
I've got a couple thousand games in there

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.880
I'm not going to run out

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.880
Alright

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.880
Well, he's scraping the obscure if you really want to get to it

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.880
What are you going to do when you run out of Sega?

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.880
I don't think I'm going to run out of Sega

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.880
Alright, we'll see

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.880
Alright, anyhow

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.880
For now though, we're going to take a quick break

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.880
But we'll come back, there's still plenty more to talk about tonight

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.880
You know, we haven't even touched the big iPhone news this week

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.880
And yes, it does affect gaming

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.880
We're going to talk some Red Dead Redemption

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.880
Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.880
That's like Hammer Rimuru

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.880
And we're going to talk about

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.880
Some of the Microsoft changes to live

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.880
That are going to be kind of interesting

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.880
Especially for those of you that like to play games on the computer

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.880
Talk about a lot of that

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.880
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.880
So stick around, folks

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.880
We will be right back

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.880
And for those of you guys listening live tonight

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.880
On All Games Radio, we're going to take a quick music break

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.880
Stay tuned with us

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.880
Just a little bit of Poperia music tonight to listen to

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.880
We're going to be back in a few minutes

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.880
While we just take a second to rest our voices and so forth

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.880
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.880
We'll be right back

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.880
Welcome back everybody

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.880
To more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.880
On this Sunday night, April the 11th of 2010

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.880
We're joining you for our

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.880
362nd episode of the show

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.880
We're into Part B right now, the second half of our show

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.880
We have some rapid fire news coming up

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.880
And of course, Twitter topics

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.880
Just got a few more minutes to get those in

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.880
We already have quite a few though

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.880
If you want to ask us something on Twitter

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.880
And still some more news to get to

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.880
In tonight's program

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.880
Lots and lots of good stuff

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.880
Loki, why don't you kick it off with some rapid fire news

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.880
Yes, as it's been kind of a trend lately

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.880
There's been a lot of good games

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.880
Coming to the Xbox

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.880
Indie game service

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.880
And actually

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.880
Kind of not a stranger to

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.880
Doing some of these smaller

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.880
Indie games out there, Gameloft

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.880
They have decided to put a game on there called

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.880
Tank Battles

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.880
Actually it's pretty sweet

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.880
Kind of a high quality

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.880
Tank battling game

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.880
Almost like a souped up combat

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.880
If you will

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.880
And apparently it's kind of a port of

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.880
I want to say it's going to be a mobile game as well

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.880
And

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.880
Actually apparently it's been

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.880
Released last year on the Playstation

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.880
Network as Battle Tanks

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.880
Not sure why it hasn't been brought to

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.880
Xbox Live Arcade

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.880
Hey that's kind of cool anyways

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.880
How many of those games from the

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.880
Indie games have crossed over to regular

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.880
Xbox Live, hasn't there been like one?

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.880
Uh

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.880
Weren't they saying some time ago

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.880
That either there were going to be more that would cross over

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.880
To actual games or am I just

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.880
Making stuff up?

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.880
They do like a contest I want to say each year

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.880
And there's some that come out of that

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.880
But

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.880
Well no, they do a

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.880
Contest once a year

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.880
And they rarely port just one game from that

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.880
Um

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.880
But

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.880
I don't see a lot of them coming over the Xbox Live Arcade

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.880
But I don't really think it needs to because

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.880
Especially the ones that do win the

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.880
Contest they do get singled out

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.880
You can select I think

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.880
Contest winners or

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.880
Competition winners or whatever and you can actually see those

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.880
And then also of course now

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.880
With the new rating system and stuff

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.880
Um

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.880
It allows games that are actually pretty good

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.880
To make it to the forefront so people can sort through

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.880
All the hundreds of games that are on there

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.880
So um

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.880
It's not

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.880
Horrible, I don't know, it's getting better

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.880
That's for sure

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.880
Lots more games are coming out on there

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.880
Um

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.880
Now one game that we of course are not going to

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.880
Probably see on Indie games but

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.880
Perhaps an Xbox Live Arcade release

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.880
Or maybe something on the Playstation network

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.880
Who knows, um, Rocket Knight

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.880
Another game coming out

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.880
Of course you may remember Rocket Knight

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.880
I believe was an old Konami franchise

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.880
And um

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.880
Apparently this is going to be coming out soon

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.880
Um

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.880
Actually I believe in May

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.880
Which is pretty awesome

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.880
Not a series I can

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.880
Say I remember, maybe if I saw screenshots

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.880
It was um

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.880
I don't know if

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.880
It was like a 2D action game

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.880
And it will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.880
PlayStation Network and Steam

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.880
And it was um, originally a 16 bit game

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.880
I want to see what was on like the

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.880
Super Nintendo

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.880
I don't know

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.880
But uh, yeah I don't know if the screen should

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.880
It's kind of souped up looking

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.880
So obviously the screenshots probably don't

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.880
Bring back any memories of the original game

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.880
But uh, looks neat

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.880
Alright, so that'll be coming out

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.880
Um

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.880
And then finally

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.880
Another Xbox Live Arcade game

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.880
Uh

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.880
And also going to be coming on Steam as well

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.880
Uh, Serious Sam HD

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.880
The second encounter is of course

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.880
Getting its um

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.880
Brand new HD remake I guess

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.880
And uh, should be coming

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.880
To Xbox Live soon

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.880
Um

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.880
They haven't really made an official date yet for

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.880
Xbox Live Arcade, but the Steam version is

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.880
Supposed to be coming out around

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.880
April 28th

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.880
And of course the PC version

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.880
On Steam will be available for

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.880
$17.99

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.880
And uh, I guess that'll be

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.880
If you pre-order it, otherwise

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.880
It's going to be $20

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.880
No word on exactly what it's going to cost of course

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.880
On um

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.880
Xbox Live Arcade, but probably somewhere around that

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.880
I mean $15

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.880
By the way, Rama in our chat room is clarifying

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.880
Just in case you didn't know, Rocket Knight Adventures

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.880
Was on the Sega Genesis

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.880
And the sequel Sparkster was on the

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.880
Super Nintendo and Genesis

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.880
So Sparkster was the original sequel

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.880
There you go

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.880
Alright, um, I got some other rapid

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.880
Quick stories for you guys

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.880
Couple items around Rock Band

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.880
Of course the weekly Rock Band releases

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.880
The songs that are coming out on Rock Band this week

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.880
Either on the 13th or the 15th

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.880
Depending on what system you're on

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.880
The Used will be releasing

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.880
The songs Blood on My Hands, Born to Quit

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.880
And The Taste of Ink

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.880
And some individual tracks from Surge Tunkian

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.880
Empty Walls and Sky is Over

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.880
As well as All Star

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.880
By Smash Mouth

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.880
If you haven't heard that song

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.880
500 times in 1999

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.880
You can hear it all over again

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.880
Speaking of 90's terrific things

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.880
Green Day is coming out

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.880
Of course with their own version of Rock Band

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.880
I did take a look at it a little bit

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.880
At PAX East, I didn't get to play it

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.880
But I saw other people playing it

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.880
And it definitely looked like the Beatles engine

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.880
But now they've replaced the Beatles with

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.880
You know, the punk guys of Green Day

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.880
So, you know, and giving it its own little spice

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.880
Obviously, the songs that will be in the game

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.880
I'm not gonna name them all, but I will just say

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.880
It almost looks like most of the

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.880
Dookie album, American Idiot

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.880
And 21st Century

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.880
Breakdown, almost like all those

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.880
Albums seem to be there, I mean there are some tracks missing

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.880
But big, big components of those albums

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.880
Otherwise, from

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.880
Warning, there's Minority and Warning

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.880
Nimrod has Hitchin' a Ride, Good Riddance, Time of Your Life

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.880
You know, when you need that slow jam

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.880
That quintessential goodbye song

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.880
Nice Guys Finish Last, then Insomniac has

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.880
Brain Stew, Jaded, and Geek Stink Breath

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.880
Geek Stink Breath

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.880
Downloadable content includes 21

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.880
Guns, and so forth

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.880
A few songs there

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.880
And then lastly for you guys, Squeenix

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.880
Has some Final Fantasy XIV updates this week

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.880
Including some of the races and clan

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.880
Information

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:22.880
Basically, your races can boil down into these

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.880
Different clans, so

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.880
You can play one of the not-Galka

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.880
But they're actually called Rogadins now

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.880
You can actually be like a

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.880
Sea Wolf Fisherman type of

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.880
Galka, I keep on calling them Galkas

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.880
But I guess they're Rogadins now

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.880
Or you can be like a fire type

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.880
Hellsguard clan, so it's like all the

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.880
Races now have clans too

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.880
So you have like a specialized sort of

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.880
Place that your race comes from

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.880
Well I'm glad they actually changed something other than the names

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.880
Well here's the other big thing is that

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.880
Some more information came out that's out there on the internet

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.880
And your characters have like first and

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.880
Last names now

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.880
A lot of instances play into

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.880
The game apparently

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.880
Where you get a lot of your own copy of the world

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.880
Dude, the game is sounding more and more like

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.880
Final Fantasy XI meets not Warcraft

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.880
But Guild Wars

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.880
Like I seriously think the game that they're making

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.880
Is like Final Fantasy XIV Guild Wars

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.880
Okay, that sounds playable

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.880
Just make it so I don't have to pay an online fee

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.880
Like Guild Wars and I'm there

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.880
Sadly I don't think that part, but there's screens from the alpha

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.880
That are leaking out there now and you can see

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.880
I'll have to show you the website here in Studio Loki

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.880
And Jamie if you want to see it too

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.880
Because your items are on like

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.880
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, like you push the button

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.880
To do the attack now

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.880
Like it's a little more wow-ish

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.880
Or Guild Wars was kind of the same way

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.880
So very curious to see how this plays out

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.880
Well as long as I can do it with a controller

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.880
Because I kind of miss playing with a controller

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.880
Well if they're developing it for PS3

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.880
Then I'm sure controller will be

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.880
I mean but it'll be weird because I don't know if you'll be able to

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.880
Put in just any old controller or what you'll have to do

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.880
Break out the old gravis pad, do it the old school way

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.880
It should be fine

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.880
We'll see what happens, more to come

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.880
When the beta for that is released

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.880
But meanwhile we just have stuff leaking out from the alpha

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.880
So I'll show you, while Jamie does her quick stories here

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.880
I'll pull up that website

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.880
That somebody texted me here in Studio

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.880
And show you guys the screenshots

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.880
And I'll post it in chat if anyone actually cares

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.880
Well some kid

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:18.880
Who is on Facebook

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.880
Plays Farmville

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.880
And used

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.880
Their parent's

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.880
Credit card to run up a

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.880
905 pound tab

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.880
Basically

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.880
About $13-1400

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.880
To

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.880
Pay for stuff

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.880
I guess he took his

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.880
Mother's credit card and put it in

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.880
And

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.880
Spent all that money

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.880
So they're trying to figure something out on it

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:48.880
I guess, I just think

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.880
I hate Farmville anyway

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.880
It's a waste of time

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.880
I know people like it, they want to do it fine

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.880
But if you got kids that play it, watch out for your

01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.880
Credit card

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.880
Can I just interject something real quick

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.880
I know you don't watch a lot of TV

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.880
But this week South Park was awesome

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.880
Because they made fun of

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.880
Oh here's the screenshots of 14 by the way

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.880
You can kind of see with the little stuff at the bottom

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.880
Yeah it's very pretty looking

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.880
The Vulture 8 is dead ass up

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.880
You can see there

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.880
Just some people running around the world

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.880
It looks very pretty

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.880
South Park did a Facebook

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.880
Related episode this week and it was hilarious

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.880
But it was Facebook

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.880
For the first half and then it was Tron for the second half

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.880
Yeah I need to watch that one

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.880
It was pretty fucking funny I gotta say

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.880
So was it Face Tron?

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.880
Well it was one of those things where I gotta be honest

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.880
A lot of episodes of South Park have been like this lately

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.880
The first 15 minutes are

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.880
Really fucking funny when they're parodying

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.880
Something and they're doing it well

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.880
And then they decide to go this really like

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.880
ETF lol BBQ direction

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.880
For the last 15 minutes

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.880
That doesn't work so much

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.880
Like that's been kind of a pattern of South Park lately

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.880
Like the first 15 minutes are hilarious

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.880
And the second 15 minutes are not nearly as funny

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.880
And that's kind of sadly the Tron part

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.880
Not as funny as the rest of it

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.880
But I thought it was awesome they referenced it

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.880
I love Tron though

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.880
Namco Bandai is doing something really

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.880
Neat

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.880
We're getting Splatterhouse on

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880
I guess they're doing

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.880
They're doing a new game

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.880
They got delayed and delayed

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.880
I was saying that

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.880
Sorry

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.880
Okay

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.880
As I was trying to say

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.880
They're doing a new Splatterhouse

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.880
And they're gonna put the original

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.880
Trilogy on

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.880
The disc

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.880
I guess this is a little fun compilation

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.880
To add on to that

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.880
It will have the original

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.880
Arcade version of Splatterhouse

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.880
As in the uncensored one

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.880
And then Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.880
That were the Genesis versions

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.880
So

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.880
That'll be pretty fun

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.880
Was this Herpographics one censored as well?

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.880
Cause I remember that being pretty

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.880
I have it but I haven't

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.880
Played it in so long that

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.880
I'd have to break it out and see

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.880
I don't recall it

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.880
Really being that censored

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.880
Really

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.880
And then

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.880
And then we have

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.880
For Xbox Live in April

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.880
Final Fight and Mega Man 10

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.880
Download Content

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:20.880
Basically

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.880
It's Final Fight Double Impact

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.880
And

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.880
That's gonna be on April 14th

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.880
And then

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.880
There will be

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.880
The Mall half-priced

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.880
On April 12th

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.880
And then two add-ons for Mega Man 10

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.880
Which is Base and Special Stage 1

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.880
Also known as Forte

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.880
Final Fight Double Impact

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.880
Next week

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.880
Or as I call it, Magic Sword

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.880
And some other little game

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.880
That I remember from a pizza parlor

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.880
I know I'm excited

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.880
There was no Xbox Live Arcade release this week

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.880
I don't think there was

01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.880
And they tend to do that after their big huge

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.880
Promotions, then they go

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.880
Oh we just had this awesome promotion

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.880
And some old games on sale

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.880
But we just want to overlook that we have no new game this week

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.880
There's no new game this week

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.880
Because they're too busy shutting down

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.880
Xbox service

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.880
On April 15th

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.880
It's gone, it's out there

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.880
So get your taxes done

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.880
And get your last Halo 2 game in

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.880
Unless you're gonna play on PC from here on out

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.880
I hope we get a patch so we get our 100 plus friends now

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.880
It's weird though

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.880
Because they already had the big patch

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:30.880
For the USB support

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.880
This past week

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.880
I don't know if you heard

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.880
We were talking about it, I don't think we are

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.880
But you heard that uncrippled the hard drive

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.880
Set of consoles that got banned

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:42.880
Oh?

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.880
Yes, that patch did

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.880
Interesting, yeah I think that is interesting

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.880
Alright, I wanted to quickly

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.880
Answer some questions from chat

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:52.880
chat.orangewiseontraday.com

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.880
Frisbee's asking in reference to the South Park episode

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.880
What did you think about the chat roulette part?

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.880
Oh I forgot that they make chat roulette

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.880
I didn't even realize that was a real site

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.880
I actually had the check that I was like, holy crap that's a real site

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.880
The only way that I know that's a real site

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.880
Is that I've seen the YouTube of the guy

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.880
Well I've seen a couple YouTubes

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.880
The guy that does the piano

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.880
And starts singing the random songs

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:14.880
To the guys that come up on there

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.880
Which is really funny

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.880
And then there was a guy who dressed up like Lady Gaga

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.880
And did lip syncs

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.880
But he was like a really hairy guy

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.880
So it was really funny because it was obviously not a woman

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.880
And just all the people reacting to him

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.880
Was kind of funny

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.880
But yeah, you're not gonna catch me

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.880
I will die before I will go on chat roulette

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.880
Like I've never been to the website

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.880
Penis, penis, penis, penis

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.880
I thought it was funny but it was kind of one of those things

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.880
Where the joke got old

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.880
And then they kept saying it like over and over again

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.880
For like another three minutes

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.880
And I was like, okay, I'm over it

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.880
But yeah, chat roulette, not a site

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.880
I mean god, I'm barely on AIM and Skype

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.880
Why would I go on chat roulette and talk to strangers

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.880
I can't even talk to my friends online

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.880
I'm not gonna go on chat roulette

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.880
Alright let's get to some Twitter topics

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.880
Every week we let you guys ask questions on Twitter

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.880
It seems like every podcast does this now

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.880
I don't know, like I've been listening to more podcasts

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.880
Everybody has a damn Twitter segment now

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.880
I'd like to think we were one of the first

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.880
It's like we were one of the first Skype shows

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.880
But whatever

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.880
It's awesome because it's our listeners

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:18.880
And they ask some crazy asked questions sometimes

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.880
And share some stories with us

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:22.880
That we might otherwise miss on the show

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.880
That's the other very important thing

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:26.880
Retertainment asks, games to play while drunk

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.880
Games to play while drunk

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.880
And go

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.880
I'd play DDR drunk

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.880
Rock band if Jamie's party yesterday

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.880
Was any indication

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.880
I wasn't really drunk

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.880
You weren't drunk

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:42.880
Yeah any type of karaoke game

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.880
Is always funnier when drunk

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.880
Why are you aware of the Wii

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.880
I think a lot of Wii games

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.880
Are kind of funnier when you're drunk

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.880
But just be careful

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.880
There's a difference between funny and hurting yourself

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.880
That goddamn unicorn game

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.880
That Loki always fucking plays during the show

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:00.880
I'm sure is better when you're drunk

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.880
He's playing right now

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.880
Robot unicorn attack, there you go

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.880
Agdeft says Konami is distributing

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.880
Latin American made game

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.880
Lucha Libre AAA Heroes Del Ring

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.880
In America

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.880
Ironically it's not coming out in Mexico

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.880
I don't know, maybe another developer is putting it out there

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.880
I don't know, but if you like your

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.880
Mexican wrestling, which it is kind of a niche thing

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.880
But it's pretty cool

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.880
Yeah and it's actual stars of AAA wrestling

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.880
El Eligido

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.880
Abismo Negro Psycho Clown

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.880
Electroshock, and Charlie Manson

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.880
There's a wrestler named Charlie Manson

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.880
That's a little close to a certain

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.880
Serial killer

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.880
So there you go

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:44.880
You might remember Konami

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.880
This isn't the first time they put out wrestling games

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.880
Oh no, they had Rumble Roses

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.880
Remember Rumble Roses?

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.880
What's your favorite Xbox game?

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.880
I wanted to play that actually, it's a game that Dan would never pick up

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.880
But I really wanted to play it

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:58.880
You could probably get it now for like $3

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.880
I think I saw Dead or Alive Volleyball

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.880
Or whatever for like $10 the other day

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.880
Hey, that was fun

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.880
There's a game to play when drunk

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.880
We've got to

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.880
And yes, I've watched Dan play it while I was drunk

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.880
Portal Drunk, instant throw up

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.880
SSJ100Matt on his Twitter account says

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.880
Not so much a story, but a question for Loki

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.880
Are you paying attention Loki?

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.880
He's playing the unicorn farting game

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.880
Well he just crashed the unicorn, so here we go

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:24.880
What's your opinion on the kid that was caught

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.880
Trying to steal the game Breach at PAX East?

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.880
Well it was a good attempt I guess

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:30.880
But he got caught

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.880
Don't compliment him

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.880
Nice try kid

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.880
He doesn't deserve a compliment

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.880
It was a stupid asshole thing to do

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.880
Yeah, well his reasons were retarded

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.880
It's like, I just want to play this with my friend

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.880
Well

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.880
No, you wanted to brag that you had the game

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.880
Is what you wanted to do

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.880
And unfortunately you're stupid and you got caught

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.880
So now you're going to face fines and jail time

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.880
And all that stuff

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.880
Hope it was worth it

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.880
I'm going to say he probably shouldn't have done it in the first place

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.880
Just taking a lucky stab in the dark

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.880
Well he shouldn't have, but you know

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.880
He wanted to make a name for himself

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:06.880
It's kind of surprising that he had the balls to do it

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.880
And then not show up to his court date

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.880
That was pretty fun

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.880
Hilarious

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.880
He was too busy playing on Chat Roulette

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.880
No, he was playing Modern Warfare 2

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.880
Was he really?

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.880
Spazinator, a PSN on Twitter

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.880
Actually tells us

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.880
Samurai Shodown 2 was also on Xbox Live Arcade

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.880
It was released there last year

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.880
That's right

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.880
I don't remember if Jamie said it

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.880
Sometimes people tweet us while she's doing that

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.880
Yeah, I remember

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.880
I played it for a little bit, but I got to admit

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.880
I was not as big on Samurai Shodown

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.880
I was talking about Samurai Shodown 2

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.880
The one that was released on Xbox Live Arcade

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.880
But that was not the series

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.880
I was really as into on Neo Geo

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.880
I was more of a Fatal Fury person

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.880
I have Fatal Fury Special

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:54.880
Then after that

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.880
I would go with Art of Fighting

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.880
Then maybe Samurai Shodown

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.880
Because I like Katori Hanzo

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.880
ActDeft says DJ Hero's price

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.880
is now down to $50 at Toys R Us

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.880
and links us to a new story about the price reduction

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.880
Not surprised

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:10.880
That didn't move as well as they did

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.880
Now would be a good time to pick that up

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.880
for DJ Hero 2

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.880
If you want to get the controller

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.880
and have it for DJ Hero 2

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.880
They also have, if you really want to spend the money

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.880
They have these new bundles now that have two

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.880
DJ Hero controllers with the game

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.880
It's a good game

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:28.880
It's a bummer they didn't support the download content better

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.880
Because they could have done better

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.880
I'll pick up the sequel

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.880
Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome game

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.880
It's just typical

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.880
of Activision and their support

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.880
for the download content

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.880
If you've seen what they do for the Guitar Hero series

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.880
It's not a big surprise that we only have

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.880
three pieces of download content

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.880
Dark Tetsuya says

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.880
I just realized we haven't heard from the ferret in a while

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.880
What ever happened to him?

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.880
When we moved the show to Studio Dark Sakura

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.880
The ferret didn't really come with us

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.880
I found it while moving

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.880
So the ferret is at my place right now

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.880
Don't forget we have other mascots here

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.880
We have that stupid Dalek

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.880
That I don't think is funny at all

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.880
We also have Shirmi

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.880
Who makes a pretty awesome mascot

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.880
Remember, Shirmi shit on the floor

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.880
When we were talking about that PlayStation show The Tester

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:16.880
Well good, I'm glad

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.880
But that was her opinion, she was critiquing

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:20.880
Wait wait wait

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:28.880
Ferret was, oh god my ears

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.880
Ferret was better

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.880
Ferret or Dalek?

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.880
I say ferret

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:36.880
Ray Ayanami says

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.880
No I'm sorry I skipped one

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.880
Spaznator also sent, usually I don't do two tweets

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.880
But I will allow it tonight

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.880
Rob you asked about a month ago if I seen The Tester

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.880
Finally seen it, I have similar thoughts on it

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.880
You know I stopped watching it

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.880
I heard it ended finally

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.880
And I'm pretty sure

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.880
Season 1 ended

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.880
Oh god are they doing another one?

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.880
Well anyhow I'm pretty sure the person I thought

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:00.880
Was gonna win won

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.880
You know I would go on season 2 of The Tester

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.880
Why not?

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.880
I mean they probably tape it over a weekend

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.880
And you get $5,000 for winning

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.880
I mean I probably wouldn't keep the job

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.880
But I'd like to have the $5,000

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.880
That'd be pretty awesome

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.880
It might be a fame whore, why not?

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.880
That even won The Tester, what do you think?

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.880
Go Xbox

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:22.880
I don't know, I quit

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.880
Might be fun for the experience

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.880
It sucks, I don't wanna play Ipet

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.880
Alright Ray Ayanami says

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.880
Oh whoops that was a personal tweet here

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.880
Just it had at o-l-r in it here

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.880
Shadow Sniper says your thoughts on Hitman 5

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.880
And what you would like to see in the new game

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:38.880
There's a Hitman 5?

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.880
I didn't even know there was a Hitman 5 coming out

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.880
I didn't play Hitman 1 through 4

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.880
It's not really my type of game, Loki that's more of your alley

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.880
No, it's a stealth

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.880
Action game so that's not really

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.880
My forte

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.880
What would I like to see in the new game? Lots of sex and violence

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.880
That always makes for a great video game, right?

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.880
Not Timothy Orphan, whatever his name is

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.880
Yes and more lesbians

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.880
Tigerclaw305

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.880
Tweet says

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.880
GTA is being shown to school children to teach them

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:06.880
About violence and links us to this

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.880
News story here from vg247.com

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.880
That

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.880
Apparently great school children

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:14.880
Are shown imagery from Grand Theft Auto

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.880
It's in the UK

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.880
And they're showing it to children between 9 and 11

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.880
And they're trying to keep them from being

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.880
Desensitized to violent behavior

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.880
And teach them consequences

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.880
By the way they also show them

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.880
The Itchy and Scratchy show from the Simpsons

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.880
What?

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.880
Like I had to check to make sure this wasn't dated April 1st

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.880
What?

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.880
Fight, and fight, and fight, and fight, and fight

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.880
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.880
Just a guess but

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.880
I don't think you show people violence to get them

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.880
Not desensitized to violence

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.880
That kind of

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.880
Is, you know, the opposite of what you want to do

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.880
You know what they did when I was young to scare the shit out of me

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.880
And this wasn't necessarily about violence

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.880
But it was violent

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.880
And it was about the responsibility of having a driver's license

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.880
Is they'd show us red asphalt

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.880
Oh we laughed through that

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.880
That's, you're not supposed to laugh

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:04.880
It's disgusting

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.880
I actually don't think I've ever seen red asphalt

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.880
I would like not watch it

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.880
Like I just would kind of look away and not really watch it

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.880
It was disgusting

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.880
Remember that every 15 minutes, you know, they'll teach you about drunk driving

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.880
I'm like, you're wasting so much time

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.880
I don't care

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.880
I get it

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.880
This person had alcohol

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.880
This is a drunk driving accident

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.880
It's sad, it happens

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.880
Why do I have to sit here for two hours while you talk about it?

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.880
They didn't do that at my school

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.880
Did they actually drink?

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.880
No they didn't, here's what they did

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.880
This is great

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.880
And this is from how I understand that they did it

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.880
It could be a little different

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.880
Okay, first they came out on our

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.880
You know, our football field

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.880
Because we had our stadium and whatever

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.880
They had everybody sit there and they had this

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.880
Big thing covered up with a tarp or something

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.880
So they pulled the tarp off

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:54.880
And it's this horrible car accident

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.880
Like this person mangled or whatever

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.880
Of course it's just a person with makeup on and whatnot

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.880
And then an ambulance comes

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.880
And they realistically

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.880
Pull them out of the wreckage and stuff like that

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.880
And then

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.880
Later on

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.880
Was it like one of the students?

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.880
Yeah, it was one of the students

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.880
It was somebody, animal

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.880
And then later on they had this grim reaper

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.880
Walking around the entire day

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.880
And in 15 minutes they would take a student

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.880
And pull them out of class

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:24.880
And they were basically dead

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.880
And they wouldn't be there for the rest of the week

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.880
Or however long it was

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.880
You had to get out of school for a week?

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.880
Okay, but no

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:34.880
It's like punishment basically

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.880
And I don't know if

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:38.880
Wait, punishment?

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.880
What did you do to get the grim reaper to tap you?

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:42.880
Oh, Matt didn't do his homework, you come with me

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.880
Kid

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:46.880
You're a drunk driver

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.880
This is entirely accurate because

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:50.880
It's really fucked up if it is

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.880
Um, basically they took

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.880
Them to like some sort of location

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.880
A cabin or whatever

01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.880
And made them write notes to their parents or something like that

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:00.880
About like

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.880
Dear mom, I am dead

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.880
I died at school today

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.880
Hello dad, I'm in hell!

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.880
Basically they said that they told their parents that they died

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.880
Or something like that

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.880
That's a horrible thing to do to your parents

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.880
Can you imagine if I wrote

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.880
I had to write a letter to my mom

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.880
Hi mom, I died at school today

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.880
The grim reaper took me out of class because I drank a drug

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.880
They didn't

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.880
They wrote letters to their parents later on

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.880
About stuff like that

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:28.880
Apparently the impression I was under

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:30.880
Is that the

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.880
The police went to their house

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.880
And told their parents that they were dead

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.880
You know

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.880
Shouldn't they be out trying to catch

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.880
Real drunk drivers?

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.880
Anyways, you know what they did at my school?

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.880
They would have the really mean, fugly PE teacher

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.880
Come in and say

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.880
If you drink and drive

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.880
You're gonna go to jail

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:52.880
And you're gonna stay there forever

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.880
And you're gonna have a criminal record

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.880
And if you drink and drive, you're an idiot

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.880
It took five minutes

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:00.880
I understand that and that makes perfect sense

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.880
Not only did we have to sit through this two hour long

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.880
You know

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.880
Accident thing

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.880
And them talking about

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.880
Every fifteen minutes and stuff

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.880
For another assembly

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.880
Where these people were crying

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.880
Their parents were crying, I thought Billy was dead

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.880
And all this stuff

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.880
It was annoying

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.880
So that's why I've learned about drunk driving

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.880
Is that it's absolutely annoying

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:26.880
The crap you have to deal with if you do it

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.880
So, don't do it

01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:30.880
Because you'll get two assemblies that you'll have to sit through

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:36.880
No, but honestly though

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.880
I mean, duh

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.880
Drunk driving impairs you and you can die

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.880
Okay, or kill somebody

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.880
I mean, any sane person

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.880
That has some sort of common sense

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:48.880
Gets that

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.880
However, nowadays, kids are not being raised with common sense

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.880
So, it's no wonder that they have to have

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.880
Multiple assemblies

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.880
In order for this to sink in

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.880
And even then, it's just not going to

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.880
Well that's okay, I'm just gonna

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:02.880
Smoke pot instead

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.880
That's better

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.880
I'm not drinking and driving at all

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.880
Fuck you, Grim Reaper

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.880
What were we talking about before?

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.880
I don't remember

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.880
I was trying to see if they had that clip

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.880
That I remember from the 90s

01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.880
That was, uh

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.880
Yeah, I think it's this

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:24.880
This was very much like what they did at my school

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.880
I think it's this clip

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.880
So, Beavis and Butthead

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.880
I understand Mr. McVicar has made

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.880
A little arrangement with you guys

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.880
Yeah, a little probation

01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.880
You see, class Beavis and Butthead

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.880
Here are not allowed to laugh

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.880
For a whole week

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.880
That's right, and if they do laugh

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.880
They'll be expelled and they'll have to

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.880
Go to Hope High School where they'll get

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.880
Their asses kicked on a daily basis

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.880
By all the other delinquents

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.880
Yeah, okay, so

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.880
Well, I was real glad to hear that

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.880
Because this is Sex Education Week

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.880
Oh, here we go

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.880
That's right, Sex Ed Week

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.880
We're gonna be talking about the penis

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.880
We'll be talking about

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.880
The vagina

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.880
Do you think that's funny, Butthead?

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.880
Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.880
About the testicles?

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.880
Yes, we're also gonna be talking

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.880
About venereal disease

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.880
Sexual intercourse

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.880
And we will definitely

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.880
Be spending a lot of time

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.880
Talking about masturbation

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:26.880
Laughing

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.880
Laughing

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.880
That's what they did at my school

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.880
See, this is the type of letter

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.880
Actually, that they had to write

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.880
For the every 15 minutes program

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.880
Dear Mom and Dad, every 15 minutes someone dies

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.880
As a result of an alcohol related collision

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.880
Today I died and I never got the chance

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:44.880
To tell you blah blah blah

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.880
And that's what made them all upset

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.880
It was annoying, trust me

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.880
If you go through high school

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:52.880
Just get the gym teacher in there for five minutes

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:54.880
Scare the hell out of everyone

01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.880
Do you want to see me again?

01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:58.880
Do you want to see me again?

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.880
We have some other tweets

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:02.880
MNZeba

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:04.880
Follows that with a question about Pokemon

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.880
RO

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.880
Plugging the old

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.880
Pokemon RO telling us

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.880
That you can actually win a beta account

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.880
Apparently they're doing a little thing there

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.880
But the thing they linked us to didn't work

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:18.880
But here's my thing

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.880
For some reason the link didn't work

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.880
But here's my question about Pokemon RO

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:24.880
Didn't one of these Pokemon operations get shut down recently?

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.880
Like there was a Pokemon MMO going on?

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.880
Like I'm just saying

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:30.880
I hope it doesn't get shut down

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.880
I wouldn't like to see that happen to this

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.880
But I'm just saying if Nintendo did the other one

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:36.880
Just be careful kids

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.880
I've seen some of the in-game stuff

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.880
That looks pretty

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.880
Ragnarok-y, pretty good

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.880
Alright anyhow

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.880
That's it for Twitter topics tonight

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.880
Thank you guys so much for the tweets

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:50.880
And sorry I didn't get to everything

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:52.880
Well we had to play the clip from Beavis and Butthead

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.880
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us in the future

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.880
Alright Giovedea in our chatroom says

01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:58.880
I took a college class where we had to yell

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:00.880
tits, ass, penis, vagina, and all that

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:02.880
on the first day of class

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.880
Sex education in college is actually a lot of fun

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:06.880
And it's educational

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.880
So those of you kids that are about the college age

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.880
Just take it, it's fun

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.880
We actually had in our class

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.880
They brought a transsexual

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.880
person in one day

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.880
Not a transvestite

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:20.880
We actually had to learn the difference

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.880
Transvestite is someone who just dresses

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.880
for fun and you know for

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:26.880
whatever

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:28.880
And a transsexual is someone who believes they are

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.880
the other gender

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:32.880
and is the ones that actually get the operations

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:34.880
So they had a transsexual come in

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:36.880
Teacher shut the door and said, okay for the next hour you can ask

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.880
anything you want and this person has agreed to

01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.880
answer any gross

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:42.880
curiosity, whatever you've ever wanted to know

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.880
now's time to ask it

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.880
So they asked everything

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.880
Everything

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:50.880
But it was a highly educational day, I'll tell you that

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.880
Our 6th

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.880
grade sex ed

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.880
was hilarious because they didn't really have

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.880
We had a female teacher so the female teacher

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.880
took the girls and explained the girls stuff

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:02.880
And then apparently

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.880
some kid's father

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:06.880
was the person we had

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.880
teaching the male portion of it and the guy

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.880
was a pervert

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.880
And that was funny

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:14.880
Yeah they used to split up the class for us too

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.880
And then the teacher found out

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.880
the guy was a pervert

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.880
And that was the end of sex ed

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.880
You guys might find this

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.880
funny but when I was in sex ed

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:26.880
You know what test I did

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:28.880
We had like 6 different tests throughout class

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:30.880
Do you know which test I got the lowest score on?

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:32.880
Out of all the tests that they gave out in class?

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:34.880
Male anatomy? No

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:36.880
Vagina week

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:38.880
You'd find that funny

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.880
I thought y'all would get a kick out of that

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.880
I find that ironic

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.880
Hey gaming

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.880
news once in a while

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.880
It happens

01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:50.880
believe it or not we talk about

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:52.880
video game news on this program

01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:54.880
Oh god what happened to this show

01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:56.880
Loki?

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.880
So what's kind of neat is there's a rumor

01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.880
that Microsoft's live support

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:02.880
is coming to the free games that you get

01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:04.880
with Windows. Yes you may remember

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.880
all those wonderful classics as

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:08.880
Solitaire, Minesweeper,

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.880
Chess, etc. Some of these

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:12.880
I have never heard of I guess because I don't have

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.880
Windows 7 like Purple Place

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:16.880
Purple Place! Yeah it's one of the new

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.880
Windows 7 games

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.880
And Windows has Mahjong now?

01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.880
Yep

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.880
It's on Vista

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:26.880
It's on Vista and 7

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.880
It's basically the old Shanghai game but

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:30.880
you know now Microsoft brand

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.880
So I wonder if

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.880
that means

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.880
apparently they're gonna not only get achievements

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.880
but chat and leaderboard support

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.880
So now I can chat with people

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.880
while playing Solitaire and have leaderboards

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:46.880
Wow

01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:48.880
Interesting that they're gonna integrate this

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:50.880
Well you know Solitaire is a huge game

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.880
on Windows I mean it's probably the number

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.880
one Windows game above

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:56.880
anything else you can think of

01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:58.880
WoW, Halo

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.880
anything you can think of

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:02.880
Solitaire is probably a bigger game then

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.880
Yeah

01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:06.880
So I mean if you want to and probably Minesweeper

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:08.880
to some extent too so if you want to enable people

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.880
so to speak or get them on board early

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:12.880
I suppose this is the way to do it

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.880
It just seems, I don't know, a little weird

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.880
But that's gonna be kind of interesting if I can

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.880
further inflate my E-peen

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.880
score with the

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.880
you know

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:24.880
Should have been working now, achievement

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.880
Played Solitaire between

01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:30.880
the hours of 8am and 5pm, achievement

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.880
unlocked

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.880
Anyhow

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.880
Microsoft of course isn't the only one

01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:38.880
that has a gaming network that is continuing

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.880
to grow and develop but another

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:42.880
big company is launching their own game network

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.880
It's Apple, that's right

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.880
One of the big things that was announced as part of the new

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.880
iPhone 4.0 OS

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:50.880
is Game Center

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:52.880
Game Center is going to be a single

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.880
online gaming experience

01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:56.880
for the Apple devices

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.880
that will kind of link all these games together

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.880
You'll be able to invite and track friends

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:02.880
You'll have matchmaking with this, leaderboards

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:04.880
and achievements, that's right

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.880
it's very own achievements

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.880
What's kind of interesting about this

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.880
is that systems like this already exist

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.880
somewhat in Apple's world

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.880
I don't know if any of you guys grabbed the

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.880
Commodore 64 emulator

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:18.880
that's available on the Apple, it was free a couple

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.880
days ago, I think just for like last

01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.880
weekend, so I grabbed it

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.880
It uses a technology called OpenFaint

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:26.880
which I believe is by the people who made Aurora

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.880
faint, which was one of the

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.880
very early early iPhone games that was

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.880
out there, that was the same type of thing

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.880
Somebody to develop like this platform

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.880
Well what happened is that now you have

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.880
OpenFaint and you have these other competing

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:40.880
platforms as well, and so

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.880
Apple has finally just decided to step in and say

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.880
you know what, actually, I think

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:46.880
we're going to do our own thing

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:48.880
Not just to steal a good idea

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:50.880
but I think to kind of

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.880
they probably see what's happening with the developers

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.880
and that more and more game developers want to be on OpenFaint

01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:56.880
or something like this, so Apple probably just

01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:58.880
wants to standardize it across the board

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:00.880
and have ownership of it

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.880
It affects their branding

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:04.880
I think, so

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.880
Yeah, and as much as you want to kind of say

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:08.880
they're big and evil for wanting to basically

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.880
shut down OpenFaint, well they're not really shutting down

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.880
OpenFaint, but they're really

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.880
trying to render it irrelevant, although

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.880
I'm sure OpenFaint will still be around for some things

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:18.880
I think Apple is very

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.880
big on consistency

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:22.880
Hence why they have such a rigid review

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.880
thing for apps

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:26.880
You know, there's a reason why your apps

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:28.880
all kind of look and feel the same

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:30.880
It's because it's not like you get to make

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.880
whatever buttons you want

01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:34.880
There are limitations to what you get to do with apps

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:36.880
And I think it's to give consistency

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.880
And so I think Apple

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:40.880
wants to take kind of reign of this

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.880
to bring that same consistency because it works well

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:44.880
for them

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.880
But of course there's always that controversy

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:48.880
because they don't really publish a lot of those guidelines

01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.880
on what exactly they look for when they screen things

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:52.880
Yeah

01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.880
By the way, some other things that were announced that will affect

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.880
gamers on the iPhone, I mean obviously

01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:58.880
there's multitasking was the big thing, although

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.880
I got a 3G, so I'm

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.880
screwed on that one, I'm not gonna get that

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.880
Hopefully they announce a new iPhone in June

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.880
because I'm eligible for an upgrade in October

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.880
It works for the 3GS

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:10.880
It will work for the 3GS, but I wanna

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:12.880
I know Apple, there will be another

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:14.880
newer, nicer iPhone within

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.880
the year, so I gotta hold out

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.880
for that

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.880
They've got that in common with Nintendo, don't they?

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.880
So, yeah

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:24.880
I really, really, really wanna get an iPad

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.880
because I'm a big fucking sheep

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.880
But I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait till next year

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.880
because I just know that camera

01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:32.880
on the front will be on next year's iPad

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.880
Well, Dan and I were actually

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.880
talking about how we both want

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:38.880
one, but we're specifically gonna

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:40.880
wait until another generation

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.880
goes by

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:44.880
And then we're

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:46.880
probably gonna get them

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:48.880
Also, by the way, just so you know,

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.880
not just the multitasking, voice over

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.880
IP in the background, like you can have Skype

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.880
running and get calls on Skype, it's pretty neat

01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:56.880
And, again, no, not on 3G

01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:58.880
And folders to

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:00.880
organize your stuff better, which

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.880
is actually really helpful

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:04.880
See, I think a lot of what they're incorporating, though, is stuff that they've actually stolen

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:06.880
from the jailbreakers

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:08.880
Yeah, I'm not surprised

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.880
My friend's got a jailbroken iPhone, and

01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:12.880
it's got folders and all kinds of stuff with it

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.880
and he can use it as a storage device

01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:16.880
and it's kinda crazy

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:18.880
And what was the other one?

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:20.880
Oh, ads, the iAds, now they're gonna

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.880
have, Apple's gonna have its own ad platform

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:24.880
because I guess they just didn't like AdMob

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:26.880
No, it's not that they didn't like it

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.880
They wanted a piece of it, but no flash

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:30.880
Also, it's very

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.880
interesting, I don't want to get too techy on you guys

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.880
but it's very interesting how Apple is

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.880
kind of kicking down Adobe

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.880
and they're also kicking down Google

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:40.880
Like, did you know that they are taking out

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:42.880
I mean, you still will be able to

01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:44.880
search on the new

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:46.880
iPhone 4.0 OS and you can use

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:48.880
Google as a search engine, but the button

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.880
will not say, like it says Google

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:52.880
right now, it doesn't say anything else

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.880
But they're opening it up for you to use Bing

01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:56.880
Yahoo, whatever

01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.880
That sounds pretty cool

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.880
I guess

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.880
I do like the stuff that's coming

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.880
with the 4.0 OS, you know, I'm a little bummed

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:06.880
that it won't work on my phone, but at the same time

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.880
I'm getting a little irritated with my phone

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:10.880
It locks up, it's slow

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.880
I don't know, I might need to wipe it

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.880
and reinstall everything, I don't know what the hell is

01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:16.880
making it run so crappy

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.880
But yet, here I am, still a sheet, but I will

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.880
Could it be the Apple created CPU inside

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:22.880
of it?

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.880
No?

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:26.880
I might have all these problems, but at the end

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:28.880
of the day, dang, I'll tell you, I use my

01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.880
iPhone so freaking much

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:32.880
It's a great little device to have in my pocket

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.880
I will say that

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.880
Anyhow, let's move on, something non-Apple

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:38.880
related, Dark Sakura

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:40.880
Well, there are some pretty big Final Fantasy

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:42.880
fans out and about

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.880
And there's one person who's doing a very

01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:46.880
interesting translation of it

01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.880
They are doing Final Fantasy in

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:50.880
um, Latin

01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:52.880
Yeah

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.880
Um, it's of course

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:56.880
going to be a ROM with a patch, but it's

01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:58.880
in Latin

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:00.880
Okay

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:02.880
That's hardcore

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.880
It just makes me think of Eddie

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.880
as they're talking about being mugged

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.880
and saying something to them in Latin, going

01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.880
Oh no, he knows Latin, run!

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.880
But I like the little

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.880
line that uh

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:16.880
Excuse me

01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:18.880
I must be allergic to Latin

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:20.880
Um, that Destructoid has in their

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:22.880
little article about it, it says, now can I get a copy

01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.880
of Alundra in Esperanto?

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:26.880
Nice

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:28.880
Isn't Esperanto like a

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.880
completely made up language, like it's not something

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:32.880
that is like It was meant to be a universal

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.880
language, so it takes elements from different

01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:36.880
I see And actually

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.880
it's, I'll tell you what Rob, you

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:40.880
can look right now at a page in Esperanto

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.880
and get an idea of what they're talking

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:44.880
about I see, because it derives

01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.880
a little bit from every language Exactly

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:48.880
Well that's kind of neat And I know people who are

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:50.880
learning it, so That's cool It sounds

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:52.880
cool I had a friend that spoke

01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:54.880
it actually, it was interesting to hear

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.880
I want to call her

01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.880
in Esperanto

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:00.880
I do not, because I have to

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:02.880
talk to the call, Jamie if somebody calls

01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:04.880
in Esperanto, you're talking to him

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:06.880
Uh, see

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:08.880
See, no

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.880
Anyhow

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:12.880
Loki

01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:14.880
Something in English please

01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:16.880
Uh, yes, Fear 3

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.880
has been announced, coming from

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:20.880
Warner Brothers, and

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.880
what's kind of neat about the new

01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:24.880
franchise in this horror

01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:26.880
shooter game, is actually

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:28.880
it's going to be

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.880
including cinematics created by

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.880
John Carpenter

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.880
The legendary horror

01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:36.880
master himself

01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:38.880
What's also cool, they're going to be having

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.880
the writer Steve Niles working

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.880
on it as well, he co-wrote

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:44.880
the script I guess, for the game with

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:46.880
Carpenter, and

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:48.880
Steve Niles you may not remember, he also did

01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.880
I believe the vampire movie

01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:52.880
30 days a night

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.880
So, pretty good pedigree there

01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:56.880
and I know the franchise has been pretty good

01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.880
Hell, Fear 2 had some pretty awesome

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:00.880
multiplayer in it, especially with like

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:02.880
all the maps, with like the Toy

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.880
Soldier maps

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.880
and the theme song for that trailer

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:08.880
which I still can't get out of my head

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:10.880
So

01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.880
Looking forward to it, and no

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.880
timeframe yet when it's been announced

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.880
It's supposed to be scheduled to be coming out in the fall

01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:18.880
probably around November, so

01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:20.880
on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:24.880
Is this a game you'd probably pick up?

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:26.880
I haven't played the other ones

01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.880
I've been kind of curious

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.880
to check it out, especially

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:32.880
number 2, but

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:34.880
maybe I'll check it out, I don't know

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.880
Well, more information coming out on

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.880
Red Dead Redemption

01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:40.880
Of course this game was also shown off at PAX East

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.880
That was probably one of those other games that

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:44.880
you would have liked to see

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.880
Well, they announced this week that multiplayer

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:48.880
Free Rome is going to be a feature in Red Dead Redemption

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.880
I believe that's also in Grand Theft Auto 4, correct?

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.880
It's something similar

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.880
It sounds very similar to

01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:56.880
Free Mode in

01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.880
Grand Theft Auto 4, but this one's

01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:00.880
I would say it's closer to

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:02.880
Party Mode in Grand Theft Auto 4

01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:04.880
where you can join in

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:06.880
Let me describe it a little bit here

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:08.880
You can explore the full single player game world

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.880
but you'll be in a multiplayer environment

01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.880
Remember Test Drive on

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.880
Xbox? It's kind of like that too

01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:16.880
But it's separate from the single player story mode

01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:18.880
So in Free Rome, you can either

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.880
go in by yourself, or you band together with

01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:22.880
friends, it's together in 8

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.880
and then you can take on other little bands

01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:26.880
You can either hunt down criminals together

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.880
or just shoot the shit out of each other

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:30.880
16 players in the same lobby

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.880
at once. Then you get experience points

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.880
as you do these different multiplayer modes

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:36.880
50 levels of character progressions

01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:38.880
The new XP will unlock new weapons,

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:40.880
mounts, characters, and challenges

01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:42.880
It sounds very similar to the Party Mode

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:44.880
in Grand Theft Auto 4 because you can basically

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.880
jump into

01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.880
It's like a lobby

01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.880
but it's basically just a portion of

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:52.880
the Grand Theft Auto map and if you really want to

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.880
you can just hang around in the lobby and

01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.880
drive all over the entire map

01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:58.880
or do whatever. So this is going to be

01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:00.880
very similar to that where you can

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.880
play more of a free form version of the game

01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:04.880
Plus they have areas where it will

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:06.880
launch different things like deathmatch modes

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.880
or hunting or

01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:10.880
I believe there's a

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:12.880
capture the gold type

01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:14.880
mode in there

01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.880
It'll be very cool

01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:18.880
I'm looking to try to mod this game to put

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:20.880
a car into it

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:22.880
I know the engine that they're using

01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:24.880
is probably extremely similar to

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:26.880
Grand Theft Auto and if it's anything

01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.880
like that game was set up it should be

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.880
very easy to do something similar like that

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:32.880
You and your freaking hacks

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:34.880
It would be hilarious. Always hacking something

01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:36.880
rocket launchers or something

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:38.880
Alright, well let's get to the segment

01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:40.880
of the show that doesn't involve cars

01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:42.880
or bringing things

01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:44.880
into places they shouldn't be except spam

01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:46.880
we do get a lot of spam that shouldn't be in the

01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:48.880
mailbag at orangelandtrader.com

01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:50.880
mailbag at orangelandtrader.com is our email address

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:52.880
for you to send your

01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:54.880
emails to every week. We read our favorites here

01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.880
on the show and respond to them

01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:58.880
DarkSakura likes to dive into the mailbag

01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:00.880
and pull out some of her favorites and read them

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:02.880
right now. Again, mailbag at orangelandtrader.com

01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:04.880
if you would like to participate sometime

01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:06.880
dsmaster26

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.880
sent an email

01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:10.880
Try not to sound too excited about it

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:12.880
It's um

01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:14.880
very badly written and

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:16.880
it's giving me a headache so I think I might just

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:18.880
translate it into real English

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.880
Okay, go for it

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:22.880
I could try and read it the way

01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:24.880
it's written

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.880
I could do it

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:28.880
Okay, as it's written

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:30.880
Dear C4 and O.L.R. Crew

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:32.880
I am giving

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:34.880
a giant F.U.

01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:36.880
to is Microsoft because of them

01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:38.880
raping me

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.880
in the ass for 50 bucks

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:42.880
Okay, I can't take it anymore, translate please

01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.880
Okay, um

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:46.880
Dear O.L.R. Crew, I'm giving a giant F.U. to Microsoft

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:48.880
because of them raping me in the ass for 50 bucks a year

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.880
That is crap

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:52.880
I should have bought a 360

01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:54.880
I should have bought

01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:56.880
It's spelled B.O.U. not B.A.U

01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:58.880
Bought the PS3

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:00.880
At least you should have instead of should of

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.880
I hate that

01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:04.880
It is should have, would have, could have

01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:06.880
So he doesn't get an F

01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.880
He gets a D-

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:10.880
So thank you for at least avoiding one of my pet peeves

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:12.880
Um, here are the reasons

01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:14.880
why

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.880
Okay

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:18.880
Cry

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.880
No, it's

01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:22.880
region is R-E-G-I-O-N

01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:24.880
Not R-E-G-I-N

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:26.880
Um, locking

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.880
new Beatmania to DX17

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:30.880
Free online play

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:32.880
No cost

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:34.880
Netflix without paying for PSN

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.880
And finally

01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:38.880
That's all wrong

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:40.880
And finally, five, um

01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:42.880
Bluetooth, okay, god this sucks

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:44.880
Punctuation

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:46.880
Do you speak it?

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:48.880
Do you speak it?

01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:50.880
Thank you

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:52.880
Many phones have Bluetooth

01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:54.880
Therefore, therefore ends in an E

01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:56.880
by the way

01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:58.880
I can use the headset for both my phone

01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:00.880
and PS3

02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:02.880
I'm wondering

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.880
Is it, I

02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:06.880
I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for

02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:08.880
Bimani titles for PS3 and 360

02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:10.880
Please help, I'm on a Bimani binge

02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:12.880
ever since I played 2DX17

02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:14.880
at the arcade in Omaha

02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:16.880
DS Master 26

02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:18.880
There's really not a lot available on the

02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:20.880
360 and PS3, I will tell you

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.880
no way in hell should you spend any money on Beat and Groovy

02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:24.880
Honestly, I like DJ Hero

02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:26.880
a lot, I know that's not Bimani technically

02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:28.880
but as far as music game goes

02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:30.880
it's really the best with

02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:32.880
Rock Band

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.880
Like if you're looking for like DDR and stuff

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:36.880
there's just not a lot of great stuff

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.880
You can go for Dance Dance Revolution Universe

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:40.880
and I would say Universe 2

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.880
is probably the best of the series

02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:44.880
You can get Universe 3 very easily though

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:46.880
but it's on the

02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:48.880
auto games or whatever

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:50.880
Karaoke Revolution

02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.880
if you like that kind of stuff

02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:54.880
Not my favorite

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:56.880
And if you really want the true Bimani experience

02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:58.880
that they've brought to you straight to the next gen system

02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:00.880
then Rock Revolution is definitely a title for you

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:04.880
That'll basically tell you

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:06.880
what they think of the new systems

02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:08.880
There's a PS on here

02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:10.880
Okay

02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:12.880
If he does a perfect attack and freestyle DDR match

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:14.880
he will go down, not bloody likely

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.880
How do you perfect attack a freestyle?

02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.880
I think he means

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:22.880
a perfect attack and then

02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:24.880
a freestyle

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:26.880
I've seen people do both

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:28.880
The guy who had one leg

02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:30.880
Did he even play DDR anymore?

02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:32.880
There was a guy who had one leg

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.880
that played on crutches that perfect attacked

02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:36.880
while he did a freestyle

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:38.880
You know I haven't asked him

02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.880
to listen to this show though

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:42.880
so maybe he can email us and tell us

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:44.880
I think he still kind of follows it

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.880
He does a lot of DJ'ing

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:48.880
gigs and stuff

02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:50.880
Not DJ Hero but real actual DJ'ing

02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:52.880
I know that's a big hobby of his now

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.880
Where are they now?

02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:56.880
That would be a fun segment to do on OLR

02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:58.880
someday

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:00.880
Where are they now? Bimani favorites

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.880
Where is Jahi?

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:04.880
I haven't heard from Jahi in a long time

02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:06.880
Maybe we need to do this

02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:08.880
on OLR special

02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:10.880
Maybe for our anniversary

02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:12.880
Find Bimani people from back in the day

02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:14.880
and do a where are they now segment

02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:16.880
A lot of our newer listeners

02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:18.880
wouldn't understand

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.880
Who cares?

02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.880
I broke out the orange bat

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.880
I know you did

02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:26.880
Have you seen Wendell lately?

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:28.880
I heard he lost a lot of weight

02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:30.880
He's looking pretty good

02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:32.880
He's in good shape

02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:34.880
You know what we should do? Let's plan this

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:36.880
By the way Wendell, I'm very proud of you

02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:38.880
Our 8th anniversary would be the last week of June

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:40.880
We should try to find as many

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.880
old school Bimani players

02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:44.880
as possible and invite them to a show

02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:46.880
and we could tape it

02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:48.880
Step Squad RTF reunion?

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:50.880
We wouldn't necessarily have to do it here

02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:52.880
We could find a place to remote broadcast

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:54.880
We could go to Sweet Tomatoes

02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:56.880
I don't know, we'll have to find a big space

02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:58.880
That used to be where we'd all meet up to go to dinner

02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.880
years and years ago

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:02.880
We'd go to Sweet Tomatoes and Concord

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:04.880
and figure something out

02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:06.880
We're gonna do that

02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:08.880
for our next anniversary show

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:10.880
Number 9

02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:12.880
I should go on DDR for you, you can post something

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:14.880
NorCal famous DDR players wanted

02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:16.880
for a reunion special or something like that

02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:18.880
That'd be fun

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:20.880
I keep a lot of them on my Facebook

02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:22.880
I swear, because there are too many people to have here

02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:24.880
and I don't have a big garage anymore

02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:26.880
Dave and Busters

02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:28.880
We could do a road show

02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:30.880
I'm set up to do that because of PAX

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:32.880
We could do a road show and on top of that

02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:34.880
We just couldn't do that live

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:36.880
Actually, all contrary

02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.880
I may have my Wi-Fi tether

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:40.880
on my phone working

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.880
They have a Wi-Fi tether for the 3GS

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.880
That would be tough to do

02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.880
96k to all games, that would be tough

02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.880
on a Wi-Fi tether

02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:50.880
I don't know

02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:52.880
If anybody knows how to do it, Scott probably does

02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:54.880
because I think he's done it before

02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:56.880
I'll talk to him about it

02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:58.880
We'll see

02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:00.880
Also, now

02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:02.880
I had received the first email

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:04.880
that you sent me before

02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:06.880
but I've just been so wiped out and busy

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.880
The man

02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:10.880
that I met at the Atari party

02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:12.880
Sal

02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:14.880
He sent an email and he sent me

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.880
some stuff that I want to play

02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:18.880
Was that the music guy?

02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:20.880
I totally want to interview him

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.880
If I was not flat broke

02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:24.880
I want to order one of the systems

02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:26.880
that he's got

02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:28.880
The name's for the

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:30.880
Atari 800 XL

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:32.880
Working on Outrun

02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:34.880
Has a version of Space Harrier

02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:36.880
that's actually really sweet

02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:38.880
Complete with voice, by the way

02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.880
I'm very impressed

02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:42.880
I'll go ahead and give him a plug

02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.880
It's

02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:46.880
KJ Mann's

02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:48.880
Atari Sales and Electronics

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:50.880
You'll find him on eBay

02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:52.880
He's really cool

02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:54.880
The stuff

02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.880
The ports that he's worked with

02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:58.880
are just amazing

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:00.880
They're amazing

02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.880
I'm very impressed

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:04.880
We'll try to get him on the show

02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:06.880
It'll be fun

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:08.880
We'll get him to come to this OLR Con

02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:10.880
we're suddenly planning

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.880
I wonder how much it costs to rent

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:14.880
a big hall somewhere

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:16.880
Maybe we should call it OLR Con

02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.880
Just do OLR Con, for real

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:20.880
Just fucking do it already

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:22.880
My brain just suddenly made

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:24.880
OLR Con asylum

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.880
I don't know

02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.880
We'll have to think about it

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:30.880
How could we do OLR Con and not have it fail miserably

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:32.880
where we're going to spend a lot of money on it

02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.880
I don't know, we have to think about this

02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:36.880
I think it's King of Rush

02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:38.880
Okay

02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:40.880
Why was Rob's mom

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:42.880
pwning all of us with that last phrase?

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.880
That must have been texted or something

02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:46.880
during the show

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:48.880
Cause she's my mother, it's where I get my sense of humor from

02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:50.880
And don't you dare

02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:52.880
be trash about her

02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:54.880
Rob's mom is such a nice lady

02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:56.880
She's fun

02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:58.880
So, I got one from Rababa

02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:00.880
That's an Orange Lounge

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:02.880
radio

02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:04.880
wordle

02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:06.880
And, dude, I love

02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:08.880
anything that's typography

02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:10.880
Oh, I saw that, it's like the art

02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:12.880
with all the common words from our

02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.880
website, kind of like if it's used

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:16.880
a lot, then it's big, if it's not

02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:18.880
B4U

02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:20.880
B4U, at the time he did that

02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.880
was like being highlighted

02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:24.880
as like the, I love that song

02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:26.880
You know that segment, the Dark Tetsuya in Act F

02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:28.880
that some people do for our site?

02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:30.880
I think B4U was like the song

02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:32.880
that was up at the moment that that happened

02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:34.880
I'm totally going to save the pictures

02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:36.880
I mean, it's generated in Flash, but I have this

02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:38.880
There's this little

02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:40.880
fun tool to grab

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.880
images off by doing

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:44.880
just a plain old screenshot of it

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:46.880
You can crop them, I love this thing

02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:48.880
and I'm trying to remember, I think it's called Pixlr

02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:50.880
It's a plug-in for

02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.880
um

02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:54.880
whatever the crap this program is

02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:56.880
that I'm using

02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:58.880
But anyway

02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:00.880
Um

02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:02.880
But yeah, it's really cool, I like it

02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:04.880
And

02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:06.880
he

02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:08.880
I like, he puts a comment that I suppose

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:10.880
that wordle filters out crashwords

02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:12.880
Um, and

02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:14.880
then the last one is

02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:16.880
um

02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.880
from somebody

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:20.880
who hasn't put a name on here

02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.880
I'm just going to say Brandon

02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:24.880
because that's the

02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:26.880
closest thing I can find

02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:28.880
Dear OLR, after listening to OLR archive episode

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:30.880
I have started

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:32.880
to have a bimani craze

02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:34.880
so I spent my whole allowance

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.880
$30 on tokens

02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:38.880
and I played some BeatMania 2DX, read

02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:40.880
Cranked

02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:42.880
to 11

02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:44.880
Guitar Freaks, Drummania

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:46.880
Parapara, DDR, Poppin' Music

02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:48.880
and keyboardmania, it was epic fun

02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:50.880
Rob,

02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:52.880
we need to go

02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:54.880
to Rviggle soon

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:56.880
We can go, I mean

02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:58.880
it's just down the street

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:00.880
I know, but I want to play

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:02.880
Rob, I gotta dance

02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.880
Alright

02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:10.880
Well anyhow, let's move on

02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:12.880
to the part of the show

02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:14.880
where we get a little bit of angst off our

02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:16.880
chest, it's the FUs of the week

02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:18.880
and they're going to start right now

02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:34.880
FU to the

02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:36.880
big pile of

02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:38.880
carrot cake in my fridge

02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:40.880
I

02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:42.880
have eaten almost nothing but carrot cake

02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:44.880
all day, except when I came home

02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:46.880
and ate a rib

02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:48.880
I ate a rib

02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:50.880
Oh, and some chips

02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:52.880
It was very tasty rib, it was delicious

02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:54.880
and I think

02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:56.880
he got kosher beef too

02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:58.880
anyway, it was really good

02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:00.880
but anyway

02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:02.880
I can't

02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:04.880
I can't eat any more cake

02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:06.880
I can't, I don't think that I can

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:08.880
and my

02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:10.880
my tummy behaved

02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:12.880
very well yesterday despite all the beer

02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:14.880
I think all the beer broke everything else down

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:16.880
but today I'm suffering for it, so

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:18.880
fuck you gluten

02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:20.880
done

02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:22.880
Go ahead Logie

02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:24.880
FU to the KFC

02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:26.880
special sauce that they put on the

02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:28.880
KFC Double Down, it really

02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:30.880
ruined the Double Down and it's unfortunate

02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:32.880
because it had the potential to be

02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:34.880
a great, unhealthy piece of

02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:36.880
chicken that I could have eaten

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:38.880
but instead it was

02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:40.880
just all nasty sauce that they tasted

02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:42.880
maybe next time I will have to do

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.880
the pseudo

02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:46.880
Windows 7 burger and get a 7x7

02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:48.880
from

02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:50.880
Oops, Holik came in early, my bad

02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:52.880
I was gonna say that

02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:54.880
FU to Holik, playing early

02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:56.880
anyways, yeah, so

02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:58.880
a

02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:00.880
I should do a Windows

02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:02.880
7 pseudo burger

02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:04.880
from In-N-Out 7x7

02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:06.880
I've had a

02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:08.880
4x4 before, they're really

02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:10.880
not as filling as you would think

02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:12.880
My FU

02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:14.880
of the week goes to my confidence

02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:16.880
and self esteem because I'm starting a new job

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:18.880
tomorrow and I'm really nervous

02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:20.880
it's gonna be like so

02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:22.880
different for me, they're all gonna laugh at you

02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:24.880
laugh at me, no, I know I'll do fine

02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:26.880
but it's just, it's weird because like guys

02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:28.880
seriously, the day job I've had, I've been

02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:30.880
because, okay, it was funny because when

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:32.880
I post, I have listeners on my Facebook and when I

02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:34.880
posted to Facebook that I was leaving my old

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:36.880
job, people were like, oh, you get to do OLR full

02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:38.880
time now and I'm like

02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.880
hahaha

02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:42.880
hahaha

02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:44.880
hahaha, that's funny

02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:46.880
yeah

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:48.880
no, I mean, it's

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:50.880
great that people think that we could actually

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:52.880
profit from this show, but no, my

02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.880
day job that I do

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.880
the day job I have to pay them, in fact

02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:58.880
trying to plan this OLR con, I'm

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.880
thinking like, how do I lose the least

02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:02.880
amount of money in planning this

02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.880
but anyway

02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:06.880
on a

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:08.880
serious note, I have a day job and the day job I've had

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:10.880
I've had for the past like seven years

02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:12.880
so almost as long as OLR has been

02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:14.880
going on, which is a fucking long time, just you know

02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:16.880
and I'm changing that, I'm doing

02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:18.880
a new job starting tomorrow and it's

02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:20.880
kind of nerve-wracking, but

02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:22.880
I think it'll be good, I'm

02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:24.880
excited about what the

02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:26.880
new position is and obviously I don't like to talk a lot about

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.880
my day job on the show, because I don't want no presents

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.880
showing up at my workplace

02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:32.880
or bombs, you know what I mean

02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:34.880
yeah, please no, just

02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:36.880
no, so anyhow

02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:38.880
yeah, I mean, I think it's great

02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:40.880
that people send gifts, but I don't know, just something

02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:42.880
weird about having my address out there

02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.880
I'd just like to know who you are, that's all

02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:46.880
it was also on my business card, well, our

02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:48.880
Orange Lunch Radio business card

02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:50.880
so you think one of our...

02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:52.880
someone could have gotten it, I don't know, who knows, alright, anyhow

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:54.880
I'm over it, alright, that's it for the FUs

02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:56.880
of the Week, couple more news stories for you guys

02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:58.880
then the Skype line, and believe it or not

02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:00.880
our chat, or I'm sorry

02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:02.880
our phone works again, it was broken

02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:04.880
last week, it works again

02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:06.880
877-GAME-OLR works

02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:08.880
also Orange Lunch Radio on Skype, both

02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:10.880
of them will work, but we're not taking calls yet

02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:12.880
we still got two more stories, Loki

02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:14.880
yes, so let's talk a little

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.880
bit about how

02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:18.880
not to do collector's editions

02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:20.880
that's right, Splinter Cell

02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:22.880
Conviction, it's a wonderful game

02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:24.880
coming out this coming week

02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:26.880
here, and apparently

02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:28.880
they're dropping $10 off the

02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:30.880
price of the collector's edition because

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:32.880
guess what, the USB drive that they included

02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:34.880
with it is faulty

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.880
apparently there's

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:38.880
a possibility of faulty USB drives

02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:40.880
included with the game, and so

02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:42.880
they're knocking $10 off of it to

02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:44.880
kind of compensate for that

02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:46.880
and apparently none of the other

02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:48.880
content has been affected, but

02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:50.880
the bonus content included on the USB

02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:52.880
drive may be inaccessible

02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:54.880
in some copies

02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:56.880
well that turned out

02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:58.880
to be a bummer for someone, didn't it?

02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:00.880
yeah, that is a bummer, and

02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:02.880
let me tell you this much

02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:04.880
from a

02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:06.880
distributor, reseller

02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:08.880
standpoint, that's gonna be

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.880
a fucking bitch when I come in on Monday

02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:12.880
because we're gonna have to deal with all

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:14.880
these credits to people that

02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:16.880
we sold the game to because

02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.880
Ubisoft fucked up, so

02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:20.880
thank you, Ubisoft

02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:22.880
appreciate it

02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:24.880
and whoever manufactured those little USB cards

02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:26.880
are gonna get taken to the cleaners

02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:28.880
you know what I mean?

02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:30.880
yeah

02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:32.880
and you know, really the USB cards

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.880
what they have on them here, they've got a little

02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:36.880
artwork here

02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:38.880
is a credit card size

02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:40.880
USB drive that had

02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:42.880
making of video, concept art renders

02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:44.880
screenshots, storyboards

02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:46.880
and wallpapers, who gives a shit

02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.880
well can't you format that thing now and use it as

02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:50.880
storage on your 360?

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.880
no you cannot because I don't believe it is over a gig

02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:54.880
you need at least a gig

02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:56.880
to be able to use it, so

02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:58.880
and you really wanna have 16 gigs

02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:00.880
cause you only get two cards, right?

02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:02.880
this is so weird to me

02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:04.880
so weird to me, well it was kind of a slow news week

02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:06.880
and we found this article on

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:08.880
as a popular destination on Dig

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:10.880
and I thought what the hell, we'll bring it up on the show

02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:12.880
it's from IGN and it talks about the most

02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:14.880
anticipated Xbox Live arcade games

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.880
that are coming up to the service

02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:18.880
and I thought I'd kind of gauge the reaction here

02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.880
in studio, if our studio folks are excited

02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:22.880
about these games, and those of you in chat

02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:24.880
as well, kind of leading into

02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:26.880
phone calls, this makes a good story

02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:28.880
this is from IGN.com, so you know, take it with a grain of salt

02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:30.880
Limbo

02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:32.880
is one of the games that they talk about here

02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:34.880
and this was pretty cool, they had

02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:36.880
they were demoing this at PAX East, it's kind of like that

02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:38.880
black and white, very artistic kind of

02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:40.880
style with it, look kind of neat

02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:42.880
Sonic the Hedgehog 4

02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:44.880
very anticipated Xbox Live game

02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:46.880
Yay!

02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:48.880
Shank!

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.880
That was being shown at PAX earlier this year

02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:52.880
it's not Shaft, but Shank

02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:54.880
and he has a steel blade

02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:56.880
it's very bloody, looks like your kind of game

02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:58.880
Hydrophobia, which was also

02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:00.880
shown at PAX East, it's like

02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:02.880
kind of a Tomb Raider-ish type of game

02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:04.880
but she's afraid of the water

02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:06.880
well that makes me think of Bioshock

02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:08.880
Puzzle Quest 2

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:10.880
Don't care

02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:12.880
Speak for yourself, I am totally on this

02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:14.880
That's why I was speaking for myself, I don't care

02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:16.880
I do care, so I'm excited about that

02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:18.880
Might and Magic Clash of Heroes

02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:20.880
Don't care

02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:22.880
Yeah, looks like it could be interesting

02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:24.880
The art style looks really good

02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:26.880
because it's

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:28.880
They have it on the DS

02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:30.880
Super Meat Boy

02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:32.880
Yay!

02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:34.880
Don't care

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:36.880
I have a custom coffee mug

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:38.880
that I painted Super Meat Boy on

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:40.880
Oh really? That's cute

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:42.880
Also on the other side has Eduardo the Samurai Toaster

02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:44.880
That's my WeWear

02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:46.880
coffee mug that I made

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:48.880
And I'm actually kidding, it looks interesting

02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:50.880
Comic Jumper

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.880
I don't know this one

02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:54.880
Oh, The Maw and Explosion Man

02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:56.880
That's a good developer there

02:15:56.880 --> 02:15:58.880
Okay, Comedy Shooter

02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:00.880
Is that supposed to be like Earthworm Jim or something?

02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:02.880
Probably, similar

02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:04.880
Monday Night Combat

02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:06.880
That looks awesome

02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:08.880
They had a business at PAX East

02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:10.880
And they had an announcer guy out there on the show floor

02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:12.880
So it seems like all of these games

02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:14.880
were just PAX East games

02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:16.880
I think someone at IGN

02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:18.880
got a little lazy

02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:20.880
There you go

02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:22.880
I'm also looking forward to Magic Sword Double Impact

02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:24.880
Or whatever they're actually calling it

02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:26.880
That's coming out

02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:28.880
So funny

02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:32.880
Anyhow, the phones

02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:34.880
are now open

02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:36.880
And Game OLR or our username on Skype

02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:38.880
is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:40.880
If you'd like to call to talk about, I don't know

02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:42.880
Anticipated Xbox Live Arcade Games or heck anything

02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:44.880
I know, you know, we were out

02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:46.880
two weeks ago and then last week

02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:48.880
we had some troubles with the phones and we were only able to

02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:50.880
take a couple calls

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:52.880
So I'm sure there will be plenty of people who want to get through tonight

02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:54.880
And that's fine, we have a little extra time for calls

02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:56.880
I don't want to do the show too late tonight

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:58.880
But we have some time for calls

02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:00.880
So again, 877 Game OLR

02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:02.880
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:04.880
It is now open and available for calls

02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:06.880
SHA100Matt wants us to know

02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:08.880
he played MNC at PAX East

02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:10.880
and it was awesome

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:12.880
Okay, the phones are starting to ring, here we go

02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:14.880
Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:16.880
It's Ranma

02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:18.880
Looks like I got through the first time once again

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:20.880
Look at you, you must have the

02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:22.880
least amount of lag or something

02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:24.880
Well, what's up?

02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:26.880
Not too much, man

02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:28.880
Couple of things now

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:30.880
To reference back to earlier in the episode

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:32.880
They did port Twilight Seen It

02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.880
to the Nintendo DS

02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:36.880
Came out about a couple of months ago

02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:38.880
But Twilight Seen It

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:40.880
isn't like a Twilight game to me

02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:42.880
I know, but

02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:44.880
I get your points

02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:46.880
But it's just like, they need to make an actual game

02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:48.880
Well, actually they don't need to, but I'm surprised

02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:50.880
they haven't, you know what I mean?

02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:52.880
Well, Rob, I'm all for a

02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:54.880
Twilight game, provided it plays

02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:56.880
in a third person shooter like Conker's Bad Fur Day

02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:58.880
and I get to shoot them all up

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:00.880
Then I will buy that

02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:02.880
I don't know if I'd

02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:04.880
buy it, but I might get it on Gamefly

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:08.880
So that way I feel like I'm not

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.880
really supporting them, but

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.880
even if I am a little bit

02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:14.880
You won't feel as dirty

02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:16.880
Alright, well there you go

02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:18.880
What else is on your mind, buddy?

02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:20.880
About an article earlier today

02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:22.880
about the kid that stole the code from Breach

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:24.880
Yes, although

02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:26.880
technically that was last week's show, but that's okay

02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.880
Last week we had the phone problems

02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.880
What do you think?

02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:32.880
I was trying to call in, but

02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:34.880
on our podcast we covered this

02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:36.880
and my

02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:38.880
gaming girl who did

02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:40.880
some research on the article

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:42.880
it seems that

02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.880
the company that did the game I think is Atomic Games

02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:46.880
they're backed by the CIA

02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:48.880
so I'm

02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:50.880
kind of thinking that this was all like a little

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.880
set up, like a publicity stunt

02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:54.880
Well, now hold on

02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:56.880
Didn't they say that because

02:18:56.880 --> 02:18:58.880
of what you're saying that it actually

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:00.880
made this theft of the code a lot

02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:02.880
worse than it would be otherwise

02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:04.880
like this kid is almost being

02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:06.880
investigated by the FBI at this point

02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:08.880
I don't know, I might be throwing in some extra

02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:10.880
stuff there, but it seemed like

02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:12.880
from what we were reporting last week, what he did

02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:14.880
wasn't just bad, it was really bad

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:16.880
Pretty much

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:18.880
but if you're going to cross reference that

02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:20.880
in, I'm just saying

02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:22.880
because of how this came out

02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:24.880
I don't know about you, but

02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:26.880
if this was a big deal, don't you think everybody

02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:28.880
at PAX would have been hearing about this?

02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:32.880
Maybe they did, maybe it just happened

02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:34.880
at a time we weren't around, I don't know

02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.880
I certainly didn't hear anything like that

02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:38.880
I didn't either, but at the same time

02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:40.880
I was kind of in and out of there

02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:42.880
we left to eat, we left

02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:44.880
I came in late a lot of days

02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:46.880
just because of the time zone thing

02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:48.880
I don't know

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:50.880
It would be a really weird

02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.880
obesity stunt type of thing

02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:54.880
Weren't there court documents produced

02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:56.880
and everything too?

02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:58.880
I have no idea

02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:00.880
I have not heard anything about it

02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:02.880
I will believe

02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:04.880
this guy actually did something

02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:06.880
stupid, you know

02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:08.880
but if there are no court documents, I call shenanigans

02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:10.880
I see where you're coming from though

02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:12.880
how could someone be so

02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:14.880
colossally stupid, it just seems so fake

02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:16.880
but some people

02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:18.880
are that stupid, Rama

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:20.880
I know, I used to work

02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:22.880
with people like that

02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:24.880
Well

02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:26.880
I don't know, fake or not

02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:28.880
it certainly has got everybody talking

02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:30.880
which, yeah

02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:32.880
you might have hit the nail on the head of the irony

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:34.880
of it, is that more people are talking about this game now

02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:36.880
than probably would have otherwise

02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:38.880
Pretty much

02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:40.880
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, my friend?

02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:44.880
That's pretty much it

02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:48.880
ActDeaf in our chat wants to say Matt posted the court files earlier

02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:50.880
He's probably digging up the links again right now

02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:52.880
so stay tuned to our chat rooms

02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:54.880
Yeah, I'll definitely be following that

02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:56.880
Alright, take care buddy

02:20:56.880 --> 02:20:58.880
Alright, bye-bye

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:00.880
Let's go back to the phones

02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:02.880
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio, who's this?

02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:04.880
Hi, it's Ray Iyanami

02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:06.880
Hey, Ray Iyanami, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:10.880
I came up from Stock Card Con last week

02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:12.880
my first Stock Card Con

02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:14.880
You went all the way up to Seattle

02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:16.880
to go to Stock Card Con?

02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.880
Yes, I went with some friends

02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:20.880
to meet up with some friends up there

02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:22.880
among other things

02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:24.880
Well, I don't know, you don't sound too happy

02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:26.880
was it a good time, or what happened?

02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:28.880
I'm sorry, I'm just tired for this week

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:30.880
so

02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:34.880
Anyway, Stock Card Con is pretty cool, yes

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:38.880
I get to play a lot of games there

02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:40.880
like Tetris or Grandmaster 3

02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:44.880
and some other crap

02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:47.880
Well, I'm glad you said nice things about it in the end

02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:49.880
because our buddy John who does

02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:51.880
Understation Live with Travis

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:53.880
I know is a big part of putting on Stock Card Con

02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:55.880
Did you happen to run into him at all?

02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:57.880
He's probably too busy

02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:00.880
I saw him hosting the Anime Magician panel

02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:02.880
but

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:04.880
I didn't get a chance to talk to him much

02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:06.880
so I never actually got to meet him

02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:08.880
Eh, it happens

02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:10.880
Had you ever been to that venue before?

02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:12.880
Because that's the same place they do PAX Prime

02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.880
No, it was my first time

02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:18.880
I was surprised at how big it was

02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:21.880
I could actually compare it to a shopping mall

02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:24.880
Especially since part of it is like a shopping mall

02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:27.880
Yeah, it's kind of integrated right into the downtown scene there, isn't it?

02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:29.880
Well, tell us a little more about the gaming they had there

02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:31.880
Did they have like a big room? Were they doing tournaments?

02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:33.880
What was kind of going on with gaming?

02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:35.880
Well, they had an arcade

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:37.880
but it wasn't too big

02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:39.880
Mostly DVR

02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:41.880
In the Groove

02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:44.880
They had a Pumped Up Pro 2 Location Test

02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:46.880
They had NFL Day 4

02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:48.880
guitar-proofing, drum-mania

02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:51.880
and Patrick P, Jim's Threes and myself already

02:22:51.880 --> 02:22:54.880
I would have played Pumped Up Pro 2

02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:57.880
but unfortunately, like the 2DS, I was at the con

02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:00.880
I was wearing a concept that involved dress shoes

02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:02.880
and dress shoes and

02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.880
arrow-stopping games

02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:06.880
those seemed like a good idea

02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.880
Were you cosplaying?

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:10.880
What were you cosplaying as?

02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:12.880
I was cosplaying as a

02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:14.880
shell from Pop'n Music

02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:16.880
the librarian guy

02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:18.880
and Apollo Justice

02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:20.880
I wanted to cosplay as this one character

02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:22.880
cosplay as this one character from Toho

02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:24.880
but I didn't have a costume prepared

02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:26.880
and

02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:28.880
speaking of the Toho panel

02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:30.880
there was one thing that I didn't like about it

02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:33.880
and that was them trying to demonstrate the Toho games

02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:36.880
they tried to demonstrate it by showing

02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:38.880
one of the game's later stages

02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:40.880
on lunatic difficulty

02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:42.880
but it's basically a difficulty level of a part

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:44.880
and as a small fan, they kind of pissed me off

02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:48.880
Because maybe they made the game look way harder than it really is?

02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:50.880
Yeah, pretty much

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:53.880
I mean, I'm pretty sure a lot of the people who weren't really into

02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:55.880
the Naku games were just confused

02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:57.880
what the hell was going on

02:23:57.880 --> 02:23:59.880
I mean, if I was running

02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:00.880
If I was

02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:02.880
If I had a partner running the panel

02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:04.880
alongside the infamous stuff

02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:06.880
I would also show demonstration using

02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:08.880
easier stages and difficulties

02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:11.880
Something that requires effort

02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:13.880
to get through

02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:15.880
but is still pretty watchable

02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:17.880
that way people who are new to the series

02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:19.880
can have a grasp of

02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:21.880
what it's like to play the game

02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:23.880
instead of just saying

02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:25.880
Oh wow, pretty bullets, super adequate

02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:27.880
dodge, any of that shit

02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:29.880
Yeah, it's

02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:31.880
I gotta say though

02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:33.880
a lot of those shmups are so hard to me

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:35.880
but you know, it takes talent

02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:37.880
to be good at them though, takes talent

02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:39.880
That's for sure

02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:41.880
I mean, whenever I try to show people

02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:43.880
games, I don't go

02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:45.880
straight to like full rising

02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:47.880
if it's a fighting game or

02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:49.880
showing them level 43 points on top

02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:51.880
I try to show them

02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:53.880
easier stuff, something you can actually understand

02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:55.880
Like, a few months ago

02:24:55.880 --> 02:24:57.880
I was at an arcade with a friend of mine

02:24:57.880 --> 02:24:59.880
and she went through the top

02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:01.880
so I kind of

02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:03.880
popped into her use of easier

02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:05.880
songs, even if it meant songs that

02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:07.880
I didn't find to be as fun as

02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:09.880
songs that I usually play

02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:11.880
That's a really good point, is that if you're not wanting to scare someone

02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:13.880
off, especially with the music games, you shouldn't

02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:15.880
show off right away, like a lot of people

02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:17.880
I think sometimes just want to like show off

02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:19.880
how good they are at a game, so they'll pick like

02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:21.880
the really hard song and like, look how cool this game

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:23.880
can be, and then people are like, ooh, I'm too scared to touch that

02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:25.880
I don't want to touch that, so you kind of have to

02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:27.880
warn people into it by showing them like, you know, on

02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:29.880
the rock band, the easy mode, or you know

02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:31.880
a one star, whatever difficulties

02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:33.880
they're doing in pop music these days

02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:35.880
you know, the really low end songs

02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:37.880
and that kind of goes with video games in general, like if you

02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:39.880
don't want to scare someone off, like you know they wouldn't

02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:41.880
like a shooter game, don't show them Halo

02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:43.880
or Gears of War, show them a video game

02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:45.880
that might be more their tastes

02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:47.880
you know, like whether that be something like

02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:49.880
one versus a hundred, you know, might be

02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:51.880
a really good enabler for people

02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:53.880
to see that there's more to video games than that

02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:55.880
or, you know, something on the Wii

02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:57.880
I don't know, it is interesting

02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:59.880
I think sometimes people really

02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:01.880
scare people off from video games without realizing it

02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:03.880
because they go right for the hard stuff

02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:05.880
and a lot of people do get intimidated

02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:07.880
Yeah, there

02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:09.880
are, I think, channels and forums

02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:11.880
I hang out at where people are not

02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:13.880
too good at video games, so

02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:15.880
I kind of get

02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:17.880
how they feel about not being

02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:19.880
able to get past the

02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:21.880
first season for Shmopp on, even on easy

02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:23.880
difficulty

02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:25.880
Alright, well

02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:27.880
we gotta let you go so we can get some more

02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:29.880
calls, but, so, SakuraCon, do you think

02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:31.880
you'd try to go back next year?

02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:33.880
Um, possibly

02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:35.880
if my spring break is around

02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:37.880
SakuraCon again, because that lets you

02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:39.880
one big deciding factor

02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:41.880
in me doing it. Last year it didn't line up

02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:43.880
with my spring break, so I didn't go

02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:45.880
So if the timing's right, it just might be in the

02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:47.880
cards. Alright, well, we gotta let you go

02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:49.880
to get more calls, but take care of Ray, okay?

02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:51.880
You too. Alright, later

02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:53.880
Alright, I'll take a couple more calls

02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:55.880
here. 877-GAME-OLR

02:26:55.880 --> 02:26:57.880
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:26:57.880 --> 02:26:59.880
Take a few more calls

02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:01.880
here before we call it a night at

02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:03.880
OLR Studios. Some last minute

02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:05.880
stories tonight we'll have in just a moment

02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:07.880
but first, another call. Hi, you're

02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:09.880
on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:11.880
Hi, this is Spasinator

02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:13.880
Hey, Spasinator, you're

02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:15.880
cutting in and out a little bit, but we'll try to move

02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:17.880
ahead. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:19.880
Sorry about that, I'm on a

02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:21.880
cell phone and unfortunately some

02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:23.880
stuff in my building interferes

02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:25.880
with the signal. That's okay.

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:27.880
But anyway, I tried

02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:29.880
calling in last week to give you

02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:31.880
updates as to my

02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:33.880
PlayStation 3 situation

02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:35.880
Oh yeah, it's been a little while since we heard about that

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:37.880
Yeah, we had our phone issues last week. Well, what's

02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:39.880
the latest and greatest?

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:41.880
I can make this short

02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:43.880
and sweet. You know,

02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:45.880
I'll probably gloss over the details, but

02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:47.880
the drill points are

02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:49.880
that I got my

02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:51.880
PS3 back on the 30th

02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:53.880
and

02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:55.880
a few days later, they

02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:57.880
started putting my

02:27:57.880 --> 02:27:59.880
videos back onto my

02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:01.880
download queue

02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:03.880
because the video store

02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:05.880
works differently than the

02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:07.880
game side of the store. Anyway,

02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:09.880
it took a while

02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:11.880
for everything to show up

02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:13.880
because they had to do

02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:15.880
everything manually

02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:17.880
and reauthorize everything

02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:19.880
and I get like over several hundred

02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:21.880
videos, but needless

02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:23.880
to say, I

02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:25.880
got all my videos back, so I don't have to

02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:27.880
worry about that now.

02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:29.880
Wow, 700 videos. Oh my gosh.

02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:31.880
Okay.

02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:33.880
Yeah, well, not all those videos

02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:35.880
are paid for. Some of those are

02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:37.880
like

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:39.880
the free music game

02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:41.880
out is like promotions to get

02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:43.880
you to buy throughout the series

02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:45.880
or whatever that's there.

02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:47.880
But

02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:49.880
needless to say, I got my

02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:51.880
videos back and

02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:53.880
hopefully

02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:55.880
nothing goes wrong with

02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:57.880
the video service in the future, but

02:28:57.880 --> 02:28:59.880
I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed

02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:01.880
on that, so.

02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:03.880
I'm sorry,

02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:05.880
I didn't mean it. No, that's right.

02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:07.880
I know you say you didn't want to get into too many of the

02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:09.880
details, but I'm kind of curious because I know you

02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:11.880
they were putting, I mean, it sounds like in

02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:13.880
the end, you got what you

02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:15.880
really needed

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:17.880
and deserved back. I mean, it sounds like

02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:19.880
it had to be a very manual process

02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:21.880
for Sony, so it sounds like they almost weren't set up

02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:23.880
to handle a request like yours, but

02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:25.880
I'm kind of curious, how did you ultimately

02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:27.880
kind of get them to come

02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:29.880
around, because you were going back and forth with them.

02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:31.880
If you go back a few episodes in the show when you were first calling

02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:33.880
in about this, you were going back and forth

02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:35.880
with Sony a little bit, and we told you

02:29:35.880 --> 02:29:37.880
you might have to speak with the supervisor or just kind of

02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:39.880
put up a stink. I mean, is that what ultimately

02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:41.880
happened? You sadly had to be

02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:43.880
that guy on the phone in order for them to finally

02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:45.880
listen to you?

02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:47.880
This time around,

02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:49.880
not to the same extent,

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:51.880
although I did

02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:53.880
keep what you and Dr.

02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:55.880
Zirk said in

02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:57.880
mind the initial time I

02:29:57.880 --> 02:29:59.880
hit this problem,

02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:01.880
and initially

02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:03.880
it looked like I was going to have to go that road

02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:05.880
because the first person I spoke to

02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:07.880
said

02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:09.880
to sum it up,

02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:11.880
sorry dude,

02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:13.880
you're so low on that,

02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:15.880
but

02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:17.880
in subsequent calls

02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:19.880
speaking to other reps

02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:21.880
prior to me saying I'm a machine

02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:23.880
and they said, yeah, once you send the machine

02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:25.880
in and they send it

02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:27.880
back to me,

02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:29.880
they'll do everything and reauthorize

02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:31.880
everything to download.

02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:33.880
You know,

02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:35.880
I just have to interject here,

02:30:35.880 --> 02:30:37.880
because as someone who has worked very closely

02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:39.880
with call centers in their

02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:41.880
day job, to me

02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:43.880
that's a huge issue that you

02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:45.880
called in two times and got two different

02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:47.880
answers. And for anybody,

02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:49.880
you know, Sony's a big company and who knows

02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:51.880
we might have somebody at Sony who happens to listen to

02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:53.880
this program. To me, that's a big issue.

02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:55.880
You should not call a call center, speak to two

02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:57.880
different people and get two different answers.

02:30:57.880 --> 02:30:59.880
I agree with that. I actually did customer

02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:01.880
service for a very long time and I did

02:31:01.880 --> 02:31:03.880
well

02:31:03.880 --> 02:31:05.880
by the time the department was called Service Quality where we

02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:07.880
if they had a question they could

02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:09.880
call us and ask us and we would tell them

02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:11.880
and make sure you repeat this.

02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:13.880
But yeah, everyone is supposed to be

02:31:13.880 --> 02:31:15.880
on the same page. And don't get me wrong,

02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:17.880
I'm glad Spazinator got what he

02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:19.880
wanted. He just should have gotten it the first

02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:21.880
time. You know, so this is if

02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:23.880
we can learn anything from this phone call, if

02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:25.880
you are at Sony, there's some

02:31:25.880 --> 02:31:27.880
edumacation to be done amongst

02:31:27.880 --> 02:31:29.880
your reps. This is also a

02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:31.880
prime example why every time

02:31:31.880 --> 02:31:33.880
you talk to someone in a call center, you write down

02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:35.880
their name, you write down the date and the time that you

02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:37.880
spoke with them and you keep a track of what

02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:39.880
you talked about. They have to keep notes too.

02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:41.880
Anyway, I know Spazinator... I'm sorry. No, that's okay.

02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:43.880
But no, it's important. Spazinator is dying to jump

02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:45.880
in here again. Sorry Spaz.

02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:47.880
Yeah, I was going to say,

02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:49.880
I never worked at a call center before.

02:31:49.880 --> 02:31:51.880
The closest thing to that is working

02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:53.880
at a grocery store, you know,

02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:55.880
at the front desk.

02:31:55.880 --> 02:31:57.880
But I basically

02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:59.880
talked about the initial

02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:01.880
response I got to like,

02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:03.880
perhaps, you know, the one

02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:05.880
rep that I usually spoke to

02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:07.880
having an off day,

02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:09.880
you know, every deal with

02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:11.880
Apple customers, they weren't

02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:13.880
quite as friendly as I was

02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:15.880
or maybe possibly

02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:17.880
you know,

02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:19.880
the rep

02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:21.880
possibly having some kind of

02:32:21.880 --> 02:32:23.880
bad information or gainer

02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:25.880
information mixed up somehow.

02:32:25.880 --> 02:32:27.880
But ultimately, regardless

02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:29.880
of, you know, what the case

02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:31.880
may be, you know, ultimately

02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:33.880
I got my stuff back, which is

02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:35.880
the key thing there.

02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:37.880
So, you know,

02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:39.880
if, God forbid,

02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:41.880
I kept gaining the same

02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:43.880
response time and time again,

02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:45.880
then I would, you know,

02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:47.880
escalate the call to

02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:49.880
a supervisor like U3

02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:51.880
has suggested

02:32:51.880 --> 02:32:53.880
the first time this kind of

02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:55.880
thing happened.

02:32:55.880 --> 02:32:57.880
So basically you didn't come to that, but,

02:32:57.880 --> 02:32:59.880
you know,

02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:01.880
God forbid it.

02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:03.880
Yeah, no, I was just going to say, yay Sony

02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:05.880
for getting it right, but, you know,

02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:07.880
it is a bummer that it did take you

02:33:07.880 --> 02:33:09.880
a little bit of a run around to do it, but, you know,

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:11.880
they made it right and we should recognize

02:33:11.880 --> 02:33:13.880
that, you know, at least it wasn't the doom and gloom

02:33:13.880 --> 02:33:15.880
we thought it was going to be. But I'm

02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:17.880
fascinated. I got to wrap up because we got to see if we can

02:33:17.880 --> 02:33:19.880
fit in one or two more calls. Do you have anything else

02:33:19.880 --> 02:33:21.880
or a footnote to this or anything else you want to share with

02:33:21.880 --> 02:33:23.880
listeners?

02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:25.880
Nothing comes to mind, but I'll keep

02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:27.880
you guys posted on

02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:29.880
Twitter if there's anything that comes up

02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:31.880
or if I think anything

02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:33.880
early during the week.

02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:35.880
Sounds good buddy.

02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:37.880
Alright, good luck with everything. Take care

02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:39.880
buddy.

02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:41.880
I just got to read this comment from chat, which is interesting.

02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:43.880
SHA100Matt says, I'll say this again,

02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:45.880
buy and have hard copies of your movies

02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:47.880
from now on. This is the second time that's happened

02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:49.880
and if you ask me it's totally not worth it going through this

02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:51.880
hassle. You know,

02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:53.880
it's tough because there's a lot about digital

02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:55.880
distribution I do want to support, but you know,

02:33:55.880 --> 02:33:57.880
SHA100Matt makes a good point. It's like

02:33:57.880 --> 02:33:59.880
if there were hard copies, you wouldn't have had to

02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:01.880
go through this in the first place, but

02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:03.880
I don't know.

02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:05.880
I don't know. I'm kind of torn because like, you know,

02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:07.880
I've bought things online. I've done the digital

02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:09.880
distribution thing, but I've kind of taken

02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:11.880
a lot of that for granted maybe. Alright.

02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:13.880
I just buy TV episodes sometimes online, like

02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:15.880
if I'm buying on Supernatural. That's why I like

02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:17.880
Netflix because Netflix, you know, you're not really

02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:19.880
buying anything. You just kind of rent it.

02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:21.880
Anyhow, let's do at least one more call here and then we're going to be on our way out.

02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:23.880
Hey, Aaron Orange on the radio. Who's this?

02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:25.880
Hi. This is your friendly neighborhood

02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:27.880
Mexican. Act Deaf. Hey, Act Deaf.

02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:29.880
I'm glad to see you weren't shaken

02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:31.880
too bad by the earthquake that happened last

02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:33.880
week right before the show.

02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:35.880
Yeah, we were shaken, but

02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:37.880
not stirred. Not stirred. Alright.

02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:39.880
Well said. What's

02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:41.880
on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:43.880
I just wanted to add about

02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:45.880
the Twitter topic I sent

02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:47.880
earlier about the Mexican

02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:49.880
game being

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.880
developed and brought over

02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:53.880
by Konami.

02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:55.880
I just wanted to add that

02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:57.880
it's being distributed here

02:34:57.880 --> 02:34:59.880
in Mexico, but it's

02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:01.880
being distributed by another company.

02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:03.880
Okay, well that's good to know

02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:05.880
because I think earlier I had said, oh haha, it's not

02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:07.880
coming out of Mexico even though it's a Mexican game, but

02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:09.880
that's just, Konami's not

02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:11.880
putting it out there. Someone else is. Okay, that makes sense.

02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:13.880
Yeah, it's actually made by

02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:15.880
Colombian and Mexican

02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:17.880
developers. It's being published

02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:19.880
I think by

02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:21.880
well, developed by

02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:23.880
well, the

02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:25.880
sorry.

02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:27.880
The main development is being held

02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:29.880
here in Mexico, though Colombia is

02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:31.880
helping also over their

02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:33.880
studios. I don't remember

02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:35.880
the name of the development company, but

02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:37.880
it's just starting

02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:39.880
right now to develop games

02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:41.880
and I hope, I really hope that

02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:43.880
this game

02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:45.880
at least develops or

02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:47.880
brings a market over Mexico

02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:49.880
because it's a

02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:51.880
very small market and it's

02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:53.880
starting right now.

02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:55.880
I was going to say, I can't say

02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:57.880
and maybe you can correct me here, but I can't say I can

02:35:57.880 --> 02:35:59.880
think of any like big games or even

02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:01.880
medium sized games that we can say

02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:03.880
this game was developed in Mexico by

02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:05.880
a Mexican company or

02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:07.880
Colombia or any of these other places.

02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:09.880
This seems to be like the first game we're really

02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:11.880
at least that I'm aware of

02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:13.880
that is developed like that.

02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:15.880
Yeah, there's not

02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:17.880
really a market for like

02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:19.880
Xbox 360 or PS3

02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:21.880
games, maybe even Wii games

02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:23.880
that are developed

02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:25.880
at least this large.

02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:27.880
There may be cell phone games

02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:29.880
that are being developed here

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:31.880
and are made by companies like

02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:33.880
Gameloft and other

02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:35.880
companies, but

02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:37.880
for a console

02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:39.880
it's pretty much the first.

02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:41.880
There are

02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:43.880
games coming out for

02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:45.880
the Wii and the 360

02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:47.880
that are also

02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:49.880
based on Mexican

02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:51.880
franchises like

02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:53.880
soap opera even,

02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:55.880
but at least it's starting to

02:36:55.880 --> 02:36:57.880
grow. Do you see PS2 development?

02:36:57.880 --> 02:36:59.880
Because my thought would be that a lot of these countries

02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:01.880
that they're not really being supported

02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:03.880
with the 360 and PS3, it seems that maybe

02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:05.880
the PS2 is still big there.

02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:07.880
Actually,

02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:09.880
the PS2 isn't

02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:11.880
that big right now.

02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:13.880
It's maybe the PS3 or

02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:15.880
the 360 maybe.

02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:17.880
Maybe on other places

02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:19.880
like Brazil

02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:21.880
and especially

02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:23.880
because of their import

02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:25.880
and taxes over there,

02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:27.880
the PS2 is starting to gain

02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:29.880
momentum there, but

02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:31.880
here, even though

02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:33.880
the games, and I have talked about this before,

02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:35.880
the games are pretty expensive, but

02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:37.880
at least we're on the

02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:39.880
same market as America.

02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:41.880
You mentioned

02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:43.880
Brazil and the first thing I thought of was

02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:45.880
I thought the Master System was still big in Brazil.

02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:47.880
Yeah, it's still big.

02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:49.880
It's like, whoa.

02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:51.880
They also have the re-releases. Didn't we have a story

02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:53.880
about the Genesis repackaging that was coming

02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:55.880
out in Brazil? There's some

02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:57.880
interesting things going on with old school games

02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:59.880
in Latin America.

02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:01.880
If I recall correctly, it's called

02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:03.880
the Bebo.

02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:05.880
It was brought over here

02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:07.880
in Mexico, though it didn't.

02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:09.880
It wasn't as big

02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:11.880
as in Brazil. Interesting.

02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:13.880
Cool stuff. Well, we hope

02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:15.880
the game does well. I know

02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:17.880
it's probably not going to be a huge thing

02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:19.880
here, but I know there's a lot of people that are

02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:21.880
really into that Mexican wrestling stuff and

02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:23.880
just like there are the WWE

02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:25.880
and all that stuff, so I'm sure

02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:27.880
it will definitely have its audience.

02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:29.880
It doesn't look that bad.

02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:31.880
It looks decent.

02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:33.880
I totally love Mexican wrestling.

02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:35.880
I've played some of the WWE games, and

02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:37.880
they look good, and it looks

02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:39.880
at the same part.

02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:41.880
Alright, well, we'll see. We'll hope it does well.

02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:43.880
At least if nothing else, it'll help the

02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:45.880
development market down there and get some more

02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:47.880
games out of there of some ideas.

02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:49.880
Anything else you want to share with the listeners

02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:51.880
real quick tonight, ACT-F?

02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:53.880
Well, only that

02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:55.880
we're okay over here in

02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:57.880
Nezcali. Even though it

02:38:57.880 --> 02:38:59.880
was a pretty big quake, there was

02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:01.880
only pretty much

02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:03.880
structural damages.

02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:05.880
There were only two lives lost

02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:07.880
and only a couple

02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:09.880
hundred injuries, but

02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:11.880
other

02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:13.880
than that, we're pretty fine over here,

02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:15.880
though there are people that

02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:17.880
are needed

02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:19.880
of services and maybe

02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.880
like camping tents

02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:23.880
and all that stuff, but

02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:27.880
other than that, we're pretty

02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:29.880
good. Hopefully,

02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:31.880
at least here in America,

02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:33.880
the folks want to donate to

02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:35.880
the relief efforts. I'm sure

02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:37.880
the Red Cross has something set up. They always do

02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:39.880
for the cases like this, so definitely

02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:41.880
folks should look into that. I'm glad

02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:43.880
to hear that for the most part, everything's okay.

02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:45.880
It's sad

02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:47.880
that even one life was lost, but

02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:49.880
it sounds like it could have been a lot

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.880
worse based on how bad

02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:53.880
the quake itself was, so

02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:55.880
I'm glad to hear that at least

02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:57.880
you and everyone you care

02:39:57.880 --> 02:39:59.880
about are okay.

02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:01.880
All right, well, Act F, we're

02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:03.880
going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call, okay?

02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:05.880
Thank you. All right, take care, my friend.

02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:07.880
All right,

02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:09.880
that's going to do it for tonight's calls, and sorry

02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:11.880
for those folks that didn't get through.

02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:13.880
It was ringing pretty good tonight because

02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:15.880
we actually had

02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:17.880
a lot of people that were trying to get in

02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:19.880
tonight because of last week, but

02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:21.880
yeah, we've got to wrap it up, you guys.

02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:23.880
I'm starting

02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:25.880
a new job tomorrow. I can't be here all night,

02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:27.880
and you know, Dark Soccer wants to go to bed

02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:29.880
eventually, and Matt might

02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:31.880
want to go back to KFC and ask for a double down

02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:33.880
with no sauce, so we'll see.

02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:35.880
All right. I'm kind of hungry because I didn't

02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:37.880
need anything. I offered to make ribs.

02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:39.880
You can have cake. I don't need ribs.

02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:41.880
I'm going to have healthy special

02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:43.880
K cereal when I go home. All right.

02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:45.880
Anyhow, we've got to wrap

02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:47.880
up, you guys, and get on out of here

02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:49.880
so we can. Ooh, or a baked potato. I'm going to have

02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:51.880
a baked potato.

02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:53.880
All right. We've got to, uh-oh.

02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:55.880
Uh-oh. We have a stream

02:40:55.880 --> 02:40:57.880
down error. Winamp has crashed.

02:40:57.880 --> 02:40:59.880
God dammit.

02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:01.880
All right. That's okay. We're going to just keep going here.

02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:03.880
At least it's at the end of the show.

02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:05.880
Yeah, at least it's at the end of the show.

02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:07.880
Hold on, guys. Dang it.

02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:09.880
Poopy!

02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:11.880
All right. We're still recording for podcasts,

02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:13.880
so can someone fill a little time here

02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:15.880
while I get us... I'm actually trying to find something to send

02:41:15.880 --> 02:41:17.880
you for cage match. Okay, that's fine.

02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:19.880
And, um...

02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:21.880
I had the same problem, but then I found something.

02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:23.880
Well, I was

02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:25.880
going to... Who was the winning song last time?

02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:27.880
That would be, I think, you, Rob.

02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:29.880
Was I with the Goldfrapp song? It wasn't me.

02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:31.880
Yeah, you were with the Goldfrapp song. Okay, that's fine.

02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:33.880
So I was going to do, like, a throwaway.

02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:35.880
Okay, there we go. So we're still going.

02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:37.880
Now we're back up, and it's streaming on all games again.

02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:39.880
I don't know what happened. So, okay.

02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:41.880
Now we can actually wrap up the show. Winamp froze,

02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:43.880
you guys. I don't know why it does that.

02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:45.880
It's irritating. Because it's Winamp.

02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:47.880
I guess. I mean, it might need to upgrade the version

02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:49.880
or something. We'll have to run some tests.

02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:51.880
You need to upgrade your version.

02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:53.880
We'll have to run some tests before the next show, I don't know.

02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:55.880
But that's weird, because just closing

02:41:55.880 --> 02:41:57.880
Skype shouldn't bork Winamp like that.

02:41:57.880 --> 02:41:59.880
I don't know what happened. Alright, well

02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:01.880
it is what it is. Anyhow, um...

02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:03.880
We're still going to wrap up

02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:05.880
and be on out of here for the night.

02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:07.880
Thanks so much for our Skype callers. Thank you guys

02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:09.880
for listening to our show and supporting our

02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:11.880
independent radio. I gotta get

02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:13.880
last minute stories, though, before I give my whole spiel here.

02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:15.880
It looks like Matt has a million tabs open on

02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:17.880
Firefox over there. Yes, I do.

02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:19.880
A million instances of the Unicorn game.

02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:21.880
DarkSire, do you have any last minute stories

02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:23.880
real quick before we go?

02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:25.880
Rawr. I just want to check.

02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:27.880
Alright, Loki then.

02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:29.880
Ok, so Dark Void Zero, that

02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:31.880
wonderful 2D version

02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:33.880
of, or 8-bit 2D version

02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:35.880
of the game Dark Zero

02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:37.880
that hit the DSiWare

02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:39.880
is now going to be hitting the iPhone

02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:41.880
and PC actually tomorrow.

02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:43.880
So that's pretty awesome.

02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:45.880
And it'll cost you $2.99

02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:47.880
on the iPhone and $5 on PC.

02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:49.880
So that's not bad. I actually may purchase that for my

02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:51.880
arcade cabinet. I think that would fit in just

02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:53.880
nice and easy.

02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:55.880
And a game that I was playing earlier

02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:57.880
this week.

02:42:57.880 --> 02:42:59.880
I always had trouble pronouncing this.

02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:01.880
Espacaluda 2

02:43:01.880 --> 02:43:03.880
will be hitting the iPhone as well.

02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:05.880
Also, actually

02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:07.880
it should have already hit the iPhone because that would have been

02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:09.880
on the 10th.

02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:11.880
That's awesome.

02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:13.880
My friend linked

02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:15.880
a Japanese video of that in and I

02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:17.880
was actually already looking for it.

02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:19.880
But I don't know that...

02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:21.880
I don't know how well I controlled it on the iPhone.

02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:23.880
It looked pretty responsive

02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:25.880
on that video. So I'm totally thinking

02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:27.880
about getting it.

02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:29.880
Very cool.

02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:31.880
Let's see here. And then

02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:33.880
there's some interesting

02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:35.880
tie-ins apparently with Melgir Solid

02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:37.880
Peace Walker.

02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:39.880
They're going to have two different games

02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:41.880
tie-in with it. First one, Monster Hunter

02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:43.880
is actually

02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:45.880
going to be tie-in with it as well.

02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:47.880
Monster Hunter Portable 2nd-G

02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:49.880
I guess

02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:51.880
there's going to be content from that game

02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:53.880
that's going to be able to

02:43:53.880 --> 02:43:55.880
work with Peace Walker

02:43:55.880 --> 02:43:57.880
which is weird.

02:43:57.880 --> 02:43:59.880
Apparently the little

02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:01.880
cat-like characters

02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:03.880
the felines

02:44:03.880 --> 02:44:05.880
that appear in the Monster Hunter series

02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:07.880
are going to appear

02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:09.880
in the Melgir Solid Peace Walker

02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:11.880
game as well.

02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:13.880
So that's interesting.

02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:15.880
And then another weird one

02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:17.880
that's a crossover. Apparently

02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:19.880
you will also be able to link up

02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:21.880
Melgir Solid

02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:23.880
Peace Walker with

02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:25.880
Front Mission Evolved

02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:27.880
on the Playstation 3 and

02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:29.880
Xbox 360. Players will be able

02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:31.880
to exchange parts acquired from

02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:33.880
Peace Walker bosses

02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:35.880
in Front Mission Evolved.

02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:37.880
How the hell does that work?

02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:39.880
But that's interesting.

02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:41.880
And you can use them for your

02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:43.880
mechs that you build in that game.

02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:45.880
Talk about cross-company

02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:47.880
promotions there. That's kind of neat

02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:49.880
actually. I actually want to

02:44:49.880 --> 02:44:51.880
check out that new Peace Walker game.

02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:53.880
Or Front Mission.

02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:55.880
And then Professor Layton

02:44:55.880 --> 02:44:57.880
is actually coming over here. It's getting a Western

02:44:57.880 --> 02:44:59.880
release. The movie that is

02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:01.880
developed by

02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:03.880
Level 5 and

02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:05.880
that looks kind of neat.

02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:07.880
An anime movie.

02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:09.880
People will dig that.

02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:11.880
And of course with any

02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:13.880
game out there with voluptuous

02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:15.880
women, there will be

02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:17.880
a way that they will find to strip them

02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:19.880
of their clothes. And

02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:21.880
that was the

02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:23.880
exact thing that happened

02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:25.880
with Dead or Alive Paradise.

02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:27.880
People have found a way to

02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:29.880
swap out the

02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:31.880
textures in the game and now we get

02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:33.880
wonderful, nippleous,

02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:35.880
naked women. I'm sure it wasn't very hard with a

02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:37.880
Dead or Alive game. So yeah, that game is

02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:39.880
five bucks on iTunes and I'm buying it right now.

02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:41.880
Espagluta?

02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:43.880
Yes.

02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:45.880
Good luck controlling it on the iPhone.

02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:47.880
Just not my favorite

02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:49.880
gaming platform.

02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:51.880
And then finally, there was a patent

02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:53.880
file for Rumble

02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:55.880
in DS. I'm assuming

02:45:55.880 --> 02:45:57.880
it's going to be in the 3DS.

02:45:57.880 --> 02:45:59.880
Oh, I'm sure. Yeah, I think there's been

02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:01.880
rumblings of Rumble for quite some time.

02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:03.880
Yeah.

02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:05.880
And hopefully dual analog sticks would be

02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:07.880
nice. It would be great.

02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:09.880
Because everybody likes dual analog sticks.

02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:11.880
I'm not going to hold my breath though.

02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:13.880
I got a couple things thrown at me here in chat.

02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:15.880
SSG100Matt reminded

02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:17.880
me that I don't think we ever mentioned the winner

02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:19.880
of USL Madness or

02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:21.880
the March Madness, if you will, that happens

02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:23.880
on Orange on its Radio. I think we were off the week it

02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:25.880
ended and then of course last week's show was just

02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:27.880
off. Chrono Trigger

02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:29.880
1 for the first time

02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:31.880
was the declared the greatest game of all time

02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:33.880
by your voting

02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:35.880
at OrangeOnitsRadio.com. I

02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:37.880
thoroughly disagree with your votes

02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:39.880
but whatever. I mean it's not like Chrono Trigger is a bad game.

02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:41.880
But I guess it was destined to win one of

02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:43.880
these years. I've just decided

02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:45.880
in these contests, people just vote the way

02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:47.880
I don't vote.

02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:49.880
And I don't know if it's a ha ha

02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:51.880
let's make Rob mad or whatever, but whatever.

02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:53.880
I can think of a lot of games

02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:55.880
a lot of games worse than

02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:57.880
Chrono Trigger. Yay Chrono Trigger

02:46:57.880 --> 02:46:59.880
and yay everybody that participated in

02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:01.880
boo and poop on those that didn't.

02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:03.880
And also as Tigerclaw points out Microsoft

02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:05.880
has changed the increments of which you have to

02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:07.880
purchase Microsoft points to more

02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:09.880
manageable numbers

02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:11.880
instead of some weird rounded off numbers.

02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:13.880
It's actually four hundred and eight hundred

02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:15.880
and sixteen hundred and four thousand.

02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:17.880
Is it really? Yes. I'd heard that they were doing

02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:19.880
that so they got rid of five hundred one thousand

02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:21.880
and all that all together? Yeah.

02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:23.880
Well shit, now what if I have extra points I want to use?

02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:25.880
Am I screwed?

02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:27.880
It's like go get a card at the store?

02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:29.880
I don't know. Tigerclaw

02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:31.880
is cut and paste in tons of links for us.

02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:33.880
He also posted a link that I think is worth mentioning.

02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:35.880
Blockbuster, you know Blockbuster

02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:37.880
is kind of hurting right now. They're closing stores left

02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:39.880
and right. One of the things they're trying to

02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:41.880
do to, I guess you could say either compete

02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:43.880
with Netflix or Gamefly or both.

02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:45.880
They are doing their games

02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:47.880
by mail service. It's going to

02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:49.880
cost an extra seven ninety nine

02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:51.880
plus tax on top of the standard

02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:53.880
I guess you could say monthly fees.

02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:55.880
You'll be able to rent one game

02:47:55.880 --> 02:47:57.880
at a time and that's the total number

02:47:57.880 --> 02:47:59.880
of discs that you're allowed to have out on the plan.

02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:01.880
So there you go. If you don't check

02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:03.880
any games out during the one month period though

02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:05.880
you're not charged the money. Kind of interesting

02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:07.880
how that all works. It's currently being

02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:09.880
tested in Cleveland, Ohio.

02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:11.880
Because Cleveland rocks.

02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:13.880
Cleveland rocks. Ohio.

02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:15.880
I'm thinking actually

02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:17.880
you say that I think of Howard the Duck.

02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:19.880
You live in Cleveland.

02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:21.880
Drew Carey show.

02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:23.880
I don't watch that.

02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:25.880
It was like ten years ago.

02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:27.880
I didn't watch that.

02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:29.880
They even had a Rocky Horror themed episode.

02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:31.880
I did see that.

02:48:31.880 --> 02:48:33.880
Well, see. Wait, how did you not watch the show

02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:35.880
yet? See that episode. I saw the clip

02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:37.880
on YouTube. Yeah, YouTube. YouTube

02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:39.880
it ruins everything. Alright.

02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:41.880
Anyhow, I think we're done. Is that it?

02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:43.880
Did you get all your stories, Logie?

02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:45.880
Yeah, all the ones I wanted to.

02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:47.880
Some guy beat some Asteroids record too.

02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:49.880
Hey now, don't haze

02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:51.880
Tiger Claw in chat.

02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:53.880
This is the Tiger Claw link show.

02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:55.880
He does a good job. Act F says Tiger Claw

02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:57.880
more efficient than Google. Seriously.

02:48:57.880 --> 02:48:59.880
And Dan Mufroga Returns is apparently

02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:01.880
popping up on DSiWare as well.

02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:03.880
Cannot die.

02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:05.880
Cannot die. This is why I like

02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:07.880
doing a show with a live chat room because when

02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:09.880
I don't know the answer instead of sitting here looking like an idiot

02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:11.880
or making something up. I mean I still look like an idiot.

02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:13.880
But I'll just go, hey chat, what was

02:49:13.880 --> 02:49:15.880
the answer to that? Somebody always knows.

02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:17.880
And if it involves a link, Tiger Claw has it

02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:19.880
in five seconds. If not, SSA 100

02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:21.880
Matt. It's like a little friendly competition.

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:23.880
We should have a total board.

02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:25.880
Or something.

02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:27.880
Alright, anyhow.

02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:29.880
Of course, thank you guys so much. All the chatters

02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:31.880
that help make the show happen. You guys really are

02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:33.880
the fourth guest on the show always.

02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:35.880
And of course, you guys for listening. I know we have a lot

02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:37.880
of people on the podcast who just can't be here for

02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:39.880
whatever reason Sunday night. So thank you guys so much

02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:41.880
for downloading our show and tuning in and supporting

02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:43.880
independent radio. You guys are awesome.

02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:45.880
And thanks so much. Always say

02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:47.880
if you enjoy the show, just tell somebody

02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:49.880
about the show.

02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:51.880
Or leave a nice review on iTunes or

02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:53.880
some other podcast site. Just help us spread the word

02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:55.880
because we don't have a big magazine

02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:57.880
or a big million dollar website or game

02:49:57.880 --> 02:49:59.880
company behind us. We're just

02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:01.880
kids like you that like video games.

02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:03.880
Except we're not kids anymore.

02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:05.880
That's the sad part.

02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:07.880
Anyhow, that's going to do it for another episode of

02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:09.880
Orange Lounge Radio. But not until we go around to get everybody's

02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:11.880
final thought. DarkSakura, do you have

02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:13.880
a final thought for us tonight?

02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:15.880
Meh. Cake!

02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:17.880
Loki, do you have a final thought

02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:19.880
for us tonight? I'm hoping to finish Final Fantasy

02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:21.880
13 soon. Although I have a feeling

02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:23.880
I'm not going to be able to because I have to get all the

02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:25.880
achievements. And I have lots

02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:27.880
of games to start playing.

02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:29.880
My final thought

02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:31.880
is the website

02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:33.880
ffxivcore.com

02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:35.880
is making me foam at the mouth.

02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:37.880
That's really what it boils

02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:39.880
down to. Anyhow,

02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:41.880
thank you guys again. Have a great week.

02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:43.880
We will be back next week with more

02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:45.880
of Orange Lounge Radio to do this all over

02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:47.880
again. New

02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:49.880
stories and all that other stuff.

02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:51.880
But the same old crap that you've

02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:53.880
come to love week to week. We'll

02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:55.880
see you next time here on Orange

02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:57.880
Lounge

02:50:57.880 --> 02:50:59.880
Radio.

02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:01.880
Of course it would help if I would have the

02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:03.880
end of the show theme song queued up.

02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:05.880
Because when I don't have that I just

02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:07.880
sit here in silence and it's kind of awkward.

02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:09.880
Much better. Here we go. Good night!

02:51:37.880 --> 02:51:39.880
See you next week!
