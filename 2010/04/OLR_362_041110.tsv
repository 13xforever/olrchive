20882	24003	And an old classic game needs a Latin translation.
27785	36989	Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 362 of Orange Lounge Radio.
37389	40410	The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
40530	46433	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46693	48654	For a moment it sounded like you were using a porn voice.
48954	49394	Yeah.
49634	51134	Awful and in a bag.
78772	79673	Thanks for watching!
97256	105339	KFC, but he usually brings chicken to the show, that's no surprise, but he didn't just bring any old KFC tonight, oh no, he brought a Double Down to the show with him.
106259	110881	For those that don't know what a Double Down is, Loki, please quickly define, what is the Double Down from KFC?
111241	120405	It's a new sandwich from KFC that just launched today, I think, and it's basically, instead of having some sort of bread holding a sandwich together,
120905	123048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
138786	139327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
157023	157544	It's awful.
157564	160606	So, if you do get double down, don't get it with the cheese sauce.
160706	162848	Otherwise, it'll probably be good without it.
162888	168913	I mean, seriously, the strips themselves, it's all white meat, and so it's healthy for you.
168933	170074	No, just kidding.
170095	170575	It's not healthy.
171195	172857	You can get it grilled, though.
173858	176120	That's going to really help with all the cheese on it.
176460	182045	I think, though, that if you got it grilled, well, it actually would be perfect for anyone doing a low-carb diet, though.
182948	191899	I guess, but honestly, if I want to eat healthy, quote-unquote, at KFC, I would probably get, like, a two-piece meal grilled with, like, mashed potatoes, no gravy or something.
191919	193641	I know.
194042	195424	I was just being funny.
195604	197606	Or I probably wouldn't go to KFC at all.
197666	198988	I would probably just eat a fruit salad.
199008	200550	I just was going to see if they had the Double Down.
200570	201731	They did, so I got it.
202512	205773	I was sorely disappointed with that cheese sauce.
205913	210475	I figured, okay, it's just going to be something that tastes like cheese, but it's like a melted consistency.
210535	213156	But no, they had to spice it up with ranch or something.
213876	219398	It's just gross, and it's overpowering the entire sandwich or whatever it is.
219678	220639	I could smell it from over here.
221539	226441	So that's so unfortunate because I had high hopes for that, but oh well.
227102	229644	I actually have a challenge for everybody for next month.
229944	230284	What's that?
230965	232946	No fast food for a month.
234347	234787	Good luck.
235908	237890	I've been... No, I've done it before.
237910	239971	That was the first fast food I've had in two weeks.
240131	242153	It's not dinner that I have a problem with.
242193	242933	That's really easy.
242953	244194	It's lunch at work.
244334	245275	It's really hard.
245455	247637	Especially when I only have had a three-minute lunch.
247697	250599	But I'm starting a new job this coming week, which is exciting.
250679	252000	I will tell you... Day job.
252640	273599	My BFF, Becky, we have three days out of the week, we walk during lunch, and we bring our own lunch, and I have this huge mungus thermos thing, but the dollar store, Rob, is selling those cubes, those frozen cube things that you can put in a thermal container, so...
274479	296445	I was, but no, it was something I was actually wanting to do is do the one month fast food free challenge and then for a, you know, it's like average how many times you want would normally go out for fast food and then, you know, put like the money that you normally would have spent on like a Happy Meal or something aside and donate it to charity at the end of the month.
296485	297205	Questions from chat.
297245	299046	Zappy says, does Subway count as fast food?
301668	302870	What defines fast food?
302990	303951	I'll make a list.
315069	321614	Basically, okay, if it's a sandwich, you know, that's, if it looks unhealthy, it probably is fast food.
321654	322395	Why don't you say this?
322415	326458	I would say the types like McDonald's and Sonic, I love Sonic.
326498	329941	Or do something like, maybe this, we're getting way off topic of video games.
329961	332403	If they serve hamburgers or tacos, they're fast food.
332523	335705	Or maybe if you, fast food is okay if you can keep it 10 grams of fat or less.
336566	336866	I don't know.
337226	339708	Because like at Subway, it's really easy to do 10 grams of fat or less.
339728	341830	Well, I don't really, okay, this is the thing.
342090	342230	Hmm.
343511	353377	Almost any of these, I'm talking about just like the really highly processed food, you know what I mean?
354518	358980	I include KFC in this too because their chicken is just a gene bait.
361582	370907	But like, seriously, I'm giving it to start in May because I know it is, for a lot of people it's a habit to change.
371872	375215	Let's try to tie it in with some type of Wii Fit or DDR or something.
375235	376076	That's what I was thinking.
376356	381622	If you rub the food on a piece of paper and it turns transparent, then it's probably fast food.
381642	382302	The food and the paper.
382382	382663	All right.
383744	385505	We got to get back to a video YouTuber.
385545	388508	Listeners, help give us ideas and we'll formulate a contest.
388749	388969	All right.
389029	392412	No, but seriously, though, this is the first soda and first fast food I've had in two weeks.
392632	394214	I had my first soda today.
394605	396206	That's only because I want to try the Double Down.
397886	403788	Technically, I ate very few calories because I only had two bites of that in Minnesota.
404829	406729	I'm doing good still.
408070	410011	What grade would you give the KFC Double Down?
411411	418134	I would give it probably a D just because the cheese sauce.
418294	420834	If it was at the cheese sauce, I would have probably given it a B.
422435	427940	The Double Down gets a D here on Orange Lounge Mornings on KL Games.
428040	432724	Like it needs like American cheese melted on there instead of the cheese sauce and it might be good.
433024	436507	Once in a while we talk about video games here on the program at Orange Lounge Radio.
437068	441672	Hey, if you want to pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, of course, chat at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
441692	445775	What they need to have instead of the cheese sauce, their gravy that they have.
446676	447617	That would be perfect.
447997	448618	Okay, enough.
448918	449158	Enough.
449318	450139	No more food talk.
451431	452511	Let's talk about games.
452611	454992	DarkSakura, please tell me you've played a video game this week.
455352	456012	Rock Band.
456973	459513	A fuck ton of Rock Band last night for my party.
460994	463534	What was the best beer at your beer potluck, out of curiosity?
464155	464995	What was the best one?
465415	466335	The one that I brought, of course.
467135	467516	I'm just kidding.
467776	468456	You know what, Rob?
468476	471337	I've actually saved that chocolate beer for an occasion.
472717	474718	And Dan's like, they bring you, what's this?
474898	475298	Peach?
475598	475678	What?
476570	476890	What?
477271	477691	It's good.
479033	482037	I like the Black Current one, but I've had tons of their different ones before.
482057	483879	I haven't tried the Peach yet, but I love the Black Current.
484380	492249	But the Young's is going to be... I'm going to be having one every night when I get back from school.
492810	493010	Nice.
493230	496014	That's going to be my I'm not in school beer.
497472	499533	There's still so much beer in my fridge, really.
500833	502434	I wasn't really going to drink any.
502794	505035	It's totally my fault, but we went from food to beer.
505315	506795	And just totally dodged the games.
507015	508336	Oh yeah, by the way, Rock Band.
508596	509056	Beer!
513477	514278	Totally my fault.
514318	515098	I enabled it.
515178	519720	I had a Guinness, a couple of Newcastles, about three fat tires.
522640	524161	Clearly she was playing Tapper.
524281	526942	Two Killian's Reds.
528587	532531	I did... Heather brought the Sierra Nevada, but I really don't like Sierra Nevada, like, at all.
534252	539858	And... And then I was gonna go... I actually was... I picked up the four-pack.
540418	545303	I was like, I'm gonna have... Can't drink any more beer!
547065	547785	I had no voice.
547865	548966	My throat still hurts today.
549807	550548	And there was rock band?
550925	551765	It was a lot of rock band.
551925	553066	All day, rock band.
553766	557427	We stopped long enough for Dan to play Outrun.
558308	567751	And then him and one of my co-workers that showed up played... It was either him... No, I think he played with my friend Gary.
567771	570912	Anyway, they were playing Bad Dudes.
572403	573083	What kind of cake?
573103	573963	Chocolate and carrot.
596917	597377	DarkSakura.com
622662	624023	That sounds like a fun project.
625144	627105	Should I just pitch the show for the Food Network?
627185	629646	I mean, should we leave all games and be on a more appropriate network?
629666	632168	No, I have tons of game stuff I could talk about.
632768	633609	I'm just waiting.
633709	634529	Add three cakes.
637071	639232	One of them is gluten-free, though, so I will be taking some to work.
639352	640353	So Cake Mania.
640753	641894	I'm going to get cake right now.
643857	644237	Loki.
645278	653043	Here I thought this week's show would be better than the train wreck that was last week, but clearly I was underestimating the ability of this program.
653463	659607	Well, Loki, before you do your gaming week, I already spoiled it and said it to the listeners last week, but congratulations for you and Nellie are in order.
659687	660327	Yes, thank you.
660548	660848	Thank you.
660908	667012	Yes, she's, ironically enough today, she is as pregnant as she was when she had the twins.
667192	670454	So she is a little nervous, but less nervous today.
670934	677237	But yes, she's about 21 weeks and 4 days, I believe?
677257	678297	3 days?
679077	679717	21 weeks and 3 days.
682479	684139	One boy, we know that.
686440	687981	Everything's cool so far.
689581	690402	Anyways, so games.
690522	696224	So let me first start off with a story because this is really odd but awesome at the same time.
696924	701366	So Friday, you know, I think it was Friday.
701526	709929	Anyways, Friday, not this Friday but last Friday, I get this mysterious package in the mail.
710309	711950	I'm like, what the hell is this?
712250	712790	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
733760	735481	I don't know who we have in Austin, Texas.
735662	740025	That's not far from where Travis Donovan is, but he doesn't really like this show.
740145	741826	Wait, how did they get your address?
757799	758280	I don't know.
758300	759841	Wait, wait.
760882	762943	Doesn't that strike you as slightly creepy?
763184	766126	I don't know if I would actually be excited about the Xbox.
766186	769809	I would more be wondering, how did a listener get my home address?
770089	771070	No, it was sent to my work.
771951	772091	Oh.
772811	774493	Have you said where you work on this program before?
774733	775674	I might have at one point.
775714	776174	Weird.
776374	776715	I don't know.
776755	777696	Maybe Namco sent it.
777736	778456	They know where you work.
781696	784998	Yes, that makes perfect sense.
785759	787159	We learned that a couple of years ago.
788580	789061	Fun times.
789421	792883	No, but anyways, I'm incredibly thankful for that.
793123	799407	And, you know, I've been messing with it for, well, this last week or so.
799547	802269	Okay, but seriously, ask before you send us strange packages in the mail.
802309	803229	It's always a nice thing to do.
803289	803450	Exactly.
803550	807392	And I mean, definitely, I would, you know, that was incredible.
807472	807852	And I...
809253	811316	No, I mean, it's a very nice gesture.
811356	811816	Exactly.
812057	814159	There is a small part of me where I'm like, oh, that's awesome.
814199	814499	Like, that's 90%.
815160	817443	No, I was even like 95% awesome.
817763	820406	But 5%, like, how did they get your address?
821427	823209	I wasn't even thinking about that, honestly.
823229	824150	I was like, woohoo!
824271	824871	Yeah!
824891	825292	Yeah.
825996	828319	No, but it's been cool.
828359	832385	So I've been playing a lot of games, obviously.
833947	834448	One more thought.
834588	837792	Could it have been the guy that we sicked the OL Army on?
837973	839975	Maybe just... In Austin, Texas?
840196	841798	Would he leave the state?
842238	842519	Maybe.
844540	844920	I don't know.
847143	847724	Well, whatever.
849646	851728	So anyways, so games.
853069	854111	What did I play this week?
854231	856693	I played actually some Japanese shooters.
857634	859577	Escaluda 2.
859957	862880	I actually played that quite a bit.
863080	864382	Went through kind of the...
865643	869304	I figured I'd start off at the easy mode on there, and it's pretty fun.
869644	870404	It's a little different.
871045	876646	I haven't really played a lot of the Japanese shmup games, but it's pretty fun.
876766	878787	A lot of dodging bullets and whatnot.
879867	883128	So definitely worth checking out if they ever bring it over here.
884348	887489	Tried a little bit of Otomidius Gorgeous.
888169	894431	That game is a little weirder than I thought, but definitely has that whole Gradius vibe to it, of course.
895311	896132	But that's pretty fun.
897053	899675	And played through more Final Fantasy 13.
900336	905340	I'm now, well, I don't know if I should say Wormat because that's kind of a spoiler, I guess.
905520	909964	But I'm to the point in the game where it kind of opens up like, you know, an overworld.
909984	910905	How many hours in are you?
911525	912747	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
927762	936909	In Wind Waker, where you go under the ocean and you see Hyrule and you're like, why couldn't the whole game have been like this?
937509	939270	Why couldn't they have just done this instead?
939690	945174	Well, that's almost, to me, what this part of the game is for Final Fantasy XIII.
945654	949517	For the people that are complaining, why isn't there an overworld in this?
950337	952119	Why couldn't they have done the whole game like this?
952299	955801	Because it's basically kind of like an overworld situation.
957322	972790	at the same time there's all these side quests and stuff you can do which are kind of annoying but they're relatively easy for me I guess and the narrative's kind of moving along a little bit but I still don't know entirely what's going on but I think I'm at the end or close to the end
973210	975011	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
993018	995559	So, long story short, I've been having to adjust on the fly.
995619	1000562	So, if Loki's audio is going up and down and changing around, that's me playing on the mixing board.
1000882	1002543	So, it should be all better now, though.
1002563	1003683	I think I found where it needs to be.
1003923	1004664	Sorry, listeners.
1004684	1005864	Sorry, Loki.
1006685	1007065	So, yeah.
1007145	1008345	So, it's all right.
1008446	1009786	It's kind of neat.
1011067	1011267	But...
1012428	1024714	and and unfortunately those characters aren't real it didn't seem like they're too much like lesbians at this point in the game although there was an embrace part of the game which I was like are they gonna kiss?
1025635	1039783	I wasn't trying to go there I was trying to keep quiet on the spoilery stuff but I do think there are lesbians in Final Fantasy XIII yeah they're close we don't know how close but they're close
1040509	1041329	I think they're very close.
1042250	1042630	Just saying.
1043790	1045371	Cougar kitten thing going on there.
1047172	1049193	There is definitely a cougar kitten thing going on.
1049553	1050814	Anyway, no more spoilers.
1050854	1052354	Alright, anyways.
1053315	1054335	So yeah, it's pretty awesome.
1054555	1062138	And then... And there's a loud commercial for Lysol power toilet cleaner.
1063139	1067141	Anyways... I believe that was it as far as games, though.
1067761	1067801	Um...
1069642	1073124	Granted, you probably guys know what JTAG consoles are for.
1073624	1074404	Nothing legit.
1074604	1076565	Bobby would not approve, of course.
1078766	1083229	Let me just say there's a lot of Rock Band download content out there.
1084229	1089832	Well, I'm hoping, Loki, you're only using it to do the import games and not the shady stuff.
1091207	1092787	Import games are okay, I think.
1092887	1095808	I say import games they don't bother to release here are fair game.
1095828	1096848	That's my stance on piracy.
1098208	1106070	The only games I've ever really, really liked, just totally been hardcore pirating into would be the import stuff, especially back in the PS1 days.
1106650	1110710	Because I'm not going to pay to import games if the publisher doesn't believe in the game here.
1110750	1119512	I did install a 640 gigabyte hard drive, though, in the shell of an old 360 case, so now I can use that because JTAG consoles allow you to do that.
1120572	1121552	But it's awesome.
1121893	1123193	I like playing games from other regions.
1124233	1124513	All right.
1126494	1129035	If that's it for your gaming week, then I'll talk quickly about my gaming week.
1129055	1136398	I actually didn't play a lot of new games, just kind of a potpourri of a lot, a lot of old games this week, especially on Xbox Live Arcade.
1136798	1138899	I did play a little more Game Room, I guess I could say that.
1138979	1139839	Just a little more.
1139899	1144981	I haven't really been working on the Yars' Revenge duel with Bobby because...
1145641	1150923	Actually, Bradley, Arcadian42, who hasn't been on the show in quite some time, but he was here last night.
1150963	1152224	Randomly saw him yesterday, yes.
1152684	1160107	He has smoked both Bobby and I. I don't think Bobby can see that, but like, now I don't just have to beat Bobby, I have to beat Bradley.
1160207	1161828	And that's even, that's 130,000 points.
1161908	1168771	I actually messed a little bit with Game Room, and I noticed I got a lot of achievements really quick by just doing stuff.
1168971	1172133	You can get about 100 points doing next to nothing.
1172153	1174614	But you do have to actually play games to get more.
1175194	1180437	But I bought Crystal Castles because I had a friend over who really wanted to see Crystal.
1180457	1182758	Because they remembered it from the 80s and they really wanted to play it.
1182778	1183939	And I was like, okay.
1183979	1186240	I liked Crystal Castles enough where I'll spend the money to get it.
1186740	1187601	It's like renting a movie.
1188541	1190402	Five bucks is about how much it costs to rent a movie.
1190682	1193043	Because I buy all my games for both computer and 360.
1194784	1223082	and when we got it I realized the control sucks like really sucks for that game because the controller analog stick is no substitute for a trackball not at all and then I thought oh well it'll be okay because I have it on the computer and I can use the mouse and the mouse makes it because a mouse is basically an inverted trackball so it makes it's not a perfect substitute but it's probably the best one there is so I figured okay I'll play Crystal Castles with a mouse nope can't use the mouse
1225888	1238516	I remember I used to play that on the Apple II way back in the day, and a mouse worked okay then, but I guess if they don't support it at all, then it's awful.
1238536	1254766	I could have missed something, but what I did is I unplugged my 360 controller and it defaulted to keyboard controls, and I couldn't find an option in there to switch it to the mouse to control, which makes sense because you don't have a mouse on 360, and the game is kind of made for both, and it's very obvious, but it's just...
1255586	1271011	you know it's just these little things that are just killing game room for me like there's so much potential with game room and there's so much that I really want to like about game room but there's these glaring things that just irritate me like oh why didn't you find this sooner you dummy
1271531	1276558	You know, just in the servers and some of the things with that.
1277119	1277479	Let's see.
1277559	1278300	Look at our chat room.
1278340	1282526	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Brad says, Sucks does not even begin to describe it.
1282646	1284368	Our buddy from PodCulture, Brad there.
1286531	1286791	All right.
1286891	1287112	Anyhow.
1289232	1312744	chat.orange.com if you want to join us so yeah a little bit of game room and just some random other games too on the arcade you know like playing Street Fighter and Puzzle Fighter and Mega Man 9 and just random stuff all throughout the week and WoW lots of WoW I rolled a Death Knight my Death Knight's already level just about level 61 PvP is super fun with a Death Knight I just want to say it's a lot of fun
1315096	1319118	All right, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, of which I don't have an awful lot.
1319678	1323841	Just, you know, join our Facebook, if you haven't already, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1324141	1327323	You can also follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
1327763	1331145	And definitely try to join us for a live show sometime, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock.
1331686	1333487	It's a much different experience when you listen live.
1333647	1339010	6 o'clock Pacific, of course, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at allgames.com.
1339050	1340251	That's really all I have for housekeeping.
1340271	1343073	We don't have any shows off that I'm aware of coming up or anything else.
1343673	1346775	So, we're just going to keep right on trucking with some gaming news.
1347776	1349497	Quite a bit of gaming news coming out of Konami.
1349517	1353180	They had their Gamers Night this week, right?
1353420	1353640	Really?
1353680	1354260	I didn't know.
1354621	1355541	We didn't get invited.
1355801	1357402	Well, you know, but it's in LA now.
1357442	1358683	I wouldn't have been able to go anyway if we did.
1358703	1359063	Oh, that's true.
1359083	1359484	That's right.
1360144	1361665	I always forget that they're not in San Francisco.
1361705	1362686	Yeah, they're not in the Bay anymore.
1362706	1364427	So, I wouldn't have been able to go anyway.
1364947	1365328	I don't know.
1365648	1369751	It's kind of one of those things where, especially if they're, you know, one thing we don't have news on is DDR.
1369811	1372412	And, you know, I realize that's kind of how we started.
1373673	1378438	I guess, I don't know if I should say this, but I don't know if I really should say this on air.
1378458	1381080	There's a very good chance we're going to have an interview with them at E3 this year.
1381581	1382181	Very good chance.
1383022	1384083	I'm trying to pull some strings.
1384463	1386645	So it's going to be a fun E3.
1387967	1388267	All right.
1388827	1389528	You're going to E3?
1389748	1389908	Yep.
1390529	1390729	Cool.
1390949	1391410	Good times.
1392321	1393141	All right, anyhow, sorry.
1393261	1397462	You want to tell us some news from... I thought you... Well, you can't go.
1397562	1399723	Now, I wondered why you were so like, nope, can't go.
1400183	1402043	Nope, there's no way I'm going to E3 this year.
1402063	1403944	And I was like, well, you're not even going to ask?
1403984	1404324	What the hell?
1404364	1407564	And now that we know that the wife is pregnant, now that makes sense.
1408545	1410185	Because isn't that right around the due date, too?
1410505	1411565	No, August.
1411765	1413146	Oh, no, okay.
1413886	1416186	Well, you said a long time ago, Jamie, you couldn't go.
1416506	1417486	You said school or something.
1418387	1419087	I'm trying to graduate.
1419467	1419607	Yeah.
1420928	1422733	So, I'll go.
1423355	1427246	I suppose if no one else wants to go, I'll go to E3 and do whatever...
1429113	1429694	Alright, anyhow.
1430274	1430714	Konami!
1431055	1431315	News!
1431395	1432476	Oh, I forgot to ask you.
1432576	1432756	What?
1432796	1434277	Because you went to PAX East.
1434317	1436259	Did they have any of the PlayStation Move stuff there?
1437340	1437920	Would you play?
1438061	1440222	No, there was no Move at PAX East.
1440282	1441543	Well, you'll have to listen to last week's show.
1441584	1441964	No, I'm kidding.
1442444	1444186	I don't want to listen to last week's show.
1444346	1445987	Yeah, it was pretty bad.
1446027	1447348	This week's isn't turning out much better.
1448689	1449450	APB was there.
1449550	1451132	I think that's the one you would have liked the most.
1451412	1453333	Yeah, they had a playable ABP.
1453373	1453994	I definitely thought of you.
1454334	1455635	I do have video I shot.
1455655	1457137	I can show you at some point.
1457877	1458037	Awesome.
1458077	1461338	That was the one that... Well, actually, you would have really enjoyed the line.
1461378	1462839	The Crackdown 2 was out on the floor.
1462939	1463199	Yep.
1463839	1468941	And I don't know what else you really liked, but it just seemed there was a lot of Loki games there.
1469181	1472662	Yeah, I wanted to check out Crackdown 2, but I'll wait for that.
1472722	1476523	I'm actually going back to Crackdown 1 to try to finish that.
1477043	1480284	I mean, I finished it, but I had to find, like, 10 orbs that I'm missing.
1482125	1485326	And just... I'm trying to go back to some of the older stuff, but really...
1487408	1488409	Cracked Into is going to be awesome.
1488609	1490550	I'm so sad that they pushed it to July.
1491110	1492091	It's supposed to be coming out in May.
1492851	1493151	All right.
1493351	1493652	Oh, well.
1494232	1495993	Hey, we had Konami news at some point, right?
1496093	1496313	Yes.
1496373	1496653	All right.
1496813	1498054	So let's talk about Konami.
1498614	1507279	Konami is taking a page out of Capcom's book, reissuing one of their games and kind of giving it the whole HD treatment.
1508059	1531450	Russian Attack 8 or Expatriate is a brand new Russian Attack game kind of looks very similar to Bionic Commando Rearmed and they're doing the whole 2.5D kind of update to it and it will be available on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and of course the game looks pretty cool except honestly I don't
1531510	1535933	I don't believe I liked Russian Attack very much, maybe just because it was very difficult.
1535953	1538355	It can't be a souped-up version of the old arcade game.
1538375	1540197	The old arcade game was too straightforward.
1540237	1542258	Like, it was a very old-school 80s game.
1542278	1544540	Well, this is supposed to be pretty linear, too, I think.
1544580	1545060	Interesting.
1545380	1554427	Well, you know, the little video I saw, it's ironic that you compare it to Capcom and Bionic Commando, because that's the first thing I thought of, and the look of it... Just the color palette and stuff reminds me...
1556869	1557289	Shadow Complex
1571434	1574295	Bionic Commando Rearmed, I think really cashed in.
1574315	1577295	I don't know why we keep comparing it to this, but it's just what I think of when I see it.
1577315	1578136	Because they did it well.
1578156	1580536	They were the best example of doing this.
1580696	1583877	Yes, but Bionic Commando had a lot of nostalgia with it.
1584057	1589558	I think more people remember Bionic Commando than remember Russian Attack.
1590679	1592059	Quick poll of our chat room.
1592439	1595320	How many of you remember Russian Attack?
1595905	1601953	Like, not just, like, name triggers, oh yeah, I think that was a game somewhere, but like, actually, like, can think of in your mind how the game plays.
1602734	1606319	Like, just, you know, especially versus Bionic Commando.
1606359	1608262	Just a quick pull of chat.
1608502	1609644	Do you remember Russian Attack, Jamie?
1610649	1612010	I remember looking at it.
1612250	1614110	And she's got a freaking vault of games.
1614150	1615511	I don't think we have Russian Attack.
1615531	1617252	She has a freaking game that came with a dish.
1617452	1619573	I mean, that's... That's true.
1619633	1620693	I do have a game that came with a dish.
1620713	1622374	And she doesn't remember Russian Attack very well.
1622414	1623994	I mean, that ought to tell you something right there.
1624514	1628136	So... And Dan's not here for us to... No, Zappy, not Russian.
1628416	1630377	It's Rush in Attack.
1630437	1630837	Oh, yeah.
1630937	1631877	I do remember that.
1632017	1633418	Like Rush and Attack.
1633498	1636559	Yes, but with an N. No, wasn't there an arcade one?
1636979	1637199	Yes.
1637279	1638500	Yeah, we had it at my arcade.
1639378	1640539	Okay, oh well, there you go.
1641539	1645621	No, there was another game, though, that was, I was thinking, never mind.
1645641	1647222	Yeah, we had it in my arcade.
1647282	1648182	Zappy in our chat room.
1648262	1650163	Russian Attack would be like Karnov.
1650443	1651204	That's Russian Attack.
1651344	1656326	It had that kind of oblique, all bold logo to it as well.
1656546	1656746	Yeah.
1656947	1657667	Yeah, I remember it.
1659029	1662790	Let's see, TigerClaw says Rush and Attack was a game I fondly remember.
1662910	1666851	I remember going to a local grocery store and putting a ton of quarters trying to beat the game.
1666891	1669832	It was hard, but then when I had fun playing it on the NES.
1670972	1676114	Let's see, TigerClaw also jumps in that Rush and Attack on the NES had two-player co-op.
1676674	1676834	M.A.
1676854	1679855	Satsuma said, I remember playing an XBLA demo of Rush and Attack.
1679875	1680396	Does that count?
1680756	1682296	And yeah, that was one of those Konami games.
1683217	1686918	They dumped a bunch of them onto Xbox Live when the arcade was first out.
1686938	1687919	They were like a dime a dozen.
1687959	1689539	I mean, some of them were notable.
1689599	1691140	You know, Frogger, the old arcade game.
1692400	1694121	It was one of the first ones, so it was still pretty cool.
1694241	1695682	Gyruss, I really liked that one.
1695722	1696362	Time Pilot.
1696782	1698423	There was a lot of obscure scramble.
1699023	1700944	They need a 2.5D HD remake of Contra.
1705345	1708246	They had a Contronics, but it was just the arcade version.
1708266	1710827	Well, yeah, but they had a sequel they did for WiiWare.
1710847	1713288	I mean, port that over.
1714608	1719510	I'll tell you one title, Konami, that will not work with this HD remix thing, and I think you've already done it anyways.
1719870	1720290	Frogger.
1720530	1722251	Please, God, no more Frogger games.
1722571	1722791	Ever.
1723071	1724211	I'm pretty sure it's already been done.
1724751	1727592	There was a Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade.
1727872	1732094	But the funny thing about it, it's actually like the third or fourth Frogger 2 that's come out.
1732874	1736317	Because, like, back in the Commodore 64 days, there was Frogger 2 3-deep.
1736978	1738479	There was Frogger 2 on the PlayStation.
1738599	1741061	And then there was this Frogger Swampies thing.
1741281	1741601	I don't know.
1741641	1741922	Whatever.
1742942	1744243	Ooh, DarkTetsuya has a good point.
1744263	1746886	It used to be called Green Beret in Japan, if I recall correctly.
1746906	1747506	I think he's right.
1747766	1750388	I think that game was called something completely different overseas.
1750428	1751449	I think it was called Green Beret.
1751749	1752090	That's right.
1752430	1755653	I remember the game on Xbox Live, but, like, before that, not really.
1756053	1756353	You know?
1756974	1757854	So, again...
1759035	1764016	I just, you know, if the nostalgia is what they're trying to cash in on, I don't think there's a lot of nostalgia there.
1764436	1766877	So I sort of hope the game can stand on its own two feet.
1766937	1769277	I mean, the game can rise above the nostalgia.
1769318	1773999	If it's a great game, it won't matter that it ties into this obscure-ass 80s game nobody remembers, right?
1774539	1774939	Exactly.
1775199	1780300	So we'll see, I guess, when... I imagine there'll be more of this at E3.
1781220	1781560	Probably.
1781820	1785321	Robert M. says, Rush and Attack was on the Game Boy Advance compilation, wasn't it?
1785861	1787002	I am, like, 95% positive yes, it was.
1788563	1792778	It was on that Game Boy Advance compilation that had all the old school Konami games from the 80s.
1794918	1795878	I don't know if they called it that.
1795898	1796879	It might have been on its other name.
1796919	1797239	I don't know.
1797819	1800821	Anyhow, lots of games were announced at the Konami event.
1800921	1802742	One of them is Saw II.
1802862	1803202	That's right.
1803282	1806923	Saw II is going to be coming out.
1807464	1809224	It's being developed by Zombie Studios.
1809284	1810405	They did the first game as well.
1810765	1818168	It's coming out for Halloween, just in time for the movie, because I think they have said that they will keep making those damn movies until they stop making money.
1818228	1820389	Considering those movies cost less than $10 million to make...
1821670	1823612	You're going to have a lot of Saw movies, guys.
1823672	1824232	Unfortunately.
1825193	1831418	I've got to admit, though, I'm kind of surprised that a Saw sequel is happening because I didn't think the first game did very well.
1831438	1831819	I could be wrong.
1831839	1833580	It didn't do that well, I don't think.
1836743	1838725	Honestly, having seen all the Saw movies...
1841378	1844639	It's so... The last one was alright, actually.
1844819	1845539	I kind of liked it.
1846639	1850580	But it's getting to the point like, okay... The game or the movie?
1850880	1851440	The movie.
1852340	1854800	But the games have nothing to do with the movies, right?
1854820	1856261	They don't follow the plots of the movies.
1856301	1857541	They try to do their own thing, right?
1858401	1858741	Sort of.
1859161	1866302	But I'm just saying, going the way of the movie, they basically killed off Jigsaw in the second movie.
1867122	1867663	Third movie.
1869203	1869983	Maybe the second movie.
1870123	1872509	I can't remember which one they... I think it was the second one.
1873031	1876499	Anyway, so it kind of makes it difficult to...
1879508	1883490	Keep having this guy do it because now you have someone else taking over for him.
1883710	1887913	It's just getting ridiculous now.
1888393	1888913	You know what?
1889313	1901620	According to VGCharts.com, again, take this with a grain of salt because I don't know how accurate these numbers are, but according to VGCharts.com, Saw pushed $0.21 million on the Xbox 360.
1901660	1901860	That's $200,000.
1902721	1906843	And then $0.23 million on PlayStation 3, so it's actually still better on PlayStation 3.
1907883	1924311	and so that would be a combined like half million so that's not bad but they only sold that I think right at launch I don't think that they really it it was a title that kind of did made its money the first two months and then just nothing
1924711	1932874	And I should say that is worldwide because actually the game did much better overseas than it did in the Americas, which is kind of interesting.
1934234	1936455	Oh, and that explains why the PS3 sold more.
1936515	1938896	Actually, the Xbox 360 sold more in America.
1938936	1941797	It sold about $120,000 in America and only $100,000 on PS3.
1941837	1942437	Don't get me wrong.
1942497	1943577	It was an alright game.
1943937	1945858	Again, take those sales figures with a grain of salt.
1946538	1948280	Yeah, and I think the game was alright.
1948340	1950341	It's just it was kind of repetitive, I guess.
1950801	1955845	And, you know, the new game, though, apparently is going to have some better puzzles in it.
1955885	1963351	They were talking about one that was being shown off as a demo, and apparently no one figured it out unless they were told how to do it.
1963831	1967274	So, I don't know if that's good or not, but it's interesting.
1968194	1974660	They're saying, of course, more yucky, gross death machines, which is the whole thing that kind of turns me off of the Saw series.
1975041	1976222	And I will admit, it's weird.
1976382	1984329	I have no problem with Konami's other franchise, Silent Hill, but I have no problem with the gore in that game.
1984409	1985711	But Saw bugs me.
1986031	1986712	I can't explain it.
1987072	1991036	And maybe it's because Saw is a bit too real, whereas Silent Hill...
1992852	1993993	Obviously, Pyramid Head's not real.
1994153	1994914	It's supernatural.
1995575	1998577	Yeah, it's a little more supernatural and I can't explain what the difference is.
1999017	2001179	Saw just... I don't know.
2001679	2003041	And I've talked about this on the show before.
2003101	2006864	It's just torture porn to me and it doesn't excite me.
2007864	2009806	I get that there's people into it, but I'm just not one of them.
2011212	2011952	DarkSakura
2038826	2039086	What?
2039186	2040927	You have some more news for us out of Konami?
2041247	2041948	Yes, I do.
2042608	2045290	But I'm still kind of about it.
2046250	2052533	Yeah, there is another Silent Hill game in the works for PS3 and Xbox 360.
2055355	2058357	But they didn't really give out any other information about that.
2059057	2060518	Just said that it's another one.
2061999	2063139	I'm surprised by this news.
2063439	2068142	I assume that Silent Hill was done because I assume that Homecoming did not perform well enough.
2068487	2075369	It didn't, but I mean, Shattered Memories did okay, but I actually returned my copy.
2077110	2082792	Wasn't the rumor that what they were showing, like a Shattered Memories type of game, not necessarily like Homecoming?
2083132	2084212	I thought I heard something.
2084272	2087213	The rumor is it's supposed to be like a sequel to Shattered Memories.
2087233	2089013	Like what Shattered Memories was to Silent Hill 1?
2089854	2091354	This is supposed to be to Silent Hill 2 or something?
2091394	2092615	I don't want that.
2092975	2093975	I don't want to play that.
2094035	2096896	I didn't really enjoy that much of Shattered Memories.
2098317	2098799	Weird.
2098919	2103210	I just, like, old, plain old good Silent Hill.
2103391	2104815	Last decent one was four.
2104835	2106720	And that's it.
2107208	2110650	Silent Hill Shattered Memories on the Wii, 0.18 million.
2111190	2114752	So that's less than, and again, these numbers are coming from VGCharts.com.
2115773	2117974	That's much less than what Saw moved.
2118034	2118795	How did Homecoming do?
2118815	2123417	The problem is, though... Homecoming moved 0.36 million.
2123457	2126119	That's on the 360, and how much on PS3?
2126139	2126119	0.23.
2126199	2126939	So it did better than Saw.
2129941	2142332	and that's the problem though with Shattered Memories though it being the mature Wii game that system whatever the reason you can put out really awesome mature games on it but no one's buying them
2143342	2152987	Well, the other thing that strikes me odd about the fact that they're continuing the Silent Hill franchise, I mean, even if the Silent Hill Wii game was critically well received, is the departure of Akira Yamaoka.
2153107	2159991	Because, like, to me, he was such a key component of that franchise, like, I really don't see how they can continue it without him.
2160391	2168595	I mean, if it's true that they're just, you know, redoing the second game, I suppose I can see that, because, I mean, how much did he really contribute to Shattered Memories?
2168655	2169276	I don't think he...
2170356	2171517	Did a lot for that game.
2171557	2172558	I mean, I don't know.
2172578	2174319	Did he even do the soundtrack?
2174779	2177481	Yeah, he I think worked on the soundtrack for that.
2177501	2185086	I think they finally learned that they really can't do anything else with the series.
2185126	2189248	They don't have the right kind of, I think, thought process to take it where it needs to go.
2190709	2191430	That's just my thought.
2191770	2195654	Interesting comment from the chat room, because this could spar another discussion here.
2195674	2205664	SSJ100, Matt, in our chat room, chat.orange.radio.com says, I remember the great horror movies of the 80s when it was about the scare, no matter how cheesy the effects were, whereas now it's shot gore.
2206464	2210889	He goes on to say, the thing, 80s version, is better than any Saw or Hostel movie.
2211689	2215833	And then somebody brought up, DJ Dark Knight says, Nightmare on Elm Street, nothing more, and Friday the 13th.
2216734	2221098	And it's interesting because they've remade a lot of those great 80s horror movies.
2221158	2223421	I mean, Nightmare on Elm Street's coming out in a couple weeks, right?
2224402	2227585	And it seems odd to me that those are not turning into games.
2228225	2236293	I mean, sure there was a Friday the 13th game years and years ago on the NES, which, by the way, I enjoyed way more than most people did, just on a tangent.
2236393	2236753	I actually...
2237834	2240015	I hate to say it because I know I'm going to get made fun of, but I don't care.
2240135	2242456	I actually enjoyed the Friday the 13th game when I was younger.
2242796	2244556	It made sense to me and I had a lot of fun playing it.
2244576	2245397	It was hard as hell.
2245737	2247417	I never beat it, but I thought it was a cool game.
2248098	2252179	I like the angry video game nerd, his review of it.
2252239	2252779	It was funny.
2254080	2257421	And there was a Nightmare on Elm Street game too, if I remember right.
2257441	2258101	Which was crap.
2258401	2266284	It was crap, but if my memory is right, it was one of the very few Nintendo games that used that four player expansion they had.
2266744	2269625	Remember how they had the four player thing on the NES?
2269705	2274666	I know that you could change your main character and that it was still really lame.
2275827	2277627	Every character sucked, pretty much.
2278427	2286990	Well, with the Saw and the horror franchises, doesn't it seem odd to anyone that there is not a video game coming out for Nightmare on Elm Street?
2287490	2289731	Or even that there wasn't one for Friday the 13th?
2289831	2294792	There hasn't been one for Halloween or any of the horror movies they've made in quite some time.
2295715	2296636	No, I'm not surprised.
2296917	2297317	Why is that?
2297557	2308110	Because first you have to pay the licenses for that, and they have an idea of how well these games perform.
2308639	2332678	and something like that it'd be kind of hard to expand on the storyline and stuff like for example Nightmare on Elm Street well what the hell would the game be about I mean you're basically going after Freddy I guess or you know trying to escape him but it's just hard to expand on the how you know whether enemies and stuff are you gonna have in it it just doesn't translate well into a game
2334125	2337609	It's strange, though, because so many movies that come out these days get games with it.
2337629	2338850	Like, you know, Avatar had a game.
2338910	2340211	Alice in Wonderland had a game.
2340271	2342173	Avatar learned itself very well to a game.
2342254	2343675	Yeah, that's easy, though, to do.
2344336	2348761	There's plenty of characters in that that you can build a game off of.
2349321	2350903	And same with Alice in Wonderland.
2350923	2354066	So there's plenty of creatures and enemies and stuff you can create for the game.
2354987	2375669	I read a very interesting article this last week that said that it was on Yahoo and the little teaser was this could have been a video game and this movie franchise is losing tons of potential dollars because there is no video game and you click on it to find out what franchise they're talking about any guess?
2376509	2377670	Twilight, because I read this.
2377770	2378231	Oh, did you?
2378411	2379492	Yes, Twilight series.
2379552	2382815	What's funny is they forgot there is a game based on Twilight.
2382895	2383695	Well, it's the scenic game.
2383715	2384296	That doesn't count.
2384316	2388799	That's still a game, and it's based on Twilight, so they're stupid because they didn't do the research.
2389020	2390461	I don't count that.
2390781	2392202	I blame, no.
2392663	2396366	Look, I don't want to see it either, but they make a point.
2397086	2399648	It's strange that there is no Twilight video game.
2399668	2401329	Look, and again, I don't want to see it either.
2401810	2403010	It doesn't make a good game.
2403050	2403671	That's why.
2404391	2408134	But if they make a game for Alice in Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory... But there's more characters.
2408214	2411757	Okay, she's not like... Push A to Sparkle!
2412457	2412957	Exactly.
2413078	2419062	It's not like she's running around slaying vampires or slaying werewolves or whatever.
2419562	2424766	She's just some whiny emo chick, and you can't make a game based on that.
2424826	2426347	Push B to Lock the Door and Cry.
2426627	2429351	I mean, seriously, you can't.
2429511	2431494	You can't really do that.
2431974	2433957	There's no enemies for the fight.
2433997	2434678	She doesn't do that.
2434698	2435499	It doesn't translate well.
2435519	2439184	It would be like the equivalent of making a game based off of...
2442199	2450144	Anything like, you know, like the money pit or, you know, just... I'm getting yelled at by chatters because they're saying, Ranma's saying, no Twilight game for PS3 360.
2450765	2451545	That's a smart move.
2451605	2453166	TigerClaw says, don't give them any ideas.
2453206	2454347	Do you really want a Twilight MMO?
2454407	2457049	Again, I have zero interest in the game.
2457629	2459991	But the capitalist money-making...
2460891	2471194	America, fuck yeah, side of me that's all about making money does say, you know, a Twilight game on the Wii that's not seen, I'm talking about an actual Twilight game, is a lost opportunity.
2471254	2471834	It really is.
2472094	2476075	I have zero fucking interest in it, but I know there's a lot of girls that would play it.
2476135	2477195	Here's how you do it, okay?
2477335	2487018	And this is how you can translate most of those games that don't necessarily, or most of those movies that don't necessarily work as games into games and have them still be alright.
2488118	2490820	You do them the way they did Heavy Rain.
2491601	2501909	That's the only way you can do it, is that you have some sort of context-based game that has a narrative that looks just like the movie.
2502109	2509154	That's really the only way you can do it, because as far as being an action game or anything like that, you can't do that with these games.
2509314	2510275	It makes no sense.
2511356	2515179	Frisbee in our chatroom says, Hey, I'd like a Twilight game if you got to play as Blade.
2518840	2524063	They really could do a dating sim.
2524803	2528985	And that would sell amongst the... God, that just makes me feel dirty.
2529005	2530466	What was that shirt I saw at Hot Topic?
2530586	2532226	And then Buffy staked Edward the end.
2532947	2533787	That's great.
2534628	2535548	I would wear that shirt.
2538325	2539146	It was pretty awesome.
2539286	2540186	I knew you would wear that shirt.
2540286	2540906	Okay, sorry.
2541046	2542207	I would rock that with pride.
2542347	2547429	Look, I want to put out a formal apology to our listeners and everybody for bringing up Twilight on Orange Lawn Radio.
2547449	2549310	It was inappropriate of me, and I apologize.
2549890	2551971	So, please, let's move on with a different video game.
2553251	2554152	It'll never happen again.
2556813	2559254	I think that I'm having an allergic reaction to that, Rob.
2559514	2560535	No, you're just sparkling.
2561455	2561555	Ah!
2565852	2566612	Loki, help.
2566692	2567292	Loki, help.
2588403	2600782	and nobody told Xbox Live because apparently on the Xbox Live Marketplace there is a wonderful banner announcing the Gears of War 3 game which will be coming April 2011.
2604008	2605429	That's a year off.
2606449	2607430	Yeah.
2608270	2612532	I just want to point out, I speculated earlier this year that Gears of War 3 would be an E3 announcement.
2612592	2616154	Okay, so maybe I screwed that up, but that it was going to support Project Natal.
2616174	2618395	Does that seem to be the case?
2618775	2619195	Doesn't say.
2620436	2629060	Don't know, but there's been some sort of rumors saying that it will feature, I guess, underwater combat this time and mech suits.
2630942	2633705	I mean, not that I think it needs to support Natal.
2633725	2639332	It was just kind of my gut feeling was they've been really, really quiet about such a big franchise for them.
2639752	2644378	And so I kind of thought that it was going to be like, oh, Gears of War 383 and it's Natal.
2644438	2647521	That's why we've kept it so under the wraps.
2647802	2648462	Well, it still is.
2648623	2649724	So I guess, you know...
2650985	2655027	We'll hear more about it, maybe if you want to watch Jimmy Fallon on Monday, I guess.
2655307	2657929	Or just wait for the YouTube to hit 15 minutes later.
2658029	2658489	Yeah.
2658809	2663792	Because, you know, I'd rather not subject myself to an hour of that.
2663852	2665213	I'd just watch the highlights.
2665733	2668434	Actually, I have to admit, I'm not huge on Gears of War either.
2668454	2669515	I'm just not good at it.
2670175	2674139	Gears of War, A, I suck at first-person shooters to begin with.
2674259	2680844	B, the thing about Gears of War is it's very about cover and stealth and being able to move around and be very tactical.
2681265	2691454	Whereas if I'm going to play an FPS, I've got to play something like Quake 3, which is just kamikaze, run out there, shoot everybody with rocket launchers, kill, kill, die, die type of stuff.
2691514	2694957	I'm not good at Gears of War because I can't cover.
2695057	2697619	I just run out and shoot everything and I always die.
2700726	2707290	And stuff like that is why Gears of War makes a better game franchise than Twilight.
2707830	2709651	Because there's no rocket launchers.
2709791	2714234	I mean, there's people dying, but they just whine about it.
2716155	2719157	SSJ100 Matt says, don't support NBC, go Team Coco.
2719877	2723720	So it's saying that you shouldn't watch the show anyway.
2723740	2728683	You should just wait for whatever will show up on Xbox Live inevitably anyway.
2729664	2732386	In support of Coco, who I'm seeing live next week.
2732886	2733666	Very excited.
2734987	2735468	Very excited.
2735488	2736968	Well, yay for you, Rob.
2737529	2739050	That's right, I should buy tickets for that.
2740030	2741231	I think they're all sold out everywhere.
2741251	2742252	Well, I meant for Sacramento.
2743553	2744374	I don't know.
2765436	2766017	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2795235	2801980	Not cool because A, you don't know what caused the error, which is going to be bad for EA and Mythic.
2802480	2807443	They're trying to refund the fees within 24 to 36 hours, but here's the problem.
2807864	2815029	People are going to start bouncing checks, they're going to overdraft, and they're going to threaten EA with this.
2815469	2819151	EA is going to have to pay for all these overdraft fees that they cause.
2819351	2819912	Without a doubt.
2820452	2822413	And so that's just not pretty for them.
2822453	2823154	That sets them back.
2823194	2824195	That's a big boo-boo.
2825335	2829038	But that's the one reason to be careful with these automatic withdrawals.
2829118	2832901	But it stinks because so many games kind of require them in this day and age.
2833582	2839827	But it makes you think about maybe using those prepaid cards instead because you don't want something like this happening to you, I'm sure.
2841493	2863825	I mean I don't think anybody did this intentionally or purposely I mean surely it was an error it's just a really crappy error that is just really no one wins in this scenario no one wins no and it's not like Warhammer Online was a game that was it kind of didn't need something like this on its reputation right now it's it's very unfortunate um
2865442	2867343	Can you imagine if something like that happened with WoW?
2867683	2868284	Oh my gosh.
2868964	2869384	Oh my gosh.
2869444	2874547	Banks would go under from all the people that would complain and rise up.
2875128	2875688	My gosh.
2876889	2882672	I don't think it affected everyone that played, but I think just those that probably had their statements renewed on a certain day, but still.
2882912	2883212	Stinks.
2884053	2884613	Too bad for them.
2886874	2887254	Let's see.
2888035	2891136	Ranma in our chat says, That happened to me with a hotel for Anime Boston.
2891176	2892817	Took them two weeks to refund my money.
2894937	2897018	So irritating that companies can do that.
2897078	2897678	But you know what?
2897758	2905982	If it results in overdraft fees and it's this company's fault, you should take them to task for it.
2906022	2906762	They'll refund the money.
2906802	2907302	They have to.
2908643	2908863	All right.
2908903	2909143	Anyhow.
2909798	2910778	That's messed up.
2911078	2911319	I know.
2912339	2915440	I looked at that and I was just like, yet another reason to hate Warhammer!
2916700	2917201	You know what, though?
2917221	2918361	That could have happened at any game, though.
2919421	2926024	I would bet money that EA Mythic contracts another company to handle all this and that company botched up.
2926704	2926984	Doctor Who
2948996	2949556	on PC.
2949996	2951157	We get a Doctor Who game.
2952097	2952317	Who?
2953818	2954178	Doctor.
2954698	2954858	Who?
2955359	2955679	Doctor.
2955919	2956099	Who?
2956719	2959160	Do not make me go hunt down my sonic screwdriver, please.
2960461	2960801	Anyway.
2962757	2982890	Starting on June 2010, there are going to be four interactive episodes that are going to be free on the BBC Doctor Who website with the current cast and the new producer, writer, guy, and a lot of...
2985023	2991766	Just story elements, I guess, going on with what's currently, I guess, going to happen in this season, and it's being developed by Sumo Digital.
2995228	3007434	It actually was said by the head of drama for BBC Wales, the executive producer for Doctor Who, that there aren't going to be 13 episodes, there will be 17, four of which are interactive.
3008275	3008395	So...
3008755	3010156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3031503	3032965	But that doesn't mean they won't do games.
3033526	3034126	Yes, it does.
3035027	3035208	What?
3035508	3036089	They ended it.
3036129	3037210	They completely ended it.
3037270	3041655	But can't they go back and do games from, you know, the canon earlier in the show or something?
3041675	3042916	I seriously doubt that's going to happen.
3042936	3045800	They do that all the time with franchises that are over.
3045860	3048102	They reinvigorate it for a game.
3048563	3049164	Well, okay.
3049304	3049845	I'll give you that.
3050425	3052307	Where's my northern exposure?
3053008	3053489	Shut up.
3054029	3062199	Wasn't there talk, actually, I'll say this not to deviate to sci-fi nerddom for a minute here, but wasn't there a talk that Fox wanted to do an American version of Torchwood?
3062980	3063621	Dear God, no.
3063941	3064442	I hope not.
3065015	3068537	and something about the guy, why can't I remember his name?
3068877	3070218	The guy that plays Captain Jack.
3071218	3073979	They actually were thinking of having him do it.
3074079	3074620	Johnny Depp?
3075020	3075440	No.
3076381	3077381	Not that Captain Jack.
3077641	3078141	The other one.
3079102	3080042	Why can't I remember his name?
3080082	3080563	Oh my God.
3081863	3082404	John Barrowman.
3082484	3082844	Thank you.
3083104	3083524	Barrowman.
3083704	3088967	The guy that played Captain Jack and sang all those songs and dressed up like a captain with hoochies hanging off of him?
3089507	3090367	That Captain Jack?
3091068	3091188	No.
3091368	3091568	No.
3091748	3092528	Not that Captain Jack.
3092729	3093329	John Barrowman.
3093349	3093389	Oh.
3096054	3097955	Captain Jack is such a common name.
3119986	3143916	Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City making its way out onto the Playstation 3 as well as PC Blood Bowl finally coming out on PSP this week as well and there's going to be nothing else I guess that is one hell of a light week
3146053	3149035	Alright, let's go to... I need to say something real quick.
3149155	3149515	Okay.
3150135	3155078	Since I hate having to spell this shit out because apparently I do every time I state something that's my opinion.
3155498	3159580	When I say something is over, I'm typically meaning it's over for me.
3159860	3160401	I don't care.
3160721	3161161	It's gone.
3162062	3166944	So... Okay, well I took what you said to mean that the show is actually over.
3167124	3170386	So it's not over, it's just you've written it off because you don't like the direction it's going in.
3171607	3173368	They got rid of everybody.
3174494	3175956	Except for one person.
3176918	3178581	There's nothing more in that for me to watch.
3178901	3179201	Okay.
3179282	3181485	Well, as someone who doesn't watch the show, I had no idea.
3181605	3182206	So there you go.
3183208	3183528	All right.
3184410	3185411	Japanese release dates.
3185531	3188095	No More Heroes is coming out on the Xbox 360.
3188135	3188436	So that is...
3189978	3195364	and yeah, I'd heard about that that they were going to remake that for the 360 because, you know, mature games don't do very well on the Wii.
3195384	3196285	It's going to be awesome.
3196345	3205335	So there it is on its way on the 360 this week and there's lots of people like Loki who will probably use his new JTAG not creepy anonymously donated 360 to play.
3205455	3206176	It could be a bomb.
3206196	3207357	I haven't opened it up yet.
3207578	3207898	Loki.
3209079	3210741	I'm going to get that screen somewhere.
3211161	3211461	All right.
3211702	3215805	On the PlayStation 3, also gets a version of No More Heroes as well.
3215905	3217727	It's a pretty dry week otherwise.
3217867	3218828	I guess that's kind of the anchor.
3218848	3219208	And there you go.
3219228	3222832	You can import the PS3 version if you don't have a modded console.
3223292	3225294	That's true because PS3 is region free.
3225454	3227916	Of course, it's all going to be in Japanese, but who cares?
3228597	3229638	Might be able to get through it anyway.
3230118	3250791	Nintendo Wii, not a thing this week You gotta wait till the 22nd for really any new games PlayStation 2, Clover no Kune no Alice comes out As well as Saiko Shogi Gakuyashashi Special That's just a price reduction to about the equivalent of 20 bucks in Japan So look for that, that's a gambling game though I mean really, do you guys import gambling games?
3250811	3251272	I don't think you do
3252252	3253112	on the Nintendo DS.
3253292	3255293	Let's Science with Marie and Gully.
3256133	3258353	That's a big game coming out this week on the Nintendo DS.
3258373	3259434	I've never heard of this game.
3261374	3262094	Let's Science.
3262174	3262454	I don't know.
3262474	3263494	Is that like Science Mama?
3264235	3264615	I don't know.
3265295	3268135	I know it has little equations in it and all this other stuff.
3269716	3276077	That is not Cookie Mama.
3276097	3277717	I thought it was because I saw Mama in the title.
3278017	3279178	Otoko means boy.
3279578	3280278	Yeah, it's like a little...
3280558	3282019	PSP, Sokoku no Kusabi, Hiro no Kakara 3
3304495	3331446	I don't recognize it it looks like it's based on an anime because it has really pretty cutscene looking things in it a lot of talking and chatting in the game can't tell what that is though sorry I'm not up to speed on all of my Japanese what is this maybe this is it too there's a limited edition of it coming out as well let's try to see if that would tell me what it is nope oh well that's coming out on PSP and that's it for Japanese release dates
3333152	3336435	DarkSakura, how about the Old Kingdom?
3337416	3341640	Well, on the 15th, we have Final Fight Double Impact.
3342201	3346024	We have Sam & Max The Devil's Playground, Episode 1, The Penal Zone.
3347165	3356174	And on the 16th, we have Samurai Shodown Sen, Grand Theft Auto 4, Episodes from Liberty City, and Splinter Cell Conviction.
3358206	3362190	Just a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.
3362431	3364873	But first, a few more news stories for you guys.
3364933	3365173	Loki.
3365894	3366114	Yes.
3367196	3375625	Of course, with the new update 3.21 that removes Linux from the PlayStation 3, which is retarded.
3376666	3377707	I'll just tell you right now.
3378127	3378668	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3393541	3398842	Since Sony made a big to-do about trying to patch it up, I'm not updating my system until I see what happens.
3399223	3400263	Don't you kind of have to?
3400323	3409565	I mean, if you want to play anything online, because it does that whole thing where it says there is a system update available and if you want to connect to PlayStation Network for anything, you have to upgrade.
3410065	3410345	Have to.
3411326	3414586	I don't connect to PlayStation Network because I don't play anything on it.
3414606	3415447	Okay, well then you'll be fine.
3415467	3415967	I'm just saying.
3416627	3421168	I mean, even to have the online leaderboards or anything, you can't
3421808	3423750	Play those without updating.
3424070	3425331	Because my system wasn't updated.
3425351	3427612	I mean, I haven't really played anything on PlayStation 3 this week.
3427912	3434697	But I went into a game on there the other night to show... Actually, I was showing a friend our little cameo in the Namco Museum game.
3435077	3436978	But that game wants to connect for leaderboards.
3437098	3440120	And it was not working right because it needed me to update.
3440140	3442202	That's when you unhook it from the internet.
3443022	3444063	I'm just saying.
3444103	3445884	You're going to be very limited until you update.
3446625	3446985	I'm okay.
3447943	3462519	Anyways, so what's important about this is apparently the guy Geohot, who has done different hacks on the iPhone and whatnot, he's I guess one of the first guys that jailbroke some of those I guess, I don't know.
3462939	3477705	Anyways, so he is now, he put out a video that shows him with a modded 3.21 system with actually the option to install the other OS still.
3477805	3482787	So basically he patched out their patch and just added the update or something.
3482987	3484468	And he says it's very easy to do.
3485608	3490070	But he also says that he's not going to necessarily program anything so that people can, you know,
3491707	3495837	Build like, you know, ways to pirate stuff.
3495978	3499186	But right now it's just doing it for the other operating system.
3499226	3500008	But that makes me wonder.
3501414	3501974	How long?
3502215	3505077	Because it's just a matter of time.
3505097	3526131	And in fact, actually, his quote basically is basically saying that because of this, they've potentially turned 100,000 plus legit users into hackers because now they're going to try to find... They weren't caring before about trying to break it to add Linux to it, but now that they're removing it,
3527072	3529914	They're going to be more diligent in trying to hack the PS3.
3530514	3535598	Well, it also just seems like no surprise that this was cracked in minutes.
3536078	3537580	Is that all?
3537620	3546286	Essentially what Sony did is they just released something that didn't actually remove the feature but just removed the menu item or something.
3547387	3550349	It sounds like this hack was so easy that this guy did.
3550389	3552911	It almost sounds to me like Sony didn't really take it out.
3553271	3555253	They just took out your ability to access it.
3555693	3562775	The PS3 and the PSP, for example, their operating systems are very similar, especially the way their patch files and stuff come over.
3564035	3568596	If you're familiar with the PSP, you're probably going to have an easy way around the PlayStation 3.
3568836	3575438	It's just there are certain things that they haven't figured out yet, and apparently this guy's figured out ways around it.
3576378	3599510	Um, now another kind of story that ties in with this is apparently there was a guy, um, a European PS3 owner who, um, received, I guess, a credit for, um, you know, about 84 pounds, I guess, from Amazon because he filed a complaint with the retailer saying that the firmware update violated some sort of, uh, European law.
3600951	3605052	and basically saying that the console no longer performed as advertised.
3605352	3605772	And you know what?
3605932	3607713	And I do think that is something, though.
3607753	3612854	I mean, if you're putting on the box or you had on the box, now they have all these slim systems and stuff.
3613234	3616175	Before you go there, in the U.S., it's not on the box.
3616695	3622576	I can't speak for the U.K., but I only know this because last week on Bobby's show, because right before the call, he actually had the box and he said it's not on the box.
3624408	3626709	I don't know about the UK, but the US.
3649006	3657750	It's still, no matter how insignificant it is, it still sucks that they removed it because, I mean, this is something you may be paying for.
3657910	3669476	Granted, it's not a feature that I use, but that'd be the same thing if, like, oh, well, I don't really watch Blu-ray movies on my, you know, PS3, and then they send a patch over that, you know, now prevents me from watching Blu-ray movies.
3670276	3675719	Granted, say it wasn't a feature I was using, that's still, like, you're removing a feature off the console.
3678524	3679726	And yeah, people should be pissed.
3680106	3687915	Because, granted, they're doing this for security reasons, but what if they find a way around something else?
3688696	3690218	What other features are going to be removed?
3692791	3693211	I don't know.
3693992	3697014	It's just a case of a couple bad apples ruining the barrel, I think.
3697054	3707400	But I think it was a little silly for Sony to put that feature in in the first place if they're closing it up because of piracy.
3707500	3709841	Because didn't Linux kind of lend itself to piracy anyway?
3709861	3714644	And I'm not talking about PS3 necessarily, but everybody knew there was emulators out there for the NES and, you know...
3715031	3722775	But, see, now, though, with Linux installed on these systems, they can sell, you know, a ton of them to different, like, universities or whatever, using them as number crunchers.
3723255	3725877	It's an easy way to make up some console sales, you know?
3726057	3728218	Just, uh, hey, look, you can run Linux on it.
3728238	3730159	It's like a little portable supercomputer.
3730199	3733901	You know, they were even saying, oh, yeah, it's, you know, it's a computer system.
3733961	3735022	It's not a game system.
3735062	3736222	It's a computer system.
3737023	3741605	Um, you know, of course, the rumors were that they were doing that to evade taxes or whatever.
3742185	3742886	But, um...
3745188	3746606	Still though, now you're...
3748743	3749103	I don't know.
3750885	3760372	They can do whatever they want, I guess, because since the end user license agreement anyways just basically says you're leasing the console from them, so if they want to take features away, I guess they can.
3760752	3771360	But as a consumer, I will probably think twice when it comes to the next PlayStation system that they are advertising can do such and such things.
3771440	3775243	You'll probably think twice, hey, what are they going to remove later?
3775923	3777124	Because it doesn't go their way.
3779341	3781542	It is very interesting that they can just kind of do that.
3781862	3790424	And we all accept that because it's in the agreements that we hit A to get through real fast on the Xbox.
3792384	3793344	It just seems, I don't know.
3795765	3799966	And also, if you ever happen to click no, then you just don't get to use it, right?
3800006	3800166	Exactly.
3800186	3800466	Exactly.
3801629	3801970	I don't know.
3803911	3806734	It's just kind of sad there's nothing to protect me.
3807714	3810477	It would be different if it was just connecting to their online service.
3810557	3815261	And I understand, yes, they can prevent you from going to their online service for whatever reason.
3815301	3817302	If they want you to update and you don't want to, then fine.
3817343	3818804	You can't connect to their online service.
3819444	3825787	But, you know, offline games, if you pop in a game or whatever, it will just automatically patch your system up anyways.
3826207	3828668	You can't just say, no, I don't want to install this patch.
3829008	3830329	It's going to do it regardless.
3831029	3843895	And they do it, obviously, as a security feature so that, you know, you can't go and hack the PlayStation 3, but... Whatever, then maybe they should have figured out a way to be able to leave that operating system on there and not have it, you know...
3845413	3850459	Have access to whatever that's on the PlayStation 3 that you can apparently hack the system with.
3852481	3852801	All right.
3853102	3861671	Well, turning to something that is an old standby and reliable, and you know these are always coming and not going to get taken away from you, Pokemon.
3861831	3862292	That's right.
3862632	3865696	Taking a step over to the Nintendo systems, Pokemon.
3865956	3866416	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3886305	3908008	They are going to be coming out this fall in Japan for the Nintendo DS That is DS, not the 3DS So these are still games I mean, obviously the 3DS will play them As we know about the 3DS so far But these games are being developed for the DS More info is supposed to come in the next few weeks But the game is supposed to be out in fall And I imagine we'll see some of this at E3 as well The logo design is gorgeous
3908655	3912518	Even though the games probably won't come out in America for some time What is so gorgeous about the design for you?
3912538	3934475	I just like it, I just really like it It's popping, I have this thing for black and white And just with the red Pokeball in the background I think it's actually really eye-catching and really well done It's very interesting that they decided just to go with black and white Like, you know, just very plain colors, if you will None of this like ruby, sapphire, emerald, just black and white
3934915	3942428	Honestly, I think using black and white is I always thought of just using black and white as being more classy.
3943956	3945818	than going for the sparkly poo.
3945858	3947940	So a classier, more refined Pokemon?
3947960	3948621	I think so.
3948641	3957952	I think that it takes a lot more talent to... I mean, I prefer things being pretty clean in how they're done.
3959133	3960975	Honestly, I like the logo.
3961836	3965460	The fact that I could actually look at it and read it right away, I was kind of impressed with myself.
3966238	3969260	Actdeft in our chatroom says the third version is going to be gray.
3971381	3973002	Make it easy, huh?
3973062	3974123	Yep, so more Pokemon.
3974483	3979787	I'm just kind of surprised this information is coming out so soon after the release of the games we just had here.
3979927	3985350	But at the same time, we have to remember this news was tailored for Japan, not really for the U.S.
3985390	3987211	And those games have been out in Japan for some time.
3987251	3992875	It's kind of like the news about the 3DS came out, what, like the day that the DSi XL was released here?
3995726	4011012	interesting we can only learn from like you know another game company that has announced a revision to their system right as they're launching their system hmm that hasn't happened before has it oh wait no it has yeah
4012557	4016640	Bochiko on our chatroom says classy Pokemon, a squirrel in a top hat with a cane.
4017560	4018041	Possibly.
4018921	4020622	And Frisbee in chat says there's my problem.
4020682	4028187	I don't know if I should buy black or white or wait for gray since it's inevitable that there will be a third version as well.
4029468	4030008	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4057842	4068629	Every week here on the show we like to take a look at gaming's past and take a trip to the classic vault and look at the classic video game of the week where DarkSakura will pick one game from the archives and she says, you know what?
4069069	4078575	You ungrateful kids playing with your Pokemans all day and collecting your mudkips you should take some time out to pay tribute to those that paved the way for these games.
4078935	4079876	It's the classic game of the week.
4079916	4081517	DarkSakura, what did you pick for the kids tonight?
4082458	4084159	The game I have chosen is Summer Showdown 2.
4086627	4087467	Samurai Shodown 2
4116196	4122399	Um, it also has a bunch of Easter eggs in it, which I think is absolutely fun, and has the POW meter.
4122819	4123540	Ooh, POW.
4124640	4127301	Um, I actually own this game on Neo Geo.
4127542	4128222	I have the cartridge.
4129560	4137428	I will technically, I have the Japanese cartridge, but you know, you can actually switch your country of origin on it and it changes your blood to sweat and back and forth.
4138570	4140912	Like, this is from the Japanese version, clearly.
4141893	4143515	Because there's blood everywhere.
4143975	4145757	It's white sweat for the US one, so...
4146838	4149339	But this one had some of the best characters in it.
4150199	4155562	Actually, like, I have to say three of my favorite characters came about in this game.
4157122	4161744	Kiba-Gami Genjuro, who was Hau Maru's rival.
4162644	4165806	Cham-Cham, who replaced Tam-Tam, the little cat girl.
4166666	4167266	And she was fun.
4167286	4168607	She had, like, the giant boomerang.
4168767	4170728	And I don't know that she's been in anything else.
4170748	4171548	She was fantastic.
4173909	4174650	Nighthawk Saiger
4202489	4204150	I would say Japanese theater.
4204591	4208575	A Kuroko is like a stagehand.
4209235	4214661	The person who goes behind the scenes and wears all black so that you don't... He's supposed to be invisible.
4215161	4217824	He'll be like a prop or something or change scenery.
4218024	4221645	There's a really cool music video that uses all that.
4221865	4226047	It's a Scissor Sisters video and I can't remember what song it was, but they do that.
4226987	4228747	Except that he's not on a black screen.
4229328	4232229	He's just a dude in black hanging out by the scenery.
4232749	4234729	It's like what I would do in Rocky before.
4235610	4236650	I was the curtain.
4237990	4238251	Right.
4239691	4242692	Yeah, Rob used to climb up on me a couple of times.
4243550	4249312	Let's not give the listeners the wrong impression of our friendship.
4249832	4259734	There was also a female boss in the game named Rashojin Mizuki.
4261295	4262975	Yeah, Amakusa was not female.
4263135	4264756	Amakusa was just a really girly dude.
4265836	4272641	Um, you also, um, had, um, a blocking and a parry technique.
4273701	4285109	Um, basically, you would, you know, push against sword to sword, you'd lock, and then whoever came across it could get in a hit that was unlockable.
4286129	4288231	And, um, they actually borrowed that for Street Fighter 3.
4288511	4291553	Well, the kind of parry thing, the parry thing in Street Fighter 3 was different.
4291573	4291773	Yeah.
4292533	4299958	Um, you, um, there were cameos from other SNK characters and different stuff would happen.
4300679	4307263	My favorite Easter eggs, though, was like this weird little move that you could do with each of the characters that would make them chibi.
4307663	4310165	They'd just be little chibi cutesy versions.
4310265	4311626	They would just show up chibi.
4312908	4313529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4329726	4332769	Seriously, to me, it's one of my favorite games ever.
4333770	4334250	It's up there.
4334310	4335872	I'd put this up there in the top ten.
4335912	4337753	Probably one of my favorite fighting games ever.
4340436	4348523	As far as versions that came out, it only came out on Neo Geo for the longest time.
4350044	4354808	And then there was the Neo Geo CD version came out for Windows.
4355709	4356130	And then...
4358241	4359942	That version actually came out in the U.S.
4360543	4367988	There was a PlayStation version that came out in Sadamai Spirit's Kenkaku Shinan Pack, which was the first two, and it only came out in Japan.
4368548	4377274	And then the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, there was an Xbox Live Arcade and a PS2 Wii Anthology were announced.
4377374	4382397	So... It's...
4384703	4386405	This is seriously a fantastic game.
4387366	4389128	It's one of, like I said, one of my favorites.
4389889	4394695	And I think out of all of them, the only... Actually, no, I'd probably say that this one is my favorite.
4395356	4401663	The only reason that I would actually sometimes pick Summer Tread on 3 over 2 sometimes is just to play as Rimuru.
4402083	4404786	Because she had the ice... Rimuru?
4404826	4405207	Rimuru?
4409410	4410010	Bite Me Rob.
4410790	4412090	That's the name is Bite Me Rob.
4412730	4415151	And then I'll go grab my cartridge in a second, but that's it.
4416371	4420472	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Samurai Showdown 2.
4421512	4422213	Not 1, not 3, 2.
4423813	4427574	But you'll probably see 1 and 3 in future weeks when Jamie starts running out of games.
4427734	4428934	Because you've been doing this a while now.
4428994	4432095	Gosh, this is probably like the 100th game of the week, if not more.
4432115	4432315	Rob.
4432455	4432615	What?
4433015	4434496	You've seen The Vault.
4434656	4434936	I know.
4435296	4438097	I've got a couple thousand games in there.
4438357	4439457	I'm not going to run out.
4440298	4440658	Alright.
4442058	4442579	We'll see.
4442799	4445400	I'll be scraping the obscure if you really want to get to it.
4445420	4447500	What are you going to do when you run out of Sega?
4447520	4449561	I don't think I'm going to run out of Sega.
4451122	4451742	Alright, we'll see.
4452188	4455231	Alright, anyhow, for now though, we're going to take a quick break, but we'll come back.
4455251	4456792	There's still plenty more to talk about tonight.
4456832	4460415	You know, we haven't even touched the big iPhone news this week, and yes, it does affect gaming.
4460755	4462316	We're going to talk some Red Dead Redemption.
4462336	4464378	That's like hammer-rum-rum-rum-rum-rum-rum-rum.
4467833	4476062	And we're going to talk about some of the Microsoft changes to live that are going to be kind of interesting, especially for those of you that like to play games on the computer.
4476843	4479666	Talk about a lot of that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4479686	4480967	So stick around, folks.
4481067	4482249	We will be right back.
4485871	4489517	And for those of you guys listening live tonight on All Games Radio, we're going to take a quick music break.
4489938	4490619	Stay tuned with us.
4490659	4493223	Just a little bit of potpourri of music tonight to listen to.
4493243	4498693	We're going to be back in a few minutes while we just take a second to rest our voices and so forth with more of Horizons Radio.
4498773	4499314	We'll be right back.
4505996	4512381	Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, April the 11th of 2010.
4513682	4517004	We're joining you for our 362nd episode of the show.
4517044	4519246	We're into Part B right now, the second half of our show.
4519766	4522568	We have some rapid fire news coming up and of course Twitter topics.
4522688	4524129	Just got a few more minutes to get those in.
4524170	4525090	We already have quite a few though.
4525130	4528313	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to ask us something on Twitter.
4529313	4536820	And still some more news to get to in tonight's program Lots and lots of good stuff Loki, why don't you help kick it off with some rapid fire news
4537136	4544938	Yes, as it's been kind of a trend lately, there's been a lot of good games coming to the Xbox indie game service.
4545678	4551739	And actually, kind of not a stranger to doing some of these smaller indie games out there.
4551799	4555620	Gameloft, they have decided to put a game on there called Tank Battles.
4556040	4556900	Actually, it's pretty sweet.
4557420	4564302	Very kind of a high-quality tank battling game, almost like a souped-up combat, if you will.
4564722	4569464	How many of those games from the indie games have crossed over to regular Xbox Live?
4569484	4570124	Hasn't there been like one?
4570144	4570244	Yeah.
4593856	4599740	Uh... Weren't they saying some time ago that there were going to be more that would cross over to actual games, or am I just making stuff up?
4600580	4604863	They do, like, a contest, I want to say, each year, and there's some that come out of that.
4605363	4606424	Ooh, one a year!
4606804	4610086	Well, no, not... They do a contest once a year.
4610126	4612608	They don't necessarily port just one game from that.
4613428	4614749	Um... But...
4616149	4643400	I don't see a lot of them coming over the Xbox Live Arcade but I don't really think it needs to because especially when those ones that do win the contest they do get singled out on you can select I think contest winners or competition winners or whatever and you can actually see those and then also of course now with the new rating system and stuff it allows games that are actually pretty good to make it to the forefront so people can sort through all the hundreds of games that are on there so
4645401	4673009	um it's not horrible I don't know it's getting better that's for sure um lots more games are coming out on there um now one game that we of course are not going to probably see on indie games but perhaps an Xbox Live Arcade release or maybe something on the PlayStation Network who knows um Rocket Knight another game coming out um of course you may remember Rocket Knight I believe was an old Konami franchise and um
4673829	4674129	and DarkSakura.
4701636	4701916	I don't know.
4702957	4712944	But yeah, I don't know if the screen... It's kind of souped up looking, so obviously the screenshots probably don't bring back any memories of the original game, but it looks neat.
4713525	4713845	Alright.
4714225	4715146	So, that'll be coming out.
4715746	4718148	And then finally...
4719600	4724804	Another Xbox Live Arcade game, and also going to be coming on Steam as well.
4725424	4732430	Serious Sam HD, the second encounter, is of course getting its brand new HD remake, I guess.
4733350	4737033	And should be coming to Xbox Live soon.
4738594	4745399	They haven't really made an official date yet for Xbox Live Arcade, but the Steam version is supposed to be coming out around April 28th.
4746500	4752107	and, of course, the PC version on Steam will be available for $17.99.
4753488	4757993	And I guess that'll be, if you pre-order it, otherwise it's going to be $20.
4758674	4765882	No word on exactly what it's going to cost, of course, on Xbox Evercade, but probably somewhere around that, maybe $15.
4767484	4776170	By the way, Ranma in our chatroom is clarifying, just in case you didn't know, Rock Ignite Adventures was on the Sega Genesis, and the sequel Sparkster was on the Super Nintendo and Genesis.
4776410	4779412	So Sparkster was the original sequel.
4780152	4783534	Alright, I got some other rapid quick stories for you guys.
4783694	4785816	A couple items around Rock Band.
4786196	4793881	Of course, the weekly Rock Band releases, the songs that are coming out on Rock Band this week, either on the 13th or the 15th, depending on what system you're on.
4794902	4810854	The Used will be releasing the songs Blood on My Hands, Born to Quit, and The Taste of Ink and some individual tracks from Surge, Tonkin, Empty Walls, and Sky is Over as well as All Star by Smash Mouth if you haven't heard that song 500 times in 1999 you can hear it all over again
4814296	4814857	Green Day Green Day
4836296	4848061	The songs that will be in the game, I'm not going to name them all, but I will just say it almost looks like most of the Dookie album, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown, almost like all those albums seem to be there.
4848081	4851042	I mean, there are some tracks missing, but the big, big components of those albums.
4851762	4860206	Otherwise, from Warning, there's Minority and Warning, Nimrod has Hitch and a Ride, Good Riddance, Time of Your Life, you know, when you need that slow jam, that quintessential goodbye song.
4861027	4865892	Nice Guys Finish Last, and then Insomniac has Brain Stew, Jaded, and Geek Stink Breath.
4867133	4870736	Downloadable content includes 21 Guns and so forth.
4871577	4872378	A few songs there.
4873259	4879806	And then lastly for you guys, Squeenix has some Final Fantasy XIV updates this week, including some of the races and clan information.
4880926	4908600	basically your races can boil down into these different clans so you can play one of the not Galka but they're actually called Rogadins now you can actually be like a seawolf fisherman type of Galka I keep wanting to call them Galkas but I guess they're Rogadins now or you can be like a fire type Hellsguard clan so it's like all the races now have clans too so you have like a specialized sort of place that your race comes from well I'm glad they actually changed something other than the names
4908880	4915803	Well, here's the other big thing is that some more information came out that's out there on the internet and your characters have like first and last names now.
4916603	4922265	A lot of instances play into the game apparently where you get your own copy of the world.
4922306	4927688	Dude, the game is sounding more and more like Final Fantasy XI meets not Warcraft but Guild Wars.
4928228	4931949	Like I seriously think the game that they're making is like Final Fantasy XIV Guild Wars.
4931969	4933170	Okay, that sounds playable.
4933730	4959069	Just make it so I don't have to pay an online fee like Guild Wars and I'm there Sadly I don't think that part but there's screens from the alpha that are leaking out there now and you can see I'll have to show you the website here in Studio Loki and Jamie if you want to see it too but definitely look like your items are on like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 like you push the button to do the attack now like it's a little more wow-ish or Guild Wars was kind of the same way so very curious to see how this plays out
4959545	4965689	Well, as long as I can do it with a controller, because I kind of miss playing with a controller.
4965849	4973334	Well, if they're developing it for PS3, then I'm sure controller will be... I mean, but it'll be weird, because I don't know if you'll be able to put in just any old controller, or what you'll have to do.
4973374	4975375	Break out the old Gravis pad, do it the old school way.
4975874	4976435	It should be fine.
4977136	4977836	We'll see what happens.
4977936	4980860	More to come when the beta for that is released.
4980920	4984644	But meanwhile, we just have stuff leaking out from the alpha.
4984704	4991732	While Jamie does her quick stories here, I'll pull up that website that somebody texted me here in studio and show you guys the screenshots.
4992133	4994015	And I'll post it in chat if anyone actually cares.
4994758	5016372	Well, some kid who is on Facebook plays Farmville and used their parents' credit card to run up a 905-pound tab, basically about $1,300, $1,400 to pay for stuff.
5016712	5020515	I guess he took his mother's credit card and put it in.
5022537	5038000	and uh spent all that money so they're trying to figure something out on it I guess I just think I hate I hate Farmville anyway I think it's a waste of time I mean I know people like it they want to do it fine but if you got kids that play it watch out for your credit card
5038240	5038780	Thanks for watching!
5055589	5056330	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5072845	5073726	So is it Facetron?
5090319	5091620	that doesn't work so much.
5091680	5093822	Like, that's been kind of a pattern of South Park lately.
5093902	5097544	Like, the first 15 minutes are hilarious, and the second 15 minutes are not nearly as funny.
5097604	5100686	And that's kind of, sadly, the Tron part, not as funny as the rest of it.
5100746	5102288	But I thought it was awesome they referenced it.
5102368	5103108	I love Tron, though.
5103468	5103729	All right.
5105470	5109353	Namco Bandai is doing something really neat.
5109693	5114957	We're getting Splatterhouse on, I guess they're doing a...
5117290	5119372	They're doing a new game that got delayed and delayed.
5119793	5120734	Saying that?
5121194	5121495	Sorry.
5123417	5123677	Okay.
5126028	5134334	As I was trying to say, they're doing a new Splatterhouse and they're going to put the original trilogy on the disc.
5135355	5137937	I guess this is a little fun compilation to add on to that.
5140259	5148985	It will have the original arcade version of Splatterhouse, as in the uncensored one, and then Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3 that were the Genesis versions.
5150526	5152328	So, that'll be pretty fun.
5155951	5166461	I have it, but I haven't played it in so long that I'd have to break it out and see I don't recall it really being that censored
5170826	5186696	and then we have for Xbox Live in April Final Fight and Mega Man 10 download content basically it's Final Fight Double Impact and that's going to be on April 14th
5188437	5201364	and then there will be the mall half-priced on April 12th and then two add-ons for Mega Man 10 which is base and special stage one base also known as Forte
5202574	5203575	Final Fantasy Devil Impacts
5227194	5233801	There's no new game this week because they're too busy shutting down Xbox service on April 15th.
5234022	5234843	It's gone.
5234903	5235463	It's out there.
5235924	5237065	So get your taxes done.
5237886	5239508	And get your last Halo 2 game in.
5239708	5241871	Unless you're going to play on PC from here on out.
5241891	5244754	I hope we get a patch so we get our 100 plus friends now.
5245655	5252343	It's weird though because they already had the big patch for the USB support this past week, so I don't know if there's going to be another one.
5252984	5260412	I don't know if you heard, and I can't remember if we're talking about it, I don't think we are, but you heard that that uncrippled the hard drive set of consoles that got banned.
5261594	5261674	Oh?
5261694	5261774	Yeah.
5262065	5263366	Yes, that patch did.
5263846	5264266	Interesting.
5264426	5265947	Yeah, I think that is interesting.
5267447	5270709	Alright, I wanted to quickly answer some questions from chat.
5270749	5276131	Chat.orange.radio.com, Frisbee's asking in reference to the South Park episode, what did you think about the chat roulette part?
5276231	5277492	Oh, I forgot that they make chat roulette.
5277532	5279133	I didn't even realize that was a real site.
5279173	5280173	I actually had to check that.
5280193	5281754	I was like, holy crap, that's a real site.
5281834	5289317	The only way that I know that's a real site is that I've seen the YouTube of the guy that, well, I've seen a couple YouTubes.
5289377	5290578	The guy that does the piano
5291598	5292499	Penis, penis, penis, penis.
5317089	5324980	I thought it was funny, but it was kind of one of those things where the joke got old, and then they kept saying it over and over again for another three minutes, and I was like, okay, I'm over it.
5326022	5327703	Chat roulette, not a site.
5327764	5329145	I'm barely on AIM and Skype.
5329185	5330826	Why would I go on chat roulette and talk to strangers?
5330866	5332827	I can't even talk to my friends online.
5335029	5336270	I'm not going to go on chat roulette.
5338472	5339773	Let's get to some Twitter topics.
5339933	5341894	Every week we let you guys ask questions on Twitter.
5341974	5343696	It seems like every podcast does this now.
5344196	5345657	I've been listening to more podcasts lately.
5345737	5347358	Everybody has a damn Twitter segment now.
5348139	5349480	I'd like to think we were one of the first.
5350621	5351962	It's like we were one of the first Skype shows.
5354156	5354676	But whatever.
5355476	5363658	It's awesome because it's our listeners and they ask some crazy ass questions sometimes and share some stories with us that we might otherwise miss on the show.
5363678	5364739	That's the other very important thing.
5365239	5368360	Redertainment asks, games to play while drunk?
5369280	5369740	And go.
5371160	5372281	I'd play DDR drunk.
5373481	5375741	Rock band if Jamie's party yesterday was any indication.
5375761	5376602	I wasn't really drunk.
5379002	5379642	You weren't drunk.
5379662	5381423	Karaoke games would be kind of funny.
5382287	5382968	Thank you for watching!
5401005	5414522	That he's playing right now Robot Unicorn Attack, there you go Actdeft says Konami is distributing Latin American made game Lucha Libre AAA Heroes Del Ring in America Ironically, it's not coming out in Mexico
5419043	5419323	I don't know.
5419524	5420904	Maybe another developer is putting it out there.
5420944	5421284	I don't know.
5421324	5425465	But if you like your Mexican wrestling, which it is kind of a niche thing, but it's pretty cool.
5426085	5428406	Yeah, and it's actual stars of AAA wrestling.
5429146	5434307	El Elegido, Abismo Negro, Psycho Clown, Electroshock, like actual... And Charlie Manson.
5434327	5435648	There's a wrestler named Charlie Manson.
5436248	5436468	That's...
5437508	5439569	A little close to a certain serial killer.
5440749	5441229	So there you go.
5442230	5443110	I think that's on purpose.
5443190	5444550	You might remember Konami.
5444590	5446491	This isn't the first time they put out wrestling games.
5446591	5447971	Oh no, they had Rumble Roses.
5448751	5449812	Remember Rumble Roses?
5450532	5451632	Wasn't that like your favorite Xbox game?
5452072	5453353	I wanted to play that actually.
5453453	5455974	It's a game that Dan would never pick up, but I really wanted to play it.
5456034	5457614	You probably get it now for like $3.
5457874	5458354	I'm sure.
5459315	5462296	I think I saw Dead or Alive Volleyball or whatever for like $10 the other day.
5462316	5463476	Hey, that was fun.
5464758	5465858	There's a game to play when drunk.
5466579	5467179	We've got it.
5468059	5470020	And yes, I've watched Dan play it while I was drunk.
5470500	5472121	Portal Drunk, instant throw up.
5472781	5476943	SSJ100Matt on his Twitter account says, Not so much a story, but a question for Loki.
5477323	5478123	Are you paying attention, Loki?
5478203	5479044	I'm paying attention.
5479084	5480684	He's playing the unicorn farting game.
5480704	5482585	Well, he just crashed the unicorn, so here we go.
5483045	5487367	What's your opinion on the kid that was caught trying to steal the game Breach at PAX East?
5488214	5491056	Well, it was a good attempt, I guess, but he got caught.
5492377	5493638	Don't compliment him.
5494018	5495159	Nice try, kid.
5495279	5496820	He doesn't deserve a compliment.
5497300	5499662	It was a stupid asshole thing to do.
5499762	5501303	Yeah, well, his reasons were retarded.
5501323	5503024	It's like, I just wanted to play this with my friend.
5503865	5508208	Well, no, you wanted to brag that you had the game is what you wanted to do.
5509088	5514212	And unfortunately, you're stupid and you got caught, so now you're going to face fines and jail time and all that stuff.
5514272	5514492	Yeah.
5515232	5515973	Hope it was worth it.
5516093	5519014	I'm going to say he probably shouldn't have done it in the first place.
5519635	5521516	Just taking a lucky stab in the dark.
5522236	5523537	Well, he shouldn't have, but you know.
5523557	5526038	He wanted to make a name for himself.
5526058	5528059	It's kind of surprising that he had the balls to do it.
5528699	5530420	And then not show up to his court date.
5530440	5531061	That was pretty fun.
5532582	5533382	Hilarious.
5533682	5534983	He was too busy playing on Chat Roulette.
5535823	5537184	He was playing Modern Warfare 2.
5538045	5538525	Was he really?
5538685	5538805	Yeah.
5541334	5541775	Samurai Shodown 2
5560536	5561277	Samurai Shodown 2
5581090	5588092	Actdeft says DJ Hero's price is now down to $50 at Toys R Us and links us to a new story about the price reduction.
5588492	5591253	That didn't move as well as they thought it would.
5591553	5593734	Now would be a good time to pick that up for DJ Hero 2.
5593874	5594334	Just saying.
5594634	5597215	If you want to get the controller and have it for DJ Hero 2.
5597375	5604317	And they also have, if you really want to spend the money, they have these new bundles now that have two DJ Hero controllers with the game.
5605259	5606060	It's a good game.
5606120	5609362	It's a bummer they didn't support the download content better because they could have done better.
5610182	5611403	I'll pick up the sequel.
5611423	5612524	Don't get me wrong.
5612904	5613645	It's an awesome game.
5613685	5620710	It's just typical, I guess, of Activision and their support for the download content.
5621010	5626853	I mean, if you've seen what they do for the Guitar Hero series, it's not a big surprise that we only have, like, three pieces of download content.
5627433	5630214	DarkTetsuya says, I just realized we haven't heard from the ferret in a while.
5630234	5630974	Whatever happened to him?
5631355	5634976	Well, when we moved the show to Studio DarkSakura, the ferret didn't really come with us.
5635076	5638798	I found it while moving, so the ferret is at my place right now, but...
5639258	5640359	We'll see you next time.
5667523	5668844	Ferret was, oh god, my ears.
5669104	5669705	Ferret was better.
5670185	5670485	Alright.
5672046	5672847	Ferret or Dalek?
5672927	5673467	I say Ferret.
5674088	5678831	Anyhow, Ray Iannami says, or no, I'm sorry, I skipped one.
5678891	5681834	Spazinator also sent, usually I don't do two tweets, but I will allow it tonight.
5681874	5685396	Spazinator PSN says, Rob, you asked about a month ago if I seen the tester.
5685476	5686157	Finally seen it.
5686217	5687258	I have similar thoughts on it.
5687578	5688699	You know, I stopped watching it.
5689339	5694924	I heard it ended finally and I'm pretty sure Season 1 ended Oh god, are they doing another one?
5695145	5703953	Yeah, wow Well, anyhow, I'm pretty sure the person I thought was going to win won You know, I would go on season 2 of The Tester Why not?
5704613	5715423	I mean, they probably tape it over a weekend and you get $5,000 for winning I mean, I probably wouldn't keep the job but I'd like to have the $5,000 I'd quit it I'd be a fame whore, why not?
5717349	5718990	Now that you've won the tester, what do you think?
5719711	5719991	Go Xbox.
5720151	5720471	I don't know.
5720491	5720831	I quit.
5721312	5721552	All right.
5723293	5724174	Might be fun for the experience.
5724194	5724554	This game sucks.
5724594	5726275	I don't want to play iPad.
5727216	5727476	All right.
5727776	5730778	Ray Iannami says, oh, whoops, that was a personal tweet here.
5730938	5733380	Just it had at OLR in it here.
5733460	5736902	ShadowSniper says, your thoughts on Hitman 5 and what you would like to see in the new game?
5737502	5738103	There's a Hitman 5?
5738423	5740444	I didn't even know there was a Hitman 5 coming out.
5741605	5742806	I didn't play Hitman 1 through 4.
5743066	5744106	It's not really my type of game.
5744166	5745587	Loki, that's more of your alley.
5745807	5750249	No, it's a stealth action game, so that's not really my forte.
5750329	5751530	What would I like to see in the new game?
5751590	5752811	Lots of sex and violence.
5752951	5754531	That always makes for a great video game, right?
5754912	5757333	Not Timothy Orban, whatever his name is.
5757373	5758453	Yes, and more lesbians.
5759834	5768678	TigerClaw305 tweets us, GTA is being shown to school children to teach them about violence and links us to this news story here from VG247.com.
5770479	5770559	What?
5770579	5772420	Like I had to check to make sure this wasn't dated April 1st.
5794338	5794638	What?
5794658	5798361	They fight and fight and fight and fight and fight.
5798381	5798941	Fight, fight, fight.
5798961	5799822	Fight, fight, fight.
5799842	5804385	Just a guess, but I don't think you show people violence to get them not desensitized to violence.
5804845	5808748	That kind of is the opposite of what you want to do.
5808768	5818995	You know what they did when I was young to scare the shit out of me, and this wasn't necessarily about violence, but it was violent, when they would teach us the responsibility of having a driver's license is they'd show us red asphalt.
5819575	5821156	Oh, we laughed through that.
5821776	5823037	You're not supposed to laugh.
5823077	5823978	It's disgusting.
5825719	5827400	I would not watch it.
5827560	5829961	I just would kind of look away and not really watch it.
5829981	5831622	It was disgusting.
5831642	5834644	Remember that every 15 minutes they teach you about drunk driving?
5834664	5836665	I'm like, you're wasting so much time.
5836825	5837746	I don't care.
5838166	5838647	I get it.
5838907	5840468	This person had alcohol.
5840788	5844130	They got in a fictional drunk driving accident.
5844290	5844990	It's sad.
5845170	5845871	It happens.
5846271	5848913	Why do I have to sit here for two hours while you talk about it?
5849393	5850273	They didn't do that at my school.
5850293	5851154	Did they actually drink?
5851874	5852334	No, they didn't.
5852755	5853315	Here's what they did.
5853355	5854295	This is great.
5855336	5857877	And this is from how I understand that they did it.
5858037	5859417	It could be a little different.
5859698	5865300	Okay, first they came out on our football field because we had our stadium and whatever.
5865320	5870362	They had everybody sit there and they had this big thing covered up with a tarp or something.
5870742	5874124	So they pulled the tarp off and it's this horrible car accident.
5874664	5876665	Like this person mangled or whatever.
5876685	5878846	Of course, it's just a person with makeup on and whatnot.
5879786	5884810	And then an ambulance comes and they realistically pull them out of the wreckage and stuff like that.
5885950	5889953	And then later on... Was it like one of the students?
5890033	5892215	Yeah, it was one of the students.
5892355	5893155	Or it was somebody.
5893956	5897959	Anyways, and then later on they have this grim reaper walking around the entire day.
5898379	5901901	And every 15 minutes they would take a student and pull them out of class.
5902041	5903682	And they were basically dead.
5903922	5905784	And they wouldn't be there for the rest of the week.
5906044	5907345	Or however long it was.
5907385	5908766	You had to get out of school for a week?
5909546	5912868	Okay, but, you know, it's like punishment, basically.
5914169	5917011	And I don't know if... Wait, punishment?
5917271	5917872	Well, no, hold on.
5917892	5919873	What did you do to get the Grim Reaper to tap you?
5920233	5922935	Oh, Matt didn't do his homework, you come with me, kid.
5923395	5930580	No, so here's what really happened from what I hear, and I don't know if this is entirely accurate because it's really fucked up if it is.
5932001	5938966	Basically, they took him to some sort of location, a cabin or whatever, and made him write notes to their parents or something like that.
5939506	5941868	Dear Mom, I am dead
5956360	5958181	Hi Mom, I died at school today.
5958221	5961824	The Grim Reaper took me out of class because I drank and drove.
5961864	5964866	They wrote letters to their parents later on about stuff like that.
5965206	5974773	But apparently the impression I was under is that the police went to their house and told their parents that they were dead.
5975934	5979897	Should they be out trying to catch real drunk drivers?
5980818	5982700	Anyways, you know what they did at my school?
5982960	5984841	They would have the really mean, fugly P.E.
5984861	5996491	teacher come in and say, they would say, if you drink and drive, you're going to go to jail, and you're going to stay there forever, and you're going to have a criminal record, and if you drink and drive, you're an idiot.
5996571	5997572	It took five minutes.
5997672	6000094	Anyways, yeah, okay, I understand that, and that makes perfect sense.
6000194	6003457	So not only do we have to sit through this two-hour long, you know,
6006032	6010895	Don't do it because you'll get two assemblies that you'll have to sit through
6035720	6041965	No, but honestly though, I mean, duh, drinking and driving impairs you and you can die, okay, or kill somebody.
6042426	6047450	I mean, any sane person that has some sort of common sense gets that.
6047910	6056718	However, nowadays kids are not being raised with common sense, so it's no wonder that they have to have multiple assemblies in order for this to sink in.
6056778	6058739	And even then, it's just not going to.
6058759	6058839	Yeah.
6059600	6060040	Well, that's okay.
6060100	6062001	I'm just going to smoke pot instead.
6062742	6063462	That's better.
6064723	6066564	I'm not drinking and driving at all.
6067364	6068205	Fuck you, Grim Reaper.
6070806	6071947	What were we talking about before?
6072087	6072767	I don't remember.
6074728	6081592	I was trying to see if they had that clip that I remember from the 90s that was... Yeah, I think it's this.
6082893	6084774	This was very much like what they did at my school.
6084794	6085454	I think it's this clip.
6085973	6088114	So, Beavis and Butthead.
6089114	6092736	I understand Mr. McVicar has made a little arrangement with you guys.
6092856	6094276	Yeah, a little probation.
6095137	6100319	You see, class, Beavis and Butthead here are not allowed to laugh for a whole week.
6101283	6110414	That's right, and if they do laugh, they'll be expelled, and they'll have to go to Hope High School where they'll get their asses kicked on a daily basis by all the other delinquents.
6110494	6111455	Ha ha ha!
6111855	6113998	Well, I was real glad to hear that, because this is Sex Education Week.
6114018	6114799	That's right, Sex Ed Week!
6121104	6122926	We're going to be talking about the penis!
6123986	6126048	We'll be talking about the vagina!
6126669	6128450	Do you think that's funny, butthead?
6128730	6132113	Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking about the testicles?
6133194	6144824	Yes, we're also going to be talking about venereal disease, sexual intercourse, and we will definitely be spending a lot of time talking about masturbation!
6148303	6149364	That's what they did in my school.
6149624	6150885	See, this is great.
6151225	6155728	See, this is the type of letter, actually, that they had the right for the every 15 minutes program.
6155768	6160211	Dear Mom and Dad, every 15 minutes, someone dies as a result of an alcohol-related collision.
6160451	6163873	Today, I died and I never got the chance to tell you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6165194	6166315	and that's what made them all upset.
6166475	6167196	It was annoying.
6167496	6167936	Trust me.
6168216	6171739	If you go through high school, at least... Just get the gym teacher in there for five minutes.
6171799	6172800	Scare the hell out of everyone.
6173660	6175101	Do you want to see me again?
6175362	6176723	Do you want to see me again?
6177883	6179705	Hey, we have some other tweets.
6180485	6185089	MNZiba follows that with a question about Pokemon RO.
6188188	6191930	Plugging the old Pokemon RO telling us that you can actually win a beta account.
6191950	6193670	Apparently they're doing a test, a little thing there.
6193690	6195731	But the thing they linked us to didn't work.
6196132	6196892	But here's my thing.
6197332	6198653	For some reason the link didn't work.
6198693	6200213	But here's my question about Pokemon RO.
6200854	6203315	Didn't one of these Pokemon operations get shut down recently?
6203355	6204815	Like there was a Pokemon MMO going on?
6204955	6205175	Yes.
6205215	6208077	Like isn't this kind of a dangerous thing to be running right now in light of that?
6208097	6208357	Possibly.
6208437	6208997	Like I'm just saying.
6209037	6210658	Like I hope it doesn't get shut down.
6210698	6212439	I wouldn't like to see that happen to this.
6212519	6215340	But I'm just saying if Nintendo did the other one, just...
6215620	6216922	Be careful, kids.
6217002	6221828	I've seen some of the in-game stuff that looks pretty Ragnarok-y, pretty good.
6222182	6222402	Yeah.
6223722	6223983	All right.
6224363	6225863	Anyhow, that's it for Twitter topics tonight.
6225883	6227023	Thank you guys so much for the tweets.
6227063	6228184	And sorry I didn't get to everything.
6228204	6230624	But, well, we had to play the clip from Beavis and Butthead.
6230845	6234126	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us in the future.
6234786	6235026	All right.
6235486	6241948	Giovedea in our chat room says, I took a college class where we had to yell tits, ass, penis, vagina, and all that on the first day of class.
6242828	6244669	Sex education in college is actually a lot of fun.
6244809	6245649	And it's educational.
6246536	6247557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6273114	6287335	so they had a transsexual come in teacher shut the door and said okay for the next hour you can ask anything you want and this person has agreed to answer any gross curiosity, whatever you've ever wanted to know now it's time to ask it so they asked everything everything
6288208	6290148	But it was a highly educational day, I'll tell you that.
6290849	6292709	I think it's going to be that forthcoming.
6292789	6297990	Our sixth grade sex ed was hilarious because we had a female teacher.
6298050	6300931	So the female teacher took the girls and explained the girls stuff.
6301311	6308412	And then apparently some kid's father was the person we had teaching the male portion of it.
6308512	6309753	And the guy was a pervert.
6311193	6311953	And that was funny.
6312830	6320254	Yeah, they used to split up the class for us too, but I just... And then the teacher found out the guy was a pervert, and that was the end of sex ed.
6322134	6326336	You guys might find this funny, but when I was in sex ed, you know what test I did?
6326937	6328738	We had six different tests throughout class.
6328758	6332359	Do you know which test I got the lowest score on out of all the tests that they gave out in class?
6332839	6333480	Male anatomy?
6333720	6333880	No.
6334540	6335181	Vagina week.
6335481	6336001	Vagina week?
6338652	6339374	You'd find that funny.
6339935	6340918	I thought y'all would get a kick out of that.
6340938	6342401	I find that ironic.
6344113	6346294	Hey, gaming news, once in a while.
6348716	6349997	It happens, believe it or not.
6350037	6352198	We talk about video game news on this program.
6352999	6355060	Oh, God, what happened to this show, Loki?
6356862	6363606	So, what's kind of neat is there's a rumor that Microsoft's live support is coming to the free games that you get with Windows.
6363966	6369890	Yes, you may remember all those wonderful classics as Solitaire, Minesweeper, Chess, etc.
6370391	6373272	Some of these I have never heard of, I guess because I don't have Windows 7, like,
6374413	6375114	Purple Place?
6375294	6377855	Purple Place, yeah, it's one of the new Windows 7 games.
6379356	6380877	And Windows has Mahjong now?
6381217	6383018	Yep.
6383439	6384079	It's on Vista.
6385220	6386320	No, I haven't used Vista yet.
6386340	6386901	It's on Vista and 7.
6387121	6390743	It's basically the old Shanghai game, but now Microsoft brand.
6391283	6398788	So, yeah, I wonder if that means, yeah, apparently they're going to not only get achievements, but chat and leaderboard support.
6400901	6422602	So now I can chat with people while playing Solitaire and have leaderboards Interesting that they're going to integrate this Solitaire is a huge game on Windows It's probably the number one Windows game above anything else you can think of WoW, Halo, anything you can think of Solitaire is probably a bigger game then
6424161	6425702	Should have been working now.
6425742	6426082	Achievement.
6448018	6449919	Played solitaire between the hours of 8 a.m.
6449959	6450600	and 5 p.m.
6450640	6451500	Achievement unlocked.
6454702	6460065	Anyhow, Microsoft, of course, isn't the only one that has a gaming network that is continuing to grow and develop.
6460425	6463167	But another big company is launching their own game network.
6463227	6463867	It's Apple.
6463947	6464347	That's right.
6464748	6470311	One of the big things that was announced as part of the new iPhone 4.0 OS is Game Center.
6471231	6485758	Game Center is going to be a single online gaming experience for the Apple devices that will kind of link all these games together you'll be able to invite and track friends you'll have matchmaking with this leaderboards and achievements that's right it's very own achievements
6487860	6511378	What's kind of interesting about this is that systems like this already exist somewhat in Apple's world I don't know if any of you guys grabbed the Commodore 64 emulator that's available on the Apple It was free a couple days ago, I think just for like last weekend, so I grabbed it It uses a technology called OpenFaint, which I believe is by the people who made AuroraFaint Which was one of the very early, early iPhone games that was out there
6511718	6523604	That was the same type of thing Somebody to develop this platform Well, what happened is that now you have OpenFaint And you have these other competing platforms as well And so Apple has finally just decided to step in and say You know what?
6523784	6539071	Actually, I think we're going to do our own thing Not just to steal a good idea But I think to kind of They probably see what's happening with the developers And that more and more game developers want to be on OpenFaint or something like this So Apple probably just wants to standardize it across the board
6539771	6543553	Well, it affects their branding, I think.
6544714	6549457	Yeah, and as much as you want to kind of say, well, they're big and evil for wanting to basically shut down OpenFaint.
6549477	6556621	Well, they're not really shutting down OpenFaint, but they're really trying to render it irrelevant, although I'm sure OpenFaint will still be around for some things.
6557841	6560083	I think Apple is very big on consistency.
6560717	6564858	Hence why they have such a rigid review thing for apps.
6564978	6568419	There's a reason why your apps all kind of look and feel the same.
6568920	6572661	It's because it's not like you get to make whatever buttons you want.
6572941	6574921	There are limitations to what you get to do with apps.
6575742	6577522	And I think it's to give consistency.
6578122	6583304	And so I think Apple wants to take kind of reign of this to bring that same consistency because it works well for them.
6584963	6591154	But of course, there's always that controversy because they don't really publish a lot of those guidelines and what exactly they look for when they screen things.
6592799	6596461	By the way, some other things that were announced that will affect gamers on the iPhone.
6596481	6601804	I mean, obviously there's multitasking was the big thing, although I got a 3G, so I'm screwed on that one.
6601844	6602624	I'm not going to get that.
6602964	6606486	Hopefully they announce a new iPhone in June because I'm eligible for an upgrade in October.
6606706	6607607	I don't really want to just upgrade.
6607627	6608847	But it works for the 3GS.
6608948	6611709	It will work for the 3GS, but I know Apple.
6611909	6615211	There will be another newer, nicer iPhone within the year.
6615811	6617292	So I got to hold out for that.
6617492	6619514	They've got that in common with Nintendo, don't they?
6621355	6622856	So, yeah.
6622956	6626479	I really, really, really want to get an iPad because I'm a big fucking sheep.
6627219	6627920	But I'm going to wait.
6628080	6633144	I'm going to wait until next year because I just know that camera on the front will be on next year's iPad.
6633264	6641850	Well, Dan and I were actually talking about how we both want one, but we're specifically going to wait until another generation goes by.
6643551	6646774	And then we're probably going to get them.
6647941	6652024	Also, by the way, just so you know, not just the multitasking, voice over IP in the background.
6652144	6654225	Like, you can have Skype running and get calls on Skype.
6654265	6654886	It's pretty neat.
6655446	6657247	And, again, no, not on 3G.
6657828	6661951	And folders to organize your stuff better, which is actually really helpful.
6662151	6666013	See, I think a lot of what they're incorporating, though, is stuff that they've actually stolen from the jailbreakers.
6666874	6668095	Yeah, I'm not surprised.
6668355	6677181	My friend's got a jailbroken iPhone, and it's got folders and all kinds of stuff with it, and he can use it as a storage device, and it's kind of crazy.
6677201	6677281	Yeah.
6677928	6678789	Um, and what was the other one?
6678849	6679290	Oh, ads.
6679710	6680431	The iAds.
6680511	6684696	Now they're gonna have, uh, Apple's gonna have its own ad platform because I guess they just didn't like AdMob.
6685678	6687640	No, they wanted, it's not they didn't like it, they wanted a piece of it.
6688261	6689062	But no Flash!
6690543	6691384	It's very interesting.
6691404	6699369	I don't want to get too techy on you guys, but it's very interesting how Apple is kind of kicking down Adobe and they're also kicking down Google.
6699389	6711356	Did you know that they are taking out... I mean, you still will be able to search on the new iPhone 4.0 OS and you can use Google as a search engine, but the button will not say... It says Google right now.
6711376	6712297	It doesn't say anything else.
6712797	6716039	But they're opening it up for you to use Bing, Yahoo, whatever.
6717940	6718801	This one's pretty cool.
6720017	6724140	I do like the stuff that's coming with the 4.0 OS.
6724480	6728742	I'm a little bummed that it won't work on my phone, but at the same time, I'm getting a little irritated with my phone.
6728762	6729463	It locks up.
6729523	6730063	It's slow.
6730864	6731244	I don't know.
6731304	6733965	I might need to wipe it and reinstall everything.
6734005	6736207	I don't know what the hell is making it run so crappy.
6736607	6738368	But yet, here I am, still a sheep.
6738468	6741250	Could it be the Apple-created CPU inside of it?
6743237	6749982	I might have all these problems, but at the end of the day, dang, I'll tell you, I use my iPhone so freaking much.
6750882	6753324	It's a great little device to have in my pocket, I will say that.
6754605	6755885	Anyhow, let's move on.
6756066	6758047	Something non-Apple related, DarkSakura.
6758407	6762290	Well, there are some pretty big Final Fantasy fans out and about.
6762950	6766212	And there's one person who's doing a very interesting translation of it.
6766713	6769214	They are doing Final Fantasy in Latin.
6769895	6770275	Latin.
6771693	6773434	Yeah.
6774455	6778818	It's of course going to be a ROM with Patch, but it's in Latin.
6780419	6780719	Okay.
6780739	6781280	That's hardcore.
6783661	6788304	It just makes me think of Eddie as they're talking about being mugged and saying something to them in Latin.
6788605	6789685	Oh no, he knows Latin!
6789705	6789766	Run!
6792028	6801806	But I like the little line that, excuse me, I must be allergic to Latin, that Destructoid has in their little article about it.
6801826	6804271	It says, now can I get a copy of Alundra and Esperanto?
6805879	6806179	Nice.
6807960	6810041	Isn't Esperanto like a completely made up language?
6810061	6813482	Like it's not something that is like... It was meant to be a universal language.
6813662	6815863	So it takes elements from different... I see.
6816403	6818744	And actually it's... I'll tell you what, Rob.
6818904	6823306	You can look right now at a page in Esperanto and get an idea of what they're talking about.
6823546	6823826	I see.
6824206	6825947	Because it derives a little bit from every language.
6826267	6826707	Exactly.
6826767	6827567	Well, that's kind of neat.
6827907	6830048	And I know people who are learning it, so... That's cool.
6830368	6831309	It sounds cool.
6832129	6833410	I had a friend that spoke it, actually.
6833570	6834510	It was interesting to hear.
6836297	6838458	I want to call her an Esperanto.
6839698	6841759	I do not because I have to talk to the call.
6841979	6844179	Jamie, if somebody calls an Esperanto, you're talking to them.
6845620	6849001	I'll say, uh, si, si, no.
6850221	6854222	Anyhow, Loki, something in English, please.
6855334	6859618	Yes, Fear 3 has been announced coming from Warner Brothers.
6860478	6871809	And what's kind of neat about the new franchise in this horror shooter game is actually it's going to be including cinematics created by John Carpenter.
6872409	6872909	Thanks for watching!
6892605	6897027	So, pretty good pedigree there, and I know the franchise has been pretty good.
6897387	6908292	Hell, Fear 2 had some pretty awesome multiplayer in it, especially with all the maps with the Toy Soldier maps, and the theme song for that trailer, which I still can't get out of my head.
6911374	6914515	Looking forward to it, and no time frame yet when it's been announced.
6914535	6920318	It's supposed to be scheduled to be coming out in the fall, probably around November or so, on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
6924195	6926477	This is the game you probably pick up?
6926577	6927697	I haven't played the other ones.
6928438	6933621	I've been kind of curious to check it out, especially number two, but maybe I'll check it out.
6933701	6934022	I don't know.
6935243	6938725	Well, more information coming out on Red Dead Redemption.
6938765	6940846	Of course, this game was also shown off at PAX East.
6940866	6942728	That was probably one of those other games that Loki would have liked to see.
6942848	6943128	Oh, yes.
6943748	6948572	Well, they announced, though, this week that multiplayer free roam is going to be a feature in Red Dead Redemption.
6948932	6950613	I believe that's also in Grand Theft Auto 4, correct?
6951774	6953095	It's something similar.
6953415	6964883	It sounds very similar to free mode in Grand Theft Auto 4, but this one's almost... I would say it's closer to, like, party mode in Grand Theft Auto 4, where you can kind of join in.
6965043	6966023	Let me describe it a little bit here.
6966084	6970266	You can explore the full single-player game world, but you'll be in a multiplayer environment.
6970286	6970987	That sounds kind of like the...
6972808	6973309	on Xbox.
6973329	6974190	She's kind of like that too.
6974931	6977114	But it's separate from the single player story mode.
6977214	6985026	So in free roam, you can either go in by yourself or you band together with friends together in eight and then you can take on other little bands.
6985146	6988651	You can either hunt down criminals together or just, you know, shoot the shit out of each other.
6989611	7012959	16 players in the same lobby at once yeah and you get experience points as you do these different multiplayer modes 50 levels of character progressions the new xp will unlock new weapons mounts characters and challenges yeah it sounds very similar to the party mode in Grand Theft Auto 4 because you can basically jump into um it's it's like a lobby but it's basically just a portion of the Grand Theft Auto map and if you really want to you can just
7013599	7017943	Hang around in the lobby and drive all over the entire map or do whatever.
7018043	7022546	So this is going to be very similar to that where you can kind of play more of a freeform version of the game.
7022826	7034075	Plus they have areas where it will launch different things like deathmatch modes or hunting or, you know, I believe there's like a capture the gold type mode in there.
7034175	7035356	So it'll be very cool.
7036376	7036697	Alright.
7037277	7039859	I'm looking to try to mod this game to put a car into it.
7040520	7050567	Just because I know the engine that they're using is probably extremely similar to Grand Theft Auto and if it's anything like that game was set up, it should be very easy to do something similar like that.
7051368	7052709	You and your freaking hacks.
7053109	7055711	It would be hilarious for rocket launchers or something.
7056892	7057172	All right.
7057973	7063798	Well, let's get to the segment of the show that doesn't involve cars or bringing things into places they shouldn't be.
7064398	7065079	Except spam.
7065099	7068562	We do get a lot of spam that shouldn't be in the mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
7068582	7073786	That's mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is our email address for you to send your emails to every week.
7073866	7076048	We read our favorites here on the show and respond to them.
7076809	7081273	Dark Sakura likes to dive into the mailbag and pull out some of her favorites and read them right now.
7081313	7084675	Again, mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you would like to participate sometime.
7085543	7088004	DSMaster26 sent an email.
7089405	7090766	Try not to sound too excited about it.
7091226	7098149	It's very badly written and it's giving me a headache, so I think I might just translate it into real English.
7098169	7099270	Okay, go for it.
7100891	7100951	Um...
7101967	7103348	I could try and read it the way it's written.
7104129	7104750	I could do it.
7105110	7105390	Okay.
7106071	7119903	Okay, as it's written, Dear C4 and OLR crew, I am giving a giant F you to is Microsoft because of them raping me in the ass for 15 minutes.
7119943	7121104	Okay, I can't take it anymore.
7121144	7121685	Translate, please.
7122245	7122505	Okay.
7123586	7128028	Um... Dear Olarkra, I'm giving a giant F you to Microsoft because they're raping me in the ass for 50 bucks a year.
7128149	7129009	That is crap.
7129389	7131691	I'm regretting getting a 360.
7131851	7135133	I should have bought... It's spelled B-O-U, not B-A-U.
7135433	7136473	Bought the PS3.
7138054	7139975	At least you should have instead of should of.
7140115	7140675	I hate that.
7141215	7144335	It is should have, would have, could have.
7144436	7146616	So he doesn't get an F. Just a D minus.
7146636	7147256	He gets a D minus.
7148296	7150277	So thank you for at least avoiding one of my pet peeves.
7151837	7153157	Here are the reasons why... Okay.
7156638	7157138	Cry.
7158499	7159139	Web browser.
7160059	7164500	No, it's regions, R-E-G-I-O-N, not R-E-G-I-N.
7165340	7182568	Um, Locking, New Beat Mania, 2DX17, Free Online Play, No Cost, Netflix Without Paying for PSN, and finally, that's all wrong, and finally, 5, um, Bluetooth, okay, god, this sucks.
7184569	7187550	Punctuation, do you speak it?
7188030	7188471	Thank you.
7191059	7199826	Many phones have Bluetooth, therefore, therefore ends in an E, by the way, I can use the headset for both my phone and PS3.
7201427	7207451	I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for Bimani titles for PS3 and 360.
7208752	7214173	Please help, I'm on a Bimani binge ever since I played 2DX17 at the arcade in Omaha.
7214353	7214594	Help.
7214794	7216254	Peace out, DSMaster26.
7216294	7219815	There's really not a lot available on the 360 and PS3.
7220115	7222776	I will tell you, no way in hell should you spend any money on Beat and Groovy.
7223536	7225276	Honestly, I like DJ Hero a lot.
7225316	7231298	I know that's not Bimani, technically, but as far as music game goes, it's really the best with Rock Band.
7232679	7236561	If you're looking for DDR and stuff, there's just not a lot of great stuff.
7236581	7242085	You can go for Dance Dance Revolution Universe, and I would say Universe 2 is probably the best of the series.
7243666	7248069	You can get Universe 3 very easily, though, but it's on the auto games or whatever.
7248089	7251511	Karaoke Revolution, if you like that kind of stuff.
7251811	7252792	I don't know.
7253152	7253673	Not my favorite.
7253693	7261258	And if you really want the True Bomani experience that they've brought to you straight to the next-gen system, then Rock Revolution is definitely a title for you.
7263320	7266483	That'll basically tell you what they think of the new systems.
7266803	7267805	There's a PS on here.
7269226	7269546	Okay.
7269887	7272930	I challenge Mel B to a perfect attack and freestyle DDR match.
7273050	7273771	He will go down.
7274151	7274932	Not bloody likely.
7276814	7278316	How do you perfect attack and freestyle?
7279002	7280644	Perfect Attack, Freestyle
7296341	7297903	Um, you know, I haven't asked him.
7298183	7300986	I think he listens to this show, though, so maybe he can email us and tell us.
7301046	7307612	I think he still kind of follows it, but I don't think he really... Well, yeah, he does a lot of DJing gigs and stuff.
7307712	7310054	Not DJ Hero, but real, actual DJing.
7311115	7312737	I know that's a big hobby of his now.
7314158	7315039	Where are they now?
7315560	7317561	That would be a fun segment to do on OLR someday.
7317622	7318402	Where are they now?
7318422	7319403	Where is Jahi?
7322379	7322960	Oh, good question.
7323000	7324761	I haven't heard from Jahi in a long time.
7324781	7325201	You know what?
7325221	7326222	Maybe we need to do this.
7326302	7327542	It's like an OLR special.
7327562	7328583	Maybe for our anniversary.
7328643	7332926	Like, find Bomani people from back in the day and do like a Where Are They Now segment.
7333226	7336708	But like, a lot of our newer listeners wouldn't understand.
7337069	7337689	Who cares?
7337709	7339630	Well, I broke out the orange bat, Rob.
7339910	7340651	I broke out the orange bat.
7340671	7341672	I know you did.
7341732	7343473	Well, you know, Wendell.
7343733	7344213	Oh, my God.
7344413	7345554	Have you seen Wendell lately?
7345574	7346835	Uh-uh.
7346895	7347075	Oh, yeah.
7347115	7347976	I heard he lost a lot of weight.
7347996	7348996	He's looking pretty good.
7350097	7350698	Step Squad RTF Reunion
7368334	7397468	well something like that we wouldn't necessarily have to do it here like we could find a place to remote broadcast we'd go to Sweet Tomatoes where could we I don't know we'll have to find a big space that used to be where we'd all meet up to go to dinner like years and years ago we'd go to Sweet Tomatoes and Concord let's figure something out we're gonna do that for our next anniversary show I bet number nine I should go on DDR Freak and post something NorCal famous DDR players wanted for a reunion special or something like that that'd be fun
7398399	7400112	I keep a lot more on my Facebook.
7400714	7402075	Hmm, I just, where can we do it?
7402095	7405157	Because there's too many people to have here, and I don't have a big garage anymore.
7405337	7406217	Dave and Busters!
7408078	7409339	We could do a roadshow.
7409459	7410700	I'm set up to do that because of PAX.
7410720	7414202	We could do a roadshow, and on top of that, I think I'll have my... We just couldn't do that live.
7414282	7420325	I think I, actually, au contraire, I may have my Wi-Fi tether on my phone working.
7421086	7421226	Ooh.
7421286	7423387	They have a Wi-Fi tether for the 3GS.
7423427	7425929	That would be tough to do 96K to all games.
7425949	7427710	That would be tough on a Wi-Fi tether.
7428670	7428950	I don't know.
7430272	7433294	I bet if anybody knows how to do it, Scott probably does because I think he's done it before.
7433415	7434736	So I'll talk to him about it.
7435757	7436237	We'll see.
7437979	7438219	All right.
7439649	7446451	Also, now, I got... I had received the first email that you sent me before, but I've just been so wiped out and busy.
7446851	7457294	But the man that I met at the Atari party, Sal, he sent an email, and he sent me some stuff that I want to... Was that the music guy?
7457534	7459195	Yeah, I totally want to interview him.
7459335	7467457	As soon as... If I was not flat broke, I would be... I want to order one of the systems that he's got, because he's doing games for the...
7469638	7471860	and Atari 800 XL.
7473341	7474381	Working on OutRun.
7474842	7478544	Has a version of Space Harrier that's actually really sweet.
7478584	7479805	Complete with voice, by the way.
7480745	7481886	I'm very impressed.
7482907	7484808	So I'll go ahead and actually give them a plug.
7485068	7492092	It's KJ Mann's Atari Sales and Electronics.
7492112	7492813	You'll find them on eBay.
7492853	7494614	It's just K-J-M-A-N-N-S-H.
7495094	7495955	He's really cool.
7496455	7501539	And the stuff, the ports that he's worked with are just amazing.
7501760	7502280	They're amazing.
7503861	7504562	I'm very impressed.
7505663	7506644	We'll try to get him on the show.
7506684	7507124	It'll be fun.
7507324	7507504	Yeah.
7508085	7510547	We'll get him to come to this OLRCon we're suddenly planning.
7511528	7512228	OLRCon!
7512889	7515691	I wonder how much it costs to rent, like, a big hall somewhere.
7515911	7517172	Maybe we should call it OLRCon.
7517192	7518293	Just do OLRCon.
7518413	7518934	For real.
7519034	7521356	Like, just fucking do it already.
7521876	7524038	My brain just suddenly made OLRCon Asylum.
7526252	7526592	I don't know.
7526632	7527513	We'll have to think about it.
7527773	7532176	How could we do OLRCon and not have it fail miserably where we're going to spend a lot of money on it?
7532236	7532536	I don't know.
7532556	7533256	We have to think about this.
7534217	7536779	Okay, so I think it's King of Rush.
7537199	7538600	Okay.
7538760	7542402	Said, why was Rob's mom pwning all of us with that last phrase?
7543483	7545284	That must have been texted or something during the show.
7546445	7547305	Because she's my mother.
7547365	7548526	It's where I get my sense of humor from.
7549986	7563324	And Don't You Dare Talk Trash About Her Dude, Rob's mom is such a nice lady She's fun So, I got one from Robaba That's an Orange Lounge Radio Wordle
7565106	7568327	And, dude, I love, oh, I love anything that's typography.
7568788	7569408	So this is so sweet.
7569488	7570128	Oh, I saw that.
7570188	7573530	It's like the art with all the common words from our website.
7573950	7574530	Yeah.
7574550	7576151	Kind of like if it's used a lot, then it's big.
7576171	7576431	If it's not.
7576451	7576991	B for you.
7577952	7584475	Well, I think B for you, at the time he did that, was like being highlighted as like the I love that song.
7584955	7587776	You know that segment that Dark Tetsuya and Actdeft and some people do for our site?
7588036	7588336	Yeah.
7588396	7588916	I love that song.
7588936	7592278	I think B for you was like the song that was up at the moment that that happened.
7592611	7593992	I'm totally going to save the pictures.
7594012	7604436	I mean, it's generated in Flash, but I have this little fun tool to grab images off by doing just a plain old screenshot of it.
7604876	7605657	You can crop them.
7605797	7607578	I love this thing, and I'm trying to remember.
7607618	7608638	I think it's called Pixlr.
7609218	7615301	It's a plug-in for whatever the crap this program is that I'm using.
7617318	7619360	But anyway.
7620961	7622342	But yeah, it's really cool.
7622382	7622863	I like it.
7624784	7630409	And I like that he puts a comment that I suppose that word will filter out curse words.
7632771	7634352	And then the last one is...
7638371	7640153	from somebody who hasn't put a name on here.
7641234	7645559	I'm just going to say Brandon, because that's the closest thing I can find.
7646320	7658833	Dear OLR, after listening to OLR Archive episode, I have started to have a money craze, so I spent my whole allowance, $30, on tokens, and I played some Beatmania 2DX, read, cranked...
7661655	7667977	Crank211, Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Parapara, DDR, Pop Music, and Keyboard Mania.
7668077	7669097	It was epic fun.
7670818	7675039	Rob, we need to go to Art Vigil soon.
7676099	7676599	We can go.
7676619	7677940	I mean, it's just down the street.
7678140	7679440	I know, but I want to play.
7680961	7682761	Rob, I've got to dance.
7687338	7687658	Alright.
7688740	7695267	Well, anyhow, let's move on to the part of the show where we get a little bit of angst off our chests.
7695327	7698170	It's the FUs of the week, and they're going to start right now.
7714208	7718710	F you to the big pile of carrot cake in my fridge.
7720711	7723272	Okay, I have eaten almost nothing but carrot cake all day.
7724212	7725713	Except when I came home and ate a rib.
7726833	7727874	I ate a rib.
7729114	7729794	Oh, and some chips.
7729995	7730955	Was it a tasty rib?
7731195	7732576	It was a very tasty rib.
7732616	7733316	It was delicious.
7734176	7736657	And I think he got kosher beef, too.
7736837	7737998	I mean, anyway, it was really good.
7738918	7739398	But anyway...
7742372	7744593	I can't eat any more cake.
7744753	7745253	I can't.
7745814	7746994	I don't think that I can.
7747675	7752818	And my tummy behaved very well yesterday despite all the beer that I drank.
7752838	7754719	I think all the beer broke everything else down.
7755159	7758461	But today I'm suffering for it, so... Fuck you, gluten!
7761863	7762283	Go ahead, Loki.
7763600	7768061	F you to the KFC special sauce that they put on the KFC Double Down.
7768502	7780765	It really ruined the Double Down, and it's unfortunate because it had potential to be a great unhealthy piece of chicken that I could have eaten, but instead it was just all nasty sauce that I tasted.
7781305	7786327	Maybe next time I will have to do the pseudo-Windows 7 burger and get a 7x7 from...
7789338	7791058	Oops, Holic came in early, my bad.
7791819	7792579	I was going to say that.
7793439	7795119	F you to Holic, playing early.
7795760	7804021	Anyways, yeah, so I should do a Windows 7 pseudo-burger from In-N-Out 7x7.
7804222	7807422	I've had a 4x4 before.
7807442	7810103	They're really not as filling as you would think.
7812432	7818555	My FU of the week goes to my confidence and self-esteem because I'm starting a new job tomorrow and I'm really nervous.
7818795	7821436	It's going to be like so different for me.
7821456	7822197	They're all going to laugh at you.
7822217	7823437	Yeah, they're all going to laugh at me.
7823637	7824898	No, I know I'll do fine.
7824918	7837284	But it's just – it's weird because like guys, seriously, the day job I've had – because, okay, it was funny because when I posted – I have listeners on my Facebook and when I posted to Facebook that I was leaving my old job, people were like, oh, you get to do OLR full time now?
7837324	7838205	And I'm like, ha!
7838425	7840047	Thank you for watching!
7863988	7870955	But anyway, on a serious note, I have a day job and the day job I've had, I've had for the past like seven years.
7871216	7874859	So almost as long as OLR has been going on, which is a fucking long time, just so you know.
7875820	7876681	And I'm changing that.
7876721	7882067	I'm doing a new job starting tomorrow and it's kind of nerve wracking, but I think it'll be good.
7882735	7890540	I'm excited about what the new position is and obviously I don't like to talk a lot about my day job on the show because I don't want no presents showing up at my workplace.
7891660	7892240	Or bombs.
7892541	7892941	Yeah.
7893821	7894422	Please no.
7894522	7895182	Just no.
7896203	7900445	So anyhow, yeah, I mean, I think it's great that people send gifts, but I don't know.
7900465	7902346	It's just something weird about having my address out there.
7902366	7904127	I just like to know who you are.
7904547	7905748	It was also on my business card.
7906348	7908349	Well, our Orange Lounge Radio business card.
7908389	7909250	So you think one of our...
7909890	7911591	If someone could have gotten it, I don't know.
7911631	7911952	Who knows?
7912052	7912332	All right.
7912372	7913593	Anyhow, I'm over it.
7913993	7914273	All right.
7914313	7915354	That's it for the FU's of the week.
7915454	7916835	Couple more news stories for you guys.
7916855	7917916	Then the Skype line.
7918156	7922459	And believe it or not, our phone works again.
7922499	7923619	It was broken last week.
7923739	7924520	It works again.
7924540	7926601	877-GAME-OLR works.
7927202	7928623	Also, Orange Laundry on Skype.
7928763	7929703	Both of them will work.
7929723	7930644	But we're not taking calls yet.
7930684	7931545	We still got two more stories.
7931565	7931765	Loki.
7932566	7932726	Yes.
7933907	7938613	So let's talk a little bit about how not to do collector's editions.
7939033	7940075	That's right.
7940676	7941697	Splinter Cell Conviction.
7941877	7945201	It's a wonderful game coming out this coming week here.
7946443	7950628	And apparently they're dropping $10 off the price of the collector's edition because...
7950988	7955850	Guess what the USB drive that they included with it is faulty.
7956130	7964193	Apparently there's a possibility of faulty USB drives included with the game and so they're knocking $10 off of it to kind of compensate for that.
7965013	7973756	And apparently none of the other content has been affected but the bonus content included on the USB drive may be inaccessible in some copies.
7976448	7978609	Well that turned out to be a bummer for someone didn't it?
7978789	8005722	Yeah that is a bummer and let me tell you this much you know from a distributor reseller standpoint that's going to be a fucking bitch when I come in on Monday because we're going to have to deal with all these credits to people that we sold the game to because Ubisoft fucked up so thank you Ubisoft appreciate it and whoever manufactured those little USB cards are going to get taken to the cleaners
8006718	8006799	Yeah.
8006819	8006920	Yeah.
8010911	8025722	and really the USB cards, what they have on them here, they've got a little artwork here, is a credit card size USB drive that had making of video, concept art, renders, screenshots, storyboards, and wallpapers.
8025842	8026963	Who gives a shit?
8027063	8030345	Well, can't you format that thing now and use it as storage on your 360?
8030465	8033227	No, you cannot because I don't believe it is over a gig.
8033327	8035389	You need at least a gig to be able to use it.
8035569	8036830	Sorry.
8037230	8040472	and you really want to have 16 gigs because you only get two cards, right?
8040492	8041112	Exactly.
8041132	8041953	Seems so weird to me.
8042833	8043314	So weird to me.
8043714	8050698	Well, it's kind of a slow news week and we found this article as a popular destination on Dig and I thought, what the hell, we'll bring it up on the show.
8050738	8056382	It's from IGN and it talks about the most anticipated Xbox Live arcade games that are coming up to the service.
8056422	8056842	Just things...
8057182	8057622	Sonic the Hedgehog 4
8083860	8086401	Very anticipated Xbox Live game.
8086581	8087001	Shank.
8088381	8090722	That was being shown at PAX earlier this year.
8091182	8092622	It's not Shaft, but Shank.
8093262	8094082	And he has a steel blade.
8094102	8094562	That's pretty awesome.
8094782	8095763	Yeah, it's very bloody.
8095983	8097103	Looks like your kind of game.
8097523	8100104	Hydrophobia, which was also shown at PAX East.
8100144	8102424	It's like kind of a Tomb Raider-ish type of game.
8103644	8105445	But she's afraid of the water, so no swimming.
8105605	8106925	That makes me think of Bioshock.
8108226	8109107	Puzzle Quest 2.
8109527	8109887	Don't care.
8110708	8112309	Hey, speak for yourself.
8112469	8114050	That's why I was speaking for myself.
8114110	8114670	I don't care.
8115130	8117132	I do care, so I'm excited about that.
8117772	8119493	Might and Magic, Clash of Heroes.
8119753	8119994	Don't care.
8120014	8120694	That looks pretty good.
8121535	8122775	Yeah, it looks like it could be interesting.
8124236	8126198	The art style looks really good.
8126738	8127999	They have it on the DS.
8128079	8128339	Yeah?
8128819	8128999	Yeah.
8130380	8146416	Super Meat Boy I have a custom coffee mug that I painted Super Meat Boy on Elsa on the other side has Eduardo the Samurai Toaster That's my WiiWare coffee mug that I made
8146576	8147336	And I'm actually kidding.
8147376	8149137	It looks interesting.
8149718	8150478	Comic Jumper.
8150798	8151519	I don't know this one.
8151539	8152699	That sounds kind of fun.
8152899	8154380	Oh, the Maw and Explosion Man?
8155160	8156421	That's a good developer there.
8156661	8157021	Okay.
8157782	8158702	Comedy Shooter.
8158722	8160303	Is that supposed to be like Earthworm Jim or something?
8160843	8161303	Probably.
8161544	8161864	Similar.
8162504	8164225	Monday Night Combat.
8164625	8165726	That looks awesome.
8165886	8167727	This one had a huge presence at PAX East.
8167767	8170928	And they had an announcer guy out there on the show floor and everything.
8171469	8174410	So it seems like all of these games were just PAX East games.
8176311	8176511	So funny.
8191906	8193767	Anyhow, the phones are now open.
8193787	8197870	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8197890	8202312	If you'd like to call to talk about, I don't know, anticipated Xbox Live arcade games or heck anything.
8202672	8209276	I know, you know, we were out two weeks ago and then last week we had some troubles with the phones and we were only able to take a couple calls.
8209717	8212158	So I'm sure there will be plenty of people who want to get through tonight.
8212218	8212678	And that's fine.
8212698	8215080	We have a little extra time for calls.
8215120	8218702	I don't want to do the show too late tonight, but we have some time for calls.
8219202	8235272	So again, 877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio It is now open and available for calls SHJ100Matt wants us to know He played MNC at PAX East And it was awesome Okay, phones are starting to ring Here we go Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio Who's this?
8236192	8238834	It's Ranma, looks like I got through the first time once again.
8238934	8242998	Look at you, you must have the least amount of lag or something.
8243418	8243979	Well, what's up?
8244940	8246121	Not too much, man.
8246401	8247982	A couple of things.
8248102	8254668	Now, to reference back to earlier in the episode, they did port Twilight Scenic to the Nintendo DS.
8254968	8256269	Came out about a couple of months ago.
8256449	8256670	Yeah.
8257190	8264093	I'm all for a Twilight game, provided it plays in a third-person shooter like Conker's Bad Fur Day, and I get to shoot them all up, then I'll buy that.
8282509	8283890	I was trying to call in, but, um...
8312873	8327195	on our podcast we covered this and my gaming girl who did some research on the article it seems that the company that did the game I think is Atomic Games they're backed by the CIA so I
8328357	8354498	Kinda thinking that this was all like a little setup, like a publicity stunt Well now hold on, cause didn't they say that because of what you're saying That it actually made this theft of the code a lot worse than it would be otherwise Like this kid is almost like being investigated by the FBI at this point Like I don't know, I might be throwing in some extra stuff there But like it seemed like from what we were reporting last week Like what he did wasn't just bad, it was really bad
8356345	8368415	Pretty much, but if you're going to cross-reference that in, I'm just saying, because of how this came out, and I don't know about you, but if this was a big deal, don't you think everybody at PAX would have been hearing about this?
8371170	8371931	Maybe they did.
8371991	8373751	Maybe it just happened at a time we weren't around.
8373811	8374232	I don't know.
8375452	8376793	I certainly didn't hear anything like that.
8377533	8380874	I didn't either, but at the same time, I was kind of in and out of there.
8380934	8382375	We left to eat.
8382775	8386356	I came in late a lot of days just because of the time zone thing.
8386396	8387017	I mean, I don't know.
8387637	8392159	It would be a really weird publicity stunt type of thing.
8393099	8395220	Weren't there court documents produced and everything, too?
8398021	8399002	I have no idea.
8399022	8400443	I have not heard anything about it.
8400663	8402284	There's actually court documents.
8402464	8405965	I will believe this guy actually did something stupid, you know?
8406366	8409147	But if there are no court documents, I call shenanigans.
8409267	8413569	I see where you're coming from, though, is that how could someone be so colossally stupid?
8413629	8414690	It just seems so fake.
8416431	8418052	Some people are that stupid, Ranma.
8418372	8419132	It's sad but true.
8420013	8420273	I know.
8420313	8421874	I used to work with people like that.
8422574	8423035	Pretty much.
8437794	8438474	Very interesting.
8438914	8440315	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, my friend?
8443256	8444196	That's pretty much it.
8444716	8445036	That's all.
8445616	8448757	Actdeft in our chat wants to say, Matt posted the court files earlier.
8448997	8451958	He's probably digging up the links again right now, so stay tuned to our chat room.
8451978	8453678	Yeah, I'll definitely be following that.
8453798	8454078	All right.
8454619	8455279	All right, take care, buddy.
8455899	8456179	You too.
8456319	8456859	All right, bye-bye.
8458160	8459560	Let's go back to the phones.
8460060	8460980	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8461000	8461360	Who's this?
8463441	8464881	Hi, it's Ray Iannami.
8465081	8466202	Hey, Ray Iannami.
8466222	8466842	What's on your mind, buddy?
8468934	8472515	I came out from SakuraCon last week, my first SakuraCon.
8473335	8475816	You went all the way up to Seattle to go to SakuraCon?
8477376	8478956	Yes, I went with some friends.
8480157	8482397	Didn't have, like, some friends up there, among other things.
8482897	8484858	Well, I don't know, you don't sound too happy.
8484938	8486378	Was it a good time, or what happened?
8487718	8488618	Oh, sorry, I'm just tired.
8488638	8494980	Plus, it's been a week, so... Anyway, SakuraCon's pretty cool, I guess.
8495200	8495300	Um...
8496775	8501638	I got to play quite a bit of games there like Tetris the Grandmaster 3 and some other crap.
8501658	8504559	I saw him hosting the anime match game panel but
8523306	8524166	No, that was my first time.
8524186	8525287	I was surprised at how big it was.
8525307	8528768	I could practically compare it to a shopping mall.
8528908	8530888	Especially since part of it is like a shopping mall.
8545129	8548252	Yeah, it's kind of integrated right into the downtown scene there, isn't it?
8548612	8550393	Well, tell us a little more about the gaming they had there.
8550413	8551675	Did they have, like, a big room?
8551695	8552575	Were they doing tournaments?
8552655	8553716	What was kind of going on with gaming?
8554617	8557259	Well, they had an arcade, but it wasn't too big.
8557299	8561182	It was, like, mostly DDR, Indie Groove.
8561823	8564765	They had a Pumped Up Pro 2 location test.
8565846	8571871	They had Initial D4, Guitar for Kings, Run Mania, and Patrick's Teach, M3, and myself already.
8572772	8573973	I would have played Pumped Up...
8574304	8585553	I was wearing costumes that involved dress shoes, and dress shoes and arrows popping games don't seem like a good idea.
8585573	8597563	I was cosplaying as Shell from Poppin' Music, the librarian guy, and Apollo Justice.
8598664	8600045	I was cosplaying as one character.
8601228	8604290	Cosmos is one character from Touhou, but I didn't have my costume prepared.
8605651	8613496	And sticking to the Touhou panel, there was one thing that I didn't like about it, and that was them trying to demonstrate the Touhou games.
8613996	8625084	They tried to demonstrate it by showing one of the game's later stages on lunatic difficulty, which is basically a difficulty level of a part, and as a small fan, it kind of pissed me off.
8625804	8628526	Because maybe they made the game look way harder than it really is?
8629955	8630795	Yeah, pretty much.
8630875	8637037	I mean, I'm pretty sure a lot of the people who weren't really into Danmaku games were just confused what the hell was going on.
8637917	8649260	I mean, if I was running, if I was, if I had a partner running the panel, I would have, like, alongside the Infamous stuff, I would also show, like, demonstration using easier stages and difficulty.
8649280	8655322	So now, like, something that requires effort to get through, but, like, it's still pretty watchable.
8656102	8658503	That way, people who are new to the series...
8659147	8666933	can have a grasp of what it's like to play the games instead of just being, oh, wow, pretty bullet, too bad I can't dodge any of that shit.
8669135	8676141	Yeah, it's... I gotta say, though, a lot of those shmups are so hard to me, but, you know, it takes talent.
8676201	8677582	To be good at them, though, takes talent.
8678483	8679003	That's for sure.
8680184	8687010	I mean, whenever I try to show people games, I don't go straight to, like, Horizon if it's a fighting game or
8687754	8689976	Showing them level 43 songs on Poppin'.
8690156	8693818	I try to show them easier stuff, something they can actually understand.
8694159	8708489	A few months ago, I was at an arcade with a friend of mine, and she went through to Poppin', so I demonstrated Poppin' to her using easier songs, even if it meant songs that I didn't find to be as fun as songs I usually play.
8708905	8709666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8733661	8756398	You know, the really low-end songs And that kind of goes with video games in general Like, if you don't want to scare someone off Like, you know they wouldn't like a shooter game Don't show them Halo or Gears of War Show them a video game that might be more their tastes You know, like, whether that be something like 1 versus 100 You know, might be a really good enabler for people to see that there's more to video games than that Or, you know, something on the Wii, I don't know
8757519	8758179	It is interesting.
8758219	8764084	I think sometimes people really scare people off from video games without realizing it because they go right for the hard stuff.
8764724	8766306	And a lot of people do get intimidated.
8767827	8782559	Yeah, there are IRC channels and forums I hang out at where people are not too good at video games, so I kind of get how they feel about not being able to get past the first season for some up on, even on easy difficulty.
8782579	8784280	Hmm.
8785211	8790816	Alright, well, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but, so, SakuraCon, do you think you'd try to go back next year?
8793539	8800585	Possibly if my spring break is around SakuraCon again, because that would be one big deciding factor in me going.
8800685	8803427	Last year it didn't line up with my spring break, so I didn't go.
8804148	8806170	So if the timing's right, it just might be in the cards.
8806590	8809613	Alright, well, we gotta let you go to get more calls, but take care, Ray, okay?
8811035	8829241	You too Alright, later Alright, I'll take a couple more calls here 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Take a few more calls here before we call it a night at OLR Studios Some last minute stories tonight we'll have in just a moment But first, another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8830762	8837064	Hi, yeah, this is Spazinator Hey, Spazinator, you're cutting in and out a little bit But we'll try to move ahead What's on your mind, buddy?
8838736	8844580	Sorry about that, I'm on the cell phone and unfortunately some stuff in my building interferes with the signal.
8845040	8845580	That's okay.
8845640	8853865	But anyway, I tried calling in last week to give you an update as to my PlayStation 3 situation.
8854085	8855766	Oh yeah, it's been a little while since we heard about that.
8855806	8857247	Yeah, we had our phone issues last week.
8857267	8858668	Well, what's the latest and greatest?
8858688	8862410	To make this short and sweet...
8863838	8886956	I'll probably gloss over the details, but the general points are that I got my PS3 back on the 30th, and a few days later they started putting my videos back onto my download queue, because the video store works differently than the game side of the store.
8887791	8897878	Anyway, it took a while for everything to show up because they had to do everything manually and reauthorize everything.
8897978	8907085	I get like over 700 videos, but needless to say, I got all my videos back, so I don't have to worry about that now.
8907965	8909466	Wow, 700 videos.
8909506	8910027	Oh my gosh.
8910387	8910647	Okay.
8912008	8914950	Yeah, well, not all those videos are paid for.
8914970	8915831	Some of those are...
8917344	8925452	No, like the freebies they gave out is like promotions to get you to buy the rest of the series, you know, whatever that series may be.
8926132	8940826	But needless to say, I got my reels back, and hopefully nothing goes wrong with the reel service in the future, but I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed on that, so...
8942345	8944107	Um, I'm sorry, Jamie.
8966704	8967924	This time around, not to the same extent.
8967944	8969545	Although I did keep what you and DarkSakura talked about.
8995891	8996791	Thank you for watching.
9015523	9031458	But in subsequent calls, speaking to other reps, just prior to me sending the machine in, they said, yeah, once you send the machine in and they send it back to me, they'll go through everything and reauthorize everything to download.
9032876	9046265	You know, I just have to interject here because as someone who has worked very closely with call centers in their day job, to me, that's a huge issue that you called in two times and got two different answers.
9046825	9052329	And for anybody, you know, Sony's a big company and who knows, we might have somebody at Sony who happens to listen to this program.
9052809	9053930	To me, that's a big issue.
9054090	9057152	You should not call a call center, speak to two different people and get two different answers.
9057486	9058848	I agree with that.
9058868	9071145	I actually did customer service for a very long time and I did... Well, at the time the department was called Service Quality where we... If they had a question, they could call us and ask us and we would tell them and make sure you repeat this.
9071665	9072026	But yeah...
9073107	9074528	Everyone is supposed to be on the same page.
9074728	9078310	Don't get me wrong, I'm glad Spazinator got what he wanted.
9078370	9081172	He just should have gotten it the first time.
9081292	9088536	If we can learn anything from this phone call, if you are at Sony, there's some edumacation to be done amongst your reps.
9088756	9098442	This is also a prime example why every time you talk to someone in a call center, you write down their name, you write down the date and the time that you spoke with them, and you keep a track of what you talked about.
9098622	9099743	They have to keep notes too.
9100023	9101303	Anyway, I know Spaz... I'm sorry.
9101463	9101944	No, that's okay.
9102184	9102844	No, it's important.
9102864	9104364	But Spazinator's dying to jump in here again.
9104404	9104985	Sorry, Spaz.
9106385	9109806	Yeah, I was going to say, granted, I never worked at a call center before.
9109826	9114988	The closest thing to that is working at a grocery store at the front desk.
9115628	9122350	But I basically talked about the initial response I got to, like, pre-apps.
9122410	9124211	I don't want to interrupt that.
9124231	9125051	I usually spoke to...
9126226	9145210	having an off day, you know, every deal with, you know, asshole customers, you know, they weren't quite as friendly as I was, or maybe possibly, you know, the rep possibly having some kind of bad information or getting your information mixed up somehow.
9145891	9155713	But ultimately, regardless of, you know, what the case may be, you know, ultimately I got my stuff back, which is the key thing there, so
9156688	9175086	You know, if, God forbid, I kept getting the same, you know, response time and time again, then I would have, you know, escalated the call to a supervisor like you three had suggested the first time this kind of thing happened.
9175747	9180011	Luckily, it didn't come to that, but, you know, God forbid it.
9180971	9194323	No, I was just going to say yay Sony for getting it right, but it is a bummer that it did take you a little bit of a run around to do it, but they made it right and we should recognize that at least it wasn't the doom and gloom we thought it was going to be.
9194644	9201470	But Spazinator, I've got to wrap up because we've got to see if we can fit in one or two more calls, but do you have anything else or a footnote to this or anything else you want to share with the listeners?
9203499	9213056	You know, nothing comes to mind, but I'll keep you guys posted on Twitter if there's anything that comes up or if I think anything early during the week.
9213617	9213877	All right.
9214037	9214558	Sounds good, buddy.
9216075	9217516	Alright, good luck with everything.
9217636	9218057	Take care, buddy.
9242927	9243247	I don't know.
9243587	9243888	I don't know.
9244168	9246989	I'm kind of torn because like, you know, I've bought things online.
9247049	9250691	I've done the digital distribution thing, but I've kind of taken a lot of that for granted.
9250731	9250991	Maybe.
9251171	9251412	All right.
9251652	9253653	Just buy TV episodes sometimes online.
9253673	9255214	Like if I'm behind on Supernatural.
9255234	9258615	That's why I like Netflix because Netflix, you know, you're not really buying anything.
9258655	9259336	You just kind of rent it.
9259656	9259836	All right.
9259856	9262117	Anyhow, let's do at least one more call here and then we're going to be on our way out.
9262177	9263078	Hey, you're on Orange Haunts Radio.
9263098	9263378	Who's this?
9264574	9280645	Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft Hey, Actdeft, I'm glad to see you weren't shaken too bad by the earthquake that happened last week, right before the show Yeah, we were shaken, but not stirred Not stirred, alright, well said What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9282220	9292623	I just wanted to add about the Twitter topic I sent earlier about the Mexican game being developed and brought over by Konami.
9294103	9301845	I just wanted to add that it's being distributed here in Mexico but it's being distributed by another company.
9302395	9311067	Okay, well that's good to know, because I think earlier I had said, oh ha ha, it's not coming out of Mexico, even though it's a Mexican game, but that's just, Konami's not putting it out there, someone else is.
9311127	9311768	Okay, that makes sense.
9312406	9316309	Yeah, it's actually made by Colombian and Mexican developers.
9316969	9324354	It's being published, I think, by... Well, developed by... Sorry.
9325575	9332239	The main development is being held here in Mexico, though Colombia is helping also over their studios.
9333060	9341866	I don't remember the name of the development company, but it's just starting right now to develop games, and I really hope that
9343227	9353015	This game at least develops or brings a market over Mexico because it's a very small market and it's starting right now.
9353675	9364764	I was going to say, I can't say, and maybe you can correct me here, but I can't say I can think of any big games or even medium-sized games that we can say this game was developed in Mexico by a Mexican developer.
9364964	9367428	Company or Columbia or any of these other places.
9368009	9373759	This seems to be like the first game we're really at least that I'm aware of that is developed like that.
9374844	9385853	Yeah, there's not really a market for Xbox 360 or PS3 games, maybe even Wii games that are developed at least this large.
9386154	9400006	There may be cell phone games that are being developed here and are made by companies like Gameloft and other companies, but made for a console, it's pretty much the first.
9400626	9401947	Do you see PS2 development?
9401967	9413018	Because my thought would be that a lot of these countries that they're not really being supported with the 360 and PS3, it seems that maybe the PS2 is still big there.
9427110	9431694	Actually, the PS2 isn't that big right now.
9432074	9434957	It's maybe the PS3 or the 360 maybe.
9435797	9436518	Okay, okay.
9436798	9449388	Maybe on other places like Brazil, and especially because of their import and taxes over there, the PS2 is starting to gain momentum there.
9449428	9450328	But here...
9451389	9459454	Even though the games, and I have talked about this before, the games are pretty expensive, but at least we're on the same market as America.
9461495	9465738	You mentioned Brazil, and the first thing I thought of is, I thought the Master System was still big in Brazil.
9465758	9467419	Yeah, it's still big.
9467579	9468580	It's like, whoa.
9469140	9471261	Well, they also have the re-releases.
9471282	9474824	Didn't we have a story about the Genesis repackaging that was coming out in Brazil?
9475504	9478566	There's some interesting things going on with old school games in Latin America.
9478606	9482808	Yeah, if I recall correctly, it's called the Bebo.
9483109	9483549	Oh, that's right.
9484810	9490393	It was brought over here in Mexico, though it wasn't as big as in Brazil.
9490813	9491234	Interesting.
9492176	9494497	I totally love Mexican wrestling I totally love Mexican wrestling
9519853	9520853	All right, well, we'll see.
9520913	9521753	We'll hope it does well.
9521793	9528115	At least, if nothing else, help the development market down there and get some more games out of there of some ideas.
9528775	9530876	Anything else you want to share with the listeners real quick tonight, Actdeft?
9531836	9536157	Well, only that we're okay over here in Mexicali.
9537397	9540958	Even though it was a pretty big quake, there was only pretty much...
9542830	9563625	The structural damages, there were only two lives lost and only a couple hundred of injuries, but other than that, we're pretty fine over here, though there are people that are needed of services and maybe camping tents and all that stuff, but
9566586	9568787	Other than that, we're pretty good.
9569007	9575552	Hopefully, at least here in America, the folks want to donate to the relief efforts.
9575592	9577413	I'm sure the Red Cross has something set up.
9577433	9581756	They always do for the cases like this, so definitely folks should look into that.
9581776	9584998	I'm glad to hear that for the most part, everything's okay.
9585098	9593224	It's sad that even one life was lost, but it sounds like it could have been a lot worse based on how bad the quake itself was.
9593744	9599275	So I'm glad to hear that at least you and everyone you care about are okay.
9600537	9600798	All right.
9601299	9603242	Well, Actdeft, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
9603282	9604284	But thanks so much for the call, okay?
9604986	9605326	Thank you.
9605446	9605687	All right.
9605727	9606228	Take care, my friend.
9607668	9609550	Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's calls.
9609590	9611171	And sorry for those folks that didn't get through.
9611531	9618938	It was ringing pretty good tonight because we actually had a lot of people that were trying to get in tonight because of last week.
9618978	9622801	But yeah, we got to wrap it up, you guys.
9623642	9624883	I'm starting a new job tomorrow.
9624923	9625964	I can't be here all night.
9626905	9628686	DarkSakura wants to go to bed eventually.
9629267	9632350	Matt might want to go back to KFC and ask for a double down with no sauce.
9633443	9633823	We'll see.
9634764	9636364	I'm kind of hungry because I didn't eat anything.
9637025	9638065	I offered to make ribs.
9638665	9639426	You can have cake.
9639446	9640146	I don't need ribs.
9640186	9643047	I'm going to have healthy special case cereal when I go home.
9643448	9643748	All right.
9644208	9649490	Anyhow, we got to wrap up, you guys, and get on out of here so we can... Ooh, our baked potato.
9649510	9650251	I'm going to have baked potato.
9650271	9650551	It's good.
9651091	9651471	It's good.
9651951	9652332	All right.
9652792	9653752	We got a... Uh-oh.
9653952	9654493	Uh-oh.
9654653	9656754	We have a stream down error.
9656814	9658034	Winamp has crashed.
9658895	9659895	God damn it.
9659995	9660275	All right.
9660315	9660675	That's okay.
9660695	9661876	We're going to just keep going here.
9662671	9663752	At least it's at the end of the show.
9664692	9665773	Yeah, at least it's at the end of the show.
9665853	9666533	Hold on, guys.
9666654	9667014	Dang it.
9669395	9669896	Poopy!
9670336	9674379	Alright, we're still recording for podcast, so can someone fill a little time here while I get us recorded?
9674399	9676820	I'm actually trying to find something to send you for Cage Match.
9677280	9677781	Okay, that's fine.
9677801	9682464	I have the same problem, but then I found something.
9683243	9685364	Well, I was gonna... Who was the winning song last time?
9685384	9685864	I don't even remember.
9685884	9687265	That would be, I think you, Rob.
9687325	9689005	You were... Was I with the Goldfrapp song?
9689025	9689445	It wasn't me.
9689505	9690846	Yeah, you were with the Goldfrapp song.
9690926	9691606	Okay, that's fine.
9691626	9693347	So I was gonna do like a throwaway.
9693567	9694367	Okay, there we go.
9694407	9695608	So we're still going.
9695788	9697789	Now we're back up and it's streaming on all games again.
9697809	9698589	I don't know what happened.
9698629	9699129	So, okay.
9699609	9700970	Now we can actually wrap up the show.
9701110	9702390	Winamp froze, you guys.
9702530	9703551	I don't know why it does that.
9704332	9704993	It's irritating.
9705013	9705794	Because it's Winamp.
9705974	9706375	I guess.
9706435	9708197	I mean, it might need to upgrade the version or something.
9708257	9710020	They always bug me with that.
9710160	9711482	You need to upgrade your version.
9711562	9713425	We'll have to run some tests before the next show.
9713485	9713845	I don't know.
9713885	9717971	But that's weird because just closing Skype shouldn't bork Winamp like that.
9718011	9718652	I don't know what happened.
9719393	9720514	All right, well, it is what it is.
9721014	9725336	Anyhow, we're still going to wrap up and be on out of here for the night.
9725717	9726897	Thanks so much for our Skype callers.
9727217	9730579	Thank you guys for listening to our show and supporting our independent radio.
9731159	9733881	I've got to get last-minute stories, though, before I give my whole spiel here.
9733901	9736662	It looks like Matt has a million tabs open on Firefox over there.
9736682	9737263	Yes, I do.
9737483	9739464	It's a million instances of the unicorn game.
9740484	9743446	DarkSakura, do you have any last-minute stories real quick before we go?
9745023	9745643	I just want to check.
9745783	9747544	All right, Loki then.
9747924	9762387	Okay, so Dark Void Zero, that wonderful 2D version of, or 8-bit 2D version of the game Dark Zero that hit the DSiWare is now going to be hitting the iPhone and PC actually tomorrow.
9762487	9763728	So that's pretty awesome.
9764148	9767249	And it'll cost you $2.99 on the iPhone, $5 on PC.
9767629	9768209	So that's not bad.
9768289	9770609	I actually may purchase that for my arcade cabinet.
9770790	9772150	I think that would fit in just nicely.
9774451	9776453	and a game that I was playing earlier this week.
9778214	9779355	I always have trouble pronouncing this.
9779975	9783678	Escaluda 2 will be hitting the iPhone as well.
9784178	9790363	Also, actually it should have already hit the iPhone because that would have been on the 10th.
9790743	9791583	That's awesome.
9792364	9799229	My friend linked a Japanese video of that in and I was actually already looking for it but I don't know that
9799824	9801565	I don't know how well I controlled it on the iPhone.
9801925	9804326	It looked pretty responsive on that video.
9804866	9806386	So I'm totally thinking about getting it.
9807767	9808167	Very cool.
9809908	9810548	Let's see here.
9811208	9817651	And then there's some interesting tie-ins apparently with Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.
9818591	9820612	They're going to have two different games tied in with it.
9820712	9825453	First one, Monster Hunter is actually going to be tied in with it as well.
9825794	9826954	Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G is
9829875	9837661	I guess there's going to be content from that game that's going to be able to work with Peace Walker, which is weird.
9838602	9850872	Apparently the little cat-like characters, the felines that appear in the Monster Hunter series are going to appear in the Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker game as well.
9851453	9852894	So that's interesting.
9853774	9875073	and then another weird one that's a crossover apparently you will also be able to link up Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker with Front Mission Evolved on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 players will be able to exchange parts acquired from Peace Walker bosses in Front Mission Evolved
9875885	9877286	How the hell does that work?
9877807	9878887	But that's interesting.
9880729	9883511	And you can use them for your mechs that you build in that game.
9883811	9886453	Talk about cross-company promotions there.
9886493	9888275	That's kind of neat, actually.
9889295	9891417	I actually want to check out that new Peace Walker game.
9891757	9893078	Or Front Mission.
9894239	9896781	And then, Professor Layton is actually coming over here.
9896821	9898062	It's getting a western release.
9898182	9899363	The movie, that is.
9900544	9902125	Developed by Level 5.
9902166	9902386	And...
9905217	9906619	Dead or Alive Paradise
9925899	9933563	People have found a way to swap out the textures in the game and now we get wonderful nipple-less naked women.
9933843	9936644	I'm sure it wasn't very hard with a Dead or Alive game.
9936704	9939806	So yeah, that game is five bucks on iTunes and I'm buying it right now.
9941546	9942227	Espagaluda?
9942247	9943127	Yeah.
9943147	9943247	Fun.
9943287	9943487	Yes.
9943667	9945028	Good luck controlling it on the iPhone.
9946845	9948626	Just not my favorite gaming platform.
9949806	9955249	And then finally, there was a patent filed for Rumble in a DS.
9955389	9957109	I'm assuming it's going to be in the 3DS.
9957730	9958090	Oh, I'm sure.
9958130	9962371	Yeah, I think there's been rumblings of Rumble for quite some time.
9963072	9963272	Yeah.
9963792	9966193	And hopefully dual analog sticks would be nice.
9966213	9966913	It would be great.
9967934	9969594	Because everybody likes dual analog sticks.
9969815	9970675	Not going to hold my breath, though.
9971915	9974037	I got a couple things thrown at me here in chat.
9974477	9982661	SSJ100Matt reminded me that I don't think we ever mentioned the winner of USL Madness or the March Madness, if you will, that happens on Orange Launch Radio.
9982681	9986323	I think we were off the week it ended and then, of course, last week's show was just off.
9987103	9989284	Chrono Trigger won for the first time.
9989885	9992086	It was declared the greatest game of all time.
9992126	9992406	Timed.
9993760	9998383	I thoroughly disagree with your votes, but whatever.
9998543	10002346	I mean, it's not like Chrono Trigger's a bad game, but I guess it was destined to win one of these years.
10002906	10007589	I've just decided in these contests, people just vote the way I don't vote.
10008710	10011872	And I don't know if it's a ha-ha, let's make Rob mad or whatever, but whatever.
10012572	10016355	I can think of a lot of games, a lot of games worse than Chrono Trigger.
10017215	10021518	So, yay Chrono Trigger and yay everybody that participated and boo and poop on those that didn't.
10021658	10031950	And also, as TychoClaw points out, Microsoft has changed the increments of which you have to purchase Microsoft Points to more manageable numbers instead of some weird rounded off numbers.
10032470	10035514	It's actually 400 and 800 and 1,600 and 4,000.
10035834	10036295	Is it really?
10036495	10036695	Yes.
10037036	10038177	I'd heard that they were doing that.
10038457	10040019	So they got rid of 500, 1,000, all that all together?
10040059	10040239	Yeah, yeah.
10041741	10042341	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10058873	10084726	one of the things they're trying to do to I guess you could say either compete with Netflix or Gamefly or both they are doing their games by mail service it's going to cost an extra $7.99 plus tax on top of the standard I guess you could say monthly fees you'll be able to rent one game at a time and that's the total number of discs that you're allowed to have out on the plan so there you go if you don't check any games out during the one month period though you're not charged the money
10085126	10086628	Kind of interesting how that all works.
10087289	10089592	It's currently being tested in Cleveland, Ohio.
10090333	10091715	Because Cleveland rocks.
10092015	10093837	Cleveland rocks, Ohio.
10094899	10097362	I'm thinking actually, you say that, I think of Howard the Duck.
10098483	10100106	You live in Cleveland.
10101267	10101848	Drew Carey Show.
10102355	10104057	I don't watch that.
10104237	10105619	It was like 10 years ago.
10105779	10107080	I didn't watch that.
10107641	10109443	They even had a Rocky Horror themed episode.
10109523	10111025	I did see that.
10111045	10111926	I'll see.
10112607	10115410	Wait, then how did you not watch the show yet see that episode?
10115450	10116371	I saw the clip on YouTube.
10116451	10117032	Yeah, YouTube.
10117472	10118674	YouTube, it ruins everything.
10119234	10119515	All right.
10120256	10121517	Anyhow, I think we're done.
10121557	10121857	Is that it?
10122018	10123199	Do you know what your story is, Loki?
10123644	10125685	Yeah, all the ones I wanted to do.
10125805	10127665	Some guy beat some Asteroids record too.
10128946	10132127	Hey now, don't haze Tigerclaw in chat.
10132147	10133607	This isn't the Tigerclaw link show.
10133987	10134647	He does a good job.
10135087	10137148	Actdeft says Tigerclaw more efficient than Google.
10137168	10137568	Seriously.
10137688	10142129	And DanMufrogerReturns is apparently hopping up on DSiWare as well.
10143090	10143910	Cannot die.
10144090	10144951	I cannot die.
10145011	10154496	This is why I like doing a show with a live chat room because when I don't know the answer instead of sitting here looking like an idiot or making something up, I mean, I still look like an idiot, but I'll just go, hey, chat, what was the answer to that?
10154756	10155577	Somebody always knows.
10156257	10158818	And if it involves a link, Tiger Claw has it in five seconds.
10158998	10160019	If not, SSJ100 Matt.
10160239	10161460	It's like a little friendly competition.
10161740	10163741	We should have a total board.
10165692	10166192	or something.
10166732	10167372	Alright, anyhow.
10168032	10169233	Of course, thank you guys so much.
10169393	10171213	All the chatters that help make the show happen.
10171253	10173433	You guys really are the fourth guest on the show, always.
10174134	10175434	And of course, you guys for listening.
10175474	10178874	I know we have a lot of people on the podcast who just can't be here for whatever reason Sunday night.
10179174	10182775	So thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.
10183095	10185216	You guys are awesome and thanks so much.
10185276	10192917	You know, all we say, if you enjoy the show, just tell somebody you know about the show or leave a nice review on iTunes or some other podcast site.
10193157	10193297	Cake!
10216969	10218530	Loki, do you have a final thought for us tonight?
10218690	10224233	I'm hoping to finish Final Fantasy XIII soon, although I have a feeling I'm not going to be able to because I have to get all the achievements.
10225053	10227274	And I have lots of games to start playing.
10229215	10235358	My final thought is the website ffxivcore.com is making me foam at the mouth.
10237162	10238343	That's really what it boils down to.
10239163	10240844	Anyhow, thank you guys again.
10241024	10241725	Have a great week.
10241825	10246408	We will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio to do this all over again.
10247568	10249509	New stories and all that other stuff.
10250130	10252831	But the same old crap that you've come to love week to week.
10253692	10258355	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10260560	10262100	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
10262120	10264881	To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm PT.
10286207	10288169	or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.
