24000	27000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 362 of Orange Lounge Radio
37000	40000	The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice
40000	44000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts
44000	46000	The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
46000	49000	For a moment it sounded like you were using a porn voice
49000	50000	A porn voice?
50000	51000	Yeah, a porn voice
51000	53000	What was porn-tastic about my voice?
53000	56000	You were doing that little dip in your voice
56000	59000	I was doing that wacky morning DJ
59000	62000	Let's go to Techmaster Loki with a check on traffic
64000	66000	No traffic in the house
67000	71000	Okay, let's go to Techmaster Loki with a check on the food
71000	74000	What's the food look like in the OLR studio today?
74000	76000	Awful and in a bag
76000	82000	Okay, for those who weren't listening to the wonderful Bobby Blackwolf
82000	84000	who tapes before us here at All Games Radio
84000	87000	www.allgames.com where of course we tape live every week
87000	89000	6pm Pacific, etc.
89000	92000	We were doing our little call that Bobby always does to us at the end of the show
92000	96000	and we got the realization that Loki brought to the show with him tonight
96000	100000	KFC, but he usually brings chicken to the show
100000	101000	that's no surprise
101000	103000	but he didn't just bring any old KFC tonight
103000	105000	oh no, he brought a Double Down to the show with him
105000	107000	For those who don't know what a Double Down is
107000	109000	Loki, please quickly define
109000	111000	What is the Double Down from KFC?
111000	114000	It's a new sandwich from KFC that just launched today I think
114000	120000	and it's basically instead of having some sort of bread holding a sandwich together
120000	127000	there is chicken strips holding bacon, cheese, and cheese sauce together
127000	130000	and it's supposed to be incredibly unhealthy
130000	132000	so that's why I tried it
132000	133000	because it would be funny
133000	135000	because it's like, oh my god, that's gross
135000	137000	yes, when you have that heart attack, it's gonna be hilarious
137000	138000	it smelled awful
138000	141000	it actually wasn't bad, but here's the problem
141000	142000	the cheese sauce is just awful
142000	144000	that's why I am not eating that
144000	148000	not because it's so unhealthy and full of bacon and grease and stuff like that
148000	151000	it's because that cheese sauce tastes like some blended
151000	155000	rotten mayonnaise, ranch, and cheese whiz together
155000	157000	and it's just, it's awful
157000	160000	so, if you do get Double Down, don't get it with the cheese sauce
160000	162000	otherwise it'll probably be good without it
162000	166000	I mean, seriously, the strips themselves
166000	169000	it's all white meat and so it's healthy for you
169000	171000	no, just kidding, it's not healthy
171000	173000	you can get it grilled though
173000	176000	that's gonna really help with all the cheese on it
176000	179000	I think though that if you got it grilled
179000	182000	well, it actually would be perfect for anyone doing a low carb diet though
182000	186000	I guess, but honestly, if I want to eat healthy, quote unquote, at KFC
186000	189000	I would probably get like a two piece meal
189000	192000	grilled with like mashed potatoes, no gravy, or something
192000	195000	I know, I was just being funny
195000	197000	or I probably wouldn't go to KFC at all
197000	199000	I would probably just eat a fruit salad
199000	200000	I just was going to see if they had the Double Down
200000	202000	they did, so I got it, and
202000	205000	I was sorely disappointed with that cheese sauce
205000	208000	I figured, okay, it's just gonna be something that tastes like cheese
208000	210000	but it's like a melted consistency
210000	213000	but no, they had to spice it up with like ranch or something
213000	217000	it's just gross, and it's overpowering the entire
217000	220000	it smelled really bad, or whatever it is
220000	222000	I could smell it from over here
222000	225000	so that's so unfortunate because I had high hopes for that
225000	227000	but, oh well
227000	229000	I actually have a challenge for everybody
229000	230000	for next month
230000	231000	what's that?
231000	234000	no fast food for a month
234000	236000	good luck
236000	237000	I've been
237000	238000	no, I've done it before
238000	240000	that wasn't the first fast food I've had in two weeks, so
240000	242000	it's not dinner that I have a problem with
242000	244000	that's really easy, it's lunch at work
244000	247000	is really hard, especially when I only have had a three minute lunch
247000	249000	but I'm starting a new job this coming week
249000	250000	which is exciting
250000	251000	I will tell you
251000	252000	day job
252000	255000	my BFF Becky
255000	258000	we have three days out of the week
258000	261000	we walk during lunch, and we bring our own lunch
261000	263000	and I have this huge mungus thermos thing
263000	266000	but the dollar store, Rob, is selling those cubes
266000	268000	those frozen cube things
268000	272000	that you can put in a thermal container
272000	276000	but no, it was something I was actually wanting to do
276000	281000	is do the one month fast food free challenge
281000	282000	and then
282000	287000	for, you know, average how many times you want
287000	289000	would normally go out for fast food
289000	292000	and then put the money that you normally would have spent
292000	294000	on a happy meal or something aside
294000	296000	and donate it to charity at the end of the month
296000	297000	questions from chat
297000	299000	Zappi says, does Subway count as fast food?
299000	303000	Yeah, what defines fast food?
303000	304000	That's tricky
304000	306000	because you can't say anything without a drive-thru
306000	308000	because I've seen subways with drive-thrus
308000	310000	and subways with drive-thrus?
310000	312000	God, that would be annoying
312000	314000	Okay, I'll make a list
314000	317000	Basically, okay, if it's a sandwich
317000	322000	you know, if it looks unhealthy, it probably is fast food
322000	326000	I would say the types like McDonald's and Sonic
326000	327000	I love Sonic
327000	330000	It's something like, we're getting way off topic
330000	332000	If they serve hamburgers or tacos
332000	334000	Or maybe if fast food is okay
334000	336000	if you can keep it 10 grams of fat or less
336000	337000	I don't know
337000	340000	Because at Subway it's really easy to do 10 grams of fat or less
340000	342000	Okay, this is the thing
342000	345000	Almost any of these
345000	349000	I'm talking about just like the
349000	354000	the really highly processed food, you know what I mean?
354000	357000	I include KFC in this too
357000	360000	because their chicken is just a gene bait
360000	364000	But seriously
364000	368000	I'm giving it a start in May
368000	371000	because I know for a lot of people it's a habit to change
371000	375000	Let's try to tie it in with some type of Wii Fit or DDR
375000	376000	That's what I was thinking
376000	378000	If you rub the food on a piece of paper
378000	380000	and it turns transparent
380000	382000	then it's probably fast food
382000	383000	The food or the paper
383000	385000	We gotta get back to
385000	387000	Listeners, help give us ideas
387000	389000	and we'll formulate a contest
389000	391000	But seriously though, this is the first soda
391000	393000	and first fast food I've had in two weeks
393000	395000	I ate my first soda today
395000	397000	That's only because I wanted to try to double down
397000	401000	So technically I ate very few calories
401000	404000	because I only had like two bites of that in a soda
404000	407000	So I'm doing good still
407000	411000	So what grade would you give the KFC double down here?
411000	414000	I would give it probably a D
414000	418000	just because the cheese sauce
418000	419000	If it was at the cheese sauce
419000	422000	I would have probably given it like a B
422000	426000	The double down gets a D here on Orange Lounge Mornings
426000	428000	on KAllGames
428000	431000	It needs like American cheese melted on there
431000	433000	instead of the cheese sauce and it might be good
433000	437000	Once in a while we talk about video games here on the program at Orange Lounge Radio
437000	440000	Hey if you wanna pull up a chair and join us in our chatroom
440000	444000	Or what they need to have instead of the cheese sauce
444000	446000	their gravy that they have
446000	448000	That would be perfect
448000	451000	Okay enough, enough, no more food talk
451000	453000	Let's talk about games, dark sakura
453000	455000	Please tell me you've played a video game this week
455000	457000	Rock band
457000	461000	A fuck ton of rock band last night for my party
461000	464000	What was the best beer at your beer potluck out of curiosity?
464000	465000	What was the best one?
465000	467000	The one that I brought of course
467000	468000	I'm just kidding
468000	472000	You know what Rob, I've actually saved that chocolate beer for an occasion
472000	477000	And Dan's like, they bring you, what's this? Peach? What?
477000	478000	It's good
478000	482000	I like the black currant one but I've had tons of their different ones before
482000	484000	I haven't tried the peach yet but I love the black currant
484000	488000	But the Young's is gonna be
488000	492000	I'm going to be having one every night when I get back from school
492000	493000	Nice
493000	497000	That's gonna be my I'm not in school beer
497000	500000	There's still so much beer in my fridge really
500000	503000	I wasn't really gonna drink any
503000	505000	It's totally my fault but we went from food to beer
505000	507000	And just totally dodged the game
507000	513000	Oh yeah, by the way, rock band, beer!
513000	515000	Totally my fault, I enabled it
515000	522000	I had a Guinness, a couple of new castles, about three fat tires
522000	524000	Clearly she was playing tapper
524000	528000	Two Killian's Red
528000	533000	Heather brought the Sierra Nevada but I really don't like Sierra Nevada at all
533000	540000	And then I was gonna go, I actually picked up the four pack
540000	546000	I was like, I'm gonna have, can't drink any more beer!
546000	549000	I had no voice, my throat still hurts today
549000	551000	And there was rock band?
551000	553000	There was lots of rock band, all day, rock band
553000	557000	We stopped long enough for Dan to play outrun
557000	563000	And then him and one of my co-workers that showed up
563000	568000	Played, it was either him, no I think it was my friend Gary anyway
568000	571000	They were playing Bad Dudes
571000	574000	Awesome, oh like on the Wii?
574000	577000	No the Xbox, was it Bad Dudes or Double Dragon?
577000	580000	It's Double Dragon, it's on the Xbox, not Bad Dudes
580000	582000	I was like, are you a bad enough dude to eat some carrot cake?
582000	584000	Just the topic of Bad Dudes has come up on this show before
584000	587000	There is still a lot of cake left
587000	590000	If anybody wants cake, I have lots
590000	592000	Will you FedEx slices of cake to our listeners?
592000	594000	I'm talking about people in this house
594000	595000	What kind of cake?
595000	596000	Chocolate and carrot
596000	598000	The carrot cake is actually really good
598000	600000	Chocolate and carrot cake or chocolate and carrot cake?
600000	601000	Separate
601000	603000	Oh the chocolate and carrot cake would be kind of rad
603000	604000	You could smoosh it together
604000	606000	I don't like carrot cake
606000	608000	God damn it with the food!
608000	610000	Would you like a piece of chocolate?
610000	612000	No, I shouldn't, so I'm not going to
612000	614000	You should have some chocolate cake
614000	616000	Take it with you
616000	618000	Take it with you
618000	620000	I can't take it with me, Laura
620000	622000	I could build a house out of cake
622000	624000	That sounds like a fun project
624000	627000	Should I just pitch the show for the Food Network?
627000	629000	I mean, should we leave all games and be on a more appropriate network?
629000	632000	No, I have tons of game stuff I could talk about
632000	634000	I'm just waiting
634000	636000	Add three cakes
636000	639000	One of them is gluten free though, so I will be taking some to work
639000	641000	So cake mania, taproom
641000	643000	I'm going to get cake right now
643000	645000	Loki
645000	648000	Here I thought this week's show would be better than the train wreck that was last week
648000	653000	But clearly, clearly I was underestimating the ability of this program
653000	655000	Well, Loki, before you do your gaming week
655000	657000	I already spoiled it and sent it to the listeners last week
657000	659000	But congratulations for you and Nellie are in order
659000	661000	Yes, thank you, thank you
661000	664000	She is, ironically enough today
664000	667000	She is as pregnant as she was when she had the twins
667000	671000	So she is a little nervous, but less nervous today
671000	678000	But yes, she's about 21 weeks and four days, I believe?
678000	680000	Three days? 21 weeks and three days
680000	682000	Yeah, so
682000	684000	One boy, we know that
684000	688000	So everything's cool so far
688000	690000	Anyways, so games
690000	693000	So let me first start off with a story
693000	696000	Because this is really odd, but awesome at the same time
696000	700000	So Friday, you know, it
700000	702000	I think it was Friday, anyways
702000	707000	Friday, not this Friday, but last Friday
707000	710000	I get this mysterious package in the mail
710000	712000	I'm like, what the hell is this?
712000	715000	Was it something I ordered off eBay and completely forgot about?
715000	719000	Inside was an Xbox 360
719000	722000	Apparently we have a listener who is staying anonymous
722000	725000	In the Austin, Texas area
725000	730000	And has sent me a 360 that was already J-tagged
730000	733000	To replace the 360 that I had stolen
733000	735000	I don't know who we have in Austin, Texas
735000	736000	I don't know either
736000	738000	That's not far from where Travis Donovan is, but
738000	740000	He doesn't really like this show
740000	742000	No, no, I don't know
742000	745000	Whoever it was, they posted like a small little message
745000	748000	It was kind of in broken English, so I don't know if it's
748000	751000	I don't know, anyways
751000	754000	So long story short, I'm very thankful for that
754000	756000	And thankfully I do have
756000	758000	Wait, how did they get your address?
758000	759000	I don't know
759000	761000	Isn't that, doesn't that, wait, wait
761000	763000	Doesn't that strike you as slightly creepy?
763000	766000	Like, I don't know if I would actually be excited about the Xbox
766000	770000	I would more be wondering, how did a listener get my home address?
770000	772000	No, it was sent to my work, so
772000	775000	Oh, have you said where you work on this program before?
775000	776000	I might have at one point
776000	777000	Weird
777000	779000	Maybe Namco sent it, they know where you work
779000	785000	Yes, that makes perfect sense
785000	787000	We learned that a couple of years ago
787000	789000	Fun times
789000	793000	No, but anyways, I'm incredibly thankful for that
793000	796000	And, you know, I've been messing with it for
796000	799000	Well, this last, you know, week or so
799000	802000	Okay, but seriously, ask before you send us strange packages in the mail
802000	803000	It's always a nice thing to do
803000	805000	Exactly, and I mean, definitely, I would
805000	809000	You know, that was incredible, and I
809000	811000	No, I mean, it's a very nice gesture
811000	812000	Exactly
812000	814000	There is a small part of me where I'm like, oh, that's awesome
814000	817000	Like, that's 90%, no, I was even like 95% awesome
817000	821000	But 5%, like, how did they get your address?
821000	823000	I wasn't even thinking about that, honestly
823000	826000	I was like, woohoo, yeah!
826000	828000	No, but, no, it's been cool
828000	833000	So, I've been playing a lot of games, obviously
833000	838000	One more thought, could it have been the guy that we sicced the O.L. Army on?
838000	839000	Maybe just
839000	842000	In Austin, Texas? Would he, like, leave the state?
842000	844000	Maybe?
844000	846000	I don't know
846000	848000	Alright, just cheers
848000	849000	Alright
849000	852000	So anyways, so, games
852000	854000	What did I play this week?
854000	857000	I played, actually, some Japanese shooters
857000	863000	I was at Espegluda 2, actually played that quite a bit
863000	865000	Went through kind of the
865000	868000	I figured I'd start off at the easy mode on there
868000	870000	And it's pretty fun, it's a little different
870000	874000	I haven't really played a lot of the Japanese shmup games
874000	879000	But, it's pretty fun, a lot of dodging bullets and whatnot
879000	883000	So, definitely worth checking out if they ever bring it over here
883000	887000	Tried a little bit of Otomedius Gorgeous
887000	890000	That game is a little weirder than I thought
890000	894000	But it definitely has that whole Gradius vibe to it, of course
894000	896000	But that's pretty fun
896000	899000	And, played through more Final Fantasy XIII
899000	903000	I'm now, well, I don't know if I should say Warmack
903000	905000	Because that's kind of a spoiler, I guess
905000	909000	But, I'm to the point in the game where it kind of opens up, like, you know
909000	911000	How many hours in are you?
911000	914000	16, but then again I'm cheating, remember, so
914000	915000	Oh, right, that's right
915000	919000	So, I'm on chapter 11, I believe
919000	920000	Okay, okay
920000	925000	And it opens up kind of like an overworld and stuff
925000	931000	And it's almost like in Wind Waker where you go, spoiler
931000	934000	You go under the ocean or whatever and you see Hyrule
934000	937000	And you're like, why couldn't the whole game have been like this, you know?
937000	939000	Why couldn't they have just done this instead?
939000	945000	Well, that's almost, to me, what this part of the game is for Final Fantasy XIII
945000	948000	For the people that are complaining, why isn't there an overworld in this?
948000	952000	You know, why couldn't they have done the whole game like this?
952000	956000	Because it's basically kind of like an overworld situation
956000	960000	But, at the same time there's all these side quests and stuff you can do
960000	965000	Which are kind of annoying, but they're relatively easy for me, I guess
965000	971000	And the narrative's kind of moving along a little bit, but I still don't know entirely what's going on
971000	973000	But I think I'm at the end, or close to the end
973000	978000	I just want to interject real quick, because the chatters were commenting on Loki's mic being all screwed up tonight
978000	980000	That's actually really my bad
980000	984000	I took Loki's mic to PAX East with me for the show that we did out there
984000	989000	And unfortunately he has our old spare mic, which is just an old mic we had lying around
989000	993000	And the audio settings were left on, every mic is different
993000	996000	And so, long story short, I've been having to adjust on the fly
996000	1001000	So if Loki's audio is going up and down and changing around, that's me playing on the mixing board
1001000	1004000	So it should be all better now though, I think I found where it needs to be
1004000	1006000	Sorry, listeners, sorry, Loki
1006000	1011000	And then, so yeah, it's alright, it's kind of neat
1011000	1019000	And unfortunately those characters didn't seem like they were too much lesbians at this point in the game
1019000	1025000	Although there was an embrace part of the game which I was like, are they gonna kiss?
1025000	1031000	I wasn't trying to go there, I was trying to keep quiet on the spoilery stuff
1031000	1035000	But I do think there are lesbians in Final Fantasy 13
1035000	1040000	Yeah, they're close, we don't know how close, but they're close
1040000	1043000	I think they're very close, just saying
1043000	1047000	Cougar kitten thing going on there
1047000	1049000	There is definitely a cougar kitten thing going on
1049000	1051000	Anyway, no more spoilers
1051000	1054000	Alright, anyways, so yeah, it's pretty awesome
1054000	1062000	And then, and there's a loud commercial for Lysol power toilet cleaner
1062000	1067000	Anyways, I believe that was it as far as games though
1067000	1073000	Granted, you probably guys know what JTAG consoles are for
1073000	1077000	Nothing legit, Bobby would not approve, of course
1077000	1084000	Let me just say, there's a lot of Rock Band load content out there
1084000	1090000	Well, I'm hoping, Loki, you're only using it to do the import games and not the shady stuff
1090000	1093000	Import games are okay, I think
1093000	1096000	I say import games, they don't bother to release, they're a fair game
1096000	1097000	That's my stance on piracy
1097000	1104000	The only games I've ever really, really liked, just totally been hardcore pirating into would be the import stuff
1104000	1106000	Especially back in the PS1 days
1106000	1111000	Because I'm not gonna pay to import games if the publisher doesn't believe in the game here
1111000	1116000	I did install a 640GB hard drive though in the shell of an old 360 case
1116000	1120000	So now I can use that because JTAG consoles allow you to do that
1120000	1124000	But it's awesome, I like playing games from other regions
1124000	1129000	Alright, if that's it for your gaming week, then I'll talk quickly about my gaming week
1129000	1135000	I actually didn't play a lot of new games, just kind of a potpourri, a lot, a lot of old games this week
1135000	1137000	Especially on Xbox Live Arcade
1137000	1140000	I did play a little more Game Room, I guess I could say that, just a little more
1140000	1145000	I haven't really been working on the Yars Revenge duel with Bobby
1145000	1150000	Because actually, Bradley, Arkadian42, who hasn't been on this show in quite some time
1150000	1151000	But he was here last night
1151000	1154000	I randomly saw him yesterday, yes, he has smoked both Bobby and I
1154000	1156000	I don't think Bobby can see that
1156000	1160000	But like, now I don't just have to beat Bobby, I have to beat Bradley
1160000	1162000	And that's even, that's 130,000 points
1162000	1164000	I actually messed a little bit with Game Room
1164000	1169000	And I noticed I got a lot of achievements really quick by just doing stuff
1169000	1172000	You can get about 100 points doing next to nothing
1172000	1175000	But you do have to actually play games to get more
1175000	1177000	But I bought Crystal Castles
1177000	1181000	Because I had a friend over who really wanted to see Crystal
1181000	1183000	Because they remembered it from the 80s and they really wanted to play it
1183000	1185000	And I was like, okay, you know, I liked Crystal Castles enough
1185000	1187000	Where I'll spend the money to get it
1187000	1188000	You know, it's like renting a movie
1188000	1191000	You know, five bucks is about how much it costs to rent a movie
1191000	1194000	Because I buy all my games for both, computer and 360
1194000	1199000	And when we got it, I realized the control sucks
1199000	1201000	Like really sucks for that game
1201000	1206000	Because the controller analog stick is no substitute for a trackball
1206000	1208000	Not at all
1208000	1210000	Tried to play it and then I thought, oh, it'll be okay
1210000	1212000	Because I have it on the computer
1212000	1213000	And I can use the mouse
1213000	1216000	And the mouse makes a, because a mouse is basically an inverted trackball
1216000	1218000	So it makes a, it's not a perfect substitute
1218000	1220000	But it's probably the best one there is
1220000	1222000	So I figured, okay, I'll play Crystal Castles with the mouse
1222000	1224000	Nope, can't use the mouse
1226000	1227000	I remember I, irritating
1227000	1229000	I used to play that on the Apple II
1229000	1231000	Way back in the day
1231000	1233000	And a mouse worked okay then
1233000	1236000	But I guess if they don't support it at all then
1236000	1237000	I don't support it at all
1237000	1238000	It's awful
1238000	1240000	Unless, I could have missed something
1240000	1242000	But, you know, what I did is I unplugged my 360 controller
1242000	1244000	And it defaulted to keyboard controls
1244000	1248000	And I couldn't find an option in there to switch it to the mouse to control
1248000	1251000	Which makes sense because you don't have a mouse on 360
1251000	1253000	And the game is kind of made for both
1253000	1254000	And it's very obvious
1254000	1257000	But it's just, you know, it's just these little things
1257000	1259000	That are just killing Game Room for me
1259000	1261000	Like there's so much potential with Game Room
1261000	1265000	And there's so much that I really want to like about Game Room
1265000	1268000	But there's these glaring things that just irritate me
1268000	1271000	Like, oh, why didn't you find this sooner you dummy
1271000	1273000	You know, just in the servers
1273000	1276000	And, you know, just some of the things with it
1276000	1278000	Um, let's see, look at our chat room
1278000	1279000	chat.orangelandrater.com
1279000	1282000	Brad says, sucks, does not even begin to describe it
1282000	1285000	Our buddy from Pod Culture, Brad there
1285000	1287000	Ah, alright, anyhow
1287000	1290000	Um, chat.orangelandrater.com
1290000	1291000	If you want to join us
1291000	1292000	So, yeah, a little bit of Game Room
1292000	1294000	And just some random other games too
1294000	1297000	On the arcade, you know, like playing
1297000	1299000	Street Fighter and Puzzle Fighter
1299000	1302000	And Mega Man 9 and just random stuff
1302000	1303000	All throughout the week
1303000	1304000	And wow, lots of wow
1304000	1305000	I rolled a Death Knight
1305000	1308000	My Death Knight's already level, just about level 61
1308000	1311000	PVP is super fun with a Death Knight
1311000	1312000	I just want to say
1312000	1313000	It's a lot of fun
1313000	1317000	So, alright, um, let's get into some housekeeping tonight
1317000	1319000	Of which I don't have an awful lot
1319000	1321000	Um, just, you know, uh, join our Facebook

1335000	1339000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at AllGames.com
1339000	1340000	That's really all I have for housekeeping
1340000	1342000	We don't have any shows off that I'm aware of coming up
1342000	1343000	Or anything else
1343000	1345000	So, we're just gonna keep right on truckin'
1345000	1347000	With some gaming news
1347000	1349000	Quite a bit of gaming news coming out of Konami
1349000	1350000	They had a big press
1350000	1353000	They had their, um, uh, Gamers' Night this week, right?
1353000	1354000	Really, I didn't know
1354000	1355000	We didn't get invited
1355000	1357000	Well, you know, but it's in L.A. now
1357000	1358000	I wouldn't have been able to go anyway if we did
1358000	1359000	Oh, that's true, that's right
1359000	1360000	You know, and
1360000	1361000	I always forget that they're not
1361000	1362000	Yeah, they're not in the Bay anymore
1362000	1364000	So, yeah, I wouldn't have been able to go anyway
1364000	1365000	I don't know
1365000	1367000	It's kind of one of those things where, especially if they're
1367000	1369000	You know, one thing we don't have news on is, is DDR
1369000	1372000	And, you know, I realize that's kind of how we started
1372000	1374000	Although, I guess
1374000	1376000	I don't know if I should say this, but
1376000	1378000	I don't know if I really should say this on the air
1378000	1381000	There's a very good chance we're gonna have an interview with them at E3 this year
1381000	1382000	Very good chance
1382000	1384000	I'm trying to pull some strings
1384000	1387000	So, uh, gonna be a, gonna be a fun E3
1387000	1388000	Alright
1388000	1389000	You're going to E3?
1389000	1390000	Yep
1390000	1391000	Alright, cool
1391000	1392000	Good times
1392000	1393000	Alright, anyhow, sorry
1393000	1395000	You already could tell some news from, uh
1395000	1397000	I thought you, are you, well, you can't go
1397000	1400000	Now, I wondered why you were so, like, nope, can't go
1400000	1402000	Nope, there's no way I'm going to E3 this year
1402000	1404000	And I was like, well, what, you're not even gonna ask? What the hell?
1404000	1406000	And now that we know that the wife is pregnant
1406000	1408000	Now, that makes sense
1408000	1410000	Cause isn't that right around the due date too?
1410000	1411000	No, August
1411000	1412000	Oh no, okay
1412000	1413000	So
1413000	1416000	Well, you said a long time ago, Jamie, you couldn't go
1416000	1418000	You said school or something
1418000	1419000	I'm trying to graduate
1419000	1420000	Yeah
1420000	1421000	So
1421000	1423000	I'll go
1423000	1426000	I suppose if no one else wants to go, I'll go to E3
1426000	1428000	And, you know, do whatever
1428000	1430000	Alright, anyhow
1430000	1431000	Konami, news
1431000	1432000	Oh, I forgot to ask you
1432000	1433000	What?
1433000	1436000	Because you went to PAX East, did they have any of the PlayStation Move stuff there?
1436000	1438000	Did you get the, hm, would you play it?
1438000	1440000	No, there was no move at PAX East
1440000	1441000	Yeah, they sucked
1441000	1442000	Well, you'll have to listen to last week's show, no, I'm kidding
1442000	1444000	I don't want to listen to last week's show
1444000	1445000	Yeah, it was pretty bad
1445000	1447000	Uh, hey, this week isn't turning out much better
1447000	1449000	Uh, APB was there
1449000	1451000	I think that's the one you would have liked the most
1451000	1453000	Yeah, they had a playable, they had playable ABP
1453000	1454000	I definitely thought of you
1454000	1457000	I do have video I shot, I can show you at some point
1457000	1458000	Awesome
1458000	1461000	That was the one that, well, actually, you would have really enjoyed the line
1461000	1463000	The Crackdown 2 was out on the floor
1463000	1464000	Yep
1464000	1467000	And, uh, I don't know what else you really liked
1467000	1469000	But it just seemed there was a lot of Loki games there
1469000	1471000	Yeah, I wanted to check out Crackdown 2
1471000	1473000	But I'll wait for that
1473000	1477000	I'm actually going back to Crackdown 1 to try to finish, finish that
1477000	1481000	I mean, I finished it, but I have to find, like, ten orbs that I'm missing
1481000	1485000	Um, and, just, I'm trying to go back to some of the older stuff
1485000	1489000	But, really, I don't know, Crackdown 2 is going to be awesome
1489000	1491000	I'm so sad that they pushed it to July
1491000	1493000	It's supposed to be coming out in May
1493000	1494000	Alright, oh well
1494000	1496000	Anyway, we had Konami news at some point, right?
1496000	1497000	Yes
1497000	1498000	Alright
1498000	1499000	So let's talk about Konami
1499000	1502000	Uh, Konami is taking a page out of Capcom's book
1502000	1508000	Um, re-issuing one of their games and kind of giving it the whole HD treatment
1508000	1513000	Uh, Russian Attack Ex-Patriot is a brand new Russian Attack game
1513000	1516000	Kind of looks very similar to Bionic Commando Rearmed
1516000	1521000	And they're doing the whole 2.5D, um, kind of update to it
1521000	1526000	And it will be available on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network
1526000	1529000	And, of course, um, the game looks pretty cool
1529000	1534000	Except, honestly, I don't believe I liked Russian Attack very much
1534000	1536000	Maybe just because it was very difficult
1536000	1538000	It can't be a souped up version of the old arcade game
1538000	1540000	The old arcade game was too straightforward
1540000	1542000	Like, it was a very old school 80s game
1542000	1544000	Well, this is supposed to be pretty linear too, I think
1544000	1545000	Interesting
1545000	1547000	Well, you know, the little video I saw
1547000	1550000	It's ironic that you compare it to Capcom and Bionic Commando
1550000	1552000	Because that's the first thing I thought of
1552000	1553000	And the look of it
1553000	1554000	Just the color palette and stuff reminds me
1554000	1556000	Just the look of it really looks like Bionic Commando Rearmed
1556000	1560000	But, sort of, to be fair, it looked a little bit like Shadow Complex as well
1560000	1563000	Shadow Complex kind of has that same sort of style to it
1563000	1564000	It's not bad
1564000	1565000	With the 2D, 3D look
1565000	1566000	Oh, yeah, it looked cool
1566000	1568000	The Russian Attack arcade game's okay
1568000	1570000	But here's the thing
1570000	1575000	Bionic Commando Rearmed, I think, really cashed in
1575000	1576000	I don't know why we keep comparing it to this
1576000	1578000	But it's just why, what I think when I see it
1578000	1579000	Because they did it well
1579000	1581000	They were the best example of doing this
1581000	1584000	Yes, and, but Bionic Commando had a lot of nostalgia with it
1584000	1586000	Like, I think more people remember Bionic Commando
1586000	1589000	Than remember Russian Attack
1589000	1592000	Like, quick poll of our chat room
1592000	1596000	How many of you remember Russian Attack?
1596000	1598000	Like, not just, like, name, triggers
1598000	1599000	Oh, yeah, I think that was a game somewhere
1599000	1601000	But, like, actually, like, can think of in your mind
1601000	1602000	How the game plays
1602000	1604000	Like, just, you know
1604000	1606000	Especially versus Bionic Commando
1606000	1607000	Just a quick poll of chat
1607000	1608000	Chirp, chirp
1608000	1610000	Do you remember Russian Attack, Jamie?
1610000	1612000	I remember looking at it
1612000	1614000	And she's got a freaking vault of games
1614000	1615000	I don't think we have Russian Attack
1615000	1617000	She has a freaking game that came with a dish
1617000	1618000	I mean, that's
1618000	1620000	That's true, I do have a game that came with a dish
1620000	1622000	And she doesn't remember Russian Attack very well
1622000	1624000	I mean, that ought to tell you something right there
1624000	1625000	So
1625000	1626000	And Dan's not here for us to
1626000	1628000	No, Zappy, not Russian
1628000	1630000	It's Rush in Attack
1630000	1632000	Oh, yeah, I do remember that
1632000	1633000	Rush and Attack
1633000	1635000	Yes, but with an N
1635000	1636000	No, wasn't there an arcade one?
1636000	1637000	Yes
1637000	1639000	Yeah, we had it at my arcade
1639000	1641000	Okay, oh, well, there you go
1641000	1644000	No, there was another game, though, that was
1644000	1646000	I was thinking, never mind
1646000	1647000	Yeah, we had it at my arcade
1647000	1648000	Zappy in our chat room
1648000	1650000	Russian Attack would be like Karnov
1650000	1651000	That's Russian Attack
1651000	1656000	It had that kind of oblique, all bold logo to it as well
1656000	1657000	Yeah
1657000	1658000	Yeah, I remember it
1658000	1660000	Let's see, Tigerclaw says
1660000	1663000	Rush in Attack was a game I fondly remember
1663000	1665000	I remember going to a local grocery store
1665000	1667000	And putting a ton of quarters trying to beat the game
1667000	1670000	It was hard, but then when I had fun playing it on the NES
1670000	1674000	Let's see, Tigerclaw also jumps in that
1674000	1676000	Russian Attack on the NES had two player co-op
1676000	1677000	I mean, Satsuma said
1677000	1680000	I remember playing an XBLA demo of Russian Attack
1680000	1681000	Does that count?
1681000	1683000	And yeah, that was one of those Konami games
1683000	1686000	They dumped a bunch of them on Xbox Live
1686000	1687000	When the arcade was first out
1687000	1688000	They were like a dime a dozen
1688000	1690000	I mean, some of them were notable
1690000	1692000	You know Frogger, the old arcade game
1692000	1694000	It was one of the first ones, so it was still pretty cool
1694000	1696000	JIRUS, like I really like that one
1696000	1698000	Time Pilot, and there was a lot of obscure
1698000	1699000	Scramble
1699000	1705000	They need a 2.5D HD remake of Contra
1705000	1707000	They had a Contra on it
1707000	1708000	But it was just the arcade version
1708000	1711000	Well, yeah, but they had a sequel they did for WiiWare
1711000	1713000	I mean, port that over
1713000	1716000	I'll tell you one title, Konami
1716000	1718000	That will not work with this HD remix thing
1718000	1720000	And I think you've already done it anyways
1720000	1722000	Frogger, please god, no more Frogger games
1722000	1723000	Ever, no more
1723000	1725000	I'm pretty sure it's already been done
1725000	1728000	There was a Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade
1728000	1729000	But the funny thing about it
1729000	1731000	It's actually like the third or fourth Frogger 2
1731000	1733000	That's come out
1733000	1735000	Cause like back in the Commodore 64 days
1735000	1737000	There was Frogger 2 three deep
1737000	1739000	There was Frogger 2 on the Playstation
1739000	1741000	And then there was this Frogger Swampies thing
1741000	1742000	I don't know, whatever
1742000	1744000	Ooh, Dark Tetsuya has a good point
1744000	1746000	It used to be called Green Beret in Japan
1746000	1748000	If I recall correctly, I think he's right
1748000	1750000	I think that game was called something completely different overseas
1750000	1752000	I think it was called Green Beret, that's right
1752000	1754000	I remember the game on Xbox Live
1754000	1756000	But like before that, not really
1756000	1758000	You know, so again
1758000	1760000	I just, you know
1760000	1762000	If the nostalgia is what they're trying to cash in on
1762000	1764000	I don't think there's a lot of nostalgia there
1764000	1767000	So I sort of hope the game can stand on its own two feet
1767000	1769000	I mean, the game can rise above the nostalgia
1769000	1771000	If it's a great game, it won't matter
1771000	1774000	That it ties into this obscure ass 80s game nobody remembers, right?
1774000	1775000	Exactly
1775000	1777000	So we'll see, I guess
1777000	1779000	I imagine there'll be more of this
1779000	1781000	At E3?
1781000	1782000	Probably
1782000	1785000	Robert M says, Rush and Attack was on the Game Boy Advance compilation, wasn't it?
1785000	1788000	I am like 95% positive, yes it was
1788000	1790000	It was on that Game Boy Advance compilation
1790000	1793000	That had all the old school Konami games from the 80s
1793000	1796000	I don't know if they called it that
1796000	1798000	It might have been on its other name, I don't know
1798000	1800000	Anyhow, lots of games were announced at the Konami event
1800000	1802000	One of them is Saw 2
1802000	1804000	That's right, Saw 2
1804000	1806000	Is going to be coming out
1806000	1808000	It's being developed by Zombie Studios
1808000	1810000	They did the first game as well
1810000	1812000	It's coming out for Halloween
1812000	1814000	Just in time for the movie
1814000	1816000	I think they have said that they will keep making those damn movies
1816000	1818000	Until they stop making money
1818000	1820000	Considering those movies cost less than 10 million dollars to make
1820000	1822000	You're gonna have a lot of Saw movies, guys
1822000	1824000	Unfortunately
1824000	1826000	I gotta admit though
1826000	1828000	I'm kind of surprised that a Saw sequel is happening
1828000	1830000	Because I didn't think the first game did very well
1830000	1832000	I could be wrong
1832000	1834000	It didn't do that well, I don't think
1836000	1838000	Honestly, having seen all the Saw movies
1840000	1842000	The last one was alright
1842000	1844000	I kind of liked it
1844000	1846000	But
1846000	1848000	It's getting to the point
1848000	1850000	The game or the movie?
1850000	1852000	The movie
1852000	1854000	The games have nothing to do with the movies
1854000	1856000	They don't follow the plots of the movies
1856000	1858000	They try to do their own thing
1858000	1860000	Sort of
1860000	1862000	But I'm just saying
1862000	1864000	They basically killed off
1864000	1866000	Jigsaw in the second movie
1866000	1868000	The third movie
1868000	1870000	Maybe the second movie
1870000	1872000	I can't remember which one
1872000	1874000	I think it was the second one
1874000	1876000	It kind of makes it difficult
1876000	1878000	To
1878000	1880000	Keep having this guy do it
1880000	1882000	Because now you have someone else
1882000	1884000	Taking over for him
1884000	1886000	It's just getting ridiculous now
1886000	1888000	Um
1888000	1890000	You know what?
1890000	1892000	According to VGcharts.com
1892000	1894000	Again, take this with a grain of salt
1894000	1896000	Because I don't know how accurate these numbers are
1896000	1898000	But according to VGcharts.com
1898000	1900000	Saw pushed.21 million
1900000	1902000	On the Xbox 360
1902000	1904000	That's 200,000
1904000	1906000	And then.23 million on Playstation 3
1906000	1908000	So it actually sold better on Playstation 3
1908000	1910000	And so that would be a combined half million
1910000	1912000	So
1912000	1914000	Not bad
1914000	1916000	But they only sold that I think right at launch
1916000	1918000	I don't think that they really
1918000	1920000	It was a title that kind of
1920000	1922000	Made its money the first
1922000	1924000	Two months and then just
1924000	1926000	Nothing
1926000	1928000	And I should say that is worldwide
1928000	1930000	Because actually the game did much better overseas
1930000	1932000	Than it did in the Americas
1932000	1934000	Which is kind of interesting
1934000	1936000	Oh and that explains why the PS3
1936000	1938000	Sold more
1938000	1940000	Actually the Xbox 360 sold more in America
1940000	1942000	And only 100,000 on PS3
1942000	1944000	Don't get me wrong it was an alright game
1944000	1946000	Again take those sales figures with a grain of salt
1946000	1948000	Yeah and I think the game was alright
1948000	1950000	It was kind of repetitive I guess
1950000	1952000	And you know
1952000	1954000	The new game though
1954000	1956000	Apparently is going to have some better puzzles in it
1956000	1958000	They were talking about one that was
1958000	1960000	Being shown off as a demo
1960000	1962000	And apparently no one figured it out
1962000	1964000	Unless they were told how to do it
1964000	1966000	So I don't know if that's good or not
1966000	1968000	But it's interesting
1968000	1970000	They're saying of course more
1970000	1972000	Yucky gross death machines
1972000	1974000	Which is the whole thing that kind of turns me off
1974000	1976000	Of the Saw series and I will admit
1976000	1978000	It's weird like I have no problem with
1978000	1980000	Konami's other franchise
1980000	1982000	Silent Hill but it's
1982000	1984000	I have no problem with the gore in that game
1984000	1986000	But it's Saw bugs me
1986000	1988000	I can't explain it and maybe it's because
1988000	1990000	Saw is a bit too real
1990000	1992000	Whereas like Silent Hill
1992000	1994000	Obviously Pyramid Head is not real
1994000	1996000	It's supernatural
1996000	1998000	It's a little more supernatural
1998000	2000000	I can't explain what the difference is
2000000	2002000	Saw just
2002000	2004000	I don't know
2004000	2006000	I've talked about this on the show before
2006000	2008000	It's just torture porn to me
2008000	2010000	It doesn't excite me
2010000	2012000	I get that there's people into it
2012000	2014000	But I'm just not one of them
2014000	2016000	Whatever they're making a new game
2016000	2018000	I guess the first one didn't sell as bad as we all think it did
2018000	2020000	If those numbers are any indication
2020000	2022000	I don't think a half million combined worldwide is terrible
2022000	2024000	Certainly there's games that do a hell of a lot worse
2024000	2026000	But I don't think it was a launch of a franchise
2026000	2028000	As they had hoped
2028000	2030000	They were hoping that this was going to be their next Silent Hill franchise
2030000	2032000	And
2032000	2034000	I think Silent Hill does a lot better
2034000	2036000	Interesting
2036000	2038000	Well Dark Sakura
2038000	2040000	What?
2040000	2042000	You have some more news for us out of Konami
2042000	2044000	Yes I do
2044000	2046000	But I'm still kind of
2046000	2048000	About it
2048000	2050000	There is another Silent Hill game
2050000	2052000	In the works for PS3 and Xbox 360
2052000	2058000	But they didn't really give out any other information about that
2058000	2060000	Just said that it's another one
2060000	2062000	I'm surprised by this news
2062000	2064000	I assumed that Silent Hill was done
2064000	2066000	Because I assumed that Homecoming did not perform well enough
2066000	2068000	It didn't
2068000	2070000	But I mean
2070000	2072000	Shattered Memories did okay
2072000	2074000	But I actually returned my copy
2074000	2078000	Wasn't the rumor that what they were showing
2078000	2080000	Like a Shattered Memories type of game
2080000	2082000	Not necessarily like Homecoming
2082000	2084000	I thought I heard something
2084000	2086000	The rumor is it's supposed to be like a
2086000	2088000	Like what Shattered Memories was to Silent Hill 1
2088000	2090000	This is supposed to be to Silent Hill 2 or something
2090000	2092000	I don't want that
2092000	2094000	I don't want to play that
2094000	2096000	I didn't really enjoy that much of Shattered Memories
2096000	2098000	Weird
2098000	2100000	I just like
2100000	2102000	Plain old good Silent Hill
2102000	2104000	Last decent one was 4
2104000	2106000	And that's it
2106000	2108000	Silent Hill Shattered Memories on the Wii
2108000	2110000	.18 million
2110000	2112000	So that's less than
2112000	2114000	And again these numbers are coming from vgcharts.com
2114000	2116000	That's much less than what Saw moved
2116000	2118000	How did Homecoming do?
2118000	2120000	The problem is
2120000	2122000	Homecoming moved.36 million
2122000	2124000	That's on the 360
2124000	2136880	And how much on PS
2136880	2138880	Whatever the reason
2138880	2140880	You can put out really awesome mature games on it
2140880	2142880	But no one's buying them
2142880	2144880	Well the other thing that strikes me odd
2144880	2146880	About the fact that they're continuing the Silent Hill franchise
2146880	2148880	I mean even if the Silent Hill Wii game
2148880	2150880	Was critically well received
2150880	2152880	Is the departure of Akira Yamaoka
2152880	2154880	Because to me
2154880	2156880	He was such a key component of that franchise
2156880	2158880	I really don't see how they can continue it without him
2158880	2160880	I mean if it's true that they're just
2160880	2162880	Redoing the second game
2162880	2164880	I suppose I can see that
2164880	2166880	Because how much did he really
2166880	2168880	Contribute to Shattered Memories
2168880	2170880	I don't think he did a lot
2170880	2172880	For that game
2172880	2174880	Did he even do the soundtrack?
2174880	2176880	Yeah he worked on the soundtrack
2176880	2178880	I think they finally learned
2178880	2184880	That they really can't do anything else with the series
2184880	2186880	They don't have the right kind of
2186880	2188880	I think thought process to take it where it needs to go
2188880	2190880	That's just my thought
2190880	2192880	Interesting comment from the chat room
2192880	2194880	Because this could
2194880	2196880	Spar another discussion here
2196880	2198880	S.H.O. 100 Matt in our chat room
2198880	2200880	I remember the great horror movies of the 80s
2200880	2202880	When it was about the scare
2202880	2204880	No matter how cheesy the effects were
2204880	2206880	Whereas now it's shot gore
2206880	2208880	He goes on to say the thing
2208880	2210880	80s version is better than any Saw or Hostile movie
2210880	2212880	And then somebody brought up
2212880	2214880	DJ Dark Knight says
2214880	2216880	Nightmare on Elm Street, nothing more
2216880	2218880	And Friday the 13th
2218880	2220880	And it's interesting because they've remade
2220880	2222880	I mean Nightmare on Elm Street is coming out in a couple of weeks
2222880	2224880	Right?
2224880	2226880	And it seems odd to me that those are not turning into games
2226880	2228880	I mean
2228880	2230880	Sure there was a Friday the 13th game
2230880	2232880	Years and years ago on the NES
2232880	2234880	Which by the way I enjoyed way more than most people did
2234880	2236880	Just on the tangent
2236880	2238880	I actually
2238880	2240880	I hate to say it because I know I'm going to get made fun of
2240880	2242880	But I don't care
2242880	2244880	I actually enjoyed the Friday the 13th game when I was younger
2244880	2246880	It made sense to me and I had a lot of fun playing it
2246880	2248880	It was hard as hell
2248880	2250880	That angry video game nerd
2250880	2252880	His review of it, it was funny
2252880	2254880	And there was a Nightmare on Elm Street game too
2254880	2256880	If I remember right
2256880	2258880	Which was crap
2258880	2260880	It was crap, but if my memory is right
2260880	2262880	It was one of the very few Nintendo games
2262880	2264880	That used that four player expansion
2264880	2266880	They had
2266880	2268880	Remember how they had the four player thing on the NES
2268880	2270880	There was very few games that used it
2270880	2272880	I know that you could change your main character
2272880	2274880	And that it was still really lame
2274880	2276880	And every character sucked
2276880	2278880	Pretty much
2278880	2280880	With the Saw and the horror franchises
2280880	2282880	Doesn't it seem odd to anyone
2282880	2284880	That there is not a video game
2284880	2286880	Coming out for Nightmare on Elm Street
2286880	2288880	Or even that there wasn't one for Friday the 13th
2288880	2290880	There hasn't been one for Halloween
2290880	2292880	Or any of the horror movies
2292880	2294880	They've made in quite some time
2294880	2296880	No, I'm not surprised
2296880	2298880	Why is that?
2298880	2300880	First you have to pay the licenses
2300880	2302880	For that and they have an idea
2302880	2304880	Of how well
2304880	2306880	These games
2306880	2308880	Perform
2308880	2310880	And something like that it would be kind of hard to expand on
2310880	2312880	The storyline
2312880	2314880	And stuff like for example Nightmare on Elm Street
2314880	2316880	Well
2316880	2318880	What the hell would the game be about
2318880	2320880	I mean you basically going after
2320880	2322880	Freddy I guess
2322880	2324880	Or you know trying to escape him
2324880	2326880	It's just hard to expand on
2326880	2328880	How you know whether enemies and stuff
2328880	2330880	Are you going to have in it
2330880	2332880	It just doesn't translate well into a game
2332880	2334880	It's strange though
2334880	2336880	Because so many movies that come out these days
2336880	2338880	Get games with it like you know Avatar had a game
2338880	2340880	Alice in Wonderland had a game
2340880	2342880	Avatar learned itself very well to the game
2342880	2344880	Yeah that's easy though to do
2344880	2346880	There's plenty of characters in that
2346880	2348880	That you can build a game off of
2348880	2350880	And same with the Alice in Wonderland
2350880	2352880	So there's plenty of creatures and enemies
2352880	2354880	And stuff you can create for the game
2354880	2356880	I read a very interesting article this last week
2356880	2358880	That said that
2358880	2360880	It was on Yahoo
2360880	2362880	And the little teaser was
2362880	2364880	This movie franchise
2364880	2366880	Could have been a video game
2366880	2368880	This movie franchise
2368880	2370880	Is losing tons of potential dollars
2370880	2372880	Because there is no video game
2372880	2374880	And you click on it to find out what franchise they're talking about
2374880	2376880	Any guess?
2376880	2378880	Twilight because I read this
2378880	2380880	What's funny is they forgot
2380880	2382880	There is a game based on Twilight
2382880	2384880	Well it's the scenic game
2384880	2386880	That's still a game and it's based on Twilight
2386880	2388880	So they're stupid because they did the research
2388880	2390880	I blame
2390880	2392880	No
2392880	2394880	I don't want to see it either
2394880	2396880	But they make a point
2396880	2398880	It's strange that there is no
2398880	2400880	Twilight video game
2400880	2402880	I don't want to see it either
2402880	2404880	It doesn't make a good game that's why
2404880	2406880	But if they make a game for Alice in Wonderland
2406880	2408880	And Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
2408880	2410880	There's more characters
2410880	2412880	Push A to sparkle
2412880	2414880	Exactly it's not like
2414880	2416880	She's running around slaying
2416880	2418880	Vampires or slaying werewolves or whatever
2418880	2420880	She's just some whiny emo chick
2420880	2422880	And that's
2422880	2424880	You can't make a game based on that
2424880	2426880	Push B to lock the door and cry
2426880	2428880	I mean it's seriously
2428880	2430880	You can't, you can't really do that
2430880	2432880	There's no
2432880	2434880	Enemies for the fight, she doesn't do that
2434880	2436880	It doesn't translate well, they'd be like
2436880	2438880	The equivalent of making a game based off
2438880	2440880	Of
2440880	2442880	Anything
2442880	2444880	Like the money pit
2444880	2446880	Or you know just
2446880	2448880	I'm getting yelled at by chatters because they're saying
2448880	2450880	Rama's saying no Twilight game for PS3 360
2450880	2452880	That's a smart move, Tigerclaw says don't give them any ideas
2452880	2454880	Do you really want a Twilight MMO?
2454880	2456880	Again, I have zero interest in the game
2456880	2458880	But the capitalist
2458880	2460880	Money making
2460880	2462880	America fuck yeah side of me
2462880	2464880	That's all about making money does say
2464880	2466880	You know a Twilight game on the Wii
2466880	2468880	That's not, I'm talking about an actual Twilight game
2468880	2470880	Is a lost opportunity
2470880	2472880	It really is, I have
2472880	2474880	No fucking interest in it but
2474880	2476880	I know there's a lot of girls that would play it
2476880	2478880	Here's how you do it, okay, and this is how you can
2478880	2480880	Translate most of those games that don't
2480880	2482880	Necessarily, or most of those movies that don't
2482880	2484880	Necessarily work as games into games
2484880	2486880	And have them still be
2486880	2488880	Alright
2488880	2490880	You do them the way they did
2490880	2492880	Heavy Rain
2492880	2494880	That's the only way you can do it
2494880	2496880	Is that you have some sort of context based
2496880	2498880	Game
2498880	2500880	That has a narrative
2500880	2502880	That looks just like the movie
2502880	2504880	That's really the only way you can do it because
2504880	2506880	As far as being an action game
2506880	2508880	Or anything like that, you can't do that
2508880	2510880	With these games, it makes no sense
2510880	2512880	Frisbee in our chatroom says
2512880	2514880	Hey, I'd like a Twilight game if you got to play
2514880	2516880	As Blade
2516880	2518880	They really
2518880	2520880	Could do the
2520880	2522880	A dating sim
2522880	2524880	You know
2524880	2526880	And that would sell amongst the
2526880	2528880	God, that just makes me feel dirty
2528880	2530880	What was that shirt I saw at Hot Topic?
2530880	2532880	And then Buffy staked Edward, the end
2532880	2534880	That's great
2534880	2536880	I would wear that shirt
2536880	2538880	It was pretty awesome
2538880	2540880	I knew you would wear that shirt, okay, sorry
2540880	2542880	I would rock that with pride
2542880	2544880	Look, I want to put out a formal apology to our listeners
2544880	2546880	And everybody for bringing up Twilight on
2546880	2548880	Orange Lontrenio, it was inappropriate of me
2548880	2550880	And I apologize, so
2550880	2552880	Please, let's move on with a different video game
2552880	2554880	It'll never happen again
2554880	2556880	I'm
2556880	2558880	Do you think that I'm having an allergic reaction
2558880	2560880	To that, Rob? No, you're just sparkling
2560880	2562880	Ahh
2564880	2566880	Loki, help
2566880	2568880	Loki, help! I'm sorry
2568880	2570880	Well, one easy way to defeat
2570880	2572880	The Twilight series is to take
2572880	2574880	A nice gun with a chainsaw
2574880	2576880	And rip it in half
2576880	2578880	And that's what you can possibly do in the new
2578880	2580880	Gears of War game, which, funny enough
2580880	2582880	Was supposed to be announced on the Jimmy Fallon
2582880	2584880	Show, but apparently
2584880	2586880	It got bumped to Monday
2586880	2588880	And
2588880	2590880	Nobody told Xbox Live
2590880	2592880	Because apparently on the Xbox Live
2592880	2594880	Marketplace, there is a wonderful banner
2594880	2596880	Announcing the Gears of War 3
2596880	2598880	Game, which will be
2598880	2600880	Coming April
2600880	2602880	2011
2602880	2604880	That's a year off
2604880	2606880	Yeah
2606880	2608880	And I just want to point out
2608880	2610880	I speculated earlier this year that
2610880	2612880	Gears of War 3 would be an E3 announcement
2612880	2614880	So maybe I screwed that up, but
2614880	2616880	That it was going to support Project Natal
2616880	2618880	Is that, does that seem to be the case?
2618880	2620880	Doesn't say
2620880	2622880	Don't know, but there's been some sort of
2622880	2624880	Rumors saying that the
2624880	2626880	It will feature, I guess, underwater
2626880	2628880	Combat this time and mech suits
2628880	2630880	I
2630880	2632880	Well, I mean, not that I think it needs
2632880	2634880	To support Natal, it was just kind of my gut feeling
2634880	2636880	Was they were really, they've been really
2636880	2638880	Really quiet about such a big franchise
2638880	2640880	For them, and so I kind of thought that
2640880	2642880	It was going to be like, oh Gears of War 3
2642880	2644880	E3 and it's Natal, that's why
2644880	2646880	We've kept it so under the wrap
2646880	2648880	Under the wraps, but
2648880	2650880	I guess, you know
2650880	2652880	We'll hear more about it, maybe
2652880	2654880	If you want to watch Jimmy Fallon on Monday, I guess
2654880	2656880	Or just wait for the YouTube to hit
2656880	2658880	15 minutes later
2658880	2660880	Because, you know, I'd rather
2660880	2662880	Not subject myself to
2662880	2664880	An hour of that, I just watched the highlights
2664880	2666880	Actually, I have to admit, I'm not
2666880	2668880	Huge on Gears of War either, I'm just not
2668880	2670880	Good at it, like Gears of War
2670880	2672880	A, I suck at first person shooters
2672880	2674880	To begin with, B, the thing about
2674880	2676880	Gears of War is it's very about like cover
2676880	2678880	And very like, like stealth and being able
2678880	2680880	To move around and be very tactical
2680880	2682880	Whereas, I like, if I'm going to play
2682880	2684880	An FPS, I've got to play something like Quake 3
2684880	2686880	Which is just kamikaze, run out there
2686880	2688880	Shoot everybody with rocket launchers, kill kill
2688880	2690880	Die die, you know, type of
2690880	2692880	Stuff, I'm not good at Gears of War because
2692880	2694880	I have, I can't cover
2694880	2696880	Like, I just run out and shoot everything
2696880	2698880	And I always die
2698880	2700880	So
2700880	2702880	And it's stuff like that is why
2702880	2704880	You know, Gears of War
2704880	2706880	Makes a better game franchise than
2706880	2708880	Twilight, because there's no
2708880	2710880	Rocket launchers and
2710880	2712880	I mean, there's people dying, but
2712880	2714880	They just whine about it
2714880	2716880	SSG100Matt
2716880	2718880	Says, don't support NBC, go Team Coco
2718880	2720880	So,
2720880	2722880	It's saying that you shouldn't, you shouldn't
2722880	2724880	Watch the show anyway, you should just wait for
2724880	2726880	Whatever will show up on Xbox
2726880	2728880	Live inevitably anyway
2728880	2730880	In support of Coco
2730880	2732880	Who I'm seeing live next week
2732880	2734880	Very excited
2734880	2736880	Well, yay for you Rob
2736880	2738880	That's right, I should buy tickets for that
2738880	2740880	I think they're all sold out everywhere
2740880	2742880	Well, I meant for Sacramento
2742880	2744880	I don't know
2744880	2746880	Alright
2746880	2748880	Anyhow, moving on to another story and
2748880	2750880	Yeah, those tickets were pretty expensive
2750880	2752880	But this is even more expensive
2752880	2754880	Apparently, Warhammer Online
2754880	2756880	Or Mythic Entertainment if you will
2756880	2758880	The makers of Warhammer Online
2758880	2760880	Somehow charged a $14.99
2760880	2762880	Monthly fee several times
2762880	2764880	To gamers this past week
2764880	2766880	Dozens of times, in fact there's a screenshot
2766880	2768880	Here of a banking record where
2768880	2770880	That monthly fee was charged
2770880	2772880	It looks like
2772880	2774880	17 times on somebody's
2774880	2776880	On somebody's banking log here
2776880	2778880	And that means like
2778880	2780880	An overcharge of like
2780880	2782880	Between $200 and $500
2782880	2784880	Apparently, one player is reporting
2784880	2786880	That they were charged for
2786880	2788880	$1,013.12
2788880	2790880	Because it had just come up that a six month
2790880	2792880	Subscription was up and he got charged
2792880	2794880	For that like multiple times
2794880	2796880	Not cool because
2796880	2798880	A, you don't know what caused the error
2798880	2800880	Which is gonna be bad for EA and
2800880	2802880	Mythic
2802880	2804880	They're trying to refund the fees within 24 to 36 hours
2804880	2806880	But here's the problem
2806880	2808880	People are gonna start bouncing
2808880	2810880	Checks, they're gonna overdraft
2810880	2812880	And they're gonna threaten
2812880	2814880	Mythic or EA with this
2814880	2816880	EA's gonna have to pay for all these overdraft
2816880	2818880	Fees that they cause
2818880	2820880	Without a doubt
2820880	2822880	And so that's just not pretty for them
2822880	2824880	That sets them back, that's a big boo boo
2824880	2826880	But you gotta be, that's the one reason
2826880	2828880	To be careful with these automatic withdrawals
2828880	2830880	But it stinks because so many games
2830880	2832880	Kinda require them in this day and age
2832880	2834880	But makes you think about maybe
2834880	2836880	Using those prepaid cards instead
2836880	2838880	Because you don't want something like this
2838880	2840880	Happening to you I'm sure
2840880	2842880	I mean I don't think anybody
2842880	2844880	Did this intentionally or purposely
2844880	2846880	I mean surely it was an error, it's just
2846880	2848880	A really crappy error
2848880	2850880	That is just
2850880	2852880	Really no one wins in this scenario
2852880	2854880	No one wins
2854880	2856880	And it's not like Warhammer Online was a game that was
2856880	2858880	It kinda didn't need
2858880	2860880	Something like this on its reputation
2860880	2862880	Right now, it's very unfortunate
2862880	2864880	Can you imagine if something like that happened with WoW?
2864880	2866880	Oh my gosh
2866880	2868880	Oh my gosh, banks would go under
2868880	2870880	From all the people that would complain
2870880	2872880	And rise up
2872880	2874880	My gosh
2874880	2876880	I don't think it affected everyone that played
2876880	2878880	But I think just those that probably had their statements
2878880	2880880	Renewed on a certain day but still
2880880	2882880	Stinks, too bad for them
2882880	2884880	Let's see
2884880	2886880	Rama in our chat says
2886880	2888880	That happened to me with a hotel for Anime Boston
2888880	2890880	Took them two weeks to refund my money
2890880	2892880	So, so irritating
2892880	2894880	That companies can do that
2894880	2896880	But you know what, if it results in overdraft fees
2896880	2898880	And it's this company's fault
2898880	2900880	You should take them to task for it
2900880	2902880	They'll refund the money, they have to
2902880	2904880	Alright, anyhow
2904880	2906880	That's messed up
2906880	2908880	I know
2908880	2910880	I mean, I looked at that and I was just like
2910880	2912880	Yet another reason to hate Warhammer
2912880	2914880	You know what though, that could have happened at any game though
2914880	2916880	Because I would bet money
2916880	2920880	That EA Mythic contracts another company to handle all this
2920880	2922880	And that company botched up
2922880	2925880	And it's just really unfortunate
2925880	2927880	Because like I said, yeah, Warhammer already
2927880	2929880	Hasn't had the greatest rep
2929880	2931880	I mean, it has its loyal fan base
2931880	2933880	But it's definitely not been the wow killer
2933880	2934880	It was originally imagined to be
2934880	2936880	I played it for a while, it was okay
2936880	2938880	It's just, you know, I didn't get everything out of it
2938880	2940880	I was hoping for
2940880	2942880	Well, how about something happier?
2942880	2944880	How about it?
2944880	2946880	Doctor Who?
2946880	2948880	On PC, we get a Doctor Who game
2948880	2950880	Who?
2950880	2952880	Doctor
2952880	2954880	Who?
2954880	2956880	Do not make me go hunt down my sonic screwdriver please
2956880	2958880	Anyway
2958880	2960880	Starting on June 2010
2960880	2962880	There are going to be four
2962880	2964880	Interactive episodes
2964880	2966880	That are going to be free on the
2966880	2968880	BBC Doctor Who website
2968880	2970880	With the current cast
2970880	2974880	And the new producer, writer guy
2974880	2976880	And
2976880	2978880	A lot of
2978880	2982880	The story elements, I guess, going on with what's currently
2982880	2984880	I guess going to happen in this season
2984880	2986880	And it's being developed by Sumo Digital
2986880	2988880	They
2988880	2990880	It actually was said by
2990880	2992880	The head of drama for BBC Wales
2992880	2994880	The executive producer for Doctor Who
2994880	2996880	The director of the series
2996880	2998880	The director of the series
2998880	3000880	The executive producer for Doctor Who
3000880	3002880	There aren't going to be
3002880	3004880	13 episodes
3004880	3006880	There will be 17 of which
3006880	3008880	Are interactive
3008880	3010880	Interesting
3010880	3012880	So they're really considering this part of the television arc
3012880	3014880	Yep
3014880	3016880	Of course if they let us download it over here
3016880	3018880	Then I will
3018880	3020880	Talk to people
3020880	3022880	Yeah, exactly
3022880	3024880	Torchwood?
3024880	3026880	Any chance we can get a Torchwood game?
3026880	3028880	Are we ever going to ever get Torchwood?
3028880	3030880	No, it's over
3030880	3032880	But that doesn't mean they won't do games
3032880	3034880	Yes it does
3034880	3036880	They ended it, they completely ended it
3036880	3038880	But can't they go back and do games
3038880	3040880	From, you know, the canon earlier
3040880	3042880	In the show or something?
3042880	3044880	I seriously doubt that's going to happen
3044880	3046880	They do that all the time with franchises that are over
3046880	3048880	They reinvigorate it for a game
3048880	3050880	Okay, I'll give you that
3050880	3052880	Where's my northern exposure?
3052880	3054880	Shut up
3054880	3056880	Actually, I'll say this not to deviate
3056880	3058880	To sci-fi nerd-dom for a minute here
3058880	3060880	But wasn't there a talk that Fox wanted to do
3060880	3062880	An American version of Torchwood?
3062880	3064880	Dear God, no, I hope not
3064880	3066880	And something about
3066880	3068880	The guy, why can't I remember his name?
3068880	3070880	The guy that plays Captain Jack
3070880	3072880	They actually were thinking of having him
3072880	3074880	Do it
3074880	3076880	No, um
3076880	3078880	Not that Captain Jack, the other one
3078880	3080880	Why can't I remember his name? Oh my God
3080880	3082880	John Barrowman
3082880	3084880	The guy that played Captain Jack
3084880	3086880	And sang all those songs and dressed up like a captain
3086880	3088880	With hoochies hanging off of him
3088880	3090880	That Captain Jack?
3090880	3092880	No, not that Captain Jack
3092880	3094880	John Barrowman
3094880	3096880	This is Captain Jack
3096880	3098880	It's such a common name
3098880	3100880	How about release dates, Loki?
3100880	3102880	Captain Gack
3102880	3104880	This week, there's
3104880	3106880	Well, there's not a lot because we're in the month of April
3106880	3108880	And April's really light
3108880	3110880	There are some notable things
3110880	3112880	First off, of course
3112880	3114880	Splinter Cell Conviction
3114880	3116880	Coming out on Xbox 360
3116880	3118880	That's pretty sweet
3118880	3120880	Grand Theft Auto episodes
3120880	3122880	From Liberty City
3122880	3124880	Making its way out onto the Playstation 3
3124880	3126880	As well as PC
3126880	3128880	Blood Bowl finally coming out
3128880	3130880	On PSP this week as well
3130880	3134880	And there's gonna be
3134880	3136880	Nothing else, I guess
3136880	3138880	That is one hell of a light week
3138880	3140880	Alright, let's go to
3140880	3142880	I need to say something real quick
3142880	3144880	Okay
3144880	3146880	Since I hate having to spell this shit out
3146880	3148880	Because apparently I do every time I state something
3148880	3150880	That's my opinion
3150880	3152880	When I say something is over
3152880	3154880	I'm typically meaning it's over for me
3154880	3156880	I don't care
3156880	3158880	It's good
3158880	3160880	It's over for me, I don't care
3160880	3162880	It's gone
3162880	3166880	Okay, well I took what you said to mean that the show is actually over
3166880	3168880	So it's not over, it's just you've written it off
3168880	3170880	Because you don't like the direction it's going in
3170880	3172880	They got rid of everybody
3172880	3174880	Except for one person
3174880	3178880	There's nothing more in that for me to watch
3178880	3180880	Okay, well as someone who doesn't watch the show
3180880	3182880	I have no idea, so there you go
3182880	3184880	Alright, Japanese release dates
3184880	3186880	No More Heroes
3186880	3188880	Is coming out on the Xbox 360
3188880	3190880	And yeah, I heard about that
3190880	3192880	That they were going to remake that for the 360
3192880	3194880	Because mature games don't do very well on the Wii
3194880	3196880	It's going to be awesome
3196880	3198880	So there it is on its way on the 360 this week
3198880	3200880	And there's lots of people like Loki
3200880	3202880	Who will probably use his new JTAG
3202880	3204880	Not creepy and ominously donated 360 to play
3204880	3206880	It could be a bomb, I haven't opened it up yet
3206880	3208880	Loki
3208880	3210880	I'm going to get that screen somewhere
3210880	3212880	Alright, on the Playstation 3
3212880	3214880	Also gets a version of No More Heroes
3214880	3216880	As well, it's a pretty dry week otherwise
3216880	3218880	I guess that's kind of the anchor
3218880	3220880	And there you go, you can import the PS3 version
3220880	3222880	If you don't have a modded console
3222880	3224880	That's true, because PS3 is region free
3224880	3226880	Of course it's all going to be in Japanese
3226880	3228880	But who cares
3228880	3230880	Might be able to get through it anyway
3230880	3232880	Nintendo Wii, not a thing this week
3232880	3234880	You got to wait until the 22nd for really any new games
3234880	3236880	Playstation 2
3236880	3238880	Clover no Kunen no Alice comes out
3238880	3240880	As well as Psycho Shogi
3240880	3242880	Gekyashashi Special
3242880	3244880	That's just a price reduction
3244880	3246880	About the equivalent of 20 bucks in Japan
3246880	3248880	So look for that, that's a gambling game though
3248880	3250880	I mean really, do you guys import gambling games?
3250880	3252880	I don't think you do
3252880	3254880	On the Nintendo DS, Let's Science with Marie and Gully
3254880	3256880	That's a big game coming out this week
3256880	3258880	On the Nintendo DS
3258880	3260880	I've never heard of this game
3260880	3262880	Let's Science, is that like Science Mama?
3262880	3264880	I don't know
3264880	3266880	I know it has little equations in it
3266880	3268880	And all this other stuff
3268880	3270880	Dekitayo Mama
3270880	3272880	Mitsugo no Kumasan
3272880	3274880	Otoko no Koko
3274880	3276880	That is not Cookie Mama, I thought it was
3276880	3278880	Because I saw Mama in the title
3278880	3280880	Otoko means boy
3280880	3282880	It's like a boy's hero
3282880	3284880	Here's a boy
3284880	3286880	Like a child's playground or something
3286880	3288880	Anyhow
3288880	3290880	That's the DS
3290880	3292880	Quickly looking at the PSP
3292880	3294880	Sokoku no Kusabi
3294880	3296880	Hiro no Kakara 3 comes out this week
3296880	3298880	That is
3298880	3300880	An action game
3300880	3302880	I'm trying to see if this is an established franchise
3302880	3304880	Because it's 3
3304880	3306880	I don't recognize it
3306880	3308880	It looks like it's based on an anime
3308880	3310880	Because it has really pretty cut scene looking things in it
3310880	3312880	A lot of talking and chatting in the game
3312880	3314880	Can't tell what that is though
3314880	3316880	Sorry, I'm not up to speed on all of my Japanese
3316880	3318880	What is this?
3318880	3320880	Maybe this is it
3320880	3322880	There's a limited edition of it coming out as well
3322880	3324880	I was trying to see if that would tell me what it is
3324880	3326880	Nope
3326880	3328880	Oh well
3328880	3330880	That's coming out on the PSP
3330880	3332880	And that's it for Japanese release dates
3332880	3334880	Dark Sakura, how about
3334880	3336880	Yeah, I just smacked the thing
3336880	3338880	How about The Old Kingdom
3338880	3340880	Well, on the 15th we have Final Fight Double Impact
3340880	3344880	We have Sam & Max The Devil's Playground Episode 1
3344880	3346880	The Penal Zone
3346880	3348880	And on the 16th we have
3348880	3350880	Samurai Shodown Sen
3350880	3352880	Grand Theft Auto 4
3352880	3354880	Episodes from Liberty City
3354880	3356880	And Splinter Cell Conviction
3356880	3358880	Just a few more stories for you guys
3358880	3360880	Then we're going to get into the classic game of the week
3360880	3362880	But first
3362880	3364880	A few more news stories for you guys
3364880	3366880	Loki
3366880	3368880	Yes, of course with the new update
3368880	3370880	3.21
3370880	3372880	That removes
3372880	3374880	Linux from the Playstation 3
3374880	3376880	Which is retarded
3376880	3378880	I'll just tell you right now
3378880	3380880	Yeah, you weren't here last week
3380880	3382880	I'm really curious about your thoughts on this whole thing
3382880	3384880	But you know, both Dark Sakura and I were kind of just like
3384880	3386880	Well, we haven't really used it
3386880	3388880	I mean, Dark Sakura is a Linux fan
3388880	3390880	So obviously she's disappointed
3390880	3392880	I don't know, what do you think?
3392880	3394880	Since Sonya made a big to-do about
3394880	3396880	Trying to patch it up, I'm not updating my system
3396880	3398880	Until I see what happens
3398880	3400880	Don't you kind of have to?
3400880	3402880	If you want to play anything online
3402880	3404880	Because it does that whole thing where it says
3404880	3406880	There is a system update available
3406880	3408880	If you want to connect to Playstation Network for anything
3408880	3410880	You have to upgrade
3410880	3412880	I don't connect to Playstation Network
3412880	3414880	Because I don't play anything on it
3414880	3416880	Well then you'll be fine, I'm just saying
3416880	3418880	I mean, even to like
3418880	3420880	Have the online leaderboards or anything
3420880	3422880	You can't play those without
3422880	3424880	Updating
3424880	3426880	Because my system wasn't updated
3426880	3428880	I haven't played anything on Playstation 3 this week
3428880	3430880	But I went into a game on there the other night
3430880	3432880	Actually I was showing a friend our little cameo
3432880	3434880	In the Namco Museum game
3434880	3436880	But that game wants to connect for leaderboards
3436880	3438880	And it was not working right
3438880	3440880	Because it needed me to update
3440880	3442880	That's when you unhook it from the internet
3442880	3444880	I'm just saying, you're going to be very limited
3444880	3446880	Until you update
3446880	3448880	I'm okay
3448880	3450880	Anyways, so what's important about this is
3450880	3452880	Apparently the guy GeoHot
3452880	3454880	Who has done different
3454880	3456880	Hacks on the iPhone
3456880	3458880	And whatnot
3458880	3460880	He's one of the first guys
3460880	3462880	Jail broke some of those I guess
3462880	3464880	Anyways
3464880	3466880	So he is
3466880	3468880	He put out a video
3468880	3470880	That shows him with the
3470880	3472880	A modded 3.21
3472880	3474880	System with actually
3474880	3476880	The option to install the other OS
3476880	3478880	Still, so basically
3478880	3480880	He patched out their patch
3480880	3482880	And just added the update or something
3482880	3484880	And he says it's very easy to do
3484880	3486880	But he also says that he's
3486880	3488880	Not going to necessarily program anything
3488880	3490880	So that people can
3490880	3492880	Build like
3492880	3494880	You know
3494880	3496880	At least the pirate stuff
3496880	3498880	But right now it's just doing it for the other operating system
3498880	3500880	But that makes me wonder
3500880	3502880	How long
3502880	3504880	Because it's just a matter of time
3504880	3506880	And in fact actually
3506880	3508880	His quote basically
3508880	3510880	He says
3510880	3512880	Basically saying that because of this
3512880	3514880	They've potentially turned
3514880	3516880	100,000 plus legit
3516880	3518880	Users into hackers
3518880	3520880	Because now they're going to try to find
3520880	3522880	They weren't caring before about trying to
3522880	3524880	Break it to add Linux to it
3524880	3526880	But now that they're removing it
3526880	3528880	They're going to be more diligent in trying to
3528880	3530880	Hack the PS3
3530880	3532880	Well it also just seems like no surprise that
3532880	3534880	You know this was cracked in minutes
3534880	3536880	You know
3536880	3538880	Is essentially what Sony did
3538880	3540880	Is they just released something that didn't like
3540880	3542880	Actually remove the feature
3542880	3544880	But just like remove the menu item
3544880	3546880	Or something you know
3546880	3548880	It sounds like this hack was so
3548880	3550880	Easy that this guy did
3550880	3552880	Like Sony didn't really take it out
3552880	3554880	They just took out your ability to access it
3554880	3556880	Well the PS3 and the PSP
3556880	3558880	For example their operating systems
3558880	3560880	Are very similar especially the way
3560880	3562880	Their patch files and stuff come over
3562880	3564880	That you know if you're familiar with the PSP
3564880	3566880	You're probably going to have an easy way
3566880	3568880	Around the Playstation 3
3568880	3570880	It's just there's certain things
3570880	3572880	That they haven't figured out yet
3572880	3574880	And apparently this guy has figured out ways
3574880	3576880	Around it
3576880	3578880	Now another kind of story that ties in with this
3578880	3580880	Is apparently there was a guy
3580880	3582880	A European PS3 owner who
3582880	3584880	Received I guess
3584880	3586880	A credit for
3586880	3588880	You know about 84 pounds
3588880	3590880	I guess
3590880	3592880	From Amazon because
3592880	3594880	He filed a complaint with the retailer
3594880	3596880	Saying that the firmware update
3596880	3598880	Violated some sort of
3598880	3600880	European law
3600880	3602880	Basically saying that the console
3602880	3604880	No longer performed as advertised
3604880	3606880	And you know and I do think that
3606880	3608880	Is something though I mean if you're putting
3608880	3610880	On the box or you had on the box
3610880	3612880	Right now they have all these slim systems and stuff
3612880	3614880	Just before you go there
3614880	3616880	In the US it's not on the box
3616880	3618880	I can't speak for the UK but I only know this
3618880	3620880	Cause last week on Bobby's show cause right before the call
3620880	3622880	He actually had the box and he said it's not on the box
3622880	3624880	Ok but still though
3624880	3626880	I don't know about the UK but this is the US
3626880	3628880	It was still a feature though that they advertised
3628880	3630880	And then I guess
3630880	3632880	But I guess you could say the same thing with
3632880	3634880	Playstation 2 backwards compatibility
3634880	3636880	It was something that you know
3636880	3638880	They removed from
3638880	3640880	Their new systems but it's not like
3640880	3642880	It was there on those systems
3642880	3644880	To begin with and then they took it out because
3644880	3646880	You know what hey we just don't want you to play
3646880	3648880	Playstation 2 games anymore
3648880	3650880	It's still no matter how insignificant
3650880	3652880	It is it still sucks
3652880	3654880	That they removed it because
3654880	3656880	I mean this is something
3656880	3658880	You may be paying for and granted it's not a feature
3658880	3660880	That I use but that'd be the same thing
3660880	3662880	If like oh well I don't really watch
3662880	3664880	Blu-ray movies on my you know PS3
3664880	3666880	And then they send a patch over that you know
3666880	3668880	Now prevents me from watching
3668880	3670880	Blu-ray movies
3670880	3672880	Granted it wasn't a feature I was using
3672880	3674880	It's still like you're removing a feature
3674880	3676880	Off the console
3676880	3678880	And yeah
3678880	3680880	People should be pissed because
3680880	3682880	Granted they're doing this for security reasons
3682880	3684880	But what if they
3684880	3686880	Find a way around you know
3686880	3688880	Something else
3688880	3690880	What other features are going to be removed
3690880	3692880	I don't know
3692880	3694880	It's just a case of a couple
3694880	3696880	Bad apples ruining the barrel I think
3696880	3698880	You know but I think it was a little silly for
3698880	3700880	You know I said this earlier but I think it was
3700880	3702880	Silly for Sony to put that feature in in the
3702880	3704880	First place
3704880	3706880	If they're closing it up because
3706880	3708880	Of piracy because Linux kind of lent itself
3708880	3710880	To piracy anyway and I'm not talking about PS3
3710880	3712880	Necessarily but everybody knew there was emulators
3712880	3714880	Out there for the NES and you know
3714880	3716880	But see now though with Linux
3716880	3718880	Installed on these systems they can sell you know
3718880	3720880	A ton of them to different like universities
3720880	3722880	Or whatever using them as number crunchers
3722880	3724880	It's an easy way to make up some console
3724880	3726880	Sales you know just uh
3726880	3728880	Hey look you can run Linux on it it's like a little
3728880	3730880	Portable super computer you know they're even
3730880	3732880	Saying oh yeah it's you know it's
3732880	3734880	A computer system it's not a game system
3734880	3736880	It's a computer system
3736880	3738880	You know when of course the rumors
3738880	3740880	Were that they were doing that to evade taxes
3740880	3742880	Or whatever but uh
3744880	3746880	Still though now you're
3746880	3748880	I don't know
3748880	3750880	It's
3750880	3752880	They can do whatever they want I guess because
3752880	3754880	Since you know then user license agreement
3754880	3756880	Anyways just basically says you're leasing the
3756880	3758880	Console from them so
3758880	3760880	If they want to take features away I guess they can
3760880	3762880	But I you know
3762880	3764880	As a consumer I will
3764880	3766880	Probably think twice when it comes to the next
3766880	3768880	PlayStation system that they are
3768880	3770880	Advertising you know can do such
3770880	3772880	And such things you'll probably think twice
3772880	3774880	You know hey
3774880	3776880	Move later because it doesn't go their
3776880	3778880	Way
3778880	3780880	It is very interesting that they can just
3780880	3782880	Kind of do that I mean I'm and we
3782880	3784880	All accept that because it's in the
3784880	3786880	Agreements that we you know hit
3786880	3788880	A to get through real fast you know
3788880	3790880	Hun the Xbox
3790880	3792880	It just seems
3792880	3794880	I don't know
3794880	3796880	Well and also if you ever
3796880	3798880	Happen to click no then you just
3798880	3800880	Don't get to use it right? Exactly
3800880	3802880	I don't know it just seems
3802880	3804880	It's just kind of
3804880	3806880	Sad there's nothing to protect me
3806880	3808880	It would be different if it was just
3808880	3810880	Connecting to their online service and I
3810880	3812880	Understand yes they can prevent you from
3812880	3814880	Going to their online service for whatever
3814880	3816880	Reason if they want you to update and you don't want to
3816880	3818880	Then fine you can't connect to their online service
3818880	3820880	But you know
3820880	3822880	Offline games if you pop in a game or
3822880	3824880	Whatever it will just automatically patch your system
3824880	3826880	Up anyways you can't just say
3826880	3828880	No I don't want to install this patch
3828880	3830880	It's going to do it regardless
3830880	3832880	And they do it obviously as a security feature
3832880	3834880	So that you know you can't go and hack
3834880	3836880	The Playstation 3 but
3836880	3838880	Whatever
3838880	3840880	Then maybe they should have figured out a way to be able to
3840880	3842880	Leave the operating system on there and not
3842880	3844880	Have it you know
3844880	3846880	Have access to whatever that's
3846880	3848880	On the Playstation 3 that you can apparently
3848880	3850880	Hack the system with
3850880	3852880	Alright
3852880	3854880	Well turning to something
3854880	3856880	That is an old
3856880	3858880	Standby and reliable and you know
3858880	3860880	These are always coming and not going to get taken away from you
3860880	3862880	Pokemon that's right
3862880	3864880	Taking a step over to the Nintendo systems
3864880	3866880	Pokemon obviously those
3866880	3868880	Other games the what was it
3868880	3870880	Gold and silver remakes were
3870880	3872880	Released not that long ago and they come with little
3872880	3874880	Trainers that were all over
3874880	3876880	PAX East well
3876880	3878880	The games were successful enough
3878880	3880880	Obviously I mean the Pokemon
3880880	3882880	Black and Pokemon White have been announced
3882880	3884880	Those are the newest games for the Pokemon
3884880	3886880	Series they are going to be
3886880	3888880	Coming out this fall in Japan for the
3888880	3890880	Nintendo DS that is
3890880	3892880	DS not the 3DS
3892880	3894880	So these are still games I mean obviously the 3DS
3894880	3896880	Will play them as we know about
3896880	3898880	The 3DS so far but these games are being
3898880	3900880	Developed for the DS
3900880	3902880	More info is supposed to come in the next few weeks but the game
3902880	3904880	Is supposed to be out in fall and I imagine we'll see some of this
3904880	3906880	At E3 as well even though
3906880	3908880	The logo design is gorgeous
3908880	3910880	Even though the games probably won't come out in America for some time
3910880	3912880	What is so gorgeous about the design for you?
3912880	3914880	I just like it I just really like it it's
3914880	3916880	Copping I have this thing for
3916880	3918880	Black and White
3918880	3920880	And just with the red Pokeball in the background I think it's
3920880	3922880	Actually really eye catching and really well done
3922880	3924880	It's very interesting that they decided
3924880	3926880	Just to go with Black and White
3926880	3928880	Like you know just very
3928880	3930880	Plain colors if you will
3930880	3932880	None of this like Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald
3932880	3934880	Black and White
3934880	3936880	Honestly I think using
3936880	3938880	Black and White is
3938880	3940880	I always thought of just using
3940880	3942880	Black and White as being more classy
3942880	3944880	Than going for the
3944880	3946880	Sparkly poo
3946880	3948880	So a classier more refined Pokemon?
3948880	3950880	I think so I think that it takes a lot more talent
3950880	3952880	I mean I just
3952880	3954880	I prefer things being
3954880	3956880	You know pretty clean
3956880	3958880	In how they're you know done
3958880	3960880	Honestly I like the logo
3960880	3962880	The fact that I can actually look at it
3962880	3964880	And read it right away
3964880	3966880	I was kind of impressed with myself
3966880	3968880	Act F in our chat room says the third version
3968880	3970880	Is going to be gray
3970880	3972880	Make it easy huh?
3972880	3974880	Uh yep so more Pokemon
3974880	3976880	I'm just kind of surprised this information
3976880	3978880	Is coming out so soon after the release of the games
3978880	3980880	We just had here but at the same time
3980880	3982880	We have to remember
3982880	3984880	This news was tailored for Japan not really
3984880	3986880	For the US and those games have been out in Japan
3986880	3988880	For some time it's kind of like the news about the 3DS
3988880	3990880	Came out what like the day
3990880	3992880	That the DSIXL was released here
3994880	3996880	Interesting
3996880	3998880	We can only learn from like you know another
3998880	4000880	Company that has announced a revision
4000880	4002880	To their system
4002880	4004880	Right as they're launching their system
4004880	4006880	Hmm
4006880	4008880	That hasn't happened before has it?
4008880	4010880	Oh wait no it has
4010880	4012880	Yeah
4012880	4014880	Bochi Kawa in our chat room says classy Pokemon
4014880	4016880	A squirrel in a top hat with a cane
4016880	4018880	Possibly
4018880	4020880	And Frisbee in chat says there's my problem
4020880	4022880	I don't know if I should buy black or white
4022880	4024880	Or wait for
4024880	4026880	Gray since it's inevitable
4026880	4028880	There will be a third version as well
4028880	4030880	It's like they have this stuff down to a
4030880	4032880	Science now how to milk the most money out of you
4032880	4034880	Pokey fans
4034880	4036880	I don't know I guess I'll buy it if it's good
4036880	4038880	I'm tempted for some weird reason I can't even
4038880	4040880	Explain to buy that DS one just cause it seems
4040880	4042880	So freaking popular
4042880	4044880	But I'll just have to shake the walking trainer cause you know
4044880	4046880	See gray will come out
4046880	4048880	On the 3DS
4048880	4050880	Maybe you never know
4050880	4052880	Alright well let's stop talking about the new stuff
4052880	4056880	I'm gonna send it to pay some tribute to the old stuff
4056880	4058880	Every week here on the show
4058880	4060880	We like to take a look at gaming's past
4060880	4062880	And take a trip to the classic vault
4062880	4064880	And look at the classic video game
4064880	4066880	Of the week where Dark Soccer will pick one game
4066880	4068880	From the archives and she says you know what
4068880	4070880	You ungrateful kids
4070880	4072880	Playing with your Pokeymans all day and collecting your mudkips
4072880	4074880	You should take some time out
4074880	4076880	To pay tribute
4076880	4078880	To those that paved the way for these games
4078880	4080880	It's the classic game of the week Dark Soccer
4080880	4082880	For the kids tonight
4082880	4084880	The game I have chosen is Samurai Shodown 2
4086880	4088880	Samurai Shodown 2
4088880	4090880	I'm starting with the sequel
4092880	4094880	I love this series so much
4096880	4098880	The Japanese title is
4098880	4100880	Shin Samurai Spirits
4100880	4102880	Haomaru Jigokuen
4102880	4104880	So it translates to
4104880	4106880	True Samurai Spirits Haomaru's Portrait of Hell
4106880	4108880	It is a fighting game
4108880	4110880	It does the big in and out scrolling
4110880	4112880	Depending on how far everybody is across the screen
4112880	4114880	It also has a bunch of easter eggs in it
4114880	4116880	Which I think is absolutely fun
4116880	4118880	And has the pow meter
4118880	4120880	Ooh pow
4120880	4122880	I actually own this game
4122880	4124880	On Mio Geo
4124880	4126880	I have the cartridge
4126880	4128880	Well technically I have the Japanese cartridge
4128880	4130880	But you know you can actually switch
4130880	4132880	Your country of origin on it
4132880	4134880	And it changes your blood to sweat
4134880	4136880	And back and forth
4136880	4138880	Like this is from the Japanese version clearly
4140880	4142880	Cause there is blood everywhere
4142880	4144880	It's white sweat for the US one
4144880	4146880	But this one had
4146880	4148880	Some of the best characters in it
4148880	4150880	Actually like
4150880	4152880	I have to say three of my favorite characters
4152880	4154880	Came about in this game
4154880	4156880	Is uh
4156880	4158880	Kibagami Genjuro
4158880	4160880	Who was Haomaru's rival
4160880	4162880	Cham Cham who replaced Tam Tam
4162880	4164880	The little cat girl
4164880	4166880	And she was fun
4166880	4168880	She had like the giant boomerang
4168880	4170880	And I don't know that she has been in anything else
4170880	4172880	She was fantastic
4172880	4174880	We had Nihot Saiger
4174880	4176880	Who was the
4176880	4178880	Oppression knight with the huge mungus gauntlet
4178880	4180880	Another one I liked was
4180880	4182880	Kathy Nicotine
4182880	4184880	Who was this little monk
4184880	4186880	He was so fun
4186880	4188880	He could turn himself into a statue
4188880	4190880	Kuroko
4190880	4192880	Who was a hidden boss in the game
4192880	4194880	Who was actually the little guy that wears all black
4194880	4196880	That waves the flags
4196880	4198880	If anyone who doesn't really know
4198880	4200880	So much about
4200880	4202880	I would say
4202880	4204880	Japanese theater
4204880	4206880	Kuroko is like
4206880	4208880	A stage hand
4208880	4210880	The person who goes behind the scenes
4210880	4212880	Wears all black
4212880	4214880	He's supposed to be invisible
4214880	4216880	He'll be like a prop or something
4216880	4218880	Or change scenery
4218880	4220880	It's a cool music video
4220880	4222880	That uses all that
4222880	4224880	It's a sister sister's video
4224880	4226880	I can't remember what song it was
4226880	4228880	Except that he's not on a black screen
4228880	4230880	He's just a dude in black
4230880	4232880	Hanging out by the scenery
4232880	4234880	It's like what I would do in Rocky
4234880	4236880	Before I was the curtain
4236880	4238880	Right
4238880	4240880	Yeah, Rocky used to climb up on me
4240880	4242880	A couple of times
4242880	4244880	Let's not give the listeners the wrong impression
4244880	4246880	Of our friendship
4246880	4248880	No
4248880	4250880	There was also
4250880	4252880	A new
4252880	4254880	Female boss in the game
4254880	4256880	Um
4256880	4258880	Named
4258880	4260880	Rashojin Mizuki
4260880	4262880	Yeah, Amakusa was not female
4262880	4264880	Amakusa was just a girly dude
4264880	4266880	Um
4266880	4268880	You also
4268880	4270880	Had a blocking
4270880	4272880	And a parry technique
4272880	4274880	Um
4274880	4276880	Basically
4276880	4278880	You would, you know, push
4278880	4280880	Against sword to sword, you'd lock
4280880	4282880	And then whoever came across it
4282880	4284880	Could get in a hit that was unlockable
4284880	4286880	And they actually
4286880	4288880	Borrowed that for Street Fighter 3
4288880	4290880	Well, the kind of parry thing
4290880	4292880	The parry thing in Street Fighter 3 was different
4292880	4294880	Um
4294880	4296880	You, um
4296880	4298880	There were cameos from other SNK characters
4298880	4300880	And different stuff would happen
4300880	4302880	My favorite easter eggs though
4302880	4304880	A weird little move that you could do
4304880	4306880	With each of the characters
4306880	4308880	That would make them chibi
4308880	4310880	They'd just be little chibi, cutesy versions
4310880	4312880	They would just show up chibi
4312880	4314880	I did one by accident one time
4314880	4316880	And I was like, dude, that's kinda cool
4316880	4318880	Um
4318880	4320880	It actually, um
4320880	4322880	It was better received than the first one
4322880	4324880	And the first one, don't get me wrong, was great
4324880	4326880	But this one just took stuff that worked
4326880	4328880	And made it even better
4328880	4330880	It seriously, to me
4330880	4332880	It's one of my favorite games ever
4332880	4334880	It's up there, I'd put this up there
4334880	4336880	In the top ten, probably one of my favorite
4336880	4338880	Fighting games ever
4338880	4340880	Um
4340880	4342880	As far as versions that came out
4342880	4344880	Um
4344880	4346880	It only came out on Neo Geo
4346880	4348880	For like the longest time
4348880	4350880	Um
4350880	4352880	And then there was the Neo Geo CD version
4352880	4354880	Came out for Windows
4354880	4356880	And then
4356880	4358880	It actually, that version actually
4358880	4360880	Came out in the US
4360880	4362880	Um, there was a Playstation version that came out
4362880	4364880	In Samurai Spirit's Kenkaku Shinan Pack
4364880	4366880	Which, um, was the first two
4366880	4368880	And it only came out in Japan
4368880	4370880	And then the 2007 Tokyo Game Show
4370880	4372880	Um, there was an Xbox Live Arcade
4372880	4374880	And a PS2 Wii Anthology
4374880	4376880	Were announced
4376880	4378880	So
4378880	4380880	Um
4380880	4382880	It's
4382880	4384880	I, this is seriously
4384880	4386880	A fantastic game
4386880	4388880	It's one of, like I said, one of my favorites
4388880	4390880	And I think
4390880	4392880	Out of all of them, the only
4392880	4394880	Actually, no, I'd probably say that this one is my favorite
4394880	4396880	The only reason
4396880	4398880	That I would actually sometimes pick Samurai Spirit on three
4398880	4400880	Over two, sometimes
4400880	4402880	Is just to play as Rimuru
4402880	4404880	Cause she had the, um, the ice skin
4404880	4406880	Rimuru?
4408880	4410880	Bite Me Rob
4410880	4412880	That's her name, is Bite Me Rob
4412880	4414880	And then I'll go grab my cartridge in a second
4414880	4416880	That's it
4416880	4418880	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week
4418880	4420880	Samurai Showdown 2
4420880	4422880	Not one, not three, two
4422880	4424880	But you'll probably see one and three
4424880	4426880	In future weeks
4426880	4428880	When Jamie starts running out of games
4428880	4430880	Cause you've been doing this a while now, gosh
4430880	4432880	This is probably, like, the 100th game of the week
4432880	4434880	Rob, you've seen The Vault
4434880	4436880	I know
4436880	4438880	I've got a couple thousand games in there
4438880	4440880	I'm not going to run out
4440880	4442880	Alright
4442880	4444880	Well, he's scraping the obscure if you really want to get to it
4444880	4446880	What are you going to do when you run out of Sega?
4446880	4448880	I don't think I'm going to run out of Sega
4448880	4450880	Alright, we'll see
4450880	4452880	Alright, anyhow
4452880	4454880	For now though, we're going to take a quick break
4454880	4456880	But we'll come back, there's still plenty more to talk about tonight
4456880	4458880	You know, we haven't even touched the big iPhone news this week
4458880	4460880	And yes, it does affect gaming
4460880	4462880	We're going to talk some Red Dead Redemption
4462880	4464880	Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption
4464880	4466880	That's like Hammer Rimuru
4466880	4468880	And we're going to talk about
4468880	4470880	Some of the Microsoft changes to live
4470880	4472880	That are going to be kind of interesting
4472880	4474880	Especially for those of you that like to play games on the computer
4474880	4476880	Talk about a lot of that
4476880	4478880	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
4478880	4480880	So stick around, folks
4480880	4482880	We will be right back

4492880	4494880	We're going to be back in a few minutes
4494880	4496880	While we just take a second to rest our voices and so forth
4496880	4498880	With more of Orange Lounge Radio
4498880	4500880	We'll be right back
4504880	4506880	Welcome back everybody
4506880	4508880	To more of Orange Lounge Radio
4508880	4512880	On this Sunday night, April the 11th of 2010
4512880	4514880	We're joining you for our
4514880	4516880	362nd episode of the show
4516880	4518880	We're into Part B right now, the second half of our show
4518880	4520880	We have some rapid fire news coming up
4520880	4522880	And of course, Twitter topics
4522880	4524880	Just got a few more minutes to get those in
4524880	4526880	We already have quite a few though
4526880	4528880	If you want to ask us something on Twitter
4528880	4530880	And still some more news to get to
4530880	4532880	In tonight's program
4532880	4534880	Lots and lots of good stuff
4534880	4536880	Loki, why don't you kick it off with some rapid fire news
4536880	4538880	Yes, as it's been kind of a trend lately
4538880	4540880	There's been a lot of good games
4540880	4542880	Coming to the Xbox
4542880	4544880	Indie game service
4544880	4546880	And actually
4546880	4548880	Kind of not a stranger to
4548880	4550880	Doing some of these smaller
4550880	4552880	Indie games out there, Gameloft
4552880	4554880	They have decided to put a game on there called
4554880	4556880	Tank Battles
4556880	4558880	Actually it's pretty sweet
4558880	4560880	Kind of a high quality
4560880	4562880	Tank battling game
4562880	4564880	Almost like a souped up combat
4564880	4566880	If you will
4566880	4568880	And apparently it's kind of a port of
4568880	4570880	I want to say it's going to be a mobile game as well
4570880	4572880	And
4572880	4574880	Actually apparently it's been
4574880	4576880	Released last year on the Playstation
4576880	4578880	Network as Battle Tanks
4578880	4580880	Not sure why it hasn't been brought to
4580880	4582880	Xbox Live Arcade
4582880	4584880	Hey that's kind of cool anyways
4584880	4586880	How many of those games from the
4586880	4588880	Indie games have crossed over to regular
4588880	4590880	Xbox Live, hasn't there been like one?
4590880	4592880	Uh
4592880	4594880	Weren't they saying some time ago
4594880	4596880	That either there were going to be more that would cross over
4596880	4598880	To actual games or am I just
4598880	4600880	Making stuff up?
4600880	4602880	They do like a contest I want to say each year
4602880	4604880	And there's some that come out of that
4604880	4606880	But
4606880	4608880	Well no, they do a
4608880	4610880	Contest once a year
4610880	4612880	And they rarely port just one game from that
4612880	4614880	Um
4614880	4616880	But
4616880	4618880	I don't see a lot of them coming over the Xbox Live Arcade
4618880	4620880	But I don't really think it needs to because
4620880	4622880	Especially the ones that do win the
4622880	4624880	Contest they do get singled out
4624880	4626880	You can select I think
4626880	4628880	Contest winners or
4628880	4630880	Competition winners or whatever and you can actually see those
4630880	4632880	And then also of course now
4632880	4634880	With the new rating system and stuff
4634880	4636880	Um
4636880	4638880	It allows games that are actually pretty good
4638880	4640880	To make it to the forefront so people can sort through
4640880	4642880	All the hundreds of games that are on there
4642880	4644880	So um
4644880	4646880	It's not
4646880	4648880	Horrible, I don't know, it's getting better
4648880	4650880	That's for sure
4650880	4652880	Lots more games are coming out on there
4652880	4654880	Um
4654880	4656880	Now one game that we of course are not going to
4656880	4658880	Probably see on Indie games but
4658880	4660880	Perhaps an Xbox Live Arcade release
4660880	4662880	Or maybe something on the Playstation network
4662880	4664880	Who knows, um, Rocket Knight
4664880	4666880	Another game coming out
4666880	4668880	Of course you may remember Rocket Knight
4668880	4670880	I believe was an old Konami franchise
4670880	4672880	And um
4672880	4674880	Apparently this is going to be coming out soon
4674880	4676880	Um
4676880	4678880	Actually I believe in May
4678880	4680880	Which is pretty awesome
4680880	4682880	Not a series I can
4682880	4684880	Say I remember, maybe if I saw screenshots
4684880	4686880	It was um
4686880	4688880	I don't know if
4688880	4690880	It was like a 2D action game
4690880	4692880	And it will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade
4692880	4694880	PlayStation Network and Steam
4694880	4696880	And it was um, originally a 16 bit game
4696880	4698880	I want to see what was on like the
4698880	4700880	Super Nintendo
4700880	4702880	I don't know
4702880	4704880	But uh, yeah I don't know if the screen should
4704880	4706880	It's kind of souped up looking
4706880	4708880	So obviously the screenshots probably don't
4708880	4710880	Bring back any memories of the original game
4710880	4712880	But uh, looks neat
4712880	4714880	Alright, so that'll be coming out
4714880	4716880	Um
4716880	4718880	And then finally
4718880	4720880	Another Xbox Live Arcade game
4720880	4722880	Uh
4722880	4724880	And also going to be coming on Steam as well
4724880	4726880	Uh, Serious Sam HD
4726880	4728880	The second encounter is of course
4728880	4730880	Getting its um
4730880	4732880	Brand new HD remake I guess
4732880	4734880	And uh, should be coming
4734880	4736880	To Xbox Live soon
4736880	4738880	Um
4738880	4740880	They haven't really made an official date yet for
4740880	4742880	Xbox Live Arcade, but the Steam version is
4742880	4744880	Supposed to be coming out around
4744880	4746880	April 28th
4746880	4748880	And of course the PC version
4748880	4750880	On Steam will be available for
4750880	4752880	$17.99
4752880	4754880	And uh, I guess that'll be
4754880	4756880	If you pre-order it, otherwise
4756880	4758880	It's going to be $20
4758880	4760880	No word on exactly what it's going to cost of course
4760880	4762880	On um
4762880	4764880	Xbox Live Arcade, but probably somewhere around that
4764880	4766880	I mean $15
4766880	4768880	By the way, Rama in our chat room is clarifying
4768880	4770880	Just in case you didn't know, Rocket Knight Adventures
4770880	4772880	Was on the Sega Genesis
4772880	4774880	And the sequel Sparkster was on the
4774880	4776880	Super Nintendo and Genesis
4776880	4778880	So Sparkster was the original sequel
4778880	4780880	There you go
4780880	4782880	Alright, um, I got some other rapid
4782880	4784880	Quick stories for you guys
4784880	4786880	Couple items around Rock Band
4786880	4788880	Of course the weekly Rock Band releases
4788880	4790880	The songs that are coming out on Rock Band this week
4790880	4792880	Either on the 13th or the 15th
4792880	4794880	Depending on what system you're on
4794880	4796880	The Used will be releasing
4796880	4798880	The songs Blood on My Hands, Born to Quit
4798880	4800880	And The Taste of Ink
4800880	4802880	And some individual tracks from Surge Tunkian
4802880	4804880	Empty Walls and Sky is Over
4804880	4806880	As well as All Star
4806880	4808880	By Smash Mouth
4808880	4810880	If you haven't heard that song
4810880	4812880	500 times in 1999
4812880	4814880	You can hear it all over again
4814880	4816880	Speaking of 90's terrific things
4816880	4818880	Green Day is coming out
4818880	4820880	Of course with their own version of Rock Band
4820880	4822880	I did take a look at it a little bit
4822880	4824880	At PAX East, I didn't get to play it
4824880	4826880	But I saw other people playing it
4826880	4828880	And it definitely looked like the Beatles engine
4828880	4830880	But now they've replaced the Beatles with
4830880	4832880	You know, the punk guys of Green Day
4832880	4834880	So, you know, and giving it its own little spice
4834880	4836880	Obviously, the songs that will be in the game
4836880	4838880	I'm not gonna name them all, but I will just say
4838880	4840880	It almost looks like most of the
4840880	4842880	Dookie album, American Idiot
4842880	4844880	And 21st Century
4844880	4846880	Breakdown, almost like all those
4846880	4848880	Albums seem to be there, I mean there are some tracks missing
4848880	4850880	But big, big components of those albums
4850880	4852880	Otherwise, from
4852880	4854880	Warning, there's Minority and Warning
4854880	4856880	Nimrod has Hitchin' a Ride, Good Riddance, Time of Your Life
4856880	4858880	You know, when you need that slow jam
4858880	4860880	That quintessential goodbye song
4860880	4862880	Nice Guys Finish Last, then Insomniac has
4862880	4864880	Brain Stew, Jaded, and Geek Stink Breath
4864880	4866880	Geek Stink Breath
4866880	4868880	Downloadable content includes 21
4868880	4870880	Guns, and so forth
4870880	4872880	A few songs there
4872880	4874880	And then lastly for you guys, Squeenix
4874880	4876880	Has some Final Fantasy XIV updates this week
4876880	4878880	Including some of the races and clan
4878880	4880880	Information
4880880	4882880	Basically, your races can boil down into these
4882880	4884880	Different clans, so
4884880	4886880	You can play one of the not-Galka
4886880	4888880	But they're actually called Rogadins now
4888880	4890880	You can actually be like a
4890880	4892880	Sea Wolf Fisherman type of
4892880	4894880	Galka, I keep on calling them Galkas
4894880	4896880	But I guess they're Rogadins now
4896880	4898880	Or you can be like a fire type
4898880	4900880	Hellsguard clan, so it's like all the
4900880	4902880	Races now have clans too
4902880	4904880	So you have like a specialized sort of
4904880	4906880	Place that your race comes from
4906880	4908880	Well I'm glad they actually changed something other than the names
4908880	4910880	Well here's the other big thing is that
4910880	4912880	Some more information came out that's out there on the internet
4912880	4914880	And your characters have like first and
4914880	4916880	Last names now
4916880	4918880	A lot of instances play into
4918880	4920880	The game apparently
4920880	4922880	Where you get a lot of your own copy of the world
4922880	4924880	Dude, the game is sounding more and more like
4924880	4926880	Final Fantasy XI meets not Warcraft
4926880	4928880	But Guild Wars
4928880	4930880	Like I seriously think the game that they're making
4930880	4932880	Is like Final Fantasy XIV Guild Wars
4932880	4934880	Okay, that sounds playable
4934880	4936880	Just make it so I don't have to pay an online fee
4936880	4938880	Like Guild Wars and I'm there
4938880	4940880	Sadly I don't think that part, but there's screens from the alpha
4940880	4942880	That are leaking out there now and you can see
4942880	4944880	I'll have to show you the website here in Studio Loki
4944880	4946880	And Jamie if you want to see it too
4946880	4948880	Because your items are on like
4948880	4950880	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, like you push the button
4950880	4952880	To do the attack now
4952880	4954880	Like it's a little more wow-ish
4954880	4956880	Or Guild Wars was kind of the same way
4956880	4958880	So very curious to see how this plays out
4958880	4962880	Well as long as I can do it with a controller
4962880	4964880	Because I kind of miss playing with a controller
4964880	4966880	Well if they're developing it for PS3
4966880	4968880	Then I'm sure controller will be
4968880	4970880	I mean but it'll be weird because I don't know if you'll be able to
4970880	4972880	Put in just any old controller or what you'll have to do
4972880	4974880	Break out the old gravis pad, do it the old school way
4974880	4976880	It should be fine
4976880	4978880	We'll see what happens, more to come
4978880	4980880	When the beta for that is released
4980880	4982880	But meanwhile we just have stuff leaking out from the alpha
4982880	4984880	So I'll show you, while Jamie does her quick stories here
4984880	4986880	I'll pull up that website
4986880	4988880	That somebody texted me here in Studio
4988880	4990880	And show you guys the screenshots
4990880	4992880	And I'll post it in chat if anyone actually cares
4992880	4994880	Well some kid
4994880	4998880	Who is on Facebook
4998880	5000880	Plays Farmville
5000880	5002880	And used
5002880	5004880	Their parent's
5004880	5006880	Credit card to run up a
5006880	5008880	905 pound tab
5008880	5010880	Basically
5010880	5012880	About $13-1400
5012880	5014880	To
5014880	5016880	Pay for stuff
5016880	5018880	I guess he took his
5018880	5020880	Mother's credit card and put it in
5020880	5022880	And
5022880	5024880	Spent all that money
5024880	5026880	So they're trying to figure something out on it
5026880	5028880	I guess, I just think
5028880	5030880	I hate Farmville anyway
5030880	5032880	It's a waste of time
5032880	5034880	I know people like it, they want to do it fine
5034880	5036880	But if you got kids that play it, watch out for your
5036880	5038880	Credit card
5038880	5040880	Can I just interject something real quick
5040880	5042880	I know you don't watch a lot of TV
5042880	5044880	But this week South Park was awesome
5044880	5046880	Because they made fun of
5046880	5048880	Oh here's the screenshots of 14 by the way
5048880	5050880	You can kind of see with the little stuff at the bottom
5050880	5052880	Yeah it's very pretty looking
5052880	5054880	The Vulture 8 is dead ass up
5054880	5056880	You can see there
5056880	5058880	Just some people running around the world
5058880	5060880	It looks very pretty
5060880	5062880	South Park did a Facebook
5062880	5064880	Related episode this week and it was hilarious
5064880	5066880	But it was Facebook
5066880	5068880	For the first half and then it was Tron for the second half
5068880	5070880	Yeah I need to watch that one
5070880	5072880	It was pretty fucking funny I gotta say
5072880	5074880	So was it Face Tron?
5074880	5076880	Well it was one of those things where I gotta be honest
5076880	5078880	A lot of episodes of South Park have been like this lately
5078880	5080880	The first 15 minutes are
5080880	5082880	Really fucking funny when they're parodying
5082880	5084880	Something and they're doing it well
5084880	5086880	And then they decide to go this really like
5086880	5088880	ETF lol BBQ direction
5088880	5090880	For the last 15 minutes
5090880	5092880	That doesn't work so much
5092880	5094880	Like that's been kind of a pattern of South Park lately
5094880	5096880	Like the first 15 minutes are hilarious
5096880	5098880	And the second 15 minutes are not nearly as funny
5098880	5100880	And that's kind of sadly the Tron part
5100880	5102880	Not as funny as the rest of it
5102880	5104880	But I thought it was awesome they referenced it
5104880	5106880	I love Tron though
5106880	5108880	Namco Bandai is doing something really
5108880	5110880	Neat
5110880	5112880	We're getting Splatterhouse on
5112880	5114880	I guess they're doing
5114880	5116880	They're doing a new game
5116880	5118880	They got delayed and delayed
5118880	5120880	I was saying that
5120880	5122880	Sorry
5122880	5124880	Okay
5124880	5126880	As I was trying to say
5126880	5128880	They're doing a new Splatterhouse
5128880	5130880	And they're gonna put the original
5130880	5132880	Trilogy on
5132880	5134880	The disc
5134880	5136880	I guess this is a little fun compilation
5136880	5138880	To add on to that
5138880	5140880	It will have the original
5140880	5142880	Arcade version of Splatterhouse
5142880	5144880	As in the uncensored one
5144880	5146880	And then Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3
5146880	5148880	That were the Genesis versions
5148880	5150880	So
5150880	5152880	That'll be pretty fun
5152880	5154880	Was this Herpographics one censored as well?
5154880	5156880	Cause I remember that being pretty
5156880	5158880	I have it but I haven't
5158880	5160880	Played it in so long that
5160880	5162880	I'd have to break it out and see
5162880	5164880	I don't recall it
5164880	5166880	Really being that censored
5166880	5168880	Really
5168880	5170880	And then
5170880	5172880	And then we have
5172880	5174880	For Xbox Live in April
5174880	5176880	Final Fight and Mega Man 10
5176880	5178880	Download Content
5178880	5180880	Basically
5180880	5182880	It's Final Fight Double Impact
5182880	5184880	And
5184880	5186880	That's gonna be on April 14th
5186880	5188880	And then
5188880	5190880	There will be
5190880	5192880	The Mall half-priced
5192880	5194880	On April 12th
5194880	5196880	And then two add-ons for Mega Man 10
5196880	5198880	Which is Base and Special Stage 1
5198880	5200880	Also known as Forte
5200880	5202880	Final Fight Double Impact
5202880	5204880	Next week
5204880	5206880	Or as I call it, Magic Sword
5206880	5208880	And some other little game
5208880	5210880	That I remember from a pizza parlor
5210880	5212880	I know I'm excited
5212880	5214880	There was no Xbox Live Arcade release this week
5214880	5216880	I don't think there was
5216880	5218880	And they tend to do that after their big huge
5218880	5220880	Promotions, then they go
5220880	5222880	Oh we just had this awesome promotion
5222880	5224880	And some old games on sale
5224880	5226880	But we just want to overlook that we have no new game this week
5226880	5228880	There's no new game this week
5228880	5230880	Because they're too busy shutting down
5230880	5232880	Xbox service
5232880	5234880	On April 15th
5234880	5236880	It's gone, it's out there
5236880	5238880	So get your taxes done
5238880	5240880	And get your last Halo 2 game in
5240880	5242880	Unless you're gonna play on PC from here on out
5242880	5244880	I hope we get a patch so we get our 100 plus friends now
5244880	5246880	It's weird though
5246880	5248880	Because they already had the big patch
5248880	5250880	For the USB support
5250880	5252880	This past week
5252880	5254880	I don't know if you heard
5254880	5256880	We were talking about it, I don't think we are
5256880	5258880	But you heard that uncrippled the hard drive
5258880	5260880	Set of consoles that got banned
5260880	5262880	Oh?
5262880	5264880	Yes, that patch did
5264880	5266880	Interesting, yeah I think that is interesting
5266880	5268880	Alright, I wanted to quickly
5268880	5270880	Answer some questions from chat
5270880	5272880	chat.orangewiseontraday.com
5272880	5274880	Frisbee's asking in reference to the South Park episode
5274880	5276880	What did you think about the chat roulette part?
5276880	5278880	Oh I forgot that they make chat roulette
5278880	5280880	I didn't even realize that was a real site
5280880	5282880	I actually had the check that I was like, holy crap that's a real site
5282880	5284880	The only way that I know that's a real site
5284880	5286880	Is that I've seen the YouTube of the guy
5286880	5288880	Well I've seen a couple YouTubes
5288880	5290880	The guy that does the piano
5290880	5292880	And starts singing the random songs
5292880	5294880	To the guys that come up on there
5294880	5296880	Which is really funny
5296880	5298880	And then there was a guy who dressed up like Lady Gaga
5298880	5300880	And did lip syncs
5300880	5302880	But he was like a really hairy guy
5302880	5304880	So it was really funny because it was obviously not a woman
5304880	5306880	And just all the people reacting to him
5306880	5308880	Was kind of funny
5308880	5310880	But yeah, you're not gonna catch me
5310880	5312880	I will die before I will go on chat roulette
5312880	5314880	Like I've never been to the website
5314880	5316880	Penis, penis, penis, penis
5316880	5318880	I thought it was funny but it was kind of one of those things
5318880	5320880	Where the joke got old
5320880	5322880	And then they kept saying it like over and over again
5322880	5324880	For like another three minutes
5324880	5326880	And I was like, okay, I'm over it
5326880	5328880	But yeah, chat roulette, not a site
5328880	5330880	I mean god, I'm barely on AIM and Skype
5330880	5332880	Why would I go on chat roulette and talk to strangers
5332880	5334880	I can't even talk to my friends online
5334880	5336880	I'm not gonna go on chat roulette
5336880	5338880	Alright let's get to some Twitter topics
5338880	5340880	Every week we let you guys ask questions on Twitter
5340880	5342880	It seems like every podcast does this now
5342880	5344880	I don't know, like I've been listening to more podcasts
5344880	5346880	Everybody has a damn Twitter segment now
5346880	5348880	I'd like to think we were one of the first
5348880	5350880	It's like we were one of the first Skype shows
5352880	5354880	But whatever
5354880	5356880	It's awesome because it's our listeners
5356880	5358880	And they ask some crazy asked questions sometimes
5358880	5360880	And share some stories with us
5360880	5362880	That we might otherwise miss on the show
5362880	5364880	That's the other very important thing
5364880	5366880	Retertainment asks, games to play while drunk
5366880	5368880	Games to play while drunk
5368880	5370880	And go
5370880	5372880	I'd play DDR drunk
5372880	5374880	Rock band if Jamie's party yesterday
5374880	5376880	Was any indication
5376880	5378880	I wasn't really drunk
5378880	5380880	You weren't drunk
5380880	5382880	Yeah any type of karaoke game
5382880	5384880	Is always funnier when drunk
5384880	5386880	Why are you aware of the Wii
5386880	5388880	I think a lot of Wii games
5388880	5390880	Are kind of funnier when you're drunk
5390880	5392880	But just be careful
5392880	5394880	There's a difference between funny and hurting yourself
5394880	5396880	That goddamn unicorn game
5396880	5398880	That Loki always fucking plays during the show
5398880	5400880	I'm sure is better when you're drunk
5400880	5402880	He's playing right now
5402880	5404880	Robot unicorn attack, there you go
5404880	5406880	Agdeft says Konami is distributing
5406880	5408880	Latin American made game
5408880	5410880	Lucha Libre AAA Heroes Del Ring
5410880	5412880	In America
5412880	5414880	Ironically it's not coming out in Mexico
5418880	5420880	I don't know, maybe another developer is putting it out there
5420880	5422880	I don't know, but if you like your
5422880	5424880	Mexican wrestling, which it is kind of a niche thing
5424880	5426880	But it's pretty cool
5426880	5428880	Yeah and it's actual stars of AAA wrestling
5428880	5430880	El Eligido
5430880	5432880	Abismo Negro Psycho Clown
5432880	5434880	Electroshock, and Charlie Manson
5434880	5436880	There's a wrestler named Charlie Manson
5436880	5438880	That's a little close to a certain
5438880	5440880	Serial killer
5440880	5442880	So there you go
5442880	5444880	You might remember Konami
5444880	5446880	This isn't the first time they put out wrestling games
5446880	5448880	Oh no, they had Rumble Roses
5448880	5450880	Remember Rumble Roses?
5450880	5452880	What's your favorite Xbox game?
5452880	5454880	I wanted to play that actually, it's a game that Dan would never pick up
5454880	5456880	But I really wanted to play it
5456880	5458880	You could probably get it now for like $3
5458880	5460880	I think I saw Dead or Alive Volleyball
5460880	5462880	Or whatever for like $10 the other day
5462880	5464880	Hey, that was fun
5464880	5466880	There's a game to play when drunk
5466880	5468880	We've got to
5468880	5470880	And yes, I've watched Dan play it while I was drunk
5470880	5472880	Portal Drunk, instant throw up
5472880	5474880	SSJ100Matt on his Twitter account says
5474880	5476880	Not so much a story, but a question for Loki
5476880	5478880	Are you paying attention Loki?
5478880	5480880	He's playing the unicorn farting game
5480880	5482880	Well he just crashed the unicorn, so here we go
5482880	5484880	What's your opinion on the kid that was caught
5484880	5486880	Trying to steal the game Breach at PAX East?
5486880	5488880	Well it was a good attempt I guess
5488880	5490880	But he got caught
5490880	5492880	Don't compliment him
5492880	5494880	Nice try kid
5494880	5496880	He doesn't deserve a compliment
5496880	5498880	It was a stupid asshole thing to do
5498880	5500880	Yeah, well his reasons were retarded
5500880	5502880	It's like, I just want to play this with my friend
5502880	5504880	Well
5504880	5506880	No, you wanted to brag that you had the game
5506880	5508880	Is what you wanted to do
5508880	5510880	And unfortunately you're stupid and you got caught
5510880	5512880	So now you're going to face fines and jail time
5512880	5514880	And all that stuff
5514880	5516880	Hope it was worth it
5516880	5518880	I'm going to say he probably shouldn't have done it in the first place
5518880	5520880	Just taking a lucky stab in the dark
5520880	5522880	Well he shouldn't have, but you know
5522880	5524880	He wanted to make a name for himself
5524880	5526880	It's kind of surprising that he had the balls to do it
5526880	5528880	And then not show up to his court date
5528880	5530880	That was pretty fun
5530880	5532880	Hilarious
5532880	5534880	He was too busy playing on Chat Roulette
5534880	5536880	No, he was playing Modern Warfare 2
5536880	5538880	Was he really?
5540880	5542880	Spazinator, a PSN on Twitter
5542880	5544880	Actually tells us
5544880	5546880	Samurai Shodown 2 was also on Xbox Live Arcade
5546880	5548880	It was released there last year
5548880	5550880	That's right
5550880	5552880	I don't remember if Jamie said it
5552880	5554880	Sometimes people tweet us while she's doing that
5554880	5556880	Yeah, I remember
5556880	5558880	I played it for a little bit, but I got to admit
5558880	5560880	I was not as big on Samurai Shodown
5560880	5562880	I was talking about Samurai Shodown 2
5562880	5564880	The one that was released on Xbox Live Arcade
5564880	5566880	But that was not the series
5566880	5568880	I was really as into on Neo Geo
5568880	5570880	I was more of a Fatal Fury person
5570880	5572880	I have Fatal Fury Special
5572880	5574880	Then after that
5574880	5576880	I would go with Art of Fighting
5576880	5578880	Then maybe Samurai Shodown
5578880	5580880	Because I like Katori Hanzo
5580880	5582880	ActDeft says DJ Hero's price
5582880	5584880	is now down to $50 at Toys R Us
5584880	5586880	and links us to a new story about the price reduction
5586880	5588880	Not surprised
5588880	5590880	That didn't move as well as they did
5590880	5592880	Now would be a good time to pick that up
5592880	5594880	for DJ Hero 2
5594880	5596880	If you want to get the controller
5596880	5598880	and have it for DJ Hero 2
5598880	5600880	They also have, if you really want to spend the money
5600880	5602880	They have these new bundles now that have two
5602880	5604880	DJ Hero controllers with the game
5604880	5606880	It's a good game
5606880	5608880	It's a bummer they didn't support the download content better
5608880	5610880	Because they could have done better
5610880	5612880	I'll pick up the sequel
5612880	5614880	Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome game
5614880	5616880	It's just typical
5616880	5618880	of Activision and their support
5618880	5620880	for the download content
5620880	5622880	If you've seen what they do for the Guitar Hero series
5622880	5624880	It's not a big surprise that we only have
5624880	5626880	three pieces of download content
5626880	5628880	Dark Tetsuya says
5628880	5630880	I just realized we haven't heard from the ferret in a while
5630880	5632880	What ever happened to him?
5632880	5634880	When we moved the show to Studio Dark Sakura
5634880	5636880	The ferret didn't really come with us
5636880	5638880	I found it while moving
5638880	5640880	So the ferret is at my place right now
5640880	5642880	Don't forget we have other mascots here
5642880	5644880	We have that stupid Dalek
5644880	5646880	That I don't think is funny at all
5646880	5648880	We also have Shirmi
5648880	5650880	Who makes a pretty awesome mascot
5650880	5652880	Remember, Shirmi shit on the floor
5652880	5654880	When we were talking about that PlayStation show The Tester
5654880	5656880	Well good, I'm glad
5656880	5658880	But that was her opinion, she was critiquing
5658880	5660880	Wait wait wait
5666880	5668880	Ferret was, oh god my ears
5668880	5670880	Ferret was better
5670880	5672880	Ferret or Dalek?
5672880	5674880	I say ferret
5674880	5676880	Ray Ayanami says
5676880	5678880	No I'm sorry I skipped one
5678880	5680880	Spaznator also sent, usually I don't do two tweets
5680880	5682880	But I will allow it tonight
5682880	5684880	Rob you asked about a month ago if I seen The Tester
5684880	5686880	Finally seen it, I have similar thoughts on it
5686880	5688880	You know I stopped watching it
5688880	5690880	I heard it ended finally
5690880	5692880	And I'm pretty sure
5692880	5694880	Season 1 ended
5694880	5696880	Oh god are they doing another one?
5696880	5698880	Well anyhow I'm pretty sure the person I thought
5698880	5700880	Was gonna win won
5700880	5702880	You know I would go on season 2 of The Tester
5702880	5704880	Why not?
5704880	5706880	I mean they probably tape it over a weekend
5706880	5708880	And you get $5,000 for winning
5708880	5710880	I mean I probably wouldn't keep the job
5710880	5712880	But I'd like to have the $5,000
5712880	5714880	That'd be pretty awesome
5714880	5716880	It might be a fame whore, why not?
5716880	5718880	That even won The Tester, what do you think?
5718880	5720880	Go Xbox
5720880	5722880	I don't know, I quit
5722880	5724880	Might be fun for the experience
5724880	5726880	It sucks, I don't wanna play Ipet
5726880	5728880	Alright Ray Ayanami says
5728880	5730880	Oh whoops that was a personal tweet here
5730880	5732880	Just it had at o-l-r in it here
5732880	5734880	Shadow Sniper says your thoughts on Hitman 5
5734880	5736880	And what you would like to see in the new game
5736880	5738880	There's a Hitman 5?
5738880	5740880	I didn't even know there was a Hitman 5 coming out
5740880	5742880	I didn't play Hitman 1 through 4
5742880	5744880	It's not really my type of game, Loki that's more of your alley
5744880	5746880	No, it's a stealth
5746880	5748880	Action game so that's not really
5748880	5750880	My forte
5750880	5752880	What would I like to see in the new game? Lots of sex and violence
5752880	5754880	That always makes for a great video game, right?
5754880	5756880	Not Timothy Orphan, whatever his name is
5756880	5758880	Yes and more lesbians
5758880	5760880	Tigerclaw305
5760880	5762880	Tweet says
5762880	5764880	GTA is being shown to school children to teach them
5764880	5766880	About violence and links us to this
5766880	5768880	News story here from vg247.com
5768880	5770880	That
5770880	5772880	Apparently great school children
5772880	5774880	Are shown imagery from Grand Theft Auto
5774880	5776880	It's in the UK
5776880	5778880	And they're showing it to children between 9 and 11
5778880	5780880	And they're trying to keep them from being
5780880	5782880	Desensitized to violent behavior
5782880	5784880	And teach them consequences
5784880	5786880	By the way they also show them
5786880	5788880	The Itchy and Scratchy show from the Simpsons
5788880	5790880	What?
5790880	5792880	Like I had to check to make sure this wasn't dated April 1st
5792880	5794880	What?
5794880	5796880	Fight, and fight, and fight, and fight, and fight
5796880	5798880	Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
5798880	5800880	Just a guess but
5800880	5802880	I don't think you show people violence to get them
5802880	5804880	Not desensitized to violence
5804880	5806880	That kind of
5806880	5808880	Is, you know, the opposite of what you want to do
5808880	5810880	You know what they did when I was young to scare the shit out of me
5810880	5812880	And this wasn't necessarily about violence
5812880	5814880	But it was violent
5814880	5816880	And it was about the responsibility of having a driver's license
5816880	5818880	Is they'd show us red asphalt
5818880	5820880	Oh we laughed through that
5820880	5822880	That's, you're not supposed to laugh
5822880	5824880	It's disgusting
5824880	5826880	I actually don't think I've ever seen red asphalt
5826880	5828880	I would like not watch it
5828880	5830880	Like I just would kind of look away and not really watch it
5830880	5832880	It was disgusting
5832880	5834880	Remember that every 15 minutes, you know, they'll teach you about drunk driving
5834880	5836880	I'm like, you're wasting so much time
5836880	5838880	I don't care
5838880	5840880	I get it
5840880	5842880	This person had alcohol
5842880	5844880	This is a drunk driving accident
5844880	5846880	It's sad, it happens
5846880	5848880	Why do I have to sit here for two hours while you talk about it?
5848880	5850880	They didn't do that at my school
5850880	5852880	Did they actually drink?
5852880	5854880	No they didn't, here's what they did
5854880	5856880	This is great
5856880	5858880	And this is from how I understand that they did it
5858880	5860880	It could be a little different
5860880	5862880	Okay, first they came out on our
5862880	5864880	You know, our football field
5864880	5866880	Because we had our stadium and whatever
5866880	5868880	They had everybody sit there and they had this
5868880	5870880	Big thing covered up with a tarp or something
5870880	5872880	So they pulled the tarp off
5872880	5874880	And it's this horrible car accident
5874880	5876880	Like this person mangled or whatever
5876880	5878880	Of course it's just a person with makeup on and whatnot
5878880	5880880	And then an ambulance comes
5880880	5882880	And they realistically
5882880	5884880	Pull them out of the wreckage and stuff like that
5884880	5886880	And then
5886880	5888880	Later on
5888880	5890880	Was it like one of the students?
5890880	5892880	Yeah, it was one of the students
5892880	5894880	It was somebody, animal
5894880	5896880	And then later on they had this grim reaper
5896880	5898880	Walking around the entire day
5898880	5900880	And in 15 minutes they would take a student
5900880	5902880	And pull them out of class
5902880	5904880	And they were basically dead
5904880	5906880	And they wouldn't be there for the rest of the week
5906880	5908880	Or however long it was
5908880	5910880	You had to get out of school for a week?
5910880	5912880	Okay, but no
5912880	5914880	It's like punishment basically
5914880	5916880	And I don't know if
5916880	5918880	Wait, punishment?
5918880	5920880	What did you do to get the grim reaper to tap you?
5920880	5922880	Oh, Matt didn't do his homework, you come with me
5922880	5924880	Kid
5924880	5926880	You're a drunk driver
5926880	5928880	This is entirely accurate because
5928880	5930880	It's really fucked up if it is
5930880	5932880	Um, basically they took
5932880	5934880	Them to like some sort of location
5934880	5936880	A cabin or whatever
5936880	5938880	And made them write notes to their parents or something like that
5938880	5940880	About like
5940880	5942880	Dear mom, I am dead
5942880	5944880	I died at school today
5944880	5946880	Hello dad, I'm in hell!
5946880	5948880	Basically they said that they told their parents that they died
5948880	5950880	Or something like that
5950880	5952880	That's a horrible thing to do to your parents
5952880	5954880	Can you imagine if I wrote
5954880	5956880	I had to write a letter to my mom
5956880	5958880	Hi mom, I died at school today
5958880	5960880	The grim reaper took me out of class because I drank a drug
5960880	5962880	They didn't
5962880	5964880	They wrote letters to their parents later on
5964880	5966880	About stuff like that
5966880	5968880	Apparently the impression I was under
5968880	5970880	Is that the
5970880	5972880	The police went to their house
5972880	5974880	And told their parents that they were dead
5974880	5976880	You know
5976880	5978880	Shouldn't they be out trying to catch
5978880	5980880	Real drunk drivers?
5980880	5982880	Anyways, you know what they did at my school?
5982880	5984880	They would have the really mean, fugly PE teacher
5984880	5986880	Come in and say
5986880	5988880	If you drink and drive
5988880	5990880	You're gonna go to jail
5990880	5992880	And you're gonna stay there forever
5992880	5994880	And you're gonna have a criminal record
5994880	5996880	And if you drink and drive, you're an idiot
5996880	5998880	It took five minutes
5998880	6000880	I understand that and that makes perfect sense
6000880	6002880	Not only did we have to sit through this two hour long
6002880	6004880	You know
6004880	6006880	Accident thing
6006880	6008880	And them talking about
6008880	6010880	Every fifteen minutes and stuff
6010880	6012880	For another assembly
6012880	6014880	Where these people were crying
6014880	6016880	Their parents were crying, I thought Billy was dead
6016880	6018880	And all this stuff
6018880	6020880	It was annoying
6020880	6022880	So that's why I've learned about drunk driving
6022880	6024880	Is that it's absolutely annoying
6024880	6026880	The crap you have to deal with if you do it
6026880	6028880	So, don't do it
6028880	6030880	Because you'll get two assemblies that you'll have to sit through
6034880	6036880	No, but honestly though
6036880	6038880	I mean, duh
6038880	6040880	Drunk driving impairs you and you can die
6040880	6042880	Okay, or kill somebody
6042880	6044880	I mean, any sane person
6044880	6046880	That has some sort of common sense
6046880	6048880	Gets that
6048880	6050880	However, nowadays, kids are not being raised with common sense
6050880	6052880	So, it's no wonder that they have to have
6052880	6054880	Multiple assemblies
6054880	6056880	In order for this to sink in
6056880	6058880	And even then, it's just not going to
6058880	6060880	Well that's okay, I'm just gonna
6060880	6062880	Smoke pot instead
6062880	6064880	That's better
6064880	6066880	I'm not drinking and driving at all
6066880	6068880	Fuck you, Grim Reaper
6070880	6072880	What were we talking about before?
6072880	6074880	I don't remember
6074880	6076880	I was trying to see if they had that clip
6076880	6078880	That I remember from the 90s
6078880	6080880	That was, uh
6080880	6082880	Yeah, I think it's this
6082880	6084880	This was very much like what they did at my school
6084880	6086880	I think it's this clip
6086880	6088880	So, Beavis and Butthead
6088880	6090880	I understand Mr. McVicar has made
6090880	6092880	A little arrangement with you guys
6092880	6094880	Yeah, a little probation
6094880	6096880	You see, class Beavis and Butthead
6096880	6098880	Here are not allowed to laugh
6098880	6100880	For a whole week
6100880	6102880	That's right, and if they do laugh
6102880	6104880	They'll be expelled and they'll have to
6104880	6106880	Go to Hope High School where they'll get
6106880	6108880	Their asses kicked on a daily basis
6108880	6110880	By all the other delinquents
6110880	6112880	Yeah, okay, so
6112880	6114880	Well, I was real glad to hear that
6114880	6116880	Because this is Sex Education Week
6116880	6118880	Oh, here we go
6118880	6120880	That's right, Sex Ed Week
6120880	6122880	We're gonna be talking about the penis
6122880	6124880	We'll be talking about
6124880	6126880	The vagina
6126880	6128880	Do you think that's funny, Butthead?
6128880	6130880	Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking
6130880	6132880	About the testicles?
6132880	6134880	Yes, we're also gonna be talking
6134880	6136880	About venereal disease
6136880	6138880	Sexual intercourse
6138880	6140880	And we will definitely
6140880	6142880	Be spending a lot of time
6142880	6144880	Talking about masturbation
6144880	6146880	Laughing
6146880	6148880	Laughing
6148880	6150880	That's what they did at my school
6150880	6152880	See, this is the type of letter
6152880	6154880	Actually, that they had to write
6154880	6156880	For the every 15 minutes program
6156880	6158880	Dear Mom and Dad, every 15 minutes someone dies
6158880	6160880	As a result of an alcohol related collision
6160880	6162880	Today I died and I never got the chance
6162880	6164880	To tell you blah blah blah
6164880	6166880	And that's what made them all upset
6166880	6168880	It was annoying, trust me
6168880	6170880	If you go through high school
6170880	6172880	Just get the gym teacher in there for five minutes
6172880	6174880	Scare the hell out of everyone
6174880	6176880	Do you want to see me again?
6176880	6178880	Do you want to see me again?
6178880	6180880	We have some other tweets
6180880	6182880	MNZeba
6182880	6184880	Follows that with a question about Pokemon
6184880	6186880	RO
6186880	6188880	Plugging the old
6188880	6190880	Pokemon RO telling us
6190880	6192880	That you can actually win a beta account
6192880	6194880	Apparently they're doing a little thing there
6194880	6196880	But the thing they linked us to didn't work
6196880	6198880	But here's my thing
6198880	6200880	For some reason the link didn't work
6200880	6202880	But here's my question about Pokemon RO
6202880	6204880	Didn't one of these Pokemon operations get shut down recently?
6204880	6206880	Like there was a Pokemon MMO going on?
6206880	6208880	Like I'm just saying
6208880	6210880	I hope it doesn't get shut down
6210880	6212880	I wouldn't like to see that happen to this
6212880	6214880	But I'm just saying if Nintendo did the other one
6214880	6216880	Just be careful kids
6216880	6218880	I've seen some of the in-game stuff
6218880	6220880	That looks pretty
6220880	6222880	Ragnarok-y, pretty good
6222880	6224880	Alright anyhow
6224880	6226880	That's it for Twitter topics tonight
6226880	6228880	Thank you guys so much for the tweets
6228880	6230880	And sorry I didn't get to everything
6230880	6232880	Well we had to play the clip from Beavis and Butthead
6232880	6234880	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us in the future
6234880	6236880	Alright Giovedea in our chatroom says
6236880	6238880	I took a college class where we had to yell
6238880	6240880	tits, ass, penis, vagina, and all that
6240880	6242880	on the first day of class
6242880	6244880	Sex education in college is actually a lot of fun
6244880	6246880	And it's educational
6246880	6248880	So those of you kids that are about the college age
6248880	6250880	Just take it, it's fun
6250880	6252880	We actually had in our class
6252880	6254880	They brought a transsexual
6254880	6256880	person in one day
6256880	6258880	Not a transvestite
6258880	6260880	We actually had to learn the difference
6260880	6262880	Transvestite is someone who just dresses
6262880	6264880	for fun and you know for
6264880	6266880	whatever
6266880	6268880	And a transsexual is someone who believes they are
6268880	6270880	the other gender
6270880	6272880	and is the ones that actually get the operations
6272880	6274880	So they had a transsexual come in
6274880	6276880	Teacher shut the door and said, okay for the next hour you can ask
6276880	6278880	anything you want and this person has agreed to
6278880	6280880	answer any gross
6280880	6282880	curiosity, whatever you've ever wanted to know
6282880	6284880	now's time to ask it
6284880	6286880	So they asked everything
6286880	6288880	Everything
6288880	6290880	But it was a highly educational day, I'll tell you that
6290880	6292880	Our 6th
6292880	6294880	grade sex ed
6294880	6296880	was hilarious because they didn't really have
6296880	6298880	We had a female teacher so the female teacher
6298880	6300880	took the girls and explained the girls stuff
6300880	6302880	And then apparently
6302880	6304880	some kid's father
6304880	6306880	was the person we had
6306880	6308880	teaching the male portion of it and the guy
6308880	6310880	was a pervert
6310880	6312880	And that was funny
6312880	6314880	Yeah they used to split up the class for us too
6314880	6316880	And then the teacher found out
6316880	6318880	the guy was a pervert
6318880	6320880	And that was the end of sex ed
6320880	6322880	You guys might find this
6322880	6324880	funny but when I was in sex ed
6324880	6326880	You know what test I did
6326880	6328880	We had like 6 different tests throughout class
6328880	6330880	Do you know which test I got the lowest score on?
6330880	6332880	Out of all the tests that they gave out in class?
6332880	6334880	Male anatomy? No
6334880	6336880	Vagina week
6336880	6338880	You'd find that funny
6338880	6340880	I thought y'all would get a kick out of that
6340880	6342880	I find that ironic
6342880	6344880	Hey gaming
6344880	6346880	news once in a while
6346880	6348880	It happens
6348880	6350880	believe it or not we talk about
6350880	6352880	video game news on this program
6352880	6354880	Oh god what happened to this show
6354880	6356880	Loki?
6356880	6358880	So what's kind of neat is there's a rumor
6358880	6360880	that Microsoft's live support
6360880	6362880	is coming to the free games that you get
6362880	6364880	with Windows. Yes you may remember
6364880	6366880	all those wonderful classics as
6366880	6368880	Solitaire, Minesweeper,
6368880	6370880	Chess, etc. Some of these
6370880	6372880	I have never heard of I guess because I don't have
6372880	6374880	Windows 7 like Purple Place
6374880	6376880	Purple Place! Yeah it's one of the new
6376880	6378880	Windows 7 games
6378880	6380880	And Windows has Mahjong now?
6380880	6382880	Yep
6382880	6384880	It's on Vista
6384880	6386880	It's on Vista and 7
6386880	6388880	It's basically the old Shanghai game but
6388880	6390880	you know now Microsoft brand
6390880	6392880	So I wonder if
6392880	6394880	that means
6394880	6396880	apparently they're gonna not only get achievements
6396880	6398880	but chat and leaderboard support
6400880	6402880	So now I can chat with people
6402880	6404880	while playing Solitaire and have leaderboards
6404880	6406880	Wow
6406880	6408880	Interesting that they're gonna integrate this
6408880	6410880	Well you know Solitaire is a huge game
6410880	6412880	on Windows I mean it's probably the number
6412880	6414880	one Windows game above
6414880	6416880	anything else you can think of
6416880	6418880	WoW, Halo
6418880	6420880	anything you can think of
6420880	6422880	Solitaire is probably a bigger game then
6422880	6424880	Yeah
6424880	6426880	So I mean if you want to and probably Minesweeper
6426880	6428880	to some extent too so if you want to enable people
6428880	6430880	so to speak or get them on board early
6430880	6432880	I suppose this is the way to do it
6432880	6434880	It just seems, I don't know, a little weird
6434880	6436880	But that's gonna be kind of interesting if I can
6436880	6438880	further inflate my E-peen
6438880	6440880	score with the
6440880	6442880	you know
6442880	6444880	Should have been working now, achievement
6446880	6448880	Played Solitaire between
6448880	6450880	the hours of 8am and 5pm, achievement
6450880	6452880	unlocked
6452880	6454880	Anyhow
6454880	6456880	Microsoft of course isn't the only one
6456880	6458880	that has a gaming network that is continuing
6458880	6460880	to grow and develop but another
6460880	6462880	big company is launching their own game network
6462880	6464880	It's Apple, that's right
6464880	6466880	One of the big things that was announced as part of the new
6466880	6468880	iPhone 4.0 OS
6468880	6470880	is Game Center
6470880	6472880	Game Center is going to be a single
6472880	6474880	online gaming experience
6474880	6476880	for the Apple devices
6476880	6478880	that will kind of link all these games together
6478880	6480880	You'll be able to invite and track friends
6480880	6482880	You'll have matchmaking with this, leaderboards
6482880	6484880	and achievements, that's right
6484880	6486880	it's very own achievements
6486880	6488880	What's kind of interesting about this
6488880	6490880	is that systems like this already exist
6490880	6492880	somewhat in Apple's world
6492880	6494880	I don't know if any of you guys grabbed the
6494880	6496880	Commodore 64 emulator
6496880	6498880	that's available on the Apple, it was free a couple
6498880	6500880	days ago, I think just for like last
6500880	6502880	weekend, so I grabbed it
6502880	6504880	It uses a technology called OpenFaint
6504880	6506880	which I believe is by the people who made Aurora
6506880	6508880	faint, which was one of the
6508880	6510880	very early early iPhone games that was
6510880	6512880	out there, that was the same type of thing
6512880	6514880	Somebody to develop like this platform
6514880	6516880	Well what happened is that now you have
6516880	6518880	OpenFaint and you have these other competing
6518880	6520880	platforms as well, and so
6520880	6522880	Apple has finally just decided to step in and say
6522880	6524880	you know what, actually, I think
6524880	6526880	we're going to do our own thing
6526880	6528880	Not just to steal a good idea
6528880	6530880	but I think to kind of
6530880	6532880	they probably see what's happening with the developers
6532880	6534880	and that more and more game developers want to be on OpenFaint
6534880	6536880	or something like this, so Apple probably just
6536880	6538880	wants to standardize it across the board
6538880	6540880	and have ownership of it
6540880	6542880	It affects their branding
6542880	6544880	I think, so
6544880	6546880	Yeah, and as much as you want to kind of say
6546880	6548880	they're big and evil for wanting to basically
6548880	6550880	shut down OpenFaint, well they're not really shutting down
6550880	6552880	OpenFaint, but they're really
6552880	6554880	trying to render it irrelevant, although
6554880	6556880	I'm sure OpenFaint will still be around for some things
6556880	6558880	I think Apple is very
6558880	6560880	big on consistency
6560880	6562880	Hence why they have such a rigid review
6562880	6564880	thing for apps
6564880	6566880	You know, there's a reason why your apps
6566880	6568880	all kind of look and feel the same
6568880	6570880	It's because it's not like you get to make
6570880	6572880	whatever buttons you want
6572880	6574880	There are limitations to what you get to do with apps
6574880	6576880	And I think it's to give consistency
6576880	6578880	And so I think Apple
6578880	6580880	wants to take kind of reign of this
6580880	6582880	to bring that same consistency because it works well
6582880	6584880	for them
6584880	6586880	But of course there's always that controversy
6586880	6588880	because they don't really publish a lot of those guidelines
6588880	6590880	on what exactly they look for when they screen things
6590880	6592880	Yeah
6592880	6594880	By the way, some other things that were announced that will affect
6594880	6596880	gamers on the iPhone, I mean obviously
6596880	6598880	there's multitasking was the big thing, although
6598880	6600880	I got a 3G, so I'm
6600880	6602880	screwed on that one, I'm not gonna get that
6602880	6604880	Hopefully they announce a new iPhone in June
6604880	6606880	because I'm eligible for an upgrade in October
6606880	6608880	It works for the 3GS
6608880	6610880	It will work for the 3GS, but I wanna
6610880	6612880	I know Apple, there will be another
6612880	6614880	newer, nicer iPhone within
6614880	6616880	the year, so I gotta hold out
6616880	6618880	for that
6618880	6620880	They've got that in common with Nintendo, don't they?
6620880	6622880	So, yeah
6622880	6624880	I really, really, really wanna get an iPad
6624880	6626880	because I'm a big fucking sheep
6626880	6628880	But I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait till next year
6628880	6630880	because I just know that camera
6630880	6632880	on the front will be on next year's iPad
6632880	6634880	Well, Dan and I were actually
6634880	6636880	talking about how we both want
6636880	6638880	one, but we're specifically gonna
6638880	6640880	wait until another generation
6640880	6642880	goes by
6642880	6644880	And then we're
6644880	6646880	probably gonna get them
6646880	6648880	Also, by the way, just so you know,
6648880	6650880	not just the multitasking, voice over
6650880	6652880	IP in the background, like you can have Skype
6652880	6654880	running and get calls on Skype, it's pretty neat
6654880	6656880	And, again, no, not on 3G
6656880	6658880	And folders to
6658880	6660880	organize your stuff better, which
6660880	6662880	is actually really helpful
6662880	6664880	See, I think a lot of what they're incorporating, though, is stuff that they've actually stolen
6664880	6666880	from the jailbreakers
6666880	6668880	Yeah, I'm not surprised
6668880	6670880	My friend's got a jailbroken iPhone, and
6670880	6672880	it's got folders and all kinds of stuff with it
6672880	6674880	and he can use it as a storage device
6674880	6676880	and it's kinda crazy
6676880	6678880	And what was the other one?
6678880	6680880	Oh, ads, the iAds, now they're gonna
6680880	6682880	have, Apple's gonna have its own ad platform
6682880	6684880	because I guess they just didn't like AdMob
6684880	6686880	No, it's not that they didn't like it
6686880	6688880	They wanted a piece of it, but no flash
6688880	6690880	Also, it's very
6690880	6692880	interesting, I don't want to get too techy on you guys
6692880	6694880	but it's very interesting how Apple is
6694880	6696880	kind of kicking down Adobe
6696880	6698880	and they're also kicking down Google
6698880	6700880	Like, did you know that they are taking out
6700880	6702880	I mean, you still will be able to
6702880	6704880	search on the new
6704880	6706880	iPhone 4.0 OS and you can use
6706880	6708880	Google as a search engine, but the button
6708880	6710880	will not say, like it says Google
6710880	6712880	right now, it doesn't say anything else
6712880	6714880	But they're opening it up for you to use Bing
6714880	6716880	Yahoo, whatever
6716880	6718880	That sounds pretty cool
6718880	6720880	I guess
6720880	6722880	I do like the stuff that's coming
6722880	6724880	with the 4.0 OS, you know, I'm a little bummed
6724880	6726880	that it won't work on my phone, but at the same time
6726880	6728880	I'm getting a little irritated with my phone
6728880	6730880	It locks up, it's slow
6730880	6732880	I don't know, I might need to wipe it
6732880	6734880	and reinstall everything, I don't know what the hell is
6734880	6736880	making it run so crappy
6736880	6738880	But yet, here I am, still a sheet, but I will
6738880	6740880	Could it be the Apple created CPU inside
6740880	6742880	of it?
6742880	6744880	No?
6744880	6746880	I might have all these problems, but at the end
6746880	6748880	of the day, dang, I'll tell you, I use my
6748880	6750880	iPhone so freaking much
6750880	6752880	It's a great little device to have in my pocket
6752880	6754880	I will say that
6754880	6756880	Anyhow, let's move on, something non-Apple
6756880	6758880	related, Dark Sakura
6758880	6760880	Well, there are some pretty big Final Fantasy
6760880	6762880	fans out and about
6762880	6764880	And there's one person who's doing a very
6764880	6766880	interesting translation of it
6766880	6768880	They are doing Final Fantasy in
6768880	6770880	um, Latin
6770880	6772880	Yeah
6772880	6774880	Um, it's of course
6774880	6776880	going to be a ROM with a patch, but it's
6776880	6778880	in Latin
6778880	6780880	Okay
6780880	6782880	That's hardcore
6782880	6784880	It just makes me think of Eddie
6784880	6786880	as they're talking about being mugged
6786880	6788880	and saying something to them in Latin, going
6788880	6790880	Oh no, he knows Latin, run!
6790880	6792880	But I like the little
6792880	6794880	line that uh
6794880	6796880	Excuse me
6796880	6798880	I must be allergic to Latin
6798880	6800880	Um, that Destructoid has in their
6800880	6802880	little article about it, it says, now can I get a copy
6802880	6804880	of Alundra in Esperanto?
6804880	6806880	Nice
6806880	6808880	Isn't Esperanto like a
6808880	6810880	completely made up language, like it's not something
6810880	6812880	that is like It was meant to be a universal
6812880	6814880	language, so it takes elements from different
6814880	6816880	I see And actually
6816880	6818880	it's, I'll tell you what Rob, you
6818880	6820880	can look right now at a page in Esperanto
6820880	6822880	and get an idea of what they're talking
6822880	6824880	about I see, because it derives
6824880	6826880	a little bit from every language Exactly
6826880	6828880	Well that's kind of neat And I know people who are
6828880	6830880	learning it, so That's cool It sounds
6830880	6832880	cool I had a friend that spoke
6832880	6834880	it actually, it was interesting to hear
6834880	6836880	I want to call her
6836880	6838880	in Esperanto
6838880	6840880	I do not, because I have to
6840880	6842880	talk to the call, Jamie if somebody calls
6842880	6844880	in Esperanto, you're talking to him
6844880	6846880	Uh, see
6846880	6848880	See, no
6848880	6850880	Anyhow
6850880	6852880	Loki
6852880	6854880	Something in English please
6854880	6856880	Uh, yes, Fear 3
6856880	6858880	has been announced, coming from
6858880	6860880	Warner Brothers, and
6860880	6862880	what's kind of neat about the new
6862880	6864880	franchise in this horror
6864880	6866880	shooter game, is actually
6866880	6868880	it's going to be
6868880	6870880	including cinematics created by
6870880	6872880	John Carpenter
6872880	6874880	The legendary horror
6874880	6876880	master himself
6876880	6878880	What's also cool, they're going to be having
6878880	6880880	the writer Steve Niles working
6880880	6882880	on it as well, he co-wrote
6882880	6884880	the script I guess, for the game with
6884880	6886880	Carpenter, and
6886880	6888880	Steve Niles you may not remember, he also did
6888880	6890880	I believe the vampire movie
6890880	6892880	30 days a night
6892880	6894880	So, pretty good pedigree there
6894880	6896880	and I know the franchise has been pretty good
6896880	6898880	Hell, Fear 2 had some pretty awesome
6898880	6900880	multiplayer in it, especially with like
6900880	6902880	all the maps, with like the Toy
6902880	6904880	Soldier maps
6904880	6906880	and the theme song for that trailer
6906880	6908880	which I still can't get out of my head
6908880	6910880	So
6910880	6912880	Looking forward to it, and no
6912880	6914880	timeframe yet when it's been announced
6914880	6916880	It's supposed to be scheduled to be coming out in the fall
6916880	6918880	probably around November, so
6918880	6920880	on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC
6922880	6924880	Is this a game you'd probably pick up?
6924880	6926880	I haven't played the other ones
6926880	6928880	I've been kind of curious
6928880	6930880	to check it out, especially
6930880	6932880	number 2, but
6932880	6934880	maybe I'll check it out, I don't know
6934880	6936880	Well, more information coming out on
6936880	6938880	Red Dead Redemption
6938880	6940880	Of course this game was also shown off at PAX East
6940880	6942880	That was probably one of those other games that
6942880	6944880	you would have liked to see
6944880	6946880	Well, they announced this week that multiplayer
6946880	6948880	Free Rome is going to be a feature in Red Dead Redemption
6948880	6950880	I believe that's also in Grand Theft Auto 4, correct?
6950880	6952880	It's something similar
6952880	6954880	It sounds very similar to
6954880	6956880	Free Mode in
6956880	6958880	Grand Theft Auto 4, but this one's
6958880	6960880	I would say it's closer to
6960880	6962880	Party Mode in Grand Theft Auto 4
6962880	6964880	where you can join in
6964880	6966880	Let me describe it a little bit here
6966880	6968880	You can explore the full single player game world
6968880	6970880	but you'll be in a multiplayer environment
6970880	6972880	Remember Test Drive on
6972880	6974880	Xbox? It's kind of like that too
6974880	6976880	But it's separate from the single player story mode
6976880	6978880	So in Free Rome, you can either
6978880	6980880	go in by yourself, or you band together with
6980880	6982880	friends, it's together in 8
6982880	6984880	and then you can take on other little bands
6984880	6986880	You can either hunt down criminals together
6986880	6988880	or just shoot the shit out of each other
6988880	6990880	16 players in the same lobby
6990880	6992880	at once. Then you get experience points
6992880	6994880	as you do these different multiplayer modes
6994880	6996880	50 levels of character progressions
6996880	6998880	The new XP will unlock new weapons,
6998880	7000880	mounts, characters, and challenges
7000880	7002880	It sounds very similar to the Party Mode
7002880	7004880	in Grand Theft Auto 4 because you can basically
7004880	7006880	jump into
7006880	7008880	It's like a lobby
7008880	7010880	but it's basically just a portion of
7010880	7012880	the Grand Theft Auto map and if you really want to
7012880	7014880	you can just hang around in the lobby and
7014880	7016880	drive all over the entire map
7016880	7018880	or do whatever. So this is going to be
7018880	7020880	very similar to that where you can
7020880	7022880	play more of a free form version of the game
7022880	7024880	Plus they have areas where it will
7024880	7026880	launch different things like deathmatch modes
7026880	7028880	or hunting or
7028880	7030880	I believe there's a
7030880	7032880	capture the gold type
7032880	7034880	mode in there
7034880	7036880	It'll be very cool
7036880	7038880	I'm looking to try to mod this game to put
7038880	7040880	a car into it
7040880	7042880	I know the engine that they're using
7042880	7044880	is probably extremely similar to
7044880	7046880	Grand Theft Auto and if it's anything
7046880	7048880	like that game was set up it should be
7048880	7050880	very easy to do something similar like that
7050880	7052880	You and your freaking hacks
7052880	7054880	It would be hilarious. Always hacking something
7054880	7056880	rocket launchers or something
7056880	7058880	Alright, well let's get to the segment
7058880	7060880	of the show that doesn't involve cars
7060880	7062880	or bringing things
7062880	7064880	into places they shouldn't be except spam
7064880	7066880	we do get a lot of spam that shouldn't be in the
7066880	7068880	mailbag at orangelandtrader.com

7084880	7086880	dsmaster26
7086880	7088880	sent an email
7088880	7090880	Try not to sound too excited about it
7090880	7092880	It's um
7092880	7094880	very badly written and
7094880	7096880	it's giving me a headache so I think I might just
7096880	7098880	translate it into real English
7098880	7100880	Okay, go for it
7100880	7102880	I could try and read it the way
7102880	7104880	it's written
7104880	7106880	I could do it
7106880	7108880	Okay, as it's written
7108880	7110880	Dear C4 and O.L.R. Crew
7110880	7112880	I am giving
7112880	7114880	a giant F.U.
7114880	7116880	to is Microsoft because of them
7116880	7118880	raping me
7118880	7120880	in the ass for 50 bucks
7120880	7122880	Okay, I can't take it anymore, translate please
7122880	7124880	Okay, um
7124880	7126880	Dear O.L.R. Crew, I'm giving a giant F.U. to Microsoft
7126880	7128880	because of them raping me in the ass for 50 bucks a year
7128880	7130880	That is crap
7130880	7132880	I should have bought a 360
7132880	7134880	I should have bought
7134880	7136880	It's spelled B.O.U. not B.A.U
7136880	7138880	Bought the PS3
7138880	7140880	At least you should have instead of should of
7140880	7142880	I hate that
7142880	7144880	It is should have, would have, could have
7144880	7146880	So he doesn't get an F
7146880	7148880	He gets a D-
7148880	7150880	So thank you for at least avoiding one of my pet peeves
7150880	7152880	Um, here are the reasons
7152880	7154880	why
7154880	7156880	Okay
7156880	7158880	Cry
7158880	7160880	No, it's
7160880	7162880	region is R-E-G-I-O-N
7162880	7164880	Not R-E-G-I-N
7164880	7166880	Um, locking
7166880	7168880	new Beatmania to DX17
7168880	7170880	Free online play
7170880	7172880	No cost

7174880	7176880	And finally

7178880	7180880	And finally, five, um
7180880	7182880	Bluetooth, okay, god this sucks
7182880	7184880	Punctuation

7186880	7188880	Do you speak it?
7188880	7190880	Thank you
7190880	7192880	Many phones have Bluetooth
7192880	7194880	Therefore, therefore ends in an E
7194880	7196880	by the way
7196880	7198880	I can use the headset for both my phone
7198880	7200880	and PS3
7200880	7202880	I'm wondering
7202880	7204880	Is it, I
7204880	7206880	I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for
7206880	7208880	Bimani titles for PS3 and 360
7208880	7210880	Please help, I'm on a Bimani binge
7210880	7212880	ever since I played 2DX17
7212880	7214880	at the arcade in Omaha
7214880	7216880	DS Master 26
7216880	7218880	There's really not a lot available on the
7218880	7220880	360 and PS3, I will tell you
7220880	7222880	no way in hell should you spend any money on Beat and Groovy
7222880	7224880	Honestly, I like DJ Hero
7224880	7226880	a lot, I know that's not Bimani technically
7226880	7228880	but as far as music game goes
7228880	7230880	it's really the best with
7230880	7232880	Rock Band
7232880	7234880	Like if you're looking for like DDR and stuff
7234880	7236880	there's just not a lot of great stuff
7236880	7238880	You can go for Dance Dance Revolution Universe
7238880	7240880	and I would say Universe 2
7240880	7242880	is probably the best of the series
7242880	7244880	You can get Universe 3 very easily though
7244880	7246880	but it's on the
7246880	7248880	auto games or whatever
7248880	7250880	Karaoke Revolution
7250880	7252880	if you like that kind of stuff
7252880	7254880	Not my favorite
7254880	7256880	And if you really want the true Bimani experience
7256880	7258880	that they've brought to you straight to the next gen system
7258880	7260880	then Rock Revolution is definitely a title for you
7262880	7264880	That'll basically tell you
7264880	7266880	what they think of the new systems
7266880	7268880	There's a PS on here
7268880	7270880	Okay
7270880	7272880	If he does a perfect attack and freestyle DDR match
7272880	7274880	he will go down, not bloody likely
7276880	7278880	How do you perfect attack a freestyle?
7278880	7280880	I think he means
7280880	7282880	a perfect attack and then
7282880	7284880	a freestyle
7284880	7286880	I've seen people do both
7286880	7288880	The guy who had one leg
7288880	7290880	Did he even play DDR anymore?
7290880	7292880	There was a guy who had one leg
7292880	7294880	that played on crutches that perfect attacked
7294880	7296880	while he did a freestyle
7296880	7298880	You know I haven't asked him
7298880	7300880	to listen to this show though
7300880	7302880	so maybe he can email us and tell us
7302880	7304880	I think he still kind of follows it
7304880	7306880	He does a lot of DJ'ing
7306880	7308880	gigs and stuff
7308880	7310880	Not DJ Hero but real actual DJ'ing
7310880	7312880	I know that's a big hobby of his now
7312880	7314880	Where are they now?
7314880	7316880	That would be a fun segment to do on OLR
7316880	7318880	someday
7318880	7320880	Where are they now? Bimani favorites
7320880	7322880	Where is Jahi?
7322880	7324880	I haven't heard from Jahi in a long time
7324880	7326880	Maybe we need to do this
7326880	7328880	on OLR special
7328880	7330880	Maybe for our anniversary
7330880	7332880	Find Bimani people from back in the day
7332880	7334880	and do a where are they now segment
7334880	7336880	A lot of our newer listeners
7336880	7338880	wouldn't understand
7338880	7340880	Who cares?
7340880	7342880	I broke out the orange bat
7342880	7344880	I know you did
7344880	7346880	Have you seen Wendell lately?
7346880	7348880	I heard he lost a lot of weight
7348880	7350880	He's looking pretty good
7350880	7352880	He's in good shape
7352880	7354880	You know what we should do? Let's plan this
7354880	7356880	By the way Wendell, I'm very proud of you
7356880	7358880	Our 8th anniversary would be the last week of June
7358880	7360880	We should try to find as many
7360880	7362880	old school Bimani players
7362880	7364880	as possible and invite them to a show
7364880	7366880	and we could tape it
7366880	7368880	Step Squad RTF reunion?
7368880	7370880	We wouldn't necessarily have to do it here
7370880	7372880	We could find a place to remote broadcast
7372880	7374880	We could go to Sweet Tomatoes
7374880	7376880	I don't know, we'll have to find a big space
7376880	7378880	That used to be where we'd all meet up to go to dinner
7378880	7380880	years and years ago
7380880	7382880	We'd go to Sweet Tomatoes and Concord
7382880	7384880	and figure something out
7384880	7386880	We're gonna do that
7386880	7388880	for our next anniversary show
7388880	7390880	Number 9
7390880	7392880	I should go on DDR for you, you can post something
7392880	7394880	NorCal famous DDR players wanted
7394880	7396880	for a reunion special or something like that
7396880	7398880	That'd be fun
7398880	7400880	I keep a lot of them on my Facebook
7400880	7402880	I swear, because there are too many people to have here
7402880	7404880	and I don't have a big garage anymore
7404880	7406880	Dave and Busters
7406880	7408880	We could do a road show
7408880	7410880	I'm set up to do that because of PAX
7410880	7412880	We could do a road show and on top of that
7412880	7414880	We just couldn't do that live
7414880	7416880	Actually, all contrary
7416880	7418880	I may have my Wi-Fi tether
7418880	7420880	on my phone working
7420880	7422880	They have a Wi-Fi tether for the 3GS
7422880	7424880	That would be tough to do
7424880	7426880	96k to all games, that would be tough
7426880	7428880	on a Wi-Fi tether
7428880	7430880	I don't know
7430880	7432880	If anybody knows how to do it, Scott probably does
7432880	7434880	because I think he's done it before
7434880	7436880	I'll talk to him about it
7436880	7438880	We'll see
7438880	7440880	Also, now
7440880	7442880	I had received the first email
7442880	7444880	that you sent me before
7444880	7446880	but I've just been so wiped out and busy
7446880	7448880	The man
7448880	7450880	that I met at the Atari party
7450880	7452880	Sal
7452880	7454880	He sent an email and he sent me
7454880	7456880	some stuff that I want to play
7456880	7458880	Was that the music guy?
7458880	7460880	I totally want to interview him
7460880	7462880	If I was not flat broke
7462880	7464880	I want to order one of the systems
7464880	7466880	that he's got
7466880	7468880	The name's for the
7468880	7470880	Atari 800 XL
7470880	7472880	Working on Outrun
7472880	7474880	Has a version of Space Harrier
7474880	7476880	that's actually really sweet
7476880	7478880	Complete with voice, by the way
7478880	7480880	I'm very impressed
7480880	7482880	I'll go ahead and give him a plug
7482880	7484880	It's
7484880	7486880	KJ Mann's
7486880	7488880	Atari Sales and Electronics
7488880	7490880	You'll find him on eBay
7490880	7492880	He's really cool
7492880	7494880	The stuff
7494880	7496880	The ports that he's worked with
7496880	7498880	are just amazing
7498880	7500880	They're amazing
7500880	7502880	I'm very impressed
7502880	7504880	We'll try to get him on the show
7504880	7506880	It'll be fun
7506880	7508880	We'll get him to come to this OLR Con
7508880	7510880	we're suddenly planning
7510880	7512880	I wonder how much it costs to rent
7512880	7514880	a big hall somewhere
7514880	7516880	Maybe we should call it OLR Con
7516880	7518880	Just do OLR Con, for real
7518880	7520880	Just fucking do it already
7520880	7522880	My brain just suddenly made
7522880	7524880	OLR Con asylum
7524880	7526880	I don't know
7526880	7528880	We'll have to think about it
7528880	7530880	How could we do OLR Con and not have it fail miserably
7530880	7532880	where we're going to spend a lot of money on it
7532880	7534880	I don't know, we have to think about this
7534880	7536880	I think it's King of Rush
7536880	7538880	Okay
7538880	7540880	Why was Rob's mom
7540880	7542880	pwning all of us with that last phrase?
7542880	7544880	That must have been texted or something
7544880	7546880	during the show
7546880	7548880	Cause she's my mother, it's where I get my sense of humor from
7548880	7550880	And don't you dare
7550880	7552880	be trash about her
7552880	7554880	Rob's mom is such a nice lady
7554880	7556880	She's fun
7556880	7558880	So, I got one from Rababa
7558880	7560880	That's an Orange Lounge
7560880	7562880	radio
7562880	7564880	wordle
7564880	7566880	And, dude, I love
7566880	7568880	anything that's typography
7568880	7570880	Oh, I saw that, it's like the art
7570880	7572880	with all the common words from our
7572880	7574880	website, kind of like if it's used
7574880	7576880	a lot, then it's big, if it's not
7576880	7578880	B4U
7578880	7580880	B4U, at the time he did that
7580880	7582880	was like being highlighted
7582880	7584880	as like the, I love that song
7584880	7586880	You know that segment, the Dark Tetsuya in Act F
7586880	7588880	that some people do for our site?
7588880	7590880	I think B4U was like the song
7590880	7592880	that was up at the moment that that happened
7592880	7594880	I'm totally going to save the pictures
7594880	7596880	I mean, it's generated in Flash, but I have this
7596880	7598880	There's this little
7598880	7600880	fun tool to grab
7600880	7602880	images off by doing
7602880	7604880	just a plain old screenshot of it
7604880	7606880	You can crop them, I love this thing
7606880	7608880	and I'm trying to remember, I think it's called Pixlr
7608880	7610880	It's a plug-in for
7610880	7612880	um
7612880	7614880	whatever the crap this program is
7614880	7616880	that I'm using
7616880	7618880	But anyway
7618880	7620880	Um
7620880	7622880	But yeah, it's really cool, I like it
7622880	7624880	And
7624880	7626880	he
7626880	7628880	I like, he puts a comment that I suppose
7628880	7630880	that wordle filters out crashwords
7630880	7632880	Um, and
7632880	7634880	then the last one is
7634880	7636880	um
7636880	7638880	from somebody
7638880	7640880	who hasn't put a name on here
7640880	7642880	I'm just going to say Brandon
7642880	7644880	because that's the
7644880	7646880	closest thing I can find
7646880	7648880	Dear OLR, after listening to OLR archive episode
7648880	7650880	I have started
7650880	7652880	to have a bimani craze
7652880	7654880	so I spent my whole allowance
7654880	7656880	$30 on tokens
7656880	7658880	and I played some BeatMania 2DX, read
7658880	7660880	Cranked
7660880	7662880	to 11
7662880	7664880	Guitar Freaks, Drummania
7664880	7666880	Parapara, DDR, Poppin' Music
7666880	7668880	and keyboardmania, it was epic fun
7668880	7670880	Rob,
7670880	7672880	we need to go
7672880	7674880	to Rviggle soon
7674880	7676880	We can go, I mean
7676880	7678880	it's just down the street
7678880	7680880	I know, but I want to play
7680880	7682880	Rob, I gotta dance
7686880	7688880	Alright
7688880	7690880	Well anyhow, let's move on
7690880	7692880	to the part of the show
7692880	7694880	where we get a little bit of angst off our
7694880	7696880	chest, it's the FUs of the week
7696880	7698880	and they're going to start right now
7712880	7714880	FU to the
7714880	7716880	big pile of
7716880	7718880	carrot cake in my fridge
7718880	7720880	I
7720880	7722880	have eaten almost nothing but carrot cake
7722880	7724880	all day, except when I came home
7724880	7726880	and ate a rib
7726880	7728880	I ate a rib
7728880	7730880	Oh, and some chips
7730880	7732880	It was very tasty rib, it was delicious
7732880	7734880	and I think
7734880	7736880	he got kosher beef too
7736880	7738880	anyway, it was really good
7738880	7740880	but anyway
7740880	7742880	I can't
7742880	7744880	I can't eat any more cake
7744880	7746880	I can't, I don't think that I can
7746880	7748880	and my
7748880	7750880	my tummy behaved
7750880	7752880	very well yesterday despite all the beer
7752880	7754880	I think all the beer broke everything else down
7754880	7756880	but today I'm suffering for it, so
7756880	7758880	fuck you gluten
7758880	7760880	done
7760880	7762880	Go ahead Logie
7762880	7764880	FU to the KFC
7764880	7766880	special sauce that they put on the
7766880	7768880	KFC Double Down, it really
7768880	7770880	ruined the Double Down and it's unfortunate
7770880	7772880	because it had the potential to be
7772880	7774880	a great, unhealthy piece of
7774880	7776880	chicken that I could have eaten
7776880	7778880	but instead it was
7778880	7780880	just all nasty sauce that they tasted
7780880	7782880	maybe next time I will have to do
7782880	7784880	the pseudo
7784880	7786880	Windows 7 burger and get a 7x7
7786880	7788880	from
7788880	7790880	Oops, Holik came in early, my bad
7790880	7792880	I was gonna say that
7792880	7794880	FU to Holik, playing early
7794880	7796880	anyways, yeah, so
7796880	7798880	a
7798880	7800880	I should do a Windows
7800880	7802880	7 pseudo burger
7802880	7804880	from In-N-Out 7x7
7804880	7806880	I've had a
7806880	7808880	4x4 before, they're really
7808880	7810880	not as filling as you would think
7810880	7812880	My FU
7812880	7814880	of the week goes to my confidence
7814880	7816880	and self esteem because I'm starting a new job
7816880	7818880	tomorrow and I'm really nervous
7818880	7820880	it's gonna be like so
7820880	7822880	different for me, they're all gonna laugh at you
7822880	7824880	laugh at me, no, I know I'll do fine
7824880	7826880	but it's just, it's weird because like guys
7826880	7828880	seriously, the day job I've had, I've been
7828880	7830880	because, okay, it was funny because when
7830880	7832880	I post, I have listeners on my Facebook and when I
7832880	7834880	posted to Facebook that I was leaving my old
7834880	7836880	job, people were like, oh, you get to do OLR full
7836880	7838880	time now and I'm like
7838880	7840880	hahaha
7840880	7842880	hahaha
7842880	7844880	hahaha, that's funny
7844880	7846880	yeah
7846880	7848880	no, I mean, it's
7848880	7850880	great that people think that we could actually
7850880	7852880	profit from this show, but no, my
7852880	7854880	day job that I do
7854880	7856880	the day job I have to pay them, in fact
7856880	7858880	trying to plan this OLR con, I'm
7858880	7860880	thinking like, how do I lose the least
7860880	7862880	amount of money in planning this
7862880	7864880	but anyway
7864880	7866880	on a
7866880	7868880	serious note, I have a day job and the day job I've had
7868880	7870880	I've had for the past like seven years
7870880	7872880	so almost as long as OLR has been
7872880	7874880	going on, which is a fucking long time, just you know
7874880	7876880	and I'm changing that, I'm doing
7876880	7878880	a new job starting tomorrow and it's
7878880	7880880	kind of nerve-wracking, but
7880880	7882880	I think it'll be good, I'm
7882880	7884880	excited about what the
7884880	7886880	new position is and obviously I don't like to talk a lot about
7886880	7888880	my day job on the show, because I don't want no presents
7888880	7890880	showing up at my workplace
7890880	7892880	or bombs, you know what I mean
7892880	7894880	yeah, please no, just
7894880	7896880	no, so anyhow
7896880	7898880	yeah, I mean, I think it's great
7898880	7900880	that people send gifts, but I don't know, just something
7900880	7902880	weird about having my address out there
7902880	7904880	I'd just like to know who you are, that's all
7904880	7906880	it was also on my business card, well, our
7906880	7908880	Orange Lunch Radio business card
7908880	7910880	so you think one of our...
7910880	7912880	someone could have gotten it, I don't know, who knows, alright, anyhow
7912880	7914880	I'm over it, alright, that's it for the FUs
7914880	7916880	of the Week, couple more news stories for you guys
7916880	7918880	then the Skype line, and believe it or not
7918880	7920880	our chat, or I'm sorry
7920880	7922880	our phone works again, it was broken
7922880	7924880	last week, it works again
7924880	7926880	877-GAME-OLR works
7926880	7928880	also Orange Lunch Radio on Skype, both
7928880	7930880	of them will work, but we're not taking calls yet
7930880	7932880	we still got two more stories, Loki
7932880	7934880	yes, so let's talk a little
7934880	7936880	bit about how
7936880	7938880	not to do collector's editions
7938880	7940880	that's right, Splinter Cell
7940880	7942880	Conviction, it's a wonderful game
7942880	7944880	coming out this coming week
7944880	7946880	here, and apparently
7946880	7948880	they're dropping $10 off the
7948880	7950880	price of the collector's edition because
7950880	7952880	guess what, the USB drive that they included
7952880	7954880	with it is faulty
7954880	7956880	apparently there's
7956880	7958880	a possibility of faulty USB drives
7958880	7960880	included with the game, and so
7960880	7962880	they're knocking $10 off of it to
7962880	7964880	kind of compensate for that
7964880	7966880	and apparently none of the other
7966880	7968880	content has been affected, but
7968880	7970880	the bonus content included on the USB
7970880	7972880	drive may be inaccessible
7972880	7974880	in some copies
7974880	7976880	well that turned out
7976880	7978880	to be a bummer for someone, didn't it?
7978880	7980880	yeah, that is a bummer, and
7980880	7982880	let me tell you this much
7982880	7984880	from a
7984880	7986880	distributor, reseller
7986880	7988880	standpoint, that's gonna be
7988880	7990880	a fucking bitch when I come in on Monday
7990880	7992880	because we're gonna have to deal with all
7992880	7994880	these credits to people that
7994880	7996880	we sold the game to because
7996880	7998880	Ubisoft fucked up, so
7998880	8000880	thank you, Ubisoft
8000880	8002880	appreciate it
8002880	8004880	and whoever manufactured those little USB cards
8004880	8006880	are gonna get taken to the cleaners
8006880	8008880	you know what I mean?
8008880	8010880	yeah
8010880	8012880	and you know, really the USB cards
8012880	8014880	what they have on them here, they've got a little
8014880	8016880	artwork here
8016880	8018880	is a credit card size
8018880	8020880	USB drive that had
8020880	8022880	making of video, concept art renders
8022880	8024880	screenshots, storyboards
8024880	8026880	and wallpapers, who gives a shit
8026880	8028880	well can't you format that thing now and use it as
8028880	8030880	storage on your 360?
8030880	8032880	no you cannot because I don't believe it is over a gig
8032880	8034880	you need at least a gig
8034880	8036880	to be able to use it, so
8036880	8038880	and you really wanna have 16 gigs
8038880	8040880	cause you only get two cards, right?
8040880	8042880	this is so weird to me
8042880	8044880	so weird to me, well it was kind of a slow news week
8044880	8046880	and we found this article on
8046880	8048880	as a popular destination on Dig
8048880	8050880	and I thought what the hell, we'll bring it up on the show
8050880	8052880	it's from IGN and it talks about the most
8052880	8054880	anticipated Xbox Live arcade games
8054880	8056880	that are coming up to the service
8056880	8058880	and I thought I'd kind of gauge the reaction here
8058880	8060880	in studio, if our studio folks are excited
8060880	8062880	about these games, and those of you in chat
8062880	8064880	as well, kind of leading into
8064880	8066880	phone calls, this makes a good story
8066880	8068880	this is from IGN.com, so you know, take it with a grain of salt
8068880	8070880	Limbo
8070880	8072880	is one of the games that they talk about here
8072880	8074880	and this was pretty cool, they had
8074880	8076880	they were demoing this at PAX East, it's kind of like that
8076880	8078880	black and white, very artistic kind of
8078880	8080880	style with it, look kind of neat
8080880	8082880	Sonic the Hedgehog 4
8082880	8084880	very anticipated Xbox Live game
8084880	8086880	Yay!
8086880	8088880	Shank!
8088880	8090880	That was being shown at PAX earlier this year
8090880	8092880	it's not Shaft, but Shank
8092880	8094880	and he has a steel blade
8094880	8096880	it's very bloody, looks like your kind of game
8096880	8098880	Hydrophobia, which was also
8098880	8100880	shown at PAX East, it's like
8100880	8102880	kind of a Tomb Raider-ish type of game
8102880	8104880	but she's afraid of the water
8104880	8106880	well that makes me think of Bioshock
8106880	8108880	Puzzle Quest 2
8108880	8110880	Don't care
8110880	8112880	Speak for yourself, I am totally on this
8112880	8114880	That's why I was speaking for myself, I don't care
8114880	8116880	I do care, so I'm excited about that
8116880	8118880	Might and Magic Clash of Heroes
8118880	8120880	Don't care
8120880	8122880	Yeah, looks like it could be interesting
8122880	8124880	The art style looks really good
8124880	8126880	because it's
8126880	8128880	They have it on the DS
8128880	8130880	Super Meat Boy
8130880	8132880	Yay!
8132880	8134880	Don't care
8134880	8136880	I have a custom coffee mug
8136880	8138880	that I painted Super Meat Boy on
8138880	8140880	Oh really? That's cute
8140880	8142880	Also on the other side has Eduardo the Samurai Toaster
8142880	8144880	That's my WeWear
8144880	8146880	coffee mug that I made
8146880	8148880	And I'm actually kidding, it looks interesting
8148880	8150880	Comic Jumper
8150880	8152880	I don't know this one
8152880	8154880	Oh, The Maw and Explosion Man
8154880	8156880	That's a good developer there
8156880	8158880	Okay, Comedy Shooter
8158880	8160880	Is that supposed to be like Earthworm Jim or something?
8160880	8162880	Probably, similar
8162880	8164880	Monday Night Combat
8164880	8166880	That looks awesome
8166880	8168880	They had a business at PAX East
8168880	8170880	And they had an announcer guy out there on the show floor
8170880	8172880	So it seems like all of these games
8172880	8174880	were just PAX East games
8174880	8176880	I think someone at IGN
8176880	8178880	got a little lazy
8178880	8180880	There you go
8180880	8182880	I'm also looking forward to Magic Sword Double Impact
8182880	8184880	Or whatever they're actually calling it
8184880	8186880	That's coming out
8186880	8188880	So funny
8190880	8192880	Anyhow, the phones
8192880	8194880	are now open
8194880	8196880	And Game OLR or our username on Skype
8196880	8198880	is OrangeLoungeRadio
8198880	8200880	If you'd like to call to talk about, I don't know
8200880	8202880	Anticipated Xbox Live Arcade Games or heck anything
8202880	8204880	I know, you know, we were out
8204880	8206880	two weeks ago and then last week
8206880	8208880	we had some troubles with the phones and we were only able to
8208880	8210880	take a couple calls
8210880	8212880	So I'm sure there will be plenty of people who want to get through tonight
8212880	8214880	And that's fine, we have a little extra time for calls
8214880	8216880	I don't want to do the show too late tonight
8216880	8218880	But we have some time for calls
8218880	8220880	So again, 877 Game OLR
8220880	8222880	or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
8222880	8224880	It is now open and available for calls
8224880	8226880	SHA100Matt wants us to know
8226880	8228880	he played MNC at PAX East
8228880	8230880	and it was awesome
8230880	8232880	Okay, the phones are starting to ring, here we go
8232880	8234880	Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8234880	8236880	It's Ranma
8236880	8238880	Looks like I got through the first time once again
8238880	8240880	Look at you, you must have the
8240880	8242880	least amount of lag or something
8242880	8244880	Well, what's up?
8244880	8246880	Not too much, man
8246880	8248880	Couple of things now
8248880	8250880	To reference back to earlier in the episode
8250880	8252880	They did port Twilight Seen It
8252880	8254880	to the Nintendo DS
8254880	8256880	Came out about a couple of months ago
8256880	8258880	But Twilight Seen It
8258880	8260880	isn't like a Twilight game to me
8260880	8262880	I know, but
8262880	8264880	I get your points
8264880	8266880	But it's just like, they need to make an actual game
8266880	8268880	Well, actually they don't need to, but I'm surprised
8268880	8270880	they haven't, you know what I mean?
8270880	8272880	Well, Rob, I'm all for a
8272880	8274880	Twilight game, provided it plays
8274880	8276880	in a third person shooter like Conker's Bad Fur Day
8276880	8278880	and I get to shoot them all up
8278880	8280880	Then I will buy that
8280880	8282880	I don't know if I'd
8282880	8284880	buy it, but I might get it on Gamefly
8286880	8288880	So that way I feel like I'm not
8288880	8290880	really supporting them, but
8290880	8292880	even if I am a little bit
8292880	8294880	You won't feel as dirty
8294880	8296880	Alright, well there you go
8296880	8298880	What else is on your mind, buddy?
8298880	8300880	About an article earlier today
8300880	8302880	about the kid that stole the code from Breach
8302880	8304880	Yes, although
8304880	8306880	technically that was last week's show, but that's okay
8306880	8308880	Last week we had the phone problems
8308880	8310880	What do you think?
8310880	8312880	I was trying to call in, but
8312880	8314880	on our podcast we covered this
8314880	8316880	and my
8316880	8318880	gaming girl who did
8318880	8320880	some research on the article
8320880	8322880	it seems that
8322880	8324880	the company that did the game I think is Atomic Games
8324880	8326880	they're backed by the CIA
8326880	8328880	so I'm
8328880	8330880	kind of thinking that this was all like a little
8330880	8332880	set up, like a publicity stunt
8332880	8334880	Well, now hold on
8334880	8336880	Didn't they say that because
8336880	8338880	of what you're saying that it actually
8338880	8340880	made this theft of the code a lot
8340880	8342880	worse than it would be otherwise
8342880	8344880	like this kid is almost being
8344880	8346880	investigated by the FBI at this point
8346880	8348880	I don't know, I might be throwing in some extra
8348880	8350880	stuff there, but it seemed like
8350880	8352880	from what we were reporting last week, what he did
8352880	8354880	wasn't just bad, it was really bad
8354880	8356880	Pretty much
8356880	8358880	but if you're going to cross reference that
8358880	8360880	in, I'm just saying
8360880	8362880	because of how this came out
8362880	8364880	I don't know about you, but
8364880	8366880	if this was a big deal, don't you think everybody
8366880	8368880	at PAX would have been hearing about this?
8370880	8372880	Maybe they did, maybe it just happened
8372880	8374880	at a time we weren't around, I don't know
8374880	8376880	I certainly didn't hear anything like that
8376880	8378880	I didn't either, but at the same time
8378880	8380880	I was kind of in and out of there
8380880	8382880	we left to eat, we left
8382880	8384880	I came in late a lot of days
8384880	8386880	just because of the time zone thing
8386880	8388880	I don't know
8388880	8390880	It would be a really weird
8390880	8392880	obesity stunt type of thing
8392880	8394880	Weren't there court documents produced
8394880	8396880	and everything too?
8396880	8398880	I have no idea
8398880	8400880	I have not heard anything about it
8400880	8402880	I will believe
8402880	8404880	this guy actually did something
8404880	8406880	stupid, you know
8406880	8408880	but if there are no court documents, I call shenanigans
8408880	8410880	I see where you're coming from though
8410880	8412880	how could someone be so
8412880	8414880	colossally stupid, it just seems so fake
8414880	8416880	but some people
8416880	8418880	are that stupid, Rama
8418880	8420880	I know, I used to work
8420880	8422880	with people like that
8422880	8424880	Well
8424880	8426880	I don't know, fake or not
8426880	8428880	it certainly has got everybody talking
8428880	8430880	which, yeah
8430880	8432880	you might have hit the nail on the head of the irony
8432880	8434880	of it, is that more people are talking about this game now
8434880	8436880	than probably would have otherwise
8436880	8438880	Pretty much
8438880	8440880	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, my friend?
8442880	8444880	That's pretty much it
8444880	8448880	ActDeaf in our chat wants to say Matt posted the court files earlier
8448880	8450880	He's probably digging up the links again right now
8450880	8452880	so stay tuned to our chat rooms
8452880	8454880	Yeah, I'll definitely be following that
8454880	8456880	Alright, take care buddy
8456880	8458880	Alright, bye-bye
8458880	8460880	Let's go back to the phones
8460880	8462880	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio, who's this?
8462880	8464880	Hi, it's Ray Iyanami
8464880	8466880	Hey, Ray Iyanami, what's on your mind, buddy?
8466880	8470880	I came up from Stock Card Con last week
8470880	8472880	my first Stock Card Con
8472880	8474880	You went all the way up to Seattle
8474880	8476880	to go to Stock Card Con?
8476880	8478880	Yes, I went with some friends
8478880	8480880	to meet up with some friends up there
8480880	8482880	among other things
8482880	8484880	Well, I don't know, you don't sound too happy
8484880	8486880	was it a good time, or what happened?
8486880	8488880	I'm sorry, I'm just tired for this week
8488880	8490880	so
8490880	8494880	Anyway, Stock Card Con is pretty cool, yes
8494880	8498880	I get to play a lot of games there
8498880	8500880	like Tetris or Grandmaster 3
8500880	8504880	and some other crap
8504880	8507880	Well, I'm glad you said nice things about it in the end
8507880	8509880	because our buddy John who does
8509880	8511880	Understation Live with Travis
8511880	8513880	I know is a big part of putting on Stock Card Con
8513880	8515880	Did you happen to run into him at all?
8515880	8517880	He's probably too busy
8517880	8520880	I saw him hosting the Anime Magician panel
8520880	8522880	but
8522880	8524880	I didn't get a chance to talk to him much
8524880	8526880	so I never actually got to meet him
8526880	8528880	Eh, it happens
8528880	8530880	Had you ever been to that venue before?
8530880	8532880	Because that's the same place they do PAX Prime
8534880	8536880	No, it was my first time
8536880	8538880	I was surprised at how big it was
8538880	8541880	I could actually compare it to a shopping mall
8541880	8544880	Especially since part of it is like a shopping mall
8544880	8547880	Yeah, it's kind of integrated right into the downtown scene there, isn't it?
8547880	8549880	Well, tell us a little more about the gaming they had there
8549880	8551880	Did they have like a big room? Were they doing tournaments?
8551880	8553880	What was kind of going on with gaming?
8553880	8555880	Well, they had an arcade
8555880	8557880	but it wasn't too big
8557880	8559880	Mostly DVR
8559880	8561880	In the Groove
8561880	8564880	They had a Pumped Up Pro 2 Location Test
8564880	8566880	They had NFL Day 4
8566880	8568880	guitar-proofing, drum-mania
8568880	8571880	and Patrick P, Jim's Threes and myself already
8571880	8574880	I would have played Pumped Up Pro 2
8574880	8577880	but unfortunately, like the 2DS, I was at the con
8577880	8580880	I was wearing a concept that involved dress shoes
8580880	8582880	and dress shoes and
8582880	8584880	arrow-stopping games
8584880	8586880	those seemed like a good idea
8586880	8588880	Were you cosplaying?
8588880	8590880	What were you cosplaying as?
8590880	8592880	I was cosplaying as a
8592880	8594880	shell from Pop'n Music
8594880	8596880	the librarian guy
8596880	8598880	and Apollo Justice
8598880	8600880	I wanted to cosplay as this one character
8600880	8602880	cosplay as this one character from Toho
8602880	8604880	but I didn't have a costume prepared
8604880	8606880	and
8606880	8608880	speaking of the Toho panel
8608880	8610880	there was one thing that I didn't like about it
8610880	8613880	and that was them trying to demonstrate the Toho games
8613880	8616880	they tried to demonstrate it by showing
8616880	8618880	one of the game's later stages
8618880	8620880	on lunatic difficulty
8620880	8622880	but it's basically a difficulty level of a part
8622880	8624880	and as a small fan, they kind of pissed me off
8624880	8628880	Because maybe they made the game look way harder than it really is?
8628880	8630880	Yeah, pretty much
8630880	8633880	I mean, I'm pretty sure a lot of the people who weren't really into
8633880	8635880	the Naku games were just confused
8635880	8637880	what the hell was going on
8637880	8639880	I mean, if I was running
8639880	8640880	If I was
8640880	8642880	If I had a partner running the panel
8642880	8644880	alongside the infamous stuff
8644880	8646880	I would also show demonstration using
8646880	8648880	easier stages and difficulties
8648880	8651880	Something that requires effort
8651880	8653880	to get through
8653880	8655880	but is still pretty watchable
8655880	8657880	that way people who are new to the series
8657880	8659880	can have a grasp of
8659880	8661880	what it's like to play the game
8661880	8663880	instead of just saying
8663880	8665880	Oh wow, pretty bullets, super adequate
8665880	8667880	dodge, any of that shit
8667880	8669880	Yeah, it's
8669880	8671880	I gotta say though
8671880	8673880	a lot of those shmups are so hard to me
8673880	8675880	but you know, it takes talent
8675880	8677880	to be good at them though, takes talent
8677880	8679880	That's for sure
8679880	8681880	I mean, whenever I try to show people
8681880	8683880	games, I don't go
8683880	8685880	straight to like full rising
8685880	8687880	if it's a fighting game or
8687880	8689880	showing them level 43 points on top
8689880	8691880	I try to show them
8691880	8693880	easier stuff, something you can actually understand
8693880	8695880	Like, a few months ago
8695880	8697880	I was at an arcade with a friend of mine
8697880	8699880	and she went through the top
8699880	8701880	so I kind of
8701880	8703880	popped into her use of easier
8703880	8705880	songs, even if it meant songs that
8705880	8707880	I didn't find to be as fun as
8707880	8709880	songs that I usually play
8709880	8711880	That's a really good point, is that if you're not wanting to scare someone
8711880	8713880	off, especially with the music games, you shouldn't
8713880	8715880	show off right away, like a lot of people
8715880	8717880	I think sometimes just want to like show off
8717880	8719880	how good they are at a game, so they'll pick like
8719880	8721880	the really hard song and like, look how cool this game
8721880	8723880	can be, and then people are like, ooh, I'm too scared to touch that
8723880	8725880	I don't want to touch that, so you kind of have to
8725880	8727880	warn people into it by showing them like, you know, on
8727880	8729880	the rock band, the easy mode, or you know
8729880	8731880	a one star, whatever difficulties
8731880	8733880	they're doing in pop music these days
8733880	8735880	you know, the really low end songs
8735880	8737880	and that kind of goes with video games in general, like if you
8737880	8739880	don't want to scare someone off, like you know they wouldn't
8739880	8741880	like a shooter game, don't show them Halo
8741880	8743880	or Gears of War, show them a video game
8743880	8745880	that might be more their tastes
8745880	8747880	you know, like whether that be something like
8747880	8749880	one versus a hundred, you know, might be
8749880	8751880	a really good enabler for people
8751880	8753880	to see that there's more to video games than that
8753880	8755880	or, you know, something on the Wii
8755880	8757880	I don't know, it is interesting
8757880	8759880	I think sometimes people really
8759880	8761880	scare people off from video games without realizing it
8761880	8763880	because they go right for the hard stuff
8763880	8765880	and a lot of people do get intimidated
8765880	8767880	Yeah, there
8767880	8769880	are, I think, channels and forums
8769880	8771880	I hang out at where people are not
8771880	8773880	too good at video games, so
8773880	8775880	I kind of get
8775880	8777880	how they feel about not being
8777880	8779880	able to get past the
8779880	8781880	first season for Shmopp on, even on easy
8781880	8783880	difficulty
8783880	8785880	Alright, well
8785880	8787880	we gotta let you go so we can get some more
8787880	8789880	calls, but, so, SakuraCon, do you think
8789880	8791880	you'd try to go back next year?
8791880	8793880	Um, possibly
8793880	8795880	if my spring break is around
8795880	8797880	SakuraCon again, because that lets you
8797880	8799880	one big deciding factor
8799880	8801880	in me doing it. Last year it didn't line up
8801880	8803880	with my spring break, so I didn't go
8803880	8805880	So if the timing's right, it just might be in the
8805880	8807880	cards. Alright, well, we gotta let you go
8807880	8809880	to get more calls, but take care of Ray, okay?
8809880	8811880	You too. Alright, later
8811880	8813880	Alright, I'll take a couple more calls
8813880	8815880	here. 877-GAME-OLR
8815880	8817880	or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
8817880	8819880	Take a few more calls
8819880	8821880	here before we call it a night at
8821880	8823880	OLR Studios. Some last minute
8823880	8825880	stories tonight we'll have in just a moment
8825880	8827880	but first, another call. Hi, you're
8827880	8829880	on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8829880	8831880	Hi, this is Spasinator
8831880	8833880	Hey, Spasinator, you're
8833880	8835880	cutting in and out a little bit, but we'll try to move
8835880	8837880	ahead. What's on your mind, buddy?
8837880	8839880	Sorry about that, I'm on a
8839880	8841880	cell phone and unfortunately some
8841880	8843880	stuff in my building interferes
8843880	8845880	with the signal. That's okay.
8845880	8847880	But anyway, I tried
8847880	8849880	calling in last week to give you
8849880	8851880	updates as to my
8851880	8853880	PlayStation 3 situation
8853880	8855880	Oh yeah, it's been a little while since we heard about that
8855880	8857880	Yeah, we had our phone issues last week. Well, what's
8857880	8859880	the latest and greatest?
8859880	8861880	I can make this short
8861880	8863880	and sweet. You know,
8863880	8865880	I'll probably gloss over the details, but
8865880	8867880	the drill points are
8867880	8869880	that I got my
8869880	8871880	PS3 back on the 30th
8871880	8873880	and
8873880	8875880	a few days later, they
8875880	8877880	started putting my
8877880	8879880	videos back onto my
8879880	8881880	download queue
8881880	8883880	because the video store
8883880	8885880	works differently than the
8885880	8887880	game side of the store. Anyway,
8887880	8889880	it took a while
8889880	8891880	for everything to show up
8891880	8893880	because they had to do
8893880	8895880	everything manually
8895880	8897880	and reauthorize everything
8897880	8899880	and I get like over several hundred
8899880	8901880	videos, but needless
8901880	8903880	to say, I
8903880	8905880	got all my videos back, so I don't have to
8905880	8907880	worry about that now.
8907880	8909880	Wow, 700 videos. Oh my gosh.
8909880	8911880	Okay.
8911880	8913880	Yeah, well, not all those videos
8913880	8915880	are paid for. Some of those are
8915880	8917880	like
8917880	8919880	the free music game
8919880	8921880	out is like promotions to get
8921880	8923880	you to buy throughout the series
8923880	8925880	or whatever that's there.
8925880	8927880	But
8927880	8929880	needless to say, I got my
8929880	8931880	videos back and
8931880	8933880	hopefully
8933880	8935880	nothing goes wrong with
8935880	8937880	the video service in the future, but
8937880	8939880	I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed
8939880	8941880	on that, so.
8941880	8943880	I'm sorry,
8943880	8945880	I didn't mean it. No, that's right.
8945880	8947880	I know you say you didn't want to get into too many of the
8947880	8949880	details, but I'm kind of curious because I know you
8949880	8951880	they were putting, I mean, it sounds like in
8951880	8953880	the end, you got what you
8953880	8955880	really needed
8955880	8957880	and deserved back. I mean, it sounds like
8957880	8959880	it had to be a very manual process
8959880	8961880	for Sony, so it sounds like they almost weren't set up
8961880	8963880	to handle a request like yours, but
8963880	8965880	I'm kind of curious, how did you ultimately
8965880	8967880	kind of get them to come
8967880	8969880	around, because you were going back and forth with them.
8969880	8971880	If you go back a few episodes in the show when you were first calling
8971880	8973880	in about this, you were going back and forth
8973880	8975880	with Sony a little bit, and we told you
8975880	8977880	you might have to speak with the supervisor or just kind of
8977880	8979880	put up a stink. I mean, is that what ultimately
8979880	8981880	happened? You sadly had to be
8981880	8983880	that guy on the phone in order for them to finally
8983880	8985880	listen to you?
8985880	8987880	This time around,
8987880	8989880	not to the same extent,
8989880	8991880	although I did
8991880	8993880	keep what you and Dr.
8993880	8995880	Zirk said in
8995880	8997880	mind the initial time I
8997880	8999880	hit this problem,
8999880	9001880	and initially
9001880	9003880	it looked like I was going to have to go that road
9003880	9005880	because the first person I spoke to
9005880	9007880	said
9007880	9009880	to sum it up,
9009880	9011880	sorry dude,
9011880	9013880	you're so low on that,
9013880	9015880	but
9015880	9017880	in subsequent calls
9017880	9019880	speaking to other reps
9019880	9021880	prior to me saying I'm a machine
9021880	9023880	and they said, yeah, once you send the machine
9023880	9025880	in and they send it
9025880	9027880	back to me,
9027880	9029880	they'll do everything and reauthorize
9029880	9031880	everything to download.
9031880	9033880	You know,
9033880	9035880	I just have to interject here,
9035880	9037880	because as someone who has worked very closely
9037880	9039880	with call centers in their
9039880	9041880	day job, to me
9041880	9043880	that's a huge issue that you
9043880	9045880	called in two times and got two different
9045880	9047880	answers. And for anybody,
9047880	9049880	you know, Sony's a big company and who knows
9049880	9051880	we might have somebody at Sony who happens to listen to
9051880	9053880	this program. To me, that's a big issue.
9053880	9055880	You should not call a call center, speak to two
9055880	9057880	different people and get two different answers.
9057880	9059880	I agree with that. I actually did customer
9059880	9061880	service for a very long time and I did
9061880	9063880	well
9063880	9065880	by the time the department was called Service Quality where we
9065880	9067880	if they had a question they could
9067880	9069880	call us and ask us and we would tell them
9069880	9071880	and make sure you repeat this.
9071880	9073880	But yeah, everyone is supposed to be
9073880	9075880	on the same page. And don't get me wrong,
9075880	9077880	I'm glad Spazinator got what he
9077880	9079880	wanted. He just should have gotten it the first
9079880	9081880	time. You know, so this is if
9081880	9083880	we can learn anything from this phone call, if
9083880	9085880	you are at Sony, there's some
9085880	9087880	edumacation to be done amongst
9087880	9089880	your reps. This is also a
9089880	9091880	prime example why every time
9091880	9093880	you talk to someone in a call center, you write down
9093880	9095880	their name, you write down the date and the time that you
9095880	9097880	spoke with them and you keep a track of what
9097880	9099880	you talked about. They have to keep notes too.
9099880	9101880	Anyway, I know Spazinator... I'm sorry. No, that's okay.
9101880	9103880	But no, it's important. Spazinator is dying to jump
9103880	9105880	in here again. Sorry Spaz.
9105880	9107880	Yeah, I was going to say,
9107880	9109880	I never worked at a call center before.
9109880	9111880	The closest thing to that is working
9111880	9113880	at a grocery store, you know,
9113880	9115880	at the front desk.
9115880	9117880	But I basically
9117880	9119880	talked about the initial
9119880	9121880	response I got to like,
9121880	9123880	perhaps, you know, the one
9123880	9125880	rep that I usually spoke to
9125880	9127880	having an off day,
9127880	9129880	you know, every deal with
9129880	9131880	Apple customers, they weren't
9131880	9133880	quite as friendly as I was
9133880	9135880	or maybe possibly
9135880	9137880	you know,
9137880	9139880	the rep
9139880	9141880	possibly having some kind of
9141880	9143880	bad information or gainer
9143880	9145880	information mixed up somehow.
9145880	9147880	But ultimately, regardless
9147880	9149880	of, you know, what the case
9149880	9151880	may be, you know, ultimately
9151880	9153880	I got my stuff back, which is
9153880	9155880	the key thing there.
9155880	9157880	So, you know,
9157880	9159880	if, God forbid,
9159880	9161880	I kept gaining the same
9161880	9163880	response time and time again,
9163880	9165880	then I would, you know,
9165880	9167880	escalate the call to
9167880	9169880	a supervisor like U3
9169880	9171880	has suggested
9171880	9173880	the first time this kind of
9173880	9175880	thing happened.
9175880	9177880	So basically you didn't come to that, but,
9177880	9179880	you know,
9179880	9181880	God forbid it.
9181880	9183880	Yeah, no, I was just going to say, yay Sony
9183880	9185880	for getting it right, but, you know,
9185880	9187880	it is a bummer that it did take you
9187880	9189880	a little bit of a run around to do it, but, you know,
9189880	9191880	they made it right and we should recognize
9191880	9193880	that, you know, at least it wasn't the doom and gloom
9193880	9195880	we thought it was going to be. But I'm
9195880	9197880	fascinated. I got to wrap up because we got to see if we can
9197880	9199880	fit in one or two more calls. Do you have anything else
9199880	9201880	or a footnote to this or anything else you want to share with
9201880	9203880	listeners?
9203880	9205880	Nothing comes to mind, but I'll keep
9205880	9207880	you guys posted on
9207880	9209880	Twitter if there's anything that comes up
9209880	9211880	or if I think anything
9211880	9213880	early during the week.
9213880	9215880	Sounds good buddy.
9215880	9217880	Alright, good luck with everything. Take care
9217880	9219880	buddy.
9219880	9221880	I just got to read this comment from chat, which is interesting.
9221880	9223880	SHA100Matt says, I'll say this again,
9223880	9225880	buy and have hard copies of your movies
9225880	9227880	from now on. This is the second time that's happened
9227880	9229880	and if you ask me it's totally not worth it going through this
9229880	9231880	hassle. You know,
9231880	9233880	it's tough because there's a lot about digital
9233880	9235880	distribution I do want to support, but you know,
9235880	9237880	SHA100Matt makes a good point. It's like
9237880	9239880	if there were hard copies, you wouldn't have had to
9239880	9241880	go through this in the first place, but
9241880	9243880	I don't know.
9243880	9245880	I don't know. I'm kind of torn because like, you know,
9245880	9247880	I've bought things online. I've done the digital
9247880	9249880	distribution thing, but I've kind of taken
9249880	9251880	a lot of that for granted maybe. Alright.
9251880	9253880	I just buy TV episodes sometimes online, like
9253880	9255880	if I'm buying on Supernatural. That's why I like
9255880	9257880	Netflix because Netflix, you know, you're not really
9257880	9259880	buying anything. You just kind of rent it.
9259880	9261880	Anyhow, let's do at least one more call here and then we're going to be on our way out.
9261880	9263880	Hey, Aaron Orange on the radio. Who's this?
9263880	9265880	Hi. This is your friendly neighborhood
9265880	9267880	Mexican. Act Deaf. Hey, Act Deaf.
9267880	9269880	I'm glad to see you weren't shaken
9269880	9271880	too bad by the earthquake that happened last
9271880	9273880	week right before the show.
9273880	9275880	Yeah, we were shaken, but
9275880	9277880	not stirred. Not stirred. Alright.
9277880	9279880	Well said. What's
9279880	9281880	on your mind tonight, buddy?
9281880	9283880	I just wanted to add about
9283880	9285880	the Twitter topic I sent
9285880	9287880	earlier about the Mexican
9287880	9289880	game being
9289880	9291880	developed and brought over
9291880	9293880	by Konami.
9293880	9295880	I just wanted to add that
9295880	9297880	it's being distributed here
9297880	9299880	in Mexico, but it's
9299880	9301880	being distributed by another company.
9301880	9303880	Okay, well that's good to know
9303880	9305880	because I think earlier I had said, oh haha, it's not
9305880	9307880	coming out of Mexico even though it's a Mexican game, but
9307880	9309880	that's just, Konami's not
9309880	9311880	putting it out there. Someone else is. Okay, that makes sense.
9311880	9313880	Yeah, it's actually made by
9313880	9315880	Colombian and Mexican
9315880	9317880	developers. It's being published
9317880	9319880	I think by
9319880	9321880	well, developed by
9321880	9323880	well, the
9323880	9325880	sorry.
9325880	9327880	The main development is being held
9327880	9329880	here in Mexico, though Colombia is
9329880	9331880	helping also over their
9331880	9333880	studios. I don't remember
9333880	9335880	the name of the development company, but
9335880	9337880	it's just starting
9337880	9339880	right now to develop games
9339880	9341880	and I hope, I really hope that
9341880	9343880	this game
9343880	9345880	at least develops or
9345880	9347880	brings a market over Mexico
9347880	9349880	because it's a
9349880	9351880	very small market and it's
9351880	9353880	starting right now.
9353880	9355880	I was going to say, I can't say
9355880	9357880	and maybe you can correct me here, but I can't say I can
9357880	9359880	think of any like big games or even
9359880	9361880	medium sized games that we can say
9361880	9363880	this game was developed in Mexico by
9363880	9365880	a Mexican company or
9365880	9367880	Colombia or any of these other places.
9367880	9369880	This seems to be like the first game we're really
9369880	9371880	at least that I'm aware of
9371880	9373880	that is developed like that.
9373880	9375880	Yeah, there's not
9375880	9377880	really a market for like
9377880	9379880	Xbox 360 or PS3
9379880	9381880	games, maybe even Wii games
9381880	9383880	that are developed
9383880	9385880	at least this large.
9385880	9387880	There may be cell phone games
9387880	9389880	that are being developed here
9389880	9391880	and are made by companies like
9391880	9393880	Gameloft and other
9393880	9395880	companies, but
9395880	9397880	for a console
9397880	9399880	it's pretty much the first.
9399880	9401880	There are
9401880	9403880	games coming out for
9403880	9405880	the Wii and the 360
9405880	9407880	that are also
9407880	9409880	based on Mexican
9409880	9411880	franchises like
9411880	9413880	soap opera even,
9413880	9415880	but at least it's starting to
9415880	9417880	grow. Do you see PS2 development?
9417880	9419880	Because my thought would be that a lot of these countries
9419880	9421880	that they're not really being supported
9421880	9423880	with the 360 and PS3, it seems that maybe
9423880	9425880	the PS2 is still big there.
9425880	9427880	Actually,
9427880	9429880	the PS2 isn't
9429880	9431880	that big right now.
9431880	9433880	It's maybe the PS3 or
9433880	9435880	the 360 maybe.
9435880	9437880	Maybe on other places
9437880	9439880	like Brazil
9439880	9441880	and especially
9441880	9443880	because of their import
9443880	9445880	and taxes over there,
9445880	9447880	the PS2 is starting to gain
9447880	9449880	momentum there, but
9449880	9451880	here, even though
9451880	9453880	the games, and I have talked about this before,
9453880	9455880	the games are pretty expensive, but
9455880	9457880	at least we're on the
9457880	9459880	same market as America.
9459880	9461880	You mentioned
9461880	9463880	Brazil and the first thing I thought of was
9463880	9465880	I thought the Master System was still big in Brazil.
9465880	9467880	Yeah, it's still big.
9467880	9469880	It's like, whoa.
9469880	9471880	They also have the re-releases. Didn't we have a story
9471880	9473880	about the Genesis repackaging that was coming
9473880	9475880	out in Brazil? There's some
9475880	9477880	interesting things going on with old school games
9477880	9479880	in Latin America.
9479880	9481880	If I recall correctly, it's called
9481880	9483880	the Bebo.
9483880	9485880	It was brought over here
9485880	9487880	in Mexico, though it didn't.
9487880	9489880	It wasn't as big
9489880	9491880	as in Brazil. Interesting.
9491880	9493880	Cool stuff. Well, we hope
9493880	9495880	the game does well. I know
9495880	9497880	it's probably not going to be a huge thing
9497880	9499880	here, but I know there's a lot of people that are
9499880	9501880	really into that Mexican wrestling stuff and
9501880	9503880	just like there are the WWE
9503880	9505880	and all that stuff, so I'm sure
9505880	9507880	it will definitely have its audience.
9507880	9509880	It doesn't look that bad.
9509880	9511880	It looks decent.
9511880	9513880	I totally love Mexican wrestling.
9513880	9515880	I've played some of the WWE games, and
9515880	9517880	they look good, and it looks
9517880	9519880	at the same part.
9519880	9521880	Alright, well, we'll see. We'll hope it does well.
9521880	9523880	At least if nothing else, it'll help the
9523880	9525880	development market down there and get some more
9525880	9527880	games out of there of some ideas.
9527880	9529880	Anything else you want to share with the listeners
9529880	9531880	real quick tonight, ACT-F?
9531880	9533880	Well, only that
9533880	9535880	we're okay over here in
9535880	9537880	Nezcali. Even though it
9537880	9539880	was a pretty big quake, there was
9539880	9541880	only pretty much
9541880	9543880	structural damages.
9543880	9545880	There were only two lives lost
9545880	9547880	and only a couple
9547880	9549880	hundred injuries, but
9549880	9551880	other
9551880	9553880	than that, we're pretty fine over here,
9553880	9555880	though there are people that
9555880	9557880	are needed
9557880	9559880	of services and maybe
9559880	9561880	like camping tents
9561880	9563880	and all that stuff, but
9565880	9567880	other than that, we're pretty
9567880	9569880	good. Hopefully,
9569880	9571880	at least here in America,
9571880	9573880	the folks want to donate to
9573880	9575880	the relief efforts. I'm sure
9575880	9577880	the Red Cross has something set up. They always do
9577880	9579880	for the cases like this, so definitely
9579880	9581880	folks should look into that. I'm glad
9581880	9583880	to hear that for the most part, everything's okay.
9583880	9585880	It's sad
9585880	9587880	that even one life was lost, but
9587880	9589880	it sounds like it could have been a lot
9589880	9591880	worse based on how bad
9591880	9593880	the quake itself was, so
9593880	9595880	I'm glad to hear that at least
9595880	9597880	you and everyone you care
9597880	9599880	about are okay.
9599880	9601880	All right, well, Act F, we're
9601880	9603880	going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call, okay?
9603880	9605880	Thank you. All right, take care, my friend.
9605880	9607880	All right,
9607880	9609880	that's going to do it for tonight's calls, and sorry
9609880	9611880	for those folks that didn't get through.
9611880	9613880	It was ringing pretty good tonight because
9613880	9615880	we actually had
9615880	9617880	a lot of people that were trying to get in
9617880	9619880	tonight because of last week, but
9619880	9621880	yeah, we've got to wrap it up, you guys.
9621880	9623880	I'm starting
9623880	9625880	a new job tomorrow. I can't be here all night,
9625880	9627880	and you know, Dark Soccer wants to go to bed
9627880	9629880	eventually, and Matt might
9629880	9631880	want to go back to KFC and ask for a double down
9631880	9633880	with no sauce, so we'll see.
9633880	9635880	All right. I'm kind of hungry because I didn't
9635880	9637880	need anything. I offered to make ribs.
9637880	9639880	You can have cake. I don't need ribs.
9639880	9641880	I'm going to have healthy special
9641880	9643880	K cereal when I go home. All right.
9643880	9645880	Anyhow, we've got to wrap
9645880	9647880	up, you guys, and get on out of here
9647880	9649880	so we can. Ooh, or a baked potato. I'm going to have
9649880	9651880	a baked potato.
9651880	9653880	All right. We've got to, uh-oh.
9653880	9655880	Uh-oh. We have a stream
9655880	9657880	down error. Winamp has crashed.
9657880	9659880	God dammit.
9659880	9661880	All right. That's okay. We're going to just keep going here.
9661880	9663880	At least it's at the end of the show.
9663880	9665880	Yeah, at least it's at the end of the show.
9665880	9667880	Hold on, guys. Dang it.
9667880	9669880	Poopy!
9669880	9671880	All right. We're still recording for podcasts,
9671880	9673880	so can someone fill a little time here
9673880	9675880	while I get us... I'm actually trying to find something to send
9675880	9677880	you for cage match. Okay, that's fine.
9677880	9679880	And, um...
9679880	9681880	I had the same problem, but then I found something.
9681880	9683880	Well, I was
9683880	9685880	going to... Who was the winning song last time?
9685880	9687880	That would be, I think, you, Rob.
9687880	9689880	Was I with the Goldfrapp song? It wasn't me.
9689880	9691880	Yeah, you were with the Goldfrapp song. Okay, that's fine.
9691880	9693880	So I was going to do, like, a throwaway.
9693880	9695880	Okay, there we go. So we're still going.
9695880	9697880	Now we're back up, and it's streaming on all games again.
9697880	9699880	I don't know what happened. So, okay.
9699880	9701880	Now we can actually wrap up the show. Winamp froze,
9701880	9703880	you guys. I don't know why it does that.
9703880	9705880	It's irritating. Because it's Winamp.
9705880	9707880	I guess. I mean, it might need to upgrade the version
9707880	9709880	or something. We'll have to run some tests.
9709880	9711880	You need to upgrade your version.
9711880	9713880	We'll have to run some tests before the next show, I don't know.
9713880	9715880	But that's weird, because just closing
9715880	9717880	Skype shouldn't bork Winamp like that.
9717880	9719880	I don't know what happened. Alright, well
9719880	9721880	it is what it is. Anyhow, um...
9721880	9723880	We're still going to wrap up
9723880	9725880	and be on out of here for the night.
9725880	9727880	Thanks so much for our Skype callers. Thank you guys
9727880	9729880	for listening to our show and supporting our
9729880	9731880	independent radio. I gotta get
9731880	9733880	last minute stories, though, before I give my whole spiel here.
9733880	9735880	It looks like Matt has a million tabs open on
9735880	9737880	Firefox over there. Yes, I do.
9737880	9739880	A million instances of the Unicorn game.
9739880	9741880	DarkSire, do you have any last minute stories
9741880	9743880	real quick before we go?
9743880	9745880	Rawr. I just want to check.
9745880	9747880	Alright, Loki then.
9747880	9749880	Ok, so Dark Void Zero, that
9749880	9751880	wonderful 2D version
9751880	9753880	of, or 8-bit 2D version
9753880	9755880	of the game Dark Zero
9755880	9757880	that hit the DSiWare
9757880	9759880	is now going to be hitting the iPhone
9759880	9761880	and PC actually tomorrow.
9761880	9763880	So that's pretty awesome.
9763880	9765880	And it'll cost you $2.99
9765880	9767880	on the iPhone and $5 on PC.
9767880	9769880	So that's not bad. I actually may purchase that for my
9769880	9771880	arcade cabinet. I think that would fit in just
9771880	9773880	nice and easy.
9773880	9775880	And a game that I was playing earlier
9775880	9777880	this week.
9777880	9779880	I always had trouble pronouncing this.
9779880	9781880	Espacaluda 2
9781880	9783880	will be hitting the iPhone as well.
9783880	9785880	Also, actually
9785880	9787880	it should have already hit the iPhone because that would have been
9787880	9789880	on the 10th.
9789880	9791880	That's awesome.
9791880	9793880	My friend linked
9793880	9795880	a Japanese video of that in and I
9795880	9797880	was actually already looking for it.
9797880	9799880	But I don't know that...
9799880	9801880	I don't know how well I controlled it on the iPhone.
9801880	9803880	It looked pretty responsive
9803880	9805880	on that video. So I'm totally thinking
9805880	9807880	about getting it.
9807880	9809880	Very cool.
9809880	9811880	Let's see here. And then
9811880	9813880	there's some interesting
9813880	9815880	tie-ins apparently with Melgir Solid
9815880	9817880	Peace Walker.
9817880	9819880	They're going to have two different games
9819880	9821880	tie-in with it. First one, Monster Hunter
9821880	9823880	is actually
9823880	9825880	going to be tie-in with it as well.
9825880	9827880	Monster Hunter Portable 2nd-G
9827880	9829880	I guess
9829880	9831880	there's going to be content from that game
9831880	9833880	that's going to be able to
9833880	9835880	work with Peace Walker
9835880	9837880	which is weird.
9837880	9839880	Apparently the little
9839880	9841880	cat-like characters
9841880	9843880	the felines
9843880	9845880	that appear in the Monster Hunter series
9845880	9847880	are going to appear
9847880	9849880	in the Melgir Solid Peace Walker
9849880	9851880	game as well.
9851880	9853880	So that's interesting.
9853880	9855880	And then another weird one
9855880	9857880	that's a crossover. Apparently
9857880	9859880	you will also be able to link up
9859880	9861880	Melgir Solid
9861880	9863880	Peace Walker with
9863880	9865880	Front Mission Evolved
9865880	9867880	on the Playstation 3 and
9867880	9869880	Xbox 360. Players will be able
9869880	9871880	to exchange parts acquired from
9871880	9873880	Peace Walker bosses
9873880	9875880	in Front Mission Evolved.
9875880	9877880	How the hell does that work?
9877880	9879880	But that's interesting.
9879880	9881880	And you can use them for your
9881880	9883880	mechs that you build in that game.
9883880	9885880	Talk about cross-company
9885880	9887880	promotions there. That's kind of neat
9887880	9889880	actually. I actually want to
9889880	9891880	check out that new Peace Walker game.
9891880	9893880	Or Front Mission.
9893880	9895880	And then Professor Layton
9895880	9897880	is actually coming over here. It's getting a Western
9897880	9899880	release. The movie that is
9899880	9901880	developed by
9901880	9903880	Level 5 and
9903880	9905880	that looks kind of neat.
9905880	9907880	An anime movie.
9907880	9909880	People will dig that.
9909880	9911880	And of course with any
9911880	9913880	game out there with voluptuous
9913880	9915880	women, there will be
9915880	9917880	a way that they will find to strip them
9917880	9919880	of their clothes. And
9919880	9921880	that was the
9921880	9923880	exact thing that happened
9923880	9925880	with Dead or Alive Paradise.
9925880	9927880	People have found a way to
9927880	9929880	swap out the
9929880	9931880	textures in the game and now we get
9931880	9933880	wonderful, nippleous,
9933880	9935880	naked women. I'm sure it wasn't very hard with a
9935880	9937880	Dead or Alive game. So yeah, that game is
9937880	9939880	five bucks on iTunes and I'm buying it right now.
9939880	9941880	Espagluta?
9941880	9943880	Yes.
9943880	9945880	Good luck controlling it on the iPhone.
9945880	9947880	Just not my favorite
9947880	9949880	gaming platform.
9949880	9951880	And then finally, there was a patent
9951880	9953880	file for Rumble
9953880	9955880	in DS. I'm assuming
9955880	9957880	it's going to be in the 3DS.
9957880	9959880	Oh, I'm sure. Yeah, I think there's been
9959880	9961880	rumblings of Rumble for quite some time.
9961880	9963880	Yeah.
9963880	9965880	And hopefully dual analog sticks would be
9965880	9967880	nice. It would be great.
9967880	9969880	Because everybody likes dual analog sticks.
9969880	9971880	I'm not going to hold my breath though.
9971880	9973880	I got a couple things thrown at me here in chat.
9973880	9975880	SSG100Matt reminded
9975880	9977880	me that I don't think we ever mentioned the winner
9977880	9979880	of USL Madness or
9979880	9981880	the March Madness, if you will, that happens
9981880	9983880	on Orange on its Radio. I think we were off the week it
9983880	9985880	ended and then of course last week's show was just
9985880	9987880	off. Chrono Trigger
9987880	9989880	1 for the first time
9989880	9991880	was the declared the greatest game of all time
9991880	9993880	by your voting
9993880	9995880	at OrangeOnitsRadio.com. I
9995880	9997880	thoroughly disagree with your votes
9997880	9999880	but whatever. I mean it's not like Chrono Trigger is a bad game.
9999880	10001880	But I guess it was destined to win one of
10001880	10003880	these years. I've just decided
10003880	10005880	in these contests, people just vote the way
10005880	10007880	I don't vote.
10007880	10009880	And I don't know if it's a ha ha
10009880	10011880	let's make Rob mad or whatever, but whatever.
10011880	10013880	I can think of a lot of games
10013880	10015880	a lot of games worse than
10015880	10017880	Chrono Trigger. Yay Chrono Trigger
10017880	10019880	and yay everybody that participated in
10019880	10021880	boo and poop on those that didn't.
10021880	10023880	And also as Tigerclaw points out Microsoft
10023880	10025880	has changed the increments of which you have to
10025880	10027880	purchase Microsoft points to more
10027880	10029880	manageable numbers
10029880	10031880	instead of some weird rounded off numbers.
10031880	10033880	It's actually four hundred and eight hundred
10033880	10035880	and sixteen hundred and four thousand.
10035880	10037880	Is it really? Yes. I'd heard that they were doing
10037880	10039880	that so they got rid of five hundred one thousand
10039880	10041880	and all that all together? Yeah.
10041880	10043880	Well shit, now what if I have extra points I want to use?
10043880	10045880	Am I screwed?
10045880	10047880	It's like go get a card at the store?
10047880	10049880	I don't know. Tigerclaw
10049880	10051880	is cut and paste in tons of links for us.
10051880	10053880	He also posted a link that I think is worth mentioning.
10053880	10055880	Blockbuster, you know Blockbuster
10055880	10057880	is kind of hurting right now. They're closing stores left
10057880	10059880	and right. One of the things they're trying to
10059880	10061880	do to, I guess you could say either compete
10061880	10063880	with Netflix or Gamefly or both.
10063880	10065880	They are doing their games
10065880	10067880	by mail service. It's going to
10067880	10069880	cost an extra seven ninety nine
10069880	10071880	plus tax on top of the standard
10071880	10073880	I guess you could say monthly fees.
10073880	10075880	You'll be able to rent one game
10075880	10077880	at a time and that's the total number
10077880	10079880	of discs that you're allowed to have out on the plan.
10079880	10081880	So there you go. If you don't check
10081880	10083880	any games out during the one month period though
10083880	10085880	you're not charged the money. Kind of interesting
10085880	10087880	how that all works. It's currently being
10087880	10089880	tested in Cleveland, Ohio.
10089880	10091880	Because Cleveland rocks.
10091880	10093880	Cleveland rocks. Ohio.
10093880	10095880	I'm thinking actually
10095880	10097880	you say that I think of Howard the Duck.
10097880	10099880	You live in Cleveland.
10099880	10101880	Drew Carey show.
10101880	10103880	I don't watch that.
10103880	10105880	It was like ten years ago.
10105880	10107880	I didn't watch that.
10107880	10109880	They even had a Rocky Horror themed episode.
10109880	10111880	I did see that.
10111880	10113880	Well, see. Wait, how did you not watch the show
10113880	10115880	yet? See that episode. I saw the clip
10115880	10117880	on YouTube. Yeah, YouTube. YouTube
10117880	10119880	it ruins everything. Alright.
10119880	10121880	Anyhow, I think we're done. Is that it?
10121880	10123880	Did you get all your stories, Logie?
10123880	10125880	Yeah, all the ones I wanted to.
10125880	10127880	Some guy beat some Asteroids record too.
10127880	10129880	Hey now, don't haze
10129880	10131880	Tiger Claw in chat.
10131880	10133880	This is the Tiger Claw link show.
10133880	10135880	He does a good job. Act F says Tiger Claw
10135880	10137880	more efficient than Google. Seriously.
10137880	10139880	And Dan Mufroga Returns is apparently
10139880	10141880	popping up on DSiWare as well.
10141880	10143880	Cannot die.
10143880	10145880	Cannot die. This is why I like
10145880	10147880	doing a show with a live chat room because when
10147880	10149880	I don't know the answer instead of sitting here looking like an idiot
10149880	10151880	or making something up. I mean I still look like an idiot.
10151880	10153880	But I'll just go, hey chat, what was
10153880	10155880	the answer to that? Somebody always knows.
10155880	10157880	And if it involves a link, Tiger Claw has it
10157880	10159880	in five seconds. If not, SSA 100
10159880	10161880	Matt. It's like a little friendly competition.
10161880	10163880	We should have a total board.
10163880	10165880	Or something.
10165880	10167880	Alright, anyhow.
10167880	10169880	Of course, thank you guys so much. All the chatters
10169880	10171880	that help make the show happen. You guys really are
10171880	10173880	the fourth guest on the show always.
10173880	10175880	And of course, you guys for listening. I know we have a lot
10175880	10177880	of people on the podcast who just can't be here for
10177880	10179880	whatever reason Sunday night. So thank you guys so much
10179880	10181880	for downloading our show and tuning in and supporting
10181880	10183880	independent radio. You guys are awesome.
10183880	10185880	And thanks so much. Always say
10185880	10187880	if you enjoy the show, just tell somebody
10187880	10189880	about the show.
10189880	10191880	Or leave a nice review on iTunes or
10191880	10193880	some other podcast site. Just help us spread the word
10193880	10195880	because we don't have a big magazine
10195880	10197880	or a big million dollar website or game
10197880	10199880	company behind us. We're just
10199880	10201880	kids like you that like video games.
10201880	10203880	Except we're not kids anymore.
10203880	10205880	That's the sad part.
10205880	10207880	Anyhow, that's going to do it for another episode of
10207880	10209880	Orange Lounge Radio. But not until we go around to get everybody's
10209880	10211880	final thought. DarkSakura, do you have
10211880	10213880	a final thought for us tonight?
10213880	10215880	Meh. Cake!
10215880	10217880	Loki, do you have a final thought
10217880	10219880	for us tonight? I'm hoping to finish Final Fantasy
10219880	10221880	13 soon. Although I have a feeling
10221880	10223880	I'm not going to be able to because I have to get all the
10223880	10225880	achievements. And I have lots
10225880	10227880	of games to start playing.
10227880	10229880	My final thought
10229880	10231880	is the website
10231880	10233880	ffxivcore.com
10233880	10235880	is making me foam at the mouth.
10235880	10237880	That's really what it boils
10237880	10239880	down to. Anyhow,
10239880	10241880	thank you guys again. Have a great week.
10241880	10243880	We will be back next week with more
10243880	10245880	of Orange Lounge Radio to do this all over
10245880	10247880	again. New
10247880	10249880	stories and all that other stuff.
10249880	10251880	But the same old crap that you've
10251880	10253880	come to love week to week. We'll
10253880	10255880	see you next time here on Orange
10255880	10257880	Lounge
10257880	10259880	Radio.
10259880	10261880	Of course it would help if I would have the
10261880	10263880	end of the show theme song queued up.
10263880	10265880	Because when I don't have that I just
10265880	10267880	sit here in silence and it's kind of awkward.
10267880	10269880	Much better. Here we go. Good night!
10297880	10299880	See you next week!
