00:00.000 --> 00:18.840
Tonight, April 18th, 2010, PlayStation Network releases are on the move.

00:18.840 --> 00:23.000
Does playing violent video games impact your sleep and how can you get free soundtracks

00:23.000 --> 00:31.800
from recent releases?

00:31.800 --> 00:37.800
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 363 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game

00:37.800 --> 00:40.640
talk show where every gamer has a voice.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.960
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

00:43.960 --> 00:46.480
the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.360
Does it count if I only have half a voice?

00:49.360 --> 00:52.400
You know, I just got this feeling coming in here tonight, Dark Sakura, that you really

00:52.400 --> 00:55.040
weren't prepared for tonight's episode and that's okay.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.200
We all have our off days, but let me, let me paint a picture for the listeners.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.360
Just, just imagine if you will, you know, I get here to Jamie's house and yeah, I get

01:01.360 --> 01:02.360
here.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.660
You should hear about an hour before showtime because you know, we have to prep the intro

01:04.660 --> 01:08.160
and get the mixing board set up and all the things that have to happen to make a show

01:08.160 --> 01:09.160
work.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.160
I wasn't naked.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.160
No, you weren't naked.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
Thank God.

01:12.160 --> 01:17.040
But the minute I walk in the door and I start to kind of walk back towards the room, Jamie's

01:17.040 --> 01:18.480
like, Oh, hold on a minute.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.760
And she runs to the bathroom.

01:19.760 --> 01:20.760
Like, like she's the flash.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.000
Oh, do not.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.760
She runs to the bathroom like the flash and I'm like, Oh, Oh, I guess she just had Taco

01:26.760 --> 01:28.800
Bell for lunch or something.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.640
And she comes out and she, she's, she's carrying something and she, she runs into a room and

01:33.640 --> 01:34.880
I'm like, what is going on?

01:34.880 --> 01:42.320
And she's like, sorry, I just, I didn't want you to see my unmentionables drawing.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.240
Like girl, please.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.520
Like I've never seen a bra before.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.840
I might be gay, but it doesn't mean that, you know.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.680
But I am modest.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.760
No, I know.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.600
I'm a very modest person.

01:52.600 --> 01:58.440
I may be a modest in personality, but I make up for it in personal modesty.

01:58.440 --> 02:01.800
And she probably doesn't appreciate me telling that story on the air, but it's funny.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.800
And that's what's most important.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.800
You're worse than my mother.

02:03.800 --> 02:04.800
All right.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.400
Also say hello to the one and only, uh, tech master low key.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.400
Hello.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.680
Thankfully I have not seen his unmentionables hanging up to dry, even though we lived together

02:12.680 --> 02:13.680
for a couple of years.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.880
He was, he was very good about folding his laundry because we had a dryer and probably

02:16.880 --> 02:17.880
putting it away.

02:17.880 --> 02:18.880
Yes.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.680
You can't put a bra in the dryer.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.680
It warps.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.680
Exactly.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.680
Didn't we learn anything from watching Hedvig?

02:25.680 --> 02:29.240
Uh, we put, you know, uh, bras in the dryer all the time.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.240
It's just fine.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.240
Yeah.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.240
You don't do it when you pay 50 bucks for them.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.240
All right.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.240
Eddie out.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.240
All right.

02:35.240 --> 02:39.880
Uh, once in a while we talk about video games here on this program, not just drying bra,

02:39.880 --> 02:43.120
drying bras, but how was your week, low key?

02:43.120 --> 02:48.040
Tons of the, uh, young male demographic really want to know how to wash a bra.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.160
That's important life skills.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
You know what?

02:51.160 --> 02:52.160
You know what?

02:52.160 --> 02:53.160
Wait till you're married.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.160
You know what?

02:54.160 --> 02:55.160
You'll get a woman to sleep with you like that.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.160
If you know how to do her laundry.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.160
Seriously.

02:57.160 --> 03:03.280
If Dan would do my laundry, I'd be happy, but I'm too afraid he'll screw it up.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.280
True story.

03:04.280 --> 03:09.380
Um, dark soccer and I took a trip to the cherry blossom festival yesterday in San Francisco

03:09.380 --> 03:12.360
and Jamie had one of her friends and I had Alan with me and it was like the four of us

03:12.360 --> 03:13.360
in San Francisco.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.440
We were at the San Francisco cherry blossom festival and we went to this bookstore, the

03:17.440 --> 03:18.440
Japanese bookstore.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.440
You know the name of it?

03:19.440 --> 03:20.440
I don't know.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.440
Okay.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.440
Thank you.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.440
Um, good shoe tight.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.440
Uh, so they, it's a really large store.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.080
Like they have magazines on the first floor and uh, you know that you can get a copy of

03:28.080 --> 03:32.160
for me to their manga and entire yaoi section, which is pretty impressive, but they have

03:32.160 --> 03:36.740
some funny like English books upstairs, like gift gag books, like one little section and

03:36.740 --> 03:42.160
one of the books I saw was porn for women and you open it up and it's just like pictures

03:42.160 --> 03:46.480
of guys like not like, no, I mean they're clothed and everything, but it's like a guy

03:46.480 --> 03:50.880
holding a baby saying like, gosh, why don't I take care of the child for an hour so you

03:50.880 --> 03:54.160
can go out to a movie or something and you know, or vacuuming.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.160
Yeah.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.160
Guys have naked vacuuming and you know what?

03:58.160 --> 04:01.000
I'm actually, I don't really think that many of those guys are super attractive because

04:01.000 --> 04:02.400
they're like too muscular.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.680
You know, I like, I like a, I like a David Bowie.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.680
You like him a little nerdy.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.680
I like him a little androgynous.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
All right.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.680
All right.

04:10.680 --> 04:19.520
And I married Dan who was like so completely dude it doesn't, but you know, Dan fights

04:19.520 --> 04:26.560
with me and, and you know what the, you know what the song is Break Up to Make Up.

04:26.560 --> 04:33.320
Oh, well, hey, oh, hey, all right, well, uh, let's uh, get into video games and start off

04:33.320 --> 04:35.040
the show as we usually do.

04:35.040 --> 04:40.120
Not with a broad discussion or, or cherry blossom discuss him, but for the record, what?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.800
It's a really comfy bra.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.000
How was your gaming week?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Help.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.720
Oh wait, I have to say the spiel about the chat room.

04:46.720 --> 04:51.600
Uh, we do tape live every week on all games radio, www.allgames.com at six Pacific right

04:51.600 --> 04:52.920
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:52.920 --> 04:56.280
If you are listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chair room.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.320
If we haven't scared you off yet, congratulations.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.880
Chat dot orange lounge, radio.com.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.620
Jamie, how was your gaming week?

05:01.620 --> 05:04.080
I did lots of gaming, Rob.

05:04.080 --> 05:11.840
I've beaten espa beluga whale, too.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.080
Why do I want to add another syllable there?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.080
Espa-gluda.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.080
Yes.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
Two.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.080
Espa-gluda.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.080
Twice on my iPhone.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
Dose.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.700
It is amazing on the iPhone.

05:22.700 --> 05:30.080
It is seriously easy to control, very, very, very, very, very, very overwhelmingly Japanese

05:30.080 --> 05:32.400
as in they didn't bother translating it, just the text.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.840
Um, and in fact, the endings have a little bit of Engrish in them.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.000
I think it's hilarious and it's just fun.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
It's really fun.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.540
You have like two different, you have two modes with three difficulties and, um, the,

05:44.540 --> 05:47.440
the way that I've just been playing in novice mode, just to get used to it, of course, of

05:47.440 --> 05:48.720
course I beat it.

05:48.720 --> 05:55.200
Um, but in novice mode you have auto fire on and, um, you only have your, what is it?

05:55.200 --> 05:57.060
Your enlightened attack or something.

05:57.060 --> 06:02.120
And then it, you have to, then you've got another thing open for regular mode and then

06:02.120 --> 06:06.400
all of your selections open, including your fire on the other.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.720
So, but really I just like shooting stuff and it's really, it's a gorgeous game.

06:09.720 --> 06:10.720
It is gorgeous.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.840
I've actually on my, um, my Twitter, I've put a few, I actually put probably my last

06:15.840 --> 06:19.480
three twit pic posts have been pictures of the game.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.120
So it's pretty epic.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.560
I find I've been really neglecting my Twitter these past couple of weeks.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.560
Like I've just been very bad.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.840
That's what happens when you're getting there.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.480
Which is, no, it has nothing to do with that.

06:29.480 --> 06:33.480
I think it has to do with the fact that I, I'm having, I mean, here's the thing, there's

06:33.480 --> 06:37.180
a lot of great OLR listeners that follow me on Twitter and I want to share, especially

06:37.180 --> 06:42.400
like the gamey related things and you know, funny life stories and little, you know, vignettes

06:42.400 --> 06:47.960
and little things like, yes, vignettes, it's a fun word to say vignette, uh, in 140.

06:47.960 --> 06:53.600
Is that the brand of your bra vignette, um, 140 characters or less.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.600
But here's the thing.

06:54.600 --> 07:02.560
My bra is comfy, I'm having a hard time justifying my continued existence and participation on

07:02.560 --> 07:09.360
a website where Justin Bieber is the number one topic of discussion every single day.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.360
Like I kind of feel like on moral grounds, I kind of object.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.360
You know what, Rob?

07:14.360 --> 07:15.360
I don't pay attention to that shit.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
It makes things a lot better.

07:16.360 --> 07:22.040
Whenever you go to twitter.com, trending topics, Justin Bieber, because half the people are

07:22.040 --> 07:26.000
like, you know, you know, fawning over him, the other half are like, who's Justin, Justin

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Bieber.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I really don't know who that is.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Anyway.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.240
I don't look at the trending topics.

07:30.240 --> 07:36.480
I think like a Disney channel, I still want to get President Cat as a trending topic.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.000
We tried that a long time ago.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.880
We got, we got us a mention on some of the game blogs, but it didn't, didn't get trending

07:41.880 --> 07:42.880
topics.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.880
They're, they're, they're buttholes.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.880
All right.

07:44.880 --> 07:45.880
Love, love, love, love.

07:45.880 --> 07:46.880
All right.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.880
Anyway.

07:47.880 --> 07:48.880
Sorry.

07:48.880 --> 07:57.920
We got us Espa Galuda, Beluga, I played Beluga, um, um, um, oh yeah, I actually started a

07:57.920 --> 08:01.360
little bit of Braid and then, um, I remember that I had a whole bunch of other stuff I

08:01.360 --> 08:02.360
had to do.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.360
I played some STO.

08:03.360 --> 08:07.720
I'm really way behind on Star Trek Online right now and I will tell everybody why, and

08:07.720 --> 08:09.360
you saw me working on it.

08:09.360 --> 08:16.400
Um, so I'm going to give it a plug because I can, the temple that I go to, um, here in

08:16.400 --> 08:21.720
Sacramento or Orangeville, technically, um, temple or Rishon is having a fundraiser, big,

08:21.720 --> 08:27.960
big fundraiser in the area, um, on, on Sunday, the 25th, it's called All That Jazz.

08:27.960 --> 08:28.960
Just look it up online.

08:28.960 --> 08:33.600
Um, big fundraiser, twenties, thirties, forties themed kind of roundabout.

08:33.600 --> 08:38.240
And I'm doing their newsletter, I'm doing a big newspaper for them as a giveaway to

08:38.240 --> 08:42.960
everyone who comes in and you know, so that's what I've been tearing my hair out over and

08:42.960 --> 08:43.960
I was sick.

08:43.960 --> 08:48.920
So if you're in the area, if you're in the area, come share a lahaim, spend a good 60

08:48.920 --> 08:49.920
bucks and go.

08:49.920 --> 08:50.920
All right.

08:50.920 --> 08:51.920
It's a, it's a fundraiser.

08:51.920 --> 08:57.460
It's for a good cause, but as a result, I've had no life and I've been sick on top of it

08:57.460 --> 09:00.640
and I'm actually feeling a lot better today than I did.

09:00.640 --> 09:04.320
My voice is coming and going, but I've been sick.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.440
So while I've been sick, I've been working on this.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.360
So yeah, but it's coming along well.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.060
Tiger Claw in our chat room, uh, links us to a Wikipedia article on Justin Bieber because

09:15.060 --> 09:18.460
of course Wiki will solve everything, but let me put it in a nutshell.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.800
You know what, like Donny Osmond was like 30 years ago.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.160
Like he was so Mormon.

09:22.160 --> 09:26.600
Oh, this guy's like, yeah, that's just, that's, that's basically what Justin Bieber is now,

09:26.600 --> 09:27.600
but without the crazy sister.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.600
He has hat hair.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.600
Yeah.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.600
Anyway, that please no more Justin Bieber talk on this program.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.600
He has hat hair.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.640
Uh, and then Shahran says, if you have that much of a problem with it, then maybe you

09:35.640 --> 09:36.840
should stop using Twitter.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.960
Shahran, that's exactly what's happened the past couple of weeks.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.560
I've been Facebooking and now four squares.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.800
The other one I use, which I really shouldn't use, like I'm going to get posted on please

09:45.800 --> 09:48.440
rob me.com, but I'm kind of addicted to it.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.440
Like I can't explain it.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.200
It's, it's partially a game.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.480
They made a game out of social networking.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.480
I don't know.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.480
You know what?

09:55.480 --> 09:56.480
I pretty much stick with my Facebook.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.280
Look, at least I gave up Farmville, so I think I deserve props for that.

09:59.280 --> 10:03.400
I'm trying to pay more attention to Twitter because I've, as I was telling you yesterday

10:03.400 --> 10:09.280
about my plan to become, um, a true nothing celebrity, you know, I want to be famous for

10:09.280 --> 10:10.280
absolutely nothing.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.280
Like Paris Hilton.

10:11.280 --> 10:16.160
I said, I'm not going to put my twat on the internet, but you have to be rich.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.540
Well, that's what sponsorships for.

10:18.540 --> 10:19.540
Not necessarily.

10:19.540 --> 10:20.540
Tila Tequila.

10:20.540 --> 10:24.640
I mean, I, I look at her and I go, I can remind me why she's famous.

10:24.640 --> 10:31.560
I can have eight babies at once, but no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I want to be, I, I'm, I'm going

10:31.560 --> 10:37.080
for, um, I'm going for a certain, I'm going for Warhol famous because you either have

10:37.080 --> 10:40.440
to be slutty or rich, actually mostly slutty.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.160
I'm going to hire people to be me in public.

10:42.160 --> 10:51.560
You should have your own bra company, designer bras, designer bras, smiley faces over the

10:51.560 --> 10:52.560
boob or something.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.560
I don't know.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.200
I'm going to finish working on my cork.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.200
All right.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.200
Yes.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.200
Please.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
Let's go to a Loki with the, how was your gaming week?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.200
Loki?

11:00.200 --> 11:01.200
Um, it was all right.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
Didn't play a whole lot.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.560
Um, just some of the typical stuff like grand theft auto, of course, still playing some

11:05.560 --> 11:06.560
of that.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.120
This sucked the last few days.

11:08.120 --> 11:13.240
Uh, my coworkers have been out of the office for different reasons and so it's been very

11:13.240 --> 11:18.560
difficult to find a game and when I do get a game, everybody quits cause I kicked crap

11:18.560 --> 11:19.560
out of them.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.560
All right.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.560
Yes.

11:21.560 --> 11:22.560
Which is very disappointing.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.560
There's a little echo there.

11:23.560 --> 11:24.560
Sorry.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.680
And then, um, what else?

11:26.680 --> 11:27.680
New stuff.

11:27.680 --> 11:28.680
I've been playing.

11:28.680 --> 11:35.040
Um, I tried, uh, no more heroes paradise or whatever the hell it's called in Japan.

11:35.040 --> 11:40.000
It's the 360 port of no more heroes, the game on the Wii.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.720
And I got to say, I like it better on the 360 than on the Wii.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.440
Um, it just seemed easier for me to control.

11:46.440 --> 11:51.560
Granted, it's not as fun as, you know, slashing people to death, but, um, it is still pretty

11:51.560 --> 11:53.480
cool the way you do a lot of the moves.

11:53.480 --> 12:00.840
So, um, in place of, you know, swinging the Wii remote, you actually use the, um, uh,

12:00.840 --> 12:03.840
the right analog stick to do some of those moves.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.160
And same with the wrestling moves and stuff, except you use it with, uh, the left and right

12:07.160 --> 12:08.160
analog sticks.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.240
Um, but it actually works pretty cool.

12:10.240 --> 12:15.320
The only, uh, gripe I have about it is, um, I mean, the game itself is in English, uh,

12:15.320 --> 12:19.840
the dialogues in English, um, and you have the choice between English or Japanese dialogue.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.640
The problem is they did not sync up the, um, mouth movements to the English dialogue.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.440
It's only synced up to the Japanese dialogue.

12:26.440 --> 12:32.080
And I mean, it is way off for the English dialogue, but, uh, it's a fun game overall.

12:32.080 --> 12:37.800
And, I mean, I've played the original on the Wii, so it's kind of just, uh, rehashed stuff

12:37.800 --> 12:42.440
for me, but, um, I'm enjoying it quite a bit, so hopefully I'll be able to play my way through

12:42.440 --> 12:43.440
that.

12:43.440 --> 12:49.960
Um, and then I played a little bit on the arcade cabinet, broke out some Marvel vs.

12:49.960 --> 12:56.200
Capcom 2 and, uh, Capcom vs. SNK 2, so, uh, that was pretty fun.

12:56.200 --> 13:00.520
I'm sorry to derail you for a minute, Loki, because I do love Capcom vs. SNK as well,

13:00.520 --> 13:02.360
but I need to talk to Jamie for a minute.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.360
Is that glue?

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
Yes.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.360
That you're putting down there?

13:05.360 --> 13:06.360
Glue?

13:06.360 --> 13:07.360
Okay.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.360
Jamie's working on an art project.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.360
It's glue.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.360
Are you putting these pictures on the website, or is this a private thing?

13:10.360 --> 13:11.360
Yeah, I'm gonna do it on the website.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
Okay.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.760
So Jamie's working on an art project during the show, which is fine, but she's using a

13:14.760 --> 13:19.760
lot of glue, and I want to remind the listeners, we're in kind of an enclosed space here in

13:19.760 --> 13:20.760
the studio.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.760
It's not stinky glue.

13:21.760 --> 13:26.680
So we're all currently inhaling glue during this show, as if we weren't crazy enough.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.680
Right now.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.120
You have to be really close to glue.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.680
Back again in about 15 minutes, and see if all the-

13:31.680 --> 13:34.080
I've got it right under my nose, because I'm holding the damn mic.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
Great.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.080
Great.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.080
You of all people.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.880
And for the record, the stuff that I'm using is Mod Podge.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.920
And looks like a Yoplait yogurt container.

13:42.920 --> 13:43.920
It does.

13:43.920 --> 13:44.920
A little bit.

13:44.920 --> 13:45.920
But not safe for you.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.800
I was like, why are you rubbing yogurt on that?

13:47.800 --> 13:48.800
So weird.

13:48.800 --> 13:49.920
All right.

13:49.920 --> 13:55.120
Did you have anything else you wanted to say about your gaming week, Loki?

13:55.120 --> 13:56.760
Um, no.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.280
That's basically all I played this week.

13:58.280 --> 14:02.840
I wanted to go back to Final Fantasy 13, but I was talking to my friend who's actually

14:02.840 --> 14:04.560
at the same point in the game.

14:04.560 --> 14:11.040
Actually, his wife already finished Final Fantasy 13, and it's just kind of like...

14:11.040 --> 14:12.040
It sounds annoying.

14:12.040 --> 14:19.000
You know, he's like, ah, the ending sucked, and you know, you just put you back before

14:19.000 --> 14:23.360
the game's over, and you don't really get to see the results of your actions and that

14:23.360 --> 14:24.360
kind of stuff.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.200
So I'm like, eh, that sounds kind of disappointing.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.240
But I will finish it eventually, so I don't have to play it anymore.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.240
All right.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.640
That's kind of sad, because I mean, like, 10-2 had a freaking epic ending.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.240
Yeah, I'm curious to see what the ending...

14:35.240 --> 14:36.240
And 11 had no ending.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.480
Yeah, but you had to suffer through the whole game in order to see that ending.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.840
I will say, though, Final Fantasy related, speaking of 11 and all these other games,

14:41.840 --> 14:45.640
a lot of stuff is leaking out on 14, because the alpha's going on right now.

14:45.640 --> 14:49.200
So if you really know where to look, there's a lot of videos, and even the soundtrack.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.040
And I wish I'd brought it to the show with me tonight, but unfortunately I don't have

14:52.040 --> 14:53.040
it.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.040
I'll have to bring it next week.

14:54.040 --> 14:57.920
The alpha's leaked, and it looks really good.

14:57.920 --> 15:01.640
But it does look very 11-inspired, so if you didn't like 11, I don't know.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.360
We'll have to see when the game comes out for real, but it definitely looks interesting.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.160
All right, well, if Logie doesn't have anything else for his gaming week, I'll talk about

15:08.160 --> 15:12.120
my gaming week, which of course was a lot of wow, as usual.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.160
But I also played a brand new game that came out this week on Xbox Live Marketplace.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.760
That's right, Magic Sword Double Impact came out this week.

15:18.760 --> 15:22.800
I think actually they're selling it as another name, I think like Final Fight or some other

15:22.800 --> 15:24.240
game nobody played.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.600
But no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

15:26.600 --> 15:27.680
Love Final Fight.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.560
I just love Magic Sword more.

15:29.560 --> 15:37.500
So I was very excited to hear that the game was being re-put out basically on Xbox Live.

15:37.500 --> 15:43.480
And what I really like that they did with it is that they didn't make it just a freaking

15:43.480 --> 15:50.680
dump of the ROM onto the Marketplace with maybe some slightly enhanced graphics.

15:50.680 --> 15:55.280
Now sadly there aren't really enhanced graphics, like you're not going to get Bionic Commando

15:55.280 --> 16:00.880
Rearmed style graphics suddenly out of Final Fight or Magic Sword, but you do have different

16:00.880 --> 16:01.880
filters.

16:01.880 --> 16:05.820
In fact, there's this one very interesting, the default mode that you play, it tries to

16:05.820 --> 16:09.920
make the screen look like an old arcade screen.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.400
So like it has a curvature to it.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.880
It's very interesting the way they do it.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.160
And it looks awesome.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.800
I couldn't really play the game that way.

16:16.800 --> 16:22.640
I had to just put it in normal, ROM, no filter, just the way I remember it mode.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.200
Which is nice because that's there.

16:24.200 --> 16:28.600
So for the purists like me or whatever, elitists, whatever you want to call me, my mode is there.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.960
So that makes me happy.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.000
Remix soundtrack is there too.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.560
I believe it was the same team that did Bionic Commando.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
Don't quote me on that.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.880
One of the other recent Capcom games did that.

16:40.880 --> 16:46.460
So it has a remix soundtrack and of course Magic Sword, which I played mostly through

16:46.460 --> 16:49.640
the week, was just as great as I remember it many years ago.

16:49.640 --> 16:53.580
And if you've never played Magic Sword before, well first I should say Final Fight.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.960
It is the flagship game no matter if I think otherwise or not.

16:56.960 --> 17:02.440
Final Fight is one of those kind of beat-em-up type of games in the style of Double Dragon

17:02.440 --> 17:03.900
or Ninja Turtles.

17:03.900 --> 17:07.740
But I think Final Fight was, or Streets of Rage I guess if you will, but I think Final

17:07.740 --> 17:12.940
Fight was kind of known for just having a somewhat more memorable characters and some

17:12.940 --> 17:14.360
memorable story.

17:14.360 --> 17:19.680
And I think it was just kind of an iconic sort of arcade game that was out in the early

17:19.680 --> 17:20.680
90s.

17:20.680 --> 17:24.040
And I know Dark Soccer, myself, and probably Loki I'll remember from growing up in the

17:24.040 --> 17:25.040
pizza parlor and so forth.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.400
I actually have a Final Fight collection.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.080
I was collecting all of them until that really crappy one came out.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.520
But I have Mighty Final Fight and Final Fight Guy.

17:32.520 --> 17:37.080
It was one of those multi, and I believe, could you do three at once in the arcade?

17:37.080 --> 17:38.080
I can't remember.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.080
I can't remember.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.080
I think most cabinets were only two.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.080
You had three characters.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.080
Yeah, you had three characters, but I guess you could really only play two.

17:43.080 --> 17:48.200
But what I thought also was neat about both games is that there is a mode where you can

17:48.200 --> 17:51.880
have people, random people on the internet, just drop in at any time.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.560
Like walk up to the machine, put in a quarter basically, and drop into your game at any

17:54.560 --> 17:55.560
time.

17:55.560 --> 17:58.800
A la Street Fighter IV I guess you could say had a mode like that.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.760
But thankfully it's also very easy to turn that off.

18:01.760 --> 18:09.160
So again, I just say props to the team there at Capcom for not just dumping the ROMs and

18:09.160 --> 18:12.200
putting them out on the marketplace, but really kind of going back and touching them up.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.080
And did they redo the graphics?

18:14.080 --> 18:15.080
No.

18:15.080 --> 18:20.200
But you know, I think they were able to do a good port economically probably.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.080
This was probably a very economic port that they did, and they're probably going to make

18:24.080 --> 18:25.220
crap tons of money off of it.

18:25.220 --> 18:27.520
So props to Capcom.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.240
And I do approve, especially if you remember Magic Sword and Final Fight.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.440
I think the games are done very well.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.360
I don't think $10 is too much to ask for both games.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.200
I think there's a lot of people that are going to be kind of one or the other.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.200
I don't know.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.200
I'm a little bit of both.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.560
I joke that Magic Sword's better.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.520
I definitely fondly remember Final Fight.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.640
But if you never played these games growing up, at least check out the demo for heaven's

18:48.640 --> 18:49.640
sake.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.120
So there you go.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.120
Let's see.

18:53.120 --> 18:57.120
SalaciousPopInChat says something reminiscent of Magic Sword here.

18:57.120 --> 19:02.920
I recall spending three hours and at least $25 on Magic Sword with my BFF at the arcade

19:02.920 --> 19:07.720
and beating it from scratch and having my BFF take the dark orb at the end from the

19:07.720 --> 19:11.560
final boss instead of destroying it and becoming the new evil whatever.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.960
OMG spoiler!

19:12.960 --> 19:15.960
And my 15-year-old self was pissed and the credits rolled.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.000
I believe that's actually an achievement now.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.240
I believe if you actually take the dark orb at the end, that's the way you get one of

19:21.240 --> 19:22.240
the achievements.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.440
But yeah, you have to work there from the beginning.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.040
It's not like the Super Nintendo version that let you start on whatever floor you wanted

19:27.040 --> 19:28.040
to, basically.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.920
Because if you ever played the Super Nintendo one, which is a pretty faithful translation

19:30.920 --> 19:34.800
as was Final Fight, you could start on pretty much any floor.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.920
But not in this one.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.160
You have to start from the beginning.

19:37.160 --> 19:40.520
You can continue and you don't have to do it all in one sitting.

19:40.520 --> 19:41.920
So yeah, props to that.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.920
But that was really the only new, new game I played this week.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.600
Everything else is kind of something I've talked about before on the show.

19:46.600 --> 19:50.520
So that's going to do it for my gaming week.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.140
Getting into housekeeping a little bit before we start the gaming news tonight.

19:53.140 --> 19:55.240
Not a whole lot tonight for housekeeping.

19:55.240 --> 19:59.360
Just want to plug the Twitter and the Facebook, of course, twitter.com slash o-l-r and we're

19:59.360 --> 20:02.000
also on Facebook as well at Orange Lounge Radio.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.600
Please friend us or tell some of your friends to add us too.

20:05.600 --> 20:10.320
Help us spread the word about our little program because we can't afford to do commercials.

20:10.320 --> 20:14.040
Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.760
Loki's going to start us off with a little bit of gaming news.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.200
Actually a lot of gaming news surrounding one company, right?

20:19.200 --> 20:23.640
Well it's all kind of tying together and it's all very similar.

20:23.640 --> 20:28.600
So you may remember there was a little bit of suing and countersuing with Infinity Ward

20:28.600 --> 20:38.160
and or the ex-heads of Infinity Ward and of course Activision over some non-paid royalties.

20:38.160 --> 20:44.040
Well now they made an announcement that they are starting their own studio called Respawn

20:44.040 --> 20:47.000
Entertainment and they will be partnered with EA.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.360
So kind of almost that, you know, the whole thing was Activision was saying that they're

20:52.360 --> 20:59.040
going to go off and take their brand with them to their own studio, partnered with EA

20:59.040 --> 21:03.040
is sort of true but they're not really taking any brands with them, they're basically going

21:03.040 --> 21:07.460
to be doing brand new games, new franchises and that kind of stuff.

21:07.460 --> 21:13.360
So it's really neat and right now of course the only two members of this new studio are

21:13.360 --> 21:21.880
Jason West and Vince Zappanelli and they didn't really give any information other than the

21:21.880 --> 21:24.040
fact that they're hiring.

21:24.040 --> 21:29.160
They aren't, I don't believe, allowed to be hiring the ex-Infinity Ward people.

21:29.160 --> 21:33.280
Those guys have been leaving though, there's actually quite a few people leaving all throughout

21:33.280 --> 21:34.920
the week.

21:34.920 --> 21:45.760
Starting off, let's see, we had a few different developers or programmers.

21:45.760 --> 21:54.180
We had John Shiring and a senior animator, Bruce Fares, both confirmed that they're leaving

21:54.180 --> 22:01.800
Infinity Ward and then also the lead designer, Mackie McKendlish, has also left the company

22:01.800 --> 22:03.720
as well.

22:03.720 --> 22:11.760
There was also some other guys leaving, let's see, some more lead designers, Zeed Reek,

22:11.760 --> 22:20.880
Steve Fakuto, and some programmers, Rainn Wilson, or Winson, and, is it Rainn Wilson

22:20.880 --> 22:21.880
on The Office?

22:21.880 --> 22:30.920
No, Rainn Winson and Chris, looks like, Sharubi.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.340
And I guess he was another lead artist.

22:32.340 --> 22:37.860
So they've had a lot of different artists and stuff leaving and whatnot.

22:37.860 --> 22:45.280
And of course, to top it all off, Activision, there was one of the execs made a comment

22:45.280 --> 22:50.520
about the conditions that they provide for their studios.

22:50.520 --> 22:56.360
And according to Activision, because we have to believe them now, the chief operating and

22:56.360 --> 23:04.360
financial officer, Thomas Tipple, spoke to the LA Times company town blog, apparently

23:04.360 --> 23:08.880
this week, saying that a development house still has nearly 100 people, even though they

23:08.880 --> 23:17.680
lost about 10, they've built a deep bench and the change of guard will provide an opportunity

23:17.680 --> 23:23.500
for some of the rising stars to put their own stamp on the Call of Duty franchise.

23:23.500 --> 23:29.200
And then further, he says that we treat our developers extremely well.

23:29.200 --> 23:33.040
Independent Studio, or I continue, I guess, the Activision's Independent Studio model

23:33.040 --> 23:38.400
allows developers a lot of creative freedom while we take care of the back office stuff.

23:38.400 --> 23:42.400
Unfortunately, that's not exactly how they were painting the picture, so I don't really

23:42.400 --> 23:45.960
know if I'd believe all that.

23:45.960 --> 23:49.480
There's definitely a little bit of he-said, she-said going on.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.560
I think they just need to go on Tyra and work it out, honestly.

23:52.560 --> 23:53.560
Here's another thing.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.560
It's like a divorce.

23:54.560 --> 24:01.840
There was some comment saying that basically that the studio behind Modern Warfare is dead

24:01.840 --> 24:06.320
from one of the insiders, I guess, at Infinity Ward.

24:06.320 --> 24:10.140
His comment was, they're scared shitless.

24:10.140 --> 24:14.900
They never saw this coming, and he's referring to Activision, they can't believe what's going

24:14.900 --> 24:15.900
on.

24:15.900 --> 24:20.000
At first, they gave us some bullshit about moving up payments, all the money that they

24:20.000 --> 24:22.640
owed us to sooner increments.

24:22.640 --> 24:30.520
That was when the designer Todd Aldermen and engineer Frank Galletti left.

24:30.520 --> 24:33.820
But then the announcement of Respawn and then all the people leaving, they just got their

24:33.820 --> 24:38.200
heads in their hands.

24:38.200 --> 24:44.200
Basically he was also saying that apparently the morale's really low and that he thinks

24:44.200 --> 24:46.400
that the studio's going to continue to crumble.

24:46.400 --> 24:53.160
Although there was another insider, I guess, that's kind of painting a more positive picture.

24:53.160 --> 24:57.560
First off, yes, it's a shitty situation, but there's two kinds of people left.

24:57.560 --> 25:01.680
Ones that are sticking it out for the money and the others who want to make something

25:01.680 --> 25:02.760
work.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.760
We are not dead.

25:04.760 --> 25:08.280
We definitely lost the original team members, but not all the talent.

25:08.280 --> 25:12.140
When you talk about people who left, they are the best in the business, but equally

25:12.140 --> 25:15.100
everyone in Infinity Ward deserves that same credential.

25:15.100 --> 25:21.420
We are here for the long haul of keeping Modern Warfare name alive, but as the article clearly

25:21.420 --> 25:24.640
shows, certain people are still pissed about it.

25:24.640 --> 25:27.420
We just had a discussion in our Monday meeting.

25:27.420 --> 25:31.600
We still have talent that will get us to where we need to go, and now it's time to find our

25:31.600 --> 25:33.680
new leader.

25:33.680 --> 25:40.040
You know how I'd like to see this whole thing resolved?

25:40.040 --> 25:47.040
How?

25:47.040 --> 25:50.120
This is the play tip.

25:50.120 --> 25:54.680
Bobby Kotek, CEO of an Evil Empire video game company.

25:54.680 --> 26:00.440
He's accused of being a douchebag who doesn't know how to run his studios, but he says he

26:00.440 --> 26:03.240
knows how to run them just fine and gives them the perfect environment to make games

26:03.240 --> 26:04.240
in.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.240
Wait, didn't he be the defendant?

26:05.240 --> 26:06.240
Oh yeah, he'd be the defendant.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.240
Ah, I screwed it all up.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.240
Never mind.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.240
That's why I'm not a lawyer.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.240
I'm just, I'm Shmo on a video game show.

26:10.240 --> 26:14.680
But no, I mean, this is all, it's very interesting how this is all playing out in public.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.120
Yeah, um, I, I don't know.

26:19.120 --> 26:23.040
The problem I see is, you know, they're saying one, well Activision's saying one thing, how

26:23.040 --> 26:26.080
they, you know, give their studios creative freedom and stuff.

26:26.080 --> 26:30.080
And then at the same time we see the Call of Duty franchise split between three studios

26:30.080 --> 26:31.080
now.

26:31.080 --> 26:35.240
And the, you know, all this, the reasoning why they wanted to leave, or I guess were

26:35.240 --> 26:39.960
made to leave, is because they wouldn't, you know, they didn't have that creative freedom

26:39.960 --> 26:44.640
and they refused to, I guess, go along with what their plans were.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.680
So I don't know.

26:47.680 --> 26:53.400
It just sounds like a big mess and unfortunately, I think Activision might suffer a little bit

26:53.400 --> 26:56.320
for it.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.200
Tiger Claw says this needs the law and order gavel.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.760
There you go.

27:03.760 --> 27:11.080
Um, I don't know, I, I saw a video a couple days ago and I, I thought you were gonna get

27:11.080 --> 27:14.920
to it, but I guess maybe you didn't see it, that showed this, the credits of Infinity

27:14.920 --> 27:19.220
Ward and it just shows how the red lines through all the people that have left.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.100
And while there does seem to be quite a few people that are still there, it's like kind

27:22.100 --> 27:26.560
of like a lot of the testers and sort of the, like, I hate to use insulting words, but kind

27:26.560 --> 27:30.840
of like the lower entry level positions seem to mostly be the ones that are still there.

27:30.840 --> 27:35.440
And then like most of the higher up, so are like out and you got to really wonder what

27:35.440 --> 27:36.640
the longterm impact is going to be.

27:36.640 --> 27:40.520
I mean, you know, Modern Warfare 2 is a huge game and whereas, you know, I'm sure they'll

27:40.520 --> 27:45.160
be, I mean, they got, Activision got another studio to make Guitar Hero 3.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.160
Well let me put it this way.

27:46.160 --> 27:49.320
So somebody else will do Modern Warfare, but it's definitely going to be different.

27:49.320 --> 27:52.960
Yeah, they're going to still have Call of Duty games, I mean, look at World of War.

27:52.960 --> 27:57.680
Yeah, it didn't sell as well as Modern Warfare did, but it still sold really well and that's

27:57.680 --> 27:58.920
Treyarch for you.

27:58.920 --> 28:03.320
They're going to give it to Treyarch and then whoever the hell this new company is, um,

28:03.320 --> 28:07.040
they're going to kind of split it up and fortunately it's never going to be as good, I guess, as

28:07.040 --> 28:08.920
the Infinity Ward games.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.320
And you may still see, you know, Infinity Ward continue on, but I have a feeling there's

28:12.320 --> 28:15.560
going to be a lot more people leaving and especially if they drag this out long enough

28:15.560 --> 28:20.440
and not, and they are not paying their employees, you know, the royalties that are due, you'll

28:20.440 --> 28:23.720
probably see a lot of these people that are, you know, kind of sticking out, start to question

28:23.720 --> 28:25.720
whether they're going to leave or not.

28:25.720 --> 28:30.880
So I have a feeling this is just going to keep on going.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.880
It's going to be very interesting to see, uh, what kind of game comes out this Christmas

28:34.880 --> 28:36.560
if there is a Modern Warfare game at all.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.520
I imagine there's got to be, but I'm just interested to see what, how it's going to

28:39.520 --> 28:40.520
be different.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.640
You know, it's just going to be another Call of Duty game.

28:41.640 --> 28:44.080
I thought they were working on a Vietnam one or something like that.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.080
Hmm.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.080
Oh yeah, that's right.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.080
Cause every other year, huh?

28:47.080 --> 28:48.080
Yeah.

28:48.080 --> 28:51.480
And all they're going to do is just use the same engine that, um, Infinity Ward created,

28:51.480 --> 28:54.240
but Treyarch will be the one putting together the game.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.440
So it'll be another World of War.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.520
And what happens to the, uh, former employees?

28:58.520 --> 29:01.720
Do you think some of them are banding together to form a new studio and what will they make

29:01.720 --> 29:02.720
games like?

29:02.720 --> 29:06.600
Um, actually the people they're leaving are not going to that Respawn Entertainment.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.440
I think mainly because it's part of the closet.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.960
They can't hire those people.

29:10.960 --> 29:11.960
Oh.

29:11.960 --> 29:16.840
Um, you know, right now it's a non-compete thing, but it's got to be good on the resume.

29:16.840 --> 29:22.160
I worked on the greatest selling fucking video game of the past few years, you know, that

29:22.160 --> 29:29.160
and the fact that non-compete clauses in California actually I don't think are valid from what

29:29.160 --> 29:30.160
I've read.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.160
So.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.160
Interesting.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.760
I'm not, um, certainly I'm not a lawyer.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.880
I can't even tell the difference between a plaintiff and a defendant, but I mean, there's

29:36.880 --> 29:38.960
a lot of development studios in like Canada and stuff.

29:38.960 --> 29:43.280
I mean, would that water if they, I don't know, but up north, we'll find out what's

29:43.280 --> 29:44.280
going to happen.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.960
They'll just all play on doing the accusation.

29:45.960 --> 29:52.280
I know that I was just, I was ad libbing earlier when he ad lib, you say stupid things sometimes.

29:52.280 --> 29:58.200
So anyhow, but yes, the plaintiff is the one doing the suing and the defendant is the one

29:58.200 --> 30:01.800
that, not that I've ever had to be a plaintiff or defendant, but I did.

30:01.800 --> 30:06.080
I was on a jury once years ago and, and it was, it definitely played out like an episode

30:06.080 --> 30:07.080
of law and order.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.240
It was, uh, it was interesting.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.240
Anyhow, plaintiff.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.240
No, no, no, no, no.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.880
I was thinking of Jay.

30:15.880 --> 30:16.880
All right.

30:16.880 --> 30:22.080
Look, uh, moving on to other stories that, uh, have a little less to do with, um, the

30:22.080 --> 30:25.520
shakeups and so forth, but a little more, well actually no, this, this is about a different

30:25.520 --> 30:27.840
type of shakeup and very much about television.

30:27.840 --> 30:31.720
Um, I'm sure a lot of you guys that listen to this program also kind of follow a lot

30:31.720 --> 30:35.160
of the other type of, um, you know, nerdy news, if you will, on the internet.

30:35.160 --> 30:38.840
And I'm sure a lot of you are big fans of Conan O'Brien, um, although there's probably

30:38.840 --> 30:42.120
some of you that, that dish out the haterade when it comes to Conan O'Brien as well.

30:42.120 --> 30:46.680
So love him or hate him, Conan O'Brien of course found a new home this week on TBS and

30:46.680 --> 30:49.680
ironically going to be bumping George Lopez back an hour.

30:49.680 --> 30:50.680
It was his idea.

30:50.680 --> 30:51.680
Yes.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.280
But, but the difference is George Lopez was like, no, no, I want you to do that.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.500
I would be better off with you coming over here.

30:57.500 --> 31:01.480
So cool beans, Conan O'Brien will be back on TV for those that like him and for those

31:01.480 --> 31:03.860
that don't, then you can watch whatever you want.

31:03.860 --> 31:07.480
But the interesting part about this, I mean that part doesn't have anything to do with

31:07.480 --> 31:12.460
video games, but now more, now that a deal has been signed, more news is coming out about

31:12.460 --> 31:15.880
some of the other deals that were presented to Conan.

31:15.880 --> 31:22.560
Cause of course when he left NBC, it really seemed like everybody, but like CBS and ABC

31:22.560 --> 31:26.740
was throwing something at him because obviously CBS, ABC have their own lineups, but everybody

31:26.740 --> 31:27.740
was throwing something at him.

31:27.740 --> 31:29.760
We all know Fox was in negotiations.

31:29.760 --> 31:34.180
I think they came out and said, um, one of the other TV stations was, was in talks with

31:34.180 --> 31:35.280
him as well.

31:35.280 --> 31:41.480
But what is very interesting as well, um, team Conan was thinking actually of one idea

31:41.480 --> 31:43.800
way outside the network box.

31:43.800 --> 31:49.680
There was actually discussions with Microsoft about an Xbox deal for Conan show that would

31:49.680 --> 31:52.240
have broken new ground.

31:52.240 --> 31:56.000
Now they don't obviously say a lot of specifics about what that deal would have entailed,

31:56.000 --> 32:01.680
but you can sort of connect the dots here and think about, okay, well we all know Xbox

32:01.680 --> 32:04.880
sells TV shows, if you will, I mean that's part of the business they're in.

32:04.880 --> 32:09.760
They sell movies and TV shows and we've seen what's happened over at Sony's camp with the

32:09.760 --> 32:15.560
tester show, which by the way recently ended and I stopped watching it halfway through

32:15.560 --> 32:17.760
and had it spoiled for me on the internet who won.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.840
But if you watched even the first episode of the show, you could see who was going to

32:20.840 --> 32:22.640
win that show coming from a mile away.

32:22.640 --> 32:26.400
But anyway, that's not the point, despite the fact whether the tester was a good or

32:26.400 --> 32:28.680
bad show, whatever your opinion is on that.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.560
It did set this really interesting precedent and I said this a few weeks ago when I first

32:32.560 --> 32:37.440
reviewed the show is that, okay, maybe the tester is a little bit of a wonky show, but

32:37.440 --> 32:42.720
it's still fascinating that there is this budget, there is money, there is drive, there

32:42.720 --> 32:48.040
are embedded commercials and there's ways to make money off direct to PlayStation network

32:48.040 --> 32:51.000
types of TV shows.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.520
And even though the tester might be weird, it's really interesting to see what could

32:54.520 --> 32:56.960
maybe come next out of this.

32:56.960 --> 33:01.080
Well, you now look at what you hear about what's going on over with Microsoft and the

33:01.080 --> 33:06.400
deal they offered and you could kind of think maybe Microsoft was going to do some type

33:06.400 --> 33:12.680
of free show or ad supported show or who knows, maybe they would have sold certain types of

33:12.680 --> 33:17.840
the formats of the show or whatever of Conan O'Brien like every night.

33:17.840 --> 33:23.640
What's also interesting, and when I was first telling a friend of mine about this, he said,

33:23.640 --> 33:30.100
is this maybe like one versus a hundred was on Xbox?

33:30.100 --> 33:33.120
And I was thinking, well, that would be really interesting too, is that what if the whole

33:33.120 --> 33:38.040
show had actually played out live on Xbox network and you could watch the show live?

33:38.040 --> 33:42.800
I mean, if you think about it, Microsoft has the bandwidth to make something like that

33:42.800 --> 33:45.520
happen and they have the resources to do it.

33:45.520 --> 33:50.160
I mean, isn't it really only a matter of time before you could get live television through

33:50.160 --> 33:51.160
your Xbox?

33:51.160 --> 33:52.160
I mean, Netflix and everything.

33:52.160 --> 33:58.840
And it makes sense because a lot more people are playing games versus watching TV.

33:58.840 --> 34:03.680
Even though the Conan O'Brien deal fell through or whatever and Conan decided to go with,

34:03.680 --> 34:06.480
you know, I want to say traditional TV, but that's not really the case.

34:06.480 --> 34:10.520
He went with basic cable, but still, you know, a more traditional type of format.

34:10.520 --> 34:15.000
It's very interesting to see that, okay, well, Microsoft's pursuing these types of ideas

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
then.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.640
So what might happen in the next year or so?

34:19.640 --> 34:22.360
Is it possible we're going to see a live interactive talk show?

34:22.360 --> 34:25.600
I think that would be a very logical place for Microsoft to go.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.560
Can you imagine, let's take the nerd angle on it.

34:28.560 --> 34:33.520
Instead of something more like late show type of programming, what if Xbox had a program

34:33.520 --> 34:36.400
like the screen savers?

34:36.400 --> 34:42.880
And I'm not talking what it turned into years later, but old school Leo Laporte, tech TV

34:42.880 --> 34:46.720
screen savers that was interactive with the Xbox audience.

34:46.720 --> 34:51.760
Here's my problem with that and it's just, and it goes for anything even on like the

34:51.760 --> 34:54.160
PlayStation Network or Wii or whatever.

34:54.160 --> 34:59.520
Any of those shows are going to be obviously biased towards one console platform and it

34:59.520 --> 35:05.160
just to me would seem like someone just shoving an advertisement in my face.

35:05.160 --> 35:09.120
You know, basically that's how I even look at like the tester and stuff.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.120
Oh, okay.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.560
It's a giant commercial for your fucking games.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
Awesome.

35:13.560 --> 35:20.400
You know, same with the, you know, I didn't think, you know, and I got to give the tester

35:20.400 --> 35:21.400
credit.

35:21.400 --> 35:25.520
I mean, yeah, the show had flaws and had plenty of flaws, but it wasn't terrible.

35:25.520 --> 35:31.540
I think a lot of people judge that show without ever watching it for even five minutes.

35:31.540 --> 35:34.760
And I'll tell you what, the production values on the show were not terrible.

35:34.760 --> 35:35.760
Could it have been better?

35:35.760 --> 35:36.760
Yes.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.040
But what is it like the worst thing that ever happened to PlayStation Network?

35:39.040 --> 35:40.180
Not at all.

35:40.180 --> 35:44.920
In fact, it does set an interesting precedent where, okay, it is viable.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.880
They embedded commercials in the show.

35:46.880 --> 35:50.440
Granted, you could fast forward them, but I bet there's a way they could get around

35:50.440 --> 35:51.440
that.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.880
I mean, they embedded commercials in the content.

35:52.880 --> 35:57.520
I mean, yeah, Loki, it was kind of a commercial for some of the games and it's more of, I

35:57.520 --> 36:00.440
would say it's more of like a Sony product, whatever.

36:00.440 --> 36:04.240
But doesn't Microsoft kind of do the same thing when they, whenever they do their Major

36:04.240 --> 36:08.940
Nelson at PAX East, they're showing crackdown, they're showing the Microsoft stuff.

36:08.940 --> 36:14.140
They're not going to say, hey, we were at PAX East this week and oh, APB is here.

36:14.140 --> 36:17.940
You don't really see that on the Microsoft content.

36:17.940 --> 36:18.940
You know what I mean?

36:18.940 --> 36:20.960
You do expect there's going to be that certain type of synergy.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.360
And I don't know, watching the tester, I didn't feel like the game stuff was shoved down my

36:24.360 --> 36:25.360
throat.

36:25.360 --> 36:32.760
I kind of felt like, okay, I'm watching a show about video game testers or whatever.

36:32.760 --> 36:36.560
And you know, you kind of expect there's going to be video games involved and I'm not suddenly

36:36.560 --> 36:41.040
going to see them playing the Nintendo Wii on a Sony PlayStation show.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.040
Right?

36:42.040 --> 36:43.040
Yeah.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.040
So.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.040
But that's my point though.

36:45.040 --> 36:50.120
I mean, it's just, I don't know, I mean, I guess if you want, you know, product stuff

36:50.120 --> 36:56.200
shoved into your face and you're going to subscribe to their online magazine, but it's

36:56.200 --> 37:01.180
just, I don't really want to see that now if they actually brought the screensavers

37:01.180 --> 37:06.280
as the screensavers were to the network, then yeah, that would be fine.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.120
But it's not going to be that way.

37:09.120 --> 37:14.420
It's going to be kind of biased and that's not something I'm really interested in.

37:14.420 --> 37:18.440
I see what you're saying, because there would be an Xbox or a Microsoft centric spin on

37:18.440 --> 37:19.440
it.

37:19.440 --> 37:22.720
You're not going to see Macs and things like that on the Xbox screensavers.

37:22.720 --> 37:28.840
Because it wouldn't be like, yeah, I bought my 360 and it died four days later, you know.

37:28.840 --> 37:32.320
You know, come to think of it, sorry to cut you off, but doesn't Microsoft kind of have,

37:32.320 --> 37:36.240
I mean, I think of, and I don't know if this is still around, but I'm thinking, okay,

37:36.240 --> 37:41.240
because we're sort of relatives, we're like distant cousins of this, okay?

37:41.240 --> 37:44.120
So All Games Network is the network we're on, right?

37:44.120 --> 37:47.520
Who is run by Scott Rubin, right?

37:47.520 --> 37:51.680
And Scott used to be on a TV show on G4 called G4 TV, right?

37:51.680 --> 37:53.840
I'm playing like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon here, right?

37:53.840 --> 37:54.840
Okay.

37:54.840 --> 38:01.720
Scott hosted with, Laura Foy was one and the other girl was Tina, not, I keep wanting to

38:01.720 --> 38:05.500
say Tina Fey, but it's not that, it's, oh gosh, I'm going to, I'm going to get yelled

38:05.500 --> 38:10.320
at by the chat room for not knowing this, but these two gals hosted the show with Scott.

38:10.320 --> 38:16.640
After the G4 TV thing folded, that show, they went on to do some Microsoft centric show,

38:16.640 --> 38:19.160
like 10 something it was called.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.100
I know there's going to be, there's people that have listened to allgames.com for years

38:23.100 --> 38:26.640
that are going to jump in here and yell what it is in our chat room at chat.com.

38:26.640 --> 38:31.120
But Microsoft is doing a show like that, or was at one time, like they did these little

38:31.120 --> 38:32.120
specials.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.120
Tina Wood.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.120
Thank you, Tina Wood.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.840
And they were doing these little specials for some time that weren't available on Xbox

38:37.840 --> 38:41.040
per se, but it was on like Microsoft's website and they were all about like, you know, fun

38:41.040 --> 38:46.800
features of Microsoft and going out to the, you know, uh, shows and so forth and showing

38:46.800 --> 38:48.200
what's going on.

38:48.200 --> 38:52.520
Because another point I just wanted to say, if there was a Conan centric show on Xbox

38:52.520 --> 38:56.040
or what have you, I don't think it would be restricted to just Xbox.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.320
I think there'd be a way to get it on your Zune.

38:58.320 --> 39:01.600
There'd be a way to get it on your Windows mobile phone and there'd be ways to get it

39:01.600 --> 39:06.240
on your desktop computer, but the technology is certainly there.

39:06.240 --> 39:07.240
Yeah.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.240
There you go.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.240
On 10.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.240
Thank you.

39:11.240 --> 39:14.320
See, I knew, I knew that there's a lot of people listen to us because of the all games

39:14.320 --> 39:16.200
connection and how we kind of joined up with that.

39:16.200 --> 39:20.920
So I knew some of them have been following, uh, Scott and the old G4 family for years.

39:20.920 --> 39:25.620
And yeah, uh, Tiger Claw reminds us, uh, uh, uh, Diane Mazzotta from the old G4 TV days

39:25.620 --> 39:30.520
is now on Scott's new show, the Apidae TV, which I watched the iPad special.

39:30.520 --> 39:33.480
It was a pretty good every day though.

39:33.480 --> 39:37.680
That's, that's going to be a lot of work, app a day, one app a day, an app a day keeps

39:37.680 --> 39:40.040
the, uh, Microsoft away, a doctor away.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.040
I don't know.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.040
All right.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.040
Anyhow.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.400
Um, so I think it's very interesting.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.400
This whole Conan thing.

39:45.400 --> 39:50.760
I mean, I can see why it didn't work out, but it does kind of leave a very interesting

39:50.760 --> 39:54.680
door open to what might happen in the future.

39:54.680 --> 40:00.480
So we'll see anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.480
Dark Sakura.

40:01.480 --> 40:02.480
Why don't we?

40:02.480 --> 40:07.320
Um, you know, we brought up, uh, Final Fight Double Impact earlier, or I'm sorry, Magic

40:07.320 --> 40:12.440
Sword Double Impact, Rob, and, um, well the soundtrack is available.

40:12.440 --> 40:22.340
You can download, um, the, uh, the remix soundtrack, um, as done by Simon Viklund, um, the guy

40:22.340 --> 40:26.040
who also did the score for Bionic Commando Rearmed.

40:26.040 --> 40:33.120
Um, I will be, um, of course linking, uh, that in the chatroom, but you can also find

40:33.120 --> 40:38.320
it at FinalFightGame.com slash remix.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.500
So go, go get it.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.000
Love Final Fight music.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.120
I also think it's pretty cool that he's just putting it up there for free.

40:47.120 --> 40:51.280
I like that these video game companies are, uh, putting up soundtracks for free, but they're

40:51.280 --> 40:54.120
not the only ones, right Dark Sakura?

40:54.120 --> 40:57.000
Uh, don't think so.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Let's see.

40:58.000 --> 41:03.880
Um, yeah, also the God of War trilogy, um, soundtrack is available.

41:03.880 --> 41:08.160
And uh, of course, uh, I think that's pretty cool that Sony's doing that for God of War

41:08.160 --> 41:09.160
3.

41:09.160 --> 41:13.320
Um, actually I'm sorry, the whole trilogy, if I'm right.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.320
I think so.

41:14.320 --> 41:18.560
It's the whole, and God of War is one where they could probably sell it if they wanted

41:18.560 --> 41:19.560
to.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
They did.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.560
They did?

41:21.560 --> 41:22.560
Yeah.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.560
They're giving it away for free?

41:23.560 --> 41:24.560
For God of War 3.

41:24.560 --> 41:25.560
Oh, interesting.

41:25.560 --> 41:26.560
Huh.

41:26.560 --> 41:32.700
But yeah, um, you can actually just go to God of War dot com and I think that it's available,

41:32.700 --> 41:34.040
um, on the website.

41:34.040 --> 41:38.200
I'd be more interested in a dump of the, um, heavy metal soundtrack that they had for,

41:38.200 --> 41:39.600
uh, God of War 3.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.520
I'm kinda surprised we don't see more game soundtracks out there.

41:42.520 --> 41:43.740
I mean, not necessarily for free.

41:43.740 --> 41:45.400
The Blood and Metal EP?

41:45.400 --> 41:48.520
But you know, I'm talking about, like, even on iTunes.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.960
And there, well, I should say that I have seen, there's definitely been an increase

41:51.960 --> 41:56.000
of game soundtracks available on iTunes, but you know, one of these game soundtracks are

41:56.000 --> 41:59.800
really just promotion for the game at the end of the day, so why not give them out for

41:59.800 --> 42:00.800
free?

42:00.800 --> 42:01.800
Well, I linked it in the chatroom too.

42:01.800 --> 42:02.800
There you go.

42:02.800 --> 42:03.800
Good job.

42:03.800 --> 42:08.080
Um, also, uh, just wanted to say real quick, uh, we had a little bit of stream downtime.

42:08.080 --> 42:09.080
I don't know.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.080
We had a stream hiccup that happened.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.980
We just kept right on rolling the tape, but, uh, our live listeners are just now coming

42:12.980 --> 42:17.720
back on and, uh, there's some, uh, chat comments from before the hiccup and I wanted to get

42:17.720 --> 42:18.720
to some of these.

42:18.720 --> 42:22.320
Uh, Black Wolf in our chatroom, of course, the one and only Bobby Black Wolf who tapes

42:22.320 --> 42:26.280
before us at All Games Radio, he said, I wanted to point out that some of the on 10 stuff

42:26.280 --> 42:30.720
from E3 2007 actually showed people playing Wii games.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.600
I was surprised.

42:32.600 --> 42:36.160
Does that maybe play into the, and I don't want to, maybe I shouldn't go back and open

42:36.160 --> 42:40.520
this old can of worms, but does that maybe play into the whole, uh, conspiracy theory

42:40.520 --> 42:45.640
from about three years ago before the Wii really took off on OMG, Microsoft wants to

42:45.640 --> 42:46.640
buy Nintendo?

42:46.640 --> 42:52.240
Like that, like, and, and also hasn't they had, didn't they say at one point that maybe

42:52.240 --> 42:57.160
it was Nintendo that said this, I don't know, but somebody said that Microsoft is competing

42:57.160 --> 42:58.720
with Sony, not Nintendo.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.720
Yeah.

42:59.720 --> 43:04.360
So maybe, you know, showing a Wii game is okay, but showing a PS3 game, not okay.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.520
And I could see that.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.280
I don't know.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.280
Anyway.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.280
Sorry.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.480
I just want to say that now.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.480
I didn't want to.

43:11.480 --> 43:12.480
Yeah.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.480
Really?

43:13.480 --> 43:14.480
Yeah.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.520
Now that Natal's coming out, they probably won't be showing those a week clips anymore

43:15.520 --> 43:17.880
because now they are a little bit more of a competitor.

43:17.880 --> 43:18.880
We'll see.

43:18.880 --> 43:21.160
Anyway, for the live listeners, we'll play some of the songs from those soundtracks a

43:21.160 --> 43:23.300
little later on during our break.

43:23.300 --> 43:26.360
For those of you listening on the podcast, you will have to go grab those at the URLs.

43:26.360 --> 43:27.840
Dark Sakura already gave you.

43:27.840 --> 43:28.840
Yep.

43:28.840 --> 43:29.840
Go get them.

43:29.840 --> 43:30.840
All right.

43:30.840 --> 43:37.200
Well, um, in case you're wondering, the, um, teased Nintendo 3DS is going to be Nintendo's

43:37.200 --> 43:41.680
next platform, not necessarily just a revision of the current hardware.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.160
It is actually going to be a brand new platform.

43:44.160 --> 43:48.160
And that makes sense considering some of the stories we've talked about, the 3DS or stuff

43:48.160 --> 43:54.040
that could possibly lend itself to the 3DS, like for example, the patent that was registered,

43:54.040 --> 43:59.500
I believe last week for some sort of rumble device built into the new DS.

43:59.500 --> 44:04.800
And of course, you know, the fact that the 3DS is going to be in 3D, um, obviously it's

44:04.800 --> 44:10.760
going to be probably backwards compatible with, um, the DSI stuff or the Nintendo DS

44:10.760 --> 44:11.760
stuff.

44:11.760 --> 44:15.280
Um, so yeah, that makes sense, but that's kind of neat.

44:15.280 --> 44:18.480
So new platform finally for the handhelds.

44:18.480 --> 44:23.440
Um, so in other words, it's not just a DS upgrade.

44:23.440 --> 44:26.800
It's a brand new, it is a new thing.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.600
Basically they're saying that we've run out of ideas for new games.

44:29.600 --> 44:35.720
So now we're going to put out a new Mario game and a new, uh, you know, I, I ha I will

44:35.720 --> 44:38.160
say though, I, my interest is piqued with this.

44:38.160 --> 44:43.080
I am very curious to see how this plays out because I am, I'm not big on the 3D thing.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.160
I think it's a little ridiculous for some of the movies.

44:45.160 --> 44:50.160
I mean, yes, avatar was, was pretty, but I mean, honestly the 3D gave me a headache.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.720
I think I would have enjoyed avatar just as much in 2D.

44:52.720 --> 44:53.720
That's what I'm saying.

44:53.720 --> 44:54.720
I mean, was it pretty?

44:54.720 --> 44:55.720
Yeah.

44:55.720 --> 44:56.720
But would I have enjoyed it just as much in 2D?

44:56.720 --> 44:57.720
Of course I would have.

44:57.720 --> 45:03.640
Um, so I'm kind of curious if games are really going to make me feel differently about 3D.

45:03.640 --> 45:06.640
You know, I think I'd pick up the system one step closer to the holodeck.

45:06.640 --> 45:11.440
I, I think it'd be interesting cause I like the fact that it doesn't require, um, glasses

45:11.440 --> 45:13.120
to play it, which is kind of cool.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.560
Yeah, that is very interesting.

45:14.560 --> 45:19.560
And really to be honest with like the 3D TVs and stuff that they're shown on TV, um, I'm

45:19.560 --> 45:23.040
not really interested in that stuff because those glasses are so damn expensive.

45:23.040 --> 45:28.320
I think the best system out there that they should really go with, and I'm very surprised

45:28.320 --> 45:32.720
that they're just going with the actual shutter glasses and stuff, is that real D3D.

45:32.720 --> 45:35.080
Cause those glasses are fucking dirt cheap.

45:35.080 --> 45:40.640
I mean, they hand them out for like five bucks when you go see a 3D movie, and it works just

45:40.640 --> 45:42.920
as well as those shutter glasses.

45:42.920 --> 45:46.800
So if they can come up with a TV that supports that, I think that'd be the way to go cause

45:46.800 --> 45:52.640
hell, I mean, you don't have enough for your friends or something, just go buy a pack of

45:52.640 --> 45:54.760
ten for like, you know, twenty bucks or something.

45:54.760 --> 45:56.760
I don't know.

45:56.760 --> 46:01.120
Um, it's kind of funny, Sega in our chatroom says, holodeck missed.

46:01.120 --> 46:04.080
And if you're new to the show and you've never heard me kind of say, oh, we're one step closer

46:04.080 --> 46:05.360
to the holodeck.

46:05.360 --> 46:09.760
Every time we hear about this new invention in games or the next, you know, generation

46:09.760 --> 46:12.680
of games, cause you know, the show's been on a little while now, when our show started

46:12.680 --> 46:15.240
the PlayStation 2 was still new, okay?

46:15.240 --> 46:18.340
Whenever these new things are announced, it's always kind of like joking, well, we're one

46:18.340 --> 46:23.140
step closer to the holodeck, which from Star Trek The Next Generation was, you know, there

46:23.140 --> 46:29.820
is no, you basically were in the environment you wanted to be in or play your game or simulation

46:29.820 --> 46:30.820
in.

46:30.820 --> 46:34.520
And I kind of think the one thing I could see that could be very cool about 3D is that,

46:34.520 --> 46:38.440
like, well, I don't even know if cool is the word I would use, but can you imagine, like,

46:38.440 --> 46:43.960
a, not so much on the DS, but like on a big console, a big TV, a 3D version of like Silent

46:43.960 --> 46:44.960
Hill?

46:44.960 --> 46:46.720
Like, I don't even know if I could play a game like that.

46:46.720 --> 46:50.320
I think it just might be too much for me, like sensory overload, you know?

46:50.320 --> 46:55.880
All I have to do is make this technology affordable, cause if that system comes out at $200, that's

46:55.880 --> 46:56.880
not gonna work.

46:56.880 --> 47:01.920
A game like Myst could be, I mean, the reason why I read that quote is because Myst, I don't

47:01.920 --> 47:07.160
know, there's a creepiness to Myst, but not like scary.

47:07.160 --> 47:10.320
There's just certain, like, I don't know, I played Myst online for a couple weeks.

47:10.320 --> 47:13.120
I'd want holodeck phantasmagoria.

47:13.120 --> 47:14.120
You're sick.

47:14.120 --> 47:17.760
But there's a certain creepiness to it without being, like, just downright scary.

47:17.760 --> 47:20.960
Can you imagine 3DF0?

47:20.960 --> 47:22.880
I'd barf.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.880
Like 3DF0 moves, would move very quickly.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.160
F0 is a very fast-moving game.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.160
I'd probably barf.

47:29.160 --> 47:30.600
I think it might be too much.

47:30.600 --> 47:34.840
Here's what I'm surprised, and, you know, we may see this later on, is...

47:34.840 --> 47:40.000
Sorry, Tigerclaw in our chatroom, chat.ornsonshade.com says, eh, people will just play WoW and realistic

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
3D.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
True.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.640
It's like arcade games with this kind of technology built in, cause it's just an LCD screen with

47:45.640 --> 47:50.240
some sort of, you know, extra screen in front of it that directs the light to your eyes.

47:50.240 --> 47:54.040
You know, that'd be perfect because, like, especially sit-down racing games and stuff,

47:54.040 --> 47:57.080
you're obviously at a certain distance away from the screen that they could calibrate

47:57.080 --> 47:58.920
it to, and there you go.

47:58.920 --> 48:01.720
Yeah, but arcade games, I mean...

48:01.720 --> 48:02.720
But yeah, but...

48:02.720 --> 48:06.480
I don't mean to jump ahead, but I know we have a story coming up later about arcades

48:06.480 --> 48:09.360
further on the decline, and it's kinda like...

48:09.360 --> 48:10.360
I don't know.

48:10.360 --> 48:11.360
That's a lot of money.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.280
But that's the thing though, but the arcade games, yeah, they're not releasing a lot of

48:14.280 --> 48:17.600
stuff, but the stuff that they are releasing are, like, the big things that you can't do

48:17.600 --> 48:18.600
at home type stuff.

48:18.600 --> 48:19.600
I see.

48:19.600 --> 48:23.740
You know, like the, you know, full-scale racing sims and stuff like that.

48:23.740 --> 48:28.260
But just, this would take it one step further, and that would be awesome.

48:28.260 --> 48:30.360
So like 3D Mario Kart in the arcade?

48:30.360 --> 48:31.360
Exactly.

48:31.360 --> 48:32.360
Good times.

48:32.360 --> 48:33.360
All right.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.800
Well, I was talking about sensory overload, and that kinda ties into the next story, and

48:36.800 --> 48:41.040
it's about this study that was conducted by Australian researchers.

48:41.040 --> 48:45.440
And what they're trying to do is kinda refute the claim that if you play violent video games

48:45.440 --> 48:48.680
before you go to bed, you're gonna have a hard time falling asleep.

48:48.680 --> 48:49.880
So what they did is they did this study.

48:49.880 --> 48:54.360
They took two groups of teenage boys, sorry, no girls allowed apparently in this study,

48:54.360 --> 48:58.640
and they made them play 50 minutes of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, or I'm sorry, Call

48:58.640 --> 49:00.160
of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.

49:00.160 --> 49:05.480
They split them into two groups, and one group played Call of Duty 4, the other group watched

49:05.480 --> 49:08.120
March of the Penguins while lying in bed.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.760
And then after 50 minutes, they had to go to sleep.

49:10.760 --> 49:16.300
And what they found out, the group that played Modern Warfare overall only took a few minutes

49:16.300 --> 49:19.940
longer to fall asleep than those that were watching the movie.

49:19.940 --> 49:21.520
That's because it's the March of the Penguins.

49:21.520 --> 49:24.240
They would have fallen asleep during the movie.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.240
Exactly.

49:25.240 --> 49:26.240
It's boring.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.880
Well, I think the reason why it might take longer to fall asleep is not, it has nothing

49:29.880 --> 49:31.680
to do with the violent content.

49:31.680 --> 49:36.080
I think a more accurate thing would have been play Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare versus

49:36.080 --> 49:40.720
like Super Mario Galaxy or something, or well, maybe that's not the best, or LittleBigPlanet,

49:40.720 --> 49:43.440
you know, something more G-rated in video games.

49:43.440 --> 49:47.920
Because, I think the reason why, you know, even though this whole study is supposed to

49:47.920 --> 49:53.760
show, oh, it doesn't keep you up as late, you know, whatever, I think even the few minutes

49:53.760 --> 49:56.960
were probably because Modern Warfare is more interactive.

49:56.960 --> 49:57.960
You're thinking about it more.

49:57.960 --> 49:58.960
It's more mentally stimulating.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.520
Yeah, it stimulates your mind more than watching a movie.

50:01.520 --> 50:03.100
Isn't quite as mentally stimulating.

50:03.100 --> 50:04.100
Especially March of the Penguins.

50:04.100 --> 50:09.320
I mean, my God, why would you torture someone like that?

50:09.320 --> 50:13.400
I mean, like, I love penguins, but March of the Penguins, yeah, I was about to go to sleep.

50:13.400 --> 50:14.400
During March of the Penguins.

50:14.400 --> 50:15.400
I preferred Happy Feet.

50:15.400 --> 50:16.400
Thank you very much.

50:16.400 --> 50:17.400
Justino.

50:17.400 --> 50:23.800
No, it's, I mean, I've been like, I want to go to the other group.

50:23.800 --> 50:24.800
So there you go.

50:24.800 --> 50:28.200
But this kind of begs the question, you know, kind of tying into the whole, and I'm asking

50:28.200 --> 50:33.380
this to the chat room as well, so chatters, please voice your mind on this one.

50:33.380 --> 50:38.280
Has there been a time where video games have ever impacted your sleep?

50:38.280 --> 50:40.240
I've had dreams about games.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.240
Yeah?

50:41.240 --> 50:46.080
The same way you do about movies, you know, and shows and stuff.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.080
Maybe like-

50:47.080 --> 50:50.800
I've had an interesting Silent Hill dream that I actually wanted to pitch as a game.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.800
Oh, really?

50:51.800 --> 50:53.840
Yeah, but it would be spoiling the ending.

50:53.840 --> 50:58.280
Okay, well, let me not ask so much about the actual dream itself, but let me see your sleep

50:58.280 --> 50:59.360
habits.

50:59.360 --> 51:02.380
Has video games ever impacted, like, when you go to bed or how late you're staying up

51:02.380 --> 51:03.380
at night?

51:03.380 --> 51:04.380
Not really.

51:04.380 --> 51:08.620
I mean, I have a couple of times gotten caught up in a game, like just playing some Star

51:08.620 --> 51:12.880
Trek online, and then I'll realize that I've fallen asleep in a battle or something, and

51:12.880 --> 51:14.880
then I'll just turn it off.

51:14.880 --> 51:15.880
Nice.

51:15.880 --> 51:18.720
I've done that once, by the way.

51:18.720 --> 51:23.400
But I, not really, I mean, I stayed up all night playing Blue Dragon, but my plan first

51:23.400 --> 51:27.600
was to stay up all night, and I played Blue Dragon to keep myself staying up all night.

51:27.600 --> 51:28.600
Right.

51:28.600 --> 51:29.600
So-

51:29.600 --> 51:32.160
I remember when I was younger, I literally stayed up till like 6am in the morning playing

51:32.160 --> 51:33.720
Super Mario Brothers 2 when I first played it.

51:33.720 --> 51:38.440
Well, I did that, though, with Final Fantasy III over here, Final Fantasy VI.

51:38.440 --> 51:39.440
So I did that.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.360
I did it for a week.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.240
And then World of Warcraft.

51:43.240 --> 51:44.240
You know, there's been-

51:44.240 --> 51:45.240
Addict!

51:45.240 --> 51:48.160
That raid that keeps you up later than you intended.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.680
I mean, I'll admit it, it's happened.

51:50.680 --> 51:52.040
Video games have impacted my sleep.

51:52.040 --> 51:53.040
How about you, Loki?

51:53.040 --> 51:54.040
Is the video game-

51:54.040 --> 51:55.040
Final Fantasy XI.

51:55.040 --> 51:59.000
Used to play with the Japanese folks, and in order to play with the Japanese guys, you

51:59.000 --> 52:01.160
have to stay up till 5 in the morning.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.160
I've done that before.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.160
But-

52:03.160 --> 52:04.160
And, uh-

52:04.160 --> 52:05.160
I did it on purpose.

52:05.160 --> 52:06.160
No, um, no.

52:06.160 --> 52:07.160
But, see, that's the thing, though.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.600
That night, that was a conscious choice.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.800
It wasn't like, oh, games making me stay up, you know?

52:11.800 --> 52:16.880
And I have to say, though, after I'm done gaming, fell asleep like a rock.

52:16.880 --> 52:20.400
I mean, it did not keep me up at all.

52:20.400 --> 52:24.560
I actually find that playing a good involving game before I go to bed, for me, works like

52:24.560 --> 52:26.840
reading, you know?

52:26.840 --> 52:31.200
Where it'll kind of help me settle down, because I need to be doing something before I go to

52:31.200 --> 52:32.880
bed so that I'm not-

52:32.880 --> 52:37.240
Because if I'm just sitting here going, buh, bored, buh, bored, buh, bored, then I won't

52:37.240 --> 52:38.880
go to sleep.

52:38.880 --> 52:43.480
But if I've worn my brain out, then I have no problem going to sleep.

52:43.480 --> 52:46.440
Really when you get down to the bottom of the study, what is it that they're trying

52:46.440 --> 52:47.440
to figure out?

52:47.440 --> 52:50.180
They're trying to figure out whether they can blame games for something else.

52:50.180 --> 52:52.120
I mean, that's really what it comes down to.

52:52.120 --> 52:56.320
It's like, oh my god, violent video games are bad because they prevent you from sleeping.

52:56.320 --> 52:57.320
I mean, really-

52:57.320 --> 53:01.120
Because you just lie there in bed thinking about all the blood you just splattered.

53:01.120 --> 53:05.120
You're not gonna, like, play the violent video game and go to bed and go, oh my god, someone's

53:05.120 --> 53:09.720
gonna kill me now, unless you're, like, mentally disturbed, and in which case you shouldn't

53:09.720 --> 53:14.680
be playing games in the first place, at least that way, and I mean, if games are affecting

53:14.680 --> 53:18.000
you in that way, don't play them right before bed.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.400
I mean, come on, take some damn responsibility for yourself.

53:21.400 --> 53:24.360
We don't need to be funding the- I mean, who did this?

53:24.360 --> 53:29.480
Obviously, it's somebody funded by somebody else, so that's money wasted right there,

53:29.480 --> 53:30.640
if you ask me.

53:30.640 --> 53:33.880
Let's go to our chat room with some comments and answers to the question.

53:33.880 --> 53:37.800
Do you- have you ever, like, stayed up all night and had your sleep plans impacted by

53:37.800 --> 53:38.800
a video game?

53:38.800 --> 53:43.600
Shaoran says, if by impacted your sleep you mean play Final Fantasy X all night, in that

53:43.600 --> 53:44.600
case, yeah.

53:44.600 --> 53:48.560
Dartitsuya says, does staying up till all hours of the night playing Beat Media 2DX

53:48.560 --> 53:49.560
count?

53:49.560 --> 53:51.920
Bochikawa says, it has, but I've got sleep issues.

53:51.920 --> 53:56.000
I sleep for too long and use entertainment to try to regulate hours.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.560
Rama says, Sky, that was me with Super Mario Brothers 3 and now I'm doing it with Final

53:59.560 --> 54:00.880
Fantasy XIII.

54:00.880 --> 54:04.720
You know what I kind of find is that I just have a hard problem falling asleep before

54:04.720 --> 54:06.460
midnight, period.

54:06.460 --> 54:10.800
And I don't know if games are to really blame for that, but I just, like, I don't go to

54:10.800 --> 54:14.560
bed before midnight ever, even if I have to be up at five in the morning, or no matter

54:14.560 --> 54:17.280
what time I have to be up, I can't, like, force myself to go to bed before midnight.

54:17.280 --> 54:21.040
Just force feed yourself shows that you don't want to watch, like, for example, reruns on

54:21.040 --> 54:22.040
the Food Network.

54:22.040 --> 54:24.400
It'll put you to sleep without you even knowing it.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.400
But like, I don't know, I can't, like, let myself do that.

54:26.400 --> 54:27.400
I don't know why.

54:27.400 --> 54:28.400
I can't let myself do that either.

54:28.400 --> 54:29.680
It's not all PM if I really want to.

54:29.680 --> 54:34.320
But then my wife is leaning on one side, my cat's on my lap, so, you know, it's like I'm

54:34.320 --> 54:40.280
stuck there with my eyes glued open trying to watch the same episode of Divers, or, you

54:40.280 --> 54:44.480
know, Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and it's like, I've already seen this eight times!

54:44.480 --> 54:46.480
I don't want to see it again.

54:46.480 --> 54:47.480
Ah, alright.

54:47.480 --> 54:51.600
No, but seriously though, everybody is basically saying that they made conscious choices to

54:51.600 --> 54:55.240
stay up because the game they want to play, you know, was fun.

54:55.240 --> 54:58.760
Not necessarily that they stopped playing and they couldn't fall asleep because they

54:58.760 --> 55:01.520
were playing a violent video game, or a video game in general.

55:01.520 --> 55:06.360
So once again, do we really need this study?

55:06.360 --> 55:11.320
On the same token, I have stayed up late reading a book because I wanted to finish the book.

55:11.320 --> 55:13.520
I wanted to get to the next chapter.

55:13.520 --> 55:18.280
I've stayed up watching entire TV series because I wanted to see the next episode.

55:18.280 --> 55:21.000
I wanted to see what happened next.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.360
So it's the same thing.

55:22.360 --> 55:25.640
I was up very late last night watching Mean Girls.

55:25.640 --> 55:31.400
So I'm not lying, I really was up till like 1.30 because we were watching Mean Girls.

55:31.400 --> 55:37.400
I've read books and then fell asleep and started dreaming parts of the book, like, later on,

55:37.400 --> 55:41.940
and then had to turn in a book report and it didn't come out that well because what

55:41.940 --> 55:45.440
I dreamt didn't actually happen in the book.

55:45.440 --> 55:48.360
But it was funny because I didn't know that because I thought I had just been reading

55:48.360 --> 55:50.160
the book.

55:50.160 --> 55:56.000
Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news and then maybe we'll get some emails

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
on this topic.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
I don't know.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.880
I work with weirdos.

56:00.880 --> 56:03.560
Some more news stories for you guys and then we'll get to the Classic Game of the Week

56:03.560 --> 56:04.560
in a little bit.

56:04.560 --> 56:07.840
Well, this is actually something that I ran across completely by accident the other day

56:07.840 --> 56:11.280
and I'm pretty glad that I did.

56:11.280 --> 56:16.120
There is an Iraqi video game coming out.

56:16.120 --> 56:19.760
Developed in Iraq, took 17 years to develop.

56:19.760 --> 56:28.120
It started developing it under Hussein's reign because it was really hard to get in the items

56:28.120 --> 56:30.320
that they needed.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.880
Good God, 17 years?

56:31.880 --> 56:33.880
Is it on the ColecoVision?

56:33.880 --> 56:34.880
1993.

56:34.880 --> 56:41.760
Rabah Shehab was an engineering student at the University of Baghdad and after the Gulf

56:41.760 --> 56:44.880
War he wanted to make a video game.

56:44.880 --> 56:53.680
So he started, it was, there had been none made in Iraq so he basically decided to try

56:53.680 --> 57:03.560
to make a fun game and he wanted to, he wanted to counter the bad images of the Gulf War,

57:03.560 --> 57:06.580
you know, the bombs and everything by showing something that's a little bit more culturally

57:06.580 --> 57:08.120
deep.

57:08.120 --> 57:18.040
And so according to this he saved up to buy an Amiga in Iraq at the time and had to pirate

57:18.040 --> 57:23.240
games so that he could actually play them and see how they were made and he actually

57:23.240 --> 57:30.600
had to recycle floppies because he couldn't get disk drives or anything.

57:30.600 --> 57:33.040
Doesn't he know how to copy that floppy?

57:33.040 --> 57:39.760
Well, at any rate, they finished the game and it's about two brothers named Nasir and

57:39.760 --> 57:45.960
Blasir who went throughout ancient Mesopotamia to fight an evil sorcerer.

57:45.960 --> 57:54.200
And so now the game Babylonian Twins is being published for iPhone and iPod touch, or sorry,

57:54.200 --> 57:57.680
for iPad and iPhone and I guess iPod touch.

57:57.680 --> 58:03.960
But actually I watched some of the movie of it, the little film of it and it's actually

58:03.960 --> 58:04.960
pretty cool.

58:04.960 --> 58:12.120
So they basically redid the graphics all high def and added new music, new levels and it's

58:12.120 --> 58:15.960
actually already on the iPhone so you can go get it.

58:15.960 --> 58:18.520
And it reached the top 20 in the first week.

58:18.520 --> 58:19.520
That's kind of neat.

58:19.520 --> 58:23.800
You know, I really like his inspiration because I think the guy's got a really good point.

58:23.800 --> 58:28.600
I think there's a lot of people over here, because a lot of us have practically grown

58:28.600 --> 58:29.600
up on the Gulf War.

58:29.600 --> 58:33.960
I mean, I know that's a weird way of saying it, but especially the demographic that listens

58:33.960 --> 58:38.240
to this program in their 20s and stuff have known of the Gulf War since they were kids.

58:38.240 --> 58:44.600
So I think the images we get of Iraq, unfortunately, are bombs, Saddam Hussein when they pulled

58:44.600 --> 58:47.840
him out of the ground and he looked all like crazy.

58:47.840 --> 58:49.760
These are the images people have of Iraq.

58:49.760 --> 58:59.800
But there's this whole culture and years of history, a country, land that's been around

58:59.800 --> 59:04.200
for years and years before any of this was going on and the oil wars and all this stuff

59:04.200 --> 59:06.800
of culture that people don't really know about.

59:06.800 --> 59:13.720
Well, I want to quote actually the last line of this article because I think that it goes

59:13.720 --> 59:15.840
along with what you're saying.

59:15.840 --> 59:21.720
This game is just a small creation from what he sees as a vibrant but downtrodden people

59:21.720 --> 59:26.160
and he hopes that in America it can serve as a small indication of what Iraq is beyond

59:26.160 --> 59:27.160
a deadly quagmire.

59:27.160 --> 59:30.560
By the way, and by the way, of all places, I got this at AOL news.

59:30.560 --> 59:32.560
Hey, nothing wrong with that.

59:32.560 --> 59:33.560
Yeah.

59:33.560 --> 59:37.240
So I'm going to link this in the chat room and I'd love for people to watch the little

59:37.240 --> 59:38.840
trailer that came with it.

59:38.840 --> 59:40.600
It looks super fun, actually.

59:40.600 --> 59:41.600
I'm going to download it.

59:41.600 --> 59:42.600
It looks kind of Mario-esque.

59:42.600 --> 59:47.320
I'm actually going to download it on iTunes right now and I'll hopefully do a review next

59:47.320 --> 59:48.320
week.

59:48.320 --> 59:49.320
Very cool.

59:49.320 --> 59:54.920
Well, props, props to that guy for, I mean, 17 years is an awfully long time and that's,

59:54.920 --> 59:59.240
that's a lot of drive to, um, and something you really believe in.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.520
I mean, if you think about it, we've only been doing this show, which has definitely

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.460
been a labor of love, uh, for what, eight years?

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:08.960
That's not even half the time it took this guy to make this game.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.760
Just food for thought.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.640
It's, to be fair, he didn't spend all that time making the game.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.640
Okay.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.460
But still, I mean, he never just let it die, right?

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.460
You know what?

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:26.720
It's, it's three bucks on iPhone and five bucks on the iPad, the HD version on iPad.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.720
So you know what?

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.920
You can spend three bucks and give it a try.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920
All right.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920
We'll go look at the trailer.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.920
See what's up your alley.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.400
One other thing is that because he had to put, he actually put a lot of expense into

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.840
it because all this stuff was really expensive to get, you know, especially in the times

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840
that he was in.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.040
So he was actually quoted saying that he doesn't expect to really make back the money he spent

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.160
on it, but it would be nice.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.120
So I, you know, help a guy out, spend the three bucks, you know, let them know that

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.440
his, you know, wasn't in vain.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.880
All right.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.200
Well best of luck to the guy in, um, um, selling the application and getting the word out there

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.220
that Iraq is, is much more than, than, than, than a war.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:09.080
I think that's a very good, um, kind of moral, I guess, to the story.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.080
All right.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.920
Let's talk about some other games coming out, uh, around the world and some other, uh, parts.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.520
We'll start here in the U.S. with Loki.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.720
What's coming out in the U.S. this week?

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.480
Uh, not a lot, but there's some decent stuff.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.480
Um, start off with Blood Bowl on PSP.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.280
It's delayed from a few weeks ago, finally, hopefully coming out on, uh, PSP this week.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.800
Uh, the Classic Controller Pro in both white and black coming out to tie in with, uh, Monster

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.640
Hunter Tri, which will be making its way out on the Wii.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.200
Um, also All-Star Karate coming to, uh, the Wii as well.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.640
I guess that's a little bit better than All-Star Cheerleader.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:52.840
And then finally, um, Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper coming out on, uh, Xbox 360.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:59.520
Also on the PlayStation Network and Xbox, um, 360 Marketplace this week, After Burner

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:05.360
Climax will be the game of the week.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.960
I bet, uh, Dark Sakura's gonna, uh, check that out.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960
Yep.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960
I heard, yeah.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.960
Damn straight.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.960
All right.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.800
Let's go over to Japan and look at the, uh, Japanese release dates.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.800
Uh, a little bit busier this week than it has been in recent weeks in Japan.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:25.240
Uh, coming out on the Xbox 360, Ketsuie Kizuna Jigoku Tachi Extra, uh, in regular and limited

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.480
editions on the 360.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:31.200
This is a shooter classic from Cave that's getting upgraded for the 360, uh, includes

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.160
networking abilities, uh, where you can play with other people, uh, in a shooter.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160
So...

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160
Cave did Eskebaloo...

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160
Eskebaloo.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.160
That's right.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.860
So, uh, you shooter fans, you SHMUP fans have something to look forward to this week, um,

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.760
and I imagine some folks will be importing that.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.760
Uh, also on the 360 this week, from Square Enix, Nier Gestalt.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.160
And that, this is, uh, one of the ones they've been teasing for a little while, right, Nier?

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:57.840
Uh, is this one of the ones that's on the, um, uh, Unreal Engine, as well?

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.680
Um, maybe, I don't remember.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.880
But it is a big new action-adventure RPG series that is coming out over here, what, by the

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.880
end of the year?

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.440
Uh, actually, it's coming out the week after next.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.760
Oh, wow, so, good, we'll have to wait very long to get it over here.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:16.080
But if you want to get it a couple weeks early, the Japanese release is out soon.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.320
Also, uh, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion is getting its Game of the Year edition finally

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.320
out in Japan.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.600
It took them a little while to get Oblivion over there, because they have a translated

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.800
version, right?

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.960
And there's a lot of dialogue and so forth in Oblivion.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.520
I mean, god, talk about a game with depth.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.420
So they're just now getting around to their Game of the Year edition, like we've had over

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.880
here in the US for a while.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.640
Uh, same style, same style on the PlayStation 3.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.840
Uh, PlayStation 3 is also getting its own version of Nier, but they call it Nier Replicant

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840
on the PS3.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.240
It's almost like, uh, a different game on the 360 and the PS3.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.440
I'm not sure how that all works.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.420
Is that like a Pokemon red and blue thing, but it's on different systems?

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.420
I have no idea.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.420
That's very interesting.

01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:56.960
It could be a side story.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.960
It could be.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.960
Sometimes that happens.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.960
That's very interesting.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.920
You don't really usually see that in the same week though.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.880
That's, I'm curious to see how that plays out.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.080
Uh, the Nintendo Wii does not have any huge games this week, but they have one called

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.180
Ivy the Kiwi.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.180
That sounds cute.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.180
Ivy the Kiwi.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:17.040
This looks a lot like, um, oh, some game I've seen on the, uh, no, I guess it's not that

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.040
same game.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.040
Oh, it looks cute though.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.800
I like the art style in this game.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800
Looks very cool.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.920
Uh, imagine like a very hand drawn kind of game, uh, that's coming out on the Wii this

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.920
week.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.920
I like that art style.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.200
Google that and look at some pictures from that.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.600
That's Ivy the Kiwi as a question.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.600
Ivy the Kiwi?

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.440
Uh, PlayStation 2 gets another pachinko game out this week.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.720
This one, uh, Higurashi no Naku Korom ni Matsuri, but just what you really needed.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720
Another pachinko game.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720
How about the Nintendo DS?

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:47.680
Nintendo DS gets its own version of Ivy the Kiwi, uh, but the big release would be Naruto,

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:53.800
Naruto Shippuden Ninjutsu Senkai-Cha Crash comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.960
Yes, it's another Naruto game.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.960
It's a brand new battle system though.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:06.720
You fill your chakra gauge as you fight Sasuke, Itachi, or Dodara, whatever, uh, if you're

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.960
a fan of Naruto, I'm sure you already have that on import and, uh, on the PSP, actually

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:15.680
some big, big releases on the PSP this week, Knights in the Nightmare comes out and I think

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.960
a game that a lot of folks are going to be into on the PSP, Disgaea Infinite comes out.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960
That's right.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.600
Disgaea on the PSP with infinite possibilities.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.440
Let's go over to the UK.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.440
Dark soccer.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.440
I was covered in glue.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.440
Sorry.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.440
Still sniffing the glue over there, huh?

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.520
No, I'm working on the back end of my thing now, so I'm almost done with my decoupage.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520
I love that word.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:48.360
Anyway, um, on the 20th we have, um, the misadventures of PB Winterbottom, and that actually makes

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:54.040
me sad because of one of my co-workers, except for the middle initial, those are his last

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.680
name and first initial, so it actually made me think about him.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.680
Interesting.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:04.440
I hope it doesn't have anything to do with him, um, um, and Vigilant Chronicles, an MMO.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:12.000
21st Afterburner Climax, woohoo, and, um, the 23rd Dead to Rights Retribution, Monster

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.120
Hunter Tri, Nier, and the Whispered World.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.720
That's a cool name, the Whispered World.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.720
That's it.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.480
That is a nice name.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.480
Whispered World.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.480
The Whispered World.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.480
Whisperer.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.480
Makes me think of Wispy Woods.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.480
How was the stage?

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.320
Anybody know where Wispy Woods comes from?

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.320
Kirby's Avalon.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.320
Good job!

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320
You get a gold star.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.320
You have that game.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.560
When you go to the level it goes, Wispy Woods.

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:41.480
You are a classic game sponge, I love it.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.320
Kirby's Avalanche was like my game until I discovered it was Puyo Puyo.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.600
I was like, Puyo Puyo.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.680
Kirby's Avalanche was my game and I never discovered it was Puyo Puyo until, seriously,

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.920
this show, and interacting with you and your sponge of import game knowledge.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.840
You know what else was Puyo Puyo, right?

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.840
The Dr. Robotnik.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.040
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.040
Oh yeah.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.900
And I think a lot of people always wondered back in the day, like, how come the same damn

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:08.440
game is out on the Genesis and the Nintendo, but they use the different franchises?

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.600
Like, that was kind of weird to see back then.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.600
Anyhow.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.040
It was just to get those games to sell in the US, just put a big game on them.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.040
Did it work?

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040
I think so.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.040
I mean, the Kirby's Avalanche was great.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040
Yeah, it was.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.720
And actually, the digitized voice in it was really well done.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.720
Wispy Woods.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.280
Anyhow.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280
Talk about random.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.280
Hi, Loki.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.280
What's on deck next?

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:35.160
Well, apparently the US government has asked Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to create a game

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.000
about balancing the budget.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:47.160
Yes, apparently Erskine Bowles, co-chair of President Obama's fiscal commission, is trying

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.160
to...

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.160
Say that ten times faster.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:54.760
Is trying to create a game to educate the public about the difficulty of reducing the

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:57.640
US budget deficit.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:07.800
So basically, they're trying to create a game to show you that balancing the budget is hard!

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:14.800
And the joke, of course, goes that anybody who is able to balance the budget will immediately

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:21.920
be whisked away to some secret government location a la Last Starfighter to balance

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.000
the real budget.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.640
It's budget mama.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.640
Don't worry.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.640
Mama will fix it.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:33.560
But why spend money to say that, oh, my job is hard, I can't do this.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.720
I mean, it just sounds like whining to me.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.880
Budget mama for President 2012.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.000
And the other way you can look at it is like, well, we don't know how to do it.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.560
Do you guys have any ideas?

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.040
I mean, really?

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.900
I thought, and granted, I didn't read the story.

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:51.120
I just thought from looking at the title we're putting together tonight's thing, because

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.120
you know what we're talking about.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.040
I don't like to spoil myself, because I like to kind of have topics unfold on air here.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:00.660
But I kind of thought when they talked about a game about balancing the budget, I kind

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.000
of thought it would be like personal budget.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.560
Like teach kids at a young age how to not spend more than they make and maybe like how

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.600
to save a little bit and so forth.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.020
That would seem like the game to make, right?

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:19.280
Like an Oregon Trail, but with the, you know, you don't spend too much on the wagon wheels

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.880
because then you won't have enough for food unless you take a lot of guns with you because

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.440
you can shoot buffalo and have 999 pounds of food.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:32.640
And in case you didn't think that, you know, the Obama campaign is out of it enough, they

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:37.260
thought that, you know, what you could get is support among the populace for an exceptionally

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:42.560
unpopular thing that you need to solve this problem.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.280
And also saying that the game could go viral.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280
Wow.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.440
Way to use buzzwords that you have no idea what the meaning are.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.120
Like Super Chick Sisters and the other PETA games and how viral they went.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.120
Viral.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120
I'm sorry.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.360
It has to be good for it to go viral.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.760
Well, actually it has to be popular for viral.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.880
No, I mean joystick Kotaku and all those kids will report on it and people will play it

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.140
for like a day and then they'll be like, LOL and then never played again.

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.680
That's what happens with a lot of these, like the PETA games.

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.160
Same thing, right?

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.160
People, people look at them, play them once, go LOL and then that's it.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.520
Honestly, I actually think that you touched on something earlier that might actually be

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.520
legitimate.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.040
Um, Matt did.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.680
There's also an A plus genius comment in chat I want to get to in just a minute.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.680
Okay.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.840
I really do think that perhaps the whole point behind this is to trick people into actually

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.280
playing it to get new ideas.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:39.080
Cause seriously, it's like I put it in the same category and I'm being serious as America's

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.880
army.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.520
You know, picking interest on who would want to be a soldier, who would want to do this,

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.140
you know, getting a realistic point of view.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:51.180
This is giving a realistic point of view to people because who knows, there may be some

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:55.760
genius mathematician out there who might just be able to be a good advisor and do it.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.800
Yeah, but these people are hired for this job.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.400
This isn't like who wants to be a millionaire.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.040
You can't fucking poll the audience for an answer.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.880
I mean, what is going on?

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.060
Is that the previous way of doing things hasn't worked.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.880
There's people who can't do it even though they are trained.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.400
They're trained to think in a particular way.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400
So you get people who think differently.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.720
And maybe I'm taking your comment in the wrong context and running another way in it, but

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.200
could it be then that you're saying maybe this act, I mean, I don't think this is what

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:29.720
you're saying, but kind of of that comment, maybe this is a way to tell kids balancing

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.140
the budget is hard and think about how you spend your own money because balancing the

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.360
government budget is next to impossible.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.600
No that's not what it is.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.600
No.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.560
Well I know that's not what it is, but I think it makes sense in that light.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:46.840
But seriously, I think what it is, is a way to tap an untrained mind.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.080
You know what I mean?

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:52.160
You could find something, you know, because I know people who are freaking math prodigies

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:57.720
who don't really, aren't into the politics behind it, who would say, you know, yeah,

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.600
I'm not attached to the government office.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:05.000
Here's what I would do without having to have all of those stressors of, oh, lobbyists this,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.240
lobbyists that, we want this, we want that, we want this, we want that.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:19.000
I mean, keep in mind the benefit of getting an, I would have to say an unfiltered perspective.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.880
Getting fresh eyes to look at something, I mean, that is legitimately a unique way of

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.880
doing it.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.560
I mean, it's one thing to just go out and pull a bunch of people who you know to be

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:33.440
talented in it, but another thing to put it out under the pretenses of a game and let

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.960
people work on it without having a real attachment to it and see what creative solution they

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.440
come up with.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.920
A better sim would be for them.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.320
It's so crazy, Jamie, it might be true.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.480
Like that's my thought.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.080
And again, keep, keep in mind, keep in mind, I, I'm coming from the point of view where

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.320
a, okay, keep, and the design point of view, let's put it this way.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.320
You've got all these people who are trained to do, oh, we use Helvetica for this, we do

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.280
Swiss design, we do this, we do that.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:07.300
The FedEx logo was created by an intern, you know, just some new kid who came in.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.300
So think about that.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:14.160
You know, you get that fresh perspective, you get someone who's not bogged down by just

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:20.640
the weight of the industry, you know, in this case by the weight of politics.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.640
Where could they go?

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.640
Ironically enough, I don't like talking about my day job a lot on this show, but I know,

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.500
you know, I did mention I just started a new day job this past week actually.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.980
And I think part of what they're looking for me to me to bring to this position is a fresh

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:33.980
perspective.

01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:37.240
That's a, that's a big part of like, you know, why I'm doing the job I'm doing.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.080
So it's interesting that you kind of tie that together.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.000
Well, if they want a fresh perspective, vote these people out of office.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.440
These people were not voted into their job.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.440
They were elected.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.240
Well, we can take care, we can take care of the people that put them there.

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.920
I really think you're completely missing the point.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.640
But I worry that the people that would jump up and say, I'll do the job instead are not

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.440
the ones that should be doing it either.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440
You know what I mean?

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.400
I'm looking at this as a consultant, someone who will provide the fresh perspective, someone

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:11.880
who will give the ideas and then let the people who are trained, who see the big picture actually

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.880
run with it.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.880
I think it's brilliant, honestly.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.680
I really do think it's very intelligent.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:21.640
And I'm, you know, especially if our president is backing, supports the idea, then I'm very

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.640
glad I voted for him.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.120
Well, just so you guys know, it isn't the first time that they've tried this.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:31.560
Apparently in 1989, the National Economic Commission distributed hard choices on floppies

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.400
for $20 a copy.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:43.840
And apparently also the 1994 Commission also released a game with the title Budget Shadows.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.480
And budget shadows.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:51.920
And unfortunately, even though those games were released, we still don't have a balanced

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.920
budget.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.920
OK.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.160
How many of you got total random tangent?

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.160
But quick poll in studio.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.040
How many of you guys watch Channel 6 KVIE?

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.320
How many guys watch Channel 6?

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320
I have.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320
What if it's not Channel 6?

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.360
I know this is a Sacramento reference, but whatever.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:05.360
It's KVIE.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.360
KVIE.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.360
The PBS.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.960
How many guys ever watch that?

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:09.960
I have.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960
I have two.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.560
They show some neat things once in a while on PBS, actually, besides just Sesame Street

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.560
and Mr. Rogers.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.560
We were bored one night.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560
Extremely bored.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.560
And high.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.560
And there was nothing.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560
No, not high.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560
We were so bored.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.400
And the only thing it was on was a Michael Bolton concert.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:28.800
And it was like, I don't want to watch this, but seriously, it is the only thing on TV

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.800
right now.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.400
Hey, well, actually we had a story a couple weeks ago about how Video Games Live was doing

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.040
a thing for PBS.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.280
That would have been way better than the Michael Bolton concert.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:39.440
I saw a Lorena McKinnon concert that was filmed for PBS that was amazing.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.440
It was amazing.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.520
Although I have to say props to them for being one of the first to have HD.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.520
So you know.

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.560
PBS introduced me to Doctor Who when I was a child.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:53.200
Well, the reason why I bring that up, and I'm not just saying this comment is great

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.480
because it's from a friend of mine, but Sagonar Chatroom says, this is why I need to start

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.000
the Corporation for Public Gaming.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.800
I always found that there was a need for journalistic game development in the vein of the persuasive

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.800
games.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.040
So while I like the idea of having a budget balance game, but this isn't quite the most

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.320
productive path to make an effective title.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:17.520
And there's a part of me that goes, why isn't there a foundation for public gaming, a corporation

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.660
like there is for PBS?

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:22.560
This Jazz Jackrabbit was brought to you by...

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.560
Well.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.560
Yeah.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.560
Why not?

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.560
I agree.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.560
Isn't it weird?

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:31.160
But I think there's Flash games that are like that, aren't there?

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.000
It's different.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.760
And maybe television is different than like Xbox and Wii and all this, but certainly like

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.640
maybe PC games.

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:46.240
It is a little interesting that we don't have more of a, I guess publicly funded game development

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.240
thing.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.240
Although I guess maybe that's part of what Loki's talking about.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.240
I don't know.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.240
It's very interesting.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.040
I just thought, I just kind of read that comment and I went, huh, that's a really good point.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.720
How come they have it for TV if they don't have it for games?

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.720
Hmm.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:16:59.720
Interesting.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:03.560
Anyhow, we've got a couple more stories here and then we're going to get to the classic

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.560
game of the week.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.760
Uh, I want to talk about Xbox live and crime.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.160
Do, do, do, do, do.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.800
Uh, here's the deal.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.240
What happened is that there was a Connecticut man, just 23 years old, he was out on bail.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.400
I guess he had been arrested for gun charges, drug charges, you know, all that type of shady

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400
stuff.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.480
Apparently he got re-arrested even though he was out on bail.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.480
Why?

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.040
He sent threatening messages to witnesses on Xbox live.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.880
This all according to the New Haven Connecticut register, uh, Anthony Hayward is his name

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:39.320
and he sent an Xbox live message to one of the witnesses that says, rats die slow.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.160
And it included the witnesses home address.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.360
This was back in December, but you know, things take time.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.600
Can we give him a stupid award?

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.600
Uh, we could.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.880
You know, what's funny though is that could just be regular Xbox live dialogue if you

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:50.880
ask me.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.280
I mean, he might not have actually been there.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.560
I was just playing call of duty officer.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.560
Seriously.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:01.800
This is dark soccer is talking about the stupid award, uh, by the way, uh, just so you know,

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.280
he had been arrested last summer.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.000
Uh, there was a stolen gun under the passenger seat of the car he was driving.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.520
Uh, apparently the witness said he placed it there.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.800
He surrendered himself to police.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.240
He was charged with witness tampering, intimidating the witness and two counts of second degree

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.240
harassment.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:22.120
The judge set the bail for $50,000.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:34.160
Idiot, I gotta say though, Xbox live, you know, you don't, it's just another medium

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.360
now it's just as easy as writing an email or whatever.

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.360
All right.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.240
Dark soccer has got one more story for us and then the classic game of the week.

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.240
Dark soccer.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.240
Oh yeah.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.820
So, um, you remember me telling you a long time ago about playing descent and having

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:49.680
to have it on 14 discs back in the day?

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.680
Yes.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.760
She had to install three and a half inch floppies, she had to install like 14 disc.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.760
Please insert this too.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.760
Please insert this three.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.760
Yes.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.120
And my friend who actually I've reconnected with on Facebook recently, my friend Avery,

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.800
um, he built a, he, he modified a chair for descent.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.520
I thought it was pretty cool.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.840
It was Uber.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.840
Awesome.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.520
Like did the chair move as descent?

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:13.480
No, but he had like joysticks rigged and key pads and stuff.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480
Okay.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.000
I wonder if he still has it.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Anyway.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:22.440
So Interplay is actually going to be bringing descent to WiiWare and, um, it's being developed

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:31.000
by G1M2 and, um, we'll be using the Wiimote, um, to, uh, move in the game.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
That's going to be interesting.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.880
I, I got to tell you, if you have a hard time conceptualizing 3d in your mind, like I know

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.280
a lot of us did when we had to move from 2d to 3d gaming, like part of the reason I struggle

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.240
with Metroid is I can't imagine like just conceptualizing it all in 3d is kind of hard

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:49.760
sometimes like descent will seriously like mess with your mind so hard because it is

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:55.440
full 360 degree movement, but basically, um, well, you know how hard it was to control

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.440
the keyboard.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.440
I mean, it was a pain in the ass.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.440
Right.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.780
And it wasn't that it was a little bit easier with joysticks, but, but all of your movement

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:05.660
then is just going to be intuitive moving through.

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.660
You don't have a button.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.400
It's just moving the sticks.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.400
So interesting.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:15.280
And here's what I would propose the reversal head tracking mode.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:20.600
Could you imagine playing this as a head tracking game, crazy hearing around corners, moving

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.800
forward, backing up.

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.800
That would be crazy.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.800
Go nuts.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:26.800
Too bad.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.800
It's not going to happen.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.800
Nope.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.800
You know, actually it kind of related to that.

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.400
Did you happen to see the link that I put up on my Facebook about the, um, the interactive

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.400
windows?

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.720
I don't think so.

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:42.240
These, these people, and I'll try to find the article again, but these people, um, made

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.880
a wall facade and put up windows in it with actually two, um, plasma monitors and, uh,

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.680
uh, uh, Mac.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:55.720
And um, they did the we moat hack to, and then had like this, a sensor board that you

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:59.440
could wear around your neck and it would head track the window so you could go to the windows

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.760
and peer through them and go around and, um, oh, sorry, the poltergeist are attacking my

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.760
room again.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.760
Um, but you could peer in the windows and everything.

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:12.720
I really, really think that that should be where those kinds of games go.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:13.720
Hmm.

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.640
Well, will you get, will you check this out?

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.960
I'd throw up, but I think it'd be funny.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.880
Will you check this out on WiiWare when it comes out?

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.880
Probably.

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.880
Yeah.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:22.880
Although I really, and I didn't-

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.880
Did they name a price?

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:24.880
Or a little early for that?

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.880
Let's see.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.880
Mm-hmm.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.880
Might be a little early for that.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880
Yeah, I think it's too early for that.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.040
But, um, I, I, what I would really like to see though with that is I soup, I hope it's

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:38.560
not pixel like it was, I would really like for them to at least just clean up the pixels

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.560
in it.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.560
They might.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.560
Or render it.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.560
Shit.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.560
I mean.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.480
Um, before we get into the next segment here, I just want to quickly ask DarkSakura a question

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.040
from a chatter here.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.200
Fun ET man in chat says, good night, but a quick question for DarkSakura.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:59.360
Which Puyo Puyo is the best for being the most easily obtainable?

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.880
An actual Puyo Puyo?

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.880
I'm sure-

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.880
DS.

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.880
Puyo Puyo DS, probably.

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:05.880
Well, for the US, yeah.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:09.280
I would say you can get, um, Puyo Pop.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280
Whatever that one was.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.580
Wasn't there a Puyo Party or something?

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:15.600
There was just a game called Puyo Puyo DS that came out when the DS first came out.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.600
Yeah, you can-

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.600
It's probably really easy to get and cheap now.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.600
Probably.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.120
Um, I, I, but Puyo Pop, you can just get that anywhere.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:27.760
Um, and it came out on, um, DS and I've actually got a Puyo Puyo that came out on Neo Geo Pocket

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.280
Color a while back.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.760
If you're looking for an import, though, I don't know.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:41.080
I got, I have, uh, um, the PC Engine Duo version, which my friend picked up for, you know, 900

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.080
yen in Japan.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:45.940
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but just go get a Super Nintendo emulator and download

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.940
Kirby's Avalanche.

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:49.940
Kirby's Avalanche!

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:50.940
I didn't tell you that.

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:51.940
It's also supported in MAME, too, by the way.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:52.940
Oh, is it?

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:53.940
Yeah.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:54.940
It's good to know.

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:59.200
But, there's, like, all kinds of versions, like, Nintendo 64 had a version, Saturn had,

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:04.280
um, I think Puyo Puyo Sun, which is actually one I'm still looking for.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.760
That's a game I'm actually looking for, is Puyo Puyo Sun.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:10.520
Actually, and to be fair, maybe I shouldn't endorse the whole emulator thing, there, I

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.160
believe Robotnik's Mean Beaten Machine is all over those Sega collections.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.080
It's tucked away on a lot of the Sonic ones.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:23.320
But, uh, I'm, in fact, I'm positive it's on the Mega, uh, Sonic's Genesis Collection game

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:27.220
that came out a couple, like, last year, uh, and that's a great deal, because that game

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:32.520
was only, like, what, 20 bucks, and it's, like, 30, 40 Genesis games, it's, it's, and

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.880
some arcade games, uh, and Mean Beaten Machine is one of them.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880
So cheap now.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:39.240
Oh, it's, uh, that is, seriously, that's an awesome buy.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.240
It really is.

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.240
It's super fun.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:45.840
Especially for you younger guys, who, and gals, who didn't kind of grow up experiencing

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.960
Genesis like, like we did.

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.520
And there's also some actually pretty fun achievements in it, but you unlock your games,

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.000
too, by getting certain scores on some of the crappier games.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Yeah.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Good times.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Yeah.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Okay.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.600
Um, see, see, see how much this woman knows about her classic gaming?

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.640
That's why she gets a segment every week on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.640
Oh, by the way.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.640
Huh?

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.880
Puyo Puyo 64 was a four player, was a four player Puyo Puyo C. Can you tell me who that

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.880
was?

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:11.880
See what I mean?

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:12.880
She just, she knows her shit.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.440
So, uh, every week on this show, Dark Sakura dives into the vault and, uh, picks out a

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.400
classic game that she thinks you all should be playing this week, right now.

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.240
She was to edumacate you on a classic game.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.160
It's called Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.040
Dark Sakura, what could the Classic Game of the Week possibly be?

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.240
It's Descent.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.120
What a crazy coincidence.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.440
What made you, what made you decide to pick it this week?

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.120
Uh, because I felt like it.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.120
It was either that or Microcosm.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.120
Maybe next week.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.120
Maybe.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.400
Alright, well this is, it's certainly worthy of being the Game of the Week and even, you

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.920
know, it just, it ties into the news, certainly, but I think there's a lot of people that miss

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.920
this game.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.920
Yep.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.920
So tell us about Descent, Dark Sakura.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.680
So you go throughout the solar system from the moon to, uh, Pluto's moon, Charon, and

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.320
then you beat a boss robot, but then you can't go home.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.880
Um, but yeah, all these infected robots, you have to shoot them and then stop the main

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.360
robot, blah, blah, blah.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.760
Um, this is actually one of the games that made me really motion sick.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:17.680
For, it was, um, it used, um, a wireframe map, but, um, it was only, like, around your

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:24.360
absolute position, so you, you know, as you'd move through it, it was, it, it's really hard

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:25.360
to describe.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:30.160
And also, the thing that actually made me really motion sick about this one is that

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.720
you seem to always be tilting.

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.380
I mean, I'm not the only one who saw that, right?

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:38.560
So anyway, um.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.520
I would play it spinning all the time.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.960
I was in a constant barrel roll.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.800
I could, I had a hard ass time controlling it.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:57.760
Um, but, um, it was, it was actually, um, one of the, I think, harder games too.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.120
It was real, it was a full 3D environment.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:09.840
You had to increase your speed while using acceleration controls and, uh, directional

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.920
controls and different stuff.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.400
You had to pretty much multitask the entire time you were playing.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.400
So that was pretty difficult.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:24.560
Um, it did have an 8-player LAN mode, um, and then, um, actually, I think there's even

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.280
still Descent servers up today.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:33.320
Um, Descent 2, um, was, uh, actually supposed to be pretty much okay online too.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:40.080
Um, there were 27 levels, um, in, and 3 secret levels in the first Descent.

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:49.120
You had, like, some of them were the moon, um, Venus, Mercury, um, parts of Mars, uh,

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:54.600
moons on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, blah, blah, blah.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.240
Um, so you would just show up in your different location when you started and you would have

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.560
your, um, shield energy, which was like your life.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:09.640
Um, but you could, um, only, um, restore your shield through power-ups and it would only

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.280
go up to 200%.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:17.280
Um, and if you finished the mission below 100%, your shield's charged to 100%, but on

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.440
the, but if you were above 100%, then it would stay where it was.

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:24.440
Like, if you were at 120, it would be at 120 when you start off.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.880
Um, and you did have limited lives, unlimited in multiplayer, um, and when you respawn,

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.880
you start from the beginning, the beginning of the level.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.240
So it was pretty, kind of crazy.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:45.280
Um, it was originally DOS, um, for 386 PCs, uh, 33 megahertz, um, you play it on something,

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.960
you know, now, of course, it's gonna play like a dream, you know, if you can, of course,

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:49.960
find this doctor.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:53.680
Yeah, you're gonna have to use one of those programs to slow, like, it would be too fast,

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.680
yeah, like a DOS emulator.

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:59.120
Um, there is a port- Or wait for WiiWare.

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.120
Yeah.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:05.440
Um, there is a, uh, port for, uh, PlayStation, and there was one planned for Saturn that

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.160
never was released.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:12.520
Um, so yeah, you can get, um, there's a shareware version of 94 that came out after Doom came

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:23.640
out, um, and you'd, like, we were saying you have to use a software renderer, um, but,

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:29.280
um, other than that, it was just, it- Just be prepared for a trip, because you gotta

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.120
fly upside down and all this stuff, you know, it's full 360 degrees, I mean, what's- The

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:38.360
way I kind of think of this game is it's, like, Doom without gravity, you know?

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.360
Yeah.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:43.520
Well, and on top of that, the one thing that you're having to do is that the texture mapping,

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:50.000
um, goes every 32 pixels, so you deal with a lot of pop-up, especially if you're, actually,

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.440
if you don't have things set to emulate it just right, you know what I mean?

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.440
Mm-hmm.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:02.160
And, um, the, uh, engine used for it is a, uh, portal rendering engine, so that, um,

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:09.680
you could connect different sectors, so, uh, that was pretty cool, um, and they've actually,

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:15.640
um, released the, uh, source code without the audio in 97, and actually the source code

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.240
for Descent 2 was released in 99.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.240
Oh, wow.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:24.280
So different expansions out, there's the Descent Mission Builder, uh, 95, uh, there was Descent

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:30.040
Levels of the World 95, Descent Anniversary Edition that had all the other add-ons, and

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:34.040
the extra levels that Parallax made, Descent on PlayStation, and Descent on WiiWare that's

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.640
coming out this fall.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:41.360
Um, as far as anything that's related to, there was Descent Under Mountain, which was

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:46.760
an RPG that used the Descent Graphics engine, um, but wasn't really in it, and then there

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.560
was the clone Forsaken, do you remember that?

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.760
Yes, I do.

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:52.760
Was that the one that had the commercial?

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:53.760
Yeah.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.760
The future's forsaken.

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:56.480
Yes, I remember that game.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:02.640
And then, um, Descent Free Space The Great War was put out, um, by Volition in 98, but

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.520
it wasn't really a Descent game, I just shared the name.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:11.400
Um, Volition was working on Descent 4, but it was cancelled in, um, 2000 because Descent

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:17.280
3 didn't sell that well, so, but it served as the basis for Red Faction.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:18.280
Interesting.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.280
So.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.280
Alright.

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.280
That's it.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:25.480
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.920
I can't believe it, it's not Sega.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.920
That's alright, no.

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:28.920
Hey!

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.920
No, it's a good game, this is a great pick.

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.520
I felt it was appropriate.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.080
It's very, uh, news appropriate.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.080
I love it.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.080
So fair.

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.360
And it's a game I really enjoy, and I actually remember this one.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.320
Oh god, this game made me so motion sick.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.760
You know when I was saying that the Pixel ones never did?

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.760
This one actually?

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.680
Well it was really rudimentary 3D rendered.

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:49.440
It really was, it wasn't so sprite based, it was like, it really was 3D rendered.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.760
It kind of looks like Mode 7 Hell.

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:52.760
Yeah.

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.400
Well except not as blurry.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.400
Yeah.

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.880
But yeah, even watching it on YouTube is like, ugh.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.880
Blur.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.880
Alright.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:01.880
There it is.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.560
But do you not see what I mean by it feels like you're tilting all the time?

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:08.240
No, and the full 360 motion is kind of hell on the brain.

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.240
I get what you're saying.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.240
Oh, yeah.

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.240
Alright.

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:14.000
Well we got plenty more coming up when we come back from a quick break here at Orange

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Laundry Radio.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
We're only halfway done if even that.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.520
We're going to talk about some moving and shaking going on on the PlayStation Network.

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:24.080
We're going to talk about arcades, a major arcade chain going through some big changes.

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:29.240
And Capcom, apparently some big, big news leaking out of Capcom.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.260
Someone's breaking embargo.

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:34.880
We will talk a little bit about that a little later on in the show.

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:35.880
But yeah, stay tuned.

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:45.360
We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:51.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, April the 18th of 2010.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.600
It should be noted that it is the night before dark.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.600
Sakura's birthday.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.600
Birthday, birthday, birthday.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.600
Yep.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.800
So I'm doing whatever I want.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:31:59.800
So happy birthday.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.800
Early birthday.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:01.800
Do you have to work tomorrow?

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.800
No.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:03.800
I don't.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:04.800
I asked for tomorrow off.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:05.800
Nice.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:06.800
That's the best birthday present you could possibly give yourself.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.800
But guess what I have to do?

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:08.800
What?

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.800
Hang out at DMV.

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:10.800
Uh-oh.

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:11.800
Is tomorrow the day your license expires?

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.800
And I didn't schedule an appointment.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:14.800
No.

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.800
No.

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:19.720
The thing that I was working on when you got here has been eating all my time.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.720
Oh, I see.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:21.720
That, and I was sick.

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.720
Sick.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.720
That's a bummer.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.720
Yeah.

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.720
I feel a lot better now.

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:26.720
Well, how do you feel about-

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.720
How about me smelling glue?

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:30.560
How do you feel about turning 21?

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:34.200
And now you'll actually be able to drink legally?

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.200
Just kidding.

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.200
All right.

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.680
You know, whoever guesses my age, if they shut up, then I will give them a prize.

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680
All right.

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:42.680
I actually, you know what?

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.680
You know what?

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.680
I don't care if people know how old I am.

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:45.680
Okay.

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.680
You know how old I am?

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:47.680
How old?

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:51.240
I will be, as of 2 a.m., 34.

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.240
Congratulations.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.240
34 years young.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:56.120
34, and I still get carded for DVDs.

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.120
Rock.

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.120
There you go.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:05.000
So, and I have to say, for all of you people who were in your late teens and 20s and are

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
whining, shut up.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.440
It gets better at 30.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.440
It really does.

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.440
It really does.

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:11.360
I was really dreading 30, but 30 has been awesome.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360
So far.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.360
Seriously.

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.360
So far.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.360
It's like-

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.360
Did you hear that, Loki?

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.360
Life gets better at 30.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.360
How do you feel about that?

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.360
Loki's not 30 yet.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.360
He shrugs.

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.360
Almost there.

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.360
Yeah.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.800
Well, I mean, because it's sort of like you hit this level, like right when you were in

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:31.360
your early 30s, that's like all this little drama crap stops mattering.

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:34.800
Like, why was I worried about that?

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.240
Why do I care?

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:39.460
And it's like, okay.

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.460
So right.

01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:41.920
The least that has to happen with me.

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.720
I stopped caring.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:44.720
I don't know.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:47.480
For me, I just found I got laid more in my 30s than I did in my 20s.

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:48.480
You know?

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.480
Just saying.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.480
I'm kidding.

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:51.480
I'm kidding.

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:52.480
No, I'm not.

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.480
All right.

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:58.240
I just want to wake people up and make sure people are really paying attention.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.240
All right.

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.600
And there's, oh, everybody in chat is saying like, oh, I'm 27.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:02.600
I'm 31.

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:03.600
I'm 23.

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:04.600
There you go.

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:05.600
I'm waiting.

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.000
I'm waiting for, where's, where's the, like, uh, God, don't we have like a 14 year old

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
that listens?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Cheeseburger.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
How's cheeseburger?

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Cheeseburger.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
I think it's 15 now.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I think it's 14.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.800
I was like, oh my gosh, your parents know what you're doing.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.800
And then now what?

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.800
DS master's really young too, isn't he?

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:18.800
Yeah.

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.800
But you know what?

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.800
It's all good.

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.200
Well, and you know, and the reason I can, I can actually get away with saying this because

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:28.880
no matter how much you deny the whole, oh, I'm too old for the drama stuff when you're

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:29.880
in your twenties.

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.920
No, it still bites you.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.600
I thought I was over it.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.200
You're only as old as you feel.

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.600
Age ain't nothing but a number and a biological function.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.600
All right.

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:41.600
Anyhow.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.640
So let's get into some, uh, gaming news back to game news.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.640
Uh, Loki.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.640
Yes.

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.920
Quick, quick stuff.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:51.600
A lot of, actually, believe it or not, I had a hard time kind of picking and choosing the

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.440
stories for tonight because there was actually a lot of good stuff to talk about.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:57.080
So some of the stuff that we really should be spending like a long time talking about

01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.600
got pushed to this segment.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.920
So some quick stuff tonight.

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:01.920
Yeah.

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:05.280
So, uh, the PlayStation move, you may remember it has a controller.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:08.800
That's sort of like the nunchuck, but not the nunchuck.

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:16.040
Well, anyways, um, this was recently discovered in FCC, um, trademark that the new controller

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.520
will be called the navigation controller.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:27.800
So the navigation controller to the Sony move will be what the nunchuck is to the Wii remote.

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.800
Awesome.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:36.280
Uh, and then apparently Lost Planet 2 is getting some more, um, secret guest characters that

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:41.080
you'll be able to, um, play as, including a man who has covered wars.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:48.520
Uh, Frank West will be returning from Dead Rising, including a giant teddy bear backpack

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:51.160
that he will be, um, I guess carrying.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:57.080
It's kind of really cute how the teddy bear holds his extra, you know, assault rifle.

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.840
Um, that's neat.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:03.040
And then of course, um, there's going to be a guy from Monster Hunter as well.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:10.160
Um, they're referring to him as the scaly knife gun dude, but, um, that's pretty cool

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:15.440
that they have all these, I love the fact that they gave Frank West to teddy bear, all

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:21.620
the Frank West and the mega man outfit would have been a plus, just saying, well, Hey,

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:22.620
we can dream.

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:25.560
Maybe they'll have alternate costumes or something later on, by the way, just real quick.

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:29.080
I don't mean to derail you low key, but I had to issue a correction here because this

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:30.640
is very important.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:34.200
Cheeseburger is actually in chat right now wants to clarify he turned 16 on Valentine's

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:38.000
day, but he's been listening to OLR for four years.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.960
So you do the math and I'm just like, Oh my God.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:48.560
But then again, you know what, when I was 12 when I was your age cheeseburger, Oh God,

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.560
I'm that guy.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:55.640
No, but for real, I was calling into BBSs on my modem when I was 12 and posting on message

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.600
forums and talking about tons of shit I a 12 year old shouldn't be like reading or talking

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.600
about.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:07.040
But all I have to, I, I just hope your parents know it's an R rated show, but I don't think

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.600
we're a bad influence.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:12.600
I like to think we teach you, you know, how to think for yourself and how to, uh, how

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.600
to write, write proper emails.

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.600
Yes.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.600
You've got your grant.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:28.560
Seriously, you've got politics, nutrition, um, speech, debate and grammar and hand-eye

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.000
coordination above all from video games.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
All right.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Anyhow.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Sorry, Loki.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000
All right.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.320
And then, um, other fun stuff we can be talking about here, of course, um, pillow fight girls,

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.200
a game that will be coming to the iPhone very soon.

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:52.320
And um, it features scanly clad women and having pillow fights.

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:57.760
Apparently it will be a lot of people actually, apparently it'll be a reprise of the 2007

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:05.760
Java hit sexy girls, but of course getting the more PG 13 rated, um, title pillow fight

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.760
girls.

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:07.760
Yeah.

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.760
Well that's because, uh, didn't, uh, Apple crack down on a lot of those borderline porn,

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.600
the soft core titles, if you will.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600
Yes.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.640
But, uh, they are scanly clad and well endowed.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.280
Well, there you go.

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.280
All right.

01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.280
Pillow fight girls.

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.120
In other words, half naked and big boobed.

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.320
That's the more, I guess that was a politically correct way of saying, I don't like to be

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.320
politically correct.

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.320
I know you don't.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.280
Another thing she teaches on this show, how to say it plain, uh, a little big planet too

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.160
might've been inadvertently confirmed.

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:45.680
Uh, that's because musician Christopher Leary, who go by, who goes by the pseudonym Ochere

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.280
announced on his Twitter.

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280
Here we go.

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280
Twitter breaking the news.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.360
Again, his song infotain me has been licensed to Sony for little big planet too.

01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:58.520
This is not the first time it's been accidentally mentioned that little big planet too exists.

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.720
Here's a clip by the way, what this song sounds like.

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:09.760
Let me skip in a little ways here and hearing this, it does sound very little big planet.

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.600
I could see this in like a watery level or something.

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.360
Well, here's the thing too, everyone's like, Oh my God, they're doing a sequel.

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:22.760
It could very well just be a big old dialogue content pet that they do and add like a whole

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.520
new story mode with levels and stuff because they've already said they're not doing a sequel,

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.040
but it doesn't mean they can't release a new level pack that basically has an entirely

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.120
new storyline to go with it with new features.

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.520
I think they could do a sequel.

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.640
They could get away with it and not look like jerks.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:43.220
I think they've supported the first one so well that they honestly, the paintball gun,

01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:48.640
the water, all of that could have been a sequel and I think they would have been able to justify

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.400
having that and selling, you know, the game for 40 bucks or whatever.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.640
But uh, you know, I, if they're doing a true sequel with all new media molecule levels

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.960
and a couple of new elements, who knows what will be in it.

01:39:58.960 --> 01:39:59.960
I think it's okay.

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.440
I'm not going to get mad at him for saying before they weren't going to do a sequel because

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.480
you know what?

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.840
I think they resisted the temptation long enough.

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:11.080
But again, I would hope that there's enough here to really justify that big two in front

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.080
of it.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.040
But, um, I, you know, media molecule really didn't disappoint with the first game.

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.240
I have faith, but maybe that's just me.

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.480
Are you saying you would not support a little big planet to Loki?

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.480
No, sure.

01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:24.480
I'd pick it up.

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.480
It was awesome.

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:26.480
I would too.

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:27.480
It was my favorite game in the year it came out.

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:28.480
So, all right.

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.480
This, uh, it might be a worth picking up too.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:30.480
Super Mario Galaxy two.

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.160
Of course the first game was really amazing and I think a lot of people kind of forget

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.120
that like it's a really great Wii game.

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.240
Super Mario Galaxy two is on the way.

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:40.980
And of course Super Mario Galaxy brought us B Mario.

01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:41.980
How rad was that?

01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:42.980
Right?

01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:43.980
B Mario was actually really cool.

01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:47.280
Um, right up there with like Tanooki suit Mario, maybe not as cool as Tanooki suit Mario,

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.280
but almost.

01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:53.960
Well, Super Mario Galaxy two is trying to up the cute and, uh, the memorable Mario forms.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:58.400
Cloud Mario is going to be one of the new Mario forms in Super Mario Galaxy two.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.800
So you mean he's going to be angsty and have a big sword and ride a big motorcycle club

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:03.800
thing?

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:04.800
No, not that cloud.

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.800
Like a happy fluffy cloud.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:06.800
Like a Bob Ross cloud.

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:07.800
Bob Ross, Bob Mario.

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:08.800
Yes.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:09.800
He's a Bob Mario cloud.

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:10.800
Bob Mario.

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:11.800
There you go.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.880
Uh, he got like these white overall looking things on instead and, uh, what he can do

01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:18.940
with this power, he creates cloud steps.

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:22.160
He walks on them and can get to out of the way places.

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.160
By the way.

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.280
Um, there's also a rock form Mario in case you forgot.

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:27.320
So there are some new forms of Mario coming to the game.

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:28.320
That sounds kind of cool.

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:29.320
Actually.

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:31.760
I gotta say cloud Mario makes me kind of think of metal Mario from Mario 64.

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:32.760
Hmm.

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:33.760
I forgot about middle.

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.400
All right.

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.720
This one's a little interesting.

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:41.220
This story and we could probably have a much longer discussion about this, but I thought

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:44.820
the quote was worth talking about here and it's something I don't think everybody's really

01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:51.560
thought about and that is how do you handle in a game like Def Jam rap star, the N word

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:55.960
and you know, cause a lot of rap music uses that word.

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.800
There's a lot of people that aren't comfortable saying that word.

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:04.140
So how do you kind of address this in the development of your video game?

01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:07.880
And there's this very interesting article and I'll give credit to Destructoid who I'm,

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:11.720
I'm actually reading this from and stealing the article on that tries to kind of tackle

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.360
this topic here of this.

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:17.780
Now Konami, Def Jam, 4MM games, all the people that went into producing this game, they're

01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:21.240
using radio edits for the songs and the music videos and so forth.

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.120
So I think that way you kind of skirt around the issue.

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:30.780
But actually the N word is, is, is one that kind of shows up still.

01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:34.300
So they put in dashes for most foul words.

01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.480
But they find that when people are playing it and this, this, this guy who wrote the

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.280
article for Destructoid is talking about, you know, when I was playing it, I, I was

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:46.400
okay with saying when I saw F dash dash, I would say, fuck S dash dash, I would say shit.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.320
When I saw N dash dash, I didn't really want to say that word.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.000
And so the guy at Destructoid went to Jamie King, who is the chief creative officer for

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.280
4MM games and got this quote in return.

01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:02.600
And I thought this was worth sharing because you really have to think like, how do you,

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.380
how do you, you know, there are some people that play rock band and even the rock band

01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:06.380
uses the radio edits.

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:10.040
Some people don't want to sing the fuck and the, you know, the, the, they're in some of

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:11.040
the songs, right?

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:16.160
It actually made it really hard for me to sing a, a fallout boys song, um, the scene

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.360
is seen it's an arms race, right?

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.120
Cause I'm, so you're just singing it in the car on the radio that I just automatically

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.120
enter.

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.960
I'm like, it's throwing me off.

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.380
It's scoring me down.

01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:29.600
So anyway, here's a quote I wanted to share.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.960
We don't have ownership of that word as white people of that word.

01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:38.320
I think that word does come up and that is perhaps a word where with the radio edits,

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.220
there is an opportunity to not say it.

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:43.660
We certainly don't make it a central part of the story or the career mode.

01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:47.720
That is a very personal decision in that point in time, regardless of race, creed, and color

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:52.440
as for how you use that word in the context of the song, obviously these artists are using

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.440
it.

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:56.780
They've empowered it and own it to just shy away and be frightened doesn't mean we should

01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:57.880
abuse it.

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:01.840
And hopefully I think we've treated it in a respectful manner, the way all these artists

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:08.020
and their content in their work would expect us to very well thought out point on, on what

01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:10.680
is a very tricky otherwise issue.

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.760
I just still like what Chris Rock said about it.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760
What?

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:19.040
So if you're, if you're a white person in your car listening to Dre, go ahead, say it,

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.840
go ahead and sing your Dre.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:27.000
But no, um, well I told you about, and actually I found a comedian recently, I think it was

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.460
Brian Reagan, but back when I was hanging out with somebody else, we used to just go

01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:34.360
around doing the white version.

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.360
Yeah.

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:36.360
Right, right.

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.680
And it was, we just did it because we thought the whole thing was, was kind of ridiculous

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.680
and funny.

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:47.800
So, well, I mean the, or the origin, but now being pulled into common usage, there's only

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:53.360
thing that's fine to take something and you know, take something that was, you know, made

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.900
for, well, okay, here's another example to rephrase better.

01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:59.600
The triangle, the big gay triangle.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.600
You know where that came from?

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:01.600
I do.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.120
That came from, uh, the concentration camps in Germany.

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.260
The triangle was used to denote that they were in a concentration camp for being gay,

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:12.080
but now it's a symbol of pride, right?

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:19.460
So I say that if you can take something that was a sign of, you know, oppression or disrespect

01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:22.840
and make it something that you can, you know, to bind everyone together, say, hey, this

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:26.600
is where we came from, this is us now, then I have no problem with it.

01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:32.400
I actually would be bothered if it was taken out of the game used in that context.

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.400
You know what I mean?

01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:34.400
Mm-hmm.

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:35.400
All right.

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:36.400
Well, that's all I had.

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.560
No, no, it's, it's, I thought the quote was worth sharing.

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:43.480
It's a touchy, tricky subject, but I thought it was a well thought out quote, especially,

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.400
you know, with game design, sometimes you have to approach these, it's just interesting

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:52.820
that a freaking video game, you have these sometimes very deep cultural questions that

01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:56.760
you kind of realize like, oh, I'm going to have a lot of people paying attention to this

01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:57.760
game.

01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:58.760
How do we kind of approach this tricky topic?

01:45:58.760 --> 01:45:59.760
Yeah.

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:03.000
You know, and that might go, and that's not just with words necessarily, but maybe images

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.200
and violence and, you know, sex and whatever else.

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:07.200
I say it comes down to this.

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.480
If you don't like it, don't play the game.

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:10.480
Fair enough.

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.480
All right.

01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.480
Sorry, I didn't mean to make a long topic out of a short story.

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.760
No, no, but I, I, I'm glad that you brought that one up.

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:15.760
All right.

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:16.760
No problem.

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.760
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:18.760
Oh, I got stuff.

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:24.560
Um, Rock Band, we, um, no, not only, um, but it's actually stuff that makes me very happy

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.060
because it's a bunch of stuff that I like.

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:31.200
There's, um, go heat in Cambria pack coming out with, with guns of summer, the, the, the

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:39.280
guns of summer, we, um, here we are juggernaut and the broken, um, the pack for, uh, 440

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:40.280
points.

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:46.560
Um, well, Microsoft points, um, or 200, we points each are 160 Microsoft points each.

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:53.020
And then, um, individual traffic, traffic tracks guy, I can't tell today are all songs

01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:54.020
that I like.

01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:58.600
There's Susie and the Banshees, peekaboo fuck yes.

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.320
We needed more Susie and the Banshees on a rock band.

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:04.440
There's a three pack out there, but peekaboo was like their biggest mainstream song.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:05.440
I think.

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.080
So I'm kind of surprised that wasn't in the first group, um, super grass, sun hits the

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:09.080
sky.

01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:10.080
I love super grass.

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.660
Um, and the violent femmes, American music and the ones that are going to be on Lego

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:19.440
rock band, our guns of summer, the broken and a sun hits the sky, the super grass song.

01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:21.200
Also more stuff.

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:26.840
Um, Lord of Ultima, um, is, uh, the, the browser version MMO.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:27.840
Oh, sure.

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:30.360
Let me get away from the glue.

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.360
Sure.

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.360
Sure.

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.360
She's like, what's this glue?

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.360
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.360
Uh, don't like it.

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:38.840
Um, but there is a beta, um, on for this, so you could play it, but it's coming out

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:39.840
a week.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:40.840
So whatever.

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:45.640
Um, but it's, uh, Lord's of Ultima coming out April 20th, Tuesday.

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:47.040
Oh, that's not a week.

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.040
That's a couple of days.

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:50.040
Anyway.

01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.960
Also iPhone games, uh, Street Fighter four gets a new challenger.

01:47:54.960 --> 01:48:00.760
You get Kami for free Kami in her butt.

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:02.920
That's it for free.

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.840
Is that, are they doing like a version upgrade or something?

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.760
I guess it must be interesting.

01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:12.880
All right, well let's go to the Twitter and uh, every week we take your Twitter topics.

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:18.220
You can follow us on Twitter at O L R and send us messages and uh, we post little reminders

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:22.240
about when the show is posted and when we're going to go live and uh, sometimes especially

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:26.160
the real big time to be following O L R on Twitter is when we're at shows because we

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:31.760
will like post pictures and take questions and I remember last E3 I was just like, okay

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:34.380
Twitter people, what do you want to, what do you want to see today?

01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:38.280
And I uh, let people basically, I was everybody's bitch on the internet.

01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.280
It was fun.

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.280
Good times.

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:43.960
Anyway, let's go to the Twitter questions and uh, see what you guys have for us tonight.

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.840
Not a whole lot, but some good stuff.

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:53.800
The shadow sniper on Twitter says, what's a good 32 inch HDTV for gaming max $550.

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:58.340
So he's setting kind of a lowish limit, but I'm assuming maybe shadow sniper has saved

01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:02.440
enough money that maybe they want to go purchase a TV.

01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.280
I'm making a guess.

01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:08.980
I have a 52 inch, um, I think mine's a Samsung.

01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:12.160
So and we got ours for about 1200 so do the math.

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:18.440
You can find, you know, a good, you know, 20 something, 30 something inch for around

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.440
there.

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.440
Right.

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.440
Samsung makes good stuff.

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.440
I also, I wouldn't, well, I would say, I can't tell you like a brand name and whatever right

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.280
off the top of my head, but let me give you a few things to look for because you're shopping

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.440
on the cheap end of things, a couple of things to look out for.

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:36.880
There's a lot of HD TVs that are sold, but they're only 720 P and that's fine.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.600
It's a good quality picture, but just keep in mind it's not 10 80 P or it's not even

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.920
10 80 I, my TV, however, is 10 80 I only and it works just fine.

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.160
Like I don't, like there's been some times where I'm like, Oh, I should get a 10 EP,

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.420
but then I'm like, why?

01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:53.440
It's not really going to be that big a difference.

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.760
You know, there's no difference.

01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.480
So I've had, I have both, but do you think there's a difference between seven 20 and

01:49:58.480 --> 01:49:59.480
10 80?

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.200
See, I would say that you could probably tell a little bit, it looks a little blurry or

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:08.080
it's not quite as, you know, um, Chris, but 10 80 I and 10 AP, if seriously, if you're

01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.280
flipping between the two, you'd never be able to tell the difference.

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:15.760
Uh, I think ours is a 10 80 P, but you know, again, SSJ 100 Matt says, all I can say is

01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.560
don't get a Phillips and get a warranty.

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:19.840
Ziba in our chat says, Vizio is cheap and okay.

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:24.920
I have a Vizio and I got it from a Costco, which I think is a great place to buy TVs.

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.080
You know, they've revoked the, the constant return.

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:30.720
I heard, well, people were probably abusing the hell out of it.

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.440
I was like, what took them so long?

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:33.880
I'm glad that we got our TV.

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:36.880
They still have some, they still have some type of return policy, don't they?

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:41.440
Yeah, but it's not the free returns for life, a free upgrades for life pretty much.

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:42.440
Yeah.

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.440
So that's good.

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:44.440
I'm glad they got rid of that.

01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.440
They needed to.

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:46.440
All right.

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:47.440
Uh, oops.

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:50.320
I was looking to let you put it this way.

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:54.560
Um, Oh, wait, shadow sniper sent us that tweet twice and I got thrown off.

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:55.560
Sorry.

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:56.560
Oh yeah.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:00.120
Look, you know, I was going to say, um, refurbished stuff also is not bad.

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:05.440
We had a, our first HDTV was a refurbished, uh, I don't remember what brand it was now,

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.320
but I think make sure it's factory refurb, right?

01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:08.320
Yeah.

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:11.040
It was factory referred, but the only really difference between that and the current model

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:16.640
is it didn't have an HDMI port, which I could care less cause I don't really use it.

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.920
Um, I do now I use it on my PlayStation three because I just don't want to have to swap

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:25.160
HD, uh, components stuff, but I mean, you could, if you really want to, you could get

01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:28.440
like a converter for that, but it's not a big deal.

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:34.000
But um, you know, we got ours, I think is for $800 a while back, but you know, I've

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:41.520
now have a Sony, a 40 inch, um, uh, Bravia, I think it's not bad.

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:42.520
Shadow sniper.

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.520
I hope you're in chat.

01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:46.140
I don't see your name unless you're on something else in chat, but there's like all the chatters

01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:47.440
are jumping in here.

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:51.440
Uh, cheeseburger says I got a 24 inch as Seuss from new egg.

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:53.240
It's 10 ADP and I love it for gaming.

01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.240
Dude.

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.240
You're 16.

01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:56.240
How did you get that?

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:57.240
He must have a job already.

01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:58.240
I don't know.

01:51:58.240 --> 01:51:59.240
Or, or got some money from the parents.

01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:00.240
I don't know.

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:01.800
Uh, act F says 32 inch.

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:03.060
You're not going to notice a difference.

01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:05.400
And Weiland says I have a 10 ADP, 42 inch sharp.

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.400
I got it for $500.

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:07.400
Whew.

01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:10.120
Maybe I need to get in the market for a new TV now.

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:11.120
Here you go.

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:12.120
I've had mine for a while.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:21.240
Um, they have a viewsonic 32 inch 1080p LCD HDTV on new egg for $499.99, $40 for shipping.

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:24.680
And Sharon says I'm still running the same SDTV I have for five years.

01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:25.680
It does what it needs to.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.800
Or actually they also have another Toshiba that's our Toshiba one that's actually also

01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:33.200
10 ADP, $5 shipping though on that one.

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:39.560
So I'd say that's probably the, uh, the best, uh, or cheapest one you're gonna find.

01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:44.320
Actually let me, let me get into some of the, Loki's just shopping on newegg.com.

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.320
Check it out.

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:49.480
Uh, the other thing too is actually watch, um, sellout.woot.com.

01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:50.480
Oh yeah.

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:51.480
And Woot.

01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:52.480
Oh yeah.

01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:53.480
Woot will have some good TVs.

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:54.480
It's $5 shipping.

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:55.480
Exactly.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:56.480
$5 shipping.

01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.480
That's where I need to buy a new TV is woot.com honestly.

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.480
Keep an eye out.

01:52:58.480 --> 01:52:59.480
Okay.

01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:00.480
We've got to get some other tweets.

01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:01.480
One last little one.

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:02.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:03.480
Best Buy.

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:04.480
Uh huh.

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.480
Look in their returns.

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.240
A lot of times stuff's brought back because it's just dinged on the side or something.

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:10.800
If you don't care about what it looks like on the outside of it, you can get a good deal.

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:15.840
We got our refrigerator for like 300 bucks off and our dryer for like two thirds the

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:16.840
cost.

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:17.840
Oh wow.

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.840
Because they were just dinged.

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:19.840
Awesome.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:20.840
So.

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:25.640
Uh, Surtur on our Twitter says, playing Harvest Moon Friends of Mineral Town on my GBA, waiting

01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:28.320
for Harvest Moon Hero of Leaf Valley to come out on the PSP.

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:30.680
I guess that's a little bit of his gaming week right there.

01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:31.960
Harvest Moon.

01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:34.120
I'm surprised that's a series I didn't get more into.

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:35.120
I don't know.

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.240
Uh, Tiger Claw says there's some links on Twitter.

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:40.760
Uh, this one was originally in the show roll and I bumped it for something else that I

01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:41.760
wanted to talk about more.

01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:43.280
Uh, it was about No Doubt.

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:48.760
And uh, apparently No Doubt, uh, they have won the first few um, skirmishes in the battle

01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:49.760
with Activision.

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:54.080
Uh, I guess Activision wanted the thing thrown out of court because it was a lawsuit without

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:55.080
merit.

01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.080
But guess what?

01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:57.080
The Los Angeles County Superior Court.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.960
They ruled in favor of No Doubt.

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:04.440
So they rejected the shift to a federal court and rejected Activision's, uh, efforts to

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:07.840
try and put free speech in, uh, free speech injunctions involved.

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:09.720
I, I'm kind of not surprised by that move.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:12.520
I think, uh, No Doubt could have a very good argument here.

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:14.660
It's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out.

01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.720
I'd really love to see the contract they signed.

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:21.400
I mean, without being able to read that, I, I, it's hard for me to take sides in this.

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:25.720
So it's very interesting to see what's going to happen in court of law.

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.840
Also I think worthy of mention, Tiger Claw sends this on Twitter.

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:31.440
Starcraft 2, this is a very recent news.

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:35.000
Starcraft 2 has been given an adults only rating in South Korea.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:39.960
That, you know, if a game gets an adults rating over here, only rating over here, it can be

01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:40.960
kind of damning.

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:44.840
Uh, they, Blizzard was shooting for an over 12 rating in the country.

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:47.720
Originally they had been assigned an over 15.

01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:52.040
They sent a newer build of the game or something and now they got adults only.

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:53.520
No word on why.

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:57.280
Uh, joke all you want about the addiction level of the game, seeing as this is South

01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:59.880
Korea, but I don't think that plays a part in it.

01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:04.640
So, um, it might, it could, I don't know, but Blizzard's going to appeal it of course,

01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:05.640
and they'll probably get their way.

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:10.480
I mean, it's that the release of that game is going to be like a cultural event over

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.480
there.

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:16.480
I mean, it's, it's, it's on the scale of a, I don't know, what are the huge releases here?

01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:22.600
Modern Warfare, Halo, Final Fantasy type release, obviously, um, Spassinator says, uh, I guess

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:25.840
for tonight's show, the show has been renamed orange bra radio, huh?

01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:27.080
Maybe that's what we need to sell.

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:28.080
Dark soccer.

01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:29.080
We should look into that.

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:33.920
Bras that are orange for the lady fans of the show with OLR right on the cups.

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:34.920
All right.

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:35.920
All right.

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:39.120
Uh, red entertainment says, uh, is there a reason why Activision hasn't created their

01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:40.760
own bank in real life?

01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:41.760
Sure.

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:46.400
It might be illegal, but that hasn't stopped companies before, uh, creating their own bank.

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:50.480
Do you mean like buying all their stock and there's, there's antigen.

01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:51.480
I don't know.

01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:56.080
I think he's being silly, but I don't know if I really get the joke, uh, sponge twang

01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:01.200
says to us on Twitter, let DS master 26 know I would take him up on his DDR perfect attack

01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:02.200
challenge.

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:03.200
LOL.

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.960
I only have access to songs on supernova too.

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:09.600
Well, you guys, you might want to try to find each other on Twitter and, uh, just YouTube

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.600
the battle.

01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:11.600
That's all we need.

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:16.080
Uh, did your Rama S is sending us a message saying, I don't remember you guys saying that

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.880
the slim X-Box three 60 was a fake.

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:22.720
I don't remember saying it either cause I thought it was actually a definitely a plausible

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:23.720
idea.

01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:24.720
I don't think it's fake.

01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:25.720
I don't think it's fake either.

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:27.360
Was it proven fake this week or something?

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:28.360
I didn't see it.

01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:29.360
It was.

01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:30.360
I missed it.

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:31.360
No, I don't think I haven't seen anything.

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:32.360
I it's real.

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.760
I mean, seriously, if something did happen, it'll be in chat soon.

01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:35.760
We'll see.

01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:36.760
All right.

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:38.480
Anyhow, let's get into some other gaming news.

01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:39.480
Uh, Loki.

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:40.480
Yeah.

01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:44.720
I was going to say it's, it's definitely happy.

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:49.240
Um, one thing that is not happening though would be PlayStation room.

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:50.240
What is room?

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:53.160
You may ask because you might've forgotten since they haven't really mentioned anything

01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:54.920
other than what it was teased.

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:55.920
I think.

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:56.920
I don't remember if it was Tokyo game show.

01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:59.960
I think it was Tokyo game shows where they showed it off anyways.

01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:05.240
Uh, PlayStation room was sort of like home is like a social networking service that was

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:09.320
going to be available for the PSP where he had little characters or avatars that kind

01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:18.040
of look like almost like, uh, me's or your avatars that you have on, um, on Xbox live.

01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:25.800
But um, apparently it, uh, finished the Japanese only closed beta and they decided that they're

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:29.360
going to cease development on the service.

01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:34.440
So Oh, well, I guess that's not coming.

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:37.720
They just pulled the plug because there just wasn't gonna be enough interest in it or too

01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:40.800
many resources or home didn't take off the way they wanted it to or why?

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:45.160
Because they're going to save it for the next nail PlayStation portable platform.

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.160
That's a darn good thought.

01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:47.160
I bet that's really it.

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:49.560
Uh, by the way, Rama wanted to clarify his tweet.

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:55.760
He sent us a link to a news article on xbox.com talking about the recent Xbox 360 slim images

01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:01.040
are fake and it shows a picture of a reported Xbox 360 slim and it's just an HD DVD player

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.440
tilted the wrong way.

01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:03.440
Okay.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.440
That's fair enough.

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.440
Yeah.

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:06.760
That picture is obviously fake, but that's not the same picture that came up on the show

01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:13.600
a couple of weeks ago, so it might be disputing this story is a fake, but I think pictures

01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:14.600
are not.

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:19.380
I still think the concept of the xbox 360 slim and just some of the things that were

01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:22.800
being talked about at that time, I think are certainly still plausible, although certainly

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:25.860
there are going to be many websites out there that claim to have it even though they don't

01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:29.560
cause they're lying liars.

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.560
I wouldn't lie to you guys.

01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:36.020
I have to make a comment from a Weiland because I posted a picture, um, one of the people

01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:42.840
I follow on deviantart, um, did, uh, a picture of Deadpool singing his own theme song, the

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:47.200
Spiderman theme song, and he said that Deadpool needs to be a Marvel versus Capcom three.

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.560
I agree.

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:52.840
And they need to get the people who did his stuff on Mugen to, to make him.

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:54.320
All right.

01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:55.800
So I have to agree to that.

01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:56.800
All right.

01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:01.120
Well, uh, let's talk about more PlayStation news and this is actually really important.

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:05.960
Uh, PlayStation news, they usually do the network updates on Thursdays.

01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:08.560
That is actually going to be changing.

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:13.000
And the theory is that this is actually part of the response to, um, actually why the Xbox

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.160
does their releases.

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:16.700
Uh, here's the deal.

01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:21.120
The American and European PlayStation store updates, they are moving starting in May to

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:27.240
new days and PlayStation network in North America will now be Tuesdays.

01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:29.480
In Europe it will be now on Wednesday.

01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:31.560
Uh, kind of interesting.

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:37.240
Uh, I think there are people out there that might buy games on Microsoft just because

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:40.100
they can get them two days before they do on PS3.

01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:41.100
Do you think that that's true?

01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:43.680
Loki, that there's people out there that buy games on 360 simply because you can get it

01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:45.080
like a two days before?

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:46.080
No.

01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:47.080
Really?

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.080
I doubt it.

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:49.080
Really?

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:50.480
It's just basically forum bragging rights.

01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:51.480
That's about it.

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:52.480
Huh?

01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:53.480
We eat the game earlier than you do.

01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:54.480
That's basically it.

01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:57.580
I think there is a small, it's small, but I think there's a group of people out there

01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:03.320
that knowing they can get the game, the game, the game a day sooner on the PS3 will opt

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:04.320
to get it on the PS3.

02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:05.320
Yeah.

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:09.720
And well, I guess they would be able to say, Hey, you know, you can get the game here first.

02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:12.680
You know, they can use that tagline or whatever.

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:13.680
Hmm.

02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:15.520
Well, there you go.

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:19.040
The updates are moving to be a little more competitive with Microsoft, although they

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:22.480
didn't say that of course in the update, but I'm sure they were like, Oh, we're doing it

02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:25.160
because we want to be earlier.

02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:26.640
I didn't watch the video of the release.

02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:29.940
All you need to know is that it's moving two days back and, and now it's going to get very

02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:34.360
interesting to see if that changes sales figures or not.

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:35.360
We'll see.

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:36.360
Hey Rob.

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:37.360
What's that?

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:39.080
Um, who was it that just posted that?

02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:40.080
Um, Ziba?

02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:41.080
Yes.

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:48.520
Put a deals.woot link in for a 42 inch, 10 ADP LCD HDTV with three HDMI inputs refurbished

02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:49.520
for $549.99.

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:50.520
Really?

02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:51.520
Yep.

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:52.520
Hold on.

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:53.520
I'm looking at this right now.

02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:54.520
Is it still like $5 shipping?

02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:55.520
It's Phillips.

02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:56.520
We were warned.

02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:57.520
We were warned about Phillips.

02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:58.520
I don't know.

02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:02.360
And I'm going to tell everybody, whenever you're going through any of these sites and

02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:06.480
everything, no, no, there were a few people who actually said they recommended that it

02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:07.480
was great.

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.480
Um, but always, always check consumer reports before you buy anything.

02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:12.480
Good idea.

02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:14.280
Especially before you spend that kind of money.

02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.280
Yeah.

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.280
Free shipping even.

02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:17.280
Interesting.

02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.280
It's tempting.

02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:21.960
There's people on here who said they did a good job with it.

02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:22.960
Interesting.

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:23.960
I don't have to think about it.

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:27.000
It's very anti Phillips though, I'll have to hear more about his story before I had

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
decided to do it.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
But thank you Zeba.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
I appreciate you looking out.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Kiss, kiss.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:37.120
And there's a $10 coupon off for, um, at buy.com.

02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:38.120
We'll see.

02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:40.160
I don't, I really, honestly, guys, I shouldn't be spending money on a TV.

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.160
You know what I really need to buy?

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:42.160
A new car.

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.960
And let's not even start that debate because everybody's going to try to sell me a different

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:45.960
car.

02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:46.960
I am pretty sure I know what car I'm getting.

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:52.840
Um, I just have to, uh, go get it, which hopefully will be soon.

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.840
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:54.840
Sakura.

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:55.840
Other stuff.

02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.840
Dun, dun, dun.

02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:00.800
Um, this is actually really sad news.

02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:09.560
Um, Sega has made a business decision and they are closing half of their GameWorks arcades

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:19.920
that, um, they, uh, are, you can't, no more good beer, no more good, God, they had good

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:20.920
food.

02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:27.360
Um, they're not saying which exactly ones are going to be closing, but, um, they're

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:33.160
going to be, uh, closing, uh, seven, actually, well, less than half, but just under half,

02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:35.280
seven of the 15 locations.

02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:39.840
Some of them being Minneapolis, Long Beach, Columbus, Detroit, Indianapolis, Miami, and

02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:40.840
Tampa.

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:41.840
But Seattle will live.

02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:42.840
In theory.

02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:47.040
Well, this, I'm sorry, but this news story calls for a little bit of sad trombone.

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:50.960
There you go.

02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:53.760
Yeah, that's, that puts sadness into my heart.

02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:55.520
Well, it is sad.

02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:56.840
Arcades closing is sad.

02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:57.840
Whatever.

02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:02.140
I mean, I honestly feel like just when the past, like the lifespan of our show, we have

02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:05.240
literally watched arcades die.

02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:06.240
You know what I mean?

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:07.240
It's, it is sad.

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.240
It is sad trombone.

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.600
It's worse than sad trombone.

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:10.600
It's sad elephone.

02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:12.600
It's sad tuba.

02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:13.600
Yes.

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:16.960
It's just, I don't know, it's just unfortunate.

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:18.280
Because you know, we all met at the arcade.

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.640
I don't know if the show would happen if we had all met on Xbox live or something different.

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.400
You know, it's just, it's just sad that arcades are closing down.

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:27.400
I mean, it's not a surprise.

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:30.000
I hate that the arcades that we've met at is still open.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.800
It is, but it's, but it's different now.

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:34.200
You know, you go over there, it's just not the same.

02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:36.520
I haven't been there in years.

02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:38.120
It's weird.

02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.100
So all right, well, sorry to hear about the GameWorks closing.

02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:45.320
More sorry to hear about the people who lose their jobs because of it.

02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:46.320
That's the other big rumor.

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:47.320
Sad banana phone.

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:48.320
That's right.

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.320
Sad banana phone.

02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:50.320
All right.

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:51.320
Low key.

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:52.320
That would be what, the banana phone song in a minor key?

02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:53.320
Maybe.

02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:56.120
I've never heard, actually, is there a sad banana phone?

02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.320
Like you two, I don't have to hear this.

02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:00.640
No, Rob.

02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:07.760
So apparently the MPD numbers for March are out, and people are declaring Red Steel 2

02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:09.680
a flop.

02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:15.200
Apparently the game only sold 50,000 copies in its opening month.

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:17.520
Okay, let's stop it right there.

02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:23.160
Yeah, they sold 50,000 copies in the first, what, 12 days that it was out?

02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:25.160
14 days?

02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:31.520
So I wouldn't exactly call it a flop, but it is kind of on par with the other, the other

02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:37.760
Wii mature games, I guess, are out there, even though it is teen rated, but still.

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:41.080
I can confirm, though, it had, it did sell about 50,000 copies.

02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:48.240
It was like 49,000 and change, but I don't think it's actually going to be a flop, per

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:55.160
se, because I know copies are still being sold, and also, you know, it might be something

02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:58.120
people are picking up a little bit later on.

02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:02.880
I know the first Red Steel apparently sold over 100,000 copies in its first week, although

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:06.960
that you can attribute to the fact that the Wii just launched, and so everybody's picking

02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:11.080
up games for it, and Red Steel 1, you know, had the promise of being, you know, kind of

02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:19.920
what Red Steel 2 is, so I wouldn't say that's really a good comparison either, but definitely

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:25.480
it has been the trend that hardcore games, like Red Steel, haven't done well on the Wii,

02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:31.180
so we'll see if maybe this will break the mold.

02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:34.840
I guess it is probably too early to declare it a flop, but do you think there will be

02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:37.400
a Red Steel 3, or is it just too early to tell, period?

02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:40.520
Oh yeah, I'm sure there will be, and you know, here's the thing, it's like, the same thing

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:45.400
happened with DJ Hero, where they're like, oh, it didn't sell, you know, for shit, and

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:51.440
they really only had like, what, a week worth of data to go off of, so you have to just

02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:56.260
look at the amount of time that's, you know, passed, and where it's coming out in the month.

02:05:56.260 --> 02:06:00.600
If it came out, say, in the first week in March, then it would be a different story.

02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:05.080
Then yes, it would be almost a month, well, it would be over a month that had passed,

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:09.320
but those numbers would be reflecting at least most of the month, and yeah, that would be

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:15.640
a flop, but seeing that it came out kind of at the end of the month, I wouldn't really

02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:23.760
call it a flop yet, but once the April NPD numbers come out, then you can call it a flop.

02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:26.080
Alright, I don't think this is a flop.

02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:29.600
This sounds like it's going to be the truth, at least this website is placing all their

02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:30.760
stock into it.

02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:35.760
Planetxbox360.com is running a report saying that their tipster, who's been right 19 out

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:42.460
of 20 times, I like to know the one they were wrong on, but the tipster is saying that Capcom

02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:47.880
had its captivate press event over in Hawaii this past weekend, and apparently what was

02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:52.440
being shown at the event, well, final builds of Lost Planet 2 and Dead Rising 2, which

02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:56.640
is to be expected, but there were also some surprise announcements that happened at this

02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:01.420
event that you just haven't heard about yet, for whatever reasons, probably because the

02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:04.320
journalists are still coming back, or they are-

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:05.320
Embargoes.

02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:08.440
Yeah, embargoes for a certain day, absolutely, that's probably what's going on, because you

02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:09.720
know why they do embargoes?

02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:12.000
Well, I'll get into that rant in a minute.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Yeah.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
First off-

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.000
I know why they do embargoes.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Yeah, there's two reasons they do embargoes.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.720
We'll get into that in a minute, but first, the leaks that they're talking about, Marvel

02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:25.760
vs. Capcom 3 is supposedly going to be one of the games that comes out of this, running

02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:29.880
at a full 720p, actually, they have a little teaser art, I don't see Deadpool, but I can

02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:30.880
see-

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:31.880
No, that's not-

02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:37.680
Oh, duh, they wouldn't have the art, they would have to, yeah, of course, duh duh.

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:41.960
But anyway, it's gonna be a disc-based game, it is not Xbox Live Arcade, it is not PSN,

02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:48.480
it is full 720p for the games, which is typical for video games, apparently they spotted a

02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:53.600
Marvel employee at the event, the Twitter account for Marvel vs. Capcom popped back

02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:59.720
up recently, yeah, I mean, it all kinda seems like this is going on, they are just saying

02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:04.540
they're gonna blow fans out of the water with the sheer number of characters the game includes

02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:05.720
on the disc.

02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:13.440
It will be a 2D game, but think Street Fighter IV, like, Street Fighter IV had its 3D elements.

02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:23.240
As far as that goes, I can't see how that is not true, because, I mean, Capcom has been

02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:29.440
awesome at sucking the fanboy wank for the past couple years now, I mean, think about

02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:30.440
it.

02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:33.960
Think about the projects that Capcom's done, oh, we should do a Street Fighter IV that's

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:37.700
a little more inspired by Street Fighter II and it's like 2D, but, okay, is that what

02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:38.700
you want, guys?

02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:39.700
You got it.

02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:43.160
Oh, you want a new Mega Man game that's just like Mega Man 2 and the old school games you

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:44.160
love on the NES?

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:45.840
Okay, guys, you got it.

02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:46.840
What?

02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:51.560
You want us to remake Bionic Commando and make it all souped up for Xbox Live- oh, okay,

02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:53.400
you crazy kids, you got it.

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:57.520
Like, really, I mean, hasn't Capcom almost more so than any other company as of late

02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:01.080
been like, fanboy wank, you want it, you got it?

02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:04.400
Well, because they know if there's a cry for it, people are gonna spend money on it.

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:07.200
Exactly, and what is the next thing people have been crying for?

02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:08.480
Marvel versus Capcom.

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:12.560
And the only reason people say it's not happening is because of agreements and deals and Marvel

02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:17.280
and da-da-da, but when Marvel's got all these movies they wanna do, right?

02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:18.280
What better time?

02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:19.840
Especially with Iron Man 2 coming out soon.

02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:22.200
You know who I want in it?

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:24.920
Howard the Duck.

02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:25.920
Maybe it's an unlockable character.

02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:29.200
Howard the Duck's a Marvel character, and he knows quack-fu.

02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:33.960
Dark Tetsuya says, uh, so more than the 56 that were in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, holy fuck.

02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:36.560
I guess so, if this is to be believed.

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:37.560
I don't know.

02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:43.680
I mean, I, again, it seems very logical, and why not.

02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:48.200
Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 also being shown at the press event, apparently.

02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:50.280
There I guess is not much about this.

02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:53.520
There was just a trailer that was shown, but apparently they're saying there will be more

02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:58.880
at E3 2010, but the big, big announcement was Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:00.740
So there you go.

02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:02.400
I guess you'll hear more about it this week.

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:05.600
Now, do we wanna go onto the topic of Embargos and why you're not hearing about this right

02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:06.600
now?

02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:07.600
Please do.

02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:11.820
Keep in mind, these journalists went to Hawaii.

02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:14.440
They didn't pay to go to Hawaii.

02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:18.400
Capcom paid for them to come out and go to Hawaii just to go to this event, and it probably

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:22.280
wasn't just the event, but there was probably some, like, hoo-ha fancy dinners and luaus

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:28.440
and all these other things that come with it, and, I mean, I don't know, there's a part

02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:31.320
of me that's kinda like, wow, that's almost, I don't know.

02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:34.400
You almost have to, you're gonna have to take reviews of these games with a grain of salt.

02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:38.960
Well, there's something also here, I'd just like to point this out, because this was on

02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:39.960
JoySig.

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.560
It was a little kind of note at the bottom.

02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:45.840
It says, editor's note, JoySig is not attending Captivate this year.

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:50.280
We determined that the perceived environment and the associated downtime of the event was

02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:53.400
not in accordance with our editorial policy.

02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:57.480
We expected to provide complete coverage of all the Capcom titles shown at Captivate during

02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:03.920
E3 this June, and then for more information on our policies, they have a link, and basically,

02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.880
I actually read through their policies where they don't keep any of the promotional stuff

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:14.480
that they give them the kind of, you know, wet the whistle, I guess, you know, just to

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:15.480
make...

02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:16.480
And they won't take trips and so forth.

02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:17.800
They won't take trips or anything, so...

02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:18.960
I can respect that.

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:23.800
I actually, I can respect that policy quite a bit, you know, and it's interesting because

02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:27.520
they ran the same story, right, about the leaks, and now they're not, and they're not

02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:30.680
held to any type of embargo because they didn't go to the event.

02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:35.480
But it's very interesting because, I don't know how much we should say about this, but

02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:40.400
the three of us, I believe all three of us, once went to a press event for a company,

02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:44.360
and we won't say who, but we went to this press event and it was embargoed, meaning

02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.920
we couldn't talk about it until, I believe, two days after the event.

02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:49.920
Yeah.

02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:51.800
Yeah, I want to say it was two days after.

02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:54.760
And we were like, okay, fine, that gives us the time to kind of prep what we want to do

02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:57.960
on it, and we want to do extensive coverage on some of these things that we saw at the

02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:58.960
event.

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:08.080
And the next day, big websites like oneup.com, I want to say GamePro, IGN, they all were

02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:13.400
suddenly running stories on certain games shown at this event, but each website was

02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:18.880
showing one different game.

02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:25.000
And we were kind of sitting here going, well, why did we do those embargoes then?

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.480
And it just, you know, kind of the realization was that, oh, these guys probably had sold

02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:35.480
exclusive deals with these companies to get the first coverage on the game, because you

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:40.400
know that if IGN is the first one that's going to run a news story on let's make something

02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:45.160
up, Capcom, Resident Evil, let's say Resident Evil 6 is announced, IGN has an exclusive

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:47.040
deal to announce Resident Evil 6.

02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:50.780
The deal is they'll say what the company wants them to say, and they'll get hits from it.

02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:53.960
It's kind of shady, this stuff that goes on.

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.440
Or they'll allow them to say later on, get a good deal on placing those giant splash

02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.840
ads that cover the entire background of their front page or something like that.

02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:08.200
Yeah, it's shady, but that's how the big boys do it.

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:14.400
Yeah, well that's why I'm perfectly fine with our show being off the radar, even if we suffer

02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:19.960
in the number of listeners because of it, although if a game company wanted to fly me

02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:23.000
to Hawaii to check out their game schedule, I'm not going to say no.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.860
I don't think we have that same editorial policy, but I think the general understanding

02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:30.400
is that we're going to be honest at the end of the day, period.

02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:34.960
But I can see where people might be like, oh, but you getting all this lavish treatment,

02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:37.320
you're going to have a biased opinion on the game.

02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:39.320
And that's why Joystiq has the policy they do.

02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:40.600
Not really, I can't imagine.

02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:41.600
I don't either.

02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:46.240
I've gone to events and seen games and said, you know what, they need to work on it.

02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:49.920
We've gone to Konami events, and there's a lot of stuff that we've been pretty negative

02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:50.920
about.

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:59.040
That's why we're not invited to Konami events anymore, probably.

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:00.480
You know what?

02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.680
Until you stop going to IGN4U News and until you stop going to the very first website that

02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:09.740
cracks all this information, this trend will continue, period.

02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:10.740
So I'll bet you what?

02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:15.480
I bet you some website beats the others to the punch on this news, assuming it turns

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:19.160
out to be true, which again, I'm sure it is.

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.420
This would make perfect sense for Capcom, period.

02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:24.480
This is more of a will Marvel let them do it question and answer.

02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.920
This is rumored to be revealed in a few weeks anyway, so.

02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:28.920
That's true.

02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:30.400
It was already going around.

02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:34.400
Oh, now some people are bringing up the whole Adartetsuya saying, I'm sure they were buying

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:35.400
the 10s.

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:36.500
They were going to give in their review.

02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:40.040
That kind of references the whole, um, oh God, what was it?

02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:41.040
It was a game.

02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:42.040
Kane and Lynch.

02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.040
Yes.

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:44.040
Kane and Lynch and GameSpot.

02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:46.880
And the guy ended up leaving over it and Gerstmann.

02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.880
Oh man.

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:48.880
Oh man.

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:49.880
What a mess.

02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:50.880
Act.

02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:53.240
F wanted to reiterate that Kotaku has a similar policy.

02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:54.480
I just, I missed it.

02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:55.480
Okay.

02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:58.400
I've been gone all weekend, but I'm sure there's lots of websites that have very similar policy.

02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:03.240
So then my question would be who went, I don't know, not everybody can be trusted.

02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:04.240
Somebody blabbed their mouth.

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:05.240
The planet.

02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:09.200
I didn't see anybody saying, Hey, we're going to captivate and we'll be talking about it

02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:10.200
because it's embargo.

02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:11.680
They can't say they're going well.

02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:12.680
Big Capcom news.

02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:20.040
As soon as I get home from Hawaii, anyhow.

02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:21.040
All right, let's move on.

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:23.680
Uh, we're going to get to the mailbag every week.

02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:27.360
You guys send us emails, mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we would like to crack

02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:32.120
open the mailbag and read them here on the air.

02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:35.160
Mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark Sakura dive in the mailbag head first.

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:36.160
Pull out some emails.

02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:37.160
You know what, Rob though?

02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:38.160
I have to say, you know what?

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:41.240
It sounded like you said you have to crap out.

02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:43.680
I did some of this is what you said.

02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:45.840
Why don't you crap out some emails star Sakura.

02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:47.800
How about you bite my butt, Rob?

02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:49.040
Not if you're going to crap out emails.

02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:51.720
You're the one who brought up crap.

02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:52.720
Okay.

02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:55.440
Dear OLR crew, long time, no email.

02:15:55.440 --> 02:16:00.160
So I figured I would chime in my thoughts regarding the shutdown of halo two Xbox life

02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:01.160
support.

02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:02.160
Really.

02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.160
I'm not that sad to buy it.

02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:06.440
Seeing how I've already moved on from the game, occasionally playing halo three online,

02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:09.560
but the enjoyment I got out of halo two actually wasn't from the online play.

02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:14.640
I remember back in the day when me and my friends used to schedule a halo party where

02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:17.760
everyone would bring a TV in their systems and play via system link.

02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.760
It was a freaking blast.

02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:25.500
You know, we used to do that Dan's bachelor party was a halo land party using the system

02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:26.500
link.

02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:28.820
Wouldn't it be nice?

02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:33.800
What would be nice is if bungee made a halo two map for halo map pack for halo three because

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:37.800
honestly the maps in halo three are boring in comparison, at least for me.

02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:41.920
Oh, how I long through the headshots on coagulation and the headlong once more.

02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:43.880
Thanks for reading Ospher.

02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:48.680
P.S. here's a link to a simple but really moving YouTube that you can watch in your

02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:49.680
own time.

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:54.920
It's a simple walk through the multiplayer maps the game set to songs from the halo two

02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:55.920
soundtrack.

02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:57.720
Ah, memories.

02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:00.640
You know, I'm such a bad, bad, bad gaming journalist.

02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:02.760
This is why I don't go to Hawaii.

02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:06.160
I forgot that the Xbox closure was this week, but to be fair, there wasn't anything I was

02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.360
playing regularly on Xbox.

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:08.360
I mean, yeah.

02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:12.160
Halo two I used to play back in the day, but most of the guys that used to play that together

02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:15.820
with me have kind of moved on to just other games in general, you know, be at halo three

02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:16.820
or what have you.

02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:17.820
So yeah, that's right.

02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:19.560
I forgot to shut down this week.

02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:21.240
Don't say fuck halos and thrills in.

02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:22.240
All right.

02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:25.400
Well, what bite my butt.

02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:26.400
You get trout slapped.

02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:27.400
All right.

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:34.100
Um, but the halo two, the guy, the emailer Ospher writes says, uh, why don't they do

02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:36.200
halo two maps on halo three?

02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:39.880
You do have to kind of wonder now the halo two is done and gone and what have you, as

02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:43.880
far as Xbox live goes, there's gotta be something they're going to do.

02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:47.920
And I know there's that rumor that, Oh, halo two will be an Xbox live arcade title.

02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:50.660
And of course there's those that saying, well, if you really want to play halo two, just

02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:54.760
system land it or play it on PC, but you got to wonder how they're going to kind of toss

02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:57.340
out the bone, if you will, to the halo two fans.

02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:02.240
And I think putting out the maps and halo three is actually a really good idea, especially

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:05.120
if you can somehow put in the halo two rules, I don't know.

02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:06.800
Or you just let it die.

02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:08.920
I don't know.

02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:09.920
We'll see.

02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:10.920
Maybe.

02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.400
But, uh, yeah.

02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:19.160
Rest in peace Xbox live on regular Xbox, but I am so welcome to now my friends list will

02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:20.160
hopefully very soon.

02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:23.080
I don't know when this is rolling out, but hopefully in the next couple of months after

02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:26.440
E3, I will be able to have a friends list with over a hundred people because I feel

02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:30.360
really bad because I have to delete people because new people will want to add me and

02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:33.600
I'm like, Oh yeah, I really want to have you on my list shit, but I have a hundred friends.

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:35.720
Okay. Who hasn't signed on in the past two weeks?

02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:42.120
I think I'm the studio's 54 of, uh, of Xbox live cause I'll just delete people because

02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:43.920
I've decided that they're not elite enough.

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:45.320
I just, I'm kidding.

02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:46.840
I just, I feel bad.

02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:49.920
If you're an OLR listener and I deleted you, I'm really, really sorry.

02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:55.520
It's just my list is full and I really, I am, but just people I know in real life and

02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:00.680
actually see outside of, you know, the internet get precedence, they get preference.

02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:03.160
But as soon as Xbox ups the limit, open season again.

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:06.640
I promise you can all at me and I'll add you back.

02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:07.640
Excuse me.

02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:08.640
All right.

02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:10.600
And this person's doing this just to annoy me.

02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:12.320
So thank you for messing with me.

02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.600
Um, yo, OLR, what up?

02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:21.080
This sentience is for number four, dark Sakura to read because I'm a bad enough dude to type

02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:28.760
like dis grammar and all around linguistics is not my for, not me forte anyway on serious

02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:29.760
business.

02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:30.760
I have a question for Loki.

02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:35.080
Is it possible to hook up mix slash soundboard up to an Xbox 360 controller and play sound

02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:36.680
clips over Xbox live?

02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:42.520
Cause when I play call of duty or any game with multiplayer in it, you're usually dealing

02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:46.320
with 12 year olds that one out of every two words that come out of their mouth is something

02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:47.640
not pleasant.

02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:48.640
Don't get me wrong.

02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:49.640
I love expletives.

02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:53.860
Like the fuck show was funny as shit, but not racial slurs or other bigotry.

02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:58.800
If I can get a soundboard, I would download a bunch of sounds and just fuck with people.

02:19:58.800 --> 02:19:59.960
Only dickheads though.

02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:04.600
Anyway, I got to go watch all the new stuff they added on Netflix like firefly.

02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:06.680
I heard it was really good until it was canceled.

02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:07.920
Well, bye bye.

02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:11.200
Duh money 125 and yeah, firefly is excellent.

02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:12.200
Watch the whole thing.

02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:14.120
They aired it out of order and they did it.

02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:17.360
They just treated it badly and then watch the movie seriously.

02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:21.720
Um, PS, this email is brought to you by orange knowledge radio, your number one source for

02:20:21.720 --> 02:20:24.320
news, previews, reviews, and talk for all things halo.

02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:25.320
Just kidding.

02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:29.200
Um, isn't that ironic considering the past email we just got?

02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:30.200
I know, right?

02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:31.200
LOLWTF.

02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:32.200
LOL.

02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:33.200
I don't know.

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:35.840
Loki, can you hook up a soundboard to, uh, the Xbox controller?

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:36.840
Yeah, of course.

02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:41.560
Again, um, all you would need to do is basically just get the right, um, connector to plug

02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:49.360
into your, you know, Xbox 360 controller, um, to out, you know, he'd basically just

02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:51.800
be running a cord for your PC or whatever.

02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:56.360
I guess PC probably be the easiest and a rain into your controller.

02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:02.640
Um, and you just need, uh, some sort of headset adapter and they actually do have, uh, one

02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:03.840
of those I think available.

02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:04.840
I'm looking here right now.

02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:09.340
It looks like in tech made one of those, although I'm not sure if that just plugs, uh, converts

02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:15.440
it to any headset or what, uh, that mean we could broadcast our show on Xbox live.

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.720
Like we can start an Xbox live party and then invite people in and we could actually broadcast

02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:19.720
our show.

02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:20.840
You can only have so many people in your party though.

02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:22.400
It's like four or something.

02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:24.840
I wish there was a way exclusive.

02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:28.440
Could we, could we like get, just get in a halo match and just stand there or stand where

02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:36.800
no one can, can shoot us somehow and just do our show on red versus blue style possible.

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:39.360
I think this though would work.

02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:41.240
Um, I'm not positive.

02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:44.960
It says it's an Xbox 360 headset adapter from in tech.

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:55.120
It says allow you to plug in any, um, uh, 2.5 millimeter Jack plug, um, and I think

02:21:55.120 --> 02:22:01.640
I got, I don't remember, you know, what size, uh, uh, Jack plugs there are for different

02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:02.640
things.

02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:08.300
Um, I'm sure though, seriously though, you can probably go online or even to like radio

02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:11.920
shack or something like that and just basically bring your controller with you and you can

02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:14.160
probably find some sort of an adapter.

02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:20.560
Or if you want, use this adapter with a converter to convert it to the correct, um, size that

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:21.560
you need.

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:25.920
So, um, and it does have like a volume and mute controls on there as well.

02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:29.960
So if you want to shut it off, so you know, you're not bugging everybody, you can do that.

02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:30.960
Hmm.

02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:36.120
I've wanted to do that as well cause I think it'd be funny just to play stuff over live,

02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:39.000
but uh, some people don't like that.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000
That's actually not the only way you can do that.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.320
There's another way you can actually do it, um, and I've seen it happen and I was going

02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:49.440
to call somebody to talk about it, but they're testing, I'll come back to this.

02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:51.000
I want to come back to this topic in just a minute.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.480
So DarkSakura, do the next email.

02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:54.960
Oh, we only have one more email.

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:55.960
Okay.

02:22:55.960 --> 02:23:00.560
So, um, moving forward, and haha, funny to money.

02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:05.120
Rob said something like, most DS owners are kids, and this is by the way from Robaba.

02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:08.720
At first I thought, no, but if you really think about it, what is the most kid friendly

02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:10.260
game console around?

02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:13.440
By kid friendly, think about these factors and not the M ratings.

02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:14.440
1.

02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:15.440
You can put it in your pocket.

02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:18.960
PSP Go and the iPhone slash iPod touch are the only others.

02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:22.320
The DS is the only system that protects its own screen without peripherals.

02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:23.640
Very pocket friendly.

02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:24.640
2.

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:25.640
Kids are destructive.

02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:26.640
Part 1.

02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:29.680
The portable system will probably get destroyed or lost at some point, which is the cheapest

02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:32.440
to replace, hence its initials are DNS.

02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:33.440
3.

02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:34.440
Kids are destructive.

02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:35.440
Part 2.

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:38.160
The games are solid state chips as opposed to UMDs.

02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:41.920
UMDs get crushed easily, whereas the DS chips survive most falls and step-ons.

02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:42.920
4.

02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:44.720
Parents are cheap.

02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:46.120
Most of the cheap games are on the DS.

02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:49.120
I'm still waiting for Imagine Having Fun.

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:50.120
5.

02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:52.160
DS has buttloads of simpler games for the very young.

02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:56.360
I have to admit I used these priorities to pick a DS over the PSP for the nephews when

02:23:56.360 --> 02:24:00.280
they were younger, so I'm inclined to believe you were right for your comment.

02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:02.400
Did I send this email back in 2005?

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:03.720
Kinda deja vu moment for me.

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:05.280
Of course I was right.

02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:09.360
Poor Jamie, I just wanted to jump through the internet time machine and buy her soup.

02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:10.360
Aww.

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:12.640
I hope you were surviving your allergies slash plague.

02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:13.640
Rubba buh.

02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:20.600
Um, yeah, it was funny, I had bad allergies, and then, um, I was sick, I ate a lot of cake.

02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:21.720
And beer.

02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:23.860
And then, um, yeah, I was actually sick.

02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:24.860
This time around.

02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:26.920
So, thank you Rubba buh.

02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:30.240
Thank you, and thank you for saying I was right, because more people should do that,

02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:31.240
actually.

02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:32.240
Say I was right.

02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:36.440
No, but I mean, I think you further just proved the point, though, is that, you know, all

02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:42.160
those things you named about how it fits in the pocket, you know, it's true.

02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:46.240
A lot of kids play those DSes.

02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:51.240
It'll be interesting to see how the three DS impacts things, if at all.

02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:53.200
But we'll see.

02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:58.920
If they're the right games for it, they might be, you know, it might pick up, you know,

02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:02.760
with the other crowds that are kind of into the more hardcore stuff.

02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:03.760
Was that it for emails?

02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:04.760
I said there were only three.

02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:05.760
That's it?

02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:06.760
We're done?

02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:08.480
Well, I wasn't listening to you, as usual.

02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:09.480
Mailbag?

02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:14.200
Do not, do not make me break out Shermie's butt for you to bite.

02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:18.280
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com She's just giving you an offended look right

02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:19.280
now.

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:20.280
Is she?

02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:21.280
Yeah.

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:22.280
I'm looking.

02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:23.280
Hey girl, how you doing?

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:24.280
Meow meow.

02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:25.280
She's like, bitch.

02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:28.200
Wait, let me see if I can get a picture of Shermie right now.

02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:29.200
Hold on.

02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:30.200
Someone fill time.

02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:34.920
I'm propping a logo right now because apparently people don't know the concept of sending me

02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:39.960
an individual zip, you know, a zip file with like, my logo's already JPEG-didded.

02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:41.960
So I have to do it all myself.

02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:42.960
No.

02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:43.960
Actually, I have no problem doing this.

02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:49.080
Rob is seriously taking a picture of this little fat butt down there, looking at him

02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:51.440
all offended, sitting on her little throne.

02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:52.440
I got a picture of it.

02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:55.760
I'm gonna totally, I'm gonna totally post that on the, uh, Orangeloungeradio picture

02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:56.760
feed here.

02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:57.760
Rob's gonna totally do it.

02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:58.760
All right.

02:25:58.760 --> 02:25:59.760
Look.

02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:00.760
Oh my God, Rob.

02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:01.760
Oh my God.

02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:02.760
I'm gonna totally do it.

02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:03.760
Okay.

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:04.760
Hold on.

02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:05.760
Because we're getting that call.

02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:06.760
I want to take this earlier.

02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:07.760
This is back on the email about how do I hook up the soundboard for the 360.

02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:10.200
So, um, I wanted to invite SSJ 100 Matt on the show to talk about this for a minute.

02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:11.200
And there's a reason why.

02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:12.200
Matt, you there?

02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:13.200
Oh yes, I'm here.

02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:14.200
How you doing, Matt?

02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:15.200
I'm doing good.

02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:19.720
Now, the reason why I invited specifically SSJ 100 Matt on the show is A, he's a cool

02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:23.880
guy, but B, no, the reason why, you might remember a couple of weeks on the show and

02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:27.120
maybe you don't remember because maybe you want to send the email if you remember this,

02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:32.040
but I was talking about, I'm just kidding, playing perfect dark with the folks on under

02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:33.040
sedation live.

02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:38.280
And it was the week that the, um, Xbox live had the release of perfect dark and it was

02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:43.200
like me and Alan were playing in one place and then, uh, Travis was playing and John

02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:44.200
was playing.

02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:48.200
And then some of our listeners that we have in common, like Matt, Misty and so forth were

02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:49.200
playing.

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:50.200
Well, okay.

02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:54.280
When Matt joined our game, hilarity ensued because Matt was playing these sound clips

02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:58.320
from like Duke Nukem and like, I don't know what else is in there, like probably old movies

02:26:58.320 --> 02:26:59.320
and stuff.

02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:00.320
Do we have my favorite one?

02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:01.320
What?

02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:02.320
Your face, your ass.

02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:03.320
What's the difference?

02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:04.320
Probably.

02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:05.320
Probably.

02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:06.440
I don't remember, but it was a hilarious epic match.

02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:11.200
So SSJ 100 Matt, you were somehow putting in sound clips and our email or what?

02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:14.320
Our email or wanted to trash talk 12 year olds or something like that.

02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:15.320
I believe.

02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:16.320
Okay.

02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:19.000
So SSJ 100 Matt, you didn't hook up a soundboard and all this stuff, did you?

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.520
No, you know, I didn't really didn't do anything that complicated.

02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:28.360
What I got was basically something that you could just buy like in the store.

02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:29.360
Hold on.

02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:30.360
You're really, really quiet.

02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:31.360
Can you get a little close to your microphone?

02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:32.360
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:33.360
That's all right.

02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:34.360
Ooh, much better.

02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:35.360
Yep.

02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:36.360
Yeah.

02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:41.680
Basically what I got here is a device called the Datel trash talker.

02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:42.680
I've seen that.

02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:44.280
It's actually called the trash talker.

02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:45.280
Okay.

02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:46.280
And?

02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:47.280
Yeah.

02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:52.600
And not to be confused with the knockoff version called the smack talker, which is crap.

02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:53.600
Okay.

02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:56.600
So you want the trash, not the smack.

02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:57.600
Very important.

02:27:57.600 --> 02:27:59.320
Yes.

02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:08.840
Basically what it is is a little device that connects directly into your Xbox 360 controller.

02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:13.560
It comes with software and basically in a USB cable it connects directly into your computer

02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:20.720
and basically you take sound clips, wave clips, MP3s and just drop it into each bank.

02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:31.000
Now it has four banks and four sets that you can use, but it also has a preset limit as

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
to what you can put on there.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:37.080
It doesn't say in the instructions or anything, but it will give you a small progress bar.

02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:39.640
You can't put long monologues and things in the buttons.

02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:41.640
There is a limit to the space on the thing.

02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:48.720
Yeah, you can, but you can only just take up more space on it.

02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:49.720
Gotcha.

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:52.360
So, I kind of want to get one of these.

02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:53.360
I do.

02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:54.360
I think I'm going to get one of these.

02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:56.040
But it's a great alternative to the sound board.

02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:00.660
You can just dump these files from your computer right onto the trash talking device, hit the

02:29:00.660 --> 02:29:03.360
button and drop in sound clips left and right.

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:04.840
Your very own personal sound board.

02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:05.840
Yeah, basically.

02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:09.580
I mean, I don't know how it sounds on the other people's end, but according to you guys

02:29:09.580 --> 02:29:10.580
it sounds really...

02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:11.580
It's hilarious.

02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:13.440
It sounds just like somebody's dropping the sound file in.

02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:15.360
Like I thought I was playing Duke Nukem for a minute.

02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:16.360
It's great.

02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:19.720
I think what I'm going to do, I'm going to get this, but instead of putting in clips

02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:24.160
from Duke Nukem and stuff, I think I'll go to the Disney channel and get clips from That's

02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:29.400
So Raven and play those with people when I'm playing shooting matches and stuff.

02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:35.720
But you know, it's funny, I mostly use it whenever I'm playing Mom Warfare 2.

02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:39.560
And whenever I play the Duke Nukem clips, a lot of the younger kids, they don't know

02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:40.560
who Duke Nukem is.

02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:41.560
They don't understand.

02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:47.640
So what they think is, they think it's some 40 year old guy who's smoked a packed cigarette

02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:51.920
since he was five.

02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:53.160
Just talking trash.

02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:54.160
That's great.

02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:55.160
I love this.

02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:59.080
Act Deft in our chat room just linked us to where you can buy this thing on amazon.com

02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:03.360
and I love I'm looking at the box art of this thing here and the guy's just got this grin

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:05.880
on his face.

02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:07.480
And it's trash talk.

02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:09.660
Taunt your opponents at the touch of a button.

02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:11.160
Don't get lost for words.

02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:12.160
It's bad.

02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:13.160
Oh, really?

02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:16.520
It has it available on Amazon.

02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:18.760
You can get it on Playasia.

02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:19.920
But you know, it's a little more expensive.

02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:22.620
I think I got it for like 15 bucks.

02:30:22.620 --> 02:30:23.620
Order in bulk though.

02:30:23.620 --> 02:30:24.620
Just go on eBay.

02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:25.620
I bet it's on eBay.

02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:26.880
And warning, it's a choking hazard.

02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:27.880
They're small parts.

02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:28.880
But you know.

02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:30.760
You know what, that was for real.

02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:32.240
Okay, well, Matt, I appreciate it.

02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:35.760
I know I asked you last minute to kind of hop on the show and tell us about that a little

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:38.240
bit, even though I think you might have mentioned on the show before, but whatever, obviously

02:30:38.240 --> 02:30:39.560
our emailer didn't hear it.

02:30:39.560 --> 02:30:41.600
So it was worth talking about again, because it was so damn funny.

02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:42.600
All right.

02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:45.560
Also, do you want me to mention about the Phillips thing or I'll just call back during?

02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:46.560
Oh, sure.

02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:47.560
What the hell?

02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:48.560
Why don't you tell us now?

02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:49.560
What's your rant on Phillips?

02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:51.160
The TV question we had earlier.

02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:56.800
Well, you know, basically like two years ago for my birthday, my father gave me an HDTV,

02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:58.680
Phillips HDTV for my birthday.

02:30:58.680 --> 02:31:01.800
And it had a warranty.

02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:08.360
But after the warranty expired, the TV basically crapped out a month after the warranty ended.

02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:12.320
So basically I had to call the Phillips, ask them what to do.

02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:14.840
They said, basically, it's out of warranty.

02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:18.880
We can't do anything about it.

02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:20.760
Tough shit, have a nice life, LOL?

02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:21.760
Basically?

02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:25.600
Yeah, pretty much, you know, they tell you to take it to a repair shop, you know, taking

02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:27.600
a HDTV to a repair shop.

02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:32.280
That's basically you're going to have to buy a brand new TV.

02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:35.920
That would irritate me to buy a new TV and then have a break just a year later.

02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:41.640
Yeah, but you know, the problem was, you know, it works now, but I have to let it warm up

02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:44.880
for half an hour before I could use it, which is a pain in the ass.

02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:49.640
But it turned out that the problem was there's a short, there's a short somewhere in the

02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:53.320
circuit board, which is common for some of their TVs.

02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:55.400
I don't know if it's common with their current stuff.

02:31:55.400 --> 02:32:02.320
I don't know, maybe they fixed the problem two years after the fact, but I mean, that's

02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:04.720
my problem with Phillips.

02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:11.920
All right, well, so noted, so I will definitely take that into consideration before I spend

02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:13.520
a lot of money on a television.

02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:16.320
But again, like I said before, what I really need to do is get the car.

02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:21.080
So when I get the car, then I'll worry about the TV because the TV I have is not bad.

02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:22.080
All right.

02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:23.080
But we have something for you.

02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:24.080
Oh, yes.

02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:25.080
Matt, before I...

02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:26.080
Oh, go ahead.

02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:32.680
Yeah, because I'm kind of in the same position, you know, an HDTV no matter how great it is,

02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:33.680
can't drive you to work.

02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:34.680
Exactly right.

02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:35.680
Exactly.

02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:38.160
Well, Matt, before we let you go, because we got to finish up the show, other people

02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:42.520
are calling in because they think it's a Skype segment now, oops, but before we got to get

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:45.720
back to the show, but I wanted to leave you with one little thing, Matt, before we let

02:32:45.720 --> 02:32:46.720
you go.

02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:47.720
Yes.

02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:54.080
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:55.080
Have a good night, Matt.

02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:56.080
You're welcome.

02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:57.080
Thanks.

02:32:57.080 --> 02:32:58.080
Thanks for letting us pick on you.

02:32:58.080 --> 02:32:59.080
All right.

02:32:59.080 --> 02:33:07.920
What's really hilarious is to get, like, what was it, that clip from Heavy Rain, Jason,

02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:09.480
Jason, Jason.

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:16.960
I remember, though, you used to be able to put your own voice macros in.

02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:20.600
You know, like, we did one, what are you, the poster child for abortion or something,

02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:21.600
you know.

02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:22.600
Anyway.

02:33:22.600 --> 02:33:29.060
What you need to do is also get, like, the CSI Miami, you know, that little musical bit

02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:31.320
there in the beginning of the song.

02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:32.320
Yeah.

02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:35.080
I wonder if this is the video, uh, that dark sucker might be referring to.

02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:58.920
I don't know if this is what video, oh, no, I was your partner, oh, that'd be awesome.

02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:03.400
Oh, these guys are filming the TV, it's not a direct feed, let me see if this is a direct

02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:04.400
feed here.

02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:05.400
This is the last one, I promise.

02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:06.400
Oh, fancy.

02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:07.400
Screw you.

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:08.400
Got some shoes for Sean.

02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:09.400
Can you watch Jason for a minute?

02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:10.400
I promise, he won't be long.

02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:11.400
Sure, no problem.

02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:18.400
Oh, God, we don't know where this is going.

02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:19.400
Jason.

02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:20.400
Jason.

02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:21.400
Jason.

02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:35.200
And there's a little X with Jason floating around, so I guess you just press X to say

02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:36.200
Jason.

02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:39.200
Jason, you really shouldn't want her off like that, you know?

02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:40.200
All right.

02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:41.200
You fail at parenting.

02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:44.320
That was, uh, that was a Flash game, too, press X to Jason.

02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:45.320
Was it?

02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:46.320
Jason.

02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:47.320
Loki.

02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:49.320
All right, there's the door, keep opening.

02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:51.640
Loki.

02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:52.640
All right.

02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:53.640
Oh, bye.

02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:56.960
All right, let's get into the FUs of the week, because sometimes we get a little angsty on

02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:57.960
the show.

02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:01.080
You know, when I can't find Jason, I get a little upset, so I want to do some ranting

02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:02.080
on the show.

02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:05.080
So here we go, the FUs of the week.

02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:22.800
FU to being pretty sick over the past few days.

02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:30.560
I feel a lot better today, although my voice is starting to go again, but I really, I really

02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:37.240
not like, I enjoy the projects I'm doing, but FU to this not being my job.

02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:41.520
You know, to me not being able to freelance full time.

02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:43.360
I need to be a design diva.

02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:48.840
They need to pay me for being awesome.

02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:52.040
If Lady Gaga can do it, so can I.

02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:59.680
If she can walk around and call herself performance art, I can put something on a piece of paper

02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:02.600
and be called a design diva.

02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:04.400
Would you get your own show called Designing Women?

02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:07.200
I'd be Designing Divas.

02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:08.200
Low key.

02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:13.120
That show would be more interesting if it was from the perspective of, say, a grand

02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:15.600
deity like God or something.

02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:16.600
Designing Women.

02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:17.600
Yeah.

02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:20.600
It would be a weird science.

02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:21.600
Weird science.

02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:22.600
Awesome.

02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:23.600
I like that.

02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:30.120
FU to my weed eater, or weed whacker, I guess, for shooting fire.

02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:34.960
Apparently, it's not supposed to be doing that, so it is now broken.

02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:38.040
It was very unfortunate that it...

02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:40.280
Weed eaters do not shoot fire, just for the record.

02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:41.280
That's not an added benefit.

02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:42.280
Pretty sure.

02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:47.360
There was a lot of smoke and then fire came out and I'm like, I think this is broken.

02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:54.680
So yeah, the engine overheated and melted down, so that's too bad.

02:36:54.680 --> 02:36:55.680
My FU of the week.

02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:56.680
I don't...

02:36:56.680 --> 02:36:57.680
Actually, things are pretty good right now.

02:36:57.680 --> 02:36:58.680
I can't complain.

02:36:58.680 --> 02:36:59.680
I don't have a lot of negative stuff going on.

02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:05.320
I will take this opportunity to take a tangent, though, and this is actually gaming related.

02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:06.320
So...

02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:07.320
Not from Sorting Glue?

02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:09.120
No, not from Sorting Glue.

02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:10.120
World of Warcraft.

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:14.040
No, I'm not giving you, my FU, to World of Warcraft, but I am a little bit.

02:37:14.040 --> 02:37:19.200
You might have heard this week, they put some new items on sale, and you can get a new $10

02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:22.440
pet called Little XT, which is one of the raid bosses later in the game.

02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:23.440
Whatever.

02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:24.440
They've done the pet thing before.

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:31.520
But one of the other things they decided to sell was a Celestial Horse mount for $25.

02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:39.120
That's right, 25 real life dollars would buy you this mount in game that, you know, granted

02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:47.320
it has its own statistics or whatever, that you can, the mount scales with you, you know,

02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:50.440
whatever your riding level happens to be in the game is what the mount will be, and so

02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:51.680
on and so on.

02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:57.200
But it's $25, and it doesn't really enhance anything.

02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:00.560
You're not getting anything special that you can't, like, earn, you know, through other

02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:02.060
means or what have you.

02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:05.040
It's really just the ultimate vanity item.

02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:09.200
And I have to admit, there was a part of me that was like, oh, that's kind of cool.

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:11.160
I kind of want to get one of those.

02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:14.400
But then I was like, but really, $25?

02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:20.000
That's like almost like half of what the new expansion is going to cost for WoW.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.960
Cataclysm's going to cost that much money.

02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:26.400
Well, sure enough, all these stories start popping up.

02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:33.620
The queues on Blizzard's store just to buy My Little Magical Star Pony was like four

02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:36.360
hours long, 17,000 people deep.

02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:39.360
You would have thought BlizzCon tickets went on sale again.

02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:44.160
And I log into the, all I had to do to convince myself I don't want a magical star pony was

02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:47.700
to log into the game and go to Dalaran.

02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:51.040
Everybody has a magical star pony.

02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:57.760
Blizzard this week cooked up free money for their game, literally free money.

02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:01.600
It's a test because you have to understand Blizzard is owned by Activision.

02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:07.360
Activision loves money and Activision likes putting out map packs for $15.

02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:10.000
Mark my words.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.280
Mark my words.

02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:17.720
When Blizzard puts out the item, I'm whatever they want to do vanity and people are whatever

02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:19.000
enough to buy it, then whatever.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:20.000
And you know what?

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:21.000
I'm not perfect.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:22.000
I bought the panda thing when it came out.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.940
I kind of regret doing so after the fact, but I don't because it was charity.

02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:28.360
So I'm like, okay, at least in the end it was charity.

02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:31.920
But after I bought it, I have to admit, I did have a little bit of buyer's remorse of,

02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:33.340
you know, that was kind of stupid.

02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:34.640
Everybody has one of these pandas.

02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:37.120
I don't, I don't, I'm not actually going to use it that much in game.

02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:42.000
This was a stupid vanity thing, but at least it was charity.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:46.040
But never again am I making that mistake, but mark my words, the minute Blizzard releases

02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:51.680
something that does enhance your stats or does give you an enhancement or especially

02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:55.360
something you can't get through the game through other means, I quit period.

02:39:55.360 --> 02:39:59.560
I'm done with wow, when that happens, because as far as I'm concerned at that point, wow

02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:04.080
has become Farmville at that point.

02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:07.080
Tell me the difference between wow and Farmville when that happens.

02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:09.080
Facebook integration.

02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:10.920
No wow has that now too.

02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:14.600
You can't play wow on Facebook, but there is an official wow application.

02:40:14.600 --> 02:40:20.160
So as soon as that happens, which I'm afraid is now after seeing how well this pony is

02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:24.360
done and exactly what Loki says is in the not too distant future, I quit.

02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:31.120
I'm done with wow because it is, it's kind of insane in some ways that Blizzard probably

02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:37.000
sold easy, a half million of these Blizzard made a million dollars.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:38.000
No more than that.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:41.160
Blizzard probably made $10 million this week, right?

02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:43.360
25 times half a million would be about what?

02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:44.360
12.5 million, right?

02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:46.200
What will you play?

02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:47.200
I don't know.

02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:48.200
Something else.

02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:49.200
Please Star Trek Online with me.

02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:50.200
Final Fantasy 14 for one.

02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:51.200
But we'll see.

02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:52.860
I don't know if Star Trek Online does the same thing.

02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:55.540
And no MMO am I going to do that with.

02:40:55.540 --> 02:40:59.440
What Star Trek Online does, I'll tell you, and I actually like this with the Cryptic

02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:00.440
store.

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:04.920
You buy points and you've got them for whatever you want them for.

02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:11.880
What I bought was, um, I actually bought the ability to play a Klingon on the Federation

02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:16.200
side, play a Ferengi because they've each got their own bonuses, their own special abilities

02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:19.880
because this might be something that I want and I'm kind of a weird completionist.

02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:22.040
But I liked that.

02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:27.120
I liked that you could pay, you know, you could pay to, um, to respect.

02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:31.800
If you've completely through barred everything, you could pay to respect and, and it's, it's

02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:33.440
not even a lot of points.

02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:38.760
I've only spent $20 in buying points and I still have some left and I've gotten all this

02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:39.760
stuff.

02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:40.760
They make it affordable.

02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:41.760
So.

02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:42.760
All right.

02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:46.040
I gotta, I gotta give some comments in chat because there's way too good comments here

02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:47.040
in chat.

02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:52.400
Uh, so I should pop says everyone has one, so whatever little originality your tune had

02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:53.440
just got lessened.

02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:54.440
That's true.

02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:55.680
Uh, Chad 28 says cough.

02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:00.240
I bought it cough, but I'm super addicted in amount or do you have, my question is though,

02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:03.520
do you have buyer's remorse now that you see that everyone has, I like the design of it

02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:04.520
though.

02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:06.040
I will have to say that it's a pretty Mount.

02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:07.160
I will say that.

02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:10.040
But when I saw everybody had one, I was like, okay, whatever.

02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:11.800
I would rather work and get that.

02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:14.300
The Raven Mount is so fucking Epic.

02:42:14.300 --> 02:42:15.300
It's the best Mount in the game.

02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:19.520
Did you, but it's a bitch, but I'm saying that this is though, no, I said, did you see

02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:22.920
the link in the chat where they made $2 million in four hours?

02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:25.200
God, I'm not surprised.

02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:29.440
I do have to though, give them props for actually having a very unique design.

02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:31.920
I mean, I haven't seen anything done like this.

02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:35.280
Legend is that who makes an excellent point and you thought paying for horse armor was

02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:36.480
bad enough.

02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:48.480
If you had a problem with horse armor in Oblivion and you bought this, um, um, uh, just saying,

02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:52.360
let's see, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, let's see, I'm looking

02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:53.360
at here.

02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:56.840
Um, other chat rooms, chat, that orange laundry.com.

02:42:56.840 --> 02:43:03.660
If you want to look, uh, let's see, as 200, Matt says, NHL 10 started letting you download

02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:07.480
additional stats to your creative player for blank XBL space bucks.

02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:11.540
You can unlock those bonus stats in game, but they were a real pain in the ass to obtain.

02:43:11.540 --> 02:43:13.680
So a lot of people just bought the stats.

02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:16.320
You know, gyromancer has something like that too, but I don't know.

02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:19.520
I somewhat give gyromancer a pass because it's not a multiplayer game really.

02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:22.640
I mean, I guess it does have a multiplayer mode, but it's, it's more of a single like

02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:23.640
player puzzle game.

02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:24.640
I don't know.

02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:25.640
It just seems different.

02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:28.360
And by the way, horse armor does actually make sense if your horse is part of your battle

02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:29.360
stat.

02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:33.240
Chad, Chad 28 says, there's also a rumor going around that they're going to charge 20 bucks

02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:34.720
a month when cataclysm comes out.

02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:35.720
Even I will leave.

02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:39.480
If that happens, a shower ran and chat says, it doesn't matter if Rob's done with wow.

02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:40.960
He'll be sucking MMO cock again.

02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:42.960
The second final fantasy 14 comes again.

02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:43.960
That's true.

02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:44.960
True statement.

02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:47.200
Um, and Ziba gave a look at that link earlier.

02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:48.200
So there you go.

02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:49.200
Rama says, sky.

02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:50.200
I'm going to hold you to that.

02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:51.200
Go for it.

02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:54.640
Um, there you go.

02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:56.640
Lots of chat comments, chat, that orange on trader.com.

02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:58.540
If you want to join him anyhow, sorry.

02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:01.800
That was actually my a few of the week that kind of turned into a story of its own, but

02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:03.440
that happens here on the show.

02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:06.000
Sometimes we have a couple more actual stories for you guys, and then we're going to get

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.160
into, um, the calls of the week, one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype,

02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:12.160
orange laundry.

02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:13.160
Oh, just one minute though.

02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:14.160
Don't start calling yet.

02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:15.160
Cause we've got a couple more stories.

02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:16.160
Loki.

02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:21.720
Um, apparently the 3d games, um, are going to be coming to the PlayStation network very

02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:22.720
soon.

02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:30.700
Um, of course you probably seen commercials and stuff for 3d TVs, um, on TV, um, including

02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:36.960
some from Samsung will Sony's going to be releasing their new, um, Bravia 3d TV series.

02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:42.480
And uh, with that will be a voucher for a, uh, kind of a free collection of games that

02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:49.000
are going to be, uh, compiled onto a, um, it'll either be a PlayStation network code

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.320
or a compiled onto a disc.

02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:57.680
And they include a wipeout HD, uh, Microsoft or not Microsoft, motor storm.

02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:04.640
I saw the Ms, uh, motor storm, Pacific rift, pain, um, super stardust HD.

02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:08.800
And um, I guess those will all be available on the places you never get at the same time.

02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:15.000
Now granted though, these aren't all 3d, it's kind of like portions of like wipeout HD is

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.780
actually supposed to be in full 3d motor storm Pacific rift is supposed to have a level that's

02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:26.720
in 3d pain has, I believe three levels and not positive about super stardust HD, but

02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:33.280
it's kind of like a, I don't know, a little, uh, proof of concept games, I guess.

02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:36.360
Toa gak in our chat room says 3d is overkill out the wazoo.

02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:37.760
You know, I kind of agree.

02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:38.760
I don't know.

02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:39.760
I don't know.

02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:44.680
Then again, maybe if I play it, I'll change my mind, but I already kind of said this earlier

02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:45.680
in the show.

02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:49.440
I just, I don't know how I feel about everything shifting towards 3d quite rapidly.

02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:53.680
Might I add like, it's not just happening like slowly, it's happening fast.

02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:56.120
It feels like 3d is taking over fast.

02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:57.120
Thank you.

02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:58.120
Avatar.

02:45:58.120 --> 02:45:59.120
Me.

02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:04.320
Just saying, by the way, do you know avatars out on a Blu Ray?

02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:05.320
What?

02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:06.320
The 22nd?

02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:07.320
It's a week.

02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:08.320
But what?

02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:09.320
Yeah.

02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:10.960
It's just the movie with none of the goodies.

02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:11.960
You wait till November.

02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:12.960
Hmm.

02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:13.960
Interesting.

02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:15.560
Do you get the Blu Ray that comes with all of the goodies?

02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:16.680
Huh?

02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:19.320
This is more like, okay, here's your bone.

02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:24.280
Well, I, I love the fact that they're marketing it with go back to the world.

02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:26.760
Like they're not even trying to say, Hey, you should see this movie.

02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:28.160
They're just making an assumption.

02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:30.560
Everybody's already seen it, which is pretty much true.

02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:32.760
And then of course there's going to be chatters to say, I haven't seen it.

02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:33.760
I haven't seen it.

02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:34.760
Most people at this point have seen it.

02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:38.360
And then, um, they actually were re-releasing it for the weekend.

02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:39.360
Really?

02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:47.280
Um, at certain theaters for the 3d blah, blah, whatever poop.

02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:50.560
So are you going to pick up avatar on a, or you're going to wait, aren't you?

02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:51.560
I'm going to wait.

02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:52.560
Yeah.

02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:53.560
I want the extra stuff.

02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:54.560
I don't care.

02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:55.560
I'll wait.

02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:57.440
I've got avatar.

02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:59.200
I mean, I, I like the movie.

02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:01.640
I thought it was great.

02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:03.920
I see what you did there.

02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:04.920
All right.

02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:08.800
Um, let's get into one more story here and then we're going to open up the Skype line

02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:14.920
and uh, Oh, this is a very fitting last story of the day here on orange lounge radio.

02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:20.840
Where do I even go with this?

02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:28.560
So there's this woman and she's from Manchester and she's talking we fit this week.

02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:32.440
And the reason why she's talking we fit, she's blaming it because it turned her into a sex

02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:33.440
addict.

02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:34.440
Yes.

02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:37.640
We fit made me a sex addict on the next Oprah.

02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:39.240
It's this 24 year old.

02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:40.240
Her name is Amanda flowers.

02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:41.240
Doesn't that sound?

02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:44.600
I have to say, honestly, it doesn't like, is this for real?

02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:48.560
Cause isn't there a porn star named Amanda flowers?

02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:49.560
If not, there ought to be.

02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:53.840
It doesn't have like a very, it sounds like a horny name, doesn't it?

02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:54.840
I don't know.

02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:55.840
We'll see.

02:47:55.840 --> 02:47:56.840
D flowered number 50.

02:47:56.840 --> 02:47:57.840
All right.

02:47:57.840 --> 02:47:58.840
Well, anyhow.

02:47:58.840 --> 02:47:59.840
Um, okay.

02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:06.380
So, uh, yeah, she fell off the balance board and she claims that because of the stumble,

02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:08.280
she is now a sex addict.

02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:15.240
She wants sex 10 times a day, the slightest vibration in the air.

02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:19.760
She says it begins as a twinge down below before surging through my body.

02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:22.840
Sometimes it built up into a trembling orgasm with no cure.

02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:25.880
I just have to try to control my passion by breathing deeply.

02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:28.520
Hopefully one day I'll find a super stud who can satisfy me.

02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:30.600
And I'm thinking here, I'm like, is this a fucking joke?

02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:32.600
Like is April, is April fool's still happening?

02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:37.640
Does someone not get the memo that April fools is supposed to be stuck to April 1st but it's,

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:38.840
it's all over the net this week.

02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:43.760
So I guess we have to treat it like I don't watch a lot of TV remember, but I watched

02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:51.160
an episode of CSI I think it was at my friend's house where like this teacher had ended up

02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:55.960
like doing it with one of the students because she had been in an accident that messed up

02:48:55.960 --> 02:49:00.440
her brain that made her addicted to sex.

02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:05.280
I was like, and I just listening to this like just makes me think of that episode.

02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:09.000
I'm like, did she hit her head?

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:10.840
Is she just, did she fall on her cooch or something?

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:12.760
No, there is actually, it's a real...

02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:14.360
Did she hit herself in the labia?

02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:15.360
I mean what...

02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:16.360
It's a real syndrome.

02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:19.360
It's a persistent sexual arousal syndrome.

02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:21.120
From falling off the wee balance board?

02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:22.120
I mean, I guess whatever...

02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:26.120
I hate to bring back up that episode, but it was a head trauma that did it for the episode.

02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:27.120
I don't know.

02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:29.240
How did they pick like things that are kind of far fetched?

02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:30.240
Hmm.

02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:33.280
Uh, let's see here.

02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:34.280
Are you on the Wiki?

02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:40.200
No, I'm on the Boston University School of Medicine's, um, sexual medicine.

02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:44.240
I think they're a sub, uh, page here.

02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:51.400
Uh, let's see, uh, it doesn't really say what the causes are.

02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:57.040
Um, it's, okay, whatever.

02:49:57.040 --> 02:49:58.400
So it's, it's a real thing.

02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:01.000
I mean...

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:02.240
Head trauma and sex drive.

02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:07.340
I'm immediately going to go home and fall off my Wii Fit board as many times as possible.

02:50:07.340 --> 02:50:11.180
Head trauma and sex drive are connected since a person suffering from brain injury usually

02:50:11.180 --> 02:50:12.880
has a reduced sex drive.

02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:15.080
Um, yeah, whatever.

02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:18.680
Frisbee says in chat, if hitting your head makes you a sex addict, how is this Nintendo's

02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:19.680
fault?

02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:22.680
You know, part of me wants to say this story really has nothing to do with Wii Fit.

02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:23.680
Wait a second.

02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:24.680
You know what this reminds me of?

02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:26.720
And oh my God, I can't believe I'm thinking about this.

02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:28.600
Don't worry, mama will fix it.

02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:34.840
What was that one movie that had, um, oh my God, the guy that did Hairspray, but...

02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:35.840
John Waters.

02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:36.840
John Waters.

02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:40.040
John Waters movie where everyone was like a sexual deviant or whatever.

02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:44.100
Desperate living and they go, they get exiled to the town of Mortville.

02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:45.100
It's really disgusting.

02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:46.760
Like it's the most disgusting movie ever made.

02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:47.760
Is that what it is?

02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:52.040
Um, I don't think it was that one, but she, like they were trying to figure out a new

02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:53.800
sex act or whatever.

02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:57.080
Oh, oh, uh, uh, you're, it's a newer one.

02:50:57.080 --> 02:51:00.280
It's um, uh, damn it.

02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:01.480
It's the one, I know what you're talking about.

02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:07.480
They had that one girl and she had ginormous tits and Tracy Ullman was in it, um, I know

02:51:07.480 --> 02:51:08.480
what you're talking about.

02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:13.520
It'll come a desperate, no, desperate living already said somebody in chat will get, thank

02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:14.520
you.

02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:15.520
Low down, dirty shame.

02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:16.520
Yes.

02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:17.520
Low down, dirty shame.

02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:18.520
It's like dirty.

02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:19.520
No, it's not.

02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:20.520
Low down, dirty shame was another movie.

02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:21.520
Dirty shame is the name of it.

02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:22.520
It's dirty shame.

02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:23.520
Anyways.

02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:28.760
Um, it's like that because that was their kind of sex act is she would, um, cause some

02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:34.240
sort of head trauma and then she became like a sexy deviant.

02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:36.620
So yeah, that's right.

02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:38.200
That was the whole point of that movie, huh?

02:51:38.200 --> 02:51:41.280
Tracy Ullman gets in a car accident and then like suddenly she's a sex addict.

02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:42.280
Dirty shame.

02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:43.280
Wow.

02:51:43.280 --> 02:51:51.280
Well, I guess it's a dirty shame she fell off her Wii Fit board, huh?

02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:54.360
Like I said, I'm going to go home and probably try to fall off my, uh, uh, board as many

02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:56.360
times as possible.

02:51:56.360 --> 02:51:58.840
All right.

02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:03.760
Skype line is now open one eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype, orange

02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:04.760
lounge radio.

02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:09.420
The phones are open for business while we wait for some calls.

02:52:09.420 --> 02:52:10.720
Last minute stories.

02:52:10.720 --> 02:52:11.720
Anyone?

02:52:11.720 --> 02:52:14.660
Gunblade is coming to the Wii.

02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:18.280
They're going to do Gunblade New York and LA, um, machine guns packed together kind

02:52:18.280 --> 02:52:22.520
of like what they did with, um, house of the dead two and three.

02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:27.960
That makes me happy because I used to play the crap out of Gunblade accuser.

02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:28.960
I don't remember.

02:52:28.960 --> 02:52:29.960
Gunblade.

02:52:29.960 --> 02:52:33.200
They have like these giant machine guns that you would shoot stuff with and they would

02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:35.600
just constantly rumble as you're playing the game.

02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:36.600
All right.

02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:37.600
To the phones.

02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:38.760
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:52:38.760 --> 02:52:39.760
Who's this?

02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:40.760
Hi.

02:52:40.760 --> 02:52:41.760
Yeah.

02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:42.760
This is spazzing you.

02:52:42.760 --> 02:52:43.760
Hey spazzing here.

02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:44.760
What is on your mind?

02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:45.760
My friend.

02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:46.760
All right.

02:52:46.760 --> 02:52:47.760
Yeah.

02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:49.760
Uh, you know, you know, two, uh, two things.

02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:54.960
Um, uh, before I get to that, I just want to say I, you know, with the life story you

02:52:54.960 --> 02:53:02.400
read off, I can just see every guy in America going out to store right now by we fit for

02:53:02.400 --> 02:53:03.400
the girlfriend.

02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:04.400
Actually.

02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:05.400
Yeah.

02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:06.920
I was going to say, I thought you, I thought you were going to say guys are going to run

02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:07.920
out and buy it.

02:53:07.920 --> 02:53:12.440
Uh, actually most, and I, obviously I was joking earlier when I was talking about, I'm

02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:16.320
going to go fall off the thing, but I think most guys already are sex addicts.

02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:19.080
It's just that they're going to like, they're going to get this game for their, you know,

02:53:19.080 --> 02:53:20.560
girlfriends or wives and so forth.

02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:26.400
And then like, you know, spray Pam all over the Wii fit board or they don't even have

02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:27.400
to do that.

02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:31.440
I mean, obviously it's just some hard surface or something and I want to know how she fell

02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:32.920
off the Wii fit board.

02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:33.920
I mean.

02:53:33.920 --> 02:53:34.920
All right.

02:53:34.920 --> 02:53:35.920
Anyhow.

02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:36.920
I'm sorry.

02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:37.920
Spaz.

02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:39.720
That's probably not why you were calling it tonight, but what's up?

02:53:39.720 --> 02:53:40.720
All right.

02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:41.720
Yeah.

02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:48.840
Um, you know, you know, I was wondering if you, uh, checked out, um, you know, uh, flowers,

02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:54.920
the soundtrack yet or no, uh, no, I, I think I do remember reading a story that it was

02:53:54.920 --> 02:53:58.280
available, but flower had a great like ambient soundtrack.

02:53:58.280 --> 02:54:02.560
Like that would be like, remember how we had the story earlier tonight about the, um, study

02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:06.640
about modern warfare two versus, uh, March of the penguins and which won't make you fall

02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:07.640
asleep.

02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:10.480
Uh, the flower soundtrack will be a great thing to fall asleep to.

02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:11.840
It's very nice.

02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:12.840
Ambient music.

02:54:12.840 --> 02:54:13.840
Is that available to get now?

02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:14.840
Oh yeah.

02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:15.840
Yeah.

02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:19.600
Uh, in fact, it's been out for roughly a week and a half now.

02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:27.120
Uh, in fact, uh, just this past, uh, Friday, I ended up picking up, uh, just for the hell

02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:28.120
of it.

02:54:28.120 --> 02:54:29.120
And it's, uh, pretty good.

02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:30.120
Yeah.

02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:35.320
In fact, I, if you were kind of touching on there, uh, yeah, I, you know, ever since I

02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:41.840
got it, I've been using it to, uh, fall asleep to whenever I, I get a bad case of insomnia.

02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:46.200
So which is pretty much on a regular basis.

02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:49.280
Flower by the way, is one of the best racing games I've played in the past year.

02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:50.280
Yes.

02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:51.280
I consider it a racing game.

02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:52.280
It plays like a racing game to me.

02:54:52.280 --> 02:54:53.280
Play it for yourself.

02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:54.280
Find out.

02:54:54.280 --> 02:54:55.280
But I think it's a great support.

02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:56.280
Oh my gosh.

02:54:56.280 --> 02:54:57.280
It's a beautiful game.

02:54:57.280 --> 02:54:58.280
It's just such a beautiful game.

02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:03.280
You know, there was some, um, uh, controversy, I guess Ebert spoke up again about another

02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:05.680
whole games as art controversy came up again.

02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:07.880
He said, games are not art and they're never going to be art.

02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:12.680
And it's funny because like every blog story I see reporting on the news issue has got

02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:14.620
a picture of flower to go with it.

02:55:14.620 --> 02:55:16.280
It's kind of like the, Oh, games can't be art.

02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:18.880
A so I wonder if there'll be a flower too.

02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:19.880
We'll see.

02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:20.880
Yeah.

02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:27.720
Well, we'll probably get a flower or something, uh, you know, far too or something silly to

02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:28.720
print.

02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:29.720
No, pretty.

02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:35.880
She thinks, uh, all of these have been doing well, flower flows, so on and so forth.

02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:43.240
Um, no, you know, also, um, you know, it's very, my usual day, I usually do, um, every

02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:49.360
so often, uh, there's a one show, you know, uh, uh, discovered that, um, I think you guys

02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:55.080
made more, uh, like, especially, um, one of the fellow, the fellow working with DJ Ramel

02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:56.080
out.

02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:57.080
Hmm.

02:55:57.080 --> 02:55:58.080
What's that?

02:55:58.080 --> 02:55:59.080
Uh, it's called, uh, Toko.

02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:08.600
It's, um, it's a talk episode, uh, anime series, uh, that, uh, that's been out on cable TV

02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:15.280
and it's also available on, uh, Xbox live and, uh, PlayStation network.

02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:18.400
It's, uh, it's kind of hard to describe.

02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:24.040
It's kind of like, um, a cross between the X files and devil may cry.

02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:25.040
Interesting.

02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:26.040
Yeah.

02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:27.040
Yeah.

02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:34.760
Yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh, well, I've seen, uh, the first four episodes so far and based

02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:40.440
on, you know, it's really kind of the same, uh, you know, what the whole fuse is like,

02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:45.200
but just, uh, based on what level I've seen so far, it seems pretty good.

02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:52.920
Um, you know, there are, there are a few race here moments in there that weren't necessarily

02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:58.600
great for the younger crowd, but, uh, but if you're holding off to handle that kind

02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:00.320
of thing, you know, it's pretty good.

02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:01.960
For us mature folks who can handle it.

02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:04.920
All right, well, Spaz- Spazinator, we'll have to check that out, but for now I'm gonna let

02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:08.400
you go, but thanks for the chat and, uh, lots of different topics tonight and you have a

02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:09.400
good week, okay?

02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:10.400
Yep, you too.

02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:11.400
Take care.

02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:12.400
All right, later.

02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:17.920
Uh, by the way, a comment from our chat room from, uh, Seg, uh, he wants to point out that.game.company,

02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:21.680
the people who make Flower, they don't do sequels, but they don't fail to make something

02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:22.680
new and beautiful.

02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:23.680
And you know what?

02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:24.680
I'm, I'm totally okay with that.

02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:25.680
You know what?

02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:29.960
Flower doesn't need a sequel, um, necessarily, but, uh, it would be awesome if there was

02:57:29.960 --> 02:57:36.040
another game kind of in that same vein, just that very relaxing, beautiful art in motion

02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:37.040
type of game.

02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:38.040
I don't know.

02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:39.040
Whatever it is they make.

02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:40.040
I hope it's next.

02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:41.040
Um, I'm sure it will be pretty cool.

02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:43.040
Anyhow, uh, let's go to the phones.

02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:44.040
Hi, you're on Orange Town's radio.

02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:45.040
Who's this?

02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:47.760
You know, all this talk about sex makes me want to just sit here and play a couple of

02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:48.760
age games.

02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:51.760
Well, hello, DJ Rama S. How are you?

02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:53.480
Hey, I'm fine.

02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:57.040
Uh, Spaznator was talking about a show he was recommending, Toko.

02:57:57.040 --> 02:57:59.040
Have you heard of that?

02:57:59.040 --> 02:58:00.040
No, I have not.

02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:01.440
Hmm, you might have to ask him about it.

02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:05.040
He specifically said it was for you, so, uh, and us, but he said you might get a kick out

02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:06.040
of it.

02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:07.040
Oh, okay.

02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:08.040
Yeah, check it, check it out.

02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:09.040
You never know.

02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:11.880
Well, I'm already working a couple of anime titles right now, but that's not what I call

02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:12.880
it though.

02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:13.880
All right.

02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:14.880
Well, what's up?

02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:15.880
All right.

02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:16.880
Why did you call?

02:58:16.880 --> 02:58:17.880
Surely you didn't call to talk about Wii Fit.

02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:18.880
What's on your mind?

02:58:18.880 --> 02:58:24.920
Do you remember a couple of years ago, you guys talked about a Spanish DDR movie called

02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:26.920
La Maquina de Bahia?

02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:31.020
Yes, sadly enough, I do remember that.

02:58:31.020 --> 02:58:33.840
Me and my friend Jerry watched it Friday night.

02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:34.840
Really?

02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:35.840
Yes.

02:58:35.840 --> 02:58:39.880
Okay, so it's a Spanish movie about Dan Stan's revolution basically, right?

02:58:39.880 --> 02:58:40.880
Not really.

02:58:40.880 --> 02:58:46.860
It's the campiest feel-good movie of the year, really.

02:58:46.860 --> 02:58:49.320
Of the two years ago, because the movie's been out a while.

02:58:49.320 --> 02:58:50.320
Just seeing.

02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:51.320
Pretty much.

02:58:51.320 --> 02:58:52.320
All right.

02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:57.200
I have to ask, A, what possessed you to, of all things, watch La Maquina de Bahia or whatever

02:58:57.200 --> 02:58:58.520
it's called?

02:58:58.520 --> 02:59:03.600
It was sitting on my computer for about a year and a half, and my roommate was playing

02:59:03.600 --> 02:59:09.880
FF13, and getting him off the 360 is like getting the jaws of life, so I'm like, you

02:59:09.880 --> 02:59:10.880
know what?

02:59:10.880 --> 02:59:14.400
We might as well just watch the movie, and it was like, wow.

02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:15.400
And?

02:59:15.400 --> 02:59:16.400
Was it good?

02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:17.400
It was pretty good.

02:59:17.400 --> 02:59:18.720
I thought it was funny.

02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:26.000
The part of the movie is about this kid who was playing DDR, works in a supermarket.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:30.680
His boss asks him to watch his pet snake, so he's like, yeah, sure.

02:59:30.680 --> 02:59:37.000
His friends find out that he has this place on his shelf, they bring chicks over, and

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.160
they find out that the snake has disappeared.

02:59:39.160 --> 02:59:44.820
They run up to the back, they find the snake ate a propane gas tank.

02:59:44.820 --> 02:59:49.120
When they try to pick up the snake, they drop the snake to the ground, they're like four

02:59:49.120 --> 02:59:51.720
flags up, and the snake is destroyed.

02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:54.280
The fuck does this have to do with DDR?

02:59:54.280 --> 03:00:01.640
They end up entering a tournament to win the cash money to replace the snake.

03:00:01.640 --> 03:00:03.200
Wow.

03:00:03.200 --> 03:00:06.360
The funny part is...

03:00:06.360 --> 03:00:08.920
So it's kind of like the wizard, right?

03:00:08.920 --> 03:00:12.320
Weren't they entering the tournament to graze money to run away from home?

03:00:12.320 --> 03:00:13.320
What were they doing?

03:00:13.320 --> 03:00:14.320
I don't remember.

03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:16.320
They were waiting for something, and he entered the tournament.

03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:17.320
Mm-hmm.

03:00:17.320 --> 03:00:18.320
Right?

03:00:18.320 --> 03:00:19.320
Yes.

03:00:19.320 --> 03:00:21.040
I see.

03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:25.880
So it was basically the wizard in Spanish, but with less Power Glove and more snakes.

03:00:25.880 --> 03:00:27.760
And a lot more butterfly.

03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:29.760
Goody, goody.

03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:36.160
All right, so thumbs up or thumbs down to, let me make sure I get this right, La Magina

03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:37.160
de Bailar.

03:00:37.160 --> 03:00:38.160
Bailar.

03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:39.160
That's how it is.

03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:40.160
Bailar.

03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:42.160
Yes, I'd give it two thumbs up.

03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:43.160
Bailarvos.

03:00:43.160 --> 03:00:44.160
Bailar.

03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:45.160
Bailarvos.

03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:46.160
Bailarvos.

03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:47.160
Sorry.

03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:49.640
I give it two thumbs up with alcohol.

03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:55.840
It's funny, so it's hilarious, drunk, because for some reason, I'm watching a movie.

03:00:55.840 --> 03:00:59.280
I had this tendency to point out indifference.

03:00:59.280 --> 03:01:01.960
In the movie, I'm pointing out, this is from DDR USA.

03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:03.680
This is from Extreme 2.

03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:04.680
This is from Max.

03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:06.000
I'm like, look at the different screens.

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.200
I'm like, this is from this one, this is that one.

03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:09.200
And we're...

03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:10.200
Ramah.

03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:11.200
Ramah.

03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:12.200
Sorry.

03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:13.200
It's because you're a nerd.

03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:15.260
You're a fucking nerd.

03:01:15.260 --> 03:01:17.800
And I love you for it, but you're a nerd.

03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:22.520
I mean, you're not supposed to do that with nerd movies.

03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:24.800
It's called the suspension of belief.

03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:31.440
Well, me because it was so campy, my eyes started looking at all the other stuff, you

03:01:31.440 --> 03:01:32.440
know?

03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:33.440
Mm-hmm.

03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:35.520
A true DDR nerd till you die.

03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:37.200
I can respect that.

03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:38.520
All right.

03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:43.600
Anything else you wanna talk about tonight that isn't about DDR and snakes?

03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:47.480
Before I hang up, I want this herd.

03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:49.720
I'm holding you to that.

03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:50.720
What?

03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:51.720
About wow.

03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:52.720
About wow.

03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:53.720
Yeah.

03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:54.720
Okay, but I wanna make it clear.

03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:56.280
I wanna make it very, very clear.

03:01:56.280 --> 03:01:57.280
Go for it.

03:01:57.280 --> 03:02:04.400
They need to put something out for sale that is basically a way to cheat.

03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:10.640
I should say that the item sale would give somebody a clear advantage just by spending

03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:11.640
money for it.

03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:14.060
Because obviously, you can already pay for faction transfers.

03:02:14.060 --> 03:02:15.280
You can pay for server transfers.

03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:16.280
That's fine and dandy.

03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:17.280
I don't have a problem with that.

03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:18.640
I don't have a problem with vanity items.

03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:25.800
I'm gonna have a problem when the item that you spend hours and hours to grind and get

03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:30.500
and raid for that gives you the bonus stats to intellect or whatever is suddenly available

03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:33.040
for $15 through Blizzard's website.

03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:34.520
That is where I draw the line.

03:02:34.520 --> 03:02:35.520
Okay.

03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:36.520
Alright.

03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:39.260
I just wanna make it very clear because I know how the listeners are and every single

03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:44.120
item that comes out, they're gonna say, oh, does Rob have to delete wow now?

03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:47.320
That's why I wanted you to say it so everyone's all clear about it.

03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:50.440
I don't care how many magical star ponies they put out.

03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:51.440
And you know what?

03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:55.200
If they put out a pink pony, I might have to do it.

03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:56.200
I'm kidding.

03:02:56.200 --> 03:02:57.200
I'm not gonna do it.

03:02:57.200 --> 03:02:58.200
Well.

03:02:58.200 --> 03:02:59.200
It depends on the price.

03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:00.200
If it's $5, maybe.

03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:03.040
But $25, that's the other problem.

03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:06.680
There's a big difference between 10 and $25.

03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:11.860
Like $25 is like the price of a used game.

03:03:11.860 --> 03:03:14.720
This just proves that people are sheep.

03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:16.080
And I have friends that bought it.

03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:19.800
And I feel bad saying this, you know, and even a friend, a really good friend wanted

03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:20.800
to gift it to me.

03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:24.320
And I'm like, no, please don't you don't you re no, really?

03:03:24.320 --> 03:03:26.980
You really, really don't have to do that.

03:03:26.980 --> 03:03:33.200
Like I would like, go buy yourself a bottle of vodka and a porno and have yourself a wonderful

03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:34.200
evening.

03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:38.600
Like I would rather you do that than buy me the star pony.

03:03:38.600 --> 03:03:44.000
All right, anyhow, Rama, we gotta let you go try to get some more calls.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:45.000
But thank you so much.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:46.000
No problem.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:47.000
Bye.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
Bye bye.

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:50.800
As Anakdev points out, yes, it is a big difference.

03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:52.600
It sure is a big difference.

03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:54.240
I hate this Skype spam.

03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:56.360
Look at this.

03:03:56.360 --> 03:04:01.680
European wait, this guy, this Skype spam I got European and American women are too arrogant

03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:02.680
for you.

03:04:02.680 --> 03:04:04.720
Well, I know of one.

03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:10.520
Are you are you looking for a sweet lady that will be caring and understanding then you

03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:11.520
came to the right place.

03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:12.880
I didn't come to you, bitch.

03:04:12.880 --> 03:04:15.120
You're sending me a spam message.

03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:16.120
Let's see here.

03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:19.280
You can find a Russian lady that will love you with all of her heart.

03:04:19.280 --> 03:04:20.720
Can't find a queen to rule your heart.

03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:21.720
How about beautiful Russian?

03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:27.480
I'm going to tell you right now, well, not all Russian women are sweet.

03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:31.960
I want to point out Loki married a Russian woman, not the kind that's being advertised

03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:32.960
here.

03:04:32.960 --> 03:04:33.960
Just so you know.

03:04:33.960 --> 03:04:34.960
No, no.

03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:35.960
Big difference.

03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:36.960
Big difference.

03:04:36.960 --> 03:04:43.360
Nelly's an independent woman, but one more call.

03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:44.680
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:45.680
Who's this?

03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:48.800
One and only Legend of Zaku Zaku.

03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:51.240
What is on your mind, my friend?

03:04:51.240 --> 03:04:52.240
Nothing much.

03:04:52.240 --> 03:04:57.320
Just like trying to spend whatever freedom I have tonight before going back, before the

03:04:57.320 --> 03:04:59.360
case of the Mondays kicks in tomorrow.

03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:01.680
Wait, but you're working.

03:05:01.680 --> 03:05:02.680
That's good because I remember-

03:05:02.680 --> 03:05:03.680
I know.

03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:04.680
That's the important thing.

03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:05.680
Yeah, of course.

03:05:05.680 --> 03:05:06.680
Yeah.

03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:07.680
Yeah.

03:05:07.680 --> 03:05:08.680
I remember a time you were calling into the show and you were like, I'm unemployed.

03:05:08.680 --> 03:05:11.720
I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to do this, but then you found a job,

03:05:11.720 --> 03:05:12.720
so all's better.

03:05:12.720 --> 03:05:13.720
Well, I know how you are.

03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:17.680
We all get a case of the Mondays, you know, no matter what, you know, it happens, it happens.

03:05:17.680 --> 03:05:22.380
Even the people that are job hunting kind of go, oh God, I hope this is the week.

03:05:22.380 --> 03:05:23.380
You know?

03:05:23.380 --> 03:05:24.380
I know how it goes.

03:05:24.380 --> 03:05:25.380
Right.

03:05:25.380 --> 03:05:26.380
So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

03:05:26.380 --> 03:05:28.380
Activision's bullshit.

03:05:28.380 --> 03:05:30.560
That's what's on my mind tonight.

03:05:30.560 --> 03:05:33.480
Is it the star pony bullshit or is it Infinity War bullshit?

03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:39.400
No, it's basically their executive trying to do their best to put lipstick on a pig

03:05:39.400 --> 03:05:42.780
regarding the whole Infinity War situation.

03:05:42.780 --> 03:05:48.240
In particular, how he's defending that they get compensated better in Activision.

03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:49.240
Hold on, hold on.

03:05:49.240 --> 03:05:54.720
I'm sorry, when you said lipstick on a pig, I immediately went to that whole Sarah Palin

03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:55.720
thing.

03:05:55.720 --> 03:05:56.720
No.

03:05:56.720 --> 03:05:58.360
The whole Infinity War issue.

03:05:58.360 --> 03:06:02.040
I just, I don't know why, my mind just went to Sarah Palin.

03:06:02.040 --> 03:06:04.880
I'm not trying to, I'm not calling her an idiom, I'm just saying she said something

03:06:04.880 --> 03:06:06.440
about lipstick on a pit bull.

03:06:06.440 --> 03:06:08.520
That's where my mind went.

03:06:08.520 --> 03:06:14.120
The idea is that Activision's trying to whitewash something, you know, basically their years

03:06:14.120 --> 03:06:19.840
of trying to milk the proverbial golden calf that was Infinity Ward.

03:06:19.840 --> 03:06:25.240
When you milk somebody to the point of, to the point of, you know, where you saturate

03:06:25.240 --> 03:06:29.480
the market and everything else, because that's all it is, it's mediocrity, it's a race

03:06:29.480 --> 03:06:32.320
to the bottom, unfortunately.

03:06:32.320 --> 03:06:38.720
And in this case, Activision tries, they basically try to, you know, they're running a slave

03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:44.360
ship in terms of, you know, not only Infinity Ward, but other studios that have to churn

03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:48.200
out a new Call of Duty game every single year.

03:06:48.200 --> 03:06:49.680
Quality be damned.

03:06:49.680 --> 03:06:54.460
Well, at the same time though, Activision, their point in life or whatever is to make

03:06:54.460 --> 03:06:55.460
money.

03:06:55.460 --> 03:06:59.080
And there's investors that are expecting, hold on, investors expecting them to make

03:06:59.080 --> 03:07:02.520
money and return on investment, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah, blah.

03:07:02.520 --> 03:07:06.880
So, you know, and all these people are quitting left and right in, I believe Activision is

03:07:06.880 --> 03:07:11.120
based in California, which would be an at-will employment state, or wherever they are, obviously

03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:14.080
they're not signed to contracts because they are quitting left and right.

03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:18.120
What else can Activision do but come out and say, well, don't worry, everything's going

03:07:18.120 --> 03:07:22.320
to be okay, even though they might be pooping their pants behind the scenes because they

03:07:22.320 --> 03:07:24.880
have investors to make happy at the end of the day and they're going to say, of course

03:07:24.880 --> 03:07:26.080
this will be a great game.

03:07:26.080 --> 03:07:30.240
No, these people are just going to be better off where they're at and we're much better

03:07:30.240 --> 03:07:31.240
because of it.

03:07:31.240 --> 03:07:33.920
And then behind the curtain, they're like, oh, my God, what are we going to do?

03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:34.920
All right.

03:07:34.920 --> 03:07:39.000
One thing is basically having to meet the demands of their investors.

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:42.800
As a public company, they have to, but that's only short term.

03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:49.520
What they should be focusing on is long-term returns, basically long-term return on investment,

03:07:49.520 --> 03:07:54.960
which is really hard to do because you need to be more original in terms of finding new

03:07:54.960 --> 03:08:01.480
ideas that would stretch out even further, making other multi-million dollar franchises,

03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:04.040
not just milking the current ones you have.

03:08:04.040 --> 03:08:09.600
This is the problem with not only the business world in particular, but Activision and the

03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:10.600
fact that they're so short-sighted.

03:08:10.600 --> 03:08:17.920
EA basically woke up from that nightmare a few years back and actually started making

03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:21.680
more original properties, more original games.

03:08:21.680 --> 03:08:26.560
And as a result, they're still a publicly traded company, but they have a lot more in

03:08:26.560 --> 03:08:31.000
the portfolio in terms of actually, you know, the franchises.

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:35.000
And they don't basically milk them every, they don't have to meet the 10-month deadline

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.760
for new games.

03:08:37.760 --> 03:08:40.080
So maybe this will just come full circle, Zaku.

03:08:40.080 --> 03:08:41.640
I mean, you said it yourself.

03:08:41.640 --> 03:08:47.160
Yeah, I'm thinking Activision has to eventually reach a point where their mediocrity is going

03:08:47.160 --> 03:08:48.740
to bite them in the ass.

03:08:48.740 --> 03:08:49.740
And that's a fact.

03:08:49.740 --> 03:08:50.740
That day is coming.

03:08:50.740 --> 03:08:57.960
The day will come when people just realize that they're getting raped, they're getting

03:08:57.960 --> 03:09:02.880
hoodwinked every single year with the same bullshit, with the same game that offers very

03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:06.640
little in terms of fresh, you know, new content.

03:09:06.640 --> 03:09:10.600
I am really curious to see what happens this year, Zaku, you know, being the music game

03:09:10.600 --> 03:09:11.600
fan.

03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:12.600
And I know you're in this boat too.

03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:17.340
I'm very curious to see what happens at the end of the year with Guitar Hero 6 or whatever

03:09:17.340 --> 03:09:22.720
they end up putting out, because you know it's going to happen, versus Rock Band 3.

03:09:22.720 --> 03:09:25.640
Because especially when you take into light this whole lawsuit and all this other business

03:09:25.640 --> 03:09:30.720
going on right now, I'm very curious to see how the, and I guess it's come out, the Guitar

03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:33.820
Hero 5 and Band Hero and all that didn't sell too hot.

03:09:33.820 --> 03:09:34.820
Of course.

03:09:34.820 --> 03:09:41.240
So I'm really curious to see if Rock Band kicks it down or what happens.

03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:45.200
I mean, the reason, you have to give it to Harmonix, that they actually took something

03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:49.680
that has never been marketed that well, like the Beatles catalog.

03:09:49.680 --> 03:09:52.360
And they actually made a boatload of money as a result.

03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:56.640
I know it was a license, but still, that was a major license right there.

03:09:56.640 --> 03:09:59.640
Here's the first thing that they've done right so far this year.

03:09:59.640 --> 03:10:05.440
It's been almost four months now, and we haven't had a guitar release yet this year, so.

03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:06.440
I mean that's something.

03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:07.440
Well that makes sense.

03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:12.920
I mean, that and the fact that, you know, Harmonix is not like trying to claw their

03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:16.280
way to get another Rock Band version out next year.

03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:21.880
It's been almost what, like what, almost more than a year since we had Rock Band 2.

03:10:21.880 --> 03:10:26.160
And all they're doing is just shoveling new content, which is good because that's, it's

03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:31.800
better to, you know, keep people, have people continue buying the current version and then

03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:36.720
just focusing on delivering more DLC, because that's really where they're, that's really

03:10:36.720 --> 03:10:41.080
the heart of the game, the music.

03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:42.080
All right.

03:10:42.080 --> 03:10:47.320
Uh, ZakuBuddy, we're gonna let you go, but some good thoughts on that, and we'll see

03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:48.320
what happens.

03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:49.320
It's gonna be very, I think you're right.

03:10:49.320 --> 03:10:53.760
I think the cycle will come full circle, and somebody else will be the big bad evil dude

03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:54.760
next year.

03:10:54.760 --> 03:10:59.960
At least the folks from Infinity War broke out when they had the chance, and so now that

03:10:59.960 --> 03:11:05.600
they're back in TGA, at least this time, they're not gonna get screwed over and be whipped

03:11:05.600 --> 03:11:12.440
to, to chunk out, you know, to turn out Call of Duty games or any new IP that they have

03:11:12.440 --> 03:11:13.440
every annual.

03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:14.440
All right.

03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:16.440
Well, we will see what happens.

03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:20.160
All right, Zaku, we're gonna let you go, buddy, but you have a good one.

03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:21.160
Have a good one.

03:11:21.160 --> 03:11:22.160
Later.

03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:23.160
All right.

03:11:23.160 --> 03:11:25.520
I think that's gonna do it for the Skype calls tonight, and somebody in chat making a very

03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:26.520
good point.

03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:29.080
Did you notice that like every New York listener got in tonight?

03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:30.960
Isn't that weird?

03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:35.120
Like I guess technically, technically Spaznator is in New York City, but he's in Buffalo,

03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:39.480
which is still upstate New York, so, so tonight was a very New York state of mind in many

03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:40.480
ways.

03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:43.920
So, I don't know what you New Yorkers are doing with your phones, but y'all got it.

03:11:43.920 --> 03:11:45.160
Even SSJ100Matt, we called him.

03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:46.160
He's in New York too.

03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:47.160
Go figure.

03:11:47.160 --> 03:11:48.920
I think they just really want me to come visit.

03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:50.120
That's what you want, right?

03:11:50.120 --> 03:11:51.400
I really want to go back to New York.

03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:52.400
I really do.

03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:53.400
We'll see.

03:11:53.400 --> 03:11:54.400
Hopefully soon.

03:11:54.400 --> 03:11:55.520
My friend doesn't live there anymore, so I have to go.

03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:59.920
I'll have to crash at Rama's house.

03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:00.920
See if he likes that.

03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:01.920
All right.

03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:07.080
So, we are going to start to wrap up here, because it's about 9.30 here on the west coast.

03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:09.320
It's been kind of a long show tonight, at least three hours if not more.

03:12:09.320 --> 03:12:13.940
So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight and be on our way out of here for the night.

03:12:13.940 --> 03:12:16.920
So let's go around and make sure there's no more last-minute stories.

03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:18.680
I don't know if Loki has anything else he wants to state.

03:12:18.680 --> 03:12:21.800
Oh yeah, I got lots of stuff we can talk about.

03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:27.480
Okay, first thing we're going to start off with here is, there's a possibility that there

03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:30.600
might be a new Castlevania game coming, apparently because...

03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:31.600
Another, another game?

03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:32.600
Uh, yes.

03:12:32.600 --> 03:12:35.360
This is going to be more for like a DS title or something like that.

03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:36.360
Three DS?

03:12:36.360 --> 03:12:38.520
Well, who knows.

03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:44.220
Apparently there was a trademark registered by Konami Digital Entertainment for something

03:12:44.220 --> 03:12:46.680
with the title of Harmony of Despair.

03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:50.000
And if that doesn't sound like a Castlevania title, I don't know what it is.

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:53.760
Yeah, it sounds pretty Castlevania to me.

03:12:53.760 --> 03:12:58.240
Apparently Jam with the Band on the DS is coming to Europe.

03:12:58.240 --> 03:13:00.640
That game was originally only released in...

03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:03.760
Didn't that come out like two years ago?

03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:04.760
In Japan, yeah.

03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:05.760
Oh, wow.

03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:06.760
Okay.

03:13:06.760 --> 03:13:10.760
Yeah, it's never been released over here or in Europe, so they're going to be getting

03:13:10.760 --> 03:13:11.760
that.

03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:15.160
And with a bunch of new songs, I guess.

03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:26.020
A bunch of covers like ABC, Chariots of Fighter, I'm a Slave For You, Material Girl, among

03:13:26.020 --> 03:13:27.020
other things.

03:13:27.020 --> 03:13:33.160
And, of course, some Nintendo original songs including an F-Zero Medley, NES Classics Medley,

03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:40.600
Legend of Zelda Medley, Super Mario Kart Medley, Super Mario Medley, and Onigashima Medley.

03:13:40.600 --> 03:13:45.600
I gotta be honest, a lot of this sounds pretty good.

03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:48.040
And let's see here.

03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:54.520
Nintendo has actually won an appeal against Anascape in their suit saying that they had

03:13:54.520 --> 03:14:03.240
a patent for, I guess, the Wave Bird and the classic controllers and whatnot.

03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:04.920
So that's kind of cool.

03:14:04.920 --> 03:14:08.960
Unfortunately, they have been sued again by somebody else.

03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:19.280
Now, IA Labs apparently is going to be suing them because of a fitness game, Power Grid

03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:20.280
Fitness.

03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:28.240
They're saying that it infringes on their patent for it.

03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:33.640
And apparently they said that they also approached Nintendo with the idea in the first place.

03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:36.240
That would be interesting.

03:14:36.240 --> 03:14:41.800
And lastly, there's going to be some new Xbox Live arcade games coming soon.

03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:48.680
Apparently, there's information leaking out from PartnerNet, which I shake my head at

03:14:48.680 --> 03:14:49.680
that.

03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:58.200
So, Crazy Taxi will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade, as well as Quake Arena Arcade and

03:14:58.200 --> 03:14:59.720
some other...

03:14:59.720 --> 03:15:00.720
What?

03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:01.720
Quake Arena Arcade?

03:15:01.720 --> 03:15:02.720
Yes.

03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:03.720
Rad.

03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:05.200
That was already announced, I think, a while ago.

03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:06.200
On Xbox?

03:15:06.200 --> 03:15:10.880
Yeah, it's going to have 16 player online battles with 40 original maps.

03:15:10.880 --> 03:15:14.640
Get your trash talker ready, Matt.

03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:18.920
Some other titles, of course, on the way that apparently are appearing on PartnerNet as

03:15:18.920 --> 03:15:19.920
well.

03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:28.000
Metal Slug XX, Neo Geo Battle Colosseum, Raystorm HD, Sonic Adventure DX, The King of Fighters

03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:37.240
2002 Unlimited Match, Quake Arena Arcade, Crazy Taxi, Bali, Card Game, and Doom II,

03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:38.240
the arcade version.

03:15:38.240 --> 03:15:41.440
Doom II arcade version?

03:15:41.440 --> 03:15:45.520
And the first five of those titles, if you know where they'll look, have already been

03:15:45.520 --> 03:15:47.520
leaked out.

03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:55.080
All right, very cool.

03:15:55.080 --> 03:15:56.280
Lots of good stuff in there.

03:15:56.280 --> 03:15:58.360
That's it for last minute stories then, Loki?

03:15:58.360 --> 03:15:59.360
That's it.

03:15:59.360 --> 03:16:00.360
We've had a really full show tonight.

03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:01.360
It's been kind of impressive.

03:16:01.360 --> 03:16:02.360
I'm really out of stuff too.

03:16:02.360 --> 03:16:03.360
All right.

03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:04.360
That's why I'm sitting on the floor again.

03:16:04.360 --> 03:16:05.360
I know why.

03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:06.360
I noticed you're working on your decoupage.

03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:07.360
I am.

03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:08.360
So I figured you had to be out of things.

03:16:08.360 --> 03:16:09.360
Well, you know...

03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:10.360
Are you going to take a status picture for our chatters to see?

03:16:10.360 --> 03:16:12.080
I am once I actually have something worth the status.

03:16:12.080 --> 03:16:15.960
I'm actually gluing, doing extra layers of glue on the back to hold down these loose

03:16:15.960 --> 03:16:16.960
ends.

03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:21.240
Um, I'll tell you, I'm actually, there's X-Box stuff I'm excited about coming out.

03:16:21.240 --> 03:16:22.240
What's that?

03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:23.240
Well, I want to play them.

03:16:23.240 --> 03:16:24.240
We're heroes.

03:16:24.240 --> 03:16:25.240
Ah, very nice.

03:16:25.240 --> 03:16:28.280
I see your decoupage pictures are already up on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

03:16:28.280 --> 03:16:29.280
Very nice.

03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:30.280
Very nice.

03:16:30.280 --> 03:16:32.720
They've replaced the pictures of Matt with the double down last week, which is good because

03:16:32.720 --> 03:16:33.720
I was taking a look at that thing.

03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:35.800
Or me with the nose pond.

03:16:35.800 --> 03:16:37.560
Yeah, you with the nose pond.

03:16:37.560 --> 03:16:40.880
That was really bad, but funny from that episode.

03:16:40.880 --> 03:16:42.800
Oh, that was the week Loki missed.

03:16:42.800 --> 03:16:43.800
Oh boy.

03:16:43.800 --> 03:16:46.560
You should be very glad you had family things to tend to that night.

03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:47.560
What happened?

03:16:47.560 --> 03:16:53.840
Uh, Dark Sakura had this thing in her nose that she used for her sinus things and it

03:16:53.840 --> 03:16:56.000
looked like she was shoving a tampon in her nose.

03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:01.480
And so we were calling it a nose pond and I dared her to take a picture and put it on

03:17:01.480 --> 03:17:02.720
the website and she did it.

03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:03.760
I looked crazy.

03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:06.920
You know that Jamie doesn't like pictures of her.

03:17:06.920 --> 03:17:09.480
Like she's very picky choosy about what she lets out on the internet.

03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:15.080
She's like, I'll take one cause I know I look shitty today.

03:17:15.080 --> 03:17:16.080
Good times.

03:17:16.080 --> 03:17:17.080
Okay.

03:17:17.080 --> 03:17:18.080
We got to go around and get some final thoughts.

03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:19.080
We got to close up shop.

03:17:19.080 --> 03:17:22.720
We're running very late tonight and I know some folks want to go to bed before you know

03:17:22.720 --> 03:17:23.720
the sun rises.

03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:26.320
So I will start with Dark Sakura cause you're on the floor.

03:17:26.320 --> 03:17:28.800
Uh, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

03:17:28.800 --> 03:17:31.240
I like glue.

03:17:31.240 --> 03:17:32.880
Loki your final thought for our listeners tonight.

03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:35.560
Why is Rama coming to Sacramento and going to kidnap Rama?

03:17:35.560 --> 03:17:36.560
Uh oh.

03:17:36.560 --> 03:17:37.560
Uh, he's coming.

03:17:37.560 --> 03:17:38.720
He's coming to stay with me.

03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:39.720
When is he coming?

03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:40.720
I need to make sure I'm available.

03:17:40.720 --> 03:17:41.720
For explosions.

03:17:41.720 --> 03:17:42.720
Is Patty coming too?

03:17:42.720 --> 03:17:43.720
Oh, 4th of July.

03:17:43.720 --> 03:17:44.720
Right?

03:17:44.720 --> 03:17:45.720
Yes.

03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:46.720
That's what we should rename it.

03:17:46.720 --> 03:17:50.000
You know, are they going to be here for pride the week before?

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:53.160
Oh, guys need to rearrange schedule and get here the week before.

03:17:53.160 --> 03:17:54.160
That's pride.

03:17:54.160 --> 03:17:57.080
Rob, you need to, you need to take me cause I haven't been to a function yet.

03:17:57.080 --> 03:17:58.080
It'll be fun.

03:17:58.080 --> 03:18:00.120
All I've been is to the street fair.

03:18:00.120 --> 03:18:01.480
It's on my birthday this year though.

03:18:01.480 --> 03:18:02.480
So I don't know how I feel about that.

03:18:02.480 --> 03:18:03.480
I'll have to get you dinner.

03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:04.480
We'll see.

03:18:04.480 --> 03:18:05.480
All right.

03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:06.480
Anyhow, we're done.

03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:07.480
We're out.

03:18:07.480 --> 03:18:08.480
Uh, my final thought is, um, I don't know.

03:18:08.480 --> 03:18:12.960
Um, I just ate a whole bag of cinnamon sugar pita chips during the show cause I'm fat hot.

03:18:12.960 --> 03:18:13.960
All right.

03:18:13.960 --> 03:18:14.960
Uh, that's it.

03:18:14.960 --> 03:18:15.960
Thank you guys for being here.

03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:19.000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show, downloading, listening live, however

03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.600

Just help us spread the word.

03:18:29.720 --> 03:18:31.240
You know, we don't have ads in the show yet.

03:18:31.240 --> 03:18:32.800
I always say yeah, cause you never know.

03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:36.440
We might want to someday, but if we haven't for eight years, I mean, shit, who's going

03:18:36.440 --> 03:18:38.440
to buy the ads based on the show.

03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:42.560
And uh, you know, we, we, we certainly don't ask for any money from you and we're not going

03:18:42.560 --> 03:18:44.600
to ask for any money from you to do this show or what have you.

03:18:44.600 --> 03:18:46.360
So all we ask, just help spread the word.

03:18:46.360 --> 03:18:47.360
That's all we want.

03:18:47.360 --> 03:18:50.280
Uh, thank you guys so much for downloading and uh, wasting your Sunday evening with us.

03:18:50.280 --> 03:18:51.440
We really appreciate it.

03:18:51.440 --> 03:18:52.440
Have a wonderful week.

03:18:52.440 --> 03:18:54.200
We'll be back to do it all again next week.

03:18:54.200 --> 03:18:56.160
Yes, we'll be here next week.

03:18:56.160 --> 03:18:59.800
Um, next week I've got Conan O'Brien live on Friday, so I know I'll definitely talk

03:18:59.800 --> 03:19:02.880
about that even though that really has nothing to do with games, but I've done a few weeks

03:19:02.880 --> 03:19:03.880
low key.

03:19:03.880 --> 03:19:07.360
Low key wanted me to talk about that, so I will, um, what else is going on next week?

03:19:07.360 --> 03:19:09.560
I got Rocky and, and it'll be lots of games.

03:19:09.560 --> 03:19:15.240
I'm sure lots more, a magic sword, a double impact and a also world of Warcraft because

03:19:15.240 --> 03:19:17.480
my characters have lots of games to play.

03:19:17.480 --> 03:19:19.520
Just hit Northrend, my new set of characters.

03:19:19.520 --> 03:19:20.960
So lots of fun stuff.

03:19:20.960 --> 03:19:22.320
All right, we're out.

03:19:22.320 --> 03:19:23.320
Have a great week.

03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:24.320
We'll see you next week.

03:19:24.320 --> 03:19:25.320
We'll do it all again next Sunday.

03:19:25.320 --> 03:19:26.320
Sound good?

03:19:26.320 --> 03:19:27.320
Good.

03:19:27.320 --> 03:19:28.320
Have a great week.

03:19:28.320 --> 03:19:30.320
