00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and the Low Crew

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight at the 25th of 2010, could a new TV station come to an Xbox near you?

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Some big Wii titles get delayed, and a Capcom press event confirms all that was spoiled last week

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
Hello my friends all across the internet and welcome to another episode, episode 364 of Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
It's the video game program where every gamer has a voice

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
Pull up a chair and join us and chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening

00:50.000 --> 00:58.000
April the 25th of 2010, right after Bobby Blackwolf has finished his show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Say hello as well to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Grapes

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
How are you doing?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Grapes

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Full of grapes?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Muscat grapes

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Did they taste grape?

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, we got three hours full of puns for you guys, I bet you can't wait

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
I heard worse over the weekend

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Alright, and Loki, Techmaster Loki's in the house

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yes I am

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
How are you doing?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm doing okay

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
Now, Techmaster Loki, brought to the show with him tonight from KFC, Double Down number 2

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Yes, this time without the horrible cheese sauce

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And it still had kind of that little taste of the cheese sauce on there but

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
It was alright, it was definitely edible this time

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
And I just have to say it's kind of just average, really for the cost you're better off getting pretty much anything else

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
Even stuff from KFC, because I mean Double Down's like a good, I think $6.99 or something

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I mean, hell, you can get a lot more chicken for that

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Just get a chicken wing

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Or just get wings

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Just get a chicken wing

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Just keep it old school

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Barbeque wings or something like that, that's really where it's at, it's good stuff

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Don't need the rest of the Double Down, it's just really just an excuse to sell expensive chicken

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
That's all it really is

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
But yeah, tried it with extra bacon even

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And just, it's kind of okay

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Even extra bacon didn't make it better?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Didn't really make it that, didn't make a difference really

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Because it was just too much of the white meat chicken flavor

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Alright, going to our chat room at chat.orangelandre.com

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
You know we call them the always present fourth guest on the show

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Because we don't have any special guests tonight

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
We haven't had a lot of special guests at Studio Dark Soccer, I don't know what it is

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
The people I invented to were outside in the front yard racing RC cars

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Or they were

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Is that what they're really doing?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Yes

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
That's funny

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
And chasing

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I only saw the girls across the street in the Barbie car

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
That I almost ran over

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
That was while, when you were just here and sitting here wondering what to do

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yes

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
They were outside actually chasing the dog with the RC cars

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Will's dog won too

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
I see

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
And just to bring some light to what Dark Soccer said while you were sitting here wondering what to do

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Usually I get to the show about an hour early, right?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I get here to the show because you know I want to set everything up

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Get the mixing board, the mics, the chairs, the computer

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Make sure we're ready for Bobby's call because he actually calls us about 5.45, 5.50

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
You know make sure everything's good to go

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
So that we're ready for showtime

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
But tonight I arrived and Dark Soccer had been proactive tonight

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
She had already set up the mixing board, plugged it in, had the mics

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Everything was ready to go, I just had to turn on the computer

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Except for Loki's mic because you forgot

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Well that was my fault but that's neither here nor there

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
And I had gifts

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Yes and she even gave me, what is this, like sweet beer or something, soda beer

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Shandy, it's a Shandy Bass

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Dark Soccer's trying to get me drunk

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
It's beer soda

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I don't know why she's trying to get me drunk

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
It's a little too sweet overall but it's really good because it tastes just like

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
It's basically like a lemon soda with a little bit of beer in it

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Alright, I know we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
But there's some actually really funny personal things I think we have to talk about

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
And Dark Soccer, this cracked me up

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Something that you have recently added to YouTube

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Give us some background on what's going on here and what happened this past week

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Well, I went to my friend Becky's son's third birthday party

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Well okay, first of all, first of all that morning I went to a bar mitzvah

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I hadn't eaten anything so I won't even go into that

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
So I went to Becky's son's birthday party

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
And he was really cute and he was wearing like the best shirt ever

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Which was a t-shirt with a Dalek on it

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
So I actually managed to get some commentary from him

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
And I love this YouTube more than anything

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
What?

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
The first thing it got cut off is I asked him what was on his shirt

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh okay, so, hey kid, what is on your shirt?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Dalek

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
What does a Dalek say?

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
It's a serendipity

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
And my immediate reaction was, Dark Soccer, what are you teaching the children?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I didn't teach him that

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
It wasn't me, I didn't do it

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
It was either his mother or his aunt or some relative along that vein

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
And if you want the chat room shouting link, link

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
But I want to give this out so that everybody has it

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It's just on Dark Soccer's personal YouTube which you've given up

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Dark Soccer O-L-R

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Yeah, just YouTube, what, YouTube.com slash user slash Dark Soccer O-L-R

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
One word

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
So there you go, exterminate

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Play it again, play it again, play it again

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
One more time, one more time

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
Exterminate

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It's not as scary when he says it

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
It's really not

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I also like how you said Dalek

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Alright

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Dalek

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
I hope you had fun, that's going to be the next David goes to the dentist video right there

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Exterminate

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Alright we have breaking

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
Becky, because I'm chatting with Becky, she said that he watched Doctor Who with them and seen a Dalek episode

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I see

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
So he knows what a Dalek is

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
Alright, well we got some other breaking news, live unfolding, breaking news here at the O-L-R studio headquarters

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
We go live over to Tech Master Loki with the special report here

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
What is going on, this is unfolding live actually, literally

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
One minute before we went live tonight, we've found something out, what is going on, Loki?

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Apparently one of Jamie's friends messaged me on Facebook

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
By the name TJ McKimy

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
And posted a link to a Stockton Craigslist entry

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Guess whose number happens up here, right there

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Oh, the guy that stole my 360 a while back

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Off loady, PS3 now

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
And your money

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Yes, and my money

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
So the guy who hack soared your 360 for real and just ran off with it and never

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
And if you didn't hear the show about a month ago, long story short, you went out to meet the guy

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
And he was going to do the J-Tag thing on your 360 so you could play as Baluta and all that stuff and no more heroes and stuff, right?

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
So he was going to do that to your 360 and he said, you know, come back in a couple hours

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
Which should have been your hint right there, Loki, but you know, you don't know until it happens

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
And so Loki tried to go back and yeah, the guy ran off with his 360

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
And that's why a super nice listener in Austin, we suspect, based on where the package came from

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Apparently sent Loki a new one

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
So you think we'd be over this by now, but thanks to Super Sleuth TJ on Facebook

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Apparently this guy is at it again on Craigslist

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh yeah

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I think I want to nail him

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
I know, and the chatters are going, call him, call him live on air

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
I am not radio professionally

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I think there's an issue with doing that when you don't have the person's permission

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
I realize he's the bad guy, but I worry it would turn into one of those things where the thief falls through the roof

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
And then sues the owners of the home for the fact that he broke his foot trying to break into the house

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
You know what I mean?

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
So I can't do anything about it

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
But

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
As we look to the person who can do something about it

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Or, well, I'm just saying

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
I don't want to drive down the Stockton again, I mean, it's Stockton, it's just, it's awful

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
You have, you have, we, hey, we don't write the news, we just report it

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I say just call Stockton PD and

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
It would be funny, but, I mean, what are they going to do?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
They're going to be like, well, it's our word versus yours

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Uh, yeah, I was trying to illegally hack my 360

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Well, not even, it doesn't even matter if that was the case

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
I was having solder work done on my, you know, 360s motherboard

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Alright, and Bobby in chat, you know, because he knows more about radio than I do

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
So that's a, it depends on the states guy

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Some states only need one side's permission

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
You know, again, it's just one of those things where it's like, you know what, it's

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
What about calling Disneyland?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I don't think it would be good

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Remember when they called Disneyland?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
That was harmless, that was funny

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
This will be funny too

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
And then the call got disconnected right in the middle

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Dark Saga is referring to an old ass episode

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
A ten year old episode of Understation Live

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
That was great

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Where we called the pay phone at Disneyland

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
That's how you know it's old

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Because, are there even pay phones at Disneyland anymore?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I know, right

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
We called the pay phone at Disneyland and started having a conversation with some guy

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
And like right in the middle of it, the call just dropped

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
And we're like, oh shit, the Disneyland mafia

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Just like tapped into the conversation and just terminated the call right there

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Exterminate!

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Alright

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
And then, oh apparently now, on top of everything else

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Chatters are saying the stream is down

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
See?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Something is going

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
No, we're back

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I know it's back, I'm looking at the little broadcasty thingy

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
And it says it's still sending data over

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Well we still gotta tape the show

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Because remember, I know live listeners

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
We love you guys, but we love the podcasters too

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
And the podcast people, they don't get the stream downtime

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
So we just gotta keep on rolling

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I don't know what happened there, that's very odd

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Xbox guys hacking our network too

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Alright, let's get around ten minutes into the show finally

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
And we can finally talk about our gaming week

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Stark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
It was not

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Oh yeah, I started playing Babylonian Twins

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Now that I finally have gotten my project out of the way

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
And had a chance to play something

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
It's really fun, oh my god it's really fun

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
But it's definitely, it's like a puzzle adventure game

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
It really is, because like you do one thing with one brother

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
And then the other one is a statue

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
So you actually can use him, when one's a statue

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
You can jump off of him and put him on buttons and levers and things

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
So it's just, it's really, really fun

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
This is the best way I can say it, it's just really fun

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And I've gotten through like the first

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I got through the tutorial level just playing around

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
And now I'm actually doing one of the levels for real

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
You know, like I said, I've really been busy doing a lot of other projects

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
But this is, it's really fun, it's a fun little game

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
And once I play more I'm actually going to do a little write up on it

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Oh my gosh, our website might actually get some content outside of the

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Lovely, and don't get me wrong, I love the I love that song

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
But that's about the only new content our website gets besides show updates

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
So that would be great, I'd love that

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
What?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
New content for the site, it'd be great

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Oh yeah

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
I mean, you know, we have the I love that song, that's it

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
You know, we get it, people love music

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
My brain was still on the game, so I was like, what?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Oh, that, yeah

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
See, I'd already forgotten about it

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
It was okay, just, you know, playing Grand Theft Auto at work

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And that was fun, and then

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
Let's see, this weekend I played through some of Just Cause 2

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Just the beginning, because I have a version of the game

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
That has some of the PC mods on it

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
So that was kind of fun to play around with

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Although, I don't think I ripped it right because

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
A lot of the textures weren't appearing, so it was kind of hard to play

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
But it was fun nonetheless, so I re-ripped it

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
And hopefully it'll work this time

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
And then of course, more Escaluda 2

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
This time I went through the Black Label Novice

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And that was fun

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I'll probably play through the rest of the game later on

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Just kind of go in one version of the game at a time

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
And...

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
What else did I play?

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
I don't think I played in Final Fantasy 13

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
So yeah, I think that's about it, unfortunately

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
I gotta be honest, my gaming week this week was not really that action-packed

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I really didn't play anything but WoW

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I had a very Jamie week this week, actually

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Nothing but Star Trek Online, except for playing Star Trek Online with WoW

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Oh, I did play Star Trek Online last night, sorry

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Oh my bad, well that's just a given

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Well no, I hadn't touched it for a while, but I did play it last night

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
I will say this though, obviously I've been going through personal stuff with the job change

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
It's not a boo-hoo for me, well actually it's a good thing

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
But it just takes away from the gaming schedule

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
I will say this, on the Warcraft front I actually did accomplish quite a bit

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
I actually got one of my new characters, my warrior that I've been leveling with Alan

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
We got those together to Northrend, which is a big event

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
We're in the new content, the Wrath of the Lich King

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
But I will also say this, for the first time finally this week

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I know, I'm a little late, I'm not much of a raider usually

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
I usually run the raids a lot, and WoW I used to about a year ago, but I don't really do it anymore

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
But this week, just randomly got asked to go, I went

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
I ran Icecrown Citadel, the new, well newish, it's not that new anymore for a WoW player

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
But a couple months old raid, that's basically the end game right now

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
The Lich King is the boss of Icecrown Citadel at the very very end

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
I was there for a couple hours, we got to the gunship battle

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I had to go because I had other commitments

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
But we fought the first two bosses, it was cool

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
So I can finally say I've seen the inside of Icecrown Citadel, woo!

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I need to run it again though, because you get reputation just for killing monsters in there

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
You can get cool rings, and stuff

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
So, that was it, I had a pretty Warcraft wonderful week

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
I will try to get back into some of the consoles this week

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I know there's some stuff for Game Room coming out, we'll get to later in the show

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
That I definitely want to get around to

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Although something that somehow missed the show role, so I'll bring it up now

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I heard there were layoffs at Chrome this week

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Apparently the Chrome studio in Australia had some big layoffs

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
And didn't they make Game Room?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
So, are we screwed?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Probably not

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
They have the emulation already set, it's just putting a ROM with an emulator in place

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Probably not even that, just putting a ROM in place

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Well they do other games too though right?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah they do other stuff

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
So maybe this just impacts the other stuff

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Because I was reading it had nothing to do with Game Room

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Even though Game Room kind of met with a reception

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
But that it was more the fact that they didn't get the rights to some Wii game they were going to do

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Based on, I don't remember now

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Somebody in chat will correct me

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
But there was some game they were supposed to do

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I think it was like a movie tie-in or a sequel or something on the Wii

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
That they didn't end up getting to do and that kind of hurt them

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Isn't it always a movie tie-in or sequel on the Wii?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
So

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Alright

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week and for my extra little news story I was throwing in there

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
See I'm starting the news before we even started the news

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Housekeeping tonight, not a lot of show notes

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
I believe we're still here every week for the foreseeable future

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Although I will say our anniversary show is creeping up on us

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
And our anniversary show is going to be the 27th I think of June?

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
I don't know, it'll be the 27th of June

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Will be our what, 8 year anniversary show?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Jeez

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
I know right?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
So that's in about 8 weeks

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And Memorial Day is coming up

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I think we're still all here for Memorial Day

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I don't think, is anyone going out of town for Memorial Day?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
No

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And we still have a show on Memorial Day

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Alright

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
No Fonomy this year again

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I might be going actually

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Are you going to go?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't know, it depends

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I'd like to go and just kind of drop in

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
But we keep forgetting to like, oh yeah we should like try to get a panel

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
But that's got to be set in stone by now so we missed out on that one

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Maybe go just to say hey, we'll see

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Alright um

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Not that many people come and see us at panels anyways

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I've had fun

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
It's always fun

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I don't know

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
More people came out of Fonomy than some of the other places I've gone

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
To do panels

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Well sometimes when you have panels at 7 in the morning

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It's kind of difficult to get a crowd

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Hey that was fun

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
That one kid who showed up had a good time

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
It's like what the hell are we doing here, seriously

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Alright

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Why'd I wake up early for this?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Did you see that I've done a little bit of cleaning in here, a little bit?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
A little bit

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So I've started the

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Your bookshelf looks a lot nicer than it used to

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Massive task

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
It really does

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I've been starting the massive task of organizing this room

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Alright

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I'm putting pictures on the thing

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Ray Ayanami in chat says there aren't any OLR fans at Fonomy anyway

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
There's a few, there's the one guy who every year we're there

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Asked Loki some mat question

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Like why are you such a Mac hater?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
There's some kid every year

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Cause of you

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
That should be your response next year

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Alright

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Because of stupid design decisions

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
Like for example iTunes doesn't work with Windows XP 64 bit

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
For no reason whatsoever other than we want to be douchebag

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Wait, Windows 7 64 bit? Yes it does

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
No, Windows XP 64 bit

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
No it does not

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
No it does not

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Trust me

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I have experience

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
It will not let you install it

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Wait, there's an XP 64 bit?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I didn't even know that

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I know there's Windows 7 64 bit

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That's what I run now

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
But, alright

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
It does not support it for no reason other than Mac is retarded

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Um, yeah you're not a designer so

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Alright, can we please get onto gaming news

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
And not the PC Mac wars again

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Jesus

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I put up the pictures on my bookshelf since it's awesome

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Gaming news, Loki

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Um, there is a rumor

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Coming from Bloomberg

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
That apparently

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
An ex-News Corp president

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Peter Churman

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Was engaged in talks

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Or I guess is currently engaged in talks

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
With Microsoft to possibly launch

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
An Xbox Live television channel

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Now this isn't necessarily gonna be a channel

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That we see on TV

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Focused around the Xbox

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It's actually gonna be something that's gonna appear

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
On Xbox Live

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Apparently

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
During an April 12th meeting

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
At Microsoft's

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Reverend Washington office

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Churman proposed a channel

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Native to the Xbox 360

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
That would feature reruns and original shows

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
For an additional

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
One to two dollars

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Per month on top of the standard

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Xbox Live subscription fee

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
And

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
So it's basically

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Peter is talking to lots of people

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
About lots of ideas in the digital space

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And of course

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Microsoft is not commenting

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
On it but it kind of

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Fits with the rumor

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
That we had last week that apparently

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Conan was in talks

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
With

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Possibly Microsoft for doing his show

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
On Xbox Live

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
It's kind of interesting

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Um

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Who's to say this is off the table?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I don't think it is

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I don't think it is either

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I think this isn't so much a rumor about

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
What would have been

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I think this is a rumor about what's going to come

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I think maybe the fact that Conan

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Didn't go to Xbox maybe

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Slowed it down

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
But not that much

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
You know what I mean? Well it's very risky

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
What were the realistic chances of Conan going to Xbox Live anyway?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
It's very risky

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Being that it's not established yet

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
You don't know what kind of benefits and stuff

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
And if the whole thing flopped

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
It would be a wasted opportunity

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
So it's a more safe

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
More safe bet for him to go to

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
TBS

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
But if

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
If Netflix

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
And all that works on Xbox

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Then why can't

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
This

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I think this would be a good idea

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Just depends on the amount of content

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
That's on here because a lot of people nowadays

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
With cable and satellite bills

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Are higher and higher

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
If this is only going to be

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
The equivalent of possibly $12 to $24

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
A year

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And the content's good

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
A lot of people would probably jump on that

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I know I would if it's got

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Some good shows on there

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
And even just shows that are on normal

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Cable TV or something like that

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I'd be all for that

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Wouldn't that be ironic though

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
If you were getting your

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Television through cable

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
And getting your TV through

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Because your Xbox is actually your cable provider

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Well thanks to the FCC

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
And Comcast

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And stuff like that I'm sure that

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Since now

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
They're trying to

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Not pass the net neutrality

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Those laws and stuff

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
That they'll be able to

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Filter it out

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Oh Comcast, you want to get TV through our cable internet?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
No, I'm sorry

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
That's not going to happen

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I think something's going to happen

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Where that's going to

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
The minute those little loopholes get exposed

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
That stuff's going to get revoked

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Playing quickly

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
But hopefully it's not just wishful thinking

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I'll be really sad

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
But maybe it'll go a long way

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
In trying to get some competitors to Comcast

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Like people will come back to them?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I don't think so

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
As far as the Xbox

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Channel goes though

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I remember last week we kind of had a discussion

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
With the PlayStation tester and all that stuff

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
And you said something like you didn't really want to watch the tester

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Because you thought it was going to be a big commercial for Sony

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Well wouldn't an Xbox network

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Be a big commercial for Microsoft or

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
It all depends on what content's on there

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Here's the thing

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
The tester

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Where the prize is

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Becoming a Sony PlayStation tester

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Come on

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I mean of course it's going to be focusing

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
On a lot of the games that Sony has

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
And people are like, oh my god I'm so excited to play the next

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Big Sony game coming out

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
That's retarded

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
And yes if there was something like that on the Xbox

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
TV channel

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I wouldn't want to watch it either because it would just be a waste of my time

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
It would still be a damn commercial for something

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Now if they had something that was

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Mainstream

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Like something that's on TV for example

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
That might be

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
That's different

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
If they had episodes of The Office or something like that

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Playing on there

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Just whatever

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
You know what I mean?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Well I don't have Netflix

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Oh okay I guess you got me there

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
But Netflix is so cheap

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Is it a dollar a month cheap?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
No not that cheap

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Alright

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
But you'd have to pay for this TV thing too right?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Isn't that what they were talking about?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Yeah like an extra dollar or two a month

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
That's what they're looking to charge

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I guess that's not that bad

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Would I have to pay that Microsoft phony points?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I don't think so, probably not

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
It's interesting if it wouldn't be just

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Cause you know we talk about Xbox, Xbox, Xbox

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
But why wouldn't

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I mean if Microsoft's gonna launch a TV station

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Why wouldn't it be available on your computer?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Why wouldn't it be available on your

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Windows mobile phone?

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Something to compete with the iPhone

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I would think that

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
An Xbox network is not really an

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Xbox network, it's a

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Microsoft network

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Well doesn't

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I mean they have MSNBC

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Maybe streaming stuff from that I don't know

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I think

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
The MSNBC agreement's a little funky

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I think it's a little more NBC than it is

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
MS at this point but I don't know

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I don't know the ins and outs of how all that works

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I guess I should stop trying to sound like an expert

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Move on to another story

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Let's talk about the PlayStation 3

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Since we've had a little bit of Xbox news

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And talk about PlayStation 3

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
And there is some feathers

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Being ruffled on the PlayStation 3 this week

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
And it has to do with the game

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Fight Double Impact or as I call it

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Magic Sword Double Impact

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
You see what's happened

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Is that this game will just

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Not run unless you are signed

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
In online on your PlayStation Network

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Account if you try to load the game

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And you're not signed in you're just gonna

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Get a message that says you need to sign into the PlayStation

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Network well

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
You know I know a lot of people myself

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Included it doesn't really matter because

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
With the PS3s having the wireless

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Internet built in and everything I'm pretty much

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Always connected to PlayStation Network

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
There's very little time I'm

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Not playing the PS3 and I'm not online

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
But

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I mean what if my internet went down

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And I wanted to play

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
A video game which I do a lot

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
When my internet goes down to kind of pass the time

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
You know if I can't play wow I guess I'll go play

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Xbox or PSN

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
So

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I mean this thing is kind of weird

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
This is no better than the Ubisoft thing in my opinion

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
No it's not

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
You have to understand

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Why they're doing it in the first place

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
They're doing it because Sony

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Has this thing and this

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
It's kind of a loophole basically

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
They had a thing where if you download a title

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Say you buy whatever

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
You know a game flower or something like that

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
You can repurchase

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Or redownload flower onto

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Five different systems

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Say your system dies or whatever

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Instead of having to you know

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Change your

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Account so that

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
It's linked to a new system

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Instead of that you have

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Five different chances to download stuff

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Well here's what people are doing

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
They were basically having one person

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Buy it then downloading it for four

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Of their other friends on their other system

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
So basically one person buys the game and five people

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Play it

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
This is a feature that's in

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
The Playstation Network

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
This is something that launched with the PS3

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Capcom apparently

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Wanted to try something because they didn't like

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
The fact that they're losing out on

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
80% of their sales potentially

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
So what they're doing now

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Is they're limiting that to one person

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Now so you have to be the person

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
That bought it in order to play the game

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
So not only are they making you be

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Online they are also

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Limiting the fact that you can't share this

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Or redownload it again

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Unless you're the person that used it

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And if it turns out to be a success

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
This is going to be something that's going on with

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
All their titles going forward

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Well what's also interesting about this

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Capcom actually issued somewhat of an apology

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Later in the week a couple days after this news hit

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Capcom actually

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Sent out a statement

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Capcom would like to formally apologize for the issues

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Consumers are having with the PS3 version of

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Final Five Double Impact

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Typically the notification for a required Playstation

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Network connection appears in the full game

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Description when a game is downloaded from the Playstation

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Store

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Unfortunately when populating this content

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Was overlooked and wasn't included in the

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Versions of the game that released in North America

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
And Asia

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
It was included in the release for Europe

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Capcom should have checked to make sure the notification

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Was included when the final game was made available

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
And we sincerely apologize for this oversight

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
The DRM requirements for Final Five Double Impact

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Are not unique to this release

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
This protection mechanism has been implemented in numerous

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Games offered on the Playstation Store before

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Which ones?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah I don't know

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
When it was brought to our attention and the notification was missing

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
We texted quickly with Sony Computer Entertainment

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
America and a fix is on the way

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Yay they're gonna fix it

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Wait a minute

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
They're not really gonna fix the DRM are they?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
They're just gonna fix the description

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Probably

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
That's the hidden subtext there

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
We would like to thank our vigilant fans for bringing this

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
To our attention and we will exercise better

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Scrutiny on future Capcom releases

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Next time we might use some lube

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Honestly

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Here's the thing

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
It sucks that you have to be online

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
And yeah okay it will suck that you won't be able to play Final Fight

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
If your internet goes out

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Big deal

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Play something else

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I mean seriously

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
That can't be the only game you're playing

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
And finally I mean really the whole reason they're doing this

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Is because people are exploiting a feature

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
In the Playstation 3

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
That's really meant for if your system craps out

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
So you can redownload your content

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Do you really want that to be removed?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Later on you know cause you have people

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Complaining about it and then your console dies

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Oh guess what you gotta download everything again

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Oh I mean you have to rebuy everything again

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Well I mean you're making a good point

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Loki but at the same time

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I just don't like this

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I have nothing to back that up

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I just don't like it

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
But no I'm not the only one

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
And isn't this just inviting

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Cause a lot of this is really reminiscent

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Whatever the reason is for it

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
It really isn't that much different from the Ubisoft DRM

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Please hack me

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Please find a workaround for this

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Please pretty please

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Hackers of America, break me

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
It's the same type of logic

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
That you know you apply to children

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Tell them they can't do something

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
What do they want to do? Do it

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Why don't they just send a fancy wedding invitation

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
On the fancy paper that says you are cordially invited

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
To hack the fuck out of this game

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Cause people can't really

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Hack the Playstation Network right now

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Right now

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
It's cause they took the Linux out

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
But they'll be back

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Okay I'm booting whoever this recruit is

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
In the chat room

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
New rule, you have to have a nickname

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
Well you would have to have one if you want me to read your name

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Cause otherwise there's nothing to read

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
When you guys make a lovely Jack comments

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Why are you booting a recruit?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Jamie's on the warpath tonight

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I'm getting sick of people who just come in and ghost

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And if you want to ghost like make

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I am a ghost for your nickname

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
But otherwise don't just be there

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Maybe they don't have anything to say right now

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
They could be a spy

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
They're not a spy

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
What's going to stop a spy from just saying

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I'm a normal person

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Okay they gave themselves a name

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Right as soon as they gave themselves a name

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
They got kicked

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
See you guys are mean

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Alright chat.orangelsonsready.com

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Some actual comments from chat

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Bochikawa whether or not they want to get more sales

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Still makes a hassle for the regular legitimate user

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
That's going to cost them sales from people not liking the hassle

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
You know Loki not everybody's home is wired to be on the internet all the time

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Then how are you going to download the damn game

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Well not wired to be on the internet the whole time

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
What possible situation would you have

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Other than your internet going out

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
That you would not be on the internet

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
You can't dial up

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
You can't dial up and download

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Maybe not everybody has wireless internet in their house

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
So they actually run a wire when they want to download something

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Then they pull the wire when they're done

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
So they're going to have to run that wire every time they want to play the game

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
All the way in the kid's bedroom or something

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I don't know just

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I don't think Final Fight is a really good kid's game

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
When I say kid it could be a 15, 16 year old where you know

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
If I had a 16 year old I wouldn't care if he was playing Final Fight

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I can think of worse games

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Even if there are training hookers

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I'm sure they have

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
You know a computer

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Download MAME download the ROM done

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Look at that don't even have to be connected to the internet

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
And it doesn't cost you anything

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Frisbee says in what incentive does paying for DRM

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Infective programs give?

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
So I think the subtext I'm reading there is that

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
When you know this is the case you should just not buy it

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Or buy it on our system

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I did buy it on Xbox I had no idea this is the case

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Apparently a lot of people bought it on Xbox

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Because this took a few days to come out

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
The news which maybe says something right there

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I don't know

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Regardless we're going to see the DRM mania

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
Continue for the next few years I'm sure

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
As we get into the next system

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
That sounds like a photoshop to me

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Just take DRM mania and remove the U out of it

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I was thinking the same thing

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
What if the only thing you can find is a percussion freaks machine

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Then you're not looking hard enough

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Dark Soccer what you got for us

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Good news

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Marvel vs Capcom 3

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
They've released the poster art and there's already speculation

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
As to who is going to be in the game

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
So it goes without saying that everything we said last week

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Yeah it happened

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
So of course for the confirmed characters we have

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Morgan

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Chris Redfield

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Wolverine

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Hulk

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Iron Man

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Is Chris Redfield the Jill sandwich guy?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Shirmi's trying to get out

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Yeah from Resident Evil

32:51.000 --> 32:57.000
Him vs the Hulk I'm surprised he hasn't been stepped on and just gone squish

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
The little trailer they put up was pretty freaking cool

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
What did you think of the art style in it?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I liked it

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
It totally made me think of Street Fighter 4

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I've heard some mixed things on it

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Not everybody I've talked to was a fan of the art style in the trailer

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Well they can suck it

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
It's just like Tatsunoko vs Capcom if you ask me

33:15.000 --> 33:21.000
At any rate the speculation on who the other characters are and a lot of these I actually

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
Although I have a few speculations of my own from this

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
They're showing Felicia

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Super Scroll

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Captain America

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Doctor Doom

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Although I'm sort of thinking Taskmaster

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Maybe

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Deadpool of course duh

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Chun Li who cares

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Question mark person

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Oh yay question mark person

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I just happened to be looking

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
And they haven't identified that person yet

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
There's one back there that could be Iron Fist

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Black Widow or someone else

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Dante

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And Frank West

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Fuck yes to Frank West

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Hell yes

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
And looking at some of these others

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
They're actually even speculating

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Some of the

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
They're speculating Trish maybe

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
And a few other kinda

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I would say

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Kinda niche

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Marvel people not really niche

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
It's just you have to really be fans of the books that they're in

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Well if that rumor that came up last week

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Is true that it's gonna have just a

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Mass amount of characters in it

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I think they're gonna have to get a little niche

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Yeah Dormammu

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Is in it well they're saying

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Mephisto got crossed out I think that's funny

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
But yeah

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I don't care I just want it

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
And you're just gonna play Deadpool all day

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
You know just Deadpool all day long

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
He has to talk the whole time though

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
It's not Deadpool if he does not talk

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Your ass off the entire game

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
So they're gonna have to pay his voice actor a lot

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
We'll see what happens

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
And I also want the guy to do the voice actor

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Who does Deadpool in Friends

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Now there was some reaction in our chat room

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
To you going over those names

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
We had Act Deaf yelled out Deadpool

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And then Yland

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Followed that up by saying Be Arthur

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Now I

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I don't remember what capcom game

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Be Arthur was in was there a Golden Girls game

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
No I have to explain this

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Deadpool

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Has or had

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
A major obsession with Be Arthur

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
And who doesn't

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
As in like

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
She was his hot chick ideal

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Who's Be Arthur

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
And I think it's funny how people have paid attention

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
To that cause like in the Deadpool in Friends

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
PSA things that are out

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
In Deadpool's

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Apartment on there he's like don't you wish your girlfriend

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Was hot like bee

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
With a picture of Be Arthur

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I never knew that

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
You know I only you know I don't really read

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Comics that's no secret you know I just

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Don't but I liked the character

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
In the what Iron Man movie

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
When Ryan Reynolds played Deadpool

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
He played Wade

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Well he was funny

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
That's pretty much the type of non stop

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Talking your ear off

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I want to hear except you know more nuts

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Cause he is crazy

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
So sadly

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
They weren't talking about any

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Type of like actual Be Arthur

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Being in the game

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Now they're bringing a Deadpool and of course

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Deadpool has to be followed by Be Arthur and

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Someone hasn't said Chimichangas

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Why wasn't there a Golden Girls

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Video game actually can you imagine

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Like firing up you know Playstation Network

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
You know and hopefully the DRM

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
The cheesecake is a lie

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
That's right and then you know you just turn it on

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
And then

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
The cheesecake is a lie

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
What exactly would you do in the Golden Girls video game

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Eat cheesecake

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
The plan should be a hoe

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Sophia would be angry

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
She'd have her anger snark meter

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
You know what

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I would like to see this as an XNA game

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Like I realize you can't do a Golden Girls

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
XNA game cause copyright IP

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
But there's no reason you couldn't do a

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Senior

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Silver Ladies

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
The Silver Ladies

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
You know adventure game

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Or something

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I always thought it was funny that Estelle Getty played Be Arthur's character's mom

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Yet she was younger

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
That's what they call makeup

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I love Estelle Getty

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I like Be Arthur too I used to watch Mod

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Re-runs of Mod

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I love them both rest in peace

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Betty White hosting Saturday Night Live

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Next week by the way

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Betty White doing a roast

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I saw her

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
It was something else that she was

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Participating in a roast for somebody

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
She is snarky

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I love her

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I'll tell YYR to get right on it

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Please make that happen

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I don't care who does it

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
We need that to happen

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Rama says call it three old biddies

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Actually weren't there four

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
One was the mom so whatever

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
SSG100Matt says wait wait

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Is this an OLR dream game?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
This is a Rob Roberts dream game

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Three biddies in the ho

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I don't think it's just me

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I was listening to

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
The Warcraft outsiders

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
In the car

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
They're another all game show

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Michelle and John I think his name

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I think Michelle's sister was the guest this week

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
And she was talking about that she named her character

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Spornak

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And wow

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
This is my new favorite

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Person that I've ever heard on a podcast

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
She named her character

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
After the Golden Girls and I think Michelle

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Or somebody else popped in and said yeah I named one of my

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I named one of my priests

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Betty Smite

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
And I was like this is

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
That's it my next

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
My next

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Star Trek character

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Is gonna be

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I'm just gonna name her Sophia the old

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
And pick like

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
The old person face and everything

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
And make her super short and Ferengi

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I'm gonna put that on the list of people I want to have

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
On OLR in the future the chick that named her character

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Spornak

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Cause that's awesome you're a true inspiration

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
To us all alright

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Let's move on to other gaming news

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Loki's just sitting here going

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
What is this show tonight?

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I don't know

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Well

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Just like Nintendo to delay some stuff

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Actually just like anybody to delay some stuff

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
But Nintendo

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
In this particular instance has delayed

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Two upcoming games that are very

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Highly anticipated

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Including Sin and Punishment Star Successor

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
And Metroid Other M

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Sin and Punishment has only been pushed back a few weeks

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
From June 7th to June 27th

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
And unfortunately

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Though the

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Metroid Other M game

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Which was originally due on

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
June 27th

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Well that's been pushed all the way to August 31st

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
No that was the day after my birthday and I'm gonna have to wait

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Two more months

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
That gives me enough time to actually hook up

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
My Nintendo Wii again

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I haven't plugged it in since I moved

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Why are these games being delayed Loki?

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
No reason was given

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Other than it's Nintendo just

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Doing Nintendo things

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Do you think that maybe the

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Games aren't finished

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Or they failed some type of quality check or what?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I don't think that they're not finished yet

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I think that they're just

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Spacing out their titles

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
For the rest of the year

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
They had two games coming out in June

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
That really didn't have anything on the plate

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
For the rest of the summer

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
And maybe polishing

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Metroid Other M a little bit more

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Or maybe

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
They're gonna add some gimmicky

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Crap to add onto it

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I hope that god they're not delaying this

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
To add on some like vitality

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Sensor support or some crap like that

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Oh I hope not either

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Well uh

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
At least you'll get the plate at E3 I'm sure

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Yeah I guess that's true

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Alright well all this news

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
About the Nintendo Wii and the delays

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Leads me into a little something

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I want to do on tonight's show

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
We don't do this very often especially on the podcast

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
But we're gonna do a little something called

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Secret Club tonight is what we're gonna do

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Here on the show

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
That's right Secret Club

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
It's a secret to everyone

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Alright

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Here's the deal with Secret Club

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I have a secret and I want to tell you guys

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Cause I can't keep secrets to myself

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
And this is one of those things where somebody said

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Hey Rob I found out this secret and you know I don't really care

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
If you talk about it on your show

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
So of course I've got a big mouth

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
And I'm gonna tell you guys

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
There's actually two kinds of secrets

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Cause you know I do have friends that work with games

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
So if you tell anyone this I'm gonna beat your fucking ass with my shoe

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Those I don't tell anybody

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
But then there's the ones that's like

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Hey Rob I found out this little piece of news

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
And I don't care who you tell

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
So this is a little something secret

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
But you didn't hear it from me

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Cause you know due to things that have happened in the past on this show

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
I don't really want to get

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
You know I don't think

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
OLR really gains anything

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
From you know having broken the news first

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Or what have you

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
But it's a little secret something something

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I didn't hear it here but you heard it

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
The Black Nintendo Wii

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Is coming

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
And it's coming soon

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I have it on good authority from a friend

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
That works for a major

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Store that sells a lot of

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Game hardware and video games

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
That there was some type of

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Alert this week that they're going to be getting

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
A large shipment of Black Nintendo

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Wiis on May

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
23rd is the release date of the

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Black Wii and apparently this actually

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Ties into something we've heard about before because

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
This is the bundle that's also going to include

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
We're not sure and

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
The details were a little sketchy from

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
My source cause he couldn't remember if it was

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
That it was coming with just the

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Wii Motion Plus or if it was

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
The Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Resort It's Wii Sports Resort and Wii Motion Plus

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
But Loki has previously heard of

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
That there was going to be a new bundle that matched

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
What we saw at Walmart before but we're

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Putting two and two together

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
What Loki had probably heard about before is actually going to be this

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Black Nintendo Wii bundle

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
That's right

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
There was no color specifications

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Or anything just basically that they're

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Going to be releasing new bundles soon

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
And that

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
We probably weren't going to get any

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Cause they're dicks

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
And folks from chat

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I haven't heard anything else about the specs

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
No it's not HD, dream on guys

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
It's just a Wii

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
It's the Wii, it's the same damn Wii

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Except here's the difference, instead of

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
White plastic

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
They used black plastic

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
That's it, don't expect

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Anything else, so sorry

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It's not HD

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And it may be an extra free game cause I'm assuming they're also

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Including Wii Sports in there so you get

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Wii Sports and Wii

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Sports Resort, it'd be nice if they added another

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Controller into it

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I doubt it

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I think it's supposed to be the same price

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
It is, it's going to be the exact

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
I must have forgot to say that, it is the exact

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Same price as the Wii you're paying for today

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
So in a way it's a bit of a price drop too

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I wonder what they're going to do with

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I think it actually may be replacing

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
The old Wii SKUs

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
So white Wiis are going to be rare

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
That's right, super rare

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
TigerClaw in chat says a black Wii is a no brainer

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
We sort of had a hint of that recently

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
When we saw a black Wiimote on the most recent trailer

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
For Metroid Other M, well they're already selling black Wiimotes

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Yeah they are

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
And then the folks overseas are saying

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
We've already had the black Wii

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Hey hey hey hey hey

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I'm not controlling the news

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I don't write the news, I just report it

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
The black Wii is not out in the states

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So they're finally getting it

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
May 23rd, and that's what I'm telling you

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Is the date, May 23rd

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Alright

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Yeah it's already been out in other parts of the world

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Don't they have other colors too?

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Like remember E3 years ago there was like a pink Wii

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
And a blue Wii and all this other stuff

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
I don't know

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Let's see Tiger, no I'm sorry

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
SHA100Matt says so wait the black Wii isn't bigger than the white Wii?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Ha ha ha

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Ha ha ha everybody's a jokester here at Orange Laundry

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Ha ha ha

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Going back to something we were talking about a little bit earlier

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
TigerClaw sent me this link in chat

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
And I just have to share this with you guys

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
This link on YouTube that is just pretty fabulous here

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
This is what could be

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
It's an actual, somebody did this on the NES

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It's like a hack or something

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I don't know what

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I don't know what that is

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Some type of like hacked NES cartridge or something

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
So somebody's already started making my dream game

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Alright

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Let's move on to some real games shall we

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
How about Halo? Hey don't tune out

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Halo, I've got Halo updates

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Halo, Halo Reach specifically

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Halo Reach apparently

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Is going to, well you know

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Who knew? Halo Reach

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Is going to have all different types of releases

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
It's not just going to be regular Halo Reach

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
But there's going to be a bunch

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Of other types of Halo Reaches coming out

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
This is a leak from a Best Buy

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Ad apparently

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
60 bucks if you want to just get Halo Reach by itself

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
150 dollars

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
For the legendary edition

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
And there's going to be a limited edition

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Of Halo Reach, it's going to be 80 dollars

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Standard version is just the game itself

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Limited version has a special

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Case, collectibles

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
And in-game armor

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
The 150 dollar option

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Apparently has all of that but also has

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I guess more unique packaging and in-game

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Armor, also a legendary

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Noble 6 sculpture

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I don't know if that's anything like

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
The little Master Chief hat that you could put on

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Your cat for lols

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
You couldn't really put it on your cat just so you know

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
But sounds kind of similar

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Can't you still get

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
That Halo 150 dollar edition

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
For like 60 bucks now discounted at price

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
There's people still sitting on that stuff

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I'm not surprised

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Hopefully this will sell a little better but we'll see

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
What do you think about all this game

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Coming out in three different flavors, Loki?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
They did it with Halo 3

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
And it was kind of fun

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
But hopefully people learned

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
You don't need to spend the money

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
To get a fake helmet

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
At least this has a nice sculpture that comes with it

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I wouldn't pay that though

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Yeah because if you think about it

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
You're basically paying

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Between 80 and 150 you're paying like 70 dollars

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
For the sculpture, you could use that money to get

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Another game if you wanted

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Or you could use it to

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Invest

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
And have 200 dollars

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Next year

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
But there it is

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
I realize there are the fans that will pay

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
That money to have every little thing Halo

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
And who am I to criticize

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
If it was Final Fantasy 14 I'd probably be doing the same thing

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I'd be like 150 dollars that's it

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I'm paying the money right now

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Shh

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Well we've got some word from

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Bimani style about Stride Nasty stuff

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
That's sponsoring it

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
And keep in mind I am completely allergic to it

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
And I don't even like to say the name of it

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
So it's nasty

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
It's Stride Gum

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Nasty

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Save the arcades too

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
But

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Arcade Infinity

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Is actually

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
One of the ones up in the

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Competition for it

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
AI

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Has been like a really big staple

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
In the Bimani community

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
They had all the imports in

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
They also had that weird Gundam game that was so cool

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
And like little Japanese ticket games

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
And Jameralami

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
And it's in LA

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
In case you didn't know

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Well it's in East LA

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
It was born in East LA

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
And also they were selling import cars for a while

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
That's right

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I think the owners were big big big on the import cars

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I think they drove some nice cars

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I actually

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Looked into getting a Skyline from them

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
When I thought I had money

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Nice

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
And that's where Loki did you play some crazy porn game there once

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
That's funny

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
I played a lot of crazy porn games there

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
That's where I first played

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Gals Panic and Dancing Eyes

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
But at any rate

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
The competition is going on

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Until June 15th

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
And they're talking about

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
The

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
AI

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
The owner says that if they win they want to get

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Tycho and Juby

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
But you have to

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Play a game of Calbots 2010

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
And get your final score

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
To the arcade you wish to support

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
And that's at savethearcades.stridegum.com

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Well I mean

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Is Arcade Infinity in danger of closing or something

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I mean haven't they been threatening to close for a little while now

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I don't see anything really about

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
But they're talking about if they won they'd get a Juby

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Machine and all this other stuff

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Or U-Beat or whatever it's called

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I guess

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Weird

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
We're not picking you up

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
I'm talking

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
I'm talking in the mic

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Alright

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Well if you want to support them then there you go

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
You can go play that little game and submit your score

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
But then you have to sign up for spam emails

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
So hopefully you have an actual spam email address

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Or something to send stuff to

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Alright let's go around the world

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
And take a look at some upcoming release dates

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
And games

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
That are coming to a living room near you

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Loki

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Yes lots of stuff coming out this week

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Well not a whole ton

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Start things off with

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Super Street Fighter IV

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
And Xbox 360

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Nier

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
That kind of a beat em up game

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
From Square Enix coming out on PlayStation 3

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
And Xbox 360 this week as well

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Death of the Rights Retribution

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Also on PlayStation 3

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
And Xbox 360

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
You're a fan of

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Sexual Induendo and Boobies

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Record of Argus War

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
The limited edition or the

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
What was it? The naughty

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I forget the

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Some naughty edition or whatever

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Coming out on Xbox 360 does include

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
A mouse pad with fake boobs on it

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
And a pillow case with some chick on it

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
So that's going to be kind of neat

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Harvest Moon

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Hero of Leaf Valley coming out on

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
PSP

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Splinter Cell Conviction making its way out

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
On PC this week with wonderful

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
DRM in tow

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
And

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Free Running

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
A parkour sim

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Coming out on the Wii this week

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
2010 FIFA World Cup

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
South Africa coming out on

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Wii and

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I don't remember

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
And PSP I don't think there's a DS version on that one

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
I believe that's it

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Oh no this is actually a pretty good deal

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Pixel Junk Monsters Deluxe

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Making its way out on

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
PSP in the UMD format

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
They've had this originally on

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
The PlayStation Network

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
But now you can buy it on UMD

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Only $10

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
And it includes I believe some of the

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Expansions for that. They're doing the same thing too

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
With Fat Princess coming out a little bit later on

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
In May

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Not a bad thing at all

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Alright. Any of that that you're going to pick up

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Logie?

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
I'm going to try Super Street Fighter 4

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
And Nier

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Yeah I'm going to pick up

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Super Street Fighter 4

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
But this time I'm getting it on PS3

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Because I would like to actually be able to control it better

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
So that's my whole thought there

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
This way you get arcade sticks Rob

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Or just play it over here

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
And you're talking more money

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
But they're worth it

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Xbox 360 in Japan

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Sees the release of Super Street Fighter 4

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
This week as well in a regular and

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Collectors Edition

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Otherwise Splinter Cell Conviction is your other big release in Japan

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
This week. See some of the same games we're getting here

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Also get released in Japan at the same time

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Imagine that

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Looking at some other consoles

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Going over to the PlayStation 3

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Same same. They also get Super Street Fighter 4

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Over there

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Regular and Collectors Edition

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
World Soccer winning 11 2010 gets a price reduction

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
For whatever that's worth

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
If you're a big fan of these soccer sims

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
On the Nintendo Wii

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Not really a lot this week

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Base Fishing Wii World Tournament

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Andukensa X and a game called

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Rooms comes out as well

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
From Hudson. That's all on the Nintendo Wii this week

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
On the PlayStation 2

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
I like the name of this game

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Love Route Zero

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Kiss Kiss Labyrinth

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Yes that's really the name of the game

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Love Route Zero

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Kiss Kiss Labyrinth

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
It's an adventure game

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
You can get shots

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
But the box art looks to be like

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
All these dudes in school outfits

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
But there's this girl who looks like the prom queen

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Yeah why am I trying to figure this out?

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
None of you are going to play it

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I already know that. None of you are going to play it

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Going on to the handheld systems

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
And looking at what is coming out

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
On the Nintendo DS

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Is a big release from Squeenix this week

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
On the Nintendo DS

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
And lastly on the Sony PSP

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Ikitosan Cross Impact

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
And that cross is spelled with an actual X

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Just to be complicated

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
That is coming out in Japan

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
This week

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
That is a sequel to a former

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
PSP game

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
2D scrolling action

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
22 girls in this beat em up game

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
And their clothes come off

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Is that really what this is about?

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Well that's what Ikitosan is about

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Based on what I've seen I guess

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Nice

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
They fight and their clothes rip in very

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Evocative ways I guess

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Also Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
I bet some of you guys might want to get that

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
There's also a full PSP pack for that game coming out

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
And I just like the name of this game

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Marriage Royale Prism Story

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Is also coming out

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
It's an adventure game

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I don't really know what happens in this game

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I guess it's like you play the girl going to get married

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
But I want to point this out there's a screenshot here

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Where you have these three cute little anime girls

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
They're like working out or something

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
That is tragic

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Um actually

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
No I know it's like a swimsuit

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
You know how girls wear the one piece and put the shirt on

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
No no Rob actually that's what

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Um gym uniforms look like

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Really? Yeah they're the little bloomer

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Shorts How's that not caught on over here?

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Cause we're prudes

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Clearly

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
So

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Alright so if you want some

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
You know culturally different things

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
There you can check out that game

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
You probably won't

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Alright how about the UK DarkSakura

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Yeah how about em

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
On the 28th serious Sam HD

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
The second encounter

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
The 30th 2010 FIFA World Cup

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000

Splinter Cell Conviction

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Super Street Fighter 4

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
WarioWare Do It Yourself

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
And Wings of Prey

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
That's it

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Too bad it's not the birds of prey

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Making it's way to a video game

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
That would be kinda awesome

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Or not

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Alright Loki

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Ah yes

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Um

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Okay so we talked a little bit

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Well I said that we had

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Splinter Cell Conviction

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Coming out this week and there's horrible

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
DRM in tow well that might not be

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
That big of a problem

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Apparently the hacker community

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Which I thought this happened weeks ago but

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Maybe they finally figured out

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
How to do it the correct way

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
They have found a way to get rid of the

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
DRM

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
That's in

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
These titles that are being released from

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
MovieSoft including Assassin's Creed 2

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
And Settlers 7

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
And I'm assuming

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Splinter Cell Conviction coming soon

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
It should be easy to modify the work

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
With that and the hacker group of course

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Um

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Involved in doing that was

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I believe

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Skid Row

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Fun name

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Awesome

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
And you know it is a little bit different

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Before they had different hacks that were

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Just emulating

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
The authentication server

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Or they were

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Finding some way to trick this but this

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Actually removes the DRM from

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
The title so

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Um that's interesting

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Now Loki your pal Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
The hack before worked

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Up until a certain point of the game

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Then it locked up so this must be news

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
That now it's working for the entire game

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
There you go

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
So Loki

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
I mean does this really

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Surprise you because I kind of look at this and go

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Yeah I already thought this happened too

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I thought this happened within days after the DRM

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
I'm not surprised

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Especially you know something like

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
This that's annoying a lot of people

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Not only

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
The fact that they're coming out and saying oh

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
This is going to stop piracy for all of our titles

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
It just goes to show

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
You're going to waste money on this

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I mean it slows people down but it

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Definitely doesn't stop it

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
And really in the end the only people that get hurt

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Are the people that legitimately buy the game

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Of course now if you don't like the DRM

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
You can just go search online for the crack

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
So

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Like I just I understand the need for DRM

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Like I'm not like somebody who says

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Oh every game should just like

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Not have DRM at all

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I just think what Ubisoft was doing was overkill

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I mean come on when you disconnect from the internet

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
At all your game dumps

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Like do you know how much I get disconnected from World of Warcraft

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Because Comcast decides to fart on me

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
And it just you know like I'll be in the middle of something

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
And it completely screws up my game

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Like

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Oh my gosh at least that isn't like a long term

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Irritating thing

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Whereas you know I could see if I'm playing through one of these games

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
I'm not at a save point maybe I just cleared

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Like a really tough part of the game it's like

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Oh you're screwed you gotta do it again

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Yeah it'd be different if it was like

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Okay we noticed you're you know

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
It disconnected we're saving your progress

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Now

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
And you know you can restart here later once it

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Reconnects

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I mean that would be semi reasonable

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
To be fair didn't Ubisoft change some of that

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Where it doesn't you don't really get booted

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
For the entire game now or something

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I don't know

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
But the thing is

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I'm not buying their games on PC

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Even if it were buying their games

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Which I'm not so

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I don't know

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Alright

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Well a couple last stories for you guys

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Then we're going to get into the classic game of the week

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Where Dark Soccer is going to walk down the

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Vaults of gaming's history and pick out a game

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
That she thinks you kids ought to check out this week

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
But first something about a newer series

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Something that's kind of been a bit

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Under the radar and I think that is a pity

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
And that is DJ Hero

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
DJ Hero of course we know that DJ Hero

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Is getting a sequel this year

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
And little little details are starting to trickle out

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
About it DJ Shadow

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Apparently is going to be working

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
On the next DJ Hero he actually

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Said in an interview on Radio 1

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It was interesting I'm actually working

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
On the next one as well but yeah it was a

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Trip so there you go

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
He's going to be in the second game also notable

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
He was in the first game too so he's

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Like a repeat and I kind of figured

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
That would happen is that like how many

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
World famous DJ's are there

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Are there really enough world famous

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
World famous

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
There are a lot of DJ's

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I think out there that are world famous

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
But you know how many

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Of them are you going to get to

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Be in DJ Hero

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I was very disappointed that they had

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
DJ Jazzy Jeff and there were no

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
You know

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Will Smith songs in there at all

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
No mixes with Will Smith

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
That was very disappointing

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Well there you go DJ Shadow

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Is going to be in the next game

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
In DJ Hero 2

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
But DJ Hero 1 All Love Is Not Lost

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Loki you'll be happy to hear this

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
There's actually another track pack coming out

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah this one I'm actually kind of excited about

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Last one kind of sucked

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Darude's Sandstorm

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Mixed with Josh Winke's Higher

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
State of Consciousness is one of the songs

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
In the new DLC

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Danny Bird's Red Mist

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
VIP is coming

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Out as well and then this song

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Wolfgang Gartner's Wolfgang's

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
5th Symphony Let me start off by

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Saying that this song reminded me of something

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
That you would see in DDR

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Here's a little clip of what this song

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Sounds like

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It's a little noisy for me

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Sounds like a remix song from Boom Boom Rocket

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Remember how Boom Boom Rocket had nothing

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But classical remixes

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And it's really hard too

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Like that's the other catch is that the song is

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Incredibly hard and I guess all these songs that are in

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
This pack are supposed to be a very high difficulty

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Hence why they are calling it

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
The Domination Pack

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Because you can't just say it normally

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
It's the Domination Pack

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Yippie Skippy

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Are we going to be dominated?

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Apparently you will be dominated

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
By the Domination Pack

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
So

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
But yeah I guess that song sounded okay

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
It's a little noisy for me

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
But I guess that's because there was so much mixing going on

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I don't know

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I think that that's the thing

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Some of the effects are a little overdone

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
There's people that are going to like it

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Don't get me wrong

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Alright I don't know if I'll buy it

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I'm curious to hear what the other songs sound like though

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Anyhow let's get to the part of the show

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Where we like to take a trip down the

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Halls of gaming history

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Dark Soccer

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Dark Soccer is going to jump into the vault

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And dive in and find a game

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
That she says hey you ungrateful little

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Children

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Because she says that a lot

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Not teaching him Doctor Who references

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I didn't teach him that

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
He watches Doctor Who

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
You kids ought to be

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Playing this classic video game

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
So you can see where the games of today came from

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Dark Soccer what is the

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Classic video game of the week this week?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Warcraft Orcs and Humans

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Oh snap

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I didn't put this in for all of you addicts

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Who don't know your roots

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Fair enough

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Warcraft Orcs and Humans

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Freaking boring ass game

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
This game is awesome

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Shut your mouth

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
See I wanted that reaction

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
So I didn't put this in

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Really for me

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Because I hate real time strategy games

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I don't like them I do not have fun with them

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
There are enough of you

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
That don't know where your game came from

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Sorry

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
No it's true there's not

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
There's a lot of people that play World of Warcraft

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
That never played a Warcraft game before

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I mean it's worth noting

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I actually mentioned to someone

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
When World of Warcraft just came out

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Did you play Warcraft before?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
No it just came out

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Poor childhood

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I see so tonight is about edumacation

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
It's about edumacation

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
It's a real time strategy game

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
It came out in 1994

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
November 1984 and came out on the Mac in 96

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
It was a sequel Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And then of course

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Warcraft 3

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Warcraft 3 came out not too long ago

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
If you look on Dan's little shelf there

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
He's got a copy

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
So Dan obviously likes it

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It's basically

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
You know like I said real time strategy

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Where you have the humans of Azeroth

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Against the invading orcs

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And then both sides have to

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Fight off wild monsters

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Sometimes you can

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Enlist the monsters

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So basically

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
You've got your melee groups

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
You have ranged groups and spellcasters

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
It is built

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Off of the Dune 2

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Gameplay

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Which is like build a base, build an army

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Destroy the enemy

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Blah blah blah

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Different mission types where you have

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Rebels of each player

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So you can

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Rescue, rebuild towns

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And friendly forces

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And do all this other stuff

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And you also have to be able to

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Efficiently use your platoon

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Also

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
In one mission you have to kill the orc chief's

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Daughter or something

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
It also

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Let you use

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Lands

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
So that you could play against each other

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
So it had that

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Start of the MMO remember

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Sorta yeah

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Like the old school battle net

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
But I was more Diablo

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
On battle net

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Well you have to go through

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
With this you also have to cultivate

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Your resources

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Be careful about where you dig for gold

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Where you chop your wood

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
If you exhaust your resources

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Then you have to get them

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Differently

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
You have to basically

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Regrow your forest while you're taking

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
From them, you have different types of magical

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Buildings, you have

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Different types of sorcerers

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Like you have a cleric, you can have

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Necrolite that raises skeletons

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Ooh

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Elementals, that type of thing

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
The conjurer versus

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
The warlock you know

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Um

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
And then of course it's sort of an overhead

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Interface

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And it's a click and point

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Um

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Yeah you know

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It actually

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Was

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I see I thought

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
That it was

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I played some a little bit but like I said I don't really care for

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
RTS games

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
They just I'm sort of like what

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I can play them and I'm good at them

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I'm just sort of like what this is boring

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
But

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
It clearly caught on I mean

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Cause remember we had you know

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Starcraft

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
You know the whole

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I guess themes to the game sort of caught on

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
To and I mean now we've got World of Warcraft

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Making it you know less sucky

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Again this is Jamie who

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Does not like RTS's

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I actually own this game

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
And I loved it so

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
There is actually an RTS game

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
That I like but it's a Macross game

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
That came out on um

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
The uh PC Engine CD

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I will say this though I am weird

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I fully admit I'm weird cause I don't really

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Care for Starcraft and I

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
To this day have never played Warcraft 3

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
You've got it right here

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I just for some reason have never played it

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I really should because maybe some of the stuff

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
In World of Warcraft will make more sense

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
But yeah I have played the old school Warcraft

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And I did play Warcraft 2

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And I actually tried to make it a point to put in games

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
That I can be really excited about

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
But it was just you know

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
It seemed to me that with everybody

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Being all

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
World of Warcraft World of Warcraft blah blah blah blah

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
You know it helps to know

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Where it came from it helps to go back to your roots

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Um so as

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Far as other um

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Ones that came out though it did have some uh

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Predecessors things that actually

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Um

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Would uh

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Inspire the game and build the

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Groundwork for it there was

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Definitely some competitors

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Um

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Like I said Dune 2

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Um and then Warcraft works and humans

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Came out after that

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Um

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And then um

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
There was actually a random map generator

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
That was for it

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
And that came from

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Civilization Rob

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Yes

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I thought that you'd find that interesting

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Um

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Command and Conquer actually um

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Borrowed from

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Warcraft and Age of Empires

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Um put all of them in

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
In the random map generator when it came out

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Um Modern Wars

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Um for the Commodore 64

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
What uh incorporated

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
The use of land play

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
So it really

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Not only was it influenced by

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Some others but it actually pulled influence

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
It's actually even listing realms as

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
An old Amiga and Atari ST

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Um game as being an influence on it

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Um

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And of course for sequels we got

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
In 95 and

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Warcraft 2 Beyond the Dark Portal in 96

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
And then um

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Coming out later

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Of course was Warcraft 3

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Um Reign of Chaos

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And then there was Starcraft like I said

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And Starcraft Brood War and

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
World of Warcraft

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And soon as Starcraft 2 for you RTS fans

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Yeah I was about to get to that

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
So yeah Warcraft you know

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
It's expanded there's

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Card games, comics, there's a ton of books

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
You've seen the books I'm sure

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
They actually um there's actually

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
A film called Warcraft

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
In production to be out in 2011

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Yeah Spider-Man dude's

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Doing it right?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Yeah I think there's also um

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
There's board games too

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Um but yeah

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Warcraft it really did

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Kinda spur a whole you know

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
A whole big thing

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
11 million people

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Can't be wrong or can they?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Addicts

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Addicts

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Your classic game of the week a true

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Classic indeed in every way

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Shape and form don't listen to Dark Sakura

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
No I'm not saying it's a

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Bad game I'm saying I don't like

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
RTS's

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And I and even that's including

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Actraiser Warcraft oh you

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Don't like Actraiser I didn't say I don't

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Like Actraiser Actraiser

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Is a good game I get bored

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Bored bored after a while

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I'm gonna cry alright

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Oh Rob there's a there's a difference

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Between thinking something is crap

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And just not liking the genre of it

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Yeah

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I can see that I'm trying to think if there's something

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
I feel that way about I do every so often like

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
You know smiting people in Actraiser

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
See I would say that's how I feel about

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Sports games but like I can go back and play

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Old school sports games no problem like I love Tecmo

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Bowl, Blades of Steel like the way they used to be before they

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Just got super high impact like

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Yeah before they got like really complicated

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
But that that's my point you know

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I I'll start playing and I'll be like yeah

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
This is cool then I'm like uh huh

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I will say

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Not my thing I might have liked Warcraft

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
But I wasn't very good at it I never got very

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Far in it like I'm not good

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
At RTS's

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
This whole thing I can

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Do the strategy just fine

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I just get bored with it it's not

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Really my thing

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Alright fair enough

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Uh if you would

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Like to suggest a classic game of the week

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Too bad Dark Soccer doesn't take suggestions

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
By the way actually but you could always try the

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Mailbag I need help from the chat room

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I'm looking for a

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
PlayStation copy

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Of NBA Jam

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
If you find it

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
No matter what variety

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Of version it is for the

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
PlayStation first PlayStation

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Let me know

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
What's the reason? Dan wants it

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
And it's

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Actually hard to find Really?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Yes We are looking

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
To add it to the collection because we have everything else

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
We want

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000

Alright I hope you find it He's on fire

In the vault playing NBA Jam

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
For days

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
In a row If you could find

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
The PlayStation 1 you could play it on a PS3

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Which is the cool thing Yes Because PS3's

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
They all have backwards compatibility no matter what one you have

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Yes but we also do still have

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
A functional PlayStation Oh nice

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
That still had the IO port

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And everything so we can use our little

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Clipping thing Good times But I want

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000

Out of the Capcom event this week

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I mean a lot of it we reported last week as rumors

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
They've turned to fact

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
But we do have some extra details to come with that

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000

The 25th of April 2010

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
For episode 364

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Of our little program where we talk about

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Video games and

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It's been a fun show so far tonight

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
We've had news about DJ Hero

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Yes even a type of

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Food company that apparently Jamie won't say

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Where they save the arcades at

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Campaigns some Marvel vs. Capcom news

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
DRM debates

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Television on the Xbox and plenty more news

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
To go through this week

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Loki why don't you start us off with some fast

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
News tonight

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Yes there's some WiiWare releases

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Coming soon on

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
May 17th

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Including that well

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
The next title in the Bit.Trip

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Series Bit.Trip Runner

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Will be coming out that day on WiiWare

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And also there's some

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Summer DSiWare release

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Dates as well to share

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Including Photo Dojo

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Which looks like a side scrolling

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Fighting game that uses a DSi's

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Camera to add you to

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
The game

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
That's kind of neat I guess

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Kind of gimmicky but fun

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Earthworm Jim

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Coming out also on

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
May 10th

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And apparently I guess that's going to be an

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Update to the SNES version

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Of the game

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Really

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Another Frogger game

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Frogger returns

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Yet again on

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
People must be buying them Loki

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
May 24th

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Konami has Frogger

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Metal Torrent

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
On May 24th

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Is a

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Kira developed Shmup game

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
It looks pretty awesome

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Xscape

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Is I guess a

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Sequel to Game Boy

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Title

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Or I guess a title X

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
From Q Games

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And it's like a first person

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Tank combat game

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
But really trippy looking

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And then some other stuff

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Coming out

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Hero of Sparta

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
On May 31st

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Flame Trail on June 7th

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And Akapa's Trail on

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
June 14th

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Then also another title that's going to be

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Coming soon

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
This is kind of a pseudo

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
3D game

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Luxley's

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Lineup

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And what's kind of unique about this

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
This is a game that came out in Japan

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
On DSiWare as well

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And it's kind of a 3D game

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
It uses the

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
DSi's camera

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
To kind of trick the user

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Into

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Viewing the environment

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
In kind of a 3D dimensional fashion

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
You basically tilt the screen around

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And doing so will change your perspective

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
In the game

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And it's basically kind of a hidden

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Objects game I guess

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
It looks kind of cool

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Coming out as well

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And then non-DSi related

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Stuff

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Battlefield Heroes

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Is going to be getting some more

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Upgrades

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
In the form of

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Jetpacks

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
As well as some new maps and

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
New game mode

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
They're going to be getting

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
That's funny

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I forgot that they had the

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Michael Jackson content that one time

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Anyways

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I guess they're going to be getting

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
A new map

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Called Midnight Mayhem

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And a new mode that's going to be called

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
V2 Vengeance

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Where players must capture and control

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
A giant rocket

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
But hey

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Look, see they're

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Bringing out jetpacks before Halo Reach

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Can

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Do you think that's why they're doing it?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Maybe

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Maybe to get the jump on it?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I don't know

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Just to be fun

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Alright

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Going to some other release dates coming up

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
We have some Xbox release dates

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And some of the games that are coming out for the rest of April

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
On April 28th

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
New Game Room releases

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
That's right, finally some new titles for Game Room

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And these will be under

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Microsoft's Game Room pricing

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Of either $3 for one

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
$5 for both or $0.50 for one play

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Super Breakout from Atari

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Pitfall and Mega Mania from Activision

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I don't remember Mega Mania

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Is that a game that rings a bell to you?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Mega Mania by Activision

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I know the name, I just don't remember the game

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I can't remember it either, I certainly know Pitfall

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Night Stalker from Mattel

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I'm assuming that's in television

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Rack Em Up by Konami

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Real Sports Volleyball by Atari

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And Basketball by Atari

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
So those are all some new Game Room releases

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Certainly I think Pitfall and Breakout are probably the standouts there

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Although I want to say Mega Mania

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Ringing a bell

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
But there's some other stuff on Xbox Live

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
This week we had Puzzle Chronicles and After Burner Climax

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
You know I meant to check out Puzzle Chronicles

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Even though it looked a little weird

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But next week is Tecmo Bowl on the 28th

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
So that's pretty cool

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Also some Mega Man 10

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Releases on the 28th

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
The Endless Attack mode

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And two more special stages

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Special Stage 2 and Special Stage 3

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And then BioShock 2 gets the Rapture Metro pack

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
On April 29th

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
As well as a Black Market Aerial pack

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
For Just Cause 2 on April 29th

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Being added to Games On Demand

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
On April 27th

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Shrek the 3rd, Far Cry 2, and

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Kane & Lynch Dead Men

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And I don't know if Loki's interested

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
But if he wants to pimp out his avatar with Saints Row 2 items

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
He can do that on April 28th

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I'm surprised that they're even doing that

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Seeing as the game came out what, two years ago?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I mean seriously?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Isn't it a little late?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Is it a missed opportunity much?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Alright

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Farmville News

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I can't believe I'm reporting on this

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
What does this show come to?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But I think it's important to say

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
No I'm not going to tell you how to make money

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Harvesting pineapples or whatever

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
But I think it goes without saying that Farmville

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Is expanding beyond Facebook

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
And this would be because of a website

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I guess that spies on domain names

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
That people are registering

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
And Zanga, the company behind Farmville

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Has registered FarmvilleAndroid.com

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
FarmvilleiPad.com

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
FarmvilleiPhone.com

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And FarmvilleSMS.com

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And those are all

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Domain names that are registered

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
By the Farmville folks

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
There you go

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
By the way I guess they're all also forwarding to

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Farmville.com

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
So there you go

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
So needless to say

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Farmville is slowly taking over the world

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Run while you still can

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
If you're worried about Fishville or any of that yet

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Also worthy of mention

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
There's a rare NES game called

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Euphoria

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Not like EU but U-F-O-U-R-I-A

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Euphoria

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It's been rated by the OFLC

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Which is the Australian Ratings Board

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
This means that a virtual console release

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Is likely possible

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
What's interesting about this game

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It's pretty rare but it was actually done by Sunsoft

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
You might remember Sunsoft recently

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Is kind of having a re-arising

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
They put out Blaster Master on Virtual Console

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
There was that OK

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Blaster Master upgrade game

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
That also hit Virtual Console

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Now apparently Euphoria the Saga is

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Coming out as well. It's a Metroidvania

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Type of game is what they're saying

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
It's a NES game

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And it stars this character

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
You get separated from his friends

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And you are looking through the world for your lost companions

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I guess it's kind of like Goonies 2 in that regard

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Hey actually that sounds kind of awesome

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Goonies 2 is kind of Metroidvania 2

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
So there you go

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
The game was released in Europe just so you know

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But I don't believe it was ever released actually in the US

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Hence why it's rare

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
So there you go Euphoria possibly

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
On Virtual Console but usually those ratings news

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Means yeah yeah they're coming

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It's a cute little game

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Real quickly before Jamie takes over with some news

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
The chat room is again complaining that the stream

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Had failed and I guess we blacked out for a little bit there

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Unfortunately

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
We don't know what causes it

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And Bobby Blackwolf

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Wants to clarify because you guys are hearing

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
That little bumper that says

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
All games are switching between it's live and on demand

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Then that must mean it's on our end and it's not the all games computer

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
However we are not doing

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Anything out of the ordinary

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
There's no one else's here but us 3's

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
There's no Xbox games going on or nothing

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
So you can thank Jamie's lovely internet provider

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Hey!

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Comcast. It's Comcastic

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
They were a wonderful shade of crap this morning

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
You know what my Warcraft has been going down too

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
In the area so you know what

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Nobody's running porn

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
We did a porn check

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Everything's fine so we just

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
We gotta keep on rolling with the show sorry guys

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
By the way

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I do want to clarify that specifically

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
It is tournament edition

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
NBA Jam tournament edition for Playstation

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
That I'm looking for

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Yes there's some on Amazon

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
But Dan hasn't told me I can buy it yet

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Anyway

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Brightband updates we have some new

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Tracks coming out

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
There is Busted

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Thunderbirds are Go

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
For 160

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Microsoft points and 200

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Wii points

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Flyleaf again and Silverchair

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Tomorrow

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I don't see anything about an actual

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Pack

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Just the 3 tracks

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Also somebody finally beat Castlevania

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
With a DDR pad

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
The old school

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Castlevania like the first one

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
This dude named Nick Hagman

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Played

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
The virtual console

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Original Castlevania

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Using a DDR Mario

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Mix controller

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And it took 62 lives

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
In more than 4 hours

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
But he did it

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Wait a minute I'm looking at the YouTube here

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Of the guy I guess who did it here

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I don't want to hear his little monologue

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I just want to see him play

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
And it looks like he's

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Well in some pictures he's just

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Sitting kind of using his hands but now

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
On this YouTube I'm looking where he's fighting Dracula

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
He is actually using his feet

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
To do it so

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Cause I was gonna

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Criticize this a little bit if he was actually just sitting

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
There kind of hitting the buttons but apparently he's actually

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Dancing around I wonder if this kid lost weight

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Doing it although he looks pretty

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Skinny to begin with so

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Wow

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I slayed Pounce and

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Dracula

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Congratulations I guess

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Yay for you

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
You have more time than I do

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
A winner it's you

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And then Marvel vs Capcom

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Comic books actually Udon

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Who's been doing a lot of the Street Fighter

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And you know basically any of the

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
The Capcom related

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Comic titles that have come out

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Are actually already

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Discussing

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
The

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Possibility of doing

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Marvel vs Capcom

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Of course they have to get the okay through Marvel as well

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Marvel does their own thing

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
So who knows it'd have to be

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Like a joint release but

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Marvel does what Marvel wants

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Yeah but hey it could be cool

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
It could be kind of interesting

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
What would you want to see in a Marvel vs Capcom

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Comic book?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Deadpool

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
The Adventures of Deadpool

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
And Dan

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Deadpool and Dan

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Disney vs Capcom

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
The actual Dan is here to say something

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Disney vs Capcom

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Disney vs Capcom

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I want Deadpool and Dan

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
How would that work?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Deadpool and Dan

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Alright

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I don't even know what's happening anymore

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Help me

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
My husband hijacking the show again

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Yeah again

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
TheShadowSniper sent us some tweets saying

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I'm unable to listen live because I work late Sundays

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I do carry around my Blackberry

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Is it possible to listen live through my phone?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Ooh

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Unfortunately we know of an iPod app

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
An iTouch app

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I guess it runs on the iPad

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
That's the all games radio app

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
If you just search for all games

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Or allgames.com in the iTunes store

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
That's a great way to listen

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Unfortunately you're asking about the Blackberry

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
My advice would be

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Get one of those, there's got to be like a radio tuner

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Type app depending if your Blackberry

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Has apps

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
You would actually be able to

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Tune into the feed directly

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
It's just a shoutcast feed

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
So any feed that will do shoutcast streams

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
You can listen to all games radio on

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
TheShadowSniper also asks

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
What game ending is your favorite

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Because of its twist ending

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Or its great conclusion

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
This is a good topic I don't think we've

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Talked about in a very long time

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Favorite video game ending, DarkSakura?

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Huh? Favorite video game ending

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Favorite video game ending?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
It was a twist?

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
It doesn't have to be, it says

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
What was your favorite because of its twist

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Or great conclusion?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I don't really know

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I mean I loved all the million endings

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
For Chrono Trigger

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
That goes without saying

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
I loved the multiple endings for Symphony of the Night

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Oh no

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Richter's dead

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
He was controlled by Shaft

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
You know

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I have to say that

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
My favorite ending

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Is Maria's ending from

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Dracula X

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Where she's walking along with her happy

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Mamba music

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Her animal buddies are following her along

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Yeah, because that really goes with the Castlevania

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Game

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Loki?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I like the ending to Final Fantasy VI

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I was kind of

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Going to go along those lines too

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
And say Final Fantasy IV was actually my favorite

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Ending, it was like a 20 minute

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Epic ending back in the day

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Good stuff, that was one of my favorite endings

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
As far as like a twist

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Ending, I'm trying to remember games that had like a twist

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
That made me go like, oh my gosh

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I don't know, for some reason

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I'm not thinking of any I've thought in my head right now

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Plus, you have to remember I have Gamer ADD

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
So I don't beat a lot of video games

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I play them for about an hour and then I'm like, ooh

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Shiny, I'm gonna go play something else

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
So

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
But yeah, you know the Final Fantasy series is always

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Dependable for good endings, I think those are

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Definitely up there

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
So, alright

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Also, I always loved the endings in

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Street Fighter II

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
The little stories that were just so random

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Always favorites of mine too

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Let's see, Spazinator PSN

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Says, I can't exactly say when

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
But hopefully if all goes well

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Down the time I anticipate some

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Epic news

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Well, you can't just leave it at that

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Say what the epic news is

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Okay, Tigerclaw gives us like a ton of

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Gaming links and we don't have time to

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Read them all, I'm sorry, it's kind of a lot

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
We got a lot of Twitter topics tonight

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
But I'll read at least a couple of these here

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Yosho Inori Ono says

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Ask Capcom if you want another

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Dark Stalkers game

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I'm sure there's a lot of people that want to see

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
A new Dark Stalkers game come out

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And this is an interview with Video Games

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Daily during a Super Street Fighter IV

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Preview in London

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Yosho Inori Ono, who is the Super Street Fighter IV

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Producer, he actually has said that

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
You know what, he wants to make a sequel to

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Dark Stalkers, which of course if you've never

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Played it, it was awesome, it was like a fighting game

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
It was like Vampires and other like

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
There were sequels, there were

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Punches of sequels

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
There hasn't been one in years, you know what I mean

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Just like Marvel vs Capcom, there hasn't been one in like

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Ten years, so

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Anyhow, he says that he always

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Tries to talk about Dark Stalkers in interviews

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
And he wants to show Capcom that there's a

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Demand for a new game, he says quote

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I am desperate to make this game

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
That's a pretty bold statement

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
So you know, flood

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Capcom with your letters, you know when you're

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Gonna send your hate mail about their DRM

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
You might want to just send some

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Postcards to say, oh by the way, PS New Dark

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Stalkers please

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
But don't screw it up with DRM, don't you dare

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Let's see, also I think worth mentioning here

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Sony is going to be discontinuing

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
The three and a half inch floppy disk in

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Japan, aww

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Memories, aww remember

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Three and a half inch floppies, we were just

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Talking about them last week

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
They were still making them

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Yeah, they still make them, at least in Japan

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
I want a box of them, to make something out of

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Can't you still get them

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
In like Office Max or something?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I can actually get them at school

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Maybe Dollar Tree has it

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Yeah, probably Dollar Tree

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Nice, yeah well unfortunately

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Sony has said that in 2011

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
There will be no more

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Three and a half inch floppy disks

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Available, they were first

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Introduced in 1981

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And really sold abroad in Japan in

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
1983, they had their

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Peak in the year 2000, but

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
As you can probably imagine

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Now that you have USB drives

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And CDs

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
And other types of storage mediums

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
What ever happened to zip drives?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Remember zip drives are going to be like the next big thing

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I still have like three zip disks around here somewhere

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I have a zip drive

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Or I had a zip drive

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Remember the zip drive?

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
That's what I used to download stuff with

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I make my portable drive

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
So there it is, bye bye, three and a half inch floppy

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
It's like when they got rid of the Polaroids

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Man, remember when that happened

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Alright, let's see

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
One other one, I'll give Tigerclaw one more

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Story because I'm nice and he gave a lot

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
He also sent us a link to a story about

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Early 3D games on PS3

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Featured downgraded graphics

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
It's a story he linked us to

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
On Kotaku

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Well that's a whole other thing we should get into

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
At some point tonight, did you hear about the whole

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Gawker media who owns Kotaku

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
One of their other little

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Websites, did you hear about this whole mess about the iPhone

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
That was found at the bar

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
That bought it for like five thousand dollars

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Or something like that and leaked all the information on it

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
And now they want it back

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Well they got it back

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
What a mess

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
In pieces, right?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
They probably put it back together

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
But yeah, that was a

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Sister blog to Kotaku

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Yeah, I don't know

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
There's more I could say on it

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I'm kind of getting to the point where I just don't care

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
It happened, whatever

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Oh my god, fourth generation

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
iPhone, what?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I just think the way it all went

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
That is so surprising

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
The way it all went down was a little bit

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I don't know the word, I think tacky

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
The one that really rubbed me

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
The wrong way was the story they ran on

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
The guy who lost it

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
You know

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
How would you like that to be you?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I think we've all had that stupid ass moment

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Where we left something or forgot

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And it might have been important, like it might have been school work

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Or you know, shit, I left my

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Coke on the top of the car

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And then I drove off and it flew away

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
But your Coke is not a prototype device

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Of a highly anticipated piece of electronic

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I understand

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
But dude had a bonehead moment

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
And not that it makes it right

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Hey guys, look what I brought with me

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I'm so drunk

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Does it necessitate him being splashed

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
All over this blog and all the details about his Facebook

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
And all this stuff? It's tacky

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
It's just tacky

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Anyway

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
So tacky website sister reports

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
That there's

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
The PS3 apparently

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Might have some downgraded graphics

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I guess Wipeout HD

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It usually will run in 1080p

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Which is considered, you know, it's the Uber HD

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
It has to actually be scaled back to

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
720p to run in

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
3D

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Motorstorm, it's top resolution with 720p

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
It actually has to be scaled back to less than that

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Which would not even be considered HD

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
In order to run in HD

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Okay, but

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
That's not true

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
No, less than that

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
It's basically pulling a halo

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Where, you know, they just uprise everything

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
But it's not true

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
HD

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Wasn't Sony the same company that marched out there and said

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
We have true HD

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Yeah, just like all of our games are gonna be 1080p

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Running at 120 frames per second

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
You know

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Smoke goes towards my ass

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
You know

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Um

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
It's not surprising that they're gonna have to cut down

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
The graphics a little bit

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
But I don't think you're gonna really notice when everything's

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Flying towards you

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Um

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Obviously it's gonna take more processing power to

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Display, you know

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Those images

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
It's gonna have to refresh twice as fast

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Whatever

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I'm so over 3D

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Like, fuck 3D, seriously

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I'm over it

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Like, now it's just like everything

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Every fucking movie's in 3D

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
And every game's gonna be redone in 3D

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
3D this, 3D that, 3DS

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Fuck 3D

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Fuck it

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Blue Swim

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
You're gonna get a 3DS

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Maybe

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
We'll see

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
If it hurts my eyes, I don't know

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Hey, I have one, it's called a Virtual Boy

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And it gave me a migraine

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
That says, any thoughts on the new DDR game

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Coming out for the 360 later this year

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
That features Coldplay and Jordan Sparks

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And then links us to the thing

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I thought this game was coming out last year

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I thought that was gonna be last year's DDR game

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
What happened? It got delayed?

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
A year?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
It's not a new DDR game, it's still that last one that hasn't come out yet

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
The one that was at last E3

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
It was just

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
They're like, we're just gonna call it Dance Dance Revolution

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Cause that's not confusing at all

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Blue Swim

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
It's really hard to say

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Until we see the game in motion

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I mean, I can look at the song list

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And go, meh, whatever

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
But I really wanna see if they finally took the advice

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Of, you know, just rebuild the game from the ground up

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
It sounds like they might have

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Because it is supposed to have all these new modes and stuff

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
But I'm not gonna hold my breath, let me put it that way

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I'm kinda over DDR

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So it's gonna take a lot to bring me back

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I know that's a sad thing for me to say

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
But I guess

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Even a new BeatMania 2DX game was announced this week

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And I was just kinda like, meh

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Whoopee

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Whoopee

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Let's see

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Dark Tetsuya sends us a tweet that says

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I found this on the La Mulana WiiWare blog

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
It's an interesting article about religion in video games

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Hmm

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Alright, let's see what this is all about

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I'm going into the

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Blog here

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I have to read this whole thing?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Come on, I'm not gonna read this whole thing on air

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Okay, I guess I can read some of it

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Again, this is the La Mulana blog

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
It has to do with religion in video games

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
One of the difficult things when Japanese make games

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
For foreign countries is the problems with faith

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
From the historical background of Japan

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
The interest in faith has been weak

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
It's difficult to understand the feeling of things

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Such as making vows with a hand over the Bible

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
During the presidential inauguration

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Or how Islamic faith views the absolute moral

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
This may be obvious when you look at how

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Japanese games borrow names from monsters

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And items from various beliefs, civilizations, and myths

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Still more

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
La Mulana is further created with an

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Absurd theme that its roots are from

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
All ancient civilizations around the world

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Da da da

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I'd like to briefly explain the view of faith in Japan

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Japan is a civilization separated from the continent

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And because the land is small

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
There are few open fields

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Japan's people have prospered by officially obtaining food

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
As farmers

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
There are many earthquakes and because of few resources

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
There are only a few ruins created from large stones

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I believe that the sense of not wasting

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Came from utilizing the limited resources

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
In the faith born from within the continents

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Culture exists a god

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Even though there is a difference between monotheism

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And polytheism, thinking about the many existing

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Fears, living beyond a vast

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Continent and harness of nature could have brought

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Forth the absolute existence

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Da da da goes on to talk about the

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Do not waste philosophy and so on

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Meaning there is no harm

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Meant when Japanese games add elements

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
From the beliefs of foreign countries

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
And it can't just end there, so what's okay and what's bad

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Needs to be thought out because there's no such rule

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Existing, what's the best is to have the

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
World's religionist check but that would not

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Be possible

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So it's just kind of interesting to read this blog

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Kind of talking about you know these guys

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Having to consider this and all the development of

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
La Mulana when you know

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
It's maybe not such a big deal in some parts of the world

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
But they've got to be careful not to offend

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Because everything's got to be politically correct

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
So

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
If you want to check that out

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Slash en for the English one

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
And this is called

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Problem of faith and I'll link it to you

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Guys in the chat but those of you listening

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
To the podcast La-mulana

Slash en for the English version

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Okay last couple

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Tweets here and then we got to close up the

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Twitter Alex P. Carson

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
On Twitter says 364 episodes

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Not bad you guys are my second

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Favorite podcast

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Second favorite

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Second favorite

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Want to guess who we lose to?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Dig Nation

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I know

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Rob's going to have a diva stomp

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
We're just going to have to try harder

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
But he says keep up the good work

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
No and all joking you know whatever

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I can say I've never listened to an episode of that show

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
So I don't know maybe they're awesome and I just don't know

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
It's well Kevin

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Yeah I know who's on it but does that make me care anymore?

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
No

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Well because it's a translate thing

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
It's like a Google translate

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Okay I hope that's all it is just because

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
It's just kerned badly

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Well the Japanese it's developed by Japanese

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Obviously so you know it's just

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Probably run through the Google translate

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Yeah and then

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Spazinator sends a last tweet

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Saying sorry I'm nixing the epic news

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Oh well how do you

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I know something you don't know never mind

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Whatever

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Let's move on with some more gaming news

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Then we're going to get to our Skype line a little later in the show

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
1877 game OLR

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Not yet we've got some more gaming news

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Mailbag and all that fun stuff

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Logie why don't you get us back to gaming news

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Ah yes well

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
One of the things that was announced

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I want to say Tokyo Game Show

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Wow Mac was that

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
For Dead Rising 2 they're going to be

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Doing some sort of

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Different things

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Other than the last game of course

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
One of them being co-op in the game

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
And in fact they are

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Going to allow you to play through the entire

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Single player campaign with

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Another person

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Which is awesome

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And really the way they should have done it in the first place

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Um

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
And then also

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Let's see here

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Oh great and then that disappeared

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
For some reason go Comcast

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Um

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Now the other player that you play

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
As I'm not sure if it's um

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I guess it's a clone of your own character

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I mean they're both Chuck Green

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Not some other character

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
That you play as but um

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
It's going to be pretty awesome and they're

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Going to have some different mini games you can play as well

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Um

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I want to say there's like card playing

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
And

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Different events and stuff that you can do

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
But hey

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
That's pretty sweet that they're going to have something other than

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Just like that Deathmatch

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
American gladiator-esque

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Mode in the game

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Yeah I got to admit co-op sounds kind of rad

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
So I'm looking forward to that

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Yeah so um

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
One of the other things I saw too

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Um

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Was that they were talking a little bit about

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
The

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Demo slash prequel game

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
That they're going to be putting out

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Um the

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I want to say what was it called

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
I can't remember

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Anyways um

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
That should be coming out

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Pretty soon I would think because I think

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Dead Rising 2 if I remember correctly

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Is scheduled for August right now

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Well

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Right now but you know we just heard

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
About a bunch of other games getting pushed back

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
So maybe these games will get pushed back too

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Yeah

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Maybe but Capcom usually doesn't move stuff around too much

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
We'll see what happens

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
God I just can't wait to play the game though

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Yeah the more and more

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
I'm hearing about it the more it sounds kind of awesome

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Even if Frank West isn't in it after all

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Well

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
It would be funny if he made a cameo

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I mean you never know

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
They're saying that he's not in it now

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
But I mean

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
You know

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Might be funny if he has some big role in it

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Or something later on

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Well a new trailer also was released

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Out of the Capcom press event that was pretty much

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Already spoiled on last week's show

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
One of the things that came out was a trailer

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
For Bionic Commando Re-Arm 2

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Oh awesome

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And there's that little

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
That's right

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
It's redesigned and it's rebuilt

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
And I guess the big thing now is that

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
He can actually like jump

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Now

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Well that takes up the point

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Yeah so now he can jump and use the arm

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
So there it is

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
That's the big change in Bionic Commando

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Re-Arm 2

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
It will be on Playstation Network and Xbox Live

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
The first quarter of 2011

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
New weapons, attacks and all that

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Fun stuff

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
It's being developed by Fat Shark

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Because you know Grin did the first one right

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And they're not there anymore

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
New physics based puzzles

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
There will actually be a two player co-op in this game as well

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
New graphics, new score

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
But it will be inspired by NES

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Which kind of brings me back to

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
What makes this game very interesting in the first place

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Bionic Commando Re-Armed was an upgrade

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Of an actual NES game that existed

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Called Bionic Commando

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
So this is a sequel to a

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Retro remake

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
That isn't based off anything

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Isn't that weird?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I don't know if it's not based off anything

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Some of the stuff reminded me of the arcade game

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Of Bionic Commando

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Wasn't there a rumored sequel in development too

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
That just didn't end up happening

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I want to say I'd read a while ago that there was a rumored

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Sequel in development so maybe some of this is bits and pieces

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
But still the point remains

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
You have a sequel to a retro game

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
That doesn't actually exist

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Which I find very interesting

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
In a way

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
But it's still got that same art style and everything

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
And despite the jumping

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Kind of being

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Huh? For Bionic Commando

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I guess it could be cool

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
And remember how I was saying too

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
About the release date

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
For Dead Rising 2

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
They're also showing as August 31st

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
On

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I guess this is news coming from

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
X10

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Hmm

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Just in time for the end of

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Summer and Labor Day. Good stuff

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Alright

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Anyway that's Bionic Commando re-armed too

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
And look for more news on that

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
As we get closer to the first half of 2011

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Dark Soccer

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Well

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
This is some good news and actually the screen

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Capture is in French

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
But there is a

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Screen capture that was submitted

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
That shows a particular game

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
For Xbox Live Arcade

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And that would be Jet Set Radio

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Um

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
It could be

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
It could not be. It could have just been a

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Place holder by someone wanting to

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
You know cause

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Sonic 4 Episode 1 is on the list

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
And you know

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
But other stuff like Quake Arena arcades

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
You know Clash. That's real. Yeah

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
So it's real? Yeah it's real. It's off of

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
That's the

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Partner net stuff

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Some of which has already been leaking online

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
And they're cracking down on it pretty big

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Yeah I was like it's in French

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
No it's the same guys

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
That released information

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Well I'm not sure if it's the same person but

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Those same games were on

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Had screenshots leaked out because someone has a

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Dev kit that they bought

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And they're releasing a bunch of screenshots

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
And stuff from games that haven't been

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Announced yet or aren't released yet

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
And stuff like that and then

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
A few of them they actually leaked out the full

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Games out there

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
So

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Yeah but

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
People keep going ok

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Release

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Sonic 4 come on come on

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
You know you want it and they're like no because

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
They're cracking down on it and now they're password protecting

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
A bunch of this stuff and

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
They don't like that too much

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Well I mean I can imagine

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
But well yeah it's not meant for that kind of stuff

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Um

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Dev kits getting

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Sold to

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Random people

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Aren't those things expensive aren't they like ten thousand dollars

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
To get one of those kits? No

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
No cheaper than that? A lot less than that

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Really? Yeah

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
How much would it cost for me to get one?

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
A dev kit? About a thousand bucks

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
I want a dev kit

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
A thousand bucks I'm not sure if that includes

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
The ability to log into Partner net or not

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Um

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I don't know what exactly that takes but

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
You can find them

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
But you know now that there's JTAG

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Consoles out there you don't really need dev kits anymore

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Yeah but a JTAG console

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Can't get on Partner net and get all the details

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
About games that are coming out you know what I mean? That's true

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
But there's other people that can do that for you

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Alright

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Um

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Let's move on with some more news

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Loki

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Ah yes um

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Now there's some other interesting

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Stuff um coming out from

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
The Captivate stuff

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Including you know these are some

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Games that I believe were already out in

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Japan that are making their way out over here

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Um Okameden

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Is coming out on the DS

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Later this year or actually I'm sorry

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Uh 2011

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
And of course that's the sequel to Okami

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Um

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
And it looks pretty awesome

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And then of course um

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
You mean Legend of

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Okami? Legend of Okami

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Alright

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
And then um

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
From the same I'm not sure

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
If it's the creators of the

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Series but at least the same

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Artists um they're releasing Ghost

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Trick Phantom Detective

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Um that's going to be a brand new series

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
And that's supposed to be making its way out

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Later this year

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
And then oddly enough on the Wii and

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
The PS3 Sengoku

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Basara Samurai Heroes is making

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Its way out and I believe that's supposed to be

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Later this year

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Um

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
And that one uh came out

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Well one of the games in the

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Series came out on the Playstation 2

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
A couple of years back um

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Which was uh

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
God I just had the name

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Devil uh

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Devil Hunter I think

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I don't remember but I thought that was the

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Name of the series that came out over

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Here it's basically like uh

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Dynasty Warriors

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Both guns

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Cool guns

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Yeah not really though I hate guns

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
They've had um

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
At least one other Sengoku Basara game

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
That was um

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Basara I guess game that was on

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
The Wii

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
A while back I want to say it was the first

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Second year the Wii was out

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
But they're okay they're kind of cool

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I don't know

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I just wish they was on the 360 too

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I just don't understand why they hate

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Unless it's going to be coming out

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
At a time when they do have the motion controller

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
In play and it's

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Going to be something with that and then maybe I can

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Understand why it's on the Wii and the PS3

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Other than that it's just hating

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
They're just hateful

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Why they hate?

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Don't hate the play I hate the game

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Anyhow

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
This is a game that I

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Tried to like but it kind of

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Drove me bonkers but we had a little tidbit

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
On it last week it's the Lord of Ultima

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
And it was actually released this week

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Yay it was launched and you can actually

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Play it and have fun with it

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
You have to visit the website which was

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I think it was like lordofultima.com

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
You can actually go and play the game

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I tried to play it and it crashed on me

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
During the tutorial

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
So uh yeah

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
But apparently in this game you will

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Set up your own little kingdom and there's little micro

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Transactions and stuff I don't know it sounds

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
A little Farmville to me but with Ultima

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
And you know better

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Graphics and all that stuff but I tried to

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Play it I wanted to review it for you guys but it crashed

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
During the tutorial so I guess I'll have to try again this week

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Is any of our listeners playing? Chatters does anyone

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Try Lord of Ultima that came out this week?

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Anybody?

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Maybe we can have a guild?

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Or a kingdom or

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Something?

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
I don't know. Alright let's get to the part of the show

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Where you guys get to write us and have your say

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
It's our mailbag segment

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Mailbag

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
At orangelandradio.com is the place to send

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Those emails. DarkSakura

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Who's emailing us this week?

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Two people

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
We're drowning in letters

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Redertainment

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Dear OLR I sent you

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
A Twitter topic last week asking why

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Activision had not set up their own bank

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I was not joking about that

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
I was in fact serious

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
What got me thinking was

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
About this was Walmart's effort to create their own bank

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
They wanted to lower the prices

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Of check and credit card processing by

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Cutting out the middle man in this process

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Walmart wanted to establish this bank

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
In the mediocre state of Utah

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Which is how I came to learn about it

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Ultimately the banking lobbies in Utah put the kibosh

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
On this deal and the effort

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Ultimately died

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Activists establishing their own bank assembly lowered

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Processing fees for people playing wow

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
And also act as an additional

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Revenue stream for Activision as if they

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Need another

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I'm not saying this would be good for the consumer

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
The bank of Activision would inevitably

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Church bank customers out the ass for bank fees

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Jack up interest rates on loans and quickly foreclose

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
On the homes of people who were delinquent on payments

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
These deplorable practices

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Would happen because Activision seems only interested

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
In squeezing all the cash they can

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Out of consumers and not serving their customers

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Well like most major banks do today

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I'm not going to say anything

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
I work in the mortgage industry

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
So is there a legal reason why Activision

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Has not established their own bank

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Or is this whole rant evidence

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Of my low opinion of the banking industry

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
In America and of Activision

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Stay care of entertainment

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
This message is brought to you by the Burns Cafe

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
In Taylorsville, Utah where thanks to their choice

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
And the meat they serve you can literally bite an ass

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Well it's a bummer you couldn't fit that

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
In 140 characters or less

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Or the tweet might have made more sense at the time

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Ok I get your joke now lol

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I don't know, Activision is not going to set up a bank

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Like they care

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I get the point you're trying to make

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
But come on

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
It's cute though

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Your email was cute

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Your thought is cute I like that

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Oh this is one we've been included on

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
How nice

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
From Brandon

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Dear C4 and OLR crew

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I got DDR U3

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
With a soft pad

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
And I want some modding help

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
To make it a hard pad

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I want to know why you hate or have not played

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Beat and Groovy

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
That's up to you Rob

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
In my mind it was Pop'n Music for the 360

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
As far as superior

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
God please spell

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Than Pop'n on the Wii

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
I have a suggestion for Konami

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
If they are going to do Pop'n Music Wii V2

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
They should take the normal Pop'n controller

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
And have a slot in it for the Wii remote

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Oh God please

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
This is just awful

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I'm looking for some fun RPGs for the 360 help

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
That's literally how it said

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
I am looking for fun RPGs

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
For the 360 help

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Was this typed on an iPhone?

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
I can type better than this on an iPhone Rob

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
And besides that iPhones

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Auto capitalize and fix your spelling

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Whoever accepted my PA challenge

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Should know

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
That I only have

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
SM and DDR US3

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
And I am looking for an online

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Challenge on Live since the

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Hourly DS Master 26

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
PS I want to find a cop

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
That explains a lot

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
It's with two Ps

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Of Disney Mix for PS1 and Golden Eye Clone for today's

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Consoles

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I have Disney Mix, I have both of them

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
I have the Japanese one and the US one and you can't have it

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Oops, the FU's music

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
How appropriate that the FU's music accidentally

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Starts playing

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
I didn't do that intentionally I swear

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
God there was like five questions in that email

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
What was the first question?

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
I just stopped paying attention

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I was just reading the words

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Can you go back and look for me?

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I closed it

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
SSJ100Matt said that this email

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Fails too many fucking ways

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Okay

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
You want to know how to mod a soft pad

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Look online

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
The way that I know how to do it

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Duct tape it to a piece of plywood

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Seriously? It works?

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Oh yeah, packaging tape

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Do not do the sheet of plastic over it

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Because you'll fall

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
I'm sorry, not that

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
You need to get a clear linoleum

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Or whatever and you put that over the top

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
And then you staple it through the bottom

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
With a staple gun

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
But yes, look online

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
You can also use a power drill

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
And screws

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Although he'd probably screw his foot

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I think

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Because he wouldn't be able to read the instructions

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
DS Master's just not allowed to

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Email us unless it's been

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Spell checked and grammar checked

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Well, you know, Bobby's in chat and says

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
You know he does this on purpose, right?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
The only way to stop it is to not even bother

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
That's what I did, don't give him the attention

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
That's actually what I was just about to say

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
I'm going to stop reading emails from him

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Unless they're typed properly

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
That's fair

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
You need to have somebody proofread it

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And then we might read them

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Might!

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
RPGs on the 360

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Final Fantasy 13

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Is good

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
I guess a lot of people like to

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Even though I did not

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Okay, whatever

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Lost Odyssey, yes, thank you

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Blue Dragon's okay

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
I love Blue Dragon

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Bite my butt

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I will give Blue Dragon this

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
If you liked the Super Nintendo RPGs

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
It's very retro-esque

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Blue Dragon should have just been on the Super Nintendo

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Blue Dragon reminds me of playing a Dreamcast RPG

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
End of story

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
It's like playing Evolution

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Oh, I remember the other one

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
I was like, what the hell are you smoking?

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Beat and Groovy, it's just not a good game

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Beat and Groovy is unfinished

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
It's an unfinished pile of poop

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
That Konami put on the arcade

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
That honestly Microsoft should have rejected

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Like, it's a horrible

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Abortion of a game

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
It's literally, I'm not saying that to be

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
It is literally an abortion

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
It was stopped

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Halfway through it was actually finished

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
And put on the marketplace

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
You have like up to nine star

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Difficulties on songs that are never used

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
There's no song on there that's harder than like

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
A five star difficulty

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
The song list is laughable

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
There was no download content or anything

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Released, it is a bad

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Unfinished, aborted game

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Beat and Groovy

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Do not buy it, I'm not even

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Kidding, don't support that crap

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
I'm gonna put out another pop of music

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Cause I'm guessing one, the Wii one

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Did not sell very well

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Two, Konami doesn't really

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Get the Wii and stuff

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Other than rehashing DDR

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
And putting stuff out there

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
And adding some waggle crap to it

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
I mean, that's really the most

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Effort you get from Konami

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
With some of these games

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
So no, they're not gonna spend the time

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
To make a peripheral for pop of music

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Because it just will never catch on over here

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I'll say this, at least the game had a couple

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Okay songs, like the song list

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Wasn't completely fail, but

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
I'm sorry, you know, you put a

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Poop in sparkly, pretty packaging

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
And it's still poop

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Pop of music is very niche

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
In Japan, so

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Why would you bring something that's

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Incredibly

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Niche over here

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Just fucking fail at it

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I understand wanting to bring the niche thing over here

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
If you do a good job with it

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
That, I mean, was set up for

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Failure from the beginning

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Honestly, I'm throwing this out here

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Whoever is responsible for that game

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Should have been fired

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Like, I'm not even kidding, whoever was responsible for that

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Fire them

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
That was

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Unexcusable, that game

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Period

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Alright

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
What are you giggling at over there, Dark Sakura?

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Are you even paying attention

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
To the show?

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
I just was distracted by something

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
And I found a link to a product

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Called HanderPants

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Underpants for your hands

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
HanderPants?

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Why on earth would you need HanderPants?

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I don't know

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I just think it's funny

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
They're fingerless gloves

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
With the design of underwear

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I'm gonna link it into the chatroom

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Jesus

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
This is the same vein as Mantis

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
And then you go up to somebody

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
And you're like, look at my Mantis pants

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Look at my HanderPants

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I don't care

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Really, I don't

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Look at my Mantis

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Your Mantis?

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
What?

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
It's a real website, Mantis.com

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
I know, I'm sure it is

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
But see, there's people that are into that

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
But like, HanderPants, that

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I don't understand

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
There's some guys that wanna

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
You know, the

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Sorry, Sakura

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Why are you doing this?

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I am so easily distracted

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
today. Oh, it's not funny

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Mantis

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
SSJ100Matt says this topic sounds

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Automatically better than dsmaster's email

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
You know what's funny? We didn't even finish with his

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Email, we just went right on to talking about Mantis

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
And I'm enjoying myself more than I was

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Five minutes ago

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Just

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
You know what?

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I think that should be the rule from now on

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
The rule

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
No, I have it

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I have a new OLR rule

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Could you please get out the stone tablets

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
And get out the chisel

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Cause they're gonna write a new rule

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
When you send us a question

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
To the mailbag

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
And it is so horribly tight

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
And grammar

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Look, if you make a couple mistakes here and there

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I'm not the best with spelling and grammar either

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
But at least if you put out an effort, we're not gonna laugh at you

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
At least you're consistent

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
If you just have a

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Horrible email that you didn't even bother

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
To try with and you typed it like it was a

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Text message on the cell phone

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
We are going to answer your question

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
With Mantis.net

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Is the website you need to go

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
To fix your problem

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
From now on

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Or possibly hand or pants

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
When you send us a question that stinks

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Mantis.net is where you need

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
To go to find your answer

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Try the high cut ones

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Put that on the wiki

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
It's an official rule

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Alright

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Hey, whoever updates their wiki, add it

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Let's go to the

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
I like

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Game suggestion

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
RPG 360

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Well email her, I think you'll find the answer

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
At Mantis.net

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Alright

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Speaking of which

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
These things have flies

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Rob, they do have

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Embroidered briefs

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
You're telling me this like I would want to suddenly

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Go over them? I don't want you to get any

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
I'm just saying that they're funny

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Let's get to the FUs

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
FU to

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
DS Masters email

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
And now you know what

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
I think the rule is just I'm just not answering any more

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
From them, ever

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Lowkey

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
FU to bad drivers

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Two types in particular

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
One, the person that

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Decides hey you know it's going to be a great idea

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
To stop four car lengths before the car

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
That's in front of them

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Making it near impossible to go around them

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Or the fact that they go really slow

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
To accelerate once the light does change

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
And then two

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
The more dangerous type, the people that run

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Stop signs and run stop lights

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
They're there

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
For safety and the fact that you

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Just blow right through them like you don't give

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
A shit, that's how people die

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
So, stop it

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Cause I don't want to die

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Um, I'm sorry I'm laughing too hard

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Cause I'm looking at this website

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I don't really have a lot of FUs

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Of the week

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Actually I had a pretty good week

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
I really don't think I had a lot of bad things

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Happen, I guess FU to those work

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Days that start at 6 AM

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Cause getting up at 5 o'clock to go to work

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Kinda stinks, but at least the days go by fast

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
So, even that's not really a complaint

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Alright, let's get to some more

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Gaming news and then

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
We'll open up the skype line at 1877

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Game OLR and who knows

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
What phone calls we might get tonight

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Uh, Lowkey

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Yes, so you know

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
The whole drama with Infinity Ward

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
And Activision is just nuts

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Activision, they've hired

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
A person to, I guess

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Run their community forum

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Or whatever, Dan

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Amrich

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
And I guess they have a Facebook

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Cause everybody does

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
And he's basically

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Trying to give their side

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I guess of the whole bonus situation

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
For Infinity Ward

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Um, he says

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Vince and Jason had very

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Large bonuses, those bonuses are being

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Redistributed to everyone else

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
To people who did not allegedly

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Attempt to steal company secrets

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Activision

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Is not pocketing the bonus money

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
It's still going to the people who

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Work at Infinity Ward

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
But you have to work at Infinity

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Ward to get it

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
See, I don't want

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
To see talented people screwed out

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Of a paycheck any more than you do

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
So are they trying to be all like

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Hey, we're the good guys, we're gonna pay out those bonuses

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
No, we're gonna pay them, we're gonna pay them

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Don't worry, they're getting a bigger share of the bonus

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Well, why don't you pay their bonuses in the first place

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Because that was the whole problem

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
You weren't paying the bonuses

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
What, the game's been out for

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Almost

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Six months now?

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
What's it like to get a bonus?

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Isn't it time to get the bonuses

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Out there?

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I thought bonuses were just that, a bonus

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Allegedly, why didn't you even put the allegedly

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Attempt to steal company secrets

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
They're the ones that made the game

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I think all their secrets are in their head

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
They don't need to steal anything

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
He's just a douche

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
You know, unfortunately

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
He's sub douche, you know, to the major douche

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Which

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Why even bother having a community?

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
I think this is the same guy I want to say

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Like, why do you hate Activision

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Or whatever, we want your honest answers

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Or something like that

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
It's like, really, you don't know why we don't like you

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I mean, really, you have to ask

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
That's like my wife

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
You know, if like, she's mad at me

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And I'm like, what are you mad at me for?

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
And she's like, really, you don't know

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
That just makes me even more pissed off

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
It's because we expect our spouses to be

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Psychic when we're psychotic

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000
I'm letting the secret out of the bag

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Ooh, you're gonna get nasty emails from the women of America?

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I'm a chick!

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
The women of America don't listen to our show

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
I can get away with saying this

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Because it's exactly what I pull with my husband

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Wait, Dan, you didn't hear that?

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Uh, yeah

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
It says, uh, although it's unclear

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Whether the Romanian Infinity War

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Employees have received their personal bonuses

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
For Modern Warfare 2 yet

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Activision lawsuit claims that

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Zampanelli and Wes

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Allocated to, or, and Wes

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Allocated to themselves approximately

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
One third of the total bonus pool

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
For the Call of Duty franchise bonuses

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Which included

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
The first Modern Warfare game

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Further, it contends that Wes and

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Zampella, um

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Were demanding an even larger

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Share of the bonus pool for Modern Warfare 2

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Oh, so now

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
We're seeing that they're getting too big bonus

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Or too much of a bonus or whatever

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
If they wanted too much of a bonus

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Well, that's too bad that they got fired

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
So that really doesn't make any sense

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Uh, and

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
No word on when this whole thing

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Is gonna be taken care of, but

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
They're thinking that more people are gonna leave

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
So, uh

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Oh, and they have a big ol' quote for

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Activision's countersuit, which I don't really feel like

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Reading, cause it's just a bunch of

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Crap

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
In my opinion

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Ipsofacto

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Sue

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Money

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Let's move on then, shall we?

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
One more story for you guys, then I guess we'll open up

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
The skyfly and see what happens

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Could be a fun time tonight

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
877 Game OLR

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Oh, I forgot to mention real quick

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
This kind of goes along with this story, but

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
It is apparently rumored

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Or, I don't know if it's confirmed or rumored

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
But, uh, they're saying that

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Modern Warfare 2 games are gonna be out

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Uh, by 2011

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Or, 3, not Modern Warfare

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Uh, 3 Call of Duty

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Games will be out

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Good luck, guys

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Good luck. Well, these other games

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Might be out soon. It's more website

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Leaks. Remember earlier in the show we had a

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
News about Farmville and some apparent

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Websites that were being registered that gave away Farmville

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
On other platforms. Well, something similar is kinda

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Happening, but it has to do with some different games

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Like games that people actually play

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Here's the interesting thing

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
The URLs were registered for

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Bloodstonegame.com

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Was registered Wednesday, and of course

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Bloodstone is supposed to be the next Bond game

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
That's like the rumors that's coming out

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
But you know what also was registered?

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Goldeneyegame.com

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Hmm

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Could this be, I don't know

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Something where, you know, there was rumors before

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
There might be a Wii version of GoldenEye coming out

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Or something. Who knows?

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Uh, which is strange because I could've sworn

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
I said before, it's not fucking happening

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Shut up

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
But you know, where there's a will, there's a way

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Also, apparently a game that was discovered

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
DriverSanFranciscogame.com

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Was registered by

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Ubisoft

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Uh, it's by Ubisoft

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Yeah, I don't know

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Well, but didn't Atari

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Sell it off tonight? Yeah, that's right

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
So, there you go. That's too bad

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.com

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
And LaserHomeBattleground.com

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
What the hell is that? LaserHomeBattleground?

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Sounds like laser tag

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Where's LaserCatsBattleground.com?

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
That's the game

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
I would've given that top of the news

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Reporting. Oh, that's easy

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
You just put a cat stuffed animal

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
On top of the laser gun

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Alright

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Supposedly, Assassin's Creed is gonna have another

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Sequel in 2011 anyway, so maybe that's the

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Subtitle of the game, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Who knows?

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Brotherhood? Yeah

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.com

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Was just registered. Uh, sounds like

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Um, another

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
PSP game

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
That could be too, who knows? I'm going to the website right now

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
And a time's out. I guess you have to look up the registry

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Info. There's no forwarding

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Happening just yet

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Alright guys, this is part of the show

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Where we're gonna open up the Skype line and take your

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Or our username on Skype is

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. If you're gonna call us on Skype

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
That's great, the quality's really good on Skype

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
But we do encourage you to call

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Echo123 on Skype

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Or I think in the newer versions of Skype

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
You click a button that says test call

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Or something, and you can test your configuration

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
First, I really urge you to

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Do that, or I'm going to make fun of you

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
When your call stinks

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
OrangeLoungeRadio is the place to call on

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Skype. Whatever you want to talk about

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Tonight's show, go ahead

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Say your piece, have a voice

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
While we wait for calls

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Cause it takes about a minute for me to say something

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And the listeners actually hear it with the encoding and everything

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Yes, apparently

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
There is a new game coming out

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
From Bayer

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
I guess, it's called

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Knock Em Down's World's Fair

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
And apparently it's a device

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
That, or it comes with a device

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
That you use to check your blood glucose

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Level, and you can play the game that way

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
That's funny, that's one of the other Tiger Claw

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Stories from the Twitter, but I just

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
He sent so many, I had to pick and choose

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
One of you brought it up too

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
I thought I remembered hearing that this game was in development before

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Like I wanted to say some time ago

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I heard that there was a DS game in development

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
That was using like medical stuff

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Yeah, I can't imagine though that this would be too

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Popular, I mean it seems like a very

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Narrow market that they'd be, you know

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Well, yes, you're right

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
But, I mean for that market

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I think it could actually be really cool

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Cause you know there's a lot of tweens and teenagers

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
That get diagnosed with diabetes at a very

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Young age, and this could be an interesting

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Way to teach them kind of the management of that

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Cause you know you have to alter your diet, take your blood

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Glucose, know what it means, you know there's a lot

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
That goes with it, it's not just like, hey you have

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Diabetes, you know there's a lot of things

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
That go with it, so I actually

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Think, even though yeah you're right, it's a niche thing

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
It's kind of neat

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
It is

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
But I'm sure it will sell the particular products

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
You know, it's

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Monitors and stuff for what, $200

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
A pop, and then you have to buy test strips

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I mean I know your insurance usually

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Covers that stuff, but you still have some choices

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
On what brands you get

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
It's still pretty crazy, I have

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
A number of friends who have to monitor

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Yeah, especially if you're

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
The type 1

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Yeah, there's different stages of it

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Sometimes you can be diabetic, but you don't actually

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Have to test anything, but you still

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Well you still have to watch it, or I guess you could slip

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Into one of the other types

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Well, you typically adult onset, I believe

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
That's type 2

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Yeah, my grandma had it

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
So, it was unfortunate

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
I don't know why

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
You know what, I upgraded the version of Skype

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
So I'm almost worried that the calls aren't coming through

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
So I'm just gonna make sure

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Well Bobby's call came through

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Yeah it's true, Bobby's call came through, so that should work

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
I'm just calling the 877 number to make sure everything's okay

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Where are you people?

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I know, it's kind of weird, we're not getting any calls tonight

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Usually it's flooded with people

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
I guess they're worried about the threats of sending people

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
To mantis.net, I don't know

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Well I've got some more last minute stories

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Alright, let's hear it

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
MacWarrior 4, there was that whole

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Kind of delay

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
They were gonna release the game free

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
To play over the web

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
And it was being held up by

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Microsoft, now it's finally been cleared

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
So there will be coming

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Coming soon, there will be a brand new

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Port of MacWarrior 4

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
That you'll be able to play

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
For free, over the internet, through a web browser

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Isn't that exciting?

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Mad Catz is apparently now gonna be making

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
All the principal peripherals

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
For Rock Band

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Basically that means

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
All the peripherals that come with

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Say Rock Band 3

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Or any future releases

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Going forth

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Will be made by Mad Catz

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
And not by EA or whoever the hell they had

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Making their peripherals

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
And yeah I know Mad Catz peripherals

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
At one time really suck

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
But to be honest I kind of like their

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Guitar at least

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I have the bass and

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
I dig that, it's pretty cool

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Does it wear out like

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
The fucking

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Rock Band, just regular guitar they have

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Guess what, we got a call

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Awesome

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Hi, you're on Orange Zon's radio, who's this?

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Hi, this is Amiga777

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Amiga777

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
I love the Amiga, what's up?

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Just testing the streams

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
To make sure that the calls

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Are going through for you

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
That's pretty much it

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
AOK works great

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Thanks

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Wait wait wait, you're not gonna

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
He just hung up

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Ah yes

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Just confirm me it's not your stream

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
We just don't want to talk to you

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
This is just a courtesy call

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Just checking

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
That's right, everything's fine guys

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
No worries, you're good

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Oh that's funny

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Oh right, whatever

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Here's someone that we haven't heard from

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
That's one of my favorite phone calls

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
I've ever got, just so you know

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Alright, here's someone we haven't heard from

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
In a while, actually two years

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
To be exact

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Surfer Girl is back with a new rumor

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Regarding the slim

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Xbox 360

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
She says it's gonna be unveiled at E3

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
They're gonna rebrand the Xbox 360

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
As well

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Apparently

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
The review will happen

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Some 360

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Natal bundle will happen at one of the

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Two Yes2

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Press conferences at this year's E3

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
What's more is the 360 will be

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Getting a subtle rebrand

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
With a new logo and black is the new

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Primary color for the console

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
They feel that the new system needs to be black

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Because a white Natal

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Wouldn't sit well against the typical

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Gloss black TV

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
The new system design is pretty neat

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
And Natal, let's just say

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
You're gonna be very surprised and very pleased

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
By one of the games being revealed

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
What is it?

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
And then of course, in bold

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
It says, might get shot

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Or MGS

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Perhaps a new Metal Gear Solid game

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Alright, let's go to the phones

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
We have another test call coming in

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Hey

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Hi

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Hello

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Hello

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Hey, DT, what's on your mind?

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Hi, you're here

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Turn down the speakers on the computer

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Because then you get all confused

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
So what's up? What's on your mind, buddy?

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Plug in the

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I know it's a monthly

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Plug in the WonderCon

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Article

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
That's right, WonderCon, you got to go to WonderCon

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
A couple weeks ago and you wrote a nice little article

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
About it that's on the website

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
That's cool, how did you

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
How did you enjoy things at WonderCon?

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Did you have a good time overall?

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Oh god, yeah

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
First stop was at a

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Capcom booth, they were showing

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Final Fight and Super Street Fighter 4

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
And Plus Planet 2, actually

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
You know, I actually read

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
The article, believe it or not

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
And I heard you scored a soundtrack

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
At the booth, what'd you get there?

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Actually, that was just posted online

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
What I got was a couple

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Yeah, no, you're right, I thought the

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Rockman 9 soundtrack

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Nice

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
I like how you call it Rockman 9

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
And not Mega Man 9, was it actually the Japanese

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Version?

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Yeah, it was

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
No, that's cool, very cool

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
It's interesting, though, that you were at

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
See, this kind of blows me away

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Even though I know it was a few weeks ago you went to

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
WonderCon at this point, so for some people

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
This does strike me as interesting

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Capcom had to know

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Happening when they did WonderCon

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
But yet, they didn't say anything

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
At what you would otherwise

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Think is a really freaking

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Logical place to announce a game like

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Marvel vs. Capcom 3

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
And yet, not a peep, right?

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I know

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
They talked about being at future

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Comic Cons and whatnot

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
With that

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I guess WonderCon just wasn't good enough, sad cry

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Upset

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
But hey, there's

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
BayCon coming up

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
I think is a big sci-fi nerdy con

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
I don't know if there will be a lot of video games of that

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
But I know I had some friends talking about that

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Memorial Day weekend, and of course, Fonome

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Memorial Day weekend is always a big con weekend

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
So there's a lot of that coming up

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Any cons in your future, otherwise?

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
I don't know

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Probably just trying to go to

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
WonderCon next year

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
I know my brother was excited about that

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
He's really big into comics

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
That's cool, you gotta go to Comic Con

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
I've heard that the one that happens in San Diego

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Is epic, I would love to go someday

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
But I just don't know if I'm gonna make it

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
That's weird

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
It wouldn't surprise me at all, with all the stars

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
And everything to go, I'll have to plan for 2011

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Or something

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Well, Darktotu, Darktotu, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Well

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Yeah, no, I know

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
I heard some

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
footage got stolen at the Super Street Fighter

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
4 launch event

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
I don't know if he talked about that

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
We didn't, what did you hear about this?

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
I vaguely remember seeing an article on this

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
What's up, what's going on?

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
I don't know, I guess someone stole a bunch of stuff

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
But the Super Street Fighter launch event

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Like, footage of

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
the different players and all of that

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
And a MacBook

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
So they want to know who the hell

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
But the game's like, I don't get what the

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
advantage would be to stealing something like that

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Like, the game is pretty much out now

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
They didn't steal anything regarding the game

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
They stole camera equipment

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
And SDI records

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
And a MacBook

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
It was that they wanted the computer equipment

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
It wasn't anything to do with what was on it

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
It was, uh, I am 8-bit

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Oh, that's stinky

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
How did a thief get into an event like that?

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
That's terrible

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Well, you see the people that play Street Fighter

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Oh, stop it! I play Street Fighter, you ass

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
But yeah, there are some shady people that play

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Street Fighter, just saying

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
But that dates back to 1992

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
So, well

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
There's shady people that play anything

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
That's very true

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Dark Tetsuya, thieves suck and they should be laughed at

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
And taunted

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
And made fun of

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
And that's why we're here

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, thanks so much for the phone call

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
We're gonna let you go to see if, you know, anyone else

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
by chance, you know, we want to free up the phone line

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
of those floods of calls that are coming in tonight

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Alright, you take care

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
And thanks for all you do for OLR, we appreciate it

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Take care

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Yeah, no problem

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
The fine Dark Tetsuya, who really tries to actually

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
put content on orangeontraded.com

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Nice guy

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Tigerclaw says they don't care about the equipment

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
All they care about is getting the footage

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Tigerclaw says they recorded footage of the event

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Yeah, they just want the footage back

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
That's just messed up

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Thieves suck

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Alright, what else you got, Loki?

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Anything else?

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Just some last minute stuff here

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
There's another little big

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Or, I guess, a little big planet

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
PSP download content pack

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
that's gonna be coming out called the Turbo Pack

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
And it's gonna feature some

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
new

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
stock car racing inspired tracks

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
and vehicles

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
And also they're gonna have

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I guess some construction based vehicles

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
as well that are gonna be available

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
such as forklifts, cranes, and cement mixers

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
So that's kinda neat

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Unbound Saga

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
which was kind of a comic-based

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
beat-em-up game that was on the

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
PSP is now making its way

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
to Xbox Live Arcade

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Kind of a little bit like Comic Zone, I guess

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
PSP one is kinda

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
alright, I guess

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
But that'll be coming out a little bit later on

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
this year

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Asia is getting

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
a limited edition Final Fantasy

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
13 controller

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
with the silkscreen of lightning on it

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I guess to go with your Final Fantasy

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
13 lightning

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
PS3. Why that wasn't

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
included with the PS3 is beyond

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
me, but whatever

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
I guess, you know, opportunity to sell it twice

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
And then

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Lastly

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
just a little bit of elaboration on a story

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
we had earlier talking about delays

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
from Nintendo, kind of as

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
I thought, different things

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
It's taken a little bit longer to get the

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
development for Metroid Other M done

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
because they're working with a third party company

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
on it

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
That's why it's been delayed to August 31st

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
And then of course Sin and Punishment

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Star Successor is just basically to fill the

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
space

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
because it was originally going to come out at the beginning of the month

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
And they did their excuses

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Well we just want you to have some more time to play

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Super Mario Galaxy 2

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
So, that is it

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Alright

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Well, I don't know what's up

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Something's in the water

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Come on people! Ron Sean, call us

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
No, I closed Skype

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
One last thing also, forgot

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
This might be the next Yaris

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Apparently, Audi is releasing

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
a free rhythm based driving game

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
for the iPhone

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Oh goody

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
No more to say there

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Well, I don't know

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
I guess, you know, it's okay

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Some weeks, you know, in all things considered

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
it was a bit of a slow news week

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
of sorts, you know, a lot of the stories we had

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
tonight weren't like huge things

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
I mean a lot of stories were confirmations of things that were spoiled

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
last week and you know

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
It really does, but where's the love?

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Where's the love?

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
I could use the extra time tonight to

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
take care of some things before work tomorrow

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
I'm sure we all could so

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
I think we're going to wrap it up, believe it or not

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
A little bit of a shorter show tonight, but that's okay

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Again, it just wasn't a huge

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
huge week for news

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
It was like a bunch of Capcom news

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
We already knew that

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Of course, you know, it's going to be like this for a few weeks

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
because E3 is on the horizon

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
so outside of your E3 leaks

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
May is going to be a bit of a slow month

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
If I'd known

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
we would have planned a game or something for tonight

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
So you know what that means next week

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
if it's a slow news week again, we're going to have a game

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
or something

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Or we might have an actual guest on the show

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
I know my friend Matt is dying to come back

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
He was here back when the show was still at my house

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
He's like, I really want to come back and hang with you guys

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
I'm like, okay

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I'm sure Alan will be here in the next couple of weeks

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
He's loving coming to the show

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
So we'll have him at some point

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
BlackWolfInChat says

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Okay, so let me get this straight

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Rama calls my show for the first time ever

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
but doesn't call OLR

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
It's a weird night

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
It's okay

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
No, I closed Skype, I'm sorry guys

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
The moment's passed

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
The opportunity has passed

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
That's okay

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
I won't take it personally

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
He's just going to have a big diva stop

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Send us some emails

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
and all that fun stuff

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
And see, I would love to

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
just do a game

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
pull a game out of the hat, but we don't have anything

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
That's okay guys, no seriously

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
I could stand to wrap up the show by 9 o'clock

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
and then go home and take care of some other stuff

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
So, we are out you guys

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Let's go around

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
You know what you could do? What?

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
You should play the clip of Julian again

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Because you know what? No phone call that we're even

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
going to get could possibly match

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
how disgustingly cute Julian is

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
in that clip

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
He's a cute kid

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
I'm telling you, this is going to be all the rage

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
at youtube.com slash users slash dark

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
sakura OLR

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Dalek

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
What does a Dalek say?

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Is that my night?

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
That's the cutest, and look at that expression

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I know

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
One more time

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
One more time

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
What does a Dalek say?

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Exterminate

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
I like how he even says it a little bit robotically

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Exterminate

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
I love it

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
I wish I had grown up on a show like Doctor Who

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
That's kind of awesome

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Did you? No, I didn't really, not me

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Keep in mind

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
I was watching PBS a lot

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
when I was a kid

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
So Doctor Who came on PBS

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
So I started with like

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
fourth Doctor

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Sarah Jane era

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
So she's always

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
going to be my favorite because she's who I remember

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
May Satsuma in chat says

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Julian is smarter than DS Master

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
confirms

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Julian is smarter than most

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
adults I know

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I know, I'm serious

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
He's a smart kid

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
And he's a bit of a smart ass too

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Just like his parents A little bit sassy?

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
A lot Okay, very cool

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Alright

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
I didn't have Doctor Who to

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
grow up on though, you know what shows I watched growing up?

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
I watched Sesame Street

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Of course, I mean god, who didn't watch Sesame Street?

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
And 321 Contact

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
And then later on

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
as I was getting older, Square One TV

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Remember that show?

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
They need a show like that again

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
That's the one they used to play in a homeroom I think

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
They didn't play it at school

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
No, we had Channel One

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Or something

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
They would pipe this

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
like pay cable show

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
into our homerooms every morning

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
and try to edumacate us

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
I just did my homework

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
The only show I remember watching

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
on like an early morning

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
TV thing at school was Kids Court

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
with Paul Provenza

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
I remember Kids Court

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Remember that?

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
It was like Nick TV in the classroom or something like that

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Good stuff

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Alright, reminiscing is fun

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
but alas, the show must come to an end

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off tonight

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Your final thought? I found Happy Tape

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
My final thought is

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
I see some yarn over on Dark Sakura's

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
bookshelf and it makes me think

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
I wish I was a cat so I could just play with that yarn

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
all day Yarn, yarn, yarn

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
The scarf of yours I still need to finish

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
You need to see the scarf I got yesterday

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
at a thrift store for a dollar

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Yes, awesome

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
I was like a flaming gay fourth doctor

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I really was

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
It was very short

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Because it was for a twelve year old girl

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
and I bought it at a thrift store to wear to Rocky

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Anyhow, but that's neither here nor there

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Loki, your final thought tonight

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
I want to play more Just Cause 2

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Hopefully this time the textures actually show up

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
so that I can see what I'm doing

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
because it's kind of hard when the whole map is see-through

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
or most of the map is see-through

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Thank you guys so much

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
for downloading our show

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
listening to it live, supporting

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
independent podcasting, you guys are

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
awesome, I know I say that week after week

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
but if you think about it

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
next week, tomorrow, next week

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
is episode 365

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
of our show, that's one

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
for every day of the year

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
and that's a whole long time

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
and we just wouldn't have made it this long

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
if it wasn't for the support of you guys

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
just being here every week and saying

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
you guys are funny

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
so thank you guys so much

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
and all we ask if you enjoyed Orange Lawns Radio

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
just tell a friend

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
or two or five about Orange Lawns Radio

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
and what we do here

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
and just help us spread the word, that's really all we ask

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
because many of you have shared your tweets and Facebook messages

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
about how you've done that and trust me

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
we really do appreciate it because

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
we don't have money to take out advertising

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
or whatever

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
we have other podcasts, so hey, if you want a guest spot

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
just email one of us

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
I know I've gone on other shows

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
and I don't think Dark Soccer would be opposed to it

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
she had another show for a little while

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
and I don't think Loki's going to mind

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
it will be back, by the way, I did ask about it

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
there's just

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
graduations coming up

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
and someone being very busy

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
I've never asked to be on our show

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I'm not surprised

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Loki, you were on All Games Interactive

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
a couple times, I think

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
I had to do a toss over

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
there you go, alright

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
actually, and I do also want to

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
say, given that

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
graduation thing, by the way

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
it's Mar and Marvel

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
our own Tiara

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
congratulations in two months

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
absolutely, what's the major?

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
graphic design

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
good stuff, well hopefully she'll be back on the show

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
hopefully she'll be taking a graduation gift trip out here

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
but Loki, poor Loki

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
who has not been on any show

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
somebody needs to email Loki and get him on a show

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
that's alright

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
doesn't matter

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
alright, let's see

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Amiga777 in chat says

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
I nominate Tommy T to be a guest

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
I'm assuming he means Tommy Tallarico

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
we had him on a couple of years ago

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
it was right before the Video Games Live

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
CD came out, it was about two years ago

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
he's fun, we'd have him back on the show

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
maybe after E3 and all that

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
that was a fun show, a fun concert though

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
oh yeah, they're doing it again

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
they're doing it again at E3 this year

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
I wish they'd do it in San Francisco again, hopefully we'll see

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
alright, that's it, we're done, we're wrapping up

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
we're out of here, thank you guys so much

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
again for your support, and what do you say we do it all again next week

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
sound good?

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
and no, it is not Episode Live 365

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
I've got nothing going on next week, sure

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
we don't speak about that

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
are they even around still?

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
I believe so

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
but they don't look any different, they did about four years ago when we left

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:47.000
alright, that's it, we're done, bye, good night

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
see you next week
