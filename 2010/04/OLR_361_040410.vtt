00:00.000 --> 00:20.820
Tonight, April 4th, 2010, a theft occurs at PAX East, Linux gets taken away on the PS3,

00:20.820 --> 00:31.800
and Nintendo puts the snack down on the end of the whole fans were waiting for.

00:31.800 --> 00:37.600
Hello my friends, and welcome to episode number 361 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game

00:37.600 --> 00:40.840
talk show where every gamer has a voice, except the host.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.820
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my lovely

00:44.820 --> 00:48.400
co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
Uh...

00:49.400 --> 00:50.400
I know, right?

00:50.400 --> 00:52.060
We'll get into that later.

00:52.060 --> 00:53.060
It's not a good night.

00:53.060 --> 00:54.720
Seriously, we should just phone tonight's episode in.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.720
I don't...

00:55.720 --> 00:56.720
What the hell are we doing?

00:56.720 --> 00:59.580
We should just, like, throw the show roll in the toilet and just do whatever.

00:59.580 --> 01:03.160
If this is the first show you've ever listened to of Orange Lounge Radio, please go back

01:03.160 --> 01:08.280
in the iTunes archives and select another, because it's just gonna be one of those nights

01:08.280 --> 01:09.280
that I can already tell.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.280
This...

01:10.280 --> 01:11.280
We had the fuck show already.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.320
This is the fuck it show.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.320
Not here tonight.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.480
Sometimes that's some of our best work, though, so we'll see what happens.

01:16.480 --> 01:17.600
Not here tonight.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.000
Tagmaster Loki, sadly, is not here.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.020
I think he's got a holiday dinner thing going on, which is strange because the wife is Jewish,

01:24.020 --> 01:25.020
but whatever.

01:25.020 --> 01:26.020
There's a dinner in the...

01:26.020 --> 01:27.020
But it may be his family.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.020
No, I know.

01:28.020 --> 01:29.020
It is.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.020
I'm pretty sure it is his family.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.020
So, you know.

01:31.020 --> 01:32.020
And he...

01:32.020 --> 01:33.020
The man deserves a night off once in a while.

01:33.020 --> 01:34.620
I wonder if Nellie's observing Passover.

01:34.620 --> 01:35.620
I have no idea.

01:35.620 --> 01:36.620
If...

01:36.620 --> 01:37.620
Well, no, she can't be, because...

01:37.620 --> 01:38.620
Yeah, never mind.

01:38.620 --> 01:39.620
Well, anyhow.

01:39.620 --> 01:43.040
Uh, and one thing I should say about Loki, you know, I'm sure he wanted to tell you all

01:43.040 --> 01:45.360
this on the show, but he posted it on Twitter.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.360
And when I say...

01:46.360 --> 01:47.540
You post it on Twitter?

01:47.540 --> 01:50.640
CNN can report on it, so therefore it's fair game, right?

01:50.640 --> 01:51.780
Nellie is pregnant again.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.440
So congratulations to Loki.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.520
The pictures were kind of scary, because I could see bones.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.240
That's what babies look like when they're in the...

01:58.240 --> 02:00.240
And they're growing inside of you.

02:00.240 --> 02:05.160
And just so you guys know, not only is Nellie pregnant, she's, what, about 20 weeks?

02:05.160 --> 02:08.880
I mean, they waited, I mean, understandably, if you don't know what happened before...

02:08.880 --> 02:11.160
They waited until it was a viable pregnancy.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.160
Yes.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.640
They wanted to wait this time to say anything.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.760
So she's about 20 weeks along at this point.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.280
I think they already know it's a boy, and just, it's one this time, it's not 20.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.280
I saw the pee-pee.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.280
So, what's that?

02:21.280 --> 02:23.000
They pointed to the pee-pee on the ultrasound.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Did they?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Oh, okay, yeah.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
And the hand in the hand.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Nellie would do that.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
That's a very Nellie thing to do.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, no, they usually do that.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
The doctors will...

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Look at my kid's penis!

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Woo!

02:32.000 --> 02:34.360
The doctors will, like, usually point stuff out on the ultrasound.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.360
Okay.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.360
All right.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.360
I'm gonna make you some dinner.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.360
No, but in all seriousness...

02:38.360 --> 02:39.360
Like a good woman should.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.360
Bite my ass.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.360
Oh, I just did that.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.520
Actually, if you want something more disgusting, bite my sinus cavity.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.640
All right.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.640
So great.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.400
I get to monologue with the listeners for a little while.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.400
This should be fun.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.400
No, I'll do my gaming week.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.760
I can hear you from the other room, Rob.

02:51.760 --> 02:52.760
I know you can.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.760
And you'll hear...

02:53.760 --> 02:54.760
We'll be good.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.320
I'll talk to the chatters tonight.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.880
I'll talk to the chatters.

02:57.880 --> 02:58.880
Hi, chatters.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.800
So, yes, Loki is, chat.orangehonstrader.com, by the way, if you want to join our chat room.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.040
There's no Loki here tonight because he's having a nice family dinner, and obviously

03:07.040 --> 03:09.640
they have reasons to celebrate, so good for them.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.840
He'll be back next week.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.520
So it's just, right now, it's just you and me, folks.

03:14.520 --> 03:18.400
You and the guys in the chat room, chat.orangehontrader.com, and we'll be opening up the Skype line a

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
little later on.

03:19.400 --> 03:24.280
Now, here's the other part that's, I guess, just hilarious of what's going on right now,

03:24.280 --> 03:25.660
is that I am sick.

03:25.660 --> 03:28.120
You can probably tell my voice sounds a little bit out of it.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.760
And Dark Sakura, you can hear her blowing her nose like in China.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.560
Like, go download Bobby's show from this week.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.440
It sounded like an earthquake going on back there.

03:36.440 --> 03:41.480
So dark as she's screaming at me from the kitchen.

03:41.480 --> 03:45.360
So dark, it's like, this is like the Dark Sakura and Sky are married edition.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.360
What is going on here?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.320
You're yelling at me from the kitchen.

03:48.320 --> 03:53.640
You're cooking me dinner.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.720
This is the- Rob is officially my gay husband.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.280
This is definitely an April Fool's edition.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.040
Rob is my complimentary spouse.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.040
Fist bump.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.840
You just fist bumped me.

04:02.840 --> 04:08.080
Rob is, Rob can be my complimentary spouse at Sam's Club.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.240
Can I talk about fist bumping for a minute?

04:10.240 --> 04:11.480
Okay, PAX East.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.720
Ain't no one want to shake my hand at PAX East for whatever reason.

04:14.720 --> 04:15.760
Now, there's a couple of people.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.640
But I noticed the big thing to do is fist bumping.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.680
Like that's how people say hello now is they fist bump.

04:21.680 --> 04:26.280
And like, surely that's a sign I'm getting old is that I don't want to fist bump.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.580
Like back in my day, we shake hands.

04:28.580 --> 04:30.360
Like I'm not going to- But not when you're sick.

04:30.360 --> 04:35.040
Well, A, I wasn't sick during the con and B, I already had swine flu in October.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.240
So I'm not going to have it again.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.240
I did too.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.240
Oops.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.200
I'm not cooking dinner.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.880
I'll let everyone know what Rob is having.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.360
It's the same thing I'm having.

04:45.360 --> 04:51.640
It's an Ezekiel 4-9 tortilla, so there's no gluten and no yeast in it.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.400
With some garlic hummus.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.400
All this healthy crap.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.560
Baby spinach.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.760
Fresh baby spinach.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.440
The wife's making me eat healthy tonight.

04:58.440 --> 04:59.440
And yogurt cheese.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.760
Because I will say more about this later.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.120
Everyone knows I have digestion problems.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.880
I think I figured out what's causing it.

05:05.880 --> 05:06.880
All right.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.280
That's right.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.280
And Rob in the chat room says, I got it from the bean bag and shook your hand.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.280
That's true.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.640
No, it was just some people were fist bumping.

05:13.640 --> 05:24.400
Like I don't- I met a blogger who blogs for a site that's commercial and they get paid

05:24.400 --> 05:25.400
for it.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.760
And if I told you the site, you'd all know what it is.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.260
And she wanted to fist bump.

05:30.260 --> 05:32.920
And I was like, oh, okay, is that how we do it back East?

05:32.920 --> 05:35.760
But she was actually from California.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.480
So I didn't, I didn't get it, but I guess maybe it was a virus thing.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.480
I don't know.

05:39.480 --> 05:40.480
I guess.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.480
It was just weird.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.480
It was weird.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.480
All right.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.480
I wasn't used to that whole fist bump thing.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.320
I thought that's what like bros did when they were drunk.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.320
I don't know.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.320
All right.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.320
Anyhow.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.320
Uh, where the hell was I?

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
I was sick.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.680
Dark soccer is sick.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
We're all sick.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.680
Loki's out.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.680
Nellie's pregnant.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.880
There's earthquakes going on in California right now and somewhere there will be video

05:58.880 --> 05:59.880
games involved too.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.880
No, seriously.

06:00.880 --> 06:01.880
There's, there were earthquakes.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.520
There were two of them in California today.

06:03.520 --> 06:09.800
There was a, an earthquake in Baja, Mexico that apparently was felt San Diego, LA, like

06:09.800 --> 06:11.340
all the way to Phoenix.

06:11.340 --> 06:14.160
So just the whole Southwest is shaken.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.960
But thank God it sounds like not a lot of people are hurt.

06:16.960 --> 06:21.160
We heard from the resident Mexican actdeft on the Twitter again, I'm getting my news

06:21.160 --> 06:22.160
from Twitter.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.680
What's the world coming to actdeft apparently is okay.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.920
So I know if he's okay, then it can't be too terrible.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.000
So hopefully everybody is okay.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.500
I know they build a lot of the structures down there to, I mean, it's LA we're talking

06:33.500 --> 06:34.500
about.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.340
So there's a lot of structural integrity down there.

06:36.340 --> 06:37.680
So hopefully everybody's okay.

06:37.680 --> 06:42.960
What I didn't know at the same time, apparently nine minutes later, an aftershock of some

06:42.960 --> 06:45.520
sort hits in NorCal.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.700
Now I'm on the road and I don't know if you know this, but if you're sitting in a car,

06:49.700 --> 06:52.000
you can't feel an earthquake while you're driving.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.560
So if an earthquake happened, I didn't feel it, but it was also only like a 4.1 earthquake

06:57.560 --> 06:58.560
anyway.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.120
So, you know, and you can't even feel it if it's like 3.5.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.960
So I wouldn't have, you know, I wouldn't have really felt it anyway, but the scary part

07:05.960 --> 07:08.920
is I was sitting on the Bay Bridge right when these earthquakes were happening.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.640
And I know this because my sister who is in Long Beach texted me and said, earthquake

07:12.640 --> 07:13.640
lol.

07:13.640 --> 07:18.760
So, thank gosh, I didn't like fall off the bridge if that earthquake had been too much

07:18.760 --> 07:19.760
stronger.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.760
So there you go.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.040
All right.

07:24.040 --> 07:27.040
Some folks in our chat room are chatting about the earthquake.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.760
Fernando, can you hear the drums Fernando?

07:29.760 --> 07:34.720
And our chat room says, I felt the earthquake in San Diego, it was fun, meow.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.480
Amesatsuma says, the earthquake turned my bed into a water bed.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.200
Ray Ananami says, I was sitting, I didn't feel anything.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.680
Well, it was only a 4.1, you may not have felt anything.

07:43.680 --> 07:47.080
Okay, apparently, it's the earthquake show.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.560
It's the freaky crap show tonight.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.120
I don't know what the hell's going on tonight.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.800
We're just like avoiding the topic of games.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.480
All right, we can talk about games.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.480
Let's get into the show.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.320
Let's start it off as we always do with a little bit of how was your gaming week.

07:57.320 --> 08:02.600
And this is dark Sakura is still in the kitchen, but she's bringing ooh, yay, vitamin water.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.600
Thank you.

08:03.600 --> 08:08.000
Now my, when my throat is parched, I will be able to quench it.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.320
Here we go.

08:09.320 --> 08:13.680
So my gaming week, I went to PAX East and hopefully you heard the lovely show that we

08:13.680 --> 08:14.680
did last week.

08:14.680 --> 08:15.680
It's only aired live so far.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.600
It did not because I've been sick.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.080
I didn't get the MP3 posted.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.080
So I apologize.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.560
That'll be posted to OrangeLawnTreaty.com and some of our like Facebook and all that

08:24.560 --> 08:25.560
stuff later this week.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.680
But if you didn't hear the pack show, it was a lot of fun.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.720
Quite a few listeners, uh, met up with me there and it was really just cool to meet

08:31.720 --> 08:37.320
everybody and you see some of the, no, it wasn't, it wasn't that silly, but you know,

08:37.320 --> 08:38.320
we had a good time.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.320
We had a good discussion.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.320
It was fun.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.560
Um, you were a miss dark Sakura as was Loki.

08:41.560 --> 08:42.560
It was a bummer.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.920
You guys couldn't make it show itself.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.960
I don't know if I really actually ended up playing a lot of video games because I didn't

08:46.960 --> 08:49.160
want to wait in line for an hour.

08:49.160 --> 08:54.500
I will say what video games I did play classic gaming arcade, that big famous arcade they

08:54.500 --> 08:59.040
have out there in the east coast fun, fun spot.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.040
That's it.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.360
Fun spot brought some of their arcade machines two packs east.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.080
So I played donkey Kong three.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.080
Heck yeah.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.080
I played that.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.040
I took some pictures of pinball tables for dark Sakura on her Twitter and I played the

09:10.040 --> 09:13.520
Buck Rogers arcade machine that was actually one of the sit down cabinet and that machine

09:13.520 --> 09:14.960
kicked my ass.

09:14.960 --> 09:21.200
So I played some classic games, but as far as, um, uh, being able to take like, uh, I

09:21.200 --> 09:24.400
wasn't going to sit in an hour long line to play red dead redemption.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.720
And I did, it wasn't that excited about crack down to like, I just looked over someone's

09:27.720 --> 09:29.600
shoulder and I'm, I kind of got a feel for it.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.280
Like I didn't like have to play it myself.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
I was okay.

09:32.280 --> 09:39.160
So, you know, but I jump in the sequel, it was, it looked like I like jumping with rockets.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.600
Just people blast each other with rockets.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
But you know, I had a good time.

09:42.600 --> 09:46.840
I did get dark Sakura present, but unfortunately I neglected to bring it tonight.

09:46.840 --> 09:51.360
But um, it involves a certain card game that people were playing everywhere up and down

09:51.360 --> 09:53.520
the halls in the tabletop area.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.140
And I know it's one of the dark soccer is a fan of magic.

09:56.140 --> 10:01.880
I'm not telling, I'm not telling judgment, lol.

10:01.880 --> 10:06.880
I wish I would've been fun, but I, I had a, I had a, um, I had a good time at packs except

10:06.880 --> 10:07.960
for the omega thon.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.180
Can we talk about the omega thon?

10:09.180 --> 10:13.100
Cause that happened after the pack show.

10:13.100 --> 10:17.120
I'm already starting to get sick Sunday and my friends that I traveled with, my dear friends

10:17.120 --> 10:20.300
say and Amanda, they wanted to wait in line for the omega thon, which I'm like, okay,

10:20.300 --> 10:22.680
I've never watched a final round of megathons.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.680
I'm cool.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.020
I'm like, okay, let's, let's do it.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.020
Let's sit in line.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.060
Let's wait for the final round of megathon.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.900
Let's watch the closing ceremony, see what happens.

10:29.900 --> 10:34.200
So final round of the omega thon supposed to start at five o'clock, right?

10:34.200 --> 10:39.040
Five 30 I noticed we're still sitting in line outside and we are cramped.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.680
We are herded like cattle.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.600
If there was a fire, we would have died.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.600
We would all died.

10:43.600 --> 10:48.480
I mean, it's just, we are in there like so tightly packed and apparently they, they posted

10:48.480 --> 10:52.880
to their Twitter, Oh, we're having problems with the final omega thon game, LOL.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.840
And I'm just sitting there thinking, open the goddamn theater and test behind the curtain.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
Let us in.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.400
I'm old and my bones can't take this standing around anymore.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.560
So finally like five 45 they let us in.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.880
We get in there, sit down, wait for things to start, which finally start around six and

11:08.880 --> 11:11.480
then they're like, it's the omega thon.

11:11.480 --> 11:15.120
And you know, and of course it's always this big mystery.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.100
What's the last omega thon thing going to be?

11:17.100 --> 11:18.100
What's the game going to be?

11:18.100 --> 11:19.100
Oh my gosh.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.860
Well, this, this year was a team theme.

11:21.860 --> 11:25.640
The whole omega thon all the way from start to finish was played in teams like little

11:25.640 --> 11:26.640
teams.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.440
They did the whole way from start to finish.

11:28.440 --> 11:32.800
And so it made sense that the last omega thon game was going to be a series of games.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.040
It was a relay race.

11:35.040 --> 11:39.040
So the first game, super Mario brothers collect 50 coins.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.960
Second game, rad racer, get 1500 points.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.440
Third game, Tetris, get 10 lines.

11:44.440 --> 11:48.200
At this point, I'm thinking to myself, I'm watching the Nintendo world championships

11:48.200 --> 11:50.560
about 20 years late.

11:50.560 --> 11:54.240
Actually that sounds like almost the exact order of a Nintendo world championship cartridge.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.700
It was, it was, it was for real fun.

11:57.700 --> 12:01.140
It might've been like some variation in the coin numbers and the lines, but essentially

12:01.140 --> 12:05.440
it was the fricking, um, uh, Nintendo world championships.

12:05.440 --> 12:10.480
But the fourth game they had said would be a co-op game and Ooh, ah, what does it end

12:10.480 --> 12:11.480
up being?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.280
It's Contra.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.960
That's right, eight bit Contra was the final game and they had to play all the way to kill

12:16.960 --> 12:21.880
the first boss, which apparently now when I say kill the first boss in Contra, what

12:21.880 --> 12:22.880
does that mean to you?

12:22.880 --> 12:25.960
How far would you have to play in the game to kill the first boss in Contra?

12:25.960 --> 12:34.600
To the, through the little tunnel part and through to the like the, the very end.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.720
It wasn't the, the little dinky guy sitting in front of the gate at the first stage.

12:37.720 --> 12:41.920
No, see, I took it to mean that I took it to mean stage one, the end of that's the first

12:41.920 --> 12:43.320
boss is the end of stage one, right?

12:43.320 --> 12:46.480
No, but it was all the way to the big orb thing that goes back and forth.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.540
That's really at the end of like stage two.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.280
So that's how far they had to play.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.560
Well, yippy, skippy, without cussing.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.520
No, they could cuss all they wanted.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.520
Good.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.720
Cause that game makes me cuss from the very beginning.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.560
But I guess they'd put the Konami code in so that it wouldn't be that hard.

13:00.560 --> 13:05.000
Well, and then here's the thing, the fucking competition broke twice.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.680
Like they started, the whole thing started with Mario brothers and the second player

13:08.680 --> 13:10.040
side like wouldn't answer.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.820
So they said they had to restart and then they got all the way to Contra and the thing

13:13.820 --> 13:17.040
froze or something and they had to restart the entire competition.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.780
And you know what really sucks?

13:18.780 --> 13:24.000
The team that was ahead the first time lost, wah, wah, wah.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
So yeah.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.180
And then they were like, thanks for coming to watch the megathon, PAX East was awesome.

13:29.180 --> 13:31.560
It was more awesome than PAX prime.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.000
See you next year, bitches.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.600
And that was it.

13:34.600 --> 13:40.600
And I'm sitting like, I stood in an hour and like 30 minute line for that, which I could

13:40.600 --> 13:42.680
have read about on the internet in five minutes.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
That's stinky.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
It was very unfortunate.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.380
I hear past omega-thons have been much better.

13:47.380 --> 13:51.240
That was a very unfortunate low light of PAX.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.840
So there you go.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.640
Anyhow, that was part of my gaming week was PAX.

13:55.640 --> 13:59.200
Otherwise actual games I've been playing during the week, uh, game room, I've been playing

13:59.200 --> 14:00.200
quite a bit of.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.680
Bobby and I have been having a little spar in Yars revenge.

14:02.680 --> 14:06.520
It's like an unsaid competition, but I swear I've played Yars revenge more than any other

14:06.520 --> 14:07.760
game this week.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.760
Game room.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.240
There's a lot I really like about it.

14:10.240 --> 14:15.040
I really, really like that when you do challenges, it saves replays of your friends and that

14:15.040 --> 14:18.920
you can issue challenges and have leaderboards and have these stupid little animations that

14:18.920 --> 14:21.460
your characters do when you win challenges.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.520
And I like that you have the medals that you earn and so forth.

14:24.520 --> 14:29.320
And you know, that despite the fact that tokens don't really get you anything but bonus demo

14:29.320 --> 14:32.040
plays, it's still kind of cool that there's that incentive.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.680
But there's a lot that I don't like about game room too.

14:34.680 --> 14:40.740
And one of them is that the servers never work, which is ridiculous when you're trying

14:40.740 --> 14:43.440
to like get a high score saved or something.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.080
You might have to be hitting the button over and over and sometimes I've, I've lost scores

14:47.080 --> 14:50.240
because the servers literally go up and down and up and down and up and down.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.760
Like it is just atrocious.

14:52.760 --> 14:57.320
So I don't know what is going on with game room, but there's a good game room in there

14:57.320 --> 14:59.020
somewhere.

14:59.020 --> 15:01.640
It's just, you know, they've got a lot of kinks to work out.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.760
Honestly, my, my gut tells me as much as I, there's a lot I do like about game room, they

15:05.760 --> 15:07.320
shouldn't have released it when they did.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.480
They should have waited until things were more stable.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.480
Maybe they had no idea how popular it was going to be.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.280
I don't know, but I think they should have waited until like June.

15:15.280 --> 15:20.320
By the way, pro tip, I find I do better when I play on games for Windows with an Xbox Live

15:20.320 --> 15:24.320
controller or with an Xbox 360 controller than I do on regular Xbox.

15:24.320 --> 15:28.880
And I think part of the reason is that you're sitting right there in front of the monitor,

15:28.880 --> 15:31.000
just like an old school arcade cabinet.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.400
You're not sitting several feet away from your TV.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.640
And I think it does help the precision, especially on a lot of those old games, especially on

15:36.640 --> 15:41.320
things like asteroid deluxe where your bullets are like tiny, tiny, it kind of helps to be

15:41.320 --> 15:44.960
sitting right in front of the monitor as much as my mother would hate that.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.280
So there you go.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.040
Spyro in our chat room says game room is free.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.040
That is true.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.600
The game room engine itself is free and you can get like a good, like, I don't know, like

15:51.600 --> 15:56.040
50 gamers score just for downloading it and putting up decorations in your room.

15:56.040 --> 16:01.680
But you will have to pay at least like $3 to enjoy a game or $5 if you want them to

16:01.680 --> 16:04.100
be multi-platform, which is how I've been buying all my games.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.760
But I do go back and forth between Windows and 360.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.760
And some people might say $5, Rob, you're crazy.

16:09.760 --> 16:14.800
But well, I mean, I paid $5 for Frogger and Joust on the 360 when it first came out.

16:14.800 --> 16:19.020
And I've honestly played Yars' Revenge more than any other game this week.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.020
But I did play some other stuff.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.720
On the plane, I played a Final Fantasy Tactics A2 on the DS.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.080
I borrowed that game.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.080
It's cool.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.080
It's awesome.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.080
Like the way that was set up.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.600
Didn't realize it was part of the Final Fantasy XII canon, but that was kind of nice to play

16:31.600 --> 16:32.600
that.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.840
Had a little bit of fun with that.

16:33.840 --> 16:38.480
And honestly, that's, besides Warcraft and some of the other just little things here

16:38.480 --> 16:42.000
and there, that's really about it for my gaming week.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.840
DarkSakra, oh she who keeps blowing her nose and sinuses over there, how is your gaming

16:46.840 --> 16:47.840
week going?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.000
I just played some Star Trek Online.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.960
I've been taking advantage of my spring break to not be at my computer or not be in front

16:54.960 --> 16:55.960
of a TV.

16:55.960 --> 17:03.840
I just tried to rest a lot, you know, because I've been so busy with everything and then

17:03.840 --> 17:10.000
I was gonna actually make a good start on Final Fantasy II today.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.160
And then the allergy monster smacked me in the face, so basically every time I haven't

17:13.160 --> 17:15.660
been working on something here, I've been asleep.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.400
So I've been playing Dream.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.080
I've been playing Benadryl the game.

17:21.080 --> 17:26.120
It's where you take Benadryl and see if it'll either make you high or pass out.

17:26.120 --> 17:30.160
In my case it was pass out and that's what's happening again because I took another Benadryl.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.240
Great, so you took drugs that are gonna make you drowsy during the show.

17:33.240 --> 17:38.880
I took drugs so that I could breathe and then Dan gave me a Vix inhaler thing and I love

17:38.880 --> 17:39.880
those things.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.600
It's a tube you stick up your nose and snort.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.000
It looks like a tampon applicator, honestly, from where I'm sitting.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.200
It looks like a tampon.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.200
It does.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.640
It looks like you're shoving a tampon in your nose and pushing a button.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.640
That's disgusting.

17:49.640 --> 17:50.640
Don't do that.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.640
I just stuck it in my nose.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.640
Thank God it's radio.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.160
This is where all of you in chat are very thankful.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.160
I have a camera, Rob.

17:57.160 --> 18:04.640
All right, anyhow, where else was I with this, talking about webcams and all that stuff?

18:04.640 --> 18:11.520
Oh, I did want to say this about Rocky last night as I went to Rocky and, well, A, Alan

18:11.520 --> 18:16.080
was playing a crap ton of Peggle which I thought was cute because it made me think of you.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.040
That's one time I thought of you last night and then the other time, are you gonna put

18:19.040 --> 18:23.080
that on the OLR blog, I dare you.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.180
Dark Soccer never likes pictures of herself to get up on the internet and I dare her to

18:26.180 --> 18:27.680
put the tampon in her nose on the internet.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.520
I have a reason to look like shit.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.520
Are you putting that on the internet?

18:31.520 --> 18:32.520
Why not?

18:32.520 --> 18:33.520
Oh, I'm happy.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.520
All right.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.920
Dark Soccer with a tampon in her nose.

18:35.920 --> 18:40.300
Yes, as Mae Satsuma in chat says, it's nosepon.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.720
It's going up on the internet right now, orangehontrader.com.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.620
Click refresh a million times.

18:45.620 --> 18:49.980
I then also thought of you because I was playing the criminologist last night at Rocky and

18:49.980 --> 18:53.000
I was going through the bag and there's two wigs in there, one gray and one black.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.760
And when I pulled out the black wig, I went, this looks like a Tribble.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.260
And I was like, oh, that makes me think of my friend Jamie because she plays Star Trek

19:00.260 --> 19:02.080
online and she always tells the story about the Tribbles.

19:02.080 --> 19:06.200
Did you know you can get the Tribbles in your inventory and they multiply?

19:06.200 --> 19:10.280
They only multiply if you have food because they eat your food.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.280
I'm sorry.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
Yes, that's right.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.800
The picture should be up now.

19:13.800 --> 19:19.360
If I see this on verydemotivational.com, I will kill you.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.520
Don't tell them what website to post it to.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.520
At least you're not John McCain.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.800
Did you hear about that?

19:24.800 --> 19:25.880
What the fuck happened this time?

19:25.880 --> 19:27.280
I don't pay attention to that loser.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.560
No, this is funny.

19:28.560 --> 19:35.300
John McCain posted a picture of himself on the Twit pic or whatever, you know, and I'm

19:35.300 --> 19:36.480
not starting a political thing.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.640
I just think this is funny.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.320
If it had been Obama, it would have been funny too.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.880
Was he like playing with his nibbles or something?

19:40.880 --> 19:41.880
No, no, no.

19:41.880 --> 19:42.880
He was.

19:42.880 --> 19:43.880
It was really funny.

19:43.880 --> 19:48.280
No, he posted a picture just on his iPhone like, you know, because, you know, John McCain

19:48.280 --> 19:49.760
is really old, right?

19:49.760 --> 19:53.360
So the joke is he's probably not hip with technology, but he's showing, hey, I can take

19:53.360 --> 19:55.420
a picture of myself with my iPhone.

19:55.420 --> 20:01.080
So he did that and somebody took the picture and posted it to guyswithiphones.com, which

20:01.080 --> 20:05.800
if you've never been to that site, most of you probably don't want to go because it's

20:05.800 --> 20:07.640
kind of a gay porn website.

20:07.640 --> 20:12.120
Most of the guys that take pictures on that site have their wangs hanging out and, you

20:12.120 --> 20:16.160
know, they're balls and that's what the site is, okay?

20:16.160 --> 20:17.160
Don't ask me how I know.

20:17.160 --> 20:22.480
I read about, I read about it on Priz Hilton, okay, shut up.

20:22.480 --> 20:26.760
But somebody posted a picture, that picture of John McCain on that website.

20:26.760 --> 20:31.360
So you go to guyswithiphone.com and it's like penis, penis, balls, balls, wang, wang, butt,

20:31.360 --> 20:36.360
but John McCain.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.360
It was funny.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.360
All right.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.360
Anyhow.

20:39.360 --> 20:45.120
Hey, how about some housekeeping and then maybe we will actually talk about some video

20:45.120 --> 20:46.200
games tonight.

20:46.200 --> 20:52.000
It's going to be a short show tonight, kids, apologies, but if you can't tell why, I don't

20:52.000 --> 20:55.260
know what show you're listening to, but it will be a bit of a short show tonight, meaning

20:55.260 --> 20:58.180
it's not part A, part B, it's just one giant part tonight.

20:58.180 --> 21:00.440
So we're going to try and wrap up the show by eight o'clock.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.440
We will still take your calls.

21:01.440 --> 21:04.280
We'll take your Twitter topics, mailbag, all that stuff.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.280
We're not going to neglect it.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.280
Just a few less stories tonight so we can get out of here.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.400
I'm reading one email.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.400
There's one email.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
I'm going to read one.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.400
One email.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.480
Tiger call on our chat room says, what's next?

21:15.480 --> 21:16.760
McCain gets on chat roulette.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.160
Oh God.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.880
Talk about the cesspool of the internet.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.880
Chat roulette.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.520
I thought that was 2chan or 4chan.

21:25.520 --> 21:30.120
There is no word to describe that, but like chat roulette, there's some really funny YouTube's

21:30.120 --> 21:36.520
that come of chat roulette and my favorite is the guy that plays piano improv to the

21:36.520 --> 21:37.660
people on chat roulette.

21:37.660 --> 21:38.660
You've got to look this up.

21:38.660 --> 21:39.660
What's his name?

21:39.660 --> 21:40.660
Murk.

21:40.660 --> 21:41.660
Murk hot.

21:41.660 --> 21:42.660
Murk hot is his name.

21:42.660 --> 21:43.660
Something like that.

21:43.660 --> 21:47.320
I'm sure somebody in chat will say it, but, um, he goes on chat roulette and just starts

21:47.320 --> 21:49.120
playing like random piano songs.

21:49.120 --> 21:54.320
Like, Hey bro, in the red shirt, sitting there looking mean, you know, he just, it's funny.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.320
Trust me.

21:55.320 --> 21:56.320
It's piano improv.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.320
It's hilarious.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.780
Everybody thought he was Ben Folds, which made Ben Folds actually do it at a concert

22:00.780 --> 22:01.780
later on.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.280
It was funny.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.240
Hey, gaming news.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.920
We're a video game podcast.

22:08.920 --> 22:16.760
Major Nelson starts off our game thing tonight and somebody hacked, hacked sword major Nelson's

22:16.760 --> 22:18.060
game card.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.060
You know, major Nelson.

22:19.060 --> 22:20.060
He's famous.

22:20.060 --> 22:23.000
And you know, if you ever on the three 60 and you download the X-Box minute, hi, I'm

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
major Nelson.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.120
I'm at PAX East.

22:26.120 --> 22:29.180
You know, that's, and that's exactly what he sounds like to, he always goes out to the

22:29.180 --> 22:33.820
different events and he's kind of like, he's, he's the mouth for X-Box three 60, but that's,

22:33.820 --> 22:34.820
that's a good thing.

22:34.820 --> 22:38.080
Major Nelson is kind of the mouth for the three 60 Reggie fees.

22:38.080 --> 22:42.000
Amay is kind of the mouth, even though he's also the CEO, he's kind of the mouth for Nintendo.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.600
You kind of associate, you know, your, we press conference with Reggie fees, Amay.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.640
And then Sony, I don't know, Sony, Sony doesn't really have a mouth.

22:50.640 --> 22:57.560
I mean, I guess there's that one girl who's on the, the, um, um, core, but I can't even

22:57.560 --> 22:58.560
think of her name.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.900
Like that tells you what a mouthpiece she is.

23:00.900 --> 23:06.240
So major Nelson is kind of like the spokesman, if you will, for a three 60, but his, uh,

23:06.240 --> 23:10.620
his, uh, gamer card was hacked and it happened around the time packs was going on.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.140
So they picked a good time to do it, honestly.

23:13.140 --> 23:19.300
But what's weird is that like, I don't understand why you would like hack somebody's thing because

23:19.300 --> 23:25.440
they hacked his name to say, I'm a faggot, like ha ha funny.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.320
Like you're in the third grade.

23:27.320 --> 23:36.040
And then, uh, I don't know, they, they made the, the, the text say any account, $100 PayPal,

23:36.040 --> 23:39.940
I guess, meaning that you could pay these people a hundred dollars and they'll hack

23:39.940 --> 23:46.760
any account because you know, if they can get major Nelson, they can get your neighbor

23:46.760 --> 23:50.600
or your college friend that you're mad at or whatever as well.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.580
Well, somebody took a responsibility for it.

23:53.580 --> 23:56.960
I'm not even going to say who it was cause they're, they're trash and I'm not going to

23:56.960 --> 24:00.000
promote them here on the show, but somebody took responsibility for it and they even did

24:00.000 --> 24:03.240
a YouTube video, blah, blah, blah.

24:03.240 --> 24:07.680
So obviously Microsoft fix this, but this just begs the question, why, why would you

24:07.680 --> 24:09.400
hack someone's gamer card?

24:09.400 --> 24:11.200
What is to gain from that?

24:11.200 --> 24:12.200
It's EP'ing Rob.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.200
Really?

24:13.200 --> 24:16.480
I mean, at least like when you hack a wow account, like, you know, in my house.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.360
It's a famous target.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.880
So it's kind of like when the celebrity Twitters get hacked and like, you know, hi, I hacked

24:22.880 --> 24:26.620
Britney Spears, you know, I have a huge vagina and things like, it's funny to tweet as Britney

24:26.620 --> 24:28.800
Spears and say sick things.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.560
I don't, I still don't understand.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.720
Like there's no, I don't know.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.520
It just seems odd.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.520
Like a gamer card.

24:35.520 --> 24:40.680
Why don't you just hack major Nelson.com like then you could get people to go to your trash

24:40.680 --> 24:42.840
website like automatically with a four.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.100
Not that I'm saying you should do that cause you shouldn't, but I just, I don't understand

24:46.100 --> 24:50.580
the purpose of hacking someone's gamer card to say, I'm a faggot nonetheless.

24:50.580 --> 24:54.800
You know, like that's just stupid.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.800
It is stupid.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.120
I know what Rob, what you're doing right now talking about it.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.400
That's exactly why they do it.

25:00.400 --> 25:04.400
No, I know, which is why I didn't say the name of the site that took responsibility

25:04.400 --> 25:05.400
for it.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.640
But I just think it's just weird to me.

25:07.640 --> 25:12.020
Like I think it does need to be talked about, like why would people hack gamer cards or

25:12.020 --> 25:14.120
what's next?

25:14.120 --> 25:17.780
This is so watch out.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.480
Don't make people too mad because they might send these guys a hundred dollars and your

25:20.480 --> 25:25.640
gamer card will be hacked next and everybody will think that, you know, you're a whatever

25:25.640 --> 25:28.800
sixth grade word they want to put in there to describe you.

25:28.800 --> 25:29.800
So be careful.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.680
Maybe they need authenticators on Xbox live.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.320
Is that's what's going to come next authenticators?

25:34.320 --> 25:35.320
Who knows?

25:35.320 --> 25:36.320
Who knows?

25:36.320 --> 25:40.640
You know, um, you know, uh, Kristin got hacked on wow.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.640
I had read about that.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.640
A lot of people are getting hacked on.

25:42.640 --> 25:43.640
Wow.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.640
It happened.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.760
Like if you don't have an authenticator, you are going to get hacked.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.880
It's just a matter of time.

25:46.880 --> 25:52.040
Like do not think you are immune to this.

25:52.040 --> 25:57.400
Like I got hacked on wow and I am not stupid with stuff I downloaded.

25:57.400 --> 26:01.880
I don't click banners on things that, you know, aren't legit and all this other stuff.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.920
Like I got hacked and I think I know what happened.

26:04.920 --> 26:08.140
I think I logged in on my ex's computer and he was stupid.

26:08.140 --> 26:10.000
So I think that's what happened.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
You know what, Rob?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
What?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I can't get hacked.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Why?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
My account's disabled.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Well, yeah, you can't get hacked.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
I ain't paying for that.

26:17.000 --> 26:23.000
But actually I've heard of them like re-enabling accounts and going back in.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
So you gotta be careful.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.240
Well, you have an authenticator.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.240
You're fine.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.240
Yeah.

26:27.240 --> 26:30.520
But I think I had a friend who his account was dormant for like six months and they re-enabled

26:30.520 --> 26:37.280
it and oh man, they do, they do this dirty, dirty stuff just to get in there and mine

26:37.280 --> 26:40.640
millions of ore and sell it to people.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.640
Here's the thing.

26:41.640 --> 26:45.000
When you buy gold online, you are supporting this.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.200
I blame you as much as I blame the hackers.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.440
When you buy gold online, you support all these accounts getting hacked.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.440
Knock it off.

26:51.440 --> 26:55.680
You know, if I remember right in Star Trek Online, we actually do have a report if ever

26:55.680 --> 26:58.400
we see anything happening right away.

26:58.400 --> 27:04.120
Like it's set up in the mail and set up on the heads up display, which I think is smart.

27:04.120 --> 27:08.920
You need to have some, I don't remember Blizzard had anything like that, but I liked what Ion

27:08.920 --> 27:09.920
used to do.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.280
They used to have these very public executions in on the ion server.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.680
They would have like public executions of spammers.

27:15.680 --> 27:16.680
It was amazing.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.000
I have to watch them.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
That's what we needed.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Wow.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.200
We need, this will be the nice thing.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.880
OMG spoiler alert coming categories of spoiler, plug your ears if you don't want it.

27:24.880 --> 27:25.880
Okay.

27:25.880 --> 27:29.440
When gross takes over the hoard, since he's like a nasty little man, he should just start

27:29.440 --> 27:30.820
executing the spammers.

27:30.820 --> 27:31.820
That's what I want to see.

27:31.820 --> 27:35.240
He apparently he's going to be executing everyone else, so he needs to execute the spammers.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.240
Okay.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.880
And spoiler safe to listen.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.960
Well, how about other stuff, Rob?

27:40.960 --> 27:41.960
Okay.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.760
I have to make, give a shout out to get games.

27:44.760 --> 27:50.960
Their ads are really funny and stylistically very good as a designer.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.960
I like it.

27:51.960 --> 27:52.960
All right.

27:52.960 --> 27:59.240
It says in Soviet Russia, games get you two sniffs up, but it looks like old, uh, political

27:59.240 --> 28:00.240
posters.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.240
Anyway.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.560
Um, two K sports.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.600
They like a move in Natal.

28:06.600 --> 28:14.160
Um, their marketing dude, Jason Argent said, um, that there are, that the sports games

28:14.160 --> 28:21.160
are a natural fit for motion control and was mentioning by name, uh, the two K, uh, major

28:21.160 --> 28:22.160
league baseball series.

28:22.160 --> 28:27.260
They didn't really give anything else up on that, but I think that they're pretty pleased

28:27.260 --> 28:29.880
with it and go and keep it going.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.880
So good for them.

28:31.880 --> 28:35.800
I don't know Rob, what do you think?

28:35.800 --> 28:40.360
I think I should be able to get that big orange bat that you recently dug up, apparently according

28:40.360 --> 28:45.880
to your Facebook and with Natal, I should be able to use that bat as I play two K games.

28:45.880 --> 28:49.280
You'd have to come over here to get it because I won't break anything at all doing that in

28:49.280 --> 28:50.280
my house.

28:50.280 --> 28:54.040
But the orange bat is awesome.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.840
There's signatures on that thing that I ain't seen in ages.

28:56.840 --> 29:01.060
Not that I think that they're, they're going to encourage people to use actual bats with

29:01.060 --> 29:02.060
these games.

29:02.060 --> 29:04.040
Like it'll just be used swinging your hand or something.

29:04.040 --> 29:07.600
I don't know, we're having the motion with it like a pretend bat, but that would be really

29:07.600 --> 29:13.320
funny is if you try to use a real bat and like that is just not smart for most houses

29:13.320 --> 29:15.080
because then the bat goes flying through the TV.

29:15.080 --> 29:19.580
I mean, you thought the we emotes were bad, but this seems like a natural progression.

29:19.580 --> 29:26.240
I mean, what, what smarter than, you know, if extra, extra gaming or exercise gaming

29:26.240 --> 29:31.120
is like the next big thing, what smarter thing to do than to incorporate that with established

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
franchises?

29:32.120 --> 29:35.320
You need a light saber.

29:35.320 --> 29:40.680
This brings a whole new level to rod caliber, Rob.

29:40.680 --> 29:46.200
I think though, I hope that what these games do is make this support optional and I think

29:46.200 --> 29:47.200
they will.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.560
I think they know that there's still a hardcore audience, especially when you're talking about

29:49.560 --> 29:52.920
2k and you know, who knows whatever EA Sports ends up doing.

29:52.920 --> 29:56.020
I think they still know there's a very hardcore audience that does not want to stand there

29:56.020 --> 30:00.880
and flail their arms everywhere to pretend, you know, what have you.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.120
I kind of like what they do.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.120
You know, it's weird.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.080
We don't talk about sports games a lot on this show, but I kind of like what they do

30:05.080 --> 30:10.560
with Madden is that on the Wii, they really make the Wii game kind of targeted as the

30:10.560 --> 30:12.480
easy type game, if you will.

30:12.480 --> 30:18.160
And then the 360 and the PS3 versions are for the hardcore.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.160
Although I don't know.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.160
I don't think they should do separate versions.

30:20.160 --> 30:23.640
It's just be one version with two different modes, but we'll see what they do.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.400
You all right over there.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.660
It's like death is on the show tonight.

30:27.660 --> 30:28.660
This is amazing.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.720
I don't even look like myself, Rob.

30:31.720 --> 30:38.520
I can't believe you put that picture on the website.

30:38.520 --> 30:39.520
Why not?

30:39.520 --> 30:40.520
I don't care anymore.

30:40.520 --> 30:41.520
No, it's fine.

30:41.520 --> 30:42.520
It's fine.

30:42.520 --> 30:43.520
Jamie's in don't give a shit mode.

30:43.520 --> 30:48.320
Please go to orangelaundry.com quickly before dark soccer realizes what a, what a, what

30:48.320 --> 30:49.320
she did.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.760
No, it's really a horrid picture.

30:51.760 --> 30:55.520
I don't think I've ever looked that bad in my life.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.020
You know what we need?

30:57.020 --> 30:59.840
We need like a blingy competition with that picture.

30:59.840 --> 31:04.720
A blingy, haven't you ever, well, you don't use MySpace.

31:04.720 --> 31:09.840
So blingy is the site that puts the glitter and the hearts and all that.

31:09.840 --> 31:13.020
Just MySpace trash all over a picture.

31:13.020 --> 31:17.720
So somebody needs to take your picture and blingy-fy it to make it pretty.

31:17.720 --> 31:23.360
This is the most horrible picture of you ever.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.360
What is wrong with this show tonight?

31:25.360 --> 31:30.400
Well, no, I, I came, I came home and I washed my face and I'm like, fuck it.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.400
I don't care how it looks tonight.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.720
And cause it's just you, it's just little old me.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.720
That's Rob.

31:37.720 --> 31:38.720
It's just me.

31:38.720 --> 31:39.720
I don't care.

31:39.720 --> 31:40.800
I love these Vicks and Halor things though.

31:40.800 --> 31:41.800
They're perfect.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.360
I, I might have to get one.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.360
I don't know.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.360
We'll see.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.560
Although I feel like I'm getting better.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.000
It's just last week was bad.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.880
I, I, you know, I teach for a living and I couldn't talk Wednesday and Thursday and that's

31:51.880 --> 31:53.440
bad for a teacher.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.480
Like that's, that's really bad.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.440
Toegak, by the way, is, is a blingy-fying your picture right now.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.440
I'm excited.

32:00.440 --> 32:06.560
Please do not really, or I'll never put another picture of me online again.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.840
Toegak, send it to me private message.

32:08.840 --> 32:09.840
Okay.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.840
Don't, don't post it publicly.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.960
All right.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.720
Anyhow, at least you're not a dirty thief, right?

32:17.720 --> 32:20.680
You can hack all these accounts and stuff, but at least you're not a dirty thief.

32:20.680 --> 32:25.440
Well, apparently at PAX East, there was a theft out on the show floor and I'm not talking

32:25.440 --> 32:27.260
about like somebody's purse getting stolen.

32:27.260 --> 32:31.120
Apparently Atomic Games had this game that they were showing breach.

32:31.120 --> 32:35.960
The code was actually stolen from the show floor.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.880
Now this whole thing ended up being stopped.

32:37.880 --> 32:42.360
Like, you know, the guy, I guess had a little USB dongle thing.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.540
He was trying to copy the code.

32:44.540 --> 32:45.720
Somebody spotted him.

32:45.720 --> 32:50.080
He ran out into the large crowd, but they caught him somehow and they found the code

32:50.080 --> 32:51.560
on his computer.

32:51.560 --> 32:56.020
And the suspect apparently did admit that he was stealing the code.

32:56.020 --> 32:58.840
So he's like, yeah, I'm stealing the code.

32:58.840 --> 33:02.000
And when he got caught, he said, no big deal.

33:02.000 --> 33:07.040
I really liked the game and I wanted to play it with my friends because that makes it okay.

33:07.040 --> 33:11.160
He stole about 14 megs of the code before somebody caught him.

33:11.160 --> 33:14.440
That's so messed up.

33:14.440 --> 33:18.000
By the way, the alleged thief, Justin D. May.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.360
Wilmington, Delaware is where he lives apparently and he's got a lovely little picture all over

33:22.360 --> 33:23.360
the internet now.

33:23.360 --> 33:28.000
His little mug shot hit all the gaming blogs.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.200
Let's see, he said, I got online using the ethernet cable hanging outside their booth

33:31.200 --> 33:32.660
because wifi wasn't working.

33:32.660 --> 33:35.800
They stopped me, checked my computer and saw the Xbox neighborhood application.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.040
Because that was on there, they accused me of stealing breach even though it's not on

33:39.040 --> 33:40.040
my computer.

33:40.040 --> 33:45.200
So that's what he's saying in his defense.

33:45.200 --> 33:49.400
Apparently though, the atomic staff is counter responding to this saying, he said several

33:49.400 --> 33:53.360
times he knew people and could give us bigger and more important people and he could name

33:53.360 --> 33:54.360
names.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.520
However, I have no idea if these people are on the show floor or just hackers at home.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.720
I would hate to think he got someone's full code and their title is going to be compromised

34:00.720 --> 34:01.720
due to this guy.

34:01.720 --> 34:02.720
I just need to make it clear.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.960
He didn't say anything specific.

34:04.960 --> 34:09.400
Boy, oh boy.

34:09.400 --> 34:14.320
Apparently this guy, oh my God, this guy apparently even spoke up at a panel earlier in the day

34:14.320 --> 34:20.280
about Xbox live enforcement and the thief wanted to get his gamer tag un-banned.

34:20.280 --> 34:25.240
Steven Toluus, I probably mispronounced that wrong, Toluus, I'm distracted by Jamie's nose

34:25.240 --> 34:26.240
blowing.

34:26.240 --> 34:30.480
Steven Toluus, the director of policy and enforcement for Xbox live actually asked the

34:30.480 --> 34:36.280
guy what he did and the hacker said he played Forza 3 before release and he said, well you

34:36.280 --> 34:38.840
shouldn't have done that.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.880
Now if you buy games early from a retailer that breaks street date, that doesn't get

34:42.880 --> 34:46.160
players banned, but illegal pre-release play does.

34:46.160 --> 34:49.640
Good gosh, what a mess.

34:49.640 --> 34:54.520
This is J100 Matt in our chatroom says, how stupid does this kid have to be to steal a

34:54.520 --> 34:56.760
game that had an ex-Marina at the booth?

34:56.760 --> 35:00.720
Don't steal shit, especially when there are 60,000 witnesses around.

35:00.720 --> 35:04.440
Don't steal shit to begin with, but really don't steal shit when there's like that many

35:04.440 --> 35:06.320
people around.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.600
Sometimes the best thefts happen in plain sight.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.240
This is dumb.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.200
You're a dummy.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.880
Well how about something else that's dumb?

35:14.880 --> 35:18.720
Although I kind of get it, but I still think it's a little on the stupid side.

35:18.720 --> 35:28.600
The 3.21 firmware update for PS3 removes the option to install other OS.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.520
So no more Linux.

35:31.520 --> 35:36.300
They're getting rid of that because of security concerns, they said.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.320
So they're just going to start taking features away from our PlayStation.

35:39.320 --> 35:42.540
They're just like, nope, you know what, you shouldn't have this feature anymore.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.480
You know what?

35:44.480 --> 35:46.380
Not smart of Sony to do.

35:46.380 --> 35:47.380
You know why?

35:47.380 --> 35:52.080
Because Sony is getting cocky with all this hacking scene thing.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.380
And I just point to the PSP.

35:54.380 --> 35:58.860
Every time Sony releases some patch, they say, it's unhackable, unwinnable, the hackers

35:58.860 --> 36:02.680
will never succeed, they will never hack the PSP, it is unhackable.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.720
Two days later, it's hacked.

36:04.720 --> 36:08.560
Well, I just want to say, if people want something badly enough, they'll find a way to make it

36:08.560 --> 36:09.920
happen.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.720
And so sure enough, they're going to shut off this because apparently there's some exploit

36:13.720 --> 36:18.400
now in the PS3 Linux, I'm surprised it took that long, but now they are taking it away

36:18.400 --> 36:23.000
from, one bad apple ruins the barrel, they're taking it away from everybody and saying,

36:23.000 --> 36:26.520
well this exploit is just undoable now.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.120
We took away Linux.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.480
So now you can't do this at all.

36:30.480 --> 36:37.660
Well, there is a hacker named George Hotz, who was an iPhone hacker, who apparently did

36:37.660 --> 36:41.040
crack the code on the PS3.

36:41.040 --> 36:46.140
And then that's what might have started this whole thing.

36:46.140 --> 36:51.460
But the point is, is that if people want the hack bad enough, there will be something that

36:51.460 --> 36:54.960
will reverse engineer the PS3 back to the old patch.

36:54.960 --> 36:58.160
I mean, they do it all the time with the PSP.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.160
I don't know.

36:59.160 --> 37:03.540
I think though, for the majority of people, for the common person, hardly anyone's going

37:03.540 --> 37:04.540
to notice this happen.

37:04.540 --> 37:09.240
I mean, come on, listeners, how many of you were really using this feature?

37:09.240 --> 37:11.840
And maybe there's going to be a couple of you that are like, me, me, me, me.

37:11.840 --> 37:16.800
Well, if that's you, then you're probably continuing to use your PS3 for its Linux features,

37:16.800 --> 37:20.480
and therefore you're not going to want to take your PS3 on PlayStation Network and get

37:20.480 --> 37:21.960
the update.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.060
Because that's the only way you're going to be forced to update is when you try to play

37:24.060 --> 37:30.120
a game online or if you try to buy a new game, you know, that eventually, you know, the firmware

37:30.120 --> 37:34.560
will be on the disks for that later game, Uncharted 3 or whatever game comes later that

37:34.560 --> 37:36.600
everybody has to have.

37:36.600 --> 37:41.400
Well, apparently, what, it's pretty, pretty big.

37:41.400 --> 37:48.160
I might just put this in the chat room, because the way this guy has done it, I actually could

37:48.160 --> 37:49.720
see why Sony would make some changes.

37:49.720 --> 37:53.360
Well, I'm sure, it's just a matter of time before he finds another, he'll find an exploit

37:53.360 --> 37:57.200
in a game or something to reverse the firmware back to something old that's on the PSP all

37:57.200 --> 37:58.460
the time.

37:58.460 --> 38:01.400
I'm sure if Loki were here, he'd say he'd already done it.

38:01.400 --> 38:07.880
I'm like, it's just, it's just, it's too bad that Sony felt the need to patch it out for

38:07.880 --> 38:11.840
everyone because this was found when this isn't going to stop it.

38:11.840 --> 38:12.840
That's my point.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.700
This is not going to stop the hacking.

38:15.700 --> 38:18.640
You know, it's going to make it more difficult, yeah, but it's not going to stop it.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.020
Those that really want to do it are still going to do it.

38:21.020 --> 38:24.040
So it's just kind of a bummer to those that were using Linux legitimately, but at the

38:24.040 --> 38:27.920
same time, I just can't think of a whole lots of reasons.

38:27.920 --> 38:32.440
I mean, yeah, the computer in there was kind of unique, but I think if you're, you harnessed

38:32.440 --> 38:36.000
its power for whatever, you're not really playing games with it and therefore you won't

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
be affected anyway.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.360
There's just going to be such a minority of users affected by this, but it still sucks

38:41.360 --> 38:42.360
for them.

38:42.360 --> 38:45.200
You should send those angry cards and letters to Sony.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.600
What I love about the patch that they did, didn't add a damn thing.

38:48.600 --> 38:49.640
It didn't add anything.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.600
There was no silver lining to this patch.

38:52.600 --> 38:57.640
It's just, yep, we're just taking this feature away later.

38:57.640 --> 39:01.560
ToaGak says, actually, they're having issues downgrading the PSP from recent firmware as

39:01.560 --> 39:02.560
well.

39:02.560 --> 39:03.560
It got, it's getting harder.

39:03.560 --> 39:06.520
It's not going to stop them.

39:06.520 --> 39:08.520
Won't stop them.

39:08.520 --> 39:14.560
Anyhow, moving on to other news regarding the Xbox and talking about game room.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.840
Uh, you know, I've been playing game room a little bit here and there.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.440
I like it overall.

39:19.440 --> 39:23.200
I think, um, they probably should have waited about three more months to release it for

39:23.200 --> 39:26.280
them to work out some of the bugs, but you know, whatever.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.760
It's it's okay.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.800
Um, it's, it's showing promise.

39:29.800 --> 39:30.800
Let's put it that way.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.200
It's showing promise.

39:32.200 --> 39:37.680
Um, well, game room, uh, launched and they have 30 games in the lineup right now.

39:37.680 --> 39:42.360
Um, however, you know, you might've heard when that they wanted to have a thousand games

39:42.360 --> 39:44.400
on the service at some point.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.720
And in order to do that, they're going to have to have weekly releases.

39:46.720 --> 39:52.000
Well, it came out this week that you're not going to see weekly releases until late April.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.800
So that would mean like, you know, the last week of April, basically.

39:55.800 --> 40:01.160
So, if you were hoping for more games, nope, not going to happen right away.

40:01.160 --> 40:05.080
You know, I'm looking forward to like Pitfall and Kaboom and some of the other, uh, Activision

40:05.080 --> 40:08.080
classics and who knows what other little arcade gems they might dig up.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.080
Burger time, anyone?

40:09.080 --> 40:13.000
Uh, but we're not going to start seeing those till late April.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.920
Um, interesting tidbit by the way, cause I don't think this came up on our show.

40:17.920 --> 40:22.800
I think I mentioned it on Bobby's show on the call, but I actually, um, was with a pal

40:22.800 --> 40:28.140
Segg, my friend Segg was playing game room on the show floor at Microsoft's booth.

40:28.140 --> 40:31.920
And what's really funny is that he actually got the blue screen of death on the game.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.320
And honestly it seemed like he, all he did was set the controller down on top of the

40:35.320 --> 40:38.520
computer and it just threw the whole damn thing off balance and it blew screen to death

40:38.520 --> 40:40.960
right in front of everybody.

40:40.960 --> 40:44.040
So we were playing game room on the show floor and before he managed to crash the thing,

40:44.040 --> 40:47.660
um, I asked the guy, I said, so they're going to be doing like weekly releases with this.

40:47.660 --> 40:50.920
I heard something like a thousand games, you know, keep in mind, I don't have a media badge

40:50.920 --> 40:51.920
on.

40:51.920 --> 40:52.920
I don't use media.

40:52.920 --> 40:53.920
So I'm just, you know, the everyday gamer.

40:53.920 --> 41:02.080
And the guy said to me, he said, well, well, I don't know if weekly releases is what they're

41:02.080 --> 41:06.320
going to end up doing, but they want to look at doing regular releases, but I don't know

41:06.320 --> 41:07.820
if it'll be weekly.

41:07.820 --> 41:10.040
So they're already starting to backtrack a little bit.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.760
Releases that eat their fiber.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.000
It will not be regular.

41:14.000 --> 41:19.120
No, it will be just sporadic and all over the place.

41:19.120 --> 41:22.040
Like a McDonald's inspired release.

41:22.040 --> 41:25.840
Well, how about other stuff?

41:25.840 --> 41:26.840
Yes.

41:26.840 --> 41:27.840
How about Miyamoto?

41:27.840 --> 41:29.360
I think being a little foolish.

41:29.360 --> 41:37.960
Um, it basically thinks that Nintendo has a responsibility to educate the larger audiences

41:37.960 --> 41:44.120
about the benefits of gaming that he thinks that most people are afraid of gaming technology

41:44.120 --> 41:49.040
that, you know, once they become accustomed to it, there's nothing to be afraid of.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.760
Not afraid at all.

41:50.760 --> 41:52.640
How about just people don't like games?

41:52.640 --> 41:56.520
Some of them just don't like video games.

41:56.520 --> 41:57.920
I think there's a little truth to that.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.720
I mean, like my parents don't like video games.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.840
Well, I don't know.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.680
My dad doesn't care, but he doesn't really play them.

42:05.680 --> 42:08.520
I think there are a lot of people that don't get games.

42:08.520 --> 42:15.080
I mean, going back to PAX a little bit, part of the whole, you know, people were very moved

42:15.080 --> 42:18.880
by Wil Wheaton's opening speech and all this stuff, which I get because it was a very rah

42:18.880 --> 42:19.960
rah rah.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.060
This is our culture.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.060
This is our time.

42:22.060 --> 42:23.200
This is your place.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.520
Nobody's going to judge you here.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.560
You can be a gamer here and nobody's going to care.

42:26.560 --> 42:27.560
Okay.

42:27.560 --> 42:33.960
Well, that says to me that even we as gamers recognize that not everybody gets gaming.

42:33.960 --> 42:34.960
You know what I mean?

42:34.960 --> 42:35.960
And yeah, don't get me wrong.

42:35.960 --> 42:36.960
I think it's ridiculous.

42:36.960 --> 42:40.460
I mean, games are no different than movies in my opinion.

42:40.460 --> 42:45.020
I mean, you know, interactive entertainment, it's interactive entertainment.

42:45.020 --> 42:48.740
There's you know, Nookie is interactive entertainment.

42:48.740 --> 42:50.520
So it just depends on what you like.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.920
I mean, I don't get people that hate on games, but I think we recognize there are people

42:53.920 --> 42:55.760
that just don't get it for whatever reason.

42:55.760 --> 42:58.600
Well, I don't, there's a lot of stuff I don't get.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.440
Like the hills.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.580
I heard the hills got canceled finally.

43:03.580 --> 43:05.680
It took like five years for this to happen.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.400
I don't get the hills like Heidi and Spencer.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.400
Why are they famous?

43:09.400 --> 43:10.400
Why?

43:10.400 --> 43:11.680
I don't get that.

43:11.680 --> 43:17.480
And some people don't get why Final Fantasy 13 is awesome.

43:17.480 --> 43:19.760
But there are people out there that just aren't going to get games.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.840
I mean, wasn't that Nintendo's whole little thing was that they were going to try and

43:23.840 --> 43:28.120
make games more accessible to everybody and they somewhat, I don't know.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.560
I think they somewhat succeeded.

43:29.560 --> 43:35.760
I mean, they sold tons of consoles and people are all about, you know, Wii Fit and Wii Sports

43:35.760 --> 43:40.160
and all these games that have seemed to cross over into the mainstream, you know.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.120
Now there is a quote from him I want to read.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.520
It has to do with Sony and Microsoft.

43:45.520 --> 43:50.440
We feel it's an honor that some form of entertainment style we created is now going to be taken

43:50.440 --> 43:57.040
for granted thanks to the attitude taken by other companies, meaning their adoption of

43:57.040 --> 43:58.040
motion control.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.040
Aha.

43:59.040 --> 44:02.360
So it's the kind of thing where it's like, well, everybody else seems to agree.

44:02.360 --> 44:05.840
Imitation is the best form of, yeah.

44:05.840 --> 44:08.880
Plus, you know, you're forgetting.

44:08.880 --> 44:15.300
Microsoft does an incredibly good job of stealing people's ideas and making them better.

44:15.300 --> 44:17.800
And I think that's what they're trying to do with this whole Natal thing.

44:17.800 --> 44:19.400
They're going to make it better.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.400
But we'll see.

44:20.400 --> 44:21.640
I mean, that's still debatable.

44:21.640 --> 44:27.120
You can't really argue that until the system or game or whatever you want to call it itself

44:27.120 --> 44:28.120
comes out.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.120
But we'll see.

44:29.120 --> 44:32.520
PlayStation Move, you know, some of the early feedback was pretty good that it's way more

44:32.520 --> 44:34.000
responsive than the Wii.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.800
That's just competition, my friends, competition.

44:37.800 --> 44:41.120
All these companies trying to one-up each other.

44:41.120 --> 44:44.740
Speaking of which, there are a lot of companies out there that are currently trying to get

44:44.740 --> 44:48.600
your dollar as far as selling their video games.

44:48.600 --> 44:52.000
And we'll start with Japan this week for the release dates.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.320
Some of the release dates.

44:53.320 --> 44:57.240
Not a lot of new games on the 360 in Japan this week, but a crap ton of price reductions.

44:57.240 --> 45:02.400
Death Smiles, Far Cry 2, Mass Effect, Ninja Blade, Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, Hawk,

45:02.400 --> 45:07.060
all getting price reductions this week.

45:07.060 --> 45:11.360
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, also just price reductions.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.360
No new games.

45:12.360 --> 45:16.160
Dead Blades and Tom Clancy's HAWK or Hux.

45:16.160 --> 45:18.120
Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.

45:18.120 --> 45:20.340
It's really kind of a dry week.

45:20.340 --> 45:24.440
PlayStation 2, Clover no Kuni no Alice is like the only new game I'm seeing there on

45:24.440 --> 45:25.960
the PlayStation 2.

45:25.960 --> 45:31.480
On the Nintendo DS, again, nothing really new this week.

45:31.480 --> 45:32.480
It's a slow week.

45:32.480 --> 45:33.480
I don't know.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.440
You'd think like there's a Dragon Warrior game or something coming out where everything's

45:35.440 --> 45:36.840
getting out of the way.

45:36.840 --> 45:39.920
On the PSP, Monochrome is coming out this week.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.360
I believe that's the sequel to EchoChrome.

45:42.360 --> 45:48.600
And then there is one other game coming out, Judae no Atelier, Grimnant no Rekonjutsu,

45:48.600 --> 45:58.580
Torawear no Morito from Gust, which is, well, it looks like there's this like, let's see.

45:58.580 --> 46:03.080
It's like a time traveling game and cute little slime looking characters and little teddy

46:03.080 --> 46:06.360
bears and cute stuff and chicks with enormous breasts.

46:06.360 --> 46:09.760
So you're very like anime infused game.

46:09.760 --> 46:14.320
It's a PSP remake apparently of an older game.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.320
So there you go.

46:15.320 --> 46:18.600
Well, I've got a couple of UK releases if you're ready.

46:18.600 --> 46:25.520
Just two, Blue Toad Murder Files Episodes 4, 5, and 6, and Lead and Gold Gangs of the

46:25.520 --> 46:27.160
Wild West.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.160
That's it.

46:28.160 --> 46:31.920
This used to be a slow week all over the world.

46:31.920 --> 46:32.920
I wonder what that is.

46:32.920 --> 46:35.920
Maybe just because it's not, you know, a very busy time of year, although isn't it like

46:35.920 --> 46:36.920
spring break?

46:36.920 --> 46:37.920
Well, I guess this last week was spring break.

46:37.920 --> 46:38.920
Yeah, last week was spring break.

46:38.920 --> 46:39.920
I don't know.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.960
It's a slow week in the US as well, which you have to look forward to this week in the

46:42.960 --> 46:43.960
US.

46:43.960 --> 46:49.760
Commandos complete on the PC, a Borderlands add-on pack coming to the 360 and the PC,

46:49.760 --> 46:52.080
a game called Again on the DS.

46:52.080 --> 46:54.300
It's an action game from Koi Entertainment.

46:54.300 --> 46:58.120
And then my personal favorite here of the week that's coming out, Squishy Tank on the

46:58.120 --> 46:59.120
Nintendo DS.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.880
And I love the cover.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.500
Of course, it's from Natsume.

47:02.500 --> 47:03.760
I love the cover art.

47:03.760 --> 47:05.320
It's like a puzzle game.

47:05.320 --> 47:09.320
And if you look at the cover art, it looks like, like, imagine a slime from the Dragon

47:09.320 --> 47:11.760
Quest series and somebody is poking it.

47:11.760 --> 47:16.740
And so it has the angry face because it's being poked, yet it is a tank.

47:16.740 --> 47:20.160
So there it is.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.520
Squishy Tank for 20 bucks.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.520
Squishy.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.840
It's a puzzle game.

47:24.840 --> 47:28.960
Looks like match up colored blocks and make tanks squishy.

47:28.960 --> 47:29.960
It's squishy.

47:29.960 --> 47:30.960
Squishy.

47:30.960 --> 47:33.960
Oh, we're ready to get into, I guess, the mailbag.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.920
We're at that part of the show where we're going to dive into the mailbag and read some

47:36.920 --> 47:37.920
of your emails here.

47:37.920 --> 47:39.160
I'm reading three.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.640
And Dark Soccer will try her best to not sniff through them all.

47:41.640 --> 47:45.040
Thank you everyone for keeping them short.

47:45.040 --> 47:47.120
By the way, if you want to send us emails, please do.

47:47.120 --> 47:48.820
Next week hopefully we'll be better.

47:48.820 --> 47:52.720
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place you send emails and Dark Soccer reads them

47:52.720 --> 47:55.480
like she's going to do right now while I munch on this tortilla.

47:55.480 --> 47:56.480
Hey, O.L.R.

47:56.480 --> 47:59.760
Oh, do you haven't eaten yet?

47:59.760 --> 48:00.760
I've been talking.

48:00.760 --> 48:01.760
I can't eat and talk.

48:01.760 --> 48:02.760
We'll fucking eat already.

48:02.760 --> 48:03.760
All right, you talk.

48:03.760 --> 48:04.760
We'll eat.

48:04.760 --> 48:05.760
Let me know how it is.

48:05.760 --> 48:06.760
Read some emails.

48:06.760 --> 48:07.760
Hey, O.L.R.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.160
I was listening to your podcast at work and noticed Rob wonder why Final Fight and Magic

48:10.160 --> 48:12.040
Sword are getting packaged together.

48:12.040 --> 48:16.800
The reason is simply that the developers of the company who are doing the port love Magic

48:16.800 --> 48:17.800
Sword.

48:17.800 --> 48:22.120
The only way they would have been able to get it released is to bundle it with another

48:22.120 --> 48:23.120
game.

48:23.120 --> 48:27.440
So can you, so you can think they're completely selfish acts as the reason you're getting

48:27.440 --> 48:28.440
Magic Sword.

48:28.440 --> 48:29.440
P. A.Z.H.P.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.440
P.S.

48:30.440 --> 48:34.920
When Rob asked Loki to be a lady.

48:34.920 --> 48:39.160
For some reason I had an image of Rob singing Loki be a lady to the tune of Luck be a Lady

48:39.160 --> 48:40.160
by Frank Sinatra.

48:40.160 --> 48:41.160
I did that.

48:41.160 --> 48:45.240
Loki be a lady tonight, Loki if you've been a lady to begin with, Loki be a lady.

48:45.240 --> 48:46.440
I really did that on the show.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.240
I told Loki to be a lady.

48:48.240 --> 48:52.040
Apparently I was drunk.

48:52.040 --> 48:53.040
Wink wink nudge nudge.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.800
Thanks for the email.

48:54.800 --> 48:57.920
There should be more random tangents and acts of love.

48:57.920 --> 49:00.240
I know there's guardian legend fans out there.

49:00.240 --> 49:03.120
Help me out.

49:03.120 --> 49:04.120
But thank you.

49:04.120 --> 49:06.960
I'm so excited about Magic Sword I could piddle.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.960
Okay.

49:08.960 --> 49:11.560
Next one.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.560
Good evening Orange Nails Radio and fellow listeners.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.880
This is Gditz writing in again.

49:15.880 --> 49:20.560
Seeing as it's my birthday today then that I am in the process of getting ready for a

49:20.560 --> 49:24.920
night out I realize I won't be able to attend the live show today which I regret as it is

49:24.920 --> 49:27.540
always something fun and enlightening.

49:27.540 --> 49:33.180
So I figured I'd write an email instead so that you guys, while I'm drinking myself into

49:33.180 --> 49:37.480
a coma, you guys and gal will have something to discuss about video games.

49:37.480 --> 49:41.640
Oh, cause, sorry Mendoza's stuffing up again.

49:41.640 --> 49:45.920
I remember myself when I was under the age of 18 and had no problem purchasing one of

49:45.920 --> 49:51.920
the worst slash best murder simulators of all time, Grand Theft Auto 3.

49:51.920 --> 49:56.120
I am not really shocked that I managed to pull it off but I am a bit dismayed that the

49:56.120 --> 49:57.520
retailers don't seem to care.

49:57.520 --> 50:02.120
So the question is, do you think it's too easy for children to acquire mature rated

50:02.120 --> 50:05.720
games or are the measures taken by retailers good enough?

50:05.720 --> 50:10.560
Sorry for any and all spelling errors and or grammatical mistakes and have a happy Easter

50:10.560 --> 50:11.560
everyone.

50:11.560 --> 50:15.180
Gditz the other Swede.

50:15.180 --> 50:18.560
Like I said before about hacking, if somebody wants something bad enough they'll find a

50:18.560 --> 50:20.560
way to make it happen.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.600
You know, there's always going to be loopholes.

50:22.600 --> 50:29.000
I just think that, yeah, there, there should be a degree of responsibility by, by, uh,

50:29.000 --> 50:31.080
by the stores to adhere to the rule.

50:31.080 --> 50:36.800
But ultimately if the kid gets the game that's on the parent, not on the store.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.360
I pretty much agree with Dark Soccer.

50:38.360 --> 50:41.600
I like totally like, you know, stores do the best they can.

50:41.600 --> 50:47.860
I think if stores are shown to not be following the rules, then actions should be taken accordingly.

50:47.860 --> 50:51.000
You know, they do the same thing with cigarettes and alcohol and all this stuff.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.160
But ultimately it's up to the parents.

50:53.160 --> 50:57.620
I mean, you don't know if somebody, somebody might have like an older brother who will

50:57.620 --> 51:01.400
go in and buy the game for them or, you know, like a friend who's older, a cousin, I don't

51:01.400 --> 51:02.400
know.

51:02.400 --> 51:03.400
That's kind of like the hookup.

51:03.400 --> 51:06.240
You know, there's nothing the stores can do about that.

51:06.240 --> 51:10.120
And if a kid wants an M rated game bad enough and finds that hookup, then they're going

51:10.120 --> 51:11.120
to do it.

51:11.120 --> 51:14.240
Unless the parents say, if I catch you playing that game, I'm going to fucking throw your

51:14.240 --> 51:16.280
Xbox in the trash.

51:16.280 --> 51:20.240
And that's something my parents would have said, you know, like that's what it's ultimately

51:20.240 --> 51:21.240
comes down to.

51:21.240 --> 51:23.680
I think my mom would have said, when'd you get this?

51:23.680 --> 51:29.360
No, my parents, my parents, I don't know, like, I don't know, mature rated games weren't

51:29.360 --> 51:32.640
such a problem back then because it was all like the 8-bit NES and the Super Nintendo.

51:32.640 --> 51:36.320
So my parents were kind of like, whatever, like they didn't really care about Mortal

51:36.320 --> 51:37.320
Combat and stuff.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.320
They thought it was stupid.

51:38.320 --> 51:41.540
Or my parents, I don't think they ever really watched me play in that stuff.

51:41.540 --> 51:46.280
And I think if they did, my mom would walk in and go, Rob, that is gross.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.400
What is that game that you're playing?

51:47.400 --> 51:48.400
That is gross.

51:48.400 --> 51:49.400
Rob.

51:49.400 --> 51:54.280
He just knocked the head off, Rob, what are you playing?

51:54.280 --> 51:55.280
That is gross.

51:55.280 --> 52:00.720
And that would be the extent of it, but I would have been 15 or 16 at the time.

52:00.720 --> 52:03.520
So it's like, you know, now I think I even use this as an excuse.

52:03.520 --> 52:08.120
It's no grosser than, you know, the movies that my mom watches, you know, Mortal Combat

52:08.120 --> 52:10.120
fatalities are funny.

52:10.120 --> 52:18.020
Um, last one, and he put a lot of information on here, but I'm not going to say it until

52:18.020 --> 52:24.440
I have this expressed permission to, Hey, OLR, just wanted to give you a quick update

52:24.440 --> 52:26.880
on the whole fiasco going on with game crazy.

52:26.880 --> 52:32.480
This is the guy who's the manager in Colorado, my store, along with four others in the Denver

52:32.480 --> 52:37.180
slash Pueblo area, the only two stores in Colorado remain, is now starting liquidation

52:37.180 --> 52:38.180
this Friday.

52:38.180 --> 52:44.120
Jamie, I really hope that Dan is still safe and if not, I guess we are all in this together.

52:44.120 --> 52:49.720
Wish me luck with everything that will be coming my and or our way.

52:49.720 --> 52:54.600
And to think I almost bought a 3DHG TV at Best Buy yesterday, but my little guardian

52:54.600 --> 52:55.840
angel was telling me not to.

52:55.840 --> 52:56.840
Now I know why.

52:56.840 --> 52:57.840
Frowny face.

52:57.840 --> 53:01.540
Please let me know what is going on in your neck of the woods.

53:01.540 --> 53:02.540
One good thing to pass on.

53:02.540 --> 53:05.640
A lot of my customers are now listening to your show and love it, so keep it up.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.120
Take care, dude.

53:07.120 --> 53:12.480
Well then I apologize to your customer base for tonight's show, but, um, I'm sorry to

53:12.480 --> 53:13.480
hear it, dude.

53:13.480 --> 53:14.480
Cool.

53:14.480 --> 53:17.040
Um, I, I, I hope it works out for the best.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.920
I mean, I hope you're able to find something somewhere else.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.720
I mean, those customers are going to have to go somewhere.

53:20.720 --> 53:25.960
So this is also dated from March 22nd, so we might've heard already.

53:25.960 --> 53:26.960
Dan dodged the bullet.

53:26.960 --> 53:27.960
Wow.

53:27.960 --> 53:28.960
Good for him.

53:28.960 --> 53:32.520
They closed down a bunch of other stores, but Dan's store was still a pretty well performing

53:32.520 --> 53:33.520
store.

53:33.520 --> 53:35.840
So he's like, we didn't get any inventory.

53:35.840 --> 53:40.240
We were running out and we were sad and we thought we were going to go and then we got

53:40.240 --> 53:42.120
a shipment.

53:42.120 --> 53:46.080
And then they said, yeah, so Dan's store is still around for a little bit.

53:46.080 --> 53:47.720
Dan is also awesome.

53:47.720 --> 53:52.640
And there's a thought that his might be one of the ones to survive chapter 11 if the company

53:52.640 --> 53:53.640
survives.

53:53.640 --> 53:58.880
He just said he was a little disappointed because he hates driving to Cameron Park.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.720
Oh yeah, it's far.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.400
I've never been there.

54:02.400 --> 54:05.440
It's it's it's snows and shit there, doesn't it?

54:05.440 --> 54:06.440
It's kind of far.

54:06.440 --> 54:12.080
So, um, manager dude, which I'm calling you until you say I can actually say it's you,

54:12.080 --> 54:16.640
I mean, you put a store number and everything, but I don't want to jump the gun.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.640
Yeah.

54:17.640 --> 54:18.640
Yeah.

54:18.640 --> 54:22.560
Um, I, I see right about the liquidation.

54:22.560 --> 54:29.880
Take your, I deployed it and I hope, oh my God, the show is so sorry.

54:29.880 --> 54:33.880
And I hope that that something works out well for you and thank you for, by the way, spreading

54:33.880 --> 54:36.760
us around like a disease.

54:36.760 --> 54:37.760
Like Rob.

54:37.760 --> 54:38.760
Appreciate it.

54:38.760 --> 54:39.760
Robin.

54:39.760 --> 54:40.760
You know what?

54:40.760 --> 54:44.640
Uh, it was the not on me.

54:44.640 --> 54:54.680
I suppose it was a, uh, Fana, may 2000 I think my first Fana, may when I did my Emmy cosplay.

54:54.680 --> 55:00.620
Apparently all, all the Bay area DDR players and everything were getting sick from an illness

55:00.620 --> 55:05.880
that was in theory started by a certain moderator at the time on DDR.

55:05.880 --> 55:06.880
Nice.

55:06.880 --> 55:09.520
So, and I thought, oh, I'm not going to get it.

55:09.520 --> 55:10.520
It's all over.

55:10.520 --> 55:11.520
I'm just gone.

55:11.520 --> 55:14.160
I came back home sick with double yikes.

55:14.160 --> 55:17.400
Sorry to hear it con con crap.

55:17.400 --> 55:24.840
Um, but no, and I did get your email on my personal email address and I've just been

55:24.840 --> 55:25.840
swamped.

55:25.840 --> 55:30.200
So by the way, I have heard that there are game stores out there and like little, um,

55:30.200 --> 55:33.640
computer places, little, but you know, like land centers and stuff that actually play

55:33.640 --> 55:36.120
this show at the center.

55:36.120 --> 55:37.120
And I think that's rad.

55:37.120 --> 55:38.480
Like, thank you guys so much.

55:38.480 --> 55:41.960
Like we really ought to tone down the swearing so that it would be okay for more places to

55:41.960 --> 55:42.960
play us.

55:42.960 --> 55:43.960
I said crap.

55:43.960 --> 55:44.960
I didn't say shit.

55:44.960 --> 55:49.360
Well, but we, oops, I bet we're a heck of a lot more interesting than those stupid tapes.

55:49.360 --> 55:53.120
They probably send them to play with all the like, you know, hi, I'm Jeff Keighley and

55:53.120 --> 55:55.760
let's see what games coming out next.

55:55.760 --> 56:00.200
You know, like that stuff probably gets really old to see on loop over and over again.

56:00.200 --> 56:05.080
I think, you know, podcasts are kind of fun, so we'll have to think about cleaning it up

56:05.080 --> 56:06.080
some day.

56:06.080 --> 56:07.080
We're verbal kitsch, Rob.

56:07.080 --> 56:13.800
We're verbal kitsch, but, um, but back to the subject at hand, dude, I feel really rotten

56:13.800 --> 56:14.800
for you.

56:14.800 --> 56:21.160
And, um, shoot, shoot me another email to my real email and I will respond to you.

56:21.160 --> 56:27.760
And I, if I'm just so sorry that you, that this crap is happening and I mean, a lot of

56:27.760 --> 56:32.820
it is their own fault for their marketing strategy, but I think that GameStop really

56:32.820 --> 56:35.000
started dominating the market.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.280
You might just want to send with your email though, some E-Perell as a salacious pop and

56:39.280 --> 56:43.120
chat says this episode needs to come with some Perell.

56:43.120 --> 56:47.560
Jamie's about to go flush her head in the toilet to get it to stop hurting.

56:47.560 --> 56:51.620
By the way, backing up to some earlier messages in chat room from when I was impersonating

56:51.620 --> 56:55.320
my mother, um, Amae Satsuma says Skye's parents were from Sesame Street.

56:55.320 --> 57:00.100
Yeah, apparently, uh, Tiger Claw said, uh, Rob was probably like, Hey mom, watch this.

57:00.100 --> 57:02.480
He does a fatality in the game and she just goes ballistic.

57:02.480 --> 57:04.240
Yeah, that's not too far from the truth.

57:04.240 --> 57:08.880
I would do stuff just to, just to, uh, ruffle her feathers like, Hey, look at this.

57:08.880 --> 57:12.640
Oh Rob, that is gross.

57:12.640 --> 57:13.640
Why do you do that?

57:13.640 --> 57:15.840
You suddenly reminded me of, go do your homework.

57:15.840 --> 57:19.120
You still, it's only reminded me of something that Becky's two year old did.

57:19.120 --> 57:20.120
What's that?

57:20.120 --> 57:27.560
He went up to, Julian went up to Becky and picked his nose and said, yummy.

57:27.560 --> 57:30.400
With the big grim on his face.

57:30.400 --> 57:34.200
Just I guess he actually, he, this two year old has mastered smart.

57:34.200 --> 57:46.080
Rob, he's a smart kid, but is like, and then he shook his head and goes, yucky, uh, SSJ

57:46.080 --> 57:50.080
100 Matt says, no, don't tone down the language there, but he's getting freaked out that we're

57:50.080 --> 57:51.080
suddenly going to go G rated.

57:51.080 --> 57:52.640
No, we're not going to tone down the language.

57:52.640 --> 57:57.000
It would be nice if I had the time or one of us had the time or somebody had the time

57:57.000 --> 58:01.160
that we could go through the episode and beep out obscenities and that way you could have

58:01.160 --> 58:04.960
like a G rated version, you know, safe for broadcast, but let's face it, we're all too

58:04.960 --> 58:05.960
lazy.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.840
It's not going to happen.

58:07.840 --> 58:09.520
I mean, Loki's on this program.

58:09.520 --> 58:12.000
I mean, there's just, it's not going to happen.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.520
Not going to happen.

58:13.520 --> 58:17.400
Hey, uh, by the way, if you want to send in some emails, you should do so mailbag at orange

58:17.400 --> 58:20.480
launch radio.com is the place to send them.

58:20.480 --> 58:25.360
Now's the part of the show where we show a little angst and anger and say, F you man,

58:25.360 --> 58:42.600
F you.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.200
I guess I'll start the F us tonight.

58:44.200 --> 58:45.200
Oh, do your back.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.200
Oh, hi.

58:46.200 --> 58:47.200
Dark Sakura stars off tonight.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.200
Thank you.

58:48.200 --> 58:58.480
Um, a few to my allergies and the Sacramento area for being rife with plant life.

58:58.480 --> 59:03.400
I hope it all burns except for me and my stuff and yours.

59:03.400 --> 59:05.700
I need to see your new house.

59:05.700 --> 59:06.700
It's quaint.

59:06.700 --> 59:08.120
Come over next.

59:08.120 --> 59:10.640
Oh no, you have other stuff next weekend.

59:10.640 --> 59:11.640
Come over soon.

59:11.640 --> 59:12.640
Let's have breakfast.

59:12.640 --> 59:13.640
It's fun.

59:13.640 --> 59:14.640
On Sunday.

59:14.640 --> 59:15.640
All right, we'll see.

59:15.640 --> 59:20.840
Um, F you to Paxi's plague by the only one that has it.

59:20.840 --> 59:28.400
I think I am F you Paxi's plague, but I would like to say non F you to these lovely triple

59:28.400 --> 59:32.720
chocolate M and M's the dark soccer just gave me the air purple and sparkly.

59:32.720 --> 59:33.720
I'm going to take pictures of them.

59:33.720 --> 59:35.880
It's the gayest food I think I've ever seen.

59:35.880 --> 59:36.880
Dude.

59:36.880 --> 59:37.880
That's what I said in the kitchen.

59:37.880 --> 59:42.880
Rob, I'm going to bring you some of the gayest food I've ever eaten.

59:42.880 --> 59:49.920
He's a very gay, uh, as a show 100 Matt in the chat, this is a good question and sure

59:49.920 --> 59:53.120
we'll let chatters derail the flow of the show tonight cause I don't care tonight.

59:53.120 --> 59:57.240
I mean this show is already fucked up as it is as a show 100 Matt says, serious question

59:57.240 --> 59:58.340
for you.

59:58.340 --> 01:00:03.880
What did your parents think of you guys playing DDR dance, dance revolution, the game that

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.800
brought this show together, dark soccer.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.800
What did your parents think?

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.800
I mean, well you would already, you weren't really living with your parents at that time.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.360
I was trying to explain it to my mom and she's like, what?

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.840
That was pretty much it with my parents too.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.680
I mean, I obviously I'd moved out of the house by then I was living on my own.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.920
Um, I would've been like, God, what year did we all start playing DDR?

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.820
I was two, it was 2000 for me.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.820
So I'd have been 21.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:28.400
You were just a young and 10 years ago I'd have been 21.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.400
So um, I was already out of the house by then.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.280
So my parents didn't really know, but they found out later on because when we started

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.440
doing the tournaments and stuff, like remember we ended up on the news sometimes and then

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.080
like, you know, our show ended up on the news and some of that stuff.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.640
And so my parents were kind of like, okay, well like I don't, I think they just don't

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.640
get it.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.340
I think my mom just kind of giggles.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.780
Like I think she kind of points and laughs at me, but doesn't like outright do that cause

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.780
I'm her kid.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.780
There's people who do that.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:59.440
You play that arrow game and my favorite thing is, so if you stomp that makes the arrows

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440
move.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.560
You know what?

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.560
You know what?

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.080
I'm just in that kind of mood tonight where I don't really care.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080
Do it.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.040
Let's, um, let's give somebody a call.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040
Let's find out.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.480
Cause I just, I need to know.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480
Hold on.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.200
Let's, uh, I just have to know the answer to this question.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200
This is a very good question.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.200
That's just you and her Matt's posing.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.200
Hello?

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.840
Hi mom.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840
It's Rob.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.840
Where are you?

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.400
I'm on, oh, she hung up on me.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.200
My mother just hung up on me.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.360
Maybe she doesn't want to be on the radio.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360
Let's try this again.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:46.080
Live radio, boys and girls.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.080
Is it working?

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.080
Stupid Skype.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:55.580
Let's try this one more time and I'm going to give up.

01:01:55.580 --> 01:02:00.520
We do tape live every Sunday night at all games radio www.allgames.com right after the

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.780
Bobby Black Wolf show, six o'clock Pacific.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:05.780
Thank you.

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.800
Uh, all games radio for letting us steal your bandwidth.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.200
Hey, Scott has a new show starting ApoDay TV.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.200
Check that out.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.200
We can call mine.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.200
Hello?

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200
Hi, it's Rob.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.200
Are you there?

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.200
I'm here.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.200
You keep hanging up on me.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.200
No, I didn't hang up on you.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.200
It's the internet.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.520
I'm on, we're on the radio.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.520
Is that okay?

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.520
I guess.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.520
All right.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.520
Say hi.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.520
What?

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.520
Say hi to the listeners, mommy.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.520
Hi, mommy.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.800
Hi, this is Jamie.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.160
I haven't seen you in a while, but hi.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.160
Okay.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160
So here's the thing.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.560
Tonight we're having a bad show because Loki is out.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.800
Both Jamie and I are sick.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.160
Like I got sick when I was in Boston.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.160
Did I tell you this?

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.160
I don't remember.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.160
I got really sick, so I've been sick.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.160
Don't worry.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.960
I've been going to work, but I'm sick.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.960
And so everybody at work is sick.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.960
Well hopefully not.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.640
And the person that goes around my office telling people to go home when they're sick

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.840
because I don't want to get sick.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.120
I just tell people I already had swine flu once, you ain't going to get it now.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.120
Okay.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.120
Here's the deal.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.120
We were taking questions from chatters and I thought the chatters had a good question

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:14.280
and the chatter wanted to know, what do you think about your son, that would be me, playing

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.960
Dance Dance Revolution?

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.800
Like did you, did you ever know about this Dance Dance Revolution game that I was playing?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800
Uh huh.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.600
And what did you think of it?

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.160
What did you think of it?

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.040
I thought it was good exercise.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.040
It was.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.040
It was good exercise.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.040
I was probably never in my thinning, or I was never thinner than I was when I played

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.040
that, huh?

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.040
Except when you had pancreatitis.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040
That's absolutely true.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040
What, um.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.520
Am I supposed to not like it or something because I don't have.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.520
No, no.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.520
I'll get.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.520
Well, let me ask you this.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:49.840
Were there ever video games that I played growing up that you didn't like?

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.280
That I didn't like?

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.280
Yeah.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:58.160
Only the, I didn't, I wasn't particularly fond of the, uh, very violent games.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.040
And why, why, why didn't you like that?

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:05.840
Did you think that I was gonna go out and do things and imitate what I saw in the games?

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.880
Well, it's just, I just don't think it's particularly good for children to be playing those kind

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.920
of games, war games and things like that.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.440
Did you ever like catch me playing a bad video game and you like grounded me?

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440
Cause I don't really remember.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440
No.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440
I just remember you.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.640
No, because you had pretty good taste.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.480
You didn't really like those violent games.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.480
Well now that's not true.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.920
See, I was really good at hiding it from you.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:31.920
Well maybe so.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.920
Maybe I just.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.920
Never tell your mother how sneaky and devious you were as a child.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920
Oh, she knows.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.700
She knows all about that stuff now cause it's funny.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:43.480
My sister and I will get together and exchange stories with my mother sitting right there.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.600
Okay.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.960
But the other thing, the other thing, do you remember a game called Mortal Combat that

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.520
I used to play?

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.680
Yeah I didn't like that one.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.680
Yeah.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.680
Wasn't it gross?

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.680
It was pretty gross.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.600
Cause I remember I was doing an impersonation earlier that you would come in the room and

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.680
you would say, Rob, what is that game?

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.120
That is a gross game.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.120
Turn off that game.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.120
It's gross.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.760
That, that, that you were a little older then too.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.760
You weren't real.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.200
I mean you were like 14 maybe.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.200
So it was okay.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.680
I was, I was, I was at the point where it was okay.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.680
You weren't real.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.000
So I'm, you know, I'm thinking, you know, five, six, seven, eight.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.240
I don't, I wouldn't think that would be appropriate for a child that age.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.240
Okay.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.320
Well I got one other question for you here.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.760
And um, that question would be, um, why don't you like video games?

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.520
Cause you don't really play games.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:37.260
What is, but you watch movies and you watch Oprah and American Idol.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:40.840
So what, why don't you like games?

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.160
It's a matter of taste I guess.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.480
And for one thing, I'm not that well coordinated.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.360
I'd probably fail at it, you know, because I think you've been doing it ever since you

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.360
were a little kid.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:57.480
So you're pretty well coordinated as far as, you know, you using the joystick and stuff.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.480
I'm not.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:03.640
So I'd rather be entertained rather than trying to entertain myself like that.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.640
All right.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.160
You're not interested in getting a Wii?

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:11.320
You don't want to do Wii bowling?

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.360
No, not really.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.360
All right.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.360
All right.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.440
Well, do you give me a Wii?

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440
You're going to give me a Wii?

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.520
You want, do you want a Wii?

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.160
Is that what you want for Christmas?

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.440
No, but you, you acted like you were trying to get me to say, Oh yeah, I'd love to have

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.040
a Wii so you could get me one.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040
You wouldn't use it.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.040
That's why I'm not going to get you one.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.040
You wouldn't use it.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.040
You're right.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.720
The first time I'd wear myself out and then I'd say never again.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.720
All right.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.720
Anything you want to say to the listeners of our fine radio program, uh, the, you know,

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720
five people?

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:49.440
Ask them why they don't have something better to do.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.440
Thank you for your love and support.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.440
Mom.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.440
I really appreciate it.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.760
Oh, I, you know, I love and support you, so.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:55.760
All right.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.760
Bye mommy.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.760
I love you.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.040
Happy Easter to you too.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.040
All right.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040
Bye.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040
Bye.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.040
My turn.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.320
You want to call your mother?

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.320
Is she up?

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320
It's not too late over there.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320
What time is it?

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.160
10, 15 on the east coast.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.360
My mom doesn't live on the east coast.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.360
She lives in central.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.360
Oh, central time.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360
So nine 15.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.360
I don't care.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.360
Wake her up.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.360
All right.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.360
Here you go.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.360
Punch in the number one.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.360
Mobile.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:24.360
Okay.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.680
Let's see.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.200
It's Easter with the family here on orange lounge radio.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.420
Oh, it did not like that number.

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:35.420
What did I know?

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:38.080
Mom's phone number acts wonky sometimes.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.080
Can you show it to me one more time here?

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.080
Yeah.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.080
Okay.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.080
Sick.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.080
The top one.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.080
Okay.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.800
Here we go.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.800
Here it goes.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.800
It's calling.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.800
Dark soccer.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.800
It's all you.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.800
Hey.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:14.880
Come on mom.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.880
She went to bed.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.880
You're in trouble.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.360
She, she's not sleeping.

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.360
She's out partying.

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.360
Let's leave her voicemail.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:26.520
Hi, this is Kathy.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.520
I'm sorry.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.520
I can't take your call right now.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.520
Please leave me a message.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.520
She's adorable.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:37.040
At the tone, please record your message.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.480
When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.760
Hi mommy.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.760
It's your spawn.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:50.720
Um, the female one, um, your voicemail is live on orange lounge radio.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.440
We were trying to call you because it was funny.

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.680
Um, but you would have been an internet celebrity, but you missed your chance.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.680
Sorry mom.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.920
We were going to ask you about video games.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.920
That's wrong.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.240
Terrible influence they had on your child, but you know, I guess call back, call back

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.520
this number.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.520
I don't think it'll work.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.200
It's it shows up as like one, two, three, four, five, text, text Jamie and we'll call

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.200
you back.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.200
Love you mom.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.200
Bye.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.200
Bye mom's voicemail.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.200
All right.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:19.520
Well, now we've successfully derailed the show three times over.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.520
That was a lot of fun.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.560
Hey, and we had a canine visitor.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.080
I know, and I'm not a big fan of big dogs, so that kind of scared the hell out of me,

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.080
but thank you.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.080
All right.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:32.400
All of a sudden I just turn around, there's a dog in my life.

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.400
True story.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:37.240
I was, did you know I was bit by a dog when I was five years old and I've had issues with

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240
them ever since.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.240
That's what you said.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.240
I know.

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.240
Just in case the listeners don't know.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.240
I do.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240
I'm not a fan of big dogs.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.120
Just, you know, Hey, how about video games?

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:58.280
I put up the picture, I think I put up the picture of the very gay M&M's.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.680
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.120
This game is only what a couple of years old, but we have some new news on it and it has

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:09.000
to do with the way it is selling and you might've heard not much, but apparently actually some

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.160
sales figures coming from February of 2010 apparently, and this is cumulatively up to

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:23.040
February of 2010 Chinatown Wars, the sales of that on the DS represents 50%, about 50%

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.920
of the sales of all M rated DS titles.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.720
So meaning that when you take the other M rated titles, dementia, the ward, resident

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:36.120
evil, deadly silence, touch the dead core, ultimate mortal combat, and all these games

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:41.580
and you add them all up, it doesn't match what Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars has sold.

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:45.540
And this is kind of interesting because Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, the sales overall

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.740
have tended to be considered a disappointment.

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.240
And they even came out and said, uh, you know, they, they were blaming it on piracy that

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.640
the commercial performance of Chinatown Wars has certainly suffered at the hands of piracy

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.960
was a earlier quote, um, about that.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.480
I think it's interesting because it just goes to show M rated games are not selling on the

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:09.180
DS, but at the same time, I kind of think, well, duh, most DS owners are kids.

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:14.820
Like really like, true story, I was at Outback last night, the table next to us, what does

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:18.880
the little kid have that's waiting for his little, little, little Joey, you know, what

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.880
is it called?

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.480
The young kangaroo menu, the Joey kid menu waiting for his little kid steak.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.120
He was playing a DS, probably Pokemon or something.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.440
The Pokemanses.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.760
I mean the DS is like most popular with kids like tweens, if you will.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.420
So of course the M rated games are not going to sell that well cause my mother would not

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.720
have bought me that game when I was growing up.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.920
So there you go.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.100
Uh, I don't know.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.800
So maybe they just need to make some better games.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.000
But honestly, I just don't think the DS is the platform for an M rated game.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
It's mostly kids.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
There you go.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Dark soccer.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
What's up next?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Some stuff.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.240
Um, Final Fantasy nine actually.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:06.560
Um, they are, um, they're planning on putting, um, Final Fantasy nine on PSN and then it

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:12.400
was confirmed by Yoichi Wada, um, that, um, it would join Final Fantasy seven and eight

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.760
on the PS3.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.760
So yay.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.760
All the VV you want.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.760
Well, why not?

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:23.840
It's free money, honestly, for putting a nostalgic game that everybody knows and loves back on

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.840
the PlayStation network.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.360
Although it was probably a Final Fantasy a lot of people skipped over.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.360
I don't think nine sold quite as well as the other ones.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.360
I didn't play that much of it.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.880
I actually, I played more of nine than I did of eight cause I actually liked nine.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.440
I actually got past the first disc on nine.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.520
I didn't beat it, but I went pretty far in it.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.520
It was good.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.400
It was a good game.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.080
It was, you know, that more traditional Final Fantasy as opposed to that, uh, cyberpunk

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080
kind of looking thing.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.760
And that was its big thing.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.160
So how about some Twitter topics?

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.920
I don't even know if we got Twitter topics tonight, but we're going to go ahead and take

01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:00.120
some Twitter topics now on our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:06.120
Although I'm trying to load the Twitter right now.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:12.080
Hopefully I'll be able to filter out all the tweets about Justin Bieber, who is still a

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.080
trending topic.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:17.240
And how much, how much is that swipe Twitter stupid?

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.240
Don't worry about it.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.680
You're better off not knowing.

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.440
Let's see.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:30.040
Oh, this story kind of hits close to home from a tiger clock.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:35.280
SEGA confirms closure of internal Iron Man and Golden Axe developer.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.680
Do you know where that SEGA office was located?

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.680
San Francisco.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.680
Oh yeah.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.680
I've driven by there.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.680
Yeah.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:45.680
A lot of us have.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.680
It's right there off I 80.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.680
You can't miss it.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.680
Yeah.

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.680
SEGA studio.

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.680
San Francisco has been closed.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.680
They were making the Iron Man movie tie in games.

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.680
Golden Axe beast rider.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.120
Um, unfortunately the rumors were going around and they closed it.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.320
That one hits very close to home.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:58.320
That's a bummer.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.760
I thought SEGA was having a resurgence in popularity with Bayonetta and, um, you know,

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.280
some of the, they got that game, they showed residents of fate.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.240
Was that what it was called at PAX East actually looked pretty rad.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.640
I got to say so SEGA is having a Renaissance, but I guess the Iron Man movie tie in games

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.960
are not exactly how to do it.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.120
They'd ever made it with good control.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.120
It might've been a different story.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.440
Uh, blue swim sends us some tweets saying, Hey, any thoughts on cave shooter death smiles

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:28.560
getting a special edition with a nice Xbox 360 space plate and an OST CD.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.240
And then he links us to an article on Kotaku that actually shows us what it looks like.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.640
You know, there are some, definitely some shmup fans that are going to be really excited

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:37.640
about this.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.640
And I think it's very cool.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.200
I mean, I don't know if it's something I would spend the extra money on, but I think it's

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.200
cool.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.840
Like it's cool that the games kind of come into the U S at all.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.560
You know, like we just talked about how I think it was getting a limited edition in

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:52.220
Japan, but I guess this whole, actually this giant collection is only like 50 bucks.

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.220
That's not bad.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:56.960
And again, can't say I'm a huge fan of it, so I don't know if I could justify spending

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:02.360
that kind of money, but I think it's cool that it's even coming out at all.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.360
So that's neat.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.760
Maybe a friend of mine will get it and I can check it out.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.760
I don't know.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:12.960
Uh, Alex P Carson says, O L R a your O L R logo is my Xbox gamer picture.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960
Well, thank you.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:14.960
Did you know?

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.640
And it's been a long time, but you can actually search for what's called community gamer picks

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.640
on Xbox live.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.880
And we're in the pack too.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.640
It's like the all games radio pack.

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.560
It has a bunch of icons for a bunch of all games radio shows.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.800
Uh, some of them aren't even on the air anymore cause it's been so long.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:35.800
Uh, but, uh, you know, we, there's an icon for O L R. There's an icon for Bobby.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.080
There's an icon for like video game outsiders and you know, there's a few shows that are

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.080
still on that have icons.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.140
So check that out.

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.140
Community gamer picks.

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:46.680
They're hard to find, but you can probably find them on the website a little easier.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.680
Um, evil protagonist says, I don't have a topic.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.880
I just want to tell you all how much I look forward to listening each and every week.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.880
Thanks for all you do.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.880
All.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:55.880
Thank you.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.880
That's very nice.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.000
And I apologize for this week's show cause it's kind of shit.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.720
Blue swim also says, Rob, your mom's burn on the O L R listeners was Epic.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.720
Yeah.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720
Well that's where I get it.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.480
Lastly, spazzinator or good buddy asks a WTF question.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:15.120
If major Nelson is the mouth of Microsoft, who is the asshole or appendix of Microsoft?

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.680
Ooh, that's a good one.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.720
Who's the asshole of Microsoft?

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.320
Um, my best guess, I mean, I don't think there's anybody who's just like a straight up jerk

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.640
that I can think of, but definitely a lot of what comes out of Peter Molyneux's mouth

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.700
is.

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:35.640
So that would be my best guess for you.

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.640
There it is.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.000
Rob, you know what I just got done typing?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
What's that?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
She'll cut a bitch.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
For what?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
It's a Kathy Griffin album.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Oh.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Isn't that a book?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Or something?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I don't know.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.760
No, I think that it's one of our shows.

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.760
Oh, okay.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.760
Couple more news stories for you guys and we have the classic game of the week.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.760
Yeehaw.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:03.720
Microsoft, speaking of which, well this is kind of an asshole thing to do, but not really.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.960
I get why they're doing it.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:09.560
They are suing Datel over the turbo fire controller.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.400
It's a wildfire is what it's called in the UK, which is where Datel is from.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.880
Unfortunately they say, you know what, this looks a little bit too much like an Xbox 360

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.880
controller.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.840
And I got to say, yeah, it definitely kind of looks like an Xbox 360 controller.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:27.960
But I kind of always thought the third party controllers all resembled the original controller

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.360
somewhat.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:36.120
But yeah, Microsoft is seeking monetary compensation and an injunction preventing the company from

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.440
manufacturing any more of the devices.

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:42.280
Now Datel and Microsoft, they've been going back and forth for a little while.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:46.120
I would guess that this was not a licensed Microsoft peripheral and that's part of the

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.120
problem.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.400
Because you might remember Datel, they made the memory cards that got the shaft from Microsoft.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.640
So I think that's what this, this is just these two companies just kind of going back

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.740
and forth at each other.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:00.960
It's a bummer because maybe the D-pad on this thing would have been better.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.560
And judging from the looks of it, it doesn't look so like a round D-pad, it might have

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.640
actually been a little better.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.280
Kind of a bummer.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:12.080
But hey, you know what, Microsoft, you know, they did make that controller.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.080
And they patented it.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:18.240
And if you make something a little too close, that's why people get sued, especially when

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.920
you're not already in the company's good favor.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.320
Oh well.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.520
Soon he's going to sue.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.520
Everybody loves to sue.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.680
All right, Dark Soccer.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:32.400
I wish I could sue my face.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.400
What a quote.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:41.720
So there's an MMO that's called PokeNet that was a fan run MMORPG based on Pokemon.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:51.360
And it was, actually Nintendo sent the request for them to shut it down at the end of March.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:19:01.120
And they postponed closing it, but they actually formally shut it down on April Fool's Day.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:04.120
And that's no joke.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.920
There's just a number of them though that have been shut down, but this is just the

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.920
newest one.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:14.400
And they said for the code that they created for the game, they're joking about using it

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.240
for Digimon or Monster Ranger, but most of their devs are giving up.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.080
That would be a funny little F-you, I suppose.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.640
That's a bummer, but it's not a surprise.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.400
I mean, Pokemon is one of Nintendo's most treasured MMOs.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.480
You know, I see that these guys are just trying to make the game that everybody wants, which

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:32.480
is the Pokemon MMO.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.240
I mean, that's what like tons and tons of gamers everywhere want.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.440
We've talked about it on this show.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.480
It could be a great thing for the franchise, and for whatever reason Nintendo is just refusing

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.120
to do it.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.360
Probably because of the fact that it's a kid-based game and that would be very hard to keep safe

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.040
and clean is probably part of the reason.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.040
But I mean, it's a bummer, but I think Nintendo's within their rights, certainly, you know,

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040
especially if it wasn't a quality product.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.040
They're absolutely in their rights.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.100
But I do think if the guys are that passionate about the product, they should go back and

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:02.840
make it a different type of monster.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.720
I mean, that would take a lot of re-art and all that stuff.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.640
And plus, if it's too close to the Pokemon idea, it might still get the smackdown.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.920
But I mean, Pokemon and Digimon can co-exist, and you know, they're not that different.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:20.800
I mean, yes, there's differences, but they come down to little pocket monsters and collecting

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:25.360
catch them all, catch them all, yada yada.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.800
But Nintendo's done that a lot lately.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:32.580
They shut down the Zelda project, the movie thing, remember that?

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:35.040
But you know, I get it.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.440
They have a right.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.440
You can't just go around making all this fake stuff because somebody out there is going

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.240
to think it's real, and then that's where the real problems start.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.920
Well, this was real, and this was licensed by Nintendo.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.080
And no matter what, Nintendo will never make this go away.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.560
The Super Mario Brothers Super Show!

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.800
That's right, the one with, rest in peace, Captain Lou Albano, starred as Mario.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.120
And of course, you know, they would do all these cute little live-action skits.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.120
And then they had the cartoons.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.520
Well, if you want to relive this from your childhood, or if you never got to experience

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.160
this as a child to begin with, guess what?

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.960
It's on Netflix.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.280
So you can actually go check this out.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.320
I believe it is on Instant Netflix right now.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.880
So you can go stream volume one of the collection and check out what you missed as a kid.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:22.800
I actually have, either volume one or volume two, I have one of the collections on DVD,

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.160
and it is so cheesy-cheeserific.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.700
It's amazing.

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:31.160
Just to give you a clue how amazing, here's a blast from the past.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.160
Listen up.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.160
Hey, McDonald's!

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.160
It's the Mario Brothers Super Show!

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.160
We're with the Mario Brothers, and the plumbing's a game.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.160
We're not with the others who get all the pain.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.160
If you think it's no trouble, you can call us on the double.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:51.720
We're faster than the others, you'll be hooked on the brothers.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.680
You'll be hooked on the brothers.

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:58.760
Do you ever watch this show growing up, Jamie?

01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.760
Yes.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.960
Except I was really religious about watching Zelda on Friday.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.960
Me too.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.120
Well, excuse me, princess.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:12.640
I don't believe that is a part of this, because the Zelda collection's different.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:21.120
Zelda was on a different DVD, and I don't know if you can stream those yet.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.280
The chat room's bitching about the audio quality.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.280
Well, boo-hoo!

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280
Alright.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:32.480
Anyhow, it's that part of the show where we really like to take a look back at classic

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:37.600
gaming's history, and pick one game to spotlight in a segment we call our Classic Game of the

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:38.600
Week.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:43.000
Dark Sakura's gonna dig through the gaming vault, she's gonna dive in head first, and

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.960
she's gonna sniff really loud, and whatever sticks to her nose first will be the game

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.960
of the week.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:51.120
So, Dark Sakura, what did Nosepawn pick as the game of the week?

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:55.920
Actually, it was Dan that picked the game, so you can blame him.

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.920
I think it's a fabulous game you picked this week, so I thank Dan for this.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:04.000
Well, it's Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Aw yeah, one of the best ones in the whole damn series.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Wah!

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Wah!

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Wah!

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Wah!

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Anyway.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:20.960
Basically, you go around as Yoshi, and you have baby Mario on your back, and you can

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:27.400
play different Yoshi's, and, um, it's supposed to be a prequel for Super Mario World, though,

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:32.640
technically, by the story, but I mean, your life bar is your baby Mario, and he falls

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.680
off your back, you have to go, he floats around in a little bubble and you have to go catch

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.600
him, and he gives the single most annoying cry ever.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.600
Wah!

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.600
Wah!

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.600
Wah!

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:45.600
Wah!

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.880
Seriously, I think this game scared me away from children for a long time.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:56.000
Um, but I mean, you go through, there's also, uh, you eat certain enemies, give you certain

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.760
colored eggs, you can throw them, you can eat certain enemies and shoot them just right

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:09.120
back at themselves, and, um, this is a pretty fun little game, um, and also, if you get,

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.720
um, a perfect score in all eight of the regular levels, you'll get a secret level, and there

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:22.600
are five flowers that you can pick up, um, in, in each stage, and you have red coins,

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:33.520
and all kinds of fun stuff that you can find, um, so basically you have to go and, uh, get

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.280
Baby Luigi back from Magikoopa Comic!

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:44.800
It also uses the Super FX2, um, for sprite scaling and polygon effects, and, um, all

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.000
kinds of stuff.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:57.200
But, um, it was actually, um, the particular style for it, um, the rumor is that it came

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:07.240
from an internal evaluation committee conflict with Nintendo, and, uh, Miyamoto was, uh,

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:13.640
instructed to use the Donkey Kong Country style of pre-rendered graphics, and so he altered

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.520
them to look as if they had been drawn with crayons.

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.520
Interesting.

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.760
I always thought this game kind of had a unique look to it.

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.960
That's kind of cool that that's where it came from.

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.960
Hmm.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960
Yeah.

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.960
Very cool.

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960
So that's it?

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.480
Yeah, that actually was given the award for Best Game of 1995 by EGM.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.840
It is a great game.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:39.960
As far as sequels, though, we've had, um, Yoshi Touch and Go and Yoshi's Universal Graviton

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:40.960
for the Game Boy Advance.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.960
Oh, I remember Touch and Go.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.840
And then Yoshi's Story came out on Nintendo 64.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:53.760
There was Yoshi's Island DS, and, um, Yoshi's Island, um, was used in, um, the SNES and

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.560
Game Boy versions of Tetris Attack as a background.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.560
I don't...

01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.560
Is this on the Wii?

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.560
I don't think it is.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.560
I don't think so.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560
I could be wrong.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.560
I could be wrong.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.560
Correct me if I'm wrong.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.560
I don't think it is on the Wii.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.560
No.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.560
But that's, but that's it.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.560
It's Yoshi.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.080
This is also the game with Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.760
And that was an amazing moment in gaming history.

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:16.280
If you don't know what Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy is, I'm sure it's got to be on YouTube somewhere,

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.280
right?

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.280
Please tell me it's on you.

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.280
Hold on.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280
Maybe.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280
Touch Fuzzy.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.280
There it is.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.280
I can't type today.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.280
I'm sick and there's earthquakes and I can't type.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.780
Okay, here we go.

01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:29.960
Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy.

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.920
And this is the level that's hilarious because when you would touch these big fuzzy looking

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.360
things, then your guy would just go psycho.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.360
It was amazing.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.360
And then he probably wouldn't do that.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.000
See, I think this is like a speed run.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
How about this one?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.400
Touch Fuzzy, Get Stoned.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.400
What is this?

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.880
Fucking people.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.520
Apparently someone put in clips of Raiden DX.

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.520
Apparently.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:02.800
Because that has everything to do with Super Mario Brothers.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.200
Comments from our chat room.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:07.200
Shao Ran says, that game, it kicked my ass.

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.200
I'm not afraid to admit it.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.200
Tiger Claw said, never played this game, but it seems like Nintendo always retconned the

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.200
Mario games.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.640
So Mario and Luigi knew about the Mushroom Kingdom since they were toddlers.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.280
Well, if they were that young, they wouldn't have remembered it.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:21.160
Salacious Pops says, I thought it had some kind of new chip in it that they debuted with

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.160
the game.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.160
Yes, it was the FX2 chip, wasn't it?

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.960
Yeah, it was the Super FX2.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:25.960
Yeah.

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.240
It made it a bitch to emulate for a long time, I remember.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.440
That was one of the prized emulated games when it finally happened.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.520
Well, believe it or not, we are reaching the end of our show, and the part where we're

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.680
going to open up the Skype line to your calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.260
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.680
The phone lines are open.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:43.680
We're taking calls right now.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.840
It is a short show tonight, because as you can tell, we're a little bit sick and out

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:47.840
of it tonight.

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.960
So yeah, we're going to make it a short night here.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.000
So go ahead and give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Radio.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.280
This is the part of the show where I'd ask Loki for any last-minute stories, but I'm

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.280
guessing Darsagra?

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.280
Does she have any last-minute stories?

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:02.700
I don't have anything.

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.160
Her last-minute story is Benadryl.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.560
That is her last-minute stories.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.480
So we're just going to wait for the phone to ring here, because I don't have anything

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.480
either.

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.640
Damn it, call us, people!

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:18.200
Next week, Loki should be back, and hopefully he won't be sick.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.200
We'll be fresh from my birthday beer pot look.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.200
Yes.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.200
Hopefully I'll be feeling better.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.080
I'm having a beer pot look for my birthday.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.880
It's going to be awesome.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:28.880
I'm coming.

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.880
It's going to be fun.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.880
So soon?

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.880
Shut up.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.440
You know something we ought to look into for the show, by the way?

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:39.440
Last night at the show, at Rocky, somebody had this app on their iPhone 3GS that was

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:44.480
a Ustream app, so you could actually stream video from your iPhone.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:48.640
So you might want to look into that for your phone, to see if we can do webcam again with

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.640
your iPhone.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.440
And you could be the camera woman on the show.

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.440
Maybe.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.520
It's going to be fun.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.960
We'll see.

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.520
Is no one calling in?

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.120
Nothing's happening?

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:06.360
If you want to call in and share a story with us, you can.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.360
I don't mind.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.640
AlphaKananogram says I should leave a drunk voicemail from the beer pot look.

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:17.800
I'll probably have to drive, so I don't think that'll be happening, because I'm a good boy.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.080
Some callers are saying that they get the voicemail when they call.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.360
Well, nothing is ringing through, so keep trying, folks.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:26.720
Hey, DarkTetsuya is probably calling in trying to talk about WonderCon.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.920
Did you know that happened this weekend, WonderCon?

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.440
A big, big convention that happened in San Francisco over the weekend.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.360
Was a huge deal.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.960
I think it's like the second biggest comic book convention, only next to Comic-Con.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.160
And yeah, it was going on in San Francisco this weekend.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.160
Sadly, I couldn't go.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:50.040
I was in San Francisco, but I'm still so sick, and I was kind of conned out, which is all

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.320
so bad.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.880
You know what, I'm gonna restart Skype, just in case something is going wrong with the

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.880
Skypey thing.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.840
Let me just quit, quit, quit.

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:04.960
I'm gonna quit, and I'm gonna reboot Skype, and we'll see if we get a call.

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:11.640
Of course, I have to log in, because I don't ever save the password.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.760
And it is Easter, so it's a little bit slower of a night anyway, so we might not get a lot

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.760
of calls.

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.760
Bobby apparently had no calls on his show.

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.240
I thought he had at least one.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.640
He had at least one.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:25.480
Somebody said they were trying to call, but they got a busy signal, so I thought, okay,

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.280
let's restart Skype and see what happens.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.280
It's my mom.

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.680
She did something.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:32.960
My mother, when she told all the listeners to go outside, basically.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.000
She grounded Skype.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
She did.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.640
She put Skype on time out.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:38.640
So let's see what happens.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:47.720
Skype line is open 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:50.400
Give us a call.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.920
And BlackWolf said he did have one call, but it was an echo chamber, so it must have been

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:58.280
something going on there.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:03.760
Any exciting plans for your week, DarkSakura, besides the beer potluck?

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.760
Maybe...

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:08.500
I don't know.

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.200
Probably doing homework, really.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.120
Good times.

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:15.880
Nonstop party for you, DarkSakura.

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.840
What are you studying these days?

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.160
What are you gonna be when you grow up?

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:29.400
Hopefully a designer, which I'm already doing now, but I'm working on a website for my DreamMover

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.400
class.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.400
Thank God, we're getting a call.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.680
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:33.680
Who's this?

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:35.960
Yar had his revenge.

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.600
Hi, Bobby.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.960
How are you?

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.000
I'm doing good.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.200
Your Skype works, by the way.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.680
Yeah, that's good to know.

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:43.680
Thanks, Bobby.

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:48.200
No, I'm glad you called, because we're always on your show, so it's only fair that you come

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.200
on to ours.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.560
That means you've actually been listening to this trainwreck of a show tonight.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.280
I'm so sorry.

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.440
It's been fun.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.320
It's been very interesting, that's for sure.

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:01.920
What kind of games have you been playing this week besides Yar's revenge, obviously?

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:03.920
Astro Smash.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.400
And no, I've been playing Final Fantasy 13 as the real game, quote unquote, that I've

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.400
been playing.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.880
How far are you into that game at this point?

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:16.600
I am on Chapter 10, so if I was on the Xbox 360, I would have just put in Disc 3.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:21.840
Wow, you are way past me, because I think I'm on Chapter 9.

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.320
That's the best place to farm Gil.

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.000
That's the airship, right?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
No.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Actually, no.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I'm way back then.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.040
I'm like maybe Chapter 7.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:33.040
I'm in Palimporum, and I got to Hope's dad.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.760
I'm not trying to spoil too much.

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.760
That's where I quit.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:40.760
I got Hope's dad in the little emo scene with that, and then I stopped right after that.

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.760
That's where I'm at.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:47.000
That's the best place to farm money, because all those soldiers drop those credit chips

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.080
and incentive chips, and those give 500 Gil and 2500 Gil each.

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.620
I'm going to remember that.

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.280
So when I'm on the airship, I should farm a crap ton of Gil.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:57.280
Yes.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.280
Pro tip.

01:32:58.280 --> 01:32:59.280
I like that.

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:00.280
Good tip.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:05.440
Any games that you're looking forward to that are coming out in the near future, Bobby?

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:06.840
Not really.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.840
Not in the near future.

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.800
April is kind of a slow month all of a sudden.

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.640
I guess things are going to pick up once the Crackdowns and the Red Dead Redemptions and

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.040
all that start coming out.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.040
E3.

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.560
Are you doing E3 this year?

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.840
I'm hoping to go to E3.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:25.960
I did finally get my tax return, so I can finally start booking things, because I couldn't

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.640
go to PAX East because I decided buying a house was more important.

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.640
Well, yeah.

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.640
Priorities.

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.640
Priorities.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:36.320
But I'm still a renter, so I had that disposable income that you needed.

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.760
But yeah, I'm definitely going to E3.

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.040
I'm making it happen.

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.280
Have you guys talked about the blur beta at all?

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.560
A little bit.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.760
I have played it.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.800
What do you want to say about it?

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.320
I still haven't figured out if it's...

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.320
I call it...

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.560
I say it's insane.

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:55.040
I haven't figured out if it's insanely good or insanely bad yet.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.040
Why is that?

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.560
What makes the game insane?

01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:01.640
Well, it's Mario Kart meets Need for Speed.

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:02.640
Which is a great idea.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.440
That's basically what the game is.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:11.520
It depends on the map that you're playing, if it's fair or not, if you're not extremely

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:16.980
good at it, or know all the sight lines and all that stuff.

01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:21.840
And what sucks is that I'm only good at one map, and that's the one map nobody chooses.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.460
But it is fun.

01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.160
It's actually a game I don't mind playing with random people, because I just don't listen

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.760
to them.

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:29.760
I don't either.

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:32.600
I just don't turn on my headset when I'm playing that game.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.600
Do you think you'll pick up the full version when it comes out?

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:40.820
I will at least rent it, because I want to see how the single player is.

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.480
I'm still looking forward to Split Second.

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:49.680
But what worries me about Split Second is that I don't want...

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:54.600
Because I loved full auto, because the demo I played at E3 was amazing.

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.600
It was awesome.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.600
It was great.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:57.600
Then I got the game, and I didn't like it all that much.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.960
I know Loki did, but he's not there.

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:06.920
But I'm afraid Split Second made an amazing demo, and the rest of the game won't live

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:07.920
up to it.

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.400
And I'm really afraid of that.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.160
Well, you know what's interesting is that they were parading Split Second around PAX

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.720
East, and it looks like they brought the same damn booth to PAX East that they had at E3,

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:18.360
although it was configured differently for the space.

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.360
I think it was the same demo, too.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.760
I can't say that with 100% certainty, because I don't remember that far back, but I think

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.720
it was the same darn demo that we had at E3.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.440
So it's interesting that this game is still not out.

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:32.760
At the airport or something, where the control tower's crashing around you and stuff.

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.760
It seemed like it.

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.480
I mean, I honestly didn't really play it again.

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.320
I watched for a little bit, and it just seemed the same to me.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.280
It looked like I was looking at the same thing.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.920
But I don't pick out a lot of those little graphical things and things like that.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:52.320
I mean, imagine it has to be a newer version, but it was probably the same stages or something.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.320
Not really.

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.800
I mean, because I guess looking from a game developer point of view, they're not gonna

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:03.300
spend too much more resources just to show kids at PAX East.

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:08.360
Because the PAX demo at PAX Prime was the same as the E3 demo.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:14.120
So it's very possible that they just, instead of spending the money making a new demo, they're

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.320
trying to get the game out in time.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.440
Because I think it's supposed to come out before E3, so they're not gonna spend time

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.720
making a new E3 demo, unless it gets pushed back again.

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:29.440
But I can't see them for PAX East, unfortunately.

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:33.120
I can't see them spending all that time making a new demo when they have a perfectly good

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:36.880
one from E3 that is impressive.

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:37.880
That's true.

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:40.280
And probably a lot of people that were at that expo had never played it before, because

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.040
it was a totally different crowd.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:48.120
Well Bobby, anything else on your mind before we try to go back and see if we get any other

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.120
calls tonight?

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.480
Or maybe it'll just be you, who knows?

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:52.880
Yarr.

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.000
I'm gonna work on that this week, Bobby.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.120
Like I told you on your show, I've never been better at Yarr's Revenge in my life until

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:01.840
you inspired me to kick your butt.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.200
And you haven't kicked it yet.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200
I'm trying.

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.400
I've one-upped you a couple times.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.800
I've made you work.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.800
You have to admit that.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:08.800
I made you work.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:09.800
Yes, you did.

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:10.800
Alright, there you go.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:11.800
There it is.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:12.800
And then you bow down and go home.

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:13.800
Alright, shut up.

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:14.800
Alright.

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:15.800
Somebody else call in.

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.800
Don't make it just me.

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.800
Alright, have a good one, Bobby.

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:18.800
See ya.

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.000
Alright, so we know it works.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.720
Bobby got through, at least the Skypline works.

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.720
We know that much.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.720
I know it calls out okay.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.280
We called my mommy earlier.

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:28.920
877-K-M-O-L-R, username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:32.200
I'm starting to feel like really headachy, so I don't know how much longer we can keep

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:33.200
this show going.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:40.040
But we're gonna try to get at least one more call in on our Skypline.

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:42.080
And then we're gonna wrap up the show.

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.320
We will be back next week with an all-new edition of OrangeLawnsRadio, of course.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.680
Same bat time, same bat channel.

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:52.440
I think I mentioned it a minute ago, but I should make sure to plug this, because after

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.000
all we do steal the man's bandwidth every week.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Our old putty, putty, our old putty, putty, silly putty.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.240
Our old buddy, Scott Rubin, who hosts, he's kind of the grand poopa, if you will, of all

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.240
games radio.

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:09.840
He is starting his own little show, but it's actually a big show, at Appaday.tv, and he's

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.380
reunited with Diane Miyazoda.

01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.960
It's like G4, back when they were cool.

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:13.960
Hey, we're getting a call.

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:14.960
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:15.960
Who's this?

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:19.800
Uh, this is Henderson Mann.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.040
Well, hi, Henderson Mann.

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.040
How are you?

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.760
Oh, I'm doing alright.

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:24.760
Welcome to the show.

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:27.160
Yeah, I've been a long time listener.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.040
I've probably listened for, like, the last two years.

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:36.080
In fact, it was your show that introduced me to all games radio years ago, and now I

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.520
have my own live show on Saturdays on all games.

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.520
What is your show?

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:47.440
Distributed Failure, where you come on at 3 p.m. Pacific time on Saturdays.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.120
I have heard of that program.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.120
Congratulations.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.440
That is awesome.

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.600
So make sure Scott knows that.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:54.600
That's good.

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.440
People have heard of us.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.440
That's awesome.

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.120
Well, what is on your mind, my friend?

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.040
What do we do with a phone call tonight?

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.120
I just wanted to say, you know, you guys look like you're having trouble with Skype, and

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:10.060
I just wanted to call in and say hey and tell you guys I'm a long time listener, and I did

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:14.200
finish Final Fantasy XIII, which I thought was decent, but I still think it's low on

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.620
the totem pole of Final Fantasy games.

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:17.620
Not as low as VIII.

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:21.400
I think VIII is the worst Final Fantasy game ever created.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:25.880
You and I can agree on at least one thing, that's for sure.

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:30.200
I didn't care much for VII either, but I did love IX.

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:34.880
I think IX is one of the best, at least it's the best one on the PS1 era.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:39.960
I would rather level a character from I through VII on Final Fantasy XI than play five more

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:42.080
minutes of Final Fantasy VIII.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.560
I even bought the PSN version to try to go back and finish it, because it's like one

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:49.800
of the only ones I've never finished, and I couldn't do it.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:51.880
I still couldn't get to my first disc.

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:56.160
What made me mad originally when I played it is I got to a section of the game, and

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.720
it's kind of spoiler-ish, but not really, because basically...

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:04.120
There's only a six-month moratorium on spoilers, and it's passed, so spoil away.

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.120
Okay.

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.280
Your female character that's supposed to be your girlfriend in the game, I can't think

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.800
of her name right now, but there's a section of the game where you go to a location because

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.960
she gets taken, and when she gets taken, she's in this tower where all the enemies are level

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:23.600
one, and you're supposed to have a special summons or whatever that can raise the levels

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:24.600
so you can gain levels.

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:29.200
Well, I got stuck at a boss there and couldn't get past the boss, because the boss was too

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:33.880
tough, but I couldn't gain any levels because everything was level one.

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:37.280
I tried to leave, and it wouldn't let you leave, so I got stuck in this endless loop,

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:39.840
and I just eventually couldn't do anything, so I just quit playing the game.

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.440
Stupid-ass system in that game.

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.640
Just a dumb-ass system.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.620
I mean, the whole weapon system was ridiculous, where you had to go around finding these items

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:50.520
to upgrade your weapons, so basically every battle in that game ended up being, oh, I'll

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.360
just summon this monster that takes forever to watch all of its animation.

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.360
Wonderful story, though.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.360
I will say this.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.900
Final Fantasy VIII had a great story.

01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:01.440
They should have just made it the movie, honestly.

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:03.000
They should have just made it the movie.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Oh, well.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.640
I did have a great story, but yeah, that was the gameplay ruined that game so, so much,

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:15.200
and I try to go back to it on PSP, and it actually looks decent on PSP, which is amazing

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.560
because, you know, it is a PlayStation 1 game, but that smaller screen and everything being

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.040
so compact, it does make the graphics stand out.

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:28.100
Even Yars' Revenge looks awesome on my LCD monitor, like, you know, there's just a certain,

01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:31.840
there's just something to it that we didn't have back in, you know, the, back in the day

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:32.840
of gaming.

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.840
I attempted to play that game because I remember playing that game when I was like five and

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:40.480
six years old, dude, and I just remember you go in that little middle section and the bullets

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:47.680
wouldn't hurt you and all that, but man, it's, I picked up Adventure on there, but I haven't

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:48.680
tried it yet.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:53.640
I just, I had to pick it up because, you know, it's Adventure, and then I also picked up

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:56.560
Crystal Castle, which is kind of hard to control on that.

01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:00.920
Yeah, because, you know, that game needs a trackball, not a analog stick.

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.280
I can't imagine that that.

01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.160
I haven't played that one yet, I'll be honest, I've kind of avoided it because I know it's

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:10.840
can't control that well, but I just, I worry about the whole trackball versus analog stick.

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:14.840
But Yars' Revenge, seriously, best five bucks I've spent on Xbox Live in the past, like,

01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:15.840
six months.

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:18.880
I may have to pick that one up then, I've been looking for something, I think I also

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.600
picked up Kicker or Shailen Road or whatever it's called, that's, that wasn't too bad.

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.800
I really hope they bring out some better arcade games, I mean, I am disappointed they're waiting

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:33.160
until after April or, like, the middle of April or end of April to bring anything else

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:36.640
out, I think that's really killing the momentum of the people that really like Game Room.

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.640
Well, it'll be here before you know it, and my hope is, is that there'll be, like, a couple

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.440
huge games that come out, like, you know, BurgerTime, I'm just kidding, but, you know,

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:47.440
something like really huge, or like-

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.880
Oh, I would love some BurgerTime, dude, I would love BurgerTime.

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:54.400
Like a 90s era game, or something to just, like, really, like, knock people off their

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.040
feet for a minute, like, something like, I don't know, like, like, I don't know, like,

01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:00.720
NARC or something, well, no, I guess Midway Games are-

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:01.720
Bad dudes!

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:02.720
We need bad dudes!

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.720
Okay, bad dudes.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.720
So, Bad Dudes comes out of Game Room.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.800
Are you a bad enough dude to eat a cheeseburger with the mayor?

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:08.800
And then-

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:09.800
The president.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:10.800
The president.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:12.480
Yeah, the mayor was Final Fight.

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.480
That's okay, though.

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:17.720
Uh, and then, yeah, and then, like, that'll get a lot of eyes back on Game Room, but hopefully

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.040
they get all their stinkin' server problems figured out by that point.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:24.680
Hey, did you happen to see that that Data East collection that came out on Wii, or,

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:28.280
I don't know if that's came out yet or not, it's got BurgerTime and Bad Dudes on there,

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.280
so that's why I'm kinda hoping it'll come to Game Room.

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:35.320
It does, and, um, some of the, uh, uh, uh, I believe, I haven't played it myself, but

01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:38.120
I believe it has, like, the sequel to BurgerTime as well.

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:42.800
Ooh, I love me some BurgerTime, I've been tempted to try to find that.

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:43.800
Yeah.

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:47.840
So, uh, it seems like a pretty good deal, I haven't played it myself, but it'll be pretty

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:48.840
cool.

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.560
Oh yeah, Dartitsu's reminding me in chat, NARC is M-rated anyway, so it can't come to

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:52.560
Game Room.

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.560
Whatever.

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.560
Technicality.

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.160
Just turned the blood into sweat, that's, that's what they did back in my day.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.520
Alright, Henderson, man, we're gonna let you go to try and squeeze in one more call, but

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:07.160
thanks so much for the call, and, uh, Distributed Failure, Distributed Fai-, I'm sick, Distributed

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.160
Failure.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.160
Distributed Failure.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.800
Which I am failing to say the name of correctly, but, uh, it's a lot of fun.

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.120
What did they talk about on Distributed Failure, is it a techie show, is it a game show, is

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:17.120
it a-

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.880
It's a game show, we talk about what we've been playing, we talk about video game news,

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:23.880
kinda like this, um, kinda like all games radio in the past, we have live callers and

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:29.040
stuff, well, nobody ever calls into our show, hardly, so, um, but, you know, it's, uh, you

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.040
can find the-

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.040
That's alright, it happens to all of us.

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.040
Alright.

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:35.240
Yeah, I said you can find the archives at distributedfailure.com, so, you know, if anybody

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:39.600
wants to listen and check it out, it's there, and we're live on Saturdays, so.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.200
Best of luck with your show, sir.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:42.200
Alrighty.

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.200
Thank you very much, guys.

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.200
Tell the crew at Distributed Failure we all said hey.

01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:48.720
Alright, and bye, Jamie.

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.720
Alright.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.720
Bye.

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:51.720
Take care.

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:55.560
Alright, sniffle, sniffle, let's try to get at least one more call in, I don't know, something

01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:59.240
seems to be borked with the phone, the actual phone people, I think, are having problems

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:03.680
tonight, I don't know why, I saw- you all heard me call my mother.

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.160
It seemed to be working fine, so, I don't know what's up.

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:10.120
Your guess is as good as mine.

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:12.800
We'll give it just a couple more minutes for a call to come in, and if it doesn't come

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:16.980
in, then I'll just chalk up the phone's not working to, uh, just get another thing going

01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:19.080
wrong today, with, between the, uh, earthquakes-

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.080
They have the plague.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.880
The rainstorm, and the plague.

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:24.800
Do you think zombie Jesus did it?

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:29.200
Apparently Rama's trying to call in, Dartitsuya's trying to call in, I think Spaznator on Twitter

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:31.840
said he was gonna call in, something appears to be wrong with the phone line itself, I

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:39.720
don't know what it is, like, watch, I bet if I call, like, I don't know, like, watch,

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:50.000
I'm gonna call my cell, right now, and it's calling.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.880
And there, my phone's ringing, there it is, it's working.

01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:03.880
I don't know, the phone's, uh, stupid, it's the earthquakes, just blame it on the earthquakes.

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:09.280
Alright, well, sorry guys, I don't know what to do, I guess we're just gonna have to close

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:15.080
up shop for the night, and blame the earthquakes for taking down Skype tonight.

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.600
You can't always leave voicemail, send us emails as well, mail back at orangesonshredder.com,

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.840
I know Dartitsuya probably wanted to call in to talk about WonderCon, but he also did

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:26.560
a fabulous write-up that's available on the site, orangesloungeradio.com, if you want

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:31.600
to read that, he has a whole little wrap-up on WonderCon, hopefully we'll get some of

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:37.100
these people in next week, I'm sure Rama wanted to call in to talk about Anime Boston, I know

01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:42.800
he was there, but sadly, Skype got earthquakes or something, I don't know what's going on.

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:51.240
Shauran in chat says, blame it on the rain, I will, blame it on the rain, it is definitely

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:54.560
time to put the nail in the coffin of this week's episode of Orange Laundrio, but hey,

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:57.760
if you made it this far in the show, then you rock, thank you so much for tuning in

01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:02.960
to our show, and supporting independent podcasting, even at its lowest.

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.600
If you liked our show tonight, all we ask, tell two people about our show, we swear it'll

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:10.680
be better next week, when we're better again and Loki's back, although I don't know, something

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.760
tells me there's some of our fans that probably thought tonight's episode is actually pretty

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.760
cool.

01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.600
DarkSakura, thanks for being here and sticking it out through the show.

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.600
I live here.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:21.800
I know, do you have a final thought tonight?

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:24.120
My Ben and Jill's kind of working.

01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:29.280
My final thought is, Musinex is my friend, and I'm going to go take some more right now,

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.000
have a great night everybody, we'll see you next week with another edition of Orange Laundrio

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.640
that won't be so broken, and have a plan in case of an earthquake, just saying, just saying,

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:42.080
and over this next week, have your earthquake plan prepared.

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.080
Good night!

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:47.080
