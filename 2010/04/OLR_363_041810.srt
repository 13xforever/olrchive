00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,840
Tonight, April 18th, 2010, PlayStation Network releases are on the move.

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,000
Does playing violent video games impact your sleep and how can you get free soundtracks

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,800
from recent releases?

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 363 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,640
talk show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,960
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,480
the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,360
Does it count if I only have half a voice?

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,400
You know, I just got this feeling coming in here tonight, Dark Sakura, that you really

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,040
weren't prepared for tonight's episode and that's okay.

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,200
We all have our off days, but let me, let me paint a picture for the listeners.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,360
Just, just imagine if you will, you know, I get here to Jamie's house and yeah, I get

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
here.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,660
You should hear about an hour before showtime because you know, we have to prep the intro

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,160
and get the mixing board set up and all the things that have to happen to make a show

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
work.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
I wasn't naked.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
No, you weren't naked.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Thank God.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,040
But the minute I walk in the door and I start to kind of walk back towards the room, Jamie's

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,480
like, Oh, hold on a minute.

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,760
And she runs to the bathroom.

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Like, like she's the flash.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, do not.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,760
She runs to the bathroom like the flash and I'm like, Oh, Oh, I guess she just had Taco

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,800
Bell for lunch or something.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,640
And she comes out and she, she's, she's carrying something and she, she runs into a room and

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm like, what is going on?

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,320
And she's like, sorry, I just, I didn't want you to see my unmentionables drawing.

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,240
Like girl, please.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,520
Like I've never seen a bra before.

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
I might be gay, but it doesn't mean that, you know.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
But I am modest.

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,760
No, I know.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm a very modest person.

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,440
I may be a modest in personality, but I make up for it in personal modesty.

37
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,800
And she probably doesn't appreciate me telling that story on the air, but it's funny.

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
And that's what's most important.

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
You're worse than my mother.

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
All right.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,400
Also say hello to the one and only, uh, tech master low key.

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Hello.

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,680
Thankfully I have not seen his unmentionables hanging up to dry, even though we lived together

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
for a couple of years.

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,880
He was, he was very good about folding his laundry because we had a dryer and probably

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
putting it away.

47
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Yes.

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,680
You can't put a bra in the dryer.

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
It warps.

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
Exactly.

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Didn't we learn anything from watching Hedvig?

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Uh, we put, you know, uh, bras in the dryer all the time.

53
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
It's just fine.

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Yeah.

55
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
You don't do it when you pay 50 bucks for them.

56
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
All right.

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Eddie out.

58
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
All right.

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,880
Uh, once in a while we talk about video games here on this program, not just drying bra,

60
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,120
drying bras, but how was your week, low key?

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,040
Tons of the, uh, young male demographic really want to know how to wash a bra.

62
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,160
That's important life skills.

63
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
You know what?

64
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
You know what?

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Wait till you're married.

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
You know what?

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
You'll get a woman to sleep with you like that.

68
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
If you know how to do her laundry.

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Seriously.

70
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,280
If Dan would do my laundry, I'd be happy, but I'm too afraid he'll screw it up.

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
True story.

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,380
Um, dark soccer and I took a trip to the cherry blossom festival yesterday in San Francisco

73
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,360
and Jamie had one of her friends and I had Alan with me and it was like the four of us

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
in San Francisco.

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
We were at the San Francisco cherry blossom festival and we went to this bookstore, the

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Japanese bookstore.

77
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
You know the name of it?

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
I don't know.

79
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Okay.

80
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Thank you.

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Um, good shoe tight.

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
Uh, so they, it's a really large store.

83
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,080
Like they have magazines on the first floor and uh, you know that you can get a copy of

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,160
for me to their manga and entire yaoi section, which is pretty impressive, but they have

85
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,740
some funny like English books upstairs, like gift gag books, like one little section and

86
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:42,160
one of the books I saw was porn for women and you open it up and it's just like pictures

87
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,480
of guys like not like, no, I mean they're clothed and everything, but it's like a guy

88
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,880
holding a baby saying like, gosh, why don't I take care of the child for an hour so you

89
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,160
can go out to a movie or something and you know, or vacuuming.

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Yeah.

91
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Guys have naked vacuuming and you know what?

92
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm actually, I don't really think that many of those guys are super attractive because

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
they're like too muscular.

94
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,680
You know, I like, I like a, I like a David Bowie.

95
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
You like him a little nerdy.

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
I like him a little androgynous.

97
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
All right.

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
All right.

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:19,520
And I married Dan who was like so completely dude it doesn't, but you know, Dan fights

100
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:26,560
with me and, and you know what the, you know what the song is Break Up to Make Up.

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,320
Oh, well, hey, oh, hey, all right, well, uh, let's uh, get into video games and start off

102
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,040
the show as we usually do.

103
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,120
Not with a broad discussion or, or cherry blossom discuss him, but for the record, what?

104
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,800
It's a really comfy bra.

105
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
How was your gaming week?

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Help.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,720
Oh wait, I have to say the spiel about the chat room.

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,600
Uh, we do tape live every week on all games radio, www.allgames.com at six Pacific right

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

110
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,280
If you are listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chair room.

111
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,320
If we haven't scared you off yet, congratulations.

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,880
Chat dot orange lounge, radio.com.

113
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,620
Jamie, how was your gaming week?

114
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,080
I did lots of gaming, Rob.

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,840
I've beaten espa beluga whale, too.

116
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
Why do I want to add another syllable there?

117
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Espa-gluda.

118
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Yes.

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Two.

120
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Espa-gluda.

121
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Twice on my iPhone.

122
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Dose.

123
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,700
It is amazing on the iPhone.

124
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:30,080
It is seriously easy to control, very, very, very, very, very, very overwhelmingly Japanese

125
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,400
as in they didn't bother translating it, just the text.

126
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,840
Um, and in fact, the endings have a little bit of Engrish in them.

127
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,000
I think it's hilarious and it's just fun.

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's really fun.

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,540
You have like two different, you have two modes with three difficulties and, um, the,

130
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,440
the way that I've just been playing in novice mode, just to get used to it, of course, of

131
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
course I beat it.

132
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,200
Um, but in novice mode you have auto fire on and, um, you only have your, what is it?

133
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,060
Your enlightened attack or something.

134
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,120
And then it, you have to, then you've got another thing open for regular mode and then

135
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,400
all of your selections open, including your fire on the other.

136
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,720
So, but really I just like shooting stuff and it's really, it's a gorgeous game.

137
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
It is gorgeous.

138
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,840
I've actually on my, um, my Twitter, I've put a few, I actually put probably my last

139
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,480
three twit pic posts have been pictures of the game.

140
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,120
So it's pretty epic.

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,560
I find I've been really neglecting my Twitter these past couple of weeks.

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Like I've just been very bad.

143
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,840
That's what happens when you're getting there.

144
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,480
Which is, no, it has nothing to do with that.

145
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,480
I think it has to do with the fact that I, I'm having, I mean, here's the thing, there's

146
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,180
a lot of great OLR listeners that follow me on Twitter and I want to share, especially

147
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,400
like the gamey related things and you know, funny life stories and little, you know, vignettes

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,960
and little things like, yes, vignettes, it's a fun word to say vignette, uh, in 140.

149
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,600
Is that the brand of your bra vignette, um, 140 characters or less.

150
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
But here's the thing.

151
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:02,560
My bra is comfy, I'm having a hard time justifying my continued existence and participation on

152
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,360
a website where Justin Bieber is the number one topic of discussion every single day.

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Like I kind of feel like on moral grounds, I kind of object.

154
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
You know what, Rob?

155
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
I don't pay attention to that shit.

156
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
It makes things a lot better.

157
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,040
Whenever you go to twitter.com, trending topics, Justin Bieber, because half the people are

158
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,000
like, you know, you know, fawning over him, the other half are like, who's Justin, Justin

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Bieber.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I really don't know who that is.

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Anyway.

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,240
I don't look at the trending topics.

163
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,480
I think like a Disney channel, I still want to get President Cat as a trending topic.

164
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,000
We tried that a long time ago.

165
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,880
We got, we got us a mention on some of the game blogs, but it didn't, didn't get trending

166
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
topics.

167
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
They're, they're, they're buttholes.

168
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
All right.

169
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Love, love, love, love.

170
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
All right.

171
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Anyway.

172
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Sorry.

173
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:57,920
We got us Espa Galuda, Beluga, I played Beluga, um, um, um, oh yeah, I actually started a

174
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,360
little bit of Braid and then, um, I remember that I had a whole bunch of other stuff I

175
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
had to do.

176
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I played some STO.

177
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm really way behind on Star Trek Online right now and I will tell everybody why, and

178
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,360
you saw me working on it.

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,400
Um, so I'm going to give it a plug because I can, the temple that I go to, um, here in

180
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,720
Sacramento or Orangeville, technically, um, temple or Rishon is having a fundraiser, big,

181
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,960
big fundraiser in the area, um, on, on Sunday, the 25th, it's called All That Jazz.

182
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Just look it up online.

183
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,600
Um, big fundraiser, twenties, thirties, forties themed kind of roundabout.

184
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,240
And I'm doing their newsletter, I'm doing a big newspaper for them as a giveaway to

185
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,960
everyone who comes in and you know, so that's what I've been tearing my hair out over and

186
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
I was sick.

187
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,920
So if you're in the area, if you're in the area, come share a lahaim, spend a good 60

188
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
bucks and go.

189
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
All right.

190
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
It's a, it's a fundraiser.

191
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,460
It's for a good cause, but as a result, I've had no life and I've been sick on top of it

192
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,640
and I'm actually feeling a lot better today than I did.

193
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,320
My voice is coming and going, but I've been sick.

194
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
So while I've been sick, I've been working on this.

195
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,360
So yeah, but it's coming along well.

196
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,060
Tiger Claw in our chat room, uh, links us to a Wikipedia article on Justin Bieber because

197
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,460
of course Wiki will solve everything, but let me put it in a nutshell.

198
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,800
You know what, like Donny Osmond was like 30 years ago.

199
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
Like he was so Mormon.

200
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,600
Oh, this guy's like, yeah, that's just, that's, that's basically what Justin Bieber is now,

201
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
but without the crazy sister.

202
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
He has hat hair.

203
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Yeah.

204
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Anyway, that please no more Justin Bieber talk on this program.

205
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
He has hat hair.

206
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,640
Uh, and then Shahran says, if you have that much of a problem with it, then maybe you

207
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,840
should stop using Twitter.

208
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,960
Shahran, that's exactly what's happened the past couple of weeks.

209
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,560
I've been Facebooking and now four squares.

210
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,800
The other one I use, which I really shouldn't use, like I'm going to get posted on please

211
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,440
rob me.com, but I'm kind of addicted to it.

212
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Like I can't explain it.

213
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
It's, it's partially a game.

214
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,480
They made a game out of social networking.

215
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
I don't know.

216
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
You know what?

217
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
I pretty much stick with my Facebook.

218
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,280
Look, at least I gave up Farmville, so I think I deserve props for that.

219
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm trying to pay more attention to Twitter because I've, as I was telling you yesterday

220
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,280
about my plan to become, um, a true nothing celebrity, you know, I want to be famous for

221
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
absolutely nothing.

222
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Like Paris Hilton.

223
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,160
I said, I'm not going to put my twat on the internet, but you have to be rich.

224
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,540
Well, that's what sponsorships for.

225
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,540
Not necessarily.

226
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,540
Tila Tequila.

227
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,640
I mean, I, I look at her and I go, I can remind me why she's famous.

228
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,560
I can have eight babies at once, but no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I want to be, I, I'm, I'm going

229
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,080
for, um, I'm going for a certain, I'm going for Warhol famous because you either have

230
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,440
to be slutty or rich, actually mostly slutty.

231
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm going to hire people to be me in public.

232
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:51,560
You should have your own bra company, designer bras, designer bras, smiley faces over the

233
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
boob or something.

234
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
I don't know.

235
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,200
I'm going to finish working on my cork.

236
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
All right.

237
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Yes.

238
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Please.

239
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Let's go to a Loki with the, how was your gaming week?

240
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Loki?

241
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Um, it was all right.

242
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Didn't play a whole lot.

243
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,560
Um, just some of the typical stuff like grand theft auto, of course, still playing some

244
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
of that.

245
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
This sucked the last few days.

246
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,240
Uh, my coworkers have been out of the office for different reasons and so it's been very

247
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,560
difficult to find a game and when I do get a game, everybody quits cause I kicked crap

248
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
out of them.

249
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
All right.

250
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Yes.

251
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Which is very disappointing.

252
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
There's a little echo there.

253
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
Sorry.

254
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,680
And then, um, what else?

255
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
New stuff.

256
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
I've been playing.

257
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,040
Um, I tried, uh, no more heroes paradise or whatever the hell it's called in Japan.

258
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,000
It's the 360 port of no more heroes, the game on the Wii.

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,720
And I got to say, I like it better on the 360 than on the Wii.

260
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,440
Um, it just seemed easier for me to control.

261
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,560
Granted, it's not as fun as, you know, slashing people to death, but, um, it is still pretty

262
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,480
cool the way you do a lot of the moves.

263
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,840
So, um, in place of, you know, swinging the Wii remote, you actually use the, um, uh,

264
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,840
the right analog stick to do some of those moves.

265
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,160
And same with the wrestling moves and stuff, except you use it with, uh, the left and right

266
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
analog sticks.

267
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,240
Um, but it actually works pretty cool.

268
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,320
The only, uh, gripe I have about it is, um, I mean, the game itself is in English, uh,

269
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,840
the dialogues in English, um, and you have the choice between English or Japanese dialogue.

270
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,640
The problem is they did not sync up the, um, mouth movements to the English dialogue.

271
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,440
It's only synced up to the Japanese dialogue.

272
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,080
And I mean, it is way off for the English dialogue, but, uh, it's a fun game overall.

273
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,800
And, I mean, I've played the original on the Wii, so it's kind of just, uh, rehashed stuff

274
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,440
for me, but, um, I'm enjoying it quite a bit, so hopefully I'll be able to play my way through

275
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
that.

276
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,960
Um, and then I played a little bit on the arcade cabinet, broke out some Marvel vs.

277
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:56,200
Capcom 2 and, uh, Capcom vs. SNK 2, so, uh, that was pretty fun.

278
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,520
I'm sorry to derail you for a minute, Loki, because I do love Capcom vs. SNK as well,

279
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,360
but I need to talk to Jamie for a minute.

280
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Is that glue?

281
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Yes.

282
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
That you're putting down there?

283
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Glue?

284
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Okay.

285
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Jamie's working on an art project.

286
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
It's glue.

287
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Are you putting these pictures on the website, or is this a private thing?

288
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Yeah, I'm gonna do it on the website.

289
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Okay.

290
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,760
So Jamie's working on an art project during the show, which is fine, but she's using a

291
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,760
lot of glue, and I want to remind the listeners, we're in kind of an enclosed space here in

292
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
the studio.

293
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
It's not stinky glue.

294
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,680
So we're all currently inhaling glue during this show, as if we weren't crazy enough.

295
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Right now.

296
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,120
You have to be really close to glue.

297
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,680
Back again in about 15 minutes, and see if all the-

298
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,080
I've got it right under my nose, because I'm holding the damn mic.

299
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Great.

300
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Great.

301
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
You of all people.

302
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,880
And for the record, the stuff that I'm using is Mod Podge.

303
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,920
And looks like a Yoplait yogurt container.

304
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
It does.

305
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
A little bit.

306
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
But not safe for you.

307
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,800
I was like, why are you rubbing yogurt on that?

308
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
So weird.

309
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,920
All right.

310
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,120
Did you have anything else you wanted to say about your gaming week, Loki?

311
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,760
Um, no.

312
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,280
That's basically all I played this week.

313
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,840
I wanted to go back to Final Fantasy 13, but I was talking to my friend who's actually

314
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,560
at the same point in the game.

315
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,040
Actually, his wife already finished Final Fantasy 13, and it's just kind of like...

316
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
It sounds annoying.

317
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:19,000
You know, he's like, ah, the ending sucked, and you know, you just put you back before

318
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,360
the game's over, and you don't really get to see the results of your actions and that

319
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
kind of stuff.

320
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,200
So I'm like, eh, that sounds kind of disappointing.

321
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,240
But I will finish it eventually, so I don't have to play it anymore.

322
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
All right.

323
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,640
That's kind of sad, because I mean, like, 10-2 had a freaking epic ending.

324
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,240
Yeah, I'm curious to see what the ending...

325
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
And 11 had no ending.

326
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,480
Yeah, but you had to suffer through the whole game in order to see that ending.

327
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,840
I will say, though, Final Fantasy related, speaking of 11 and all these other games,

328
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,640
a lot of stuff is leaking out on 14, because the alpha's going on right now.

329
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,200
So if you really know where to look, there's a lot of videos, and even the soundtrack.

330
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,040
And I wish I'd brought it to the show with me tonight, but unfortunately I don't have

331
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
it.

332
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
I'll have to bring it next week.

333
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,920
The alpha's leaked, and it looks really good.

334
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,640
But it does look very 11-inspired, so if you didn't like 11, I don't know.

335
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,360
We'll have to see when the game comes out for real, but it definitely looks interesting.

336
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,160
All right, well, if Logie doesn't have anything else for his gaming week, I'll talk about

337
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,120
my gaming week, which of course was a lot of wow, as usual.

338
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,160
But I also played a brand new game that came out this week on Xbox Live Marketplace.

339
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,760
That's right, Magic Sword Double Impact came out this week.

340
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,800
I think actually they're selling it as another name, I think like Final Fight or some other

341
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
game nobody played.

342
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,600
But no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

343
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,680
Love Final Fight.

344
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,560
I just love Magic Sword more.

345
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:37,500
So I was very excited to hear that the game was being re-put out basically on Xbox Live.

346
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,480
And what I really like that they did with it is that they didn't make it just a freaking

347
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,680
dump of the ROM onto the Marketplace with maybe some slightly enhanced graphics.

348
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,280
Now sadly there aren't really enhanced graphics, like you're not going to get Bionic Commando

349
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,880
Rearmed style graphics suddenly out of Final Fight or Magic Sword, but you do have different

350
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
filters.

351
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,820
In fact, there's this one very interesting, the default mode that you play, it tries to

352
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,920
make the screen look like an old arcade screen.

353
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,400
So like it has a curvature to it.

354
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,880
It's very interesting the way they do it.

355
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,160
And it looks awesome.

356
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,800
I couldn't really play the game that way.

357
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,640
I had to just put it in normal, ROM, no filter, just the way I remember it mode.

358
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,200
Which is nice because that's there.

359
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,600
So for the purists like me or whatever, elitists, whatever you want to call me, my mode is there.

360
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,960
So that makes me happy.

361
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,000
Remix soundtrack is there too.

362
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,560
I believe it was the same team that did Bionic Commando.

363
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Don't quote me on that.

364
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,880
One of the other recent Capcom games did that.

365
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,460
So it has a remix soundtrack and of course Magic Sword, which I played mostly through

366
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,640
the week, was just as great as I remember it many years ago.

367
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,580
And if you've never played Magic Sword before, well first I should say Final Fight.

368
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,960
It is the flagship game no matter if I think otherwise or not.

369
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,440
Final Fight is one of those kind of beat-em-up type of games in the style of Double Dragon

370
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,900
or Ninja Turtles.

371
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,740
But I think Final Fight was, or Streets of Rage I guess if you will, but I think Final

372
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,940
Fight was kind of known for just having a somewhat more memorable characters and some

373
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,360
memorable story.

374
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,680
And I think it was just kind of an iconic sort of arcade game that was out in the early

375
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
90s.

376
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,040
And I know Dark Soccer, myself, and probably Loki I'll remember from growing up in the

377
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
pizza parlor and so forth.

378
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,400
I actually have a Final Fight collection.

379
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,080
I was collecting all of them until that really crappy one came out.

380
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,520
But I have Mighty Final Fight and Final Fight Guy.

381
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,080
It was one of those multi, and I believe, could you do three at once in the arcade?

382
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
I can't remember.

383
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
I can't remember.

384
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
I think most cabinets were only two.

385
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
You had three characters.

386
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Yeah, you had three characters, but I guess you could really only play two.

387
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,200
But what I thought also was neat about both games is that there is a mode where you can

388
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,880
have people, random people on the internet, just drop in at any time.

389
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,560
Like walk up to the machine, put in a quarter basically, and drop into your game at any

390
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
time.

391
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,800
A la Street Fighter IV I guess you could say had a mode like that.

392
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,760
But thankfully it's also very easy to turn that off.

393
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,160
So again, I just say props to the team there at Capcom for not just dumping the ROMs and

394
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,200
putting them out on the marketplace, but really kind of going back and touching them up.

395
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,080
And did they redo the graphics?

396
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
No.

397
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,200
But you know, I think they were able to do a good port economically probably.

398
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,080
This was probably a very economic port that they did, and they're probably going to make

399
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,220
crap tons of money off of it.

400
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,520
So props to Capcom.

401
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,240
And I do approve, especially if you remember Magic Sword and Final Fight.

402
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,440
I think the games are done very well.

403
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,360
I don't think $10 is too much to ask for both games.

404
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,200
I think there's a lot of people that are going to be kind of one or the other.

405
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
I don't know.

406
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm a little bit of both.

407
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,560
I joke that Magic Sword's better.

408
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,520
I definitely fondly remember Final Fight.

409
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,640
But if you never played these games growing up, at least check out the demo for heaven's

410
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
sake.

411
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,120
So there you go.

412
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Let's see.

413
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,120
SalaciousPopInChat says something reminiscent of Magic Sword here.

414
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,920
I recall spending three hours and at least $25 on Magic Sword with my BFF at the arcade

415
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,720
and beating it from scratch and having my BFF take the dark orb at the end from the

416
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,560
final boss instead of destroying it and becoming the new evil whatever.

417
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,960
OMG spoiler!

418
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,960
And my 15-year-old self was pissed and the credits rolled.

419
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,000
I believe that's actually an achievement now.

420
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,240
I believe if you actually take the dark orb at the end, that's the way you get one of

421
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
the achievements.

422
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,440
But yeah, you have to work there from the beginning.

423
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,040
It's not like the Super Nintendo version that let you start on whatever floor you wanted

424
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
to, basically.

425
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,920
Because if you ever played the Super Nintendo one, which is a pretty faithful translation

426
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,800
as was Final Fight, you could start on pretty much any floor.

427
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,920
But not in this one.

428
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,160
You have to start from the beginning.

429
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,520
You can continue and you don't have to do it all in one sitting.

430
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,920
So yeah, props to that.

431
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
But that was really the only new, new game I played this week.

432
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,600
Everything else is kind of something I've talked about before on the show.

433
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,520
So that's going to do it for my gaming week.

434
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,140
Getting into housekeeping a little bit before we start the gaming news tonight.

435
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,240
Not a whole lot tonight for housekeeping.

436
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,360
Just want to plug the Twitter and the Facebook, of course, twitter.com slash o-l-r and we're

437
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,000
also on Facebook as well at Orange Lounge Radio.

438
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,600
Please friend us or tell some of your friends to add us too.

439
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,320
Help us spread the word about our little program because we can't afford to do commercials.

440
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,040
Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

441
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,760
Loki's going to start us off with a little bit of gaming news.

442
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,200
Actually a lot of gaming news surrounding one company, right?

443
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,640
Well it's all kind of tying together and it's all very similar.

444
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,600
So you may remember there was a little bit of suing and countersuing with Infinity Ward

445
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:38,160
and or the ex-heads of Infinity Ward and of course Activision over some non-paid royalties.

446
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,040
Well now they made an announcement that they are starting their own studio called Respawn

447
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,000
Entertainment and they will be partnered with EA.

448
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,360
So kind of almost that, you know, the whole thing was Activision was saying that they're

449
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,040
going to go off and take their brand with them to their own studio, partnered with EA

450
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,040
is sort of true but they're not really taking any brands with them, they're basically going

451
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,460
to be doing brand new games, new franchises and that kind of stuff.

452
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,360
So it's really neat and right now of course the only two members of this new studio are

453
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:21,880
Jason West and Vince Zappanelli and they didn't really give any information other than the

454
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,040
fact that they're hiring.

455
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,160
They aren't, I don't believe, allowed to be hiring the ex-Infinity Ward people.

456
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,280
Those guys have been leaving though, there's actually quite a few people leaving all throughout

457
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,920
the week.

458
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:45,760
Starting off, let's see, we had a few different developers or programmers.

459
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:54,180
We had John Shiring and a senior animator, Bruce Fares, both confirmed that they're leaving

460
00:21:54,180 --> 00:22:01,800
Infinity Ward and then also the lead designer, Mackie McKendlish, has also left the company

461
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,720
as well.

462
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:11,760
There was also some other guys leaving, let's see, some more lead designers, Zeed Reek,

463
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:20,880
Steve Fakuto, and some programmers, Rainn Wilson, or Winson, and, is it Rainn Wilson

464
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
on The Office?

465
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:30,920
No, Rainn Winson and Chris, looks like, Sharubi.

466
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,340
And I guess he was another lead artist.

467
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,860
So they've had a lot of different artists and stuff leaving and whatnot.

468
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:45,280
And of course, to top it all off, Activision, there was one of the execs made a comment

469
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,520
about the conditions that they provide for their studios.

470
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:56,360
And according to Activision, because we have to believe them now, the chief operating and

471
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:04,360
financial officer, Thomas Tipple, spoke to the LA Times company town blog, apparently

472
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,880
this week, saying that a development house still has nearly 100 people, even though they

473
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:17,680
lost about 10, they've built a deep bench and the change of guard will provide an opportunity

474
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,500
for some of the rising stars to put their own stamp on the Call of Duty franchise.

475
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:29,200
And then further, he says that we treat our developers extremely well.

476
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,040
Independent Studio, or I continue, I guess, the Activision's Independent Studio model

477
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,400
allows developers a lot of creative freedom while we take care of the back office stuff.

478
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Unfortunately, that's not exactly how they were painting the picture, so I don't really

479
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,960
know if I'd believe all that.

480
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,480
There's definitely a little bit of he-said, she-said going on.

481
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,560
I think they just need to go on Tyra and work it out, honestly.

482
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
Here's another thing.

483
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
It's like a divorce.

484
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:01,840
There was some comment saying that basically that the studio behind Modern Warfare is dead

485
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,320
from one of the insiders, I guess, at Infinity Ward.

486
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,140
His comment was, they're scared shitless.

487
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,900
They never saw this coming, and he's referring to Activision, they can't believe what's going

488
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
on.

489
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,000
At first, they gave us some bullshit about moving up payments, all the money that they

490
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,640
owed us to sooner increments.

491
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:30,520
That was when the designer Todd Aldermen and engineer Frank Galletti left.

492
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,820
But then the announcement of Respawn and then all the people leaving, they just got their

493
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,200
heads in their hands.

494
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Basically he was also saying that apparently the morale's really low and that he thinks

495
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,400
that the studio's going to continue to crumble.

496
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,160
Although there was another insider, I guess, that's kind of painting a more positive picture.

497
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,560
First off, yes, it's a shitty situation, but there's two kinds of people left.

498
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,680
Ones that are sticking it out for the money and the others who want to make something

499
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,760
work.

500
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
We are not dead.

501
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,280
We definitely lost the original team members, but not all the talent.

502
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,140
When you talk about people who left, they are the best in the business, but equally

503
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,100
everyone in Infinity Ward deserves that same credential.

504
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:21,420
We are here for the long haul of keeping Modern Warfare name alive, but as the article clearly

505
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,640
shows, certain people are still pissed about it.

506
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,420
We just had a discussion in our Monday meeting.

507
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,600
We still have talent that will get us to where we need to go, and now it's time to find our

508
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,680
new leader.

509
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:40,040
You know how I'd like to see this whole thing resolved?

510
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:47,040
How?

511
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,120
This is the play tip.

512
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,680
Bobby Kotek, CEO of an Evil Empire video game company.

513
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:00,440
He's accused of being a douchebag who doesn't know how to run his studios, but he says he

514
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,240
knows how to run them just fine and gives them the perfect environment to make games

515
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
in.

516
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Wait, didn't he be the defendant?

517
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Oh yeah, he'd be the defendant.

518
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Ah, I screwed it all up.

519
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Never mind.

520
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
That's why I'm not a lawyer.

521
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
I'm just, I'm Shmo on a video game show.

522
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,680
But no, I mean, this is all, it's very interesting how this is all playing out in public.

523
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,120
Yeah, um, I, I don't know.

524
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,040
The problem I see is, you know, they're saying one, well Activision's saying one thing, how

525
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,080
they, you know, give their studios creative freedom and stuff.

526
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,080
And then at the same time we see the Call of Duty franchise split between three studios

527
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
now.

528
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,240
And the, you know, all this, the reasoning why they wanted to leave, or I guess were

529
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,960
made to leave, is because they wouldn't, you know, they didn't have that creative freedom

530
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,640
and they refused to, I guess, go along with what their plans were.

531
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,680
So I don't know.

532
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,400
It just sounds like a big mess and unfortunately, I think Activision might suffer a little bit

533
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,320
for it.

534
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,200
Tiger Claw says this needs the law and order gavel.

535
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,760
There you go.

536
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:11,080
Um, I don't know, I, I saw a video a couple days ago and I, I thought you were gonna get

537
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,920
to it, but I guess maybe you didn't see it, that showed this, the credits of Infinity

538
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,220
Ward and it just shows how the red lines through all the people that have left.

539
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,100
And while there does seem to be quite a few people that are still there, it's like kind

540
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,560
of like a lot of the testers and sort of the, like, I hate to use insulting words, but kind

541
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,840
of like the lower entry level positions seem to mostly be the ones that are still there.

542
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,440
And then like most of the higher up, so are like out and you got to really wonder what

543
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,640
the longterm impact is going to be.

544
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,520
I mean, you know, Modern Warfare 2 is a huge game and whereas, you know, I'm sure they'll

545
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,160
be, I mean, they got, Activision got another studio to make Guitar Hero 3.

546
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Well let me put it this way.

547
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,320
So somebody else will do Modern Warfare, but it's definitely going to be different.

548
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,960
Yeah, they're going to still have Call of Duty games, I mean, look at World of War.

549
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,680
Yeah, it didn't sell as well as Modern Warfare did, but it still sold really well and that's

550
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,920
Treyarch for you.

551
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,320
They're going to give it to Treyarch and then whoever the hell this new company is, um,

552
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,040
they're going to kind of split it up and fortunately it's never going to be as good, I guess, as

553
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,920
the Infinity Ward games.

554
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,320
And you may still see, you know, Infinity Ward continue on, but I have a feeling there's

555
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,560
going to be a lot more people leaving and especially if they drag this out long enough

556
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,440
and not, and they are not paying their employees, you know, the royalties that are due, you'll

557
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,720
probably see a lot of these people that are, you know, kind of sticking out, start to question

558
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
whether they're going to leave or not.

559
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,880
So I have a feeling this is just going to keep on going.

560
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,880
It's going to be very interesting to see, uh, what kind of game comes out this Christmas

561
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,560
if there is a Modern Warfare game at all.

562
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,520
I imagine there's got to be, but I'm just interested to see what, how it's going to

563
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
be different.

564
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,640
You know, it's just going to be another Call of Duty game.

565
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,080
I thought they were working on a Vietnam one or something like that.

566
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Hmm.

567
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Oh yeah, that's right.

568
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
Cause every other year, huh?

569
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Yeah.

570
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,480
And all they're going to do is just use the same engine that, um, Infinity Ward created,

571
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,240
but Treyarch will be the one putting together the game.

572
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,440
So it'll be another World of War.

573
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,520
And what happens to the, uh, former employees?

574
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,720
Do you think some of them are banding together to form a new studio and what will they make

575
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
games like?

576
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,600
Um, actually the people they're leaving are not going to that Respawn Entertainment.

577
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,440
I think mainly because it's part of the closet.

578
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,960
They can't hire those people.

579
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Oh.

580
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,840
Um, you know, right now it's a non-compete thing, but it's got to be good on the resume.

581
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,160
I worked on the greatest selling fucking video game of the past few years, you know, that

582
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:29,160
and the fact that non-compete clauses in California actually I don't think are valid from what

583
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
I've read.

584
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
So.

585
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Interesting.

586
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,760
I'm not, um, certainly I'm not a lawyer.

587
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,880
I can't even tell the difference between a plaintiff and a defendant, but I mean, there's

588
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,960
a lot of development studios in like Canada and stuff.

589
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,280
I mean, would that water if they, I don't know, but up north, we'll find out what's

590
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
going to happen.

591
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,960
They'll just all play on doing the accusation.

592
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,280
I know that I was just, I was ad libbing earlier when he ad lib, you say stupid things sometimes.

593
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,200
So anyhow, but yes, the plaintiff is the one doing the suing and the defendant is the one

594
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,800
that, not that I've ever had to be a plaintiff or defendant, but I did.

595
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,080
I was on a jury once years ago and, and it was, it definitely played out like an episode

596
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
of law and order.

597
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,240
It was, uh, it was interesting.

598
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Anyhow, plaintiff.

599
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
No, no, no, no, no.

600
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,880
I was thinking of Jay.

601
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
All right.

602
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,080
Look, uh, moving on to other stories that, uh, have a little less to do with, um, the

603
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,520
shakeups and so forth, but a little more, well actually no, this, this is about a different

604
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,840
type of shakeup and very much about television.

605
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,720
Um, I'm sure a lot of you guys that listen to this program also kind of follow a lot

606
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,160
of the other type of, um, you know, nerdy news, if you will, on the internet.

607
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,840
And I'm sure a lot of you are big fans of Conan O'Brien, um, although there's probably

608
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,120
some of you that, that dish out the haterade when it comes to Conan O'Brien as well.

609
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,680
So love him or hate him, Conan O'Brien of course found a new home this week on TBS and

610
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,680
ironically going to be bumping George Lopez back an hour.

611
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
It was his idea.

612
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Yes.

613
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,280
But, but the difference is George Lopez was like, no, no, I want you to do that.

614
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,500
I would be better off with you coming over here.

615
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,480
So cool beans, Conan O'Brien will be back on TV for those that like him and for those

616
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,860
that don't, then you can watch whatever you want.

617
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,480
But the interesting part about this, I mean that part doesn't have anything to do with

618
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,460
video games, but now more, now that a deal has been signed, more news is coming out about

619
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,880
some of the other deals that were presented to Conan.

620
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:22,560
Cause of course when he left NBC, it really seemed like everybody, but like CBS and ABC

621
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,740
was throwing something at him because obviously CBS, ABC have their own lineups, but everybody

622
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
was throwing something at him.

623
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,760
We all know Fox was in negotiations.

624
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,180
I think they came out and said, um, one of the other TV stations was, was in talks with

625
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,280
him as well.

626
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:41,480
But what is very interesting as well, um, team Conan was thinking actually of one idea

627
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,800
way outside the network box.

628
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:49,680
There was actually discussions with Microsoft about an Xbox deal for Conan show that would

629
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,240
have broken new ground.

630
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,000
Now they don't obviously say a lot of specifics about what that deal would have entailed,

631
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,680
but you can sort of connect the dots here and think about, okay, well we all know Xbox

632
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,880
sells TV shows, if you will, I mean that's part of the business they're in.

633
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,760
They sell movies and TV shows and we've seen what's happened over at Sony's camp with the

634
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,560
tester show, which by the way recently ended and I stopped watching it halfway through

635
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,760
and had it spoiled for me on the internet who won.

636
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,840
But if you watched even the first episode of the show, you could see who was going to

637
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,640
win that show coming from a mile away.

638
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,400
But anyway, that's not the point, despite the fact whether the tester was a good or

639
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,680
bad show, whatever your opinion is on that.

640
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,560
It did set this really interesting precedent and I said this a few weeks ago when I first

641
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,440
reviewed the show is that, okay, maybe the tester is a little bit of a wonky show, but

642
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,720
it's still fascinating that there is this budget, there is money, there is drive, there

643
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,040
are embedded commercials and there's ways to make money off direct to PlayStation network

644
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,000
types of TV shows.

645
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,520
And even though the tester might be weird, it's really interesting to see what could

646
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,960
maybe come next out of this.

647
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,080
Well, you now look at what you hear about what's going on over with Microsoft and the

648
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,400
deal they offered and you could kind of think maybe Microsoft was going to do some type

649
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,680
of free show or ad supported show or who knows, maybe they would have sold certain types of

650
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,840
the formats of the show or whatever of Conan O'Brien like every night.

651
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,640
What's also interesting, and when I was first telling a friend of mine about this, he said,

652
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:30,100
is this maybe like one versus a hundred was on Xbox?

653
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,120
And I was thinking, well, that would be really interesting too, is that what if the whole

654
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,040
show had actually played out live on Xbox network and you could watch the show live?

655
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,800
I mean, if you think about it, Microsoft has the bandwidth to make something like that

656
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,520
happen and they have the resources to do it.

657
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,160
I mean, isn't it really only a matter of time before you could get live television through

658
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
your Xbox?

659
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
I mean, Netflix and everything.

660
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:58,840
And it makes sense because a lot more people are playing games versus watching TV.

661
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,680
Even though the Conan O'Brien deal fell through or whatever and Conan decided to go with,

662
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,480
you know, I want to say traditional TV, but that's not really the case.

663
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,520
He went with basic cable, but still, you know, a more traditional type of format.

664
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,000
It's very interesting to see that, okay, well, Microsoft's pursuing these types of ideas

665
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
then.

666
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,640
So what might happen in the next year or so?

667
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,360
Is it possible we're going to see a live interactive talk show?

668
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,600
I think that would be a very logical place for Microsoft to go.

669
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,560
Can you imagine, let's take the nerd angle on it.

670
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,520
Instead of something more like late show type of programming, what if Xbox had a program

671
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,400
like the screen savers?

672
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,880
And I'm not talking what it turned into years later, but old school Leo Laporte, tech TV

673
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,720
screen savers that was interactive with the Xbox audience.

674
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,760
Here's my problem with that and it's just, and it goes for anything even on like the

675
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,160
PlayStation Network or Wii or whatever.

676
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,520
Any of those shows are going to be obviously biased towards one console platform and it

677
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,160
just to me would seem like someone just shoving an advertisement in my face.

678
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,120
You know, basically that's how I even look at like the tester and stuff.

679
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Oh, okay.

680
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,560
It's a giant commercial for your fucking games.

681
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
Awesome.

682
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,400
You know, same with the, you know, I didn't think, you know, and I got to give the tester

683
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
credit.

684
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,520
I mean, yeah, the show had flaws and had plenty of flaws, but it wasn't terrible.

685
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,540
I think a lot of people judge that show without ever watching it for even five minutes.

686
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,760
And I'll tell you what, the production values on the show were not terrible.

687
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
Could it have been better?

688
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
Yes.

689
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,040
But what is it like the worst thing that ever happened to PlayStation Network?

690
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,180
Not at all.

691
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,920
In fact, it does set an interesting precedent where, okay, it is viable.

692
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,880
They embedded commercials in the show.

693
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,440
Granted, you could fast forward them, but I bet there's a way they could get around

694
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
that.

695
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,880
I mean, they embedded commercials in the content.

696
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,520
I mean, yeah, Loki, it was kind of a commercial for some of the games and it's more of, I

697
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,440
would say it's more of like a Sony product, whatever.

698
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,240
But doesn't Microsoft kind of do the same thing when they, whenever they do their Major

699
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,940
Nelson at PAX East, they're showing crackdown, they're showing the Microsoft stuff.

700
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,140
They're not going to say, hey, we were at PAX East this week and oh, APB is here.

701
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,940
You don't really see that on the Microsoft content.

702
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,940
You know what I mean?

703
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,960
You do expect there's going to be that certain type of synergy.

704
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,360
And I don't know, watching the tester, I didn't feel like the game stuff was shoved down my

705
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
throat.

706
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:32,760
I kind of felt like, okay, I'm watching a show about video game testers or whatever.

707
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,560
And you know, you kind of expect there's going to be video games involved and I'm not suddenly

708
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,040
going to see them playing the Nintendo Wii on a Sony PlayStation show.

709
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Right?

710
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Yeah.

711
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
So.

712
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
But that's my point though.

713
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,120
I mean, it's just, I don't know, I mean, I guess if you want, you know, product stuff

714
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:56,200
shoved into your face and you're going to subscribe to their online magazine, but it's

715
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,180
just, I don't really want to see that now if they actually brought the screensavers

716
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,280
as the screensavers were to the network, then yeah, that would be fine.

717
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,120
But it's not going to be that way.

718
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,420
It's going to be kind of biased and that's not something I'm really interested in.

719
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,440
I see what you're saying, because there would be an Xbox or a Microsoft centric spin on

720
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
it.

721
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,720
You're not going to see Macs and things like that on the Xbox screensavers.

722
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,840
Because it wouldn't be like, yeah, I bought my 360 and it died four days later, you know.

723
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,320
You know, come to think of it, sorry to cut you off, but doesn't Microsoft kind of have,

724
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,240
I mean, I think of, and I don't know if this is still around, but I'm thinking, okay,

725
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,240
because we're sort of relatives, we're like distant cousins of this, okay?

726
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,120
So All Games Network is the network we're on, right?

727
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,520
Who is run by Scott Rubin, right?

728
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,680
And Scott used to be on a TV show on G4 called G4 TV, right?

729
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm playing like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon here, right?

730
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Okay.

731
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:01,720
Scott hosted with, Laura Foy was one and the other girl was Tina, not, I keep wanting to

732
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,500
say Tina Fey, but it's not that, it's, oh gosh, I'm going to, I'm going to get yelled

733
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:10,320
at by the chat room for not knowing this, but these two gals hosted the show with Scott.

734
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,640
After the G4 TV thing folded, that show, they went on to do some Microsoft centric show,

735
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,160
like 10 something it was called.

736
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,100
I know there's going to be, there's people that have listened to allgames.com for years

737
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,640
that are going to jump in here and yell what it is in our chat room at chat.com.

738
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,120
But Microsoft is doing a show like that, or was at one time, like they did these little

739
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
specials.

740
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
Tina Wood.

741
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
Thank you, Tina Wood.

742
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,840
And they were doing these little specials for some time that weren't available on Xbox

743
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,040
per se, but it was on like Microsoft's website and they were all about like, you know, fun

744
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,800
features of Microsoft and going out to the, you know, uh, shows and so forth and showing

745
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,200
what's going on.

746
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,520
Because another point I just wanted to say, if there was a Conan centric show on Xbox

747
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,040
or what have you, I don't think it would be restricted to just Xbox.

748
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,320
I think there'd be a way to get it on your Zune.

749
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,600
There'd be a way to get it on your Windows mobile phone and there'd be ways to get it

750
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,240
on your desktop computer, but the technology is certainly there.

751
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
Yeah.

752
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
There you go.

753
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
On 10.

754
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Thank you.

755
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,320
See, I knew, I knew that there's a lot of people listen to us because of the all games

756
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,200
connection and how we kind of joined up with that.

757
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,920
So I knew some of them have been following, uh, Scott and the old G4 family for years.

758
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,620
And yeah, uh, Tiger Claw reminds us, uh, uh, uh, Diane Mazzotta from the old G4 TV days

759
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:30,520
is now on Scott's new show, the Apidae TV, which I watched the iPad special.

760
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,480
It was a pretty good every day though.

761
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,680
That's, that's going to be a lot of work, app a day, one app a day, an app a day keeps

762
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,040
the, uh, Microsoft away, a doctor away.

763
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
I don't know.

764
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
All right.

765
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Anyhow.

766
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,400
Um, so I think it's very interesting.

767
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
This whole Conan thing.

768
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,760
I mean, I can see why it didn't work out, but it does kind of leave a very interesting

769
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,680
door open to what might happen in the future.

770
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,480
So we'll see anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news.

771
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Dark Sakura.

772
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Why don't we?

773
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,320
Um, you know, we brought up, uh, Final Fight Double Impact earlier, or I'm sorry, Magic

774
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,440
Sword Double Impact, Rob, and, um, well the soundtrack is available.

775
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:22,340
You can download, um, the, uh, the remix soundtrack, um, as done by Simon Viklund, um, the guy

776
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,040
who also did the score for Bionic Commando Rearmed.

777
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:33,120
Um, I will be, um, of course linking, uh, that in the chatroom, but you can also find

778
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,320
it at FinalFightGame.com slash remix.

779
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,500
So go, go get it.

780
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
Love Final Fight music.

781
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,120
I also think it's pretty cool that he's just putting it up there for free.

782
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,280
I like that these video game companies are, uh, putting up soundtracks for free, but they're

783
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,120
not the only ones, right Dark Sakura?

784
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,000
Uh, don't think so.

785
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Let's see.

786
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,880
Um, yeah, also the God of War trilogy, um, soundtrack is available.

787
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,160
And uh, of course, uh, I think that's pretty cool that Sony's doing that for God of War

788
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
3.

789
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,320
Um, actually I'm sorry, the whole trilogy, if I'm right.

790
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
I think so.

791
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,560
It's the whole, and God of War is one where they could probably sell it if they wanted

792
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,560
to.

793
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
They did.

794
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
They did?

795
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Yeah.

796
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
They're giving it away for free?

797
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,560
For God of War 3.

798
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
Oh, interesting.

799
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,560
Huh.

800
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,700
But yeah, um, you can actually just go to God of War dot com and I think that it's available,

801
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,040
um, on the website.

802
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,200
I'd be more interested in a dump of the, um, heavy metal soundtrack that they had for,

803
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,600
uh, God of War 3.

804
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,520
I'm kinda surprised we don't see more game soundtracks out there.

805
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,740
I mean, not necessarily for free.

806
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,400
The Blood and Metal EP?

807
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,520
But you know, I'm talking about, like, even on iTunes.

808
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,960
And there, well, I should say that I have seen, there's definitely been an increase

809
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,000
of game soundtracks available on iTunes, but you know, one of these game soundtracks are

810
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,800
really just promotion for the game at the end of the day, so why not give them out for

811
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
free?

812
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Well, I linked it in the chatroom too.

813
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
There you go.

814
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Good job.

815
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,080
Um, also, uh, just wanted to say real quick, uh, we had a little bit of stream downtime.

816
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
I don't know.

817
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,080
We had a stream hiccup that happened.

818
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,980
We just kept right on rolling the tape, but, uh, our live listeners are just now coming

819
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,720
back on and, uh, there's some, uh, chat comments from before the hiccup and I wanted to get

820
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
to some of these.

821
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,320
Uh, Black Wolf in our chatroom, of course, the one and only Bobby Black Wolf who tapes

822
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,280
before us at All Games Radio, he said, I wanted to point out that some of the on 10 stuff

823
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,720
from E3 2007 actually showed people playing Wii games.

824
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,600
I was surprised.

825
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,160
Does that maybe play into the, and I don't want to, maybe I shouldn't go back and open

826
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,520
this old can of worms, but does that maybe play into the whole, uh, conspiracy theory

827
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,640
from about three years ago before the Wii really took off on OMG, Microsoft wants to

828
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
buy Nintendo?

829
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,240
Like that, like, and, and also hasn't they had, didn't they say at one point that maybe

830
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,160
it was Nintendo that said this, I don't know, but somebody said that Microsoft is competing

831
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,720
with Sony, not Nintendo.

832
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,720
Yeah.

833
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,360
So maybe, you know, showing a Wii game is okay, but showing a PS3 game, not okay.

834
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,520
And I could see that.

835
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,280
I don't know.

836
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Anyway.

837
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Sorry.

838
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,480
I just want to say that now.

839
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
I didn't want to.

840
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
Yeah.

841
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
Really?

842
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
Yeah.

843
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,520
Now that Natal's coming out, they probably won't be showing those a week clips anymore

844
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,880
because now they are a little bit more of a competitor.

845
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
We'll see.

846
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,160
Anyway, for the live listeners, we'll play some of the songs from those soundtracks a

847
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,300
little later on during our break.

848
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,360
For those of you listening on the podcast, you will have to go grab those at the URLs.

849
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,840
Dark Sakura already gave you.

850
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
Yep.

851
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,840
Go get them.

852
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,840
All right.

853
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:37,200
Well, um, in case you're wondering, the, um, teased Nintendo 3DS is going to be Nintendo's

854
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,680
next platform, not necessarily just a revision of the current hardware.

855
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,160
It is actually going to be a brand new platform.

856
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,160
And that makes sense considering some of the stories we've talked about, the 3DS or stuff

857
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,040
that could possibly lend itself to the 3DS, like for example, the patent that was registered,

858
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,500
I believe last week for some sort of rumble device built into the new DS.

859
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:04,800
And of course, you know, the fact that the 3DS is going to be in 3D, um, obviously it's

860
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,760
going to be probably backwards compatible with, um, the DSI stuff or the Nintendo DS

861
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
stuff.

862
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,280
Um, so yeah, that makes sense, but that's kind of neat.

863
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,480
So new platform finally for the handhelds.

864
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,440
Um, so in other words, it's not just a DS upgrade.

865
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,800
It's a brand new, it is a new thing.

866
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,600
Basically they're saying that we've run out of ideas for new games.

867
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:35,720
So now we're going to put out a new Mario game and a new, uh, you know, I, I ha I will

868
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,160
say though, I, my interest is piqued with this.

869
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,080
I am very curious to see how this plays out because I am, I'm not big on the 3D thing.

870
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,160
I think it's a little ridiculous for some of the movies.

871
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,160
I mean, yes, avatar was, was pretty, but I mean, honestly the 3D gave me a headache.

872
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,720
I think I would have enjoyed avatar just as much in 2D.

873
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,720
That's what I'm saying.

874
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,720
I mean, was it pretty?

875
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,720
Yeah.

876
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,720
But would I have enjoyed it just as much in 2D?

877
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,720
Of course I would have.

878
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,640
Um, so I'm kind of curious if games are really going to make me feel differently about 3D.

879
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,640
You know, I think I'd pick up the system one step closer to the holodeck.

880
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,440
I, I think it'd be interesting cause I like the fact that it doesn't require, um, glasses

881
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,120
to play it, which is kind of cool.

882
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,560
Yeah, that is very interesting.

883
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,560
And really to be honest with like the 3D TVs and stuff that they're shown on TV, um, I'm

884
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,040
not really interested in that stuff because those glasses are so damn expensive.

885
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,320
I think the best system out there that they should really go with, and I'm very surprised

886
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,720
that they're just going with the actual shutter glasses and stuff, is that real D3D.

887
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,080
Cause those glasses are fucking dirt cheap.

888
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:40,640
I mean, they hand them out for like five bucks when you go see a 3D movie, and it works just

889
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,920
as well as those shutter glasses.

890
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,800
So if they can come up with a TV that supports that, I think that'd be the way to go cause

891
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,640
hell, I mean, you don't have enough for your friends or something, just go buy a pack of

892
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,760
ten for like, you know, twenty bucks or something.

893
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
I don't know.

894
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,120
Um, it's kind of funny, Sega in our chatroom says, holodeck missed.

895
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,080
And if you're new to the show and you've never heard me kind of say, oh, we're one step closer

896
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,360
to the holodeck.

897
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,760
Every time we hear about this new invention in games or the next, you know, generation

898
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,680
of games, cause you know, the show's been on a little while now, when our show started

899
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,240
the PlayStation 2 was still new, okay?

900
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,340
Whenever these new things are announced, it's always kind of like joking, well, we're one

901
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:23,140
step closer to the holodeck, which from Star Trek The Next Generation was, you know, there

902
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:29,820
is no, you basically were in the environment you wanted to be in or play your game or simulation

903
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,820
in.

904
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,520
And I kind of think the one thing I could see that could be very cool about 3D is that,

905
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,440
like, well, I don't even know if cool is the word I would use, but can you imagine, like,

906
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,960
a, not so much on the DS, but like on a big console, a big TV, a 3D version of like Silent

907
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,960
Hill?

908
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,720
Like, I don't even know if I could play a game like that.

909
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,320
I think it just might be too much for me, like sensory overload, you know?

910
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,880
All I have to do is make this technology affordable, cause if that system comes out at $200, that's

911
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,880
not gonna work.

912
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,920
A game like Myst could be, I mean, the reason why I read that quote is because Myst, I don't

913
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,160
know, there's a creepiness to Myst, but not like scary.

914
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,320
There's just certain, like, I don't know, I played Myst online for a couple weeks.

915
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,120
I'd want holodeck phantasmagoria.

916
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,120
You're sick.

917
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,760
But there's a certain creepiness to it without being, like, just downright scary.

918
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,960
Can you imagine 3DF0?

919
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,880
I'd barf.

920
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,880
Like 3DF0 moves, would move very quickly.

921
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,160
F0 is a very fast-moving game.

922
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,160
I'd probably barf.

923
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,600
I think it might be too much.

924
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,840
Here's what I'm surprised, and, you know, we may see this later on, is...

925
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:40,000
Sorry, Tigerclaw in our chatroom, chat.ornsonshade.com says, eh, people will just play WoW and realistic

926
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
3D.

927
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
True.

928
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,640
It's like arcade games with this kind of technology built in, cause it's just an LCD screen with

929
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,240
some sort of, you know, extra screen in front of it that directs the light to your eyes.

930
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,040
You know, that'd be perfect because, like, especially sit-down racing games and stuff,

931
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,080
you're obviously at a certain distance away from the screen that they could calibrate

932
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,920
it to, and there you go.

933
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,720
Yeah, but arcade games, I mean...

934
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,720
But yeah, but...

935
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,480
I don't mean to jump ahead, but I know we have a story coming up later about arcades

936
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,360
further on the decline, and it's kinda like...

937
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,360
I don't know.

938
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,360
That's a lot of money.

939
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,280
But that's the thing though, but the arcade games, yeah, they're not releasing a lot of

940
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,600
stuff, but the stuff that they are releasing are, like, the big things that you can't do

941
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,600
at home type stuff.

942
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,600
I see.

943
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,740
You know, like the, you know, full-scale racing sims and stuff like that.

944
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,260
But just, this would take it one step further, and that would be awesome.

945
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,360
So like 3D Mario Kart in the arcade?

946
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,360
Exactly.

947
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,360
Good times.

948
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,360
All right.

949
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,800
Well, I was talking about sensory overload, and that kinda ties into the next story, and

950
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,040
it's about this study that was conducted by Australian researchers.

951
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,440
And what they're trying to do is kinda refute the claim that if you play violent video games

952
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,680
before you go to bed, you're gonna have a hard time falling asleep.

953
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,880
So what they did is they did this study.

954
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,360
They took two groups of teenage boys, sorry, no girls allowed apparently in this study,

955
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,640
and they made them play 50 minutes of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, or I'm sorry, Call

956
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,160
of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.

957
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,480
They split them into two groups, and one group played Call of Duty 4, the other group watched

958
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,120
March of the Penguins while lying in bed.

959
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,760
And then after 50 minutes, they had to go to sleep.

960
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,300
And what they found out, the group that played Modern Warfare overall only took a few minutes

961
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,940
longer to fall asleep than those that were watching the movie.

962
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,520
That's because it's the March of the Penguins.

963
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,240
They would have fallen asleep during the movie.

964
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Exactly.

965
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
It's boring.

966
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,880
Well, I think the reason why it might take longer to fall asleep is not, it has nothing

967
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,680
to do with the violent content.

968
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,080
I think a more accurate thing would have been play Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare versus

969
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,720
like Super Mario Galaxy or something, or well, maybe that's not the best, or LittleBigPlanet,

970
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,440
you know, something more G-rated in video games.

971
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,920
Because, I think the reason why, you know, even though this whole study is supposed to

972
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,760
show, oh, it doesn't keep you up as late, you know, whatever, I think even the few minutes

973
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,960
were probably because Modern Warfare is more interactive.

974
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,960
You're thinking about it more.

975
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,960
It's more mentally stimulating.

976
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,520
Yeah, it stimulates your mind more than watching a movie.

977
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,100
Isn't quite as mentally stimulating.

978
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,100
Especially March of the Penguins.

979
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:09,320
I mean, my God, why would you torture someone like that?

980
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:13,400
I mean, like, I love penguins, but March of the Penguins, yeah, I was about to go to sleep.

981
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,400
During March of the Penguins.

982
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,400
I preferred Happy Feet.

983
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,400
Thank you very much.

984
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,400
Justino.

985
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,800
No, it's, I mean, I've been like, I want to go to the other group.

986
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,800
So there you go.

987
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,200
But this kind of begs the question, you know, kind of tying into the whole, and I'm asking

988
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,380
this to the chat room as well, so chatters, please voice your mind on this one.

989
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:38,280
Has there been a time where video games have ever impacted your sleep?

990
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,240
I've had dreams about games.

991
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,240
Yeah?

992
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,080
The same way you do about movies, you know, and shows and stuff.

993
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,080
Maybe like-

994
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,800
I've had an interesting Silent Hill dream that I actually wanted to pitch as a game.

995
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
Oh, really?

996
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,840
Yeah, but it would be spoiling the ending.

997
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,280
Okay, well, let me not ask so much about the actual dream itself, but let me see your sleep

998
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,360
habits.

999
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,380
Has video games ever impacted, like, when you go to bed or how late you're staying up

1000
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,380
at night?

1001
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,380
Not really.

1002
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,620
I mean, I have a couple of times gotten caught up in a game, like just playing some Star

1003
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,880
Trek online, and then I'll realize that I've fallen asleep in a battle or something, and

1004
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,880
then I'll just turn it off.

1005
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,880
Nice.

1006
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,720
I've done that once, by the way.

1007
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,400
But I, not really, I mean, I stayed up all night playing Blue Dragon, but my plan first

1008
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,600
was to stay up all night, and I played Blue Dragon to keep myself staying up all night.

1009
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
Right.

1010
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
So-

1011
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,160
I remember when I was younger, I literally stayed up till like 6am in the morning playing

1012
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,720
Super Mario Brothers 2 when I first played it.

1013
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:38,440
Well, I did that, though, with Final Fantasy III over here, Final Fantasy VI.

1014
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,440
So I did that.

1015
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,360
I did it for a week.

1016
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,240
And then World of Warcraft.

1017
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,240
You know, there's been-

1018
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
Addict!

1019
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,160
That raid that keeps you up later than you intended.

1020
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,680
I mean, I'll admit it, it's happened.

1021
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,040
Video games have impacted my sleep.

1022
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,040
How about you, Loki?

1023
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
Is the video game-

1024
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
Final Fantasy XI.

1025
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,000
Used to play with the Japanese folks, and in order to play with the Japanese guys, you

1026
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,160
have to stay up till 5 in the morning.

1027
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,160
I've done that before.

1028
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,160
But-

1029
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,160
And, uh-

1030
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,160
I did it on purpose.

1031
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,160
No, um, no.

1032
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,160
But, see, that's the thing, though.

1033
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,600
That night, that was a conscious choice.

1034
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,800
It wasn't like, oh, games making me stay up, you know?

1035
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,880
And I have to say, though, after I'm done gaming, fell asleep like a rock.

1036
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,400
I mean, it did not keep me up at all.

1037
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,560
I actually find that playing a good involving game before I go to bed, for me, works like

1038
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,840
reading, you know?

1039
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,200
Where it'll kind of help me settle down, because I need to be doing something before I go to

1040
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,880
bed so that I'm not-

1041
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,240
Because if I'm just sitting here going, buh, bored, buh, bored, buh, bored, then I won't

1042
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,880
go to sleep.

1043
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,480
But if I've worn my brain out, then I have no problem going to sleep.

1044
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,440
Really when you get down to the bottom of the study, what is it that they're trying

1045
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,440
to figure out?

1046
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,180
They're trying to figure out whether they can blame games for something else.

1047
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,120
I mean, that's really what it comes down to.

1048
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:56,320
It's like, oh my god, violent video games are bad because they prevent you from sleeping.

1049
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,320
I mean, really-

1050
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,120
Because you just lie there in bed thinking about all the blood you just splattered.

1051
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,120
You're not gonna, like, play the violent video game and go to bed and go, oh my god, someone's

1052
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,720
gonna kill me now, unless you're, like, mentally disturbed, and in which case you shouldn't

1053
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,680
be playing games in the first place, at least that way, and I mean, if games are affecting

1054
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,000
you in that way, don't play them right before bed.

1055
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,400
I mean, come on, take some damn responsibility for yourself.

1056
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,360
We don't need to be funding the- I mean, who did this?

1057
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,480
Obviously, it's somebody funded by somebody else, so that's money wasted right there,

1058
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,640
if you ask me.

1059
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,880
Let's go to our chat room with some comments and answers to the question.

1060
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,800
Do you- have you ever, like, stayed up all night and had your sleep plans impacted by

1061
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,800
a video game?

1062
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,600
Shaoran says, if by impacted your sleep you mean play Final Fantasy X all night, in that

1063
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
case, yeah.

1064
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,560
Dartitsuya says, does staying up till all hours of the night playing Beat Media 2DX

1065
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,560
count?

1066
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,920
Bochikawa says, it has, but I've got sleep issues.

1067
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,000
I sleep for too long and use entertainment to try to regulate hours.

1068
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,560
Rama says, Sky, that was me with Super Mario Brothers 3 and now I'm doing it with Final

1069
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,880
Fantasy XIII.

1070
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,720
You know what I kind of find is that I just have a hard problem falling asleep before

1071
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,460
midnight, period.

1072
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,800
And I don't know if games are to really blame for that, but I just, like, I don't go to

1073
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,560
bed before midnight ever, even if I have to be up at five in the morning, or no matter

1074
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,280
what time I have to be up, I can't, like, force myself to go to bed before midnight.

1075
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,040
Just force feed yourself shows that you don't want to watch, like, for example, reruns on

1076
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,040
the Food Network.

1077
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,400
It'll put you to sleep without you even knowing it.

1078
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,400
But like, I don't know, I can't, like, let myself do that.

1079
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,400
I don't know why.

1080
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
I can't let myself do that either.

1081
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,680
It's not all PM if I really want to.

1082
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,320
But then my wife is leaning on one side, my cat's on my lap, so, you know, it's like I'm

1083
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:40,280
stuck there with my eyes glued open trying to watch the same episode of Divers, or, you

1084
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,480
know, Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and it's like, I've already seen this eight times!

1085
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,480
I don't want to see it again.

1086
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,480
Ah, alright.

1087
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,600
No, but seriously though, everybody is basically saying that they made conscious choices to

1088
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,240
stay up because the game they want to play, you know, was fun.

1089
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,760
Not necessarily that they stopped playing and they couldn't fall asleep because they

1090
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,520
were playing a violent video game, or a video game in general.

1091
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,360
So once again, do we really need this study?

1092
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:11,320
On the same token, I have stayed up late reading a book because I wanted to finish the book.

1093
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,520
I wanted to get to the next chapter.

1094
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,280
I've stayed up watching entire TV series because I wanted to see the next episode.

1095
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,000
I wanted to see what happened next.

1096
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,360
So it's the same thing.

1097
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,640
I was up very late last night watching Mean Girls.

1098
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:31,400
So I'm not lying, I really was up till like 1.30 because we were watching Mean Girls.

1099
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:37,400
I've read books and then fell asleep and started dreaming parts of the book, like, later on,

1100
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,940
and then had to turn in a book report and it didn't come out that well because what

1101
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,440
I dreamt didn't actually happen in the book.

1102
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,360
But it was funny because I didn't know that because I thought I had just been reading

1103
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,160
the book.

1104
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:56,000
Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news and then maybe we'll get some emails

1105
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
on this topic.

1106
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I don't know.

1107
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1108
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,880
I work with weirdos.

1109
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,560
Some more news stories for you guys and then we'll get to the Classic Game of the Week

1110
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,560
in a little bit.

1111
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,840
Well, this is actually something that I ran across completely by accident the other day

1112
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,280
and I'm pretty glad that I did.

1113
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,120
There is an Iraqi video game coming out.

1114
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,760
Developed in Iraq, took 17 years to develop.

1115
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:28,120
It started developing it under Hussein's reign because it was really hard to get in the items

1116
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,320
that they needed.

1117
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,880
Good God, 17 years?

1118
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,880
Is it on the ColecoVision?

1119
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,880
1993.

1120
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:41,760
Rabah Shehab was an engineering student at the University of Baghdad and after the Gulf

1121
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,880
War he wanted to make a video game.

1122
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:53,680
So he started, it was, there had been none made in Iraq so he basically decided to try

1123
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:03,560
to make a fun game and he wanted to, he wanted to counter the bad images of the Gulf War,

1124
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,580
you know, the bombs and everything by showing something that's a little bit more culturally

1125
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,120
deep.

1126
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:18,040
And so according to this he saved up to buy an Amiga in Iraq at the time and had to pirate

1127
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:23,240
games so that he could actually play them and see how they were made and he actually

1128
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:30,600
had to recycle floppies because he couldn't get disk drives or anything.

1129
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,040
Doesn't he know how to copy that floppy?

1130
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:39,760
Well, at any rate, they finished the game and it's about two brothers named Nasir and

1131
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,960
Blasir who went throughout ancient Mesopotamia to fight an evil sorcerer.

1132
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:54,200
And so now the game Babylonian Twins is being published for iPhone and iPod touch, or sorry,

1133
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,680
for iPad and iPhone and I guess iPod touch.

1134
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:03,960
But actually I watched some of the movie of it, the little film of it and it's actually

1135
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,960
pretty cool.

1136
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:12,120
So they basically redid the graphics all high def and added new music, new levels and it's

1137
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,960
actually already on the iPhone so you can go get it.

1138
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,520
And it reached the top 20 in the first week.

1139
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,520
That's kind of neat.

1140
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,800
You know, I really like his inspiration because I think the guy's got a really good point.

1141
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,600
I think there's a lot of people over here, because a lot of us have practically grown

1142
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,600
up on the Gulf War.

1143
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,960
I mean, I know that's a weird way of saying it, but especially the demographic that listens

1144
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,240
to this program in their 20s and stuff have known of the Gulf War since they were kids.

1145
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:44,600
So I think the images we get of Iraq, unfortunately, are bombs, Saddam Hussein when they pulled

1146
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,840
him out of the ground and he looked all like crazy.

1147
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,760
These are the images people have of Iraq.

1148
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:59,800
But there's this whole culture and years of history, a country, land that's been around

1149
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,200
for years and years before any of this was going on and the oil wars and all this stuff

1150
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,800
of culture that people don't really know about.

1151
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:13,720
Well, I want to quote actually the last line of this article because I think that it goes

1152
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,840
along with what you're saying.

1153
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:21,720
This game is just a small creation from what he sees as a vibrant but downtrodden people

1154
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,160
and he hopes that in America it can serve as a small indication of what Iraq is beyond

1155
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,160
a deadly quagmire.

1156
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,560
By the way, and by the way, of all places, I got this at AOL news.

1157
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,560
Hey, nothing wrong with that.

1158
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,560
Yeah.

1159
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,240
So I'm going to link this in the chat room and I'd love for people to watch the little

1160
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,840
trailer that came with it.

1161
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,600
It looks super fun, actually.

1162
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,600
I'm going to download it.

1163
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
It looks kind of Mario-esque.

1164
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:47,320
I'm actually going to download it on iTunes right now and I'll hopefully do a review next

1165
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,320
week.

1166
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,320
Very cool.

1167
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,920
Well, props, props to that guy for, I mean, 17 years is an awfully long time and that's,

1168
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,240
that's a lot of drive to, um, and something you really believe in.

1169
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,520
I mean, if you think about it, we've only been doing this show, which has definitely

1170
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,460
been a labor of love, uh, for what, eight years?

1171
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,960
That's not even half the time it took this guy to make this game.

1172
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,760
Just food for thought.

1173
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,640
It's, to be fair, he didn't spend all that time making the game.

1174
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,640
Okay.

1175
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,460
But still, I mean, he never just let it die, right?

1176
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,460
You know what?

1177
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:26,720
It's, it's three bucks on iPhone and five bucks on the iPad, the HD version on iPad.

1178
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,720
So you know what?

1179
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,920
You can spend three bucks and give it a try.

1180
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,920
All right.

1181
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,920
We'll go look at the trailer.

1182
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,920
See what's up your alley.

1183
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,400
One other thing is that because he had to put, he actually put a lot of expense into

1184
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,840
it because all this stuff was really expensive to get, you know, especially in the times

1185
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,840
that he was in.

1186
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:47,040
So he was actually quoted saying that he doesn't expect to really make back the money he spent

1187
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,160
on it, but it would be nice.

1188
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:53,120
So I, you know, help a guy out, spend the three bucks, you know, let them know that

1189
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,440
his, you know, wasn't in vain.

1190
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,880
All right.

1191
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,200
Well best of luck to the guy in, um, um, selling the application and getting the word out there

1192
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:05,220
that Iraq is, is much more than, than, than, than a war.

1193
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:09,080
I think that's a very good, um, kind of moral, I guess, to the story.

1194
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,080
All right.

1195
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,920
Let's talk about some other games coming out, uh, around the world and some other, uh, parts.

1196
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,520
We'll start here in the U.S. with Loki.

1197
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,720
What's coming out in the U.S. this week?

1198
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,480
Uh, not a lot, but there's some decent stuff.

1199
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,480
Um, start off with Blood Bowl on PSP.

1200
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,280
It's delayed from a few weeks ago, finally, hopefully coming out on, uh, PSP this week.

1201
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,800
Uh, the Classic Controller Pro in both white and black coming out to tie in with, uh, Monster

1202
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,640
Hunter Tri, which will be making its way out on the Wii.

1203
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,200
Um, also All-Star Karate coming to, uh, the Wii as well.

1204
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,640
I guess that's a little bit better than All-Star Cheerleader.

1205
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:52,840
And then finally, um, Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper coming out on, uh, Xbox 360.

1206
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:59,520
Also on the PlayStation Network and Xbox, um, 360 Marketplace this week, After Burner

1207
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:05,360
Climax will be the game of the week.

1208
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,960
I bet, uh, Dark Sakura's gonna, uh, check that out.

1209
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,960
Yep.

1210
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,960
I heard, yeah.

1211
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,960
Damn straight.

1212
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,960
All right.

1213
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,800
Let's go over to Japan and look at the, uh, Japanese release dates.

1214
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,800
Uh, a little bit busier this week than it has been in recent weeks in Japan.

1215
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:25,240
Uh, coming out on the Xbox 360, Ketsuie Kizuna Jigoku Tachi Extra, uh, in regular and limited

1216
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,480
editions on the 360.

1217
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,200
This is a shooter classic from Cave that's getting upgraded for the 360, uh, includes

1218
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,160
networking abilities, uh, where you can play with other people, uh, in a shooter.

1219
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,160
So...

1220
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,160
Cave did Eskebaloo...

1221
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,160
Eskebaloo.

1222
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,160
That's right.

1223
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,860
So, uh, you shooter fans, you SHMUP fans have something to look forward to this week, um,

1224
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,760
and I imagine some folks will be importing that.

1225
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,760
Uh, also on the 360 this week, from Square Enix, Nier Gestalt.

1226
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,160
And that, this is, uh, one of the ones they've been teasing for a little while, right, Nier?

1227
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:57,840
Uh, is this one of the ones that's on the, um, uh, Unreal Engine, as well?

1228
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,680
Um, maybe, I don't remember.

1229
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:05,880
But it is a big new action-adventure RPG series that is coming out over here, what, by the

1230
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,880
end of the year?

1231
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,440
Uh, actually, it's coming out the week after next.

1232
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,760
Oh, wow, so, good, we'll have to wait very long to get it over here.

1233
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,080
But if you want to get it a couple weeks early, the Japanese release is out soon.

1234
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,320
Also, uh, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion is getting its Game of the Year edition finally

1235
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,320
out in Japan.

1236
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,600
It took them a little while to get Oblivion over there, because they have a translated

1237
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,800
version, right?

1238
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,960
And there's a lot of dialogue and so forth in Oblivion.

1239
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,520
I mean, god, talk about a game with depth.

1240
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,420
So they're just now getting around to their Game of the Year edition, like we've had over

1241
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,880
here in the US for a while.

1242
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,640
Uh, same style, same style on the PlayStation 3.

1243
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:43,840
Uh, PlayStation 3 is also getting its own version of Nier, but they call it Nier Replicant

1244
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,840
on the PS3.

1245
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,240
It's almost like, uh, a different game on the 360 and the PS3.

1246
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,440
I'm not sure how that all works.

1247
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,420
Is that like a Pokemon red and blue thing, but it's on different systems?

1248
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,420
I have no idea.

1249
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,420
That's very interesting.

1250
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,960
It could be a side story.

1251
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,960
It could be.

1252
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,960
Sometimes that happens.

1253
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,960
That's very interesting.

1254
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,920
You don't really usually see that in the same week though.

1255
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,880
That's, I'm curious to see how that plays out.

1256
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,080
Uh, the Nintendo Wii does not have any huge games this week, but they have one called

1257
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,180
Ivy the Kiwi.

1258
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,180
That sounds cute.

1259
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,180
Ivy the Kiwi.

1260
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:17,040
This looks a lot like, um, oh, some game I've seen on the, uh, no, I guess it's not that

1261
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,040
same game.

1262
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,040
Oh, it looks cute though.

1263
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,800
I like the art style in this game.

1264
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,800
Looks very cool.

1265
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,920
Uh, imagine like a very hand drawn kind of game, uh, that's coming out on the Wii this

1266
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,920
week.

1267
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:27,920
I like that art style.

1268
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,200
Google that and look at some pictures from that.

1269
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,600
That's Ivy the Kiwi as a question.

1270
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,600
Ivy the Kiwi?

1271
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,440
Uh, PlayStation 2 gets another pachinko game out this week.

1272
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,720
This one, uh, Higurashi no Naku Korom ni Matsuri, but just what you really needed.

1273
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,720
Another pachinko game.

1274
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,720
How about the Nintendo DS?

1275
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,680
Nintendo DS gets its own version of Ivy the Kiwi, uh, but the big release would be Naruto,

1276
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:53,800
Naruto Shippuden Ninjutsu Senkai-Cha Crash comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.

1277
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,960
Yes, it's another Naruto game.

1278
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,960
It's a brand new battle system though.

1279
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:06,720
You fill your chakra gauge as you fight Sasuke, Itachi, or Dodara, whatever, uh, if you're

1280
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,960
a fan of Naruto, I'm sure you already have that on import and, uh, on the PSP, actually

1281
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,680
some big, big releases on the PSP this week, Knights in the Nightmare comes out and I think

1282
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:21,960
a game that a lot of folks are going to be into on the PSP, Disgaea Infinite comes out.

1283
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,960
That's right.

1284
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,600
Disgaea on the PSP with infinite possibilities.

1285
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,440
Let's go over to the UK.

1286
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,440
Dark soccer.

1287
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,440
I was covered in glue.

1288
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,440
Sorry.

1289
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,440
Still sniffing the glue over there, huh?

1290
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,520
No, I'm working on the back end of my thing now, so I'm almost done with my decoupage.

1291
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,520
I love that word.

1292
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:48,360
Anyway, um, on the 20th we have, um, the misadventures of PB Winterbottom, and that actually makes

1293
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:54,040
me sad because of one of my co-workers, except for the middle initial, those are his last

1294
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,680
name and first initial, so it actually made me think about him.

1295
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,680
Interesting.

1296
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:04,440
I hope it doesn't have anything to do with him, um, um, and Vigilant Chronicles, an MMO.

1297
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:12,000
21st Afterburner Climax, woohoo, and, um, the 23rd Dead to Rights Retribution, Monster

1298
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,120
Hunter Tri, Nier, and the Whispered World.

1299
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,720
That's a cool name, the Whispered World.

1300
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,720
That's it.

1301
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,480
That is a nice name.

1302
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,480
Whispered World.

1303
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,480
The Whispered World.

1304
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,480
Whisperer.

1305
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,480
Makes me think of Wispy Woods.

1306
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,480
How was the stage?

1307
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,320
Anybody know where Wispy Woods comes from?

1308
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,320
Kirby's Avalon.

1309
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,320
Good job!

1310
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,320
You get a gold star.

1311
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,320
You have that game.

1312
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,560
When you go to the level it goes, Wispy Woods.

1313
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,480
You are a classic game sponge, I love it.

1314
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,320
Kirby's Avalanche was like my game until I discovered it was Puyo Puyo.

1315
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,600
I was like, Puyo Puyo.

1316
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,680
Kirby's Avalanche was my game and I never discovered it was Puyo Puyo until, seriously,

1317
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,920
this show, and interacting with you and your sponge of import game knowledge.

1318
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,840
You know what else was Puyo Puyo, right?

1319
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,840
The Dr. Robotnik.

1320
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,040
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.

1321
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,040
Oh yeah.

1322
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,900
And I think a lot of people always wondered back in the day, like, how come the same damn

1323
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:08,440
game is out on the Genesis and the Nintendo, but they use the different franchises?

1324
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,600
Like, that was kind of weird to see back then.

1325
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,600
Anyhow.

1326
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,040
It was just to get those games to sell in the US, just put a big game on them.

1327
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,040
Did it work?

1328
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,040
I think so.

1329
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,040
I mean, the Kirby's Avalanche was great.

1330
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,040
Yeah, it was.

1331
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,720
And actually, the digitized voice in it was really well done.

1332
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,720
Wispy Woods.

1333
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,280
Anyhow.

1334
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,280
Talk about random.

1335
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,280
Hi, Loki.

1336
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,280
What's on deck next?

1337
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:35,160
Well, apparently the US government has asked Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to create a game

1338
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,000
about balancing the budget.

1339
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:47,160
Yes, apparently Erskine Bowles, co-chair of President Obama's fiscal commission, is trying

1340
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,160
to...

1341
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,160
Say that ten times faster.

1342
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:54,760
Is trying to create a game to educate the public about the difficulty of reducing the

1343
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,640
US budget deficit.

1344
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:07,800
So basically, they're trying to create a game to show you that balancing the budget is hard!

1345
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:14,800
And the joke, of course, goes that anybody who is able to balance the budget will immediately

1346
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:21,920
be whisked away to some secret government location a la Last Starfighter to balance

1347
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,000
the real budget.

1348
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,640
It's budget mama.

1349
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,640
Don't worry.

1350
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,640
Mama will fix it.

1351
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:33,560
But why spend money to say that, oh, my job is hard, I can't do this.

1352
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,720
I mean, it just sounds like whining to me.

1353
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,880
Budget mama for President 2012.

1354
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,000
And the other way you can look at it is like, well, we don't know how to do it.

1355
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,560
Do you guys have any ideas?

1356
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,040
I mean, really?

1357
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,900
I thought, and granted, I didn't read the story.

1358
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:51,120
I just thought from looking at the title we're putting together tonight's thing, because

1359
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,120
you know what we're talking about.

1360
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:56,040
I don't like to spoil myself, because I like to kind of have topics unfold on air here.

1361
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,660
But I kind of thought when they talked about a game about balancing the budget, I kind

1362
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,000
of thought it would be like personal budget.

1363
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,560
Like teach kids at a young age how to not spend more than they make and maybe like how

1364
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,600
to save a little bit and so forth.

1365
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,020
That would seem like the game to make, right?

1366
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:19,280
Like an Oregon Trail, but with the, you know, you don't spend too much on the wagon wheels

1367
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:23,880
because then you won't have enough for food unless you take a lot of guns with you because

1368
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,440
you can shoot buffalo and have 999 pounds of food.

1369
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:32,640
And in case you didn't think that, you know, the Obama campaign is out of it enough, they

1370
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,260
thought that, you know, what you could get is support among the populace for an exceptionally

1371
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:42,560
unpopular thing that you need to solve this problem.

1372
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,280
And also saying that the game could go viral.

1373
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,280
Wow.

1374
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,440
Way to use buzzwords that you have no idea what the meaning are.

1375
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,120
Like Super Chick Sisters and the other PETA games and how viral they went.

1376
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,120
Viral.

1377
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,120
I'm sorry.

1378
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,360
It has to be good for it to go viral.

1379
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,760
Well, actually it has to be popular for viral.

1380
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,880
No, I mean joystick Kotaku and all those kids will report on it and people will play it

1381
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,140
for like a day and then they'll be like, LOL and then never played again.

1382
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,680
That's what happens with a lot of these, like the PETA games.

1383
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,160
Same thing, right?

1384
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:14,160
People, people look at them, play them once, go LOL and then that's it.

1385
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:18,520
Honestly, I actually think that you touched on something earlier that might actually be

1386
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,520
legitimate.

1387
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,040
Um, Matt did.

1388
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,680
There's also an A plus genius comment in chat I want to get to in just a minute.

1389
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,680
Okay.

1390
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:31,840
I really do think that perhaps the whole point behind this is to trick people into actually

1391
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,280
playing it to get new ideas.

1392
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:39,080
Cause seriously, it's like I put it in the same category and I'm being serious as America's

1393
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,880
army.

1394
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,520
You know, picking interest on who would want to be a soldier, who would want to do this,

1395
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,140
you know, getting a realistic point of view.

1396
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,180
This is giving a realistic point of view to people because who knows, there may be some

1397
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:55,760
genius mathematician out there who might just be able to be a good advisor and do it.

1398
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,800
Yeah, but these people are hired for this job.

1399
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,400
This isn't like who wants to be a millionaire.

1400
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,040
You can't fucking poll the audience for an answer.

1401
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,880
I mean, what is going on?

1402
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,060
Is that the previous way of doing things hasn't worked.

1403
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,880
There's people who can't do it even though they are trained.

1404
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,400
They're trained to think in a particular way.

1405
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,400
So you get people who think differently.

1406
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,720
And maybe I'm taking your comment in the wrong context and running another way in it, but

1407
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,200
could it be then that you're saying maybe this act, I mean, I don't think this is what

1408
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:29,720
you're saying, but kind of of that comment, maybe this is a way to tell kids balancing

1409
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,140
the budget is hard and think about how you spend your own money because balancing the

1410
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,360
government budget is next to impossible.

1411
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,600
No that's not what it is.

1412
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,600
No.

1413
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,560
Well I know that's not what it is, but I think it makes sense in that light.

1414
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,840
But seriously, I think what it is, is a way to tap an untrained mind.

1415
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,080
You know what I mean?

1416
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:52,160
You could find something, you know, because I know people who are freaking math prodigies

1417
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:57,720
who don't really, aren't into the politics behind it, who would say, you know, yeah,

1418
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,600
I'm not attached to the government office.

1419
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,000
Here's what I would do without having to have all of those stressors of, oh, lobbyists this,

1420
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,240
lobbyists that, we want this, we want that, we want this, we want that.

1421
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:19,000
I mean, keep in mind the benefit of getting an, I would have to say an unfiltered perspective.

1422
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,880
Getting fresh eyes to look at something, I mean, that is legitimately a unique way of

1423
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,880
doing it.

1424
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,560
I mean, it's one thing to just go out and pull a bunch of people who you know to be

1425
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,440
talented in it, but another thing to put it out under the pretenses of a game and let

1426
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,960
people work on it without having a real attachment to it and see what creative solution they

1427
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,440
come up with.

1428
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,920
A better sim would be for them.

1429
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,320
It's so crazy, Jamie, it might be true.

1430
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,480
Like that's my thought.

1431
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,080
And again, keep, keep in mind, keep in mind, I, I'm coming from the point of view where

1432
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:54,320
a, okay, keep, and the design point of view, let's put it this way.

1433
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,320
You've got all these people who are trained to do, oh, we use Helvetica for this, we do

1434
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,280
Swiss design, we do this, we do that.

1435
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:07,300
The FedEx logo was created by an intern, you know, just some new kid who came in.

1436
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,300
So think about that.

1437
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:14,160
You know, you get that fresh perspective, you get someone who's not bogged down by just

1438
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:20,640
the weight of the industry, you know, in this case by the weight of politics.

1439
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,640
Where could they go?

1440
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,640
Ironically enough, I don't like talking about my day job a lot on this show, but I know,

1441
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,500
you know, I did mention I just started a new day job this past week actually.

1442
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,980
And I think part of what they're looking for me to me to bring to this position is a fresh

1443
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:33,980
perspective.

1444
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:37,240
That's a, that's a big part of like, you know, why I'm doing the job I'm doing.

1445
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,080
So it's interesting that you kind of tie that together.

1446
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,000
Well, if they want a fresh perspective, vote these people out of office.

1447
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,440
These people were not voted into their job.

1448
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,440
They were elected.

1449
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:52,240
Well, we can take care, we can take care of the people that put them there.

1450
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,920
I really think you're completely missing the point.

1451
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,640
But I worry that the people that would jump up and say, I'll do the job instead are not

1452
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,440
the ones that should be doing it either.

1453
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
You know what I mean?

1454
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,400
I'm looking at this as a consultant, someone who will provide the fresh perspective, someone

1455
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,880
who will give the ideas and then let the people who are trained, who see the big picture actually

1456
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,880
run with it.

1457
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,880
I think it's brilliant, honestly.

1458
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,680
I really do think it's very intelligent.

1459
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:21,640
And I'm, you know, especially if our president is backing, supports the idea, then I'm very

1460
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,640
glad I voted for him.

1461
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,120
Well, just so you guys know, it isn't the first time that they've tried this.

1462
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:31,560
Apparently in 1989, the National Economic Commission distributed hard choices on floppies

1463
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,400
for $20 a copy.

1464
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:43,840
And apparently also the 1994 Commission also released a game with the title Budget Shadows.

1465
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,480
And budget shadows.

1466
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:51,920
And unfortunately, even though those games were released, we still don't have a balanced

1467
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,920
budget.

1468
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,920
OK.

1469
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,160
How many of you got total random tangent?

1470
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,160
But quick poll in studio.

1471
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,040
How many of you guys watch Channel 6 KVIE?

1472
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,320
How many guys watch Channel 6?

1473
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,320
I have.

1474
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,320
What if it's not Channel 6?

1475
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,360
I know this is a Sacramento reference, but whatever.

1476
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,360
It's KVIE.

1477
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,360
KVIE.

1478
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,360
The PBS.

1479
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,960
How many guys ever watch that?

1480
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,960
I have.

1481
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
I have two.

1482
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,560
They show some neat things once in a while on PBS, actually, besides just Sesame Street

1483
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,560
and Mr. Rogers.

1484
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,560
We were bored one night.

1485
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,560
Extremely bored.

1486
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,560
And high.

1487
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,560
And there was nothing.

1488
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,560
No, not high.

1489
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,560
We were so bored.

1490
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,400
And the only thing it was on was a Michael Bolton concert.

1491
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:28,800
And it was like, I don't want to watch this, but seriously, it is the only thing on TV

1492
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,800
right now.

1493
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,400
Hey, well, actually we had a story a couple weeks ago about how Video Games Live was doing

1494
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,040
a thing for PBS.

1495
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,280
That would have been way better than the Michael Bolton concert.

1496
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,440
I saw a Lorena McKinnon concert that was filmed for PBS that was amazing.

1497
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,440
It was amazing.

1498
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:44,520
Although I have to say props to them for being one of the first to have HD.

1499
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,520
So you know.

1500
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,560
PBS introduced me to Doctor Who when I was a child.

1501
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,200
Well, the reason why I bring that up, and I'm not just saying this comment is great

1502
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:57,480
because it's from a friend of mine, but Sagonar Chatroom says, this is why I need to start

1503
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,000
the Corporation for Public Gaming.

1504
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,800
I always found that there was a need for journalistic game development in the vein of the persuasive

1505
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,800
games.

1506
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,040
So while I like the idea of having a budget balance game, but this isn't quite the most

1507
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,320
productive path to make an effective title.

1508
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:17,520
And there's a part of me that goes, why isn't there a foundation for public gaming, a corporation

1509
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,660
like there is for PBS?

1510
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:22,560
This Jazz Jackrabbit was brought to you by...

1511
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,560
Well.

1512
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,560
Yeah.

1513
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,560
Why not?

1514
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,560
I agree.

1515
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,560
Isn't it weird?

1516
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:31,160
But I think there's Flash games that are like that, aren't there?

1517
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,000
It's different.

1518
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,760
And maybe television is different than like Xbox and Wii and all this, but certainly like

1519
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,640
maybe PC games.

1520
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:46,240
It is a little interesting that we don't have more of a, I guess publicly funded game development

1521
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,240
thing.

1522
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,240
Although I guess maybe that's part of what Loki's talking about.

1523
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,240
I don't know.

1524
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,240
It's very interesting.

1525
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:55,040
I just thought, I just kind of read that comment and I went, huh, that's a really good point.

1526
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,720
How come they have it for TV if they don't have it for games?

1527
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,720
Hmm.

1528
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,720
Interesting.

1529
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,560
Anyhow, we've got a couple more stories here and then we're going to get to the classic

1530
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,560
game of the week.

1531
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,760
Uh, I want to talk about Xbox live and crime.

1532
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,160
Do, do, do, do, do.

1533
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,800
Uh, here's the deal.

1534
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,240
What happened is that there was a Connecticut man, just 23 years old, he was out on bail.

1535
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,400
I guess he had been arrested for gun charges, drug charges, you know, all that type of shady

1536
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,400
stuff.

1537
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,480
Apparently he got re-arrested even though he was out on bail.

1538
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,480
Why?

1539
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,040
He sent threatening messages to witnesses on Xbox live.

1540
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:32,880
This all according to the New Haven Connecticut register, uh, Anthony Hayward is his name

1541
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:39,320
and he sent an Xbox live message to one of the witnesses that says, rats die slow.

1542
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,160
And it included the witnesses home address.

1543
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,360
This was back in December, but you know, things take time.

1544
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,600
Can we give him a stupid award?

1545
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,600
Uh, we could.

1546
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,880
You know, what's funny though is that could just be regular Xbox live dialogue if you

1547
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,880
ask me.

1548
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,280
I mean, he might not have actually been there.

1549
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,560
I was just playing call of duty officer.

1550
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,560
Seriously.

1551
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:01,800
This is dark soccer is talking about the stupid award, uh, by the way, uh, just so you know,

1552
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,280
he had been arrested last summer.

1553
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:07,000
Uh, there was a stolen gun under the passenger seat of the car he was driving.

1554
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,520
Uh, apparently the witness said he placed it there.

1555
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,800
He surrendered himself to police.

1556
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,240
He was charged with witness tampering, intimidating the witness and two counts of second degree

1557
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,240
harassment.

1558
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:22,120
The judge set the bail for $50,000.

1559
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:34,160
Idiot, I gotta say though, Xbox live, you know, you don't, it's just another medium

1560
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,360
now it's just as easy as writing an email or whatever.

1561
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,360
All right.

1562
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,240
Dark soccer has got one more story for us and then the classic game of the week.

1563
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,240
Dark soccer.

1564
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,240
Oh yeah.

1565
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:45,820
So, um, you remember me telling you a long time ago about playing descent and having

1566
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:49,680
to have it on 14 discs back in the day?

1567
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:50,680
Yes.

1568
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,760
She had to install three and a half inch floppies, she had to install like 14 disc.

1569
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,760
Please insert this too.

1570
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,760
Please insert this three.

1571
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,760
Yes.

1572
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,120
And my friend who actually I've reconnected with on Facebook recently, my friend Avery,

1573
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,800
um, he built a, he, he modified a chair for descent.

1574
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,520
I thought it was pretty cool.

1575
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,840
It was Uber.

1576
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,840
Awesome.

1577
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,520
Like did the chair move as descent?

1578
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,480
No, but he had like joysticks rigged and key pads and stuff.

1579
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,480
Okay.

1580
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,000
I wonder if he still has it.

1581
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Anyway.

1582
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,440
So Interplay is actually going to be bringing descent to WiiWare and, um, it's being developed

1583
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:31,000
by G1M2 and, um, we'll be using the Wiimote, um, to, uh, move in the game.

1584
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
That's going to be interesting.

1585
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,880
I, I got to tell you, if you have a hard time conceptualizing 3d in your mind, like I know

1586
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,280
a lot of us did when we had to move from 2d to 3d gaming, like part of the reason I struggle

1587
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,240
with Metroid is I can't imagine like just conceptualizing it all in 3d is kind of hard

1588
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:49,760
sometimes like descent will seriously like mess with your mind so hard because it is

1589
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:55,440
full 360 degree movement, but basically, um, well, you know how hard it was to control

1590
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,440
the keyboard.

1591
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,440
I mean, it was a pain in the ass.

1592
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,440
Right.

1593
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,780
And it wasn't that it was a little bit easier with joysticks, but, but all of your movement

1594
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:05,660
then is just going to be intuitive moving through.

1595
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:06,660
You don't have a button.

1596
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,400
It's just moving the sticks.

1597
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,400
So interesting.

1598
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:15,280
And here's what I would propose the reversal head tracking mode.

1599
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:20,600
Could you imagine playing this as a head tracking game, crazy hearing around corners, moving

1600
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,800
forward, backing up.

1601
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,800
That would be crazy.

1602
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,800
Go nuts.

1603
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,800
Too bad.

1604
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,800
It's not going to happen.

1605
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,800
Nope.

1606
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,800
You know, actually it kind of related to that.

1607
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,400
Did you happen to see the link that I put up on my Facebook about the, um, the interactive

1608
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,400
windows?

1609
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,720
I don't think so.

1610
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:42,240
These, these people, and I'll try to find the article again, but these people, um, made

1611
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:47,880
a wall facade and put up windows in it with actually two, um, plasma monitors and, uh,

1612
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,680
uh, uh, Mac.

1613
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:55,720
And um, they did the we moat hack to, and then had like this, a sensor board that you

1614
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,440
could wear around your neck and it would head track the window so you could go to the windows

1615
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,760
and peer through them and go around and, um, oh, sorry, the poltergeist are attacking my

1616
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,760
room again.

1617
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,760
Um, but you could peer in the windows and everything.

1618
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:12,720
I really, really think that that should be where those kinds of games go.

1619
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,720
Hmm.

1620
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,640
Well, will you get, will you check this out?

1621
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,960
I'd throw up, but I think it'd be funny.

1622
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,880
Will you check this out on WiiWare when it comes out?

1623
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,880
Probably.

1624
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,880
Yeah.

1625
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,880
Although I really, and I didn't-

1626
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,880
Did they name a price?

1627
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,880
Or a little early for that?

1628
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,880
Let's see.

1629
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:26,880
Mm-hmm.

1630
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:27,880
Might be a little early for that.

1631
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,880
Yeah, I think it's too early for that.

1632
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,040
But, um, I, I, what I would really like to see though with that is I soup, I hope it's

1633
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:38,560
not pixel like it was, I would really like for them to at least just clean up the pixels

1634
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,560
in it.

1635
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,560
They might.

1636
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,560
Or render it.

1637
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,560
Shit.

1638
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,560
I mean.

1639
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:48,480
Um, before we get into the next segment here, I just want to quickly ask DarkSakura a question

1640
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,040
from a chatter here.

1641
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:54,200
Fun ET man in chat says, good night, but a quick question for DarkSakura.

1642
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:59,360
Which Puyo Puyo is the best for being the most easily obtainable?

1643
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,880
An actual Puyo Puyo?

1644
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,880
I'm sure-

1645
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,880
DS.

1646
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,880
Puyo Puyo DS, probably.

1647
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:05,880
Well, for the US, yeah.

1648
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,280
I would say you can get, um, Puyo Pop.

1649
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,280
Whatever that one was.

1650
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,580
Wasn't there a Puyo Party or something?

1651
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:15,600
There was just a game called Puyo Puyo DS that came out when the DS first came out.

1652
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,600
Yeah, you can-

1653
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,600
It's probably really easy to get and cheap now.

1654
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,600
Probably.

1655
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,120
Um, I, I, but Puyo Pop, you can just get that anywhere.

1656
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:27,760
Um, and it came out on, um, DS and I've actually got a Puyo Puyo that came out on Neo Geo Pocket

1657
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,280
Color a while back.

1658
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,760
If you're looking for an import, though, I don't know.

1659
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:41,080
I got, I have, uh, um, the PC Engine Duo version, which my friend picked up for, you know, 900

1660
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,080
yen in Japan.

1661
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:45,940
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but just go get a Super Nintendo emulator and download

1662
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:48,940
Kirby's Avalanche.

1663
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:49,940
Kirby's Avalanche!

1664
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:50,940
I didn't tell you that.

1665
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:51,940
It's also supported in MAME, too, by the way.

1666
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:52,940
Oh, is it?

1667
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:53,940
Yeah.

1668
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:54,940
It's good to know.

1669
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:59,200
But, there's, like, all kinds of versions, like, Nintendo 64 had a version, Saturn had,

1670
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:04,280
um, I think Puyo Puyo Sun, which is actually one I'm still looking for.

1671
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,760
That's a game I'm actually looking for, is Puyo Puyo Sun.

1672
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:10,520
Actually, and to be fair, maybe I shouldn't endorse the whole emulator thing, there, I

1673
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:15,160
believe Robotnik's Mean Beaten Machine is all over those Sega collections.

1674
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,080
It's tucked away on a lot of the Sonic ones.

1675
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:23,320
But, uh, I'm, in fact, I'm positive it's on the Mega, uh, Sonic's Genesis Collection game

1676
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:27,220
that came out a couple, like, last year, uh, and that's a great deal, because that game

1677
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:32,520
was only, like, what, 20 bucks, and it's, like, 30, 40 Genesis games, it's, it's, and

1678
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,880
some arcade games, uh, and Mean Beaten Machine is one of them.

1679
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:35,880
So cheap now.

1680
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:39,240
Oh, it's, uh, that is, seriously, that's an awesome buy.

1681
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,240
It really is.

1682
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,240
It's super fun.

1683
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:45,840
Especially for you younger guys, who, and gals, who didn't kind of grow up experiencing

1684
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,960
Genesis like, like we did.

1685
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:51,520
And there's also some actually pretty fun achievements in it, but you unlock your games,

1686
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,000
too, by getting certain scores on some of the crappier games.

1687
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Yeah.

1688
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Good times.

1689
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Yeah.

1690
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Okay.

1691
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,600
Um, see, see, see how much this woman knows about her classic gaming?

1692
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,640
That's why she gets a segment every week on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.

1693
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,640
Oh, by the way.

1694
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,640
Huh?

1695
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:09,880
Puyo Puyo 64 was a four player, was a four player Puyo Puyo C. Can you tell me who that

1696
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:10,880
was?

1697
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,880
See what I mean?

1698
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,880
She just, she knows her shit.

1699
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,440
So, uh, every week on this show, Dark Sakura dives into the vault and, uh, picks out a

1700
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:20,400
classic game that she thinks you all should be playing this week, right now.

1701
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,240
She was to edumacate you on a classic game.

1702
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,160
It's called Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1703
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,040
Dark Sakura, what could the Classic Game of the Week possibly be?

1704
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,240
It's Descent.

1705
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,120
What a crazy coincidence.

1706
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,440
What made you, what made you decide to pick it this week?

1707
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,120
Uh, because I felt like it.

1708
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,120
It was either that or Microcosm.

1709
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,120
Maybe next week.

1710
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,120
Maybe.

1711
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,400
Alright, well this is, it's certainly worthy of being the Game of the Week and even, you

1712
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,920
know, it just, it ties into the news, certainly, but I think there's a lot of people that miss

1713
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,920
this game.

1714
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,920
Yep.

1715
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,920
So tell us about Descent, Dark Sakura.

1716
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:53,680
So you go throughout the solar system from the moon to, uh, Pluto's moon, Charon, and

1717
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,320
then you beat a boss robot, but then you can't go home.

1718
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:02,880
Um, but yeah, all these infected robots, you have to shoot them and then stop the main

1719
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,360
robot, blah, blah, blah.

1720
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,760
Um, this is actually one of the games that made me really motion sick.

1721
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:17,680
For, it was, um, it used, um, a wireframe map, but, um, it was only, like, around your

1722
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:24,360
absolute position, so you, you know, as you'd move through it, it was, it, it's really hard

1723
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,360
to describe.

1724
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:30,160
And also, the thing that actually made me really motion sick about this one is that

1725
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,720
you seem to always be tilting.

1726
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:37,380
I mean, I'm not the only one who saw that, right?

1727
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:38,560
So anyway, um.

1728
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,520
I would play it spinning all the time.

1729
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,960
I was in a constant barrel roll.

1730
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,800
I could, I had a hard ass time controlling it.

1731
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:57,760
Um, but, um, it was, it was actually, um, one of the, I think, harder games too.

1732
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,120
It was real, it was a full 3D environment.

1733
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:09,840
You had to increase your speed while using acceleration controls and, uh, directional

1734
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,920
controls and different stuff.

1735
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,400
You had to pretty much multitask the entire time you were playing.

1736
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,400
So that was pretty difficult.

1737
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:24,560
Um, it did have an 8-player LAN mode, um, and then, um, actually, I think there's even

1738
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,280
still Descent servers up today.

1739
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:33,320
Um, Descent 2, um, was, uh, actually supposed to be pretty much okay online too.

1740
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:40,080
Um, there were 27 levels, um, in, and 3 secret levels in the first Descent.

1741
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:49,120
You had, like, some of them were the moon, um, Venus, Mercury, um, parts of Mars, uh,

1742
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:54,600
moons on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, blah, blah, blah.

1743
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:59,240
Um, so you would just show up in your different location when you started and you would have

1744
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:02,560
your, um, shield energy, which was like your life.

1745
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:09,640
Um, but you could, um, only, um, restore your shield through power-ups and it would only

1746
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,280
go up to 200%.

1747
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:17,280
Um, and if you finished the mission below 100%, your shield's charged to 100%, but on

1748
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,440
the, but if you were above 100%, then it would stay where it was.

1749
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:24,440
Like, if you were at 120, it would be at 120 when you start off.

1750
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:29,880
Um, and you did have limited lives, unlimited in multiplayer, um, and when you respawn,

1751
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,880
you start from the beginning, the beginning of the level.

1752
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,240
So it was pretty, kind of crazy.

1753
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:45,280
Um, it was originally DOS, um, for 386 PCs, uh, 33 megahertz, um, you play it on something,

1754
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:48,960
you know, now, of course, it's gonna play like a dream, you know, if you can, of course,

1755
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:49,960
find this doctor.

1756
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,680
Yeah, you're gonna have to use one of those programs to slow, like, it would be too fast,

1757
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,680
yeah, like a DOS emulator.

1758
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:59,120
Um, there is a port- Or wait for WiiWare.

1759
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,120
Yeah.

1760
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:05,440
Um, there is a, uh, port for, uh, PlayStation, and there was one planned for Saturn that

1761
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,160
never was released.

1762
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:12,520
Um, so yeah, you can get, um, there's a shareware version of 94 that came out after Doom came

1763
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:23,640
out, um, and you'd, like, we were saying you have to use a software renderer, um, but,

1764
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:29,280
um, other than that, it was just, it- Just be prepared for a trip, because you gotta

1765
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:34,120
fly upside down and all this stuff, you know, it's full 360 degrees, I mean, what's- The

1766
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:38,360
way I kind of think of this game is it's, like, Doom without gravity, you know?

1767
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,360
Yeah.

1768
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:43,520
Well, and on top of that, the one thing that you're having to do is that the texture mapping,

1769
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:50,000
um, goes every 32 pixels, so you deal with a lot of pop-up, especially if you're, actually,

1770
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:56,440
if you don't have things set to emulate it just right, you know what I mean?

1771
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:57,440
Mm-hmm.

1772
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:02,160
And, um, the, uh, engine used for it is a, uh, portal rendering engine, so that, um,

1773
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:09,680
you could connect different sectors, so, uh, that was pretty cool, um, and they've actually,

1774
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:15,640
um, released the, uh, source code without the audio in 97, and actually the source code

1775
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,240
for Descent 2 was released in 99.

1776
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,240
Oh, wow.

1777
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:24,280
So different expansions out, there's the Descent Mission Builder, uh, 95, uh, there was Descent

1778
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:30,040
Levels of the World 95, Descent Anniversary Edition that had all the other add-ons, and

1779
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:34,040
the extra levels that Parallax made, Descent on PlayStation, and Descent on WiiWare that's

1780
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,640
coming out this fall.

1781
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:41,360
Um, as far as anything that's related to, there was Descent Under Mountain, which was

1782
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:46,760
an RPG that used the Descent Graphics engine, um, but wasn't really in it, and then there

1783
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,560
was the clone Forsaken, do you remember that?

1784
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,760
Yes, I do.

1785
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,760
Was that the one that had the commercial?

1786
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:53,760
Yeah.

1787
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:54,760
The future's forsaken.

1788
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,480
Yes, I remember that game.

1789
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:02,640
And then, um, Descent Free Space The Great War was put out, um, by Volition in 98, but

1790
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,520
it wasn't really a Descent game, I just shared the name.

1791
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:11,400
Um, Volition was working on Descent 4, but it was cancelled in, um, 2000 because Descent

1792
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:17,280
3 didn't sell that well, so, but it served as the basis for Red Faction.

1793
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,280
Interesting.

1794
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,280
So.

1795
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,280
Alright.

1796
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,280
That's it.

1797
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:25,480
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1798
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,920
I can't believe it, it's not Sega.

1799
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:27,920
That's alright, no.

1800
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,920
Hey!

1801
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:29,920
No, it's a good game, this is a great pick.

1802
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,520
I felt it was appropriate.

1803
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,080
It's very, uh, news appropriate.

1804
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,080
I love it.

1805
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,080
So fair.

1806
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,360
And it's a game I really enjoy, and I actually remember this one.

1807
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,320
Oh god, this game made me so motion sick.

1808
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,760
You know when I was saying that the Pixel ones never did?

1809
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,760
This one actually?

1810
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,680
Well it was really rudimentary 3D rendered.

1811
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,440
It really was, it wasn't so sprite based, it was like, it really was 3D rendered.

1812
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,760
It kind of looks like Mode 7 Hell.

1813
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,760
Yeah.

1814
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,400
Well except not as blurry.

1815
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,400
Yeah.

1816
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,880
But yeah, even watching it on YouTube is like, ugh.

1817
01:30:58,880 --> 01:30:59,880
Blur.

1818
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:00,880
Alright.

1819
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,880
There it is.

1820
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:04,560
But do you not see what I mean by it feels like you're tilting all the time?

1821
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,240
No, and the full 360 motion is kind of hell on the brain.

1822
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,240
I get what you're saying.

1823
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,240
Oh, yeah.

1824
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,240
Alright.

1825
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:14,000
Well we got plenty more coming up when we come back from a quick break here at Orange

1826
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Laundry Radio.

1827
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
We're only halfway done if even that.

1828
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,520
We're going to talk about some moving and shaking going on on the PlayStation Network.

1829
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:24,080
We're going to talk about arcades, a major arcade chain going through some big changes.

1830
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:29,240
And Capcom, apparently some big, big news leaking out of Capcom.

1831
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,260
Someone's breaking embargo.

1832
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:34,880
We will talk a little bit about that a little later on in the show.

1833
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,880
But yeah, stay tuned.

1834
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:45,360
We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1835
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:51,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, April the 18th of 2010.

1836
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,600
It should be noted that it is the night before dark.

1837
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,600
Sakura's birthday.

1838
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,600
Birthday, birthday, birthday.

1839
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:57,600
Yep.

1840
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,800
So I'm doing whatever I want.

1841
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,800
So happy birthday.

1842
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,800
Early birthday.

1843
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:01,800
Do you have to work tomorrow?

1844
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,800
No.

1845
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:03,800
I don't.

1846
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:04,800
I asked for tomorrow off.

1847
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,800
Nice.

1848
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,800
That's the best birthday present you could possibly give yourself.

1849
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,800
But guess what I have to do?

1850
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:08,800
What?

1851
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,800
Hang out at DMV.

1852
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:10,800
Uh-oh.

1853
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,800
Is tomorrow the day your license expires?

1854
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,800
And I didn't schedule an appointment.

1855
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:14,800
No.

1856
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:15,800
No.

1857
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,720
The thing that I was working on when you got here has been eating all my time.

1858
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:20,720
Oh, I see.

1859
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,720
That, and I was sick.

1860
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:22,720
Sick.

1861
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,720
That's a bummer.

1862
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,720
Yeah.

1863
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:25,720
I feel a lot better now.

1864
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,720
Well, how do you feel about-

1865
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,720
How about me smelling glue?

1866
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,560
How do you feel about turning 21?

1867
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,200
And now you'll actually be able to drink legally?

1868
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,200
Just kidding.

1869
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,200
All right.

1870
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:40,680
You know, whoever guesses my age, if they shut up, then I will give them a prize.

1871
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,680
All right.

1872
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:42,680
I actually, you know what?

1873
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:43,680
You know what?

1874
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:44,680
I don't care if people know how old I am.

1875
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,680
Okay.

1876
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,680
You know how old I am?

1877
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,680
How old?

1878
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:51,240
I will be, as of 2 a.m., 34.

1879
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,240
Congratulations.

1880
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,240
34 years young.

1881
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:56,120
34, and I still get carded for DVDs.

1882
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,120
Rock.

1883
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,120
There you go.

1884
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:05,000
So, and I have to say, for all of you people who were in your late teens and 20s and are

1885
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
whining, shut up.

1886
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,440
It gets better at 30.

1887
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,440
It really does.

1888
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,440
It really does.

1889
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,360
I was really dreading 30, but 30 has been awesome.

1890
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,360
So far.

1891
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:13,360
Seriously.

1892
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,360
So far.

1893
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,360
It's like-

1894
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,360
Did you hear that, Loki?

1895
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,360
Life gets better at 30.

1896
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,360
How do you feel about that?

1897
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,360
Loki's not 30 yet.

1898
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,360
He shrugs.

1899
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,360
Almost there.

1900
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,360
Yeah.

1901
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:25,800
Well, I mean, because it's sort of like you hit this level, like right when you were in

1902
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:31,360
your early 30s, that's like all this little drama crap stops mattering.

1903
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,800
Like, why was I worried about that?

1904
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,240
Why do I care?

1905
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,460
And it's like, okay.

1906
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:40,460
So right.

1907
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:41,920
The least that has to happen with me.

1908
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,720
I stopped caring.

1909
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,720
I don't know.

1910
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,480
For me, I just found I got laid more in my 30s than I did in my 20s.

1911
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:48,480
You know?

1912
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,480
Just saying.

1913
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,480
I'm kidding.

1914
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,480
I'm kidding.

1915
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:52,480
No, I'm not.

1916
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,480
All right.

1917
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:58,240
I just want to wake people up and make sure people are really paying attention.

1918
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,240
All right.

1919
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,600
And there's, oh, everybody in chat is saying like, oh, I'm 27.

1920
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,600
I'm 31.

1921
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,600
I'm 23.

1922
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,600
There you go.

1923
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:05,600
I'm waiting.

1924
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,000
I'm waiting for, where's, where's the, like, uh, God, don't we have like a 14 year old

1925
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
that listens?

1926
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Cheeseburger.

1927
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
How's cheeseburger?

1928
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Cheeseburger.

1929
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
I think it's 15 now.

1930
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I think it's 14.

1931
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,800
I was like, oh my gosh, your parents know what you're doing.

1932
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,800
And then now what?

1933
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:17,800
DS master's really young too, isn't he?

1934
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:18,800
Yeah.

1935
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,800
But you know what?

1936
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:20,800
It's all good.

1937
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,200
Well, and you know, and the reason I can, I can actually get away with saying this because

1938
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:28,880
no matter how much you deny the whole, oh, I'm too old for the drama stuff when you're

1939
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:29,880
in your twenties.

1940
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:32,920
No, it still bites you.

1941
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,600
I thought I was over it.

1942
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,200
You're only as old as you feel.

1943
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,600
Age ain't nothing but a number and a biological function.

1944
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,600
All right.

1945
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,600
Anyhow.

1946
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,640
So let's get into some, uh, gaming news back to game news.

1947
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,640
Uh, Loki.

1948
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:45,640
Yes.

1949
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:46,920
Quick, quick stuff.

1950
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:51,600
A lot of, actually, believe it or not, I had a hard time kind of picking and choosing the

1951
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,440
stories for tonight because there was actually a lot of good stuff to talk about.

1952
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,080
So some of the stuff that we really should be spending like a long time talking about

1953
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,600
got pushed to this segment.

1954
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,920
So some quick stuff tonight.

1955
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:01,920
Yeah.

1956
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,280
So, uh, the PlayStation move, you may remember it has a controller.

1957
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,800
That's sort of like the nunchuck, but not the nunchuck.

1958
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:16,040
Well, anyways, um, this was recently discovered in FCC, um, trademark that the new controller

1959
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,520
will be called the navigation controller.

1960
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:27,800
So the navigation controller to the Sony move will be what the nunchuck is to the Wii remote.

1961
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:28,800
Awesome.

1962
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:36,280
Uh, and then apparently Lost Planet 2 is getting some more, um, secret guest characters that

1963
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:41,080
you'll be able to, um, play as, including a man who has covered wars.

1964
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:48,520
Uh, Frank West will be returning from Dead Rising, including a giant teddy bear backpack

1965
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:51,160
that he will be, um, I guess carrying.

1966
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:57,080
It's kind of really cute how the teddy bear holds his extra, you know, assault rifle.

1967
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,840
Um, that's neat.

1968
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:03,040
And then of course, um, there's going to be a guy from Monster Hunter as well.

1969
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:10,160
Um, they're referring to him as the scaly knife gun dude, but, um, that's pretty cool

1970
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:15,440
that they have all these, I love the fact that they gave Frank West to teddy bear, all

1971
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:21,620
the Frank West and the mega man outfit would have been a plus, just saying, well, Hey,

1972
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:22,620
we can dream.

1973
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:25,560
Maybe they'll have alternate costumes or something later on, by the way, just real quick.

1974
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:29,080
I don't mean to derail you low key, but I had to issue a correction here because this

1975
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,640
is very important.

1976
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:34,200
Cheeseburger is actually in chat right now wants to clarify he turned 16 on Valentine's

1977
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:38,000
day, but he's been listening to OLR for four years.

1978
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,960
So you do the math and I'm just like, Oh my God.

1979
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:48,560
But then again, you know what, when I was 12 when I was your age cheeseburger, Oh God,

1980
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,560
I'm that guy.

1981
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:55,640
No, but for real, I was calling into BBSs on my modem when I was 12 and posting on message

1982
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:59,600
forums and talking about tons of shit I a 12 year old shouldn't be like reading or talking

1983
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,600
about.

1984
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:07,040
But all I have to, I, I just hope your parents know it's an R rated show, but I don't think

1985
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,600
we're a bad influence.

1986
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:12,600
I like to think we teach you, you know, how to think for yourself and how to, uh, how

1987
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,600
to write, write proper emails.

1988
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,600
Yes.

1989
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,600
You've got your grant.

1990
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:28,560
Seriously, you've got politics, nutrition, um, speech, debate and grammar and hand-eye

1991
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,000
coordination above all from video games.

1992
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
All right.

1993
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Anyhow.

1994
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Sorry, Loki.

1995
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
All right.

1996
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:41,320
And then, um, other fun stuff we can be talking about here, of course, um, pillow fight girls,

1997
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:45,200
a game that will be coming to the iPhone very soon.

1998
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:52,320
And um, it features scanly clad women and having pillow fights.

1999
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:57,760
Apparently it will be a lot of people actually, apparently it'll be a reprise of the 2007

2000
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:05,760
Java hit sexy girls, but of course getting the more PG 13 rated, um, title pillow fight

2001
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:06,760
girls.

2002
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:07,760
Yeah.

2003
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,760
Well that's because, uh, didn't, uh, Apple crack down on a lot of those borderline porn,

2004
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,600
the soft core titles, if you will.

2005
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,600
Yes.

2006
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,640
But, uh, they are scanly clad and well endowed.

2007
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:21,280
Well, there you go.

2008
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,280
All right.

2009
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,280
Pillow fight girls.

2010
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,120
In other words, half naked and big boobed.

2011
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:30,320
That's the more, I guess that was a politically correct way of saying, I don't like to be

2012
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,320
politically correct.

2013
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,320
I know you don't.

2014
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:38,280
Another thing she teaches on this show, how to say it plain, uh, a little big planet too

2015
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,160
might've been inadvertently confirmed.

2016
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:45,680
Uh, that's because musician Christopher Leary, who go by, who goes by the pseudonym Ochere

2017
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,280
announced on his Twitter.

2018
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,280
Here we go.

2019
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,280
Twitter breaking the news.

2020
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:54,360
Again, his song infotain me has been licensed to Sony for little big planet too.

2021
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:58,520
This is not the first time it's been accidentally mentioned that little big planet too exists.

2022
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,720
Here's a clip by the way, what this song sounds like.

2023
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:09,760
Let me skip in a little ways here and hearing this, it does sound very little big planet.

2024
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,600
I could see this in like a watery level or something.

2025
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:17,360
Well, here's the thing too, everyone's like, Oh my God, they're doing a sequel.

2026
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:22,760
It could very well just be a big old dialogue content pet that they do and add like a whole

2027
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,520
new story mode with levels and stuff because they've already said they're not doing a sequel,

2028
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:30,040
but it doesn't mean they can't release a new level pack that basically has an entirely

2029
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:33,120
new storyline to go with it with new features.

2030
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,520
I think they could do a sequel.

2031
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,640
They could get away with it and not look like jerks.

2032
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:43,220
I think they've supported the first one so well that they honestly, the paintball gun,

2033
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:48,640
the water, all of that could have been a sequel and I think they would have been able to justify

2034
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:52,400
having that and selling, you know, the game for 40 bucks or whatever.

2035
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:56,640
But uh, you know, I, if they're doing a true sequel with all new media molecule levels

2036
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,960
and a couple of new elements, who knows what will be in it.

2037
01:39:58,960 --> 01:39:59,960
I think it's okay.

2038
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:03,440
I'm not going to get mad at him for saying before they weren't going to do a sequel because

2039
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,480
you know what?

2040
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,840
I think they resisted the temptation long enough.

2041
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:11,080
But again, I would hope that there's enough here to really justify that big two in front

2042
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,080
of it.

2043
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:16,040
But, um, I, you know, media molecule really didn't disappoint with the first game.

2044
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:20,240
I have faith, but maybe that's just me.

2045
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,480
Are you saying you would not support a little big planet to Loki?

2046
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,480
No, sure.

2047
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,480
I'd pick it up.

2048
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,480
It was awesome.

2049
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:26,480
I would too.

2050
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,480
It was my favorite game in the year it came out.

2051
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:28,480
So, all right.

2052
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,480
This, uh, it might be a worth picking up too.

2053
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:30,480
Super Mario Galaxy two.

2054
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:34,160
Of course the first game was really amazing and I think a lot of people kind of forget

2055
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,120
that like it's a really great Wii game.

2056
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,240
Super Mario Galaxy two is on the way.

2057
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,980
And of course Super Mario Galaxy brought us B Mario.

2058
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:41,980
How rad was that?

2059
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:42,980
Right?

2060
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:43,980
B Mario was actually really cool.

2061
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:47,280
Um, right up there with like Tanooki suit Mario, maybe not as cool as Tanooki suit Mario,

2062
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,280
but almost.

2063
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:53,960
Well, Super Mario Galaxy two is trying to up the cute and, uh, the memorable Mario forms.

2064
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:58,400
Cloud Mario is going to be one of the new Mario forms in Super Mario Galaxy two.

2065
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:02,800
So you mean he's going to be angsty and have a big sword and ride a big motorcycle club

2066
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:03,800
thing?

2067
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,800
No, not that cloud.

2068
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,800
Like a happy fluffy cloud.

2069
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:06,800
Like a Bob Ross cloud.

2070
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:07,800
Bob Ross, Bob Mario.

2071
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:08,800
Yes.

2072
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,800
He's a Bob Mario cloud.

2073
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:10,800
Bob Mario.

2074
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:11,800
There you go.

2075
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:15,880
Uh, he got like these white overall looking things on instead and, uh, what he can do

2076
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:18,940
with this power, he creates cloud steps.

2077
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:22,160
He walks on them and can get to out of the way places.

2078
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,160
By the way.

2079
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,280
Um, there's also a rock form Mario in case you forgot.

2080
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,320
So there are some new forms of Mario coming to the game.

2081
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:28,320
That sounds kind of cool.

2082
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,320
Actually.

2083
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,760
I gotta say cloud Mario makes me kind of think of metal Mario from Mario 64.

2084
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:32,760
Hmm.

2085
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:33,760
I forgot about middle.

2086
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,400
All right.

2087
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,720
This one's a little interesting.

2088
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:41,220
This story and we could probably have a much longer discussion about this, but I thought

2089
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:44,820
the quote was worth talking about here and it's something I don't think everybody's really

2090
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:51,560
thought about and that is how do you handle in a game like Def Jam rap star, the N word

2091
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:55,960
and you know, cause a lot of rap music uses that word.

2092
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,800
There's a lot of people that aren't comfortable saying that word.

2093
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:04,140
So how do you kind of address this in the development of your video game?

2094
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:07,880
And there's this very interesting article and I'll give credit to Destructoid who I'm,

2095
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:11,720
I'm actually reading this from and stealing the article on that tries to kind of tackle

2096
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,360
this topic here of this.

2097
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:17,780
Now Konami, Def Jam, 4MM games, all the people that went into producing this game, they're

2098
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:21,240
using radio edits for the songs and the music videos and so forth.

2099
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:25,120
So I think that way you kind of skirt around the issue.

2100
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:30,780
But actually the N word is, is, is one that kind of shows up still.

2101
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:34,300
So they put in dashes for most foul words.

2102
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:37,480
But they find that when people are playing it and this, this, this guy who wrote the

2103
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:41,280
article for Destructoid is talking about, you know, when I was playing it, I, I was

2104
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:46,400
okay with saying when I saw F dash dash, I would say, fuck S dash dash, I would say shit.

2105
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:51,320
When I saw N dash dash, I didn't really want to say that word.

2106
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:56,000
And so the guy at Destructoid went to Jamie King, who is the chief creative officer for

2107
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,280
4MM games and got this quote in return.

2108
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,600
And I thought this was worth sharing because you really have to think like, how do you,

2109
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,380
how do you, you know, there are some people that play rock band and even the rock band

2110
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:06,380
uses the radio edits.

2111
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:10,040
Some people don't want to sing the fuck and the, you know, the, the, they're in some of

2112
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,040
the songs, right?

2113
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:16,160
It actually made it really hard for me to sing a, a fallout boys song, um, the scene

2114
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:18,360
is seen it's an arms race, right?

2115
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:22,120
Cause I'm, so you're just singing it in the car on the radio that I just automatically

2116
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:23,120
enter.

2117
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:24,960
I'm like, it's throwing me off.

2118
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,380
It's scoring me down.

2119
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:29,600
So anyway, here's a quote I wanted to share.

2120
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,960
We don't have ownership of that word as white people of that word.

2121
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:38,320
I think that word does come up and that is perhaps a word where with the radio edits,

2122
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,220
there is an opportunity to not say it.

2123
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:43,660
We certainly don't make it a central part of the story or the career mode.

2124
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:47,720
That is a very personal decision in that point in time, regardless of race, creed, and color

2125
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:52,440
as for how you use that word in the context of the song, obviously these artists are using

2126
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,440
it.

2127
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,780
They've empowered it and own it to just shy away and be frightened doesn't mean we should

2128
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:57,880
abuse it.

2129
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:01,840
And hopefully I think we've treated it in a respectful manner, the way all these artists

2130
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:08,020
and their content in their work would expect us to very well thought out point on, on what

2131
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:10,680
is a very tricky otherwise issue.

2132
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,760
I just still like what Chris Rock said about it.

2133
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,760
What?

2134
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:19,040
So if you're, if you're a white person in your car listening to Dre, go ahead, say it,

2135
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,840
go ahead and sing your Dre.

2136
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:27,000
But no, um, well I told you about, and actually I found a comedian recently, I think it was

2137
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,460
Brian Reagan, but back when I was hanging out with somebody else, we used to just go

2138
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:34,360
around doing the white version.

2139
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:35,360
Yeah.

2140
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,360
Right, right.

2141
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,680
And it was, we just did it because we thought the whole thing was, was kind of ridiculous

2142
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,680
and funny.

2143
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:47,800
So, well, I mean the, or the origin, but now being pulled into common usage, there's only

2144
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:53,360
thing that's fine to take something and you know, take something that was, you know, made

2145
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,900
for, well, okay, here's another example to rephrase better.

2146
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:59,600
The triangle, the big gay triangle.

2147
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,600
You know where that came from?

2148
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:01,600
I do.

2149
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:05,120
That came from, uh, the concentration camps in Germany.

2150
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:09,260
The triangle was used to denote that they were in a concentration camp for being gay,

2151
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:12,080
but now it's a symbol of pride, right?

2152
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:19,460
So I say that if you can take something that was a sign of, you know, oppression or disrespect

2153
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:22,840
and make it something that you can, you know, to bind everyone together, say, hey, this

2154
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:26,600
is where we came from, this is us now, then I have no problem with it.

2155
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:32,400
I actually would be bothered if it was taken out of the game used in that context.

2156
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,400
You know what I mean?

2157
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:34,400
Mm-hmm.

2158
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,400
All right.

2159
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:36,400
Well, that's all I had.

2160
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,560
No, no, it's, it's, I thought the quote was worth sharing.

2161
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:43,480
It's a touchy, tricky subject, but I thought it was a well thought out quote, especially,

2162
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:47,400
you know, with game design, sometimes you have to approach these, it's just interesting

2163
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:52,820
that a freaking video game, you have these sometimes very deep cultural questions that

2164
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:56,760
you kind of realize like, oh, I'm going to have a lot of people paying attention to this

2165
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:57,760
game.

2166
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,760
How do we kind of approach this tricky topic?

2167
01:45:58,760 --> 01:45:59,760
Yeah.

2168
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,000
You know, and that might go, and that's not just with words necessarily, but maybe images

2169
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,200
and violence and, you know, sex and whatever else.

2170
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,200
I say it comes down to this.

2171
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:09,480
If you don't like it, don't play the game.

2172
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,480
Fair enough.

2173
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:11,480
All right.

2174
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:12,480
Sorry, I didn't mean to make a long topic out of a short story.

2175
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,760
No, no, but I, I, I'm glad that you brought that one up.

2176
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:15,760
All right.

2177
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,760
No problem.

2178
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:17,760
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

2179
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:18,760
Oh, I got stuff.

2180
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:24,560
Um, Rock Band, we, um, no, not only, um, but it's actually stuff that makes me very happy

2181
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,060
because it's a bunch of stuff that I like.

2182
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:31,200
There's, um, go heat in Cambria pack coming out with, with guns of summer, the, the, the

2183
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:39,280
guns of summer, we, um, here we are juggernaut and the broken, um, the pack for, uh, 440

2184
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,280
points.

2185
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:46,560
Um, well, Microsoft points, um, or 200, we points each are 160 Microsoft points each.

2186
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:53,020
And then, um, individual traffic, traffic tracks guy, I can't tell today are all songs

2187
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:54,020
that I like.

2188
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:58,600
There's Susie and the Banshees, peekaboo fuck yes.

2189
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,320
We needed more Susie and the Banshees on a rock band.

2190
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:04,440
There's a three pack out there, but peekaboo was like their biggest mainstream song.

2191
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,440
I think.

2192
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:08,080
So I'm kind of surprised that wasn't in the first group, um, super grass, sun hits the

2193
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,080
sky.

2194
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:10,080
I love super grass.

2195
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,660
Um, and the violent femmes, American music and the ones that are going to be on Lego

2196
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:19,440
rock band, our guns of summer, the broken and a sun hits the sky, the super grass song.

2197
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,200
Also more stuff.

2198
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:26,840
Um, Lord of Ultima, um, is, uh, the, the browser version MMO.

2199
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:27,840
Oh, sure.

2200
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,360
Let me get away from the glue.

2201
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,360
Sure.

2202
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,360
Sure.

2203
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:33,360
She's like, what's this glue?

2204
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,360
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

2205
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:35,360
Uh, don't like it.

2206
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,840
Um, but there is a beta, um, on for this, so you could play it, but it's coming out

2207
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:39,840
a week.

2208
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,840
So whatever.

2209
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:45,640
Um, but it's, uh, Lord's of Ultima coming out April 20th, Tuesday.

2210
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,040
Oh, that's not a week.

2211
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,040
That's a couple of days.

2212
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,040
Anyway.

2213
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:54,960
Also iPhone games, uh, Street Fighter four gets a new challenger.

2214
01:47:54,960 --> 01:48:00,760
You get Kami for free Kami in her butt.

2215
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:02,920
That's it for free.

2216
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:04,840
Is that, are they doing like a version upgrade or something?

2217
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,760
I guess it must be interesting.

2218
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:12,880
All right, well let's go to the Twitter and uh, every week we take your Twitter topics.

2219
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:18,220
You can follow us on Twitter at O L R and send us messages and uh, we post little reminders

2220
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:22,240
about when the show is posted and when we're going to go live and uh, sometimes especially

2221
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:26,160
the real big time to be following O L R on Twitter is when we're at shows because we

2222
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:31,760
will like post pictures and take questions and I remember last E3 I was just like, okay

2223
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,380
Twitter people, what do you want to, what do you want to see today?

2224
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:38,280
And I uh, let people basically, I was everybody's bitch on the internet.

2225
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:39,280
It was fun.

2226
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,280
Good times.

2227
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:43,960
Anyway, let's go to the Twitter questions and uh, see what you guys have for us tonight.

2228
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,840
Not a whole lot, but some good stuff.

2229
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:53,800
The shadow sniper on Twitter says, what's a good 32 inch HDTV for gaming max $550.

2230
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:58,340
So he's setting kind of a lowish limit, but I'm assuming maybe shadow sniper has saved

2231
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:02,440
enough money that maybe they want to go purchase a TV.

2232
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:04,280
I'm making a guess.

2233
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:08,980
I have a 52 inch, um, I think mine's a Samsung.

2234
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:12,160
So and we got ours for about 1200 so do the math.

2235
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:18,440
You can find, you know, a good, you know, 20 something, 30 something inch for around

2236
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,440
there.

2237
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,440
Right.

2238
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,440
Samsung makes good stuff.

2239
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:25,440
I also, I wouldn't, well, I would say, I can't tell you like a brand name and whatever right

2240
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,280
off the top of my head, but let me give you a few things to look for because you're shopping

2241
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:31,440
on the cheap end of things, a couple of things to look out for.

2242
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:36,880
There's a lot of HD TVs that are sold, but they're only 720 P and that's fine.

2243
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:41,600
It's a good quality picture, but just keep in mind it's not 10 80 P or it's not even

2244
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:46,920
10 80 I, my TV, however, is 10 80 I only and it works just fine.

2245
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:50,160
Like I don't, like there's been some times where I'm like, Oh, I should get a 10 EP,

2246
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:51,420
but then I'm like, why?

2247
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:53,440
It's not really going to be that big a difference.

2248
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,760
You know, there's no difference.

2249
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:58,480
So I've had, I have both, but do you think there's a difference between seven 20 and

2250
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:59,480
10 80?

2251
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:02,200
See, I would say that you could probably tell a little bit, it looks a little blurry or

2252
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:08,080
it's not quite as, you know, um, Chris, but 10 80 I and 10 AP, if seriously, if you're

2253
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:10,280
flipping between the two, you'd never be able to tell the difference.

2254
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:15,760
Uh, I think ours is a 10 80 P, but you know, again, SSJ 100 Matt says, all I can say is

2255
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:17,560
don't get a Phillips and get a warranty.

2256
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:19,840
Ziba in our chat says, Vizio is cheap and okay.

2257
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:24,920
I have a Vizio and I got it from a Costco, which I think is a great place to buy TVs.

2258
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:27,080
You know, they've revoked the, the constant return.

2259
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:30,720
I heard, well, people were probably abusing the hell out of it.

2260
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:32,440
I was like, what took them so long?

2261
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:33,880
I'm glad that we got our TV.

2262
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,880
They still have some, they still have some type of return policy, don't they?

2263
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:41,440
Yeah, but it's not the free returns for life, a free upgrades for life pretty much.

2264
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:42,440
Yeah.

2265
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:43,440
So that's good.

2266
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,440
I'm glad they got rid of that.

2267
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:45,440
They needed to.

2268
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:46,440
All right.

2269
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:47,440
Uh, oops.

2270
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,320
I was looking to let you put it this way.

2271
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:54,560
Um, Oh, wait, shadow sniper sent us that tweet twice and I got thrown off.

2272
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:55,560
Sorry.

2273
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:56,560
Oh yeah.

2274
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,120
Look, you know, I was going to say, um, refurbished stuff also is not bad.

2275
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:05,440
We had a, our first HDTV was a refurbished, uh, I don't remember what brand it was now,

2276
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,320
but I think make sure it's factory refurb, right?

2277
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,320
Yeah.

2278
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:11,040
It was factory referred, but the only really difference between that and the current model

2279
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:16,640
is it didn't have an HDMI port, which I could care less cause I don't really use it.

2280
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:20,920
Um, I do now I use it on my PlayStation three because I just don't want to have to swap

2281
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:25,160
HD, uh, components stuff, but I mean, you could, if you really want to, you could get

2282
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:28,440
like a converter for that, but it's not a big deal.

2283
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:34,000
But um, you know, we got ours, I think is for $800 a while back, but you know, I've

2284
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:41,520
now have a Sony, a 40 inch, um, uh, Bravia, I think it's not bad.

2285
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,520
Shadow sniper.

2286
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:43,520
I hope you're in chat.

2287
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,140
I don't see your name unless you're on something else in chat, but there's like all the chatters

2288
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:47,440
are jumping in here.

2289
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:51,440
Uh, cheeseburger says I got a 24 inch as Seuss from new egg.

2290
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,240
It's 10 ADP and I love it for gaming.

2291
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,240
Dude.

2292
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,240
You're 16.

2293
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:56,240
How did you get that?

2294
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,240
He must have a job already.

2295
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,240
I don't know.

2296
01:51:58,240 --> 01:51:59,240
Or, or got some money from the parents.

2297
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,240
I don't know.

2298
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:01,800
Uh, act F says 32 inch.

2299
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,060
You're not going to notice a difference.

2300
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:05,400
And Weiland says I have a 10 ADP, 42 inch sharp.

2301
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:06,400
I got it for $500.

2302
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,400
Whew.

2303
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:10,120
Maybe I need to get in the market for a new TV now.

2304
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:11,120
Here you go.

2305
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:12,120
I've had mine for a while.

2306
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:21,240
Um, they have a viewsonic 32 inch 1080p LCD HDTV on new egg for $499.99, $40 for shipping.

2307
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:24,680
And Sharon says I'm still running the same SDTV I have for five years.

2308
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:25,680
It does what it needs to.

2309
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:30,800
Or actually they also have another Toshiba that's our Toshiba one that's actually also

2310
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,200
10 ADP, $5 shipping though on that one.

2311
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:39,560
So I'd say that's probably the, uh, the best, uh, or cheapest one you're gonna find.

2312
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:44,320
Actually let me, let me get into some of the, Loki's just shopping on newegg.com.

2313
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,320
Check it out.

2314
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:49,480
Uh, the other thing too is actually watch, um, sellout.woot.com.

2315
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:50,480
Oh yeah.

2316
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:51,480
And Woot.

2317
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:52,480
Oh yeah.

2318
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,480
Woot will have some good TVs.

2319
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:54,480
It's $5 shipping.

2320
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,480
Exactly.

2321
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:56,480
$5 shipping.

2322
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,480
That's where I need to buy a new TV is woot.com honestly.

2323
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,480
Keep an eye out.

2324
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,480
Okay.

2325
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:00,480
We've got to get some other tweets.

2326
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,480
One last little one.

2327
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:02,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2328
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,480
Best Buy.

2329
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:04,480
Uh huh.

2330
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,480
Look in their returns.

2331
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,240
A lot of times stuff's brought back because it's just dinged on the side or something.

2332
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:10,800
If you don't care about what it looks like on the outside of it, you can get a good deal.

2333
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:15,840
We got our refrigerator for like 300 bucks off and our dryer for like two thirds the

2334
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:16,840
cost.

2335
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:17,840
Oh wow.

2336
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:18,840
Because they were just dinged.

2337
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:19,840
Awesome.

2338
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:20,840
So.

2339
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:25,640
Uh, Surtur on our Twitter says, playing Harvest Moon Friends of Mineral Town on my GBA, waiting

2340
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:28,320
for Harvest Moon Hero of Leaf Valley to come out on the PSP.

2341
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,680
I guess that's a little bit of his gaming week right there.

2342
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:31,960
Harvest Moon.

2343
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:34,120
I'm surprised that's a series I didn't get more into.

2344
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:35,120
I don't know.

2345
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:37,240
Uh, Tiger Claw says there's some links on Twitter.

2346
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:40,760
Uh, this one was originally in the show roll and I bumped it for something else that I

2347
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:41,760
wanted to talk about more.

2348
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,280
Uh, it was about No Doubt.

2349
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:48,760
And uh, apparently No Doubt, uh, they have won the first few um, skirmishes in the battle

2350
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:49,760
with Activision.

2351
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:54,080
Uh, I guess Activision wanted the thing thrown out of court because it was a lawsuit without

2352
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:55,080
merit.

2353
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:56,080
But guess what?

2354
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,080
The Los Angeles County Superior Court.

2355
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,960
They ruled in favor of No Doubt.

2356
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:04,440
So they rejected the shift to a federal court and rejected Activision's, uh, efforts to

2357
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,840
try and put free speech in, uh, free speech injunctions involved.

2358
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,720
I, I'm kind of not surprised by that move.

2359
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:12,520
I think, uh, No Doubt could have a very good argument here.

2360
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,660
It's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out.

2361
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,720
I'd really love to see the contract they signed.

2362
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:21,400
I mean, without being able to read that, I, I, it's hard for me to take sides in this.

2363
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:25,720
So it's very interesting to see what's going to happen in court of law.

2364
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:28,840
Also I think worthy of mention, Tiger Claw sends this on Twitter.

2365
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:31,440
Starcraft 2, this is a very recent news.

2366
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:35,000
Starcraft 2 has been given an adults only rating in South Korea.

2367
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,960
That, you know, if a game gets an adults rating over here, only rating over here, it can be

2368
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:40,960
kind of damning.

2369
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:44,840
Uh, they, Blizzard was shooting for an over 12 rating in the country.

2370
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,720
Originally they had been assigned an over 15.

2371
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:52,040
They sent a newer build of the game or something and now they got adults only.

2372
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,520
No word on why.

2373
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:57,280
Uh, joke all you want about the addiction level of the game, seeing as this is South

2374
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:59,880
Korea, but I don't think that plays a part in it.

2375
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:04,640
So, um, it might, it could, I don't know, but Blizzard's going to appeal it of course,

2376
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:05,640
and they'll probably get their way.

2377
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:10,480
I mean, it's that the release of that game is going to be like a cultural event over

2378
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,480
there.

2379
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:16,480
I mean, it's, it's, it's on the scale of a, I don't know, what are the huge releases here?

2380
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:22,600
Modern Warfare, Halo, Final Fantasy type release, obviously, um, Spassinator says, uh, I guess

2381
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:25,840
for tonight's show, the show has been renamed orange bra radio, huh?

2382
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,080
Maybe that's what we need to sell.

2383
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:28,080
Dark soccer.

2384
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,080
We should look into that.

2385
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:33,920
Bras that are orange for the lady fans of the show with OLR right on the cups.

2386
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:34,920
All right.

2387
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:35,920
All right.

2388
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:39,120
Uh, red entertainment says, uh, is there a reason why Activision hasn't created their

2389
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:40,760
own bank in real life?

2390
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:41,760
Sure.

2391
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:46,400
It might be illegal, but that hasn't stopped companies before, uh, creating their own bank.

2392
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:50,480
Do you mean like buying all their stock and there's, there's antigen.

2393
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:51,480
I don't know.

2394
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:56,080
I think he's being silly, but I don't know if I really get the joke, uh, sponge twang

2395
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:01,200
says to us on Twitter, let DS master 26 know I would take him up on his DDR perfect attack

2396
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:02,200
challenge.

2397
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:03,200
LOL.

2398
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,960
I only have access to songs on supernova too.

2399
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:09,600
Well, you guys, you might want to try to find each other on Twitter and, uh, just YouTube

2400
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,600
the battle.

2401
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:11,600
That's all we need.

2402
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:16,080
Uh, did your Rama S is sending us a message saying, I don't remember you guys saying that

2403
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,880
the slim X-Box three 60 was a fake.

2404
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:22,720
I don't remember saying it either cause I thought it was actually a definitely a plausible

2405
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:23,720
idea.

2406
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:24,720
I don't think it's fake.

2407
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:25,720
I don't think it's fake either.

2408
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:27,360
Was it proven fake this week or something?

2409
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,360
I didn't see it.

2410
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:29,360
It was.

2411
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:30,360
I missed it.

2412
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:31,360
No, I don't think I haven't seen anything.

2413
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,360
I it's real.

2414
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,760
I mean, seriously, if something did happen, it'll be in chat soon.

2415
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:35,760
We'll see.

2416
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:36,760
All right.

2417
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:38,480
Anyhow, let's get into some other gaming news.

2418
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:39,480
Uh, Loki.

2419
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:40,480
Yeah.

2420
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:44,720
I was going to say it's, it's definitely happy.

2421
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:49,240
Um, one thing that is not happening though would be PlayStation room.

2422
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:50,240
What is room?

2423
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:53,160
You may ask because you might've forgotten since they haven't really mentioned anything

2424
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:54,920
other than what it was teased.

2425
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:55,920
I think.

2426
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:56,920
I don't remember if it was Tokyo game show.

2427
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:59,960
I think it was Tokyo game shows where they showed it off anyways.

2428
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:05,240
Uh, PlayStation room was sort of like home is like a social networking service that was

2429
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:09,320
going to be available for the PSP where he had little characters or avatars that kind

2430
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:18,040
of look like almost like, uh, me's or your avatars that you have on, um, on Xbox live.

2431
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:25,800
But um, apparently it, uh, finished the Japanese only closed beta and they decided that they're

2432
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:29,360
going to cease development on the service.

2433
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:34,440
So Oh, well, I guess that's not coming.

2434
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:37,720
They just pulled the plug because there just wasn't gonna be enough interest in it or too

2435
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:40,800
many resources or home didn't take off the way they wanted it to or why?

2436
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:45,160
Because they're going to save it for the next nail PlayStation portable platform.

2437
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:46,160
That's a darn good thought.

2438
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:47,160
I bet that's really it.

2439
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,560
Uh, by the way, Rama wanted to clarify his tweet.

2440
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:55,760
He sent us a link to a news article on xbox.com talking about the recent Xbox 360 slim images

2441
01:57:55,760 --> 01:58:01,040
are fake and it shows a picture of a reported Xbox 360 slim and it's just an HD DVD player

2442
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:02,440
tilted the wrong way.

2443
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:03,440
Okay.

2444
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:04,440
That's fair enough.

2445
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:05,440
Yeah.

2446
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:06,760
That picture is obviously fake, but that's not the same picture that came up on the show

2447
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:13,600
a couple of weeks ago, so it might be disputing this story is a fake, but I think pictures

2448
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,600
are not.

2449
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:19,380
I still think the concept of the xbox 360 slim and just some of the things that were

2450
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:22,800
being talked about at that time, I think are certainly still plausible, although certainly

2451
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,860
there are going to be many websites out there that claim to have it even though they don't

2452
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:29,560
cause they're lying liars.

2453
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:30,560
I wouldn't lie to you guys.

2454
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:36,020
I have to make a comment from a Weiland because I posted a picture, um, one of the people

2455
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:42,840
I follow on deviantart, um, did, uh, a picture of Deadpool singing his own theme song, the

2456
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:47,200
Spiderman theme song, and he said that Deadpool needs to be a Marvel versus Capcom three.

2457
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,560
I agree.

2458
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:52,840
And they need to get the people who did his stuff on Mugen to, to make him.

2459
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:54,320
All right.

2460
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:55,800
So I have to agree to that.

2461
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:56,800
All right.

2462
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,120
Well, uh, let's talk about more PlayStation news and this is actually really important.

2463
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:05,960
Uh, PlayStation news, they usually do the network updates on Thursdays.

2464
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:08,560
That is actually going to be changing.

2465
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:13,000
And the theory is that this is actually part of the response to, um, actually why the Xbox

2466
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,160
does their releases.

2467
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:16,700
Uh, here's the deal.

2468
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:21,120
The American and European PlayStation store updates, they are moving starting in May to

2469
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:27,240
new days and PlayStation network in North America will now be Tuesdays.

2470
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:29,480
In Europe it will be now on Wednesday.

2471
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:31,560
Uh, kind of interesting.

2472
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:37,240
Uh, I think there are people out there that might buy games on Microsoft just because

2473
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:40,100
they can get them two days before they do on PS3.

2474
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:41,100
Do you think that that's true?

2475
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:43,680
Loki, that there's people out there that buy games on 360 simply because you can get it

2476
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:45,080
like a two days before?

2477
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:46,080
No.

2478
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:47,080
Really?

2479
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:48,080
I doubt it.

2480
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,080
Really?

2481
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,480
It's just basically forum bragging rights.

2482
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:51,480
That's about it.

2483
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:52,480
Huh?

2484
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,480
We eat the game earlier than you do.

2485
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:54,480
That's basically it.

2486
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:57,580
I think there is a small, it's small, but I think there's a group of people out there

2487
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:03,320
that knowing they can get the game, the game, the game a day sooner on the PS3 will opt

2488
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:04,320
to get it on the PS3.

2489
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:05,320
Yeah.

2490
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:09,720
And well, I guess they would be able to say, Hey, you know, you can get the game here first.

2491
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:12,680
You know, they can use that tagline or whatever.

2492
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:13,680
Hmm.

2493
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:15,520
Well, there you go.

2494
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:19,040
The updates are moving to be a little more competitive with Microsoft, although they

2495
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:22,480
didn't say that of course in the update, but I'm sure they were like, Oh, we're doing it

2496
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:25,160
because we want to be earlier.

2497
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:26,640
I didn't watch the video of the release.

2498
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:29,940
All you need to know is that it's moving two days back and, and now it's going to get very

2499
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:34,360
interesting to see if that changes sales figures or not.

2500
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:35,360
We'll see.

2501
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,360
Hey Rob.

2502
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:37,360
What's that?

2503
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,080
Um, who was it that just posted that?

2504
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:40,080
Um, Ziba?

2505
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,080
Yes.

2506
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:48,520
Put a deals.woot link in for a 42 inch, 10 ADP LCD HDTV with three HDMI inputs refurbished

2507
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:49,520
for $549.99.

2508
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:50,520
Really?

2509
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:51,520
Yep.

2510
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,520
Hold on.

2511
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,520
I'm looking at this right now.

2512
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,520
Is it still like $5 shipping?

2513
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:55,520
It's Phillips.

2514
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:56,520
We were warned.

2515
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:57,520
We were warned about Phillips.

2516
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:58,520
I don't know.

2517
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:02,360
And I'm going to tell everybody, whenever you're going through any of these sites and

2518
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:06,480
everything, no, no, there were a few people who actually said they recommended that it

2519
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,480
was great.

2520
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:11,480
Um, but always, always check consumer reports before you buy anything.

2521
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:12,480
Good idea.

2522
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,280
Especially before you spend that kind of money.

2523
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:15,280
Yeah.

2524
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,280
Free shipping even.

2525
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:17,280
Interesting.

2526
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,280
It's tempting.

2527
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:21,960
There's people on here who said they did a good job with it.

2528
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:22,960
Interesting.

2529
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:23,960
I don't have to think about it.

2530
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:27,000
It's very anti Phillips though, I'll have to hear more about his story before I had

2531
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
decided to do it.

2532
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
But thank you Zeba.

2533
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I appreciate you looking out.

2534
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Kiss, kiss.

2535
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:37,120
And there's a $10 coupon off for, um, at buy.com.

2536
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,120
We'll see.

2537
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:40,160
I don't, I really, honestly, guys, I shouldn't be spending money on a TV.

2538
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,160
You know what I really need to buy?

2539
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:42,160
A new car.

2540
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:44,960
And let's not even start that debate because everybody's going to try to sell me a different

2541
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,960
car.

2542
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:46,960
I am pretty sure I know what car I'm getting.

2543
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:52,840
Um, I just have to, uh, go get it, which hopefully will be soon.

2544
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:53,840
Anyhow, let's move on.

2545
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:54,840
Sakura.

2546
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:55,840
Other stuff.

2547
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:56,840
Dun, dun, dun.

2548
02:01:56,840 --> 02:02:00,800
Um, this is actually really sad news.

2549
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:09,560
Um, Sega has made a business decision and they are closing half of their GameWorks arcades

2550
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:19,920
that, um, they, uh, are, you can't, no more good beer, no more good, God, they had good

2551
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:20,920
food.

2552
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:27,360
Um, they're not saying which exactly ones are going to be closing, but, um, they're

2553
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:33,160
going to be, uh, closing, uh, seven, actually, well, less than half, but just under half,

2554
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:35,280
seven of the 15 locations.

2555
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:39,840
Some of them being Minneapolis, Long Beach, Columbus, Detroit, Indianapolis, Miami, and

2556
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:40,840
Tampa.

2557
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:41,840
But Seattle will live.

2558
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:42,840
In theory.

2559
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:47,040
Well, this, I'm sorry, but this news story calls for a little bit of sad trombone.

2560
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:50,960
There you go.

2561
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:53,760
Yeah, that's, that puts sadness into my heart.

2562
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:55,520
Well, it is sad.

2563
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,840
Arcades closing is sad.

2564
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:57,840
Whatever.

2565
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:02,140
I mean, I honestly feel like just when the past, like the lifespan of our show, we have

2566
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:05,240
literally watched arcades die.

2567
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:06,240
You know what I mean?

2568
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:07,240
It's, it is sad.

2569
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,240
It is sad trombone.

2570
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:09,600
It's worse than sad trombone.

2571
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:10,600
It's sad elephone.

2572
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:12,600
It's sad tuba.

2573
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:13,600
Yes.

2574
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:16,960
It's just, I don't know, it's just unfortunate.

2575
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,280
Because you know, we all met at the arcade.

2576
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:22,640
I don't know if the show would happen if we had all met on Xbox live or something different.

2577
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:26,400
You know, it's just, it's just sad that arcades are closing down.

2578
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:27,400
I mean, it's not a surprise.

2579
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:30,000
I hate that the arcades that we've met at is still open.

2580
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,800
It is, but it's, but it's different now.

2581
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,200
You know, you go over there, it's just not the same.

2582
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:36,520
I haven't been there in years.

2583
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:38,120
It's weird.

2584
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:42,100
So all right, well, sorry to hear about the GameWorks closing.

2585
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:45,320
More sorry to hear about the people who lose their jobs because of it.

2586
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:46,320
That's the other big rumor.

2587
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:47,320
Sad banana phone.

2588
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:48,320
That's right.

2589
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,320
Sad banana phone.

2590
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,320
All right.

2591
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:51,320
Low key.

2592
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:52,320
That would be what, the banana phone song in a minor key?

2593
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:53,320
Maybe.

2594
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:56,120
I've never heard, actually, is there a sad banana phone?

2595
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:58,320
Like you two, I don't have to hear this.

2596
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:00,640
No, Rob.

2597
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:07,760
So apparently the MPD numbers for March are out, and people are declaring Red Steel 2

2598
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,680
a flop.

2599
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:15,200
Apparently the game only sold 50,000 copies in its opening month.

2600
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:17,520
Okay, let's stop it right there.

2601
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:23,160
Yeah, they sold 50,000 copies in the first, what, 12 days that it was out?

2602
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:25,160
14 days?

2603
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:31,520
So I wouldn't exactly call it a flop, but it is kind of on par with the other, the other

2604
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:37,760
Wii mature games, I guess, are out there, even though it is teen rated, but still.

2605
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:41,080
I can confirm, though, it had, it did sell about 50,000 copies.

2606
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:48,240
It was like 49,000 and change, but I don't think it's actually going to be a flop, per

2607
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:55,160
se, because I know copies are still being sold, and also, you know, it might be something

2608
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:58,120
people are picking up a little bit later on.

2609
02:04:58,120 --> 02:05:02,880
I know the first Red Steel apparently sold over 100,000 copies in its first week, although

2610
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,960
that you can attribute to the fact that the Wii just launched, and so everybody's picking

2611
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:11,080
up games for it, and Red Steel 1, you know, had the promise of being, you know, kind of

2612
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:19,920
what Red Steel 2 is, so I wouldn't say that's really a good comparison either, but definitely

2613
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:25,480
it has been the trend that hardcore games, like Red Steel, haven't done well on the Wii,

2614
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:31,180
so we'll see if maybe this will break the mold.

2615
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:34,840
I guess it is probably too early to declare it a flop, but do you think there will be

2616
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:37,400
a Red Steel 3, or is it just too early to tell, period?

2617
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:40,520
Oh yeah, I'm sure there will be, and you know, here's the thing, it's like, the same thing

2618
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:45,400
happened with DJ Hero, where they're like, oh, it didn't sell, you know, for shit, and

2619
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:51,440
they really only had like, what, a week worth of data to go off of, so you have to just

2620
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:56,260
look at the amount of time that's, you know, passed, and where it's coming out in the month.

2621
02:05:56,260 --> 02:06:00,600
If it came out, say, in the first week in March, then it would be a different story.

2622
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:05,080
Then yes, it would be almost a month, well, it would be over a month that had passed,

2623
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:09,320
but those numbers would be reflecting at least most of the month, and yeah, that would be

2624
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:15,640
a flop, but seeing that it came out kind of at the end of the month, I wouldn't really

2625
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:23,760
call it a flop yet, but once the April NPD numbers come out, then you can call it a flop.

2626
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:26,080
Alright, I don't think this is a flop.

2627
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:29,600
This sounds like it's going to be the truth, at least this website is placing all their

2628
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:30,760
stock into it.

2629
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:35,760
Planetxbox360.com is running a report saying that their tipster, who's been right 19 out

2630
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:42,460
of 20 times, I like to know the one they were wrong on, but the tipster is saying that Capcom

2631
02:06:42,460 --> 02:06:47,880
had its captivate press event over in Hawaii this past weekend, and apparently what was

2632
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:52,440
being shown at the event, well, final builds of Lost Planet 2 and Dead Rising 2, which

2633
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:56,640
is to be expected, but there were also some surprise announcements that happened at this

2634
02:06:56,640 --> 02:07:01,420
event that you just haven't heard about yet, for whatever reasons, probably because the

2635
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:04,320
journalists are still coming back, or they are-

2636
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:05,320
Embargoes.

2637
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:08,440
Yeah, embargoes for a certain day, absolutely, that's probably what's going on, because you

2638
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:09,720
know why they do embargoes?

2639
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:12,000
Well, I'll get into that rant in a minute.

2640
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Yeah.

2641
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
First off-

2642
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
I know why they do embargoes.

2643
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Yeah, there's two reasons they do embargoes.

2644
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,720
We'll get into that in a minute, but first, the leaks that they're talking about, Marvel

2645
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:25,760
vs. Capcom 3 is supposedly going to be one of the games that comes out of this, running

2646
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:29,880
at a full 720p, actually, they have a little teaser art, I don't see Deadpool, but I can

2647
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:30,880
see-

2648
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:31,880
No, that's not-

2649
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:37,680
Oh, duh, they wouldn't have the art, they would have to, yeah, of course, duh duh.

2650
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:41,960
But anyway, it's gonna be a disc-based game, it is not Xbox Live Arcade, it is not PSN,

2651
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:48,480
it is full 720p for the games, which is typical for video games, apparently they spotted a

2652
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:53,600
Marvel employee at the event, the Twitter account for Marvel vs. Capcom popped back

2653
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:59,720
up recently, yeah, I mean, it all kinda seems like this is going on, they are just saying

2654
02:07:59,720 --> 02:08:04,540
they're gonna blow fans out of the water with the sheer number of characters the game includes

2655
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:05,720
on the disc.

2656
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:13,440
It will be a 2D game, but think Street Fighter IV, like, Street Fighter IV had its 3D elements.

2657
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:23,240
As far as that goes, I can't see how that is not true, because, I mean, Capcom has been

2658
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:29,440
awesome at sucking the fanboy wank for the past couple years now, I mean, think about

2659
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,440
it.

2660
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:33,960
Think about the projects that Capcom's done, oh, we should do a Street Fighter IV that's

2661
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:37,700
a little more inspired by Street Fighter II and it's like 2D, but, okay, is that what

2662
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:38,700
you want, guys?

2663
02:08:38,700 --> 02:08:39,700
You got it.

2664
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:43,160
Oh, you want a new Mega Man game that's just like Mega Man 2 and the old school games you

2665
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:44,160
love on the NES?

2666
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:45,840
Okay, guys, you got it.

2667
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:46,840
What?

2668
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:51,560
You want us to remake Bionic Commando and make it all souped up for Xbox Live- oh, okay,

2669
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:53,400
you crazy kids, you got it.

2670
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:57,520
Like, really, I mean, hasn't Capcom almost more so than any other company as of late

2671
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:01,080
been like, fanboy wank, you want it, you got it?

2672
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:04,400
Well, because they know if there's a cry for it, people are gonna spend money on it.

2673
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:07,200
Exactly, and what is the next thing people have been crying for?

2674
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:08,480
Marvel versus Capcom.

2675
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:12,560
And the only reason people say it's not happening is because of agreements and deals and Marvel

2676
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:17,280
and da-da-da, but when Marvel's got all these movies they wanna do, right?

2677
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:18,280
What better time?

2678
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:19,840
Especially with Iron Man 2 coming out soon.

2679
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:22,200
You know who I want in it?

2680
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:24,920
Howard the Duck.

2681
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:25,920
Maybe it's an unlockable character.

2682
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:29,200
Howard the Duck's a Marvel character, and he knows quack-fu.

2683
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:33,960
Dark Tetsuya says, uh, so more than the 56 that were in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, holy fuck.

2684
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:36,560
I guess so, if this is to be believed.

2685
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:37,560
I don't know.

2686
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:43,680
I mean, I, again, it seems very logical, and why not.

2687
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:48,200
Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 also being shown at the press event, apparently.

2688
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:50,280
There I guess is not much about this.

2689
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:53,520
There was just a trailer that was shown, but apparently they're saying there will be more

2690
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:58,880
at E3 2010, but the big, big announcement was Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

2691
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:00,740
So there you go.

2692
02:10:00,740 --> 02:10:02,400
I guess you'll hear more about it this week.

2693
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:05,600
Now, do we wanna go onto the topic of Embargos and why you're not hearing about this right

2694
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:06,600
now?

2695
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:07,600
Please do.

2696
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:11,820
Keep in mind, these journalists went to Hawaii.

2697
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:14,440
They didn't pay to go to Hawaii.

2698
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:18,400
Capcom paid for them to come out and go to Hawaii just to go to this event, and it probably

2699
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:22,280
wasn't just the event, but there was probably some, like, hoo-ha fancy dinners and luaus

2700
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:28,440
and all these other things that come with it, and, I mean, I don't know, there's a part

2701
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:31,320
of me that's kinda like, wow, that's almost, I don't know.

2702
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:34,400
You almost have to, you're gonna have to take reviews of these games with a grain of salt.

2703
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:38,960
Well, there's something also here, I'd just like to point this out, because this was on

2704
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:39,960
JoySig.

2705
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:42,560
It was a little kind of note at the bottom.

2706
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,840
It says, editor's note, JoySig is not attending Captivate this year.

2707
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:50,280
We determined that the perceived environment and the associated downtime of the event was

2708
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:53,400
not in accordance with our editorial policy.

2709
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:57,480
We expected to provide complete coverage of all the Capcom titles shown at Captivate during

2710
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:03,920
E3 this June, and then for more information on our policies, they have a link, and basically,

2711
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:08,880
I actually read through their policies where they don't keep any of the promotional stuff

2712
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:14,480
that they give them the kind of, you know, wet the whistle, I guess, you know, just to

2713
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:15,480
make...

2714
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:16,480
And they won't take trips and so forth.

2715
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:17,800
They won't take trips or anything, so...

2716
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:18,960
I can respect that.

2717
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:23,800
I actually, I can respect that policy quite a bit, you know, and it's interesting because

2718
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:27,520
they ran the same story, right, about the leaks, and now they're not, and they're not

2719
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:30,680
held to any type of embargo because they didn't go to the event.

2720
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:35,480
But it's very interesting because, I don't know how much we should say about this, but

2721
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:40,400
the three of us, I believe all three of us, once went to a press event for a company,

2722
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:44,360
and we won't say who, but we went to this press event and it was embargoed, meaning

2723
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:48,920
we couldn't talk about it until, I believe, two days after the event.

2724
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:49,920
Yeah.

2725
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:51,800
Yeah, I want to say it was two days after.

2726
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:54,760
And we were like, okay, fine, that gives us the time to kind of prep what we want to do

2727
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:57,960
on it, and we want to do extensive coverage on some of these things that we saw at the

2728
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:58,960
event.

2729
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:08,080
And the next day, big websites like oneup.com, I want to say GamePro, IGN, they all were

2730
02:12:08,080 --> 02:12:13,400
suddenly running stories on certain games shown at this event, but each website was

2731
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:18,880
showing one different game.

2732
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:25,000
And we were kind of sitting here going, well, why did we do those embargoes then?

2733
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,480
And it just, you know, kind of the realization was that, oh, these guys probably had sold

2734
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:35,480
exclusive deals with these companies to get the first coverage on the game, because you

2735
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:40,400
know that if IGN is the first one that's going to run a news story on let's make something

2736
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:45,160
up, Capcom, Resident Evil, let's say Resident Evil 6 is announced, IGN has an exclusive

2737
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:47,040
deal to announce Resident Evil 6.

2738
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:50,780
The deal is they'll say what the company wants them to say, and they'll get hits from it.

2739
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:53,960
It's kind of shady, this stuff that goes on.

2740
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:59,440
Or they'll allow them to say later on, get a good deal on placing those giant splash

2741
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:03,840
ads that cover the entire background of their front page or something like that.

2742
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:08,200
Yeah, it's shady, but that's how the big boys do it.

2743
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:14,400
Yeah, well that's why I'm perfectly fine with our show being off the radar, even if we suffer

2744
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:19,960
in the number of listeners because of it, although if a game company wanted to fly me

2745
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:23,000
to Hawaii to check out their game schedule, I'm not going to say no.

2746
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,860
I don't think we have that same editorial policy, but I think the general understanding

2747
02:13:26,860 --> 02:13:30,400
is that we're going to be honest at the end of the day, period.

2748
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:34,960
But I can see where people might be like, oh, but you getting all this lavish treatment,

2749
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:37,320
you're going to have a biased opinion on the game.

2750
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:39,320
And that's why Joystiq has the policy they do.

2751
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:40,600
Not really, I can't imagine.

2752
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:41,600
I don't either.

2753
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:46,240
I've gone to events and seen games and said, you know what, they need to work on it.

2754
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:49,920
We've gone to Konami events, and there's a lot of stuff that we've been pretty negative

2755
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:50,920
about.

2756
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:59,040
That's why we're not invited to Konami events anymore, probably.

2757
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,480
You know what?

2758
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:05,680
Until you stop going to IGN4U News and until you stop going to the very first website that

2759
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:09,740
cracks all this information, this trend will continue, period.

2760
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:10,740
So I'll bet you what?

2761
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:15,480
I bet you some website beats the others to the punch on this news, assuming it turns

2762
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:19,160
out to be true, which again, I'm sure it is.

2763
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:22,420
This would make perfect sense for Capcom, period.

2764
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:24,480
This is more of a will Marvel let them do it question and answer.

2765
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:27,920
This is rumored to be revealed in a few weeks anyway, so.

2766
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:28,920
That's true.

2767
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,400
It was already going around.

2768
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:34,400
Oh, now some people are bringing up the whole Adartetsuya saying, I'm sure they were buying

2769
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:35,400
the 10s.

2770
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:36,500
They were going to give in their review.

2771
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:40,040
That kind of references the whole, um, oh God, what was it?

2772
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:41,040
It was a game.

2773
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:42,040
Kane and Lynch.

2774
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:43,040
Yes.

2775
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:44,040
Kane and Lynch and GameSpot.

2776
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:46,880
And the guy ended up leaving over it and Gerstmann.

2777
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:47,880
Oh man.

2778
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:48,880
Oh man.

2779
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:49,880
What a mess.

2780
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:50,880
Act.

2781
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:53,240
F wanted to reiterate that Kotaku has a similar policy.

2782
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:54,480
I just, I missed it.

2783
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,480
Okay.

2784
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:58,400
I've been gone all weekend, but I'm sure there's lots of websites that have very similar policy.

2785
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:03,240
So then my question would be who went, I don't know, not everybody can be trusted.

2786
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:04,240
Somebody blabbed their mouth.

2787
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:05,240
The planet.

2788
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:09,200
I didn't see anybody saying, Hey, we're going to captivate and we'll be talking about it

2789
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:10,200
because it's embargo.

2790
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:11,680
They can't say they're going well.

2791
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:12,680
Big Capcom news.

2792
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:20,040
As soon as I get home from Hawaii, anyhow.

2793
02:15:20,040 --> 02:15:21,040
All right, let's move on.

2794
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:23,680
Uh, we're going to get to the mailbag every week.

2795
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:27,360
You guys send us emails, mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we would like to crack

2796
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:32,120
open the mailbag and read them here on the air.

2797
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:35,160
Mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark Sakura dive in the mailbag head first.

2798
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:36,160
Pull out some emails.

2799
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:37,160
You know what, Rob though?

2800
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:38,160
I have to say, you know what?

2801
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:41,240
It sounded like you said you have to crap out.

2802
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:43,680
I did some of this is what you said.

2803
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:45,840
Why don't you crap out some emails star Sakura.

2804
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:47,800
How about you bite my butt, Rob?

2805
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:49,040
Not if you're going to crap out emails.

2806
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:51,720
You're the one who brought up crap.

2807
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:52,720
Okay.

2808
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:55,440
Dear OLR crew, long time, no email.

2809
02:15:55,440 --> 02:16:00,160
So I figured I would chime in my thoughts regarding the shutdown of halo two Xbox life

2810
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:01,160
support.

2811
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:02,160
Really.

2812
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,160
I'm not that sad to buy it.

2813
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:06,440
Seeing how I've already moved on from the game, occasionally playing halo three online,

2814
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:09,560
but the enjoyment I got out of halo two actually wasn't from the online play.

2815
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:14,640
I remember back in the day when me and my friends used to schedule a halo party where

2816
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:17,760
everyone would bring a TV in their systems and play via system link.

2817
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:18,760
It was a freaking blast.

2818
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:25,500
You know, we used to do that Dan's bachelor party was a halo land party using the system

2819
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:26,500
link.

2820
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:28,820
Wouldn't it be nice?

2821
02:16:28,820 --> 02:16:33,800
What would be nice is if bungee made a halo two map for halo map pack for halo three because

2822
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:37,800
honestly the maps in halo three are boring in comparison, at least for me.

2823
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:41,920
Oh, how I long through the headshots on coagulation and the headlong once more.

2824
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:43,880
Thanks for reading Ospher.

2825
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:48,680
P.S. here's a link to a simple but really moving YouTube that you can watch in your

2826
02:16:48,680 --> 02:16:49,680
own time.

2827
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:54,920
It's a simple walk through the multiplayer maps the game set to songs from the halo two

2828
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:55,920
soundtrack.

2829
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:57,720
Ah, memories.

2830
02:16:57,720 --> 02:17:00,640
You know, I'm such a bad, bad, bad gaming journalist.

2831
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:02,760
This is why I don't go to Hawaii.

2832
02:17:02,760 --> 02:17:06,160
I forgot that the Xbox closure was this week, but to be fair, there wasn't anything I was

2833
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:07,360
playing regularly on Xbox.

2834
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:08,360
I mean, yeah.

2835
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:12,160
Halo two I used to play back in the day, but most of the guys that used to play that together

2836
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:15,820
with me have kind of moved on to just other games in general, you know, be at halo three

2837
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:16,820
or what have you.

2838
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:17,820
So yeah, that's right.

2839
02:17:17,820 --> 02:17:19,560
I forgot to shut down this week.

2840
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:21,240
Don't say fuck halos and thrills in.

2841
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:22,240
All right.

2842
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:25,400
Well, what bite my butt.

2843
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:26,400
You get trout slapped.

2844
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:27,400
All right.

2845
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:34,100
Um, but the halo two, the guy, the emailer Ospher writes says, uh, why don't they do

2846
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:36,200
halo two maps on halo three?

2847
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:39,880
You do have to kind of wonder now the halo two is done and gone and what have you, as

2848
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:43,880
far as Xbox live goes, there's gotta be something they're going to do.

2849
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:47,920
And I know there's that rumor that, Oh, halo two will be an Xbox live arcade title.

2850
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:50,660
And of course there's those that saying, well, if you really want to play halo two, just

2851
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:54,760
system land it or play it on PC, but you got to wonder how they're going to kind of toss

2852
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:57,340
out the bone, if you will, to the halo two fans.

2853
02:17:57,340 --> 02:18:02,240
And I think putting out the maps and halo three is actually a really good idea, especially

2854
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:05,120
if you can somehow put in the halo two rules, I don't know.

2855
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:06,800
Or you just let it die.

2856
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:08,920
I don't know.

2857
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:09,920
We'll see.

2858
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:10,920
Maybe.

2859
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,400
But, uh, yeah.

2860
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:19,160
Rest in peace Xbox live on regular Xbox, but I am so welcome to now my friends list will

2861
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:20,160
hopefully very soon.

2862
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:23,080
I don't know when this is rolling out, but hopefully in the next couple of months after

2863
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:26,440
E3, I will be able to have a friends list with over a hundred people because I feel

2864
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:30,360
really bad because I have to delete people because new people will want to add me and

2865
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:33,600
I'm like, Oh yeah, I really want to have you on my list shit, but I have a hundred friends.

2866
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,720
Okay. Who hasn't signed on in the past two weeks?

2867
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:42,120
I think I'm the studio's 54 of, uh, of Xbox live cause I'll just delete people because

2868
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:43,920
I've decided that they're not elite enough.

2869
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:45,320
I just, I'm kidding.

2870
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:46,840
I just, I feel bad.

2871
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:49,920
If you're an OLR listener and I deleted you, I'm really, really sorry.

2872
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:55,520
It's just my list is full and I really, I am, but just people I know in real life and

2873
02:18:55,520 --> 02:19:00,680
actually see outside of, you know, the internet get precedence, they get preference.

2874
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:03,160
But as soon as Xbox ups the limit, open season again.

2875
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:06,640
I promise you can all at me and I'll add you back.

2876
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:07,640
Excuse me.

2877
02:19:07,640 --> 02:19:08,640
All right.

2878
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:10,600
And this person's doing this just to annoy me.

2879
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:12,320
So thank you for messing with me.

2880
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:14,600
Um, yo, OLR, what up?

2881
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:21,080
This sentience is for number four, dark Sakura to read because I'm a bad enough dude to type

2882
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:28,760
like dis grammar and all around linguistics is not my for, not me forte anyway on serious

2883
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:29,760
business.

2884
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:30,760
I have a question for Loki.

2885
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:35,080
Is it possible to hook up mix slash soundboard up to an Xbox 360 controller and play sound

2886
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:36,680
clips over Xbox live?

2887
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:42,520
Cause when I play call of duty or any game with multiplayer in it, you're usually dealing

2888
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:46,320
with 12 year olds that one out of every two words that come out of their mouth is something

2889
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:47,640
not pleasant.

2890
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:48,640
Don't get me wrong.

2891
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:49,640
I love expletives.

2892
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:53,860
Like the fuck show was funny as shit, but not racial slurs or other bigotry.

2893
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:58,800
If I can get a soundboard, I would download a bunch of sounds and just fuck with people.

2894
02:19:58,800 --> 02:19:59,960
Only dickheads though.

2895
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:04,600
Anyway, I got to go watch all the new stuff they added on Netflix like firefly.

2896
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:06,680
I heard it was really good until it was canceled.

2897
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:07,920
Well, bye bye.

2898
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:11,200
Duh money 125 and yeah, firefly is excellent.

2899
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:12,200
Watch the whole thing.

2900
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:14,120
They aired it out of order and they did it.

2901
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:17,360
They just treated it badly and then watch the movie seriously.

2902
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:21,720
Um, PS, this email is brought to you by orange knowledge radio, your number one source for

2903
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:24,320
news, previews, reviews, and talk for all things halo.

2904
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:25,320
Just kidding.

2905
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:29,200
Um, isn't that ironic considering the past email we just got?

2906
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:30,200
I know, right?

2907
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:31,200
LOLWTF.

2908
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:32,200
LOL.

2909
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:33,200
I don't know.

2910
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,840
Loki, can you hook up a soundboard to, uh, the Xbox controller?

2911
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:36,840
Yeah, of course.

2912
02:20:36,840 --> 02:20:41,560
Again, um, all you would need to do is basically just get the right, um, connector to plug

2913
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:49,360
into your, you know, Xbox 360 controller, um, to out, you know, he'd basically just

2914
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:51,800
be running a cord for your PC or whatever.

2915
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:56,360
I guess PC probably be the easiest and a rain into your controller.

2916
02:20:56,360 --> 02:21:02,640
Um, and you just need, uh, some sort of headset adapter and they actually do have, uh, one

2917
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:03,840
of those I think available.

2918
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:04,840
I'm looking here right now.

2919
02:21:04,840 --> 02:21:09,340
It looks like in tech made one of those, although I'm not sure if that just plugs, uh, converts

2920
02:21:09,340 --> 02:21:15,440
it to any headset or what, uh, that mean we could broadcast our show on Xbox live.

2921
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:18,720
Like we can start an Xbox live party and then invite people in and we could actually broadcast

2922
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,720
our show.

2923
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:20,840
You can only have so many people in your party though.

2924
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:22,400
It's like four or something.

2925
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:24,840
I wish there was a way exclusive.

2926
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:28,440
Could we, could we like get, just get in a halo match and just stand there or stand where

2927
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:36,800
no one can, can shoot us somehow and just do our show on red versus blue style possible.

2928
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:39,360
I think this though would work.

2929
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:41,240
Um, I'm not positive.

2930
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:44,960
It says it's an Xbox 360 headset adapter from in tech.

2931
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:55,120
It says allow you to plug in any, um, uh, 2.5 millimeter Jack plug, um, and I think

2932
02:21:55,120 --> 02:22:01,640
I got, I don't remember, you know, what size, uh, uh, Jack plugs there are for different

2933
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:02,640
things.

2934
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:08,300
Um, I'm sure though, seriously though, you can probably go online or even to like radio

2935
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:11,920
shack or something like that and just basically bring your controller with you and you can

2936
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:14,160
probably find some sort of an adapter.

2937
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:20,560
Or if you want, use this adapter with a converter to convert it to the correct, um, size that

2938
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:21,560
you need.

2939
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:25,920
So, um, and it does have like a volume and mute controls on there as well.

2940
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:29,960
So if you want to shut it off, so you know, you're not bugging everybody, you can do that.

2941
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:30,960
Hmm.

2942
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:36,120
I've wanted to do that as well cause I think it'd be funny just to play stuff over live,

2943
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:39,000
but uh, some people don't like that.

2944
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,000
That's actually not the only way you can do that.

2945
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:46,320
There's another way you can actually do it, um, and I've seen it happen and I was going

2946
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:49,440
to call somebody to talk about it, but they're testing, I'll come back to this.

2947
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:51,000
I want to come back to this topic in just a minute.

2948
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,480
So DarkSakura, do the next email.

2949
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:54,960
Oh, we only have one more email.

2950
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:55,960
Okay.

2951
02:22:55,960 --> 02:23:00,560
So, um, moving forward, and haha, funny to money.

2952
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:05,120
Rob said something like, most DS owners are kids, and this is by the way from Robaba.

2953
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:08,720
At first I thought, no, but if you really think about it, what is the most kid friendly

2954
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:10,260
game console around?

2955
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:13,440
By kid friendly, think about these factors and not the M ratings.

2956
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:14,440
1.

2957
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:15,440
You can put it in your pocket.

2958
02:23:15,440 --> 02:23:18,960
PSP Go and the iPhone slash iPod touch are the only others.

2959
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:22,320
The DS is the only system that protects its own screen without peripherals.

2960
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:23,640
Very pocket friendly.

2961
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:24,640
2.

2962
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:25,640
Kids are destructive.

2963
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:26,640
Part 1.

2964
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:29,680
The portable system will probably get destroyed or lost at some point, which is the cheapest

2965
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:32,440
to replace, hence its initials are DNS.

2966
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:33,440
3.

2967
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:34,440
Kids are destructive.

2968
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:35,440
Part 2.

2969
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:38,160
The games are solid state chips as opposed to UMDs.

2970
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:41,920
UMDs get crushed easily, whereas the DS chips survive most falls and step-ons.

2971
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:42,920
4.

2972
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:44,720
Parents are cheap.

2973
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:46,120
Most of the cheap games are on the DS.

2974
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:49,120
I'm still waiting for Imagine Having Fun.

2975
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:50,120
5.

2976
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:52,160
DS has buttloads of simpler games for the very young.

2977
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:56,360
I have to admit I used these priorities to pick a DS over the PSP for the nephews when

2978
02:23:56,360 --> 02:24:00,280
they were younger, so I'm inclined to believe you were right for your comment.

2979
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:02,400
Did I send this email back in 2005?

2980
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:03,720
Kinda deja vu moment for me.

2981
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:05,280
Of course I was right.

2982
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:09,360
Poor Jamie, I just wanted to jump through the internet time machine and buy her soup.

2983
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:10,360
Aww.

2984
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:12,640
I hope you were surviving your allergies slash plague.

2985
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:13,640
Rubba buh.

2986
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:20,600
Um, yeah, it was funny, I had bad allergies, and then, um, I was sick, I ate a lot of cake.

2987
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:21,720
And beer.

2988
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,860
And then, um, yeah, I was actually sick.

2989
02:24:23,860 --> 02:24:24,860
This time around.

2990
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:26,920
So, thank you Rubba buh.

2991
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:30,240
Thank you, and thank you for saying I was right, because more people should do that,

2992
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:31,240
actually.

2993
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:32,240
Say I was right.

2994
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:36,440
No, but I mean, I think you further just proved the point, though, is that, you know, all

2995
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:42,160
those things you named about how it fits in the pocket, you know, it's true.

2996
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:46,240
A lot of kids play those DSes.

2997
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:51,240
It'll be interesting to see how the three DS impacts things, if at all.

2998
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:53,200
But we'll see.

2999
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:58,920
If they're the right games for it, they might be, you know, it might pick up, you know,

3000
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:02,760
with the other crowds that are kind of into the more hardcore stuff.

3001
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:03,760
Was that it for emails?

3002
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:04,760
I said there were only three.

3003
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:05,760
That's it?

3004
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:06,760
We're done?

3005
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:08,480
Well, I wasn't listening to you, as usual.

3006
02:25:08,480 --> 02:25:09,480
Mailbag?

3007
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:14,200
Do not, do not make me break out Shermie's butt for you to bite.

3008
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:18,280
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com She's just giving you an offended look right

3009
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:19,280
now.

3010
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:20,280
Is she?

3011
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:21,280
Yeah.

3012
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:22,280
I'm looking.

3013
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:23,280
Hey girl, how you doing?

3014
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,280
Meow meow.

3015
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:25,280
She's like, bitch.

3016
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:28,200
Wait, let me see if I can get a picture of Shermie right now.

3017
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:29,200
Hold on.

3018
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:30,200
Someone fill time.

3019
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:34,920
I'm propping a logo right now because apparently people don't know the concept of sending me

3020
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:39,960
an individual zip, you know, a zip file with like, my logo's already JPEG-didded.

3021
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:41,960
So I have to do it all myself.

3022
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:42,960
No.

3023
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:43,960
Actually, I have no problem doing this.

3024
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:49,080
Rob is seriously taking a picture of this little fat butt down there, looking at him

3025
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:51,440
all offended, sitting on her little throne.

3026
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:52,440
I got a picture of it.

3027
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:55,760
I'm gonna totally, I'm gonna totally post that on the, uh, Orangeloungeradio picture

3028
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:56,760
feed here.

3029
02:25:56,760 --> 02:25:57,760
Rob's gonna totally do it.

3030
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:58,760
All right.

3031
02:25:58,760 --> 02:25:59,760
Look.

3032
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:00,760
Oh my God, Rob.

3033
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:01,760
Oh my God.

3034
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:02,760
I'm gonna totally do it.

3035
02:26:02,760 --> 02:26:03,760
Okay.

3036
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:04,760
Hold on.

3037
02:26:04,760 --> 02:26:05,760
Because we're getting that call.

3038
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:06,760
I want to take this earlier.

3039
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:07,760
This is back on the email about how do I hook up the soundboard for the 360.

3040
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:10,200
So, um, I wanted to invite SSJ 100 Matt on the show to talk about this for a minute.

3041
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:11,200
And there's a reason why.

3042
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:12,200
Matt, you there?

3043
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:13,200
Oh yes, I'm here.

3044
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:14,200
How you doing, Matt?

3045
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:15,200
I'm doing good.

3046
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:19,720
Now, the reason why I invited specifically SSJ 100 Matt on the show is A, he's a cool

3047
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:23,880
guy, but B, no, the reason why, you might remember a couple of weeks on the show and

3048
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:27,120
maybe you don't remember because maybe you want to send the email if you remember this,

3049
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:32,040
but I was talking about, I'm just kidding, playing perfect dark with the folks on under

3050
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:33,040
sedation live.

3051
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:38,280
And it was the week that the, um, Xbox live had the release of perfect dark and it was

3052
02:26:38,280 --> 02:26:43,200
like me and Alan were playing in one place and then, uh, Travis was playing and John

3053
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:44,200
was playing.

3054
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:48,200
And then some of our listeners that we have in common, like Matt, Misty and so forth were

3055
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:49,200
playing.

3056
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:50,200
Well, okay.

3057
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:54,280
When Matt joined our game, hilarity ensued because Matt was playing these sound clips

3058
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:58,320
from like Duke Nukem and like, I don't know what else is in there, like probably old movies

3059
02:26:58,320 --> 02:26:59,320
and stuff.

3060
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:00,320
Do we have my favorite one?

3061
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:01,320
What?

3062
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:02,320
Your face, your ass.

3063
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:03,320
What's the difference?

3064
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:04,320
Probably.

3065
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:05,320
Probably.

3066
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:06,440
I don't remember, but it was a hilarious epic match.

3067
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:11,200
So SSJ 100 Matt, you were somehow putting in sound clips and our email or what?

3068
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:14,320
Our email or wanted to trash talk 12 year olds or something like that.

3069
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:15,320
I believe.

3070
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:16,320
Okay.

3071
02:27:16,320 --> 02:27:19,000
So SSJ 100 Matt, you didn't hook up a soundboard and all this stuff, did you?

3072
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,520
No, you know, I didn't really didn't do anything that complicated.

3073
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:28,360
What I got was basically something that you could just buy like in the store.

3074
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:29,360
Hold on.

3075
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:30,360
You're really, really quiet.

3076
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:31,360
Can you get a little close to your microphone?

3077
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:32,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

3078
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:33,360
That's all right.

3079
02:27:33,360 --> 02:27:34,360
Ooh, much better.

3080
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:35,360
Yep.

3081
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:36,360
Yeah.

3082
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:41,680
Basically what I got here is a device called the Datel trash talker.

3083
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:42,680
I've seen that.

3084
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:44,280
It's actually called the trash talker.

3085
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:45,280
Okay.

3086
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,280
And?

3087
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:47,280
Yeah.

3088
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:52,600
And not to be confused with the knockoff version called the smack talker, which is crap.

3089
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:53,600
Okay.

3090
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:56,600
So you want the trash, not the smack.

3091
02:27:56,600 --> 02:27:57,600
Very important.

3092
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,320
Yes.

3093
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:08,840
Basically what it is is a little device that connects directly into your Xbox 360 controller.

3094
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:13,560
It comes with software and basically in a USB cable it connects directly into your computer

3095
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:20,720
and basically you take sound clips, wave clips, MP3s and just drop it into each bank.

3096
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:31,000
Now it has four banks and four sets that you can use, but it also has a preset limit as

3097
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
to what you can put on there.

3098
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:37,080
It doesn't say in the instructions or anything, but it will give you a small progress bar.

3099
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:39,640
You can't put long monologues and things in the buttons.

3100
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:41,640
There is a limit to the space on the thing.

3101
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:48,720
Yeah, you can, but you can only just take up more space on it.

3102
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:49,720
Gotcha.

3103
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:52,360
So, I kind of want to get one of these.

3104
02:28:52,360 --> 02:28:53,360
I do.

3105
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:54,360
I think I'm going to get one of these.

3106
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:56,040
But it's a great alternative to the sound board.

3107
02:28:56,040 --> 02:29:00,660
You can just dump these files from your computer right onto the trash talking device, hit the

3108
02:29:00,660 --> 02:29:03,360
button and drop in sound clips left and right.

3109
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:04,840
Your very own personal sound board.

3110
02:29:04,840 --> 02:29:05,840
Yeah, basically.

3111
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:09,580
I mean, I don't know how it sounds on the other people's end, but according to you guys

3112
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:10,580
it sounds really...

3113
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:11,580
It's hilarious.

3114
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:13,440
It sounds just like somebody's dropping the sound file in.

3115
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:15,360
Like I thought I was playing Duke Nukem for a minute.

3116
02:29:15,360 --> 02:29:16,360
It's great.

3117
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:19,720
I think what I'm going to do, I'm going to get this, but instead of putting in clips

3118
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:24,160
from Duke Nukem and stuff, I think I'll go to the Disney channel and get clips from That's

3119
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:29,400
So Raven and play those with people when I'm playing shooting matches and stuff.

3120
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:35,720
But you know, it's funny, I mostly use it whenever I'm playing Mom Warfare 2.

3121
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:39,560
And whenever I play the Duke Nukem clips, a lot of the younger kids, they don't know

3122
02:29:39,560 --> 02:29:40,560
who Duke Nukem is.

3123
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:41,560
They don't understand.

3124
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:47,640
So what they think is, they think it's some 40 year old guy who's smoked a packed cigarette

3125
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:51,920
since he was five.

3126
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:53,160
Just talking trash.

3127
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:54,160
That's great.

3128
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:55,160
I love this.

3129
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:59,080
Act Deft in our chat room just linked us to where you can buy this thing on amazon.com

3130
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:03,360
and I love I'm looking at the box art of this thing here and the guy's just got this grin

3131
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:05,880
on his face.

3132
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:07,480
And it's trash talk.

3133
02:30:07,480 --> 02:30:09,660
Taunt your opponents at the touch of a button.

3134
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:11,160
Don't get lost for words.

3135
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:12,160
It's bad.

3136
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:13,160
Oh, really?

3137
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:16,520
It has it available on Amazon.

3138
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:18,760
You can get it on Playasia.

3139
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:19,920
But you know, it's a little more expensive.

3140
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:22,620
I think I got it for like 15 bucks.

3141
02:30:22,620 --> 02:30:23,620
Order in bulk though.

3142
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,620
Just go on eBay.

3143
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:25,620
I bet it's on eBay.

3144
02:30:25,620 --> 02:30:26,880
And warning, it's a choking hazard.

3145
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:27,880
They're small parts.

3146
02:30:27,880 --> 02:30:28,880
But you know.

3147
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:30,760
You know what, that was for real.

3148
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:32,240
Okay, well, Matt, I appreciate it.

3149
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:35,760
I know I asked you last minute to kind of hop on the show and tell us about that a little

3150
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:38,240
bit, even though I think you might have mentioned on the show before, but whatever, obviously

3151
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:39,560
our emailer didn't hear it.

3152
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:41,600
So it was worth talking about again, because it was so damn funny.

3153
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:42,600
All right.

3154
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:45,560
Also, do you want me to mention about the Phillips thing or I'll just call back during?

3155
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:46,560
Oh, sure.

3156
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:47,560
What the hell?

3157
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:48,560
Why don't you tell us now?

3158
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:49,560
What's your rant on Phillips?

3159
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:51,160
The TV question we had earlier.

3160
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:56,800
Well, you know, basically like two years ago for my birthday, my father gave me an HDTV,

3161
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:58,680
Phillips HDTV for my birthday.

3162
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:01,800
And it had a warranty.

3163
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:08,360
But after the warranty expired, the TV basically crapped out a month after the warranty ended.

3164
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:12,320
So basically I had to call the Phillips, ask them what to do.

3165
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:14,840
They said, basically, it's out of warranty.

3166
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:18,880
We can't do anything about it.

3167
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:20,760
Tough shit, have a nice life, LOL?

3168
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:21,760
Basically?

3169
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:25,600
Yeah, pretty much, you know, they tell you to take it to a repair shop, you know, taking

3170
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:27,600
a HDTV to a repair shop.

3171
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:32,280
That's basically you're going to have to buy a brand new TV.

3172
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:35,920
That would irritate me to buy a new TV and then have a break just a year later.

3173
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:41,640
Yeah, but you know, the problem was, you know, it works now, but I have to let it warm up

3174
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:44,880
for half an hour before I could use it, which is a pain in the ass.

3175
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:49,640
But it turned out that the problem was there's a short, there's a short somewhere in the

3176
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:53,320
circuit board, which is common for some of their TVs.

3177
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:55,400
I don't know if it's common with their current stuff.

3178
02:31:55,400 --> 02:32:02,320
I don't know, maybe they fixed the problem two years after the fact, but I mean, that's

3179
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:04,720
my problem with Phillips.

3180
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:11,920
All right, well, so noted, so I will definitely take that into consideration before I spend

3181
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:13,520
a lot of money on a television.

3182
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:16,320
But again, like I said before, what I really need to do is get the car.

3183
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:21,080
So when I get the car, then I'll worry about the TV because the TV I have is not bad.

3184
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:22,080
All right.

3185
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:23,080
But we have something for you.

3186
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:24,080
Oh, yes.

3187
02:32:24,080 --> 02:32:25,080
Matt, before I...

3188
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:26,080
Oh, go ahead.

3189
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:32,680
Yeah, because I'm kind of in the same position, you know, an HDTV no matter how great it is,

3190
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:33,680
can't drive you to work.

3191
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:34,680
Exactly right.

3192
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:35,680
Exactly.

3193
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:38,160
Well, Matt, before we let you go, because we got to finish up the show, other people

3194
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:42,520
are calling in because they think it's a Skype segment now, oops, but before we got to get

3195
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:45,720
back to the show, but I wanted to leave you with one little thing, Matt, before we let

3196
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:46,720
you go.

3197
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:47,720
Yes.

3198
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:54,080
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

3199
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:55,080
Have a good night, Matt.

3200
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:56,080
You're welcome.

3201
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:57,080
Thanks.

3202
02:32:57,080 --> 02:32:58,080
Thanks for letting us pick on you.

3203
02:32:58,080 --> 02:32:59,080
All right.

3204
02:32:59,080 --> 02:33:07,920
What's really hilarious is to get, like, what was it, that clip from Heavy Rain, Jason,

3205
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:09,480
Jason, Jason.

3206
02:33:09,480 --> 02:33:16,960
I remember, though, you used to be able to put your own voice macros in.

3207
02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:20,600
You know, like, we did one, what are you, the poster child for abortion or something,

3208
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:21,600
you know.

3209
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:22,600
Anyway.

3210
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:29,060
What you need to do is also get, like, the CSI Miami, you know, that little musical bit

3211
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:31,320
there in the beginning of the song.

3212
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:32,320
Yeah.

3213
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:35,080
I wonder if this is the video, uh, that dark sucker might be referring to.

3214
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:58,920
I don't know if this is what video, oh, no, I was your partner, oh, that'd be awesome.

3215
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:03,400
Oh, these guys are filming the TV, it's not a direct feed, let me see if this is a direct

3216
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:04,400
feed here.

3217
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:05,400
This is the last one, I promise.

3218
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:06,400
Oh, fancy.

3219
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:07,400
Screw you.

3220
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:08,400
Got some shoes for Sean.

3221
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:09,400
Can you watch Jason for a minute?

3222
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:10,400
I promise, he won't be long.

3223
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:11,400
Sure, no problem.

3224
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:18,400
Oh, God, we don't know where this is going.

3225
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:19,400
Jason.

3226
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:20,400
Jason.

3227
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:21,400
Jason.

3228
02:34:21,400 --> 02:34:35,200
And there's a little X with Jason floating around, so I guess you just press X to say

3229
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:36,200
Jason.

3230
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:39,200
Jason, you really shouldn't want her off like that, you know?

3231
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:40,200
All right.

3232
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:41,200
You fail at parenting.

3233
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:44,320
That was, uh, that was a Flash game, too, press X to Jason.

3234
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:45,320
Was it?

3235
02:34:45,320 --> 02:34:46,320
Jason.

3236
02:34:46,320 --> 02:34:47,320
Loki.

3237
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:49,320
All right, there's the door, keep opening.

3238
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:51,640
Loki.

3239
02:34:51,640 --> 02:34:52,640
All right.

3240
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:53,640
Oh, bye.

3241
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:56,960
All right, let's get into the FUs of the week, because sometimes we get a little angsty on

3242
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:57,960
the show.

3243
02:34:57,960 --> 02:35:01,080
You know, when I can't find Jason, I get a little upset, so I want to do some ranting

3244
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:02,080
on the show.

3245
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:05,080
So here we go, the FUs of the week.

3246
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:22,800
FU to being pretty sick over the past few days.

3247
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:30,560
I feel a lot better today, although my voice is starting to go again, but I really, I really

3248
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:37,240
not like, I enjoy the projects I'm doing, but FU to this not being my job.

3249
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:41,520
You know, to me not being able to freelance full time.

3250
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:43,360
I need to be a design diva.

3251
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:48,840
They need to pay me for being awesome.

3252
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:52,040
If Lady Gaga can do it, so can I.

3253
02:35:52,040 --> 02:35:59,680
If she can walk around and call herself performance art, I can put something on a piece of paper

3254
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:02,600
and be called a design diva.

3255
02:36:02,600 --> 02:36:04,400
Would you get your own show called Designing Women?

3256
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:07,200
I'd be Designing Divas.

3257
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:08,200
Low key.

3258
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:13,120
That show would be more interesting if it was from the perspective of, say, a grand

3259
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:15,600
deity like God or something.

3260
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:16,600
Designing Women.

3261
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:17,600
Yeah.

3262
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:20,600
It would be a weird science.

3263
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:21,600
Weird science.

3264
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:22,600
Awesome.

3265
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:23,600
I like that.

3266
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:30,120
FU to my weed eater, or weed whacker, I guess, for shooting fire.

3267
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:34,960
Apparently, it's not supposed to be doing that, so it is now broken.

3268
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:38,040
It was very unfortunate that it...

3269
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:40,280
Weed eaters do not shoot fire, just for the record.

3270
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:41,280
That's not an added benefit.

3271
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:42,280
Pretty sure.

3272
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:47,360
There was a lot of smoke and then fire came out and I'm like, I think this is broken.

3273
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:54,680
So yeah, the engine overheated and melted down, so that's too bad.

3274
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:55,680
My FU of the week.

3275
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,680
I don't...

3276
02:36:56,680 --> 02:36:57,680
Actually, things are pretty good right now.

3277
02:36:57,680 --> 02:36:58,680
I can't complain.

3278
02:36:58,680 --> 02:36:59,680
I don't have a lot of negative stuff going on.

3279
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:05,320
I will take this opportunity to take a tangent, though, and this is actually gaming related.

3280
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:06,320
So...

3281
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:07,320
Not from Sorting Glue?

3282
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:09,120
No, not from Sorting Glue.

3283
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:10,120
World of Warcraft.

3284
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:14,040
No, I'm not giving you, my FU, to World of Warcraft, but I am a little bit.

3285
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:19,200
You might have heard this week, they put some new items on sale, and you can get a new $10

3286
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:22,440
pet called Little XT, which is one of the raid bosses later in the game.

3287
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:23,440
Whatever.

3288
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:24,440
They've done the pet thing before.

3289
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:31,520
But one of the other things they decided to sell was a Celestial Horse mount for $25.

3290
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:39,120
That's right, 25 real life dollars would buy you this mount in game that, you know, granted

3291
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:47,320
it has its own statistics or whatever, that you can, the mount scales with you, you know,

3292
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:50,440
whatever your riding level happens to be in the game is what the mount will be, and so

3293
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:51,680
on and so on.

3294
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:57,200
But it's $25, and it doesn't really enhance anything.

3295
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:00,560
You're not getting anything special that you can't, like, earn, you know, through other

3296
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:02,060
means or what have you.

3297
02:38:02,060 --> 02:38:05,040
It's really just the ultimate vanity item.

3298
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:09,200
And I have to admit, there was a part of me that was like, oh, that's kind of cool.

3299
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:11,160
I kind of want to get one of those.

3300
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:14,400
But then I was like, but really, $25?

3301
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:20,000
That's like almost like half of what the new expansion is going to cost for WoW.

3302
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:21,960
Cataclysm's going to cost that much money.

3303
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:26,400
Well, sure enough, all these stories start popping up.

3304
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:33,620
The queues on Blizzard's store just to buy My Little Magical Star Pony was like four

3305
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:36,360
hours long, 17,000 people deep.

3306
02:38:36,360 --> 02:38:39,360
You would have thought BlizzCon tickets went on sale again.

3307
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:44,160
And I log into the, all I had to do to convince myself I don't want a magical star pony was

3308
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:47,700
to log into the game and go to Dalaran.

3309
02:38:47,700 --> 02:38:51,040
Everybody has a magical star pony.

3310
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:57,760
Blizzard this week cooked up free money for their game, literally free money.

3311
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:01,600
It's a test because you have to understand Blizzard is owned by Activision.

3312
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:07,360
Activision loves money and Activision likes putting out map packs for $15.

3313
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:10,000
Mark my words.

3314
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,280
Mark my words.

3315
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:17,720
When Blizzard puts out the item, I'm whatever they want to do vanity and people are whatever

3316
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:19,000
enough to buy it, then whatever.

3317
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,000
And you know what?

3318
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,000
I'm not perfect.

3319
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I bought the panda thing when it came out.

3320
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:25,940
I kind of regret doing so after the fact, but I don't because it was charity.

3321
02:39:25,940 --> 02:39:28,360
So I'm like, okay, at least in the end it was charity.

3322
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:31,920
But after I bought it, I have to admit, I did have a little bit of buyer's remorse of,

3323
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:33,340
you know, that was kind of stupid.

3324
02:39:33,340 --> 02:39:34,640
Everybody has one of these pandas.

3325
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:37,120
I don't, I don't, I'm not actually going to use it that much in game.

3326
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:42,000
This was a stupid vanity thing, but at least it was charity.

3327
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:46,040
But never again am I making that mistake, but mark my words, the minute Blizzard releases

3328
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:51,680
something that does enhance your stats or does give you an enhancement or especially

3329
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:55,360
something you can't get through the game through other means, I quit period.

3330
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:59,560
I'm done with wow, when that happens, because as far as I'm concerned at that point, wow

3331
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:04,080
has become Farmville at that point.

3332
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:07,080
Tell me the difference between wow and Farmville when that happens.

3333
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:09,080
Facebook integration.

3334
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:10,920
No wow has that now too.

3335
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:14,600
You can't play wow on Facebook, but there is an official wow application.

3336
02:40:14,600 --> 02:40:20,160
So as soon as that happens, which I'm afraid is now after seeing how well this pony is

3337
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:24,360
done and exactly what Loki says is in the not too distant future, I quit.

3338
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:31,120
I'm done with wow because it is, it's kind of insane in some ways that Blizzard probably

3339
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:37,000
sold easy, a half million of these Blizzard made a million dollars.

3340
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:38,000
No more than that.

3341
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:41,160
Blizzard probably made $10 million this week, right?

3342
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:43,360
25 times half a million would be about what?

3343
02:40:43,360 --> 02:40:44,360
12.5 million, right?

3344
02:40:44,360 --> 02:40:46,200
What will you play?

3345
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:47,200
I don't know.

3346
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:48,200
Something else.

3347
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:49,200
Please Star Trek Online with me.

3348
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:50,200
Final Fantasy 14 for one.

3349
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:51,200
But we'll see.

3350
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:52,860
I don't know if Star Trek Online does the same thing.

3351
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:55,540
And no MMO am I going to do that with.

3352
02:40:55,540 --> 02:40:59,440
What Star Trek Online does, I'll tell you, and I actually like this with the Cryptic

3353
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:00,440
store.

3354
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:04,920
You buy points and you've got them for whatever you want them for.

3355
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:11,880
What I bought was, um, I actually bought the ability to play a Klingon on the Federation

3356
02:41:11,880 --> 02:41:16,200
side, play a Ferengi because they've each got their own bonuses, their own special abilities

3357
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:19,880
because this might be something that I want and I'm kind of a weird completionist.

3358
02:41:19,880 --> 02:41:22,040
But I liked that.

3359
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:27,120
I liked that you could pay, you know, you could pay to, um, to respect.

3360
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:31,800
If you've completely through barred everything, you could pay to respect and, and it's, it's

3361
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:33,440
not even a lot of points.

3362
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:38,760
I've only spent $20 in buying points and I still have some left and I've gotten all this

3363
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:39,760
stuff.

3364
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:40,760
They make it affordable.

3365
02:41:40,760 --> 02:41:41,760
So.

3366
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:42,760
All right.

3367
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:46,040
I gotta, I gotta give some comments in chat because there's way too good comments here

3368
02:41:46,040 --> 02:41:47,040
in chat.

3369
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:52,400
Uh, so I should pop says everyone has one, so whatever little originality your tune had

3370
02:41:52,400 --> 02:41:53,440
just got lessened.

3371
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:54,440
That's true.

3372
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:55,680
Uh, Chad 28 says cough.

3373
02:41:55,680 --> 02:42:00,240
I bought it cough, but I'm super addicted in amount or do you have, my question is though,

3374
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:03,520
do you have buyer's remorse now that you see that everyone has, I like the design of it

3375
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:04,520
though.

3376
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:06,040
I will have to say that it's a pretty Mount.

3377
02:42:06,040 --> 02:42:07,160
I will say that.

3378
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:10,040
But when I saw everybody had one, I was like, okay, whatever.

3379
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:11,800
I would rather work and get that.

3380
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:14,300
The Raven Mount is so fucking Epic.

3381
02:42:14,300 --> 02:42:15,300
It's the best Mount in the game.

3382
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:19,520
Did you, but it's a bitch, but I'm saying that this is though, no, I said, did you see

3383
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:22,920
the link in the chat where they made $2 million in four hours?

3384
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:25,200
God, I'm not surprised.

3385
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:29,440
I do have to though, give them props for actually having a very unique design.

3386
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:31,920
I mean, I haven't seen anything done like this.

3387
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:35,280
Legend is that who makes an excellent point and you thought paying for horse armor was

3388
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:36,480
bad enough.

3389
02:42:36,480 --> 02:42:48,480
If you had a problem with horse armor in Oblivion and you bought this, um, um, uh, just saying,

3390
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:52,360
let's see, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, let's see, I'm looking

3391
02:42:52,360 --> 02:42:53,360
at here.

3392
02:42:53,360 --> 02:42:56,840
Um, other chat rooms, chat, that orange laundry.com.

3393
02:42:56,840 --> 02:43:03,660
If you want to look, uh, let's see, as 200, Matt says, NHL 10 started letting you download

3394
02:43:03,660 --> 02:43:07,480
additional stats to your creative player for blank XBL space bucks.

3395
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:11,540
You can unlock those bonus stats in game, but they were a real pain in the ass to obtain.

3396
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:13,680
So a lot of people just bought the stats.

3397
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:16,320
You know, gyromancer has something like that too, but I don't know.

3398
02:43:16,320 --> 02:43:19,520
I somewhat give gyromancer a pass because it's not a multiplayer game really.

3399
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:22,640
I mean, I guess it does have a multiplayer mode, but it's, it's more of a single like

3400
02:43:22,640 --> 02:43:23,640
player puzzle game.

3401
02:43:23,640 --> 02:43:24,640
I don't know.

3402
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:25,640
It just seems different.

3403
02:43:25,640 --> 02:43:28,360
And by the way, horse armor does actually make sense if your horse is part of your battle

3404
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:29,360
stat.

3405
02:43:29,360 --> 02:43:33,240
Chad, Chad 28 says, there's also a rumor going around that they're going to charge 20 bucks

3406
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:34,720
a month when cataclysm comes out.

3407
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:35,720
Even I will leave.

3408
02:43:35,720 --> 02:43:39,480
If that happens, a shower ran and chat says, it doesn't matter if Rob's done with wow.

3409
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:40,960
He'll be sucking MMO cock again.

3410
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:42,960
The second final fantasy 14 comes again.

3411
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:43,960
That's true.

3412
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:44,960
True statement.

3413
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:47,200
Um, and Ziba gave a look at that link earlier.

3414
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:48,200
So there you go.

3415
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:49,200
Rama says, sky.

3416
02:43:49,200 --> 02:43:50,200
I'm going to hold you to that.

3417
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:51,200
Go for it.

3418
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:54,640
Um, there you go.

3419
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:56,640
Lots of chat comments, chat, that orange on trader.com.

3420
02:43:56,640 --> 02:43:58,540
If you want to join him anyhow, sorry.

3421
02:43:58,540 --> 02:44:01,800
That was actually my a few of the week that kind of turned into a story of its own, but

3422
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:03,440
that happens here on the show.

3423
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:06,000
Sometimes we have a couple more actual stories for you guys, and then we're going to get

3424
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:11,160
into, um, the calls of the week, one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype,

3425
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:12,160
orange laundry.

3426
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:13,160
Oh, just one minute though.

3427
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:14,160
Don't start calling yet.

3428
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:15,160
Cause we've got a couple more stories.

3429
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:16,160
Loki.

3430
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:21,720
Um, apparently the 3d games, um, are going to be coming to the PlayStation network very

3431
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:22,720
soon.

3432
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:30,700
Um, of course you probably seen commercials and stuff for 3d TVs, um, on TV, um, including

3433
02:44:30,700 --> 02:44:36,960
some from Samsung will Sony's going to be releasing their new, um, Bravia 3d TV series.

3434
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:42,480
And uh, with that will be a voucher for a, uh, kind of a free collection of games that

3435
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:49,000
are going to be, uh, compiled onto a, um, it'll either be a PlayStation network code

3436
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,320
or a compiled onto a disc.

3437
02:44:51,320 --> 02:44:57,680
And they include a wipeout HD, uh, Microsoft or not Microsoft, motor storm.

3438
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:04,640
I saw the Ms, uh, motor storm, Pacific rift, pain, um, super stardust HD.

3439
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:08,800
And um, I guess those will all be available on the places you never get at the same time.

3440
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:15,000
Now granted though, these aren't all 3d, it's kind of like portions of like wipeout HD is

3441
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,780
actually supposed to be in full 3d motor storm Pacific rift is supposed to have a level that's

3442
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:26,720
in 3d pain has, I believe three levels and not positive about super stardust HD, but

3443
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:33,280
it's kind of like a, I don't know, a little, uh, proof of concept games, I guess.

3444
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:36,360
Toa gak in our chat room says 3d is overkill out the wazoo.

3445
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:37,760
You know, I kind of agree.

3446
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:38,760
I don't know.

3447
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:39,760
I don't know.

3448
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:44,680
Then again, maybe if I play it, I'll change my mind, but I already kind of said this earlier

3449
02:45:44,680 --> 02:45:45,680
in the show.

3450
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:49,440
I just, I don't know how I feel about everything shifting towards 3d quite rapidly.

3451
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:53,680
Might I add like, it's not just happening like slowly, it's happening fast.

3452
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:56,120
It feels like 3d is taking over fast.

3453
02:45:56,120 --> 02:45:57,120
Thank you.

3454
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,120
Avatar.

3455
02:45:58,120 --> 02:45:59,120
Me.

3456
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:04,320
Just saying, by the way, do you know avatars out on a Blu Ray?

3457
02:46:04,320 --> 02:46:05,320
What?

3458
02:46:05,320 --> 02:46:06,320
The 22nd?

3459
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:07,320
It's a week.

3460
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:08,320
But what?

3461
02:46:08,320 --> 02:46:09,320
Yeah.

3462
02:46:09,320 --> 02:46:10,960
It's just the movie with none of the goodies.

3463
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:11,960
You wait till November.

3464
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:12,960
Hmm.

3465
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:13,960
Interesting.

3466
02:46:13,960 --> 02:46:15,560
Do you get the Blu Ray that comes with all of the goodies?

3467
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:16,680
Huh?

3468
02:46:16,680 --> 02:46:19,320
This is more like, okay, here's your bone.

3469
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:24,280
Well, I, I love the fact that they're marketing it with go back to the world.

3470
02:46:24,280 --> 02:46:26,760
Like they're not even trying to say, Hey, you should see this movie.

3471
02:46:26,760 --> 02:46:28,160
They're just making an assumption.

3472
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:30,560
Everybody's already seen it, which is pretty much true.

3473
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:32,760
And then of course there's going to be chatters to say, I haven't seen it.

3474
02:46:32,760 --> 02:46:33,760
I haven't seen it.

3475
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:34,760
Most people at this point have seen it.

3476
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:38,360
And then, um, they actually were re-releasing it for the weekend.

3477
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:39,360
Really?

3478
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:47,280
Um, at certain theaters for the 3d blah, blah, whatever poop.

3479
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:50,560
So are you going to pick up avatar on a, or you're going to wait, aren't you?

3480
02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:51,560
I'm going to wait.

3481
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:52,560
Yeah.

3482
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:53,560
I want the extra stuff.

3483
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:54,560
I don't care.

3484
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:55,560
I'll wait.

3485
02:46:55,560 --> 02:46:57,440
I've got avatar.

3486
02:46:57,440 --> 02:46:59,200
I mean, I, I like the movie.

3487
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:01,640
I thought it was great.

3488
02:47:01,640 --> 02:47:03,920
I see what you did there.

3489
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:04,920
All right.

3490
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:08,800
Um, let's get into one more story here and then we're going to open up the Skype line

3491
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:14,920
and uh, Oh, this is a very fitting last story of the day here on orange lounge radio.

3492
02:47:14,920 --> 02:47:20,840
Where do I even go with this?

3493
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:28,560
So there's this woman and she's from Manchester and she's talking we fit this week.

3494
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:32,440
And the reason why she's talking we fit, she's blaming it because it turned her into a sex

3495
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:33,440
addict.

3496
02:47:33,440 --> 02:47:34,440
Yes.

3497
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:37,640
We fit made me a sex addict on the next Oprah.

3498
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:39,240
It's this 24 year old.

3499
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:40,240
Her name is Amanda flowers.

3500
02:47:40,240 --> 02:47:41,240
Doesn't that sound?

3501
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:44,600
I have to say, honestly, it doesn't like, is this for real?

3502
02:47:44,600 --> 02:47:48,560
Cause isn't there a porn star named Amanda flowers?

3503
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:49,560
If not, there ought to be.

3504
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:53,840
It doesn't have like a very, it sounds like a horny name, doesn't it?

3505
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:54,840
I don't know.

3506
02:47:54,840 --> 02:47:55,840
We'll see.

3507
02:47:55,840 --> 02:47:56,840
D flowered number 50.

3508
02:47:56,840 --> 02:47:57,840
All right.

3509
02:47:57,840 --> 02:47:58,840
Well, anyhow.

3510
02:47:58,840 --> 02:47:59,840
Um, okay.

3511
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:06,380
So, uh, yeah, she fell off the balance board and she claims that because of the stumble,

3512
02:48:06,380 --> 02:48:08,280
she is now a sex addict.

3513
02:48:08,280 --> 02:48:15,240
She wants sex 10 times a day, the slightest vibration in the air.

3514
02:48:15,240 --> 02:48:19,760
She says it begins as a twinge down below before surging through my body.

3515
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:22,840
Sometimes it built up into a trembling orgasm with no cure.

3516
02:48:22,840 --> 02:48:25,880
I just have to try to control my passion by breathing deeply.

3517
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:28,520
Hopefully one day I'll find a super stud who can satisfy me.

3518
02:48:28,520 --> 02:48:30,600
And I'm thinking here, I'm like, is this a fucking joke?

3519
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:32,600
Like is April, is April fool's still happening?

3520
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:37,640
Does someone not get the memo that April fools is supposed to be stuck to April 1st but it's,

3521
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:38,840
it's all over the net this week.

3522
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:43,760
So I guess we have to treat it like I don't watch a lot of TV remember, but I watched

3523
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:51,160
an episode of CSI I think it was at my friend's house where like this teacher had ended up

3524
02:48:51,160 --> 02:48:55,960
like doing it with one of the students because she had been in an accident that messed up

3525
02:48:55,960 --> 02:49:00,440
her brain that made her addicted to sex.

3526
02:49:00,440 --> 02:49:05,280
I was like, and I just listening to this like just makes me think of that episode.

3527
02:49:05,280 --> 02:49:09,000
I'm like, did she hit her head?

3528
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:10,840
Is she just, did she fall on her cooch or something?

3529
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:12,760
No, there is actually, it's a real...

3530
02:49:12,760 --> 02:49:14,360
Did she hit herself in the labia?

3531
02:49:14,360 --> 02:49:15,360
I mean what...

3532
02:49:15,360 --> 02:49:16,360
It's a real syndrome.

3533
02:49:16,360 --> 02:49:19,360
It's a persistent sexual arousal syndrome.

3534
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:21,120
From falling off the wee balance board?

3535
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:22,120
I mean, I guess whatever...

3536
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:26,120
I hate to bring back up that episode, but it was a head trauma that did it for the episode.

3537
02:49:26,120 --> 02:49:27,120
I don't know.

3538
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:29,240
How did they pick like things that are kind of far fetched?

3539
02:49:29,240 --> 02:49:30,240
Hmm.

3540
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:33,280
Uh, let's see here.

3541
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:34,280
Are you on the Wiki?

3542
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:40,200
No, I'm on the Boston University School of Medicine's, um, sexual medicine.

3543
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:44,240
I think they're a sub, uh, page here.

3544
02:49:44,240 --> 02:49:51,400
Uh, let's see, uh, it doesn't really say what the causes are.

3545
02:49:51,400 --> 02:49:57,040
Um, it's, okay, whatever.

3546
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:58,400
So it's, it's a real thing.

3547
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:01,000
I mean...

3548
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:02,240
Head trauma and sex drive.

3549
02:50:02,240 --> 02:50:07,340
I'm immediately going to go home and fall off my Wii Fit board as many times as possible.

3550
02:50:07,340 --> 02:50:11,180
Head trauma and sex drive are connected since a person suffering from brain injury usually

3551
02:50:11,180 --> 02:50:12,880
has a reduced sex drive.

3552
02:50:12,880 --> 02:50:15,080
Um, yeah, whatever.

3553
02:50:15,080 --> 02:50:18,680
Frisbee says in chat, if hitting your head makes you a sex addict, how is this Nintendo's

3554
02:50:18,680 --> 02:50:19,680
fault?

3555
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:22,680
You know, part of me wants to say this story really has nothing to do with Wii Fit.

3556
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:23,680
Wait a second.

3557
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:24,680
You know what this reminds me of?

3558
02:50:24,680 --> 02:50:26,720
And oh my God, I can't believe I'm thinking about this.

3559
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:28,600
Don't worry, mama will fix it.

3560
02:50:28,600 --> 02:50:34,840
What was that one movie that had, um, oh my God, the guy that did Hairspray, but...

3561
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:35,840
John Waters.

3562
02:50:35,840 --> 02:50:36,840
John Waters.

3563
02:50:36,840 --> 02:50:40,040
John Waters movie where everyone was like a sexual deviant or whatever.

3564
02:50:40,040 --> 02:50:44,100
Desperate living and they go, they get exiled to the town of Mortville.

3565
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:45,100
It's really disgusting.

3566
02:50:45,100 --> 02:50:46,760
Like it's the most disgusting movie ever made.

3567
02:50:46,760 --> 02:50:47,760
Is that what it is?

3568
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:52,040
Um, I don't think it was that one, but she, like they were trying to figure out a new

3569
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:53,800
sex act or whatever.

3570
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:57,080
Oh, oh, uh, uh, you're, it's a newer one.

3571
02:50:57,080 --> 02:51:00,280
It's um, uh, damn it.

3572
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:01,480
It's the one, I know what you're talking about.

3573
02:51:01,480 --> 02:51:07,480
They had that one girl and she had ginormous tits and Tracy Ullman was in it, um, I know

3574
02:51:07,480 --> 02:51:08,480
what you're talking about.

3575
02:51:08,480 --> 02:51:13,520
It'll come a desperate, no, desperate living already said somebody in chat will get, thank

3576
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:14,520
you.

3577
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:15,520
Low down, dirty shame.

3578
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:16,520
Yes.

3579
02:51:16,520 --> 02:51:17,520
Low down, dirty shame.

3580
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:18,520
It's like dirty.

3581
02:51:18,520 --> 02:51:19,520
No, it's not.

3582
02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:20,520
Low down, dirty shame was another movie.

3583
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:21,520
Dirty shame is the name of it.

3584
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:22,520
It's dirty shame.

3585
02:51:22,520 --> 02:51:23,520
Anyways.

3586
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:28,760
Um, it's like that because that was their kind of sex act is she would, um, cause some

3587
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:34,240
sort of head trauma and then she became like a sexy deviant.

3588
02:51:34,240 --> 02:51:36,620
So yeah, that's right.

3589
02:51:36,620 --> 02:51:38,200
That was the whole point of that movie, huh?

3590
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:41,280
Tracy Ullman gets in a car accident and then like suddenly she's a sex addict.

3591
02:51:41,280 --> 02:51:42,280
Dirty shame.

3592
02:51:42,280 --> 02:51:43,280
Wow.

3593
02:51:43,280 --> 02:51:51,280
Well, I guess it's a dirty shame she fell off her Wii Fit board, huh?

3594
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:54,360
Like I said, I'm going to go home and probably try to fall off my, uh, uh, board as many

3595
02:51:54,360 --> 02:51:56,360
times as possible.

3596
02:51:56,360 --> 02:51:58,840
All right.

3597
02:51:58,840 --> 02:52:03,760
Skype line is now open one eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype, orange

3598
02:52:03,760 --> 02:52:04,760
lounge radio.

3599
02:52:04,760 --> 02:52:09,420
The phones are open for business while we wait for some calls.

3600
02:52:09,420 --> 02:52:10,720
Last minute stories.

3601
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:11,720
Anyone?

3602
02:52:11,720 --> 02:52:14,660
Gunblade is coming to the Wii.

3603
02:52:14,660 --> 02:52:18,280
They're going to do Gunblade New York and LA, um, machine guns packed together kind

3604
02:52:18,280 --> 02:52:22,520
of like what they did with, um, house of the dead two and three.

3605
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:27,960
That makes me happy because I used to play the crap out of Gunblade accuser.

3606
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:28,960
I don't remember.

3607
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:29,960
Gunblade.

3608
02:52:29,960 --> 02:52:33,200
They have like these giant machine guns that you would shoot stuff with and they would

3609
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:35,600
just constantly rumble as you're playing the game.

3610
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:36,600
All right.

3611
02:52:36,600 --> 02:52:37,600
To the phones.

3612
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:38,760
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

3613
02:52:38,760 --> 02:52:39,760
Who's this?

3614
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:40,760
Hi.

3615
02:52:40,760 --> 02:52:41,760
Yeah.

3616
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:42,760
This is spazzing you.

3617
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:43,760
Hey spazzing here.

3618
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:44,760
What is on your mind?

3619
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:45,760
My friend.

3620
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:46,760
All right.

3621
02:52:46,760 --> 02:52:47,760
Yeah.

3622
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:49,760
Uh, you know, you know, two, uh, two things.

3623
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:54,960
Um, uh, before I get to that, I just want to say I, you know, with the life story you

3624
02:52:54,960 --> 02:53:02,400
read off, I can just see every guy in America going out to store right now by we fit for

3625
02:53:02,400 --> 02:53:03,400
the girlfriend.

3626
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:04,400
Actually.

3627
02:53:04,400 --> 02:53:05,400
Yeah.

3628
02:53:05,400 --> 02:53:06,920
I was going to say, I thought you, I thought you were going to say guys are going to run

3629
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:07,920
out and buy it.

3630
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:12,440
Uh, actually most, and I, obviously I was joking earlier when I was talking about, I'm

3631
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:16,320
going to go fall off the thing, but I think most guys already are sex addicts.

3632
02:53:16,320 --> 02:53:19,080
It's just that they're going to like, they're going to get this game for their, you know,

3633
02:53:19,080 --> 02:53:20,560
girlfriends or wives and so forth.

3634
02:53:20,560 --> 02:53:26,400
And then like, you know, spray Pam all over the Wii fit board or they don't even have

3635
02:53:26,400 --> 02:53:27,400
to do that.

3636
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:31,440
I mean, obviously it's just some hard surface or something and I want to know how she fell

3637
02:53:31,440 --> 02:53:32,920
off the Wii fit board.

3638
02:53:32,920 --> 02:53:33,920
I mean.

3639
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:34,920
All right.

3640
02:53:34,920 --> 02:53:35,920
Anyhow.

3641
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:36,920
I'm sorry.

3642
02:53:36,920 --> 02:53:37,920
Spaz.

3643
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:39,720
That's probably not why you were calling it tonight, but what's up?

3644
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:40,720
All right.

3645
02:53:40,720 --> 02:53:41,720
Yeah.

3646
02:53:41,720 --> 02:53:48,840
Um, you know, you know, I was wondering if you, uh, checked out, um, you know, uh, flowers,

3647
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:54,920
the soundtrack yet or no, uh, no, I, I think I do remember reading a story that it was

3648
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:58,280
available, but flower had a great like ambient soundtrack.

3649
02:53:58,280 --> 02:54:02,560
Like that would be like, remember how we had the story earlier tonight about the, um, study

3650
02:54:02,560 --> 02:54:06,640
about modern warfare two versus, uh, March of the penguins and which won't make you fall

3651
02:54:06,640 --> 02:54:07,640
asleep.

3652
02:54:07,640 --> 02:54:10,480
Uh, the flower soundtrack will be a great thing to fall asleep to.

3653
02:54:10,480 --> 02:54:11,840
It's very nice.

3654
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:12,840
Ambient music.

3655
02:54:12,840 --> 02:54:13,840
Is that available to get now?

3656
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:14,840
Oh yeah.

3657
02:54:14,840 --> 02:54:15,840
Yeah.

3658
02:54:15,840 --> 02:54:19,600
Uh, in fact, it's been out for roughly a week and a half now.

3659
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:27,120
Uh, in fact, uh, just this past, uh, Friday, I ended up picking up, uh, just for the hell

3660
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:28,120
of it.

3661
02:54:28,120 --> 02:54:29,120
And it's, uh, pretty good.

3662
02:54:29,120 --> 02:54:30,120
Yeah.

3663
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:35,320
In fact, I, if you were kind of touching on there, uh, yeah, I, you know, ever since I

3664
02:54:35,320 --> 02:54:41,840
got it, I've been using it to, uh, fall asleep to whenever I, I get a bad case of insomnia.

3665
02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:46,200
So which is pretty much on a regular basis.

3666
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:49,280
Flower by the way, is one of the best racing games I've played in the past year.

3667
02:54:49,280 --> 02:54:50,280
Yes.

3668
02:54:50,280 --> 02:54:51,280
I consider it a racing game.

3669
02:54:51,280 --> 02:54:52,280
It plays like a racing game to me.

3670
02:54:52,280 --> 02:54:53,280
Play it for yourself.

3671
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:54,280
Find out.

3672
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:55,280
But I think it's a great support.

3673
02:54:55,280 --> 02:54:56,280
Oh my gosh.

3674
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:57,280
It's a beautiful game.

3675
02:54:57,280 --> 02:54:58,280
It's just such a beautiful game.

3676
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:03,280
You know, there was some, um, uh, controversy, I guess Ebert spoke up again about another

3677
02:55:03,280 --> 02:55:05,680
whole games as art controversy came up again.

3678
02:55:05,680 --> 02:55:07,880
He said, games are not art and they're never going to be art.

3679
02:55:07,880 --> 02:55:12,680
And it's funny because like every blog story I see reporting on the news issue has got

3680
02:55:12,680 --> 02:55:14,620
a picture of flower to go with it.

3681
02:55:14,620 --> 02:55:16,280
It's kind of like the, Oh, games can't be art.

3682
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:18,880
A so I wonder if there'll be a flower too.

3683
02:55:18,880 --> 02:55:19,880
We'll see.

3684
02:55:19,880 --> 02:55:20,880
Yeah.

3685
02:55:20,880 --> 02:55:27,720
Well, we'll probably get a flower or something, uh, you know, far too or something silly to

3686
02:55:27,720 --> 02:55:28,720
print.

3687
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:29,720
No, pretty.

3688
02:55:29,720 --> 02:55:35,880
She thinks, uh, all of these have been doing well, flower flows, so on and so forth.

3689
02:55:35,880 --> 02:55:43,240
Um, no, you know, also, um, you know, it's very, my usual day, I usually do, um, every

3690
02:55:43,240 --> 02:55:49,360
so often, uh, there's a one show, you know, uh, uh, discovered that, um, I think you guys

3691
02:55:49,360 --> 02:55:55,080
made more, uh, like, especially, um, one of the fellow, the fellow working with DJ Ramel

3692
02:55:55,080 --> 02:55:56,080
out.

3693
02:55:56,080 --> 02:55:57,080
Hmm.

3694
02:55:57,080 --> 02:55:58,080
What's that?

3695
02:55:58,080 --> 02:55:59,080
Uh, it's called, uh, Toko.

3696
02:55:59,080 --> 02:56:08,600
It's, um, it's a talk episode, uh, anime series, uh, that, uh, that's been out on cable TV

3697
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:15,280
and it's also available on, uh, Xbox live and, uh, PlayStation network.

3698
02:56:15,280 --> 02:56:18,400
It's, uh, it's kind of hard to describe.

3699
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:24,040
It's kind of like, um, a cross between the X files and devil may cry.

3700
02:56:24,040 --> 02:56:25,040
Interesting.

3701
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:26,040
Yeah.

3702
02:56:26,040 --> 02:56:27,040
Yeah.

3703
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:34,760
Yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh, well, I've seen, uh, the first four episodes so far and based

3704
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:40,440
on, you know, it's really kind of the same, uh, you know, what the whole fuse is like,

3705
02:56:40,440 --> 02:56:45,200
but just, uh, based on what level I've seen so far, it seems pretty good.

3706
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:52,920
Um, you know, there are, there are a few race here moments in there that weren't necessarily

3707
02:56:52,920 --> 02:56:58,600
great for the younger crowd, but, uh, but if you're holding off to handle that kind

3708
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:00,320
of thing, you know, it's pretty good.

3709
02:57:00,320 --> 02:57:01,960
For us mature folks who can handle it.

3710
02:57:01,960 --> 02:57:04,920
All right, well, Spaz- Spazinator, we'll have to check that out, but for now I'm gonna let

3711
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:08,400
you go, but thanks for the chat and, uh, lots of different topics tonight and you have a

3712
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:09,400
good week, okay?

3713
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:10,400
Yep, you too.

3714
02:57:10,400 --> 02:57:11,400
Take care.

3715
02:57:11,400 --> 02:57:12,400
All right, later.

3716
02:57:12,400 --> 02:57:17,920
Uh, by the way, a comment from our chat room from, uh, Seg, uh, he wants to point out that.game.company,

3717
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:21,680
the people who make Flower, they don't do sequels, but they don't fail to make something

3718
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:22,680
new and beautiful.

3719
02:57:22,680 --> 02:57:23,680
And you know what?

3720
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:24,680
I'm, I'm totally okay with that.

3721
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:25,680
You know what?

3722
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:29,960
Flower doesn't need a sequel, um, necessarily, but, uh, it would be awesome if there was

3723
02:57:29,960 --> 02:57:36,040
another game kind of in that same vein, just that very relaxing, beautiful art in motion

3724
02:57:36,040 --> 02:57:37,040
type of game.

3725
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:38,040
I don't know.

3726
02:57:38,040 --> 02:57:39,040
Whatever it is they make.

3727
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:40,040
I hope it's next.

3728
02:57:40,040 --> 02:57:41,040
Um, I'm sure it will be pretty cool.

3729
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:43,040
Anyhow, uh, let's go to the phones.

3730
02:57:43,040 --> 02:57:44,040
Hi, you're on Orange Town's radio.

3731
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:45,040
Who's this?

3732
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:47,760
You know, all this talk about sex makes me want to just sit here and play a couple of

3733
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:48,760
age games.

3734
02:57:48,760 --> 02:57:51,760
Well, hello, DJ Rama S. How are you?

3735
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:53,480
Hey, I'm fine.

3736
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:57,040
Uh, Spaznator was talking about a show he was recommending, Toko.

3737
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:59,040
Have you heard of that?

3738
02:57:59,040 --> 02:58:00,040
No, I have not.

3739
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:01,440
Hmm, you might have to ask him about it.

3740
02:58:01,440 --> 02:58:05,040
He specifically said it was for you, so, uh, and us, but he said you might get a kick out

3741
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:06,040
of it.

3742
02:58:06,040 --> 02:58:07,040
Oh, okay.

3743
02:58:07,040 --> 02:58:08,040
Yeah, check it, check it out.

3744
02:58:08,040 --> 02:58:09,040
You never know.

3745
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:11,880
Well, I'm already working a couple of anime titles right now, but that's not what I call

3746
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:12,880
it though.

3747
02:58:12,880 --> 02:58:13,880
All right.

3748
02:58:13,880 --> 02:58:14,880
Well, what's up?

3749
02:58:14,880 --> 02:58:15,880
All right.

3750
02:58:15,880 --> 02:58:16,880
Why did you call?

3751
02:58:16,880 --> 02:58:17,880
Surely you didn't call to talk about Wii Fit.

3752
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:18,880
What's on your mind?

3753
02:58:18,880 --> 02:58:24,920
Do you remember a couple of years ago, you guys talked about a Spanish DDR movie called

3754
02:58:24,920 --> 02:58:26,920
La Maquina de Bahia?

3755
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:31,020
Yes, sadly enough, I do remember that.

3756
02:58:31,020 --> 02:58:33,840
Me and my friend Jerry watched it Friday night.

3757
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:34,840
Really?

3758
02:58:34,840 --> 02:58:35,840
Yes.

3759
02:58:35,840 --> 02:58:39,880
Okay, so it's a Spanish movie about Dan Stan's revolution basically, right?

3760
02:58:39,880 --> 02:58:40,880
Not really.

3761
02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:46,860
It's the campiest feel-good movie of the year, really.

3762
02:58:46,860 --> 02:58:49,320
Of the two years ago, because the movie's been out a while.

3763
02:58:49,320 --> 02:58:50,320
Just seeing.

3764
02:58:50,320 --> 02:58:51,320
Pretty much.

3765
02:58:51,320 --> 02:58:52,320
All right.

3766
02:58:52,320 --> 02:58:57,200
I have to ask, A, what possessed you to, of all things, watch La Maquina de Bahia or whatever

3767
02:58:57,200 --> 02:58:58,520
it's called?

3768
02:58:58,520 --> 02:59:03,600
It was sitting on my computer for about a year and a half, and my roommate was playing

3769
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:09,880
FF13, and getting him off the 360 is like getting the jaws of life, so I'm like, you

3770
02:59:09,880 --> 02:59:10,880
know what?

3771
02:59:10,880 --> 02:59:14,400
We might as well just watch the movie, and it was like, wow.

3772
02:59:14,400 --> 02:59:15,400
And?

3773
02:59:15,400 --> 02:59:16,400
Was it good?

3774
02:59:16,400 --> 02:59:17,400
It was pretty good.

3775
02:59:17,400 --> 02:59:18,720
I thought it was funny.

3776
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:26,000
The part of the movie is about this kid who was playing DDR, works in a supermarket.

3777
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:30,680
His boss asks him to watch his pet snake, so he's like, yeah, sure.

3778
02:59:30,680 --> 02:59:37,000
His friends find out that he has this place on his shelf, they bring chicks over, and

3779
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,160
they find out that the snake has disappeared.

3780
02:59:39,160 --> 02:59:44,820
They run up to the back, they find the snake ate a propane gas tank.

3781
02:59:44,820 --> 02:59:49,120
When they try to pick up the snake, they drop the snake to the ground, they're like four

3782
02:59:49,120 --> 02:59:51,720
flags up, and the snake is destroyed.

3783
02:59:51,720 --> 02:59:54,280
The fuck does this have to do with DDR?

3784
02:59:54,280 --> 03:00:01,640
They end up entering a tournament to win the cash money to replace the snake.

3785
03:00:01,640 --> 03:00:03,200
Wow.

3786
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:06,360
The funny part is...

3787
03:00:06,360 --> 03:00:08,920
So it's kind of like the wizard, right?

3788
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:12,320
Weren't they entering the tournament to graze money to run away from home?

3789
03:00:12,320 --> 03:00:13,320
What were they doing?

3790
03:00:13,320 --> 03:00:14,320
I don't remember.

3791
03:00:14,320 --> 03:00:16,320
They were waiting for something, and he entered the tournament.

3792
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:17,320
Mm-hmm.

3793
03:00:17,320 --> 03:00:18,320
Right?

3794
03:00:18,320 --> 03:00:19,320
Yes.

3795
03:00:19,320 --> 03:00:21,040
I see.

3796
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:25,880
So it was basically the wizard in Spanish, but with less Power Glove and more snakes.

3797
03:00:25,880 --> 03:00:27,760
And a lot more butterfly.

3798
03:00:27,760 --> 03:00:29,760
Goody, goody.

3799
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:36,160
All right, so thumbs up or thumbs down to, let me make sure I get this right, La Magina

3800
03:00:36,160 --> 03:00:37,160
de Bailar.

3801
03:00:37,160 --> 03:00:38,160
Bailar.

3802
03:00:38,160 --> 03:00:39,160
That's how it is.

3803
03:00:39,160 --> 03:00:40,160
Bailar.

3804
03:00:40,160 --> 03:00:42,160
Yes, I'd give it two thumbs up.

3805
03:00:42,160 --> 03:00:43,160
Bailarvos.

3806
03:00:43,160 --> 03:00:44,160
Bailar.

3807
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:45,160
Bailarvos.

3808
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:46,160
Bailarvos.

3809
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:47,160
Sorry.

3810
03:00:47,160 --> 03:00:49,640
I give it two thumbs up with alcohol.

3811
03:00:49,640 --> 03:00:55,840
It's funny, so it's hilarious, drunk, because for some reason, I'm watching a movie.

3812
03:00:55,840 --> 03:00:59,280
I had this tendency to point out indifference.

3813
03:00:59,280 --> 03:01:01,960
In the movie, I'm pointing out, this is from DDR USA.

3814
03:01:01,960 --> 03:01:03,680
This is from Extreme 2.

3815
03:01:03,680 --> 03:01:04,680
This is from Max.

3816
03:01:04,680 --> 03:01:06,000
I'm like, look at the different screens.

3817
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,200
I'm like, this is from this one, this is that one.

3818
03:01:08,200 --> 03:01:09,200
And we're...

3819
03:01:09,200 --> 03:01:10,200
Ramah.

3820
03:01:10,200 --> 03:01:11,200
Ramah.

3821
03:01:11,200 --> 03:01:12,200
Sorry.

3822
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:13,200
It's because you're a nerd.

3823
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:15,260
You're a fucking nerd.

3824
03:01:15,260 --> 03:01:17,800
And I love you for it, but you're a nerd.

3825
03:01:17,800 --> 03:01:22,520
I mean, you're not supposed to do that with nerd movies.

3826
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:24,800
It's called the suspension of belief.

3827
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:31,440
Well, me because it was so campy, my eyes started looking at all the other stuff, you

3828
03:01:31,440 --> 03:01:32,440
know?

3829
03:01:32,440 --> 03:01:33,440
Mm-hmm.

3830
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:35,520
A true DDR nerd till you die.

3831
03:01:35,520 --> 03:01:37,200
I can respect that.

3832
03:01:37,200 --> 03:01:38,520
All right.

3833
03:01:38,520 --> 03:01:43,600
Anything else you wanna talk about tonight that isn't about DDR and snakes?

3834
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:47,480
Before I hang up, I want this herd.

3835
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:49,720
I'm holding you to that.

3836
03:01:49,720 --> 03:01:50,720
What?

3837
03:01:50,720 --> 03:01:51,720
About wow.

3838
03:01:51,720 --> 03:01:52,720
About wow.

3839
03:01:52,720 --> 03:01:53,720
Yeah.

3840
03:01:53,720 --> 03:01:54,720
Okay, but I wanna make it clear.

3841
03:01:54,720 --> 03:01:56,280
I wanna make it very, very clear.

3842
03:01:56,280 --> 03:01:57,280
Go for it.

3843
03:01:57,280 --> 03:02:04,400
They need to put something out for sale that is basically a way to cheat.

3844
03:02:04,400 --> 03:02:10,640
I should say that the item sale would give somebody a clear advantage just by spending

3845
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:11,640
money for it.

3846
03:02:11,640 --> 03:02:14,060
Because obviously, you can already pay for faction transfers.

3847
03:02:14,060 --> 03:02:15,280
You can pay for server transfers.

3848
03:02:15,280 --> 03:02:16,280
That's fine and dandy.

3849
03:02:16,280 --> 03:02:17,280
I don't have a problem with that.

3850
03:02:17,280 --> 03:02:18,640
I don't have a problem with vanity items.

3851
03:02:18,640 --> 03:02:25,800
I'm gonna have a problem when the item that you spend hours and hours to grind and get

3852
03:02:25,800 --> 03:02:30,500
and raid for that gives you the bonus stats to intellect or whatever is suddenly available

3853
03:02:30,500 --> 03:02:33,040
for $15 through Blizzard's website.

3854
03:02:33,040 --> 03:02:34,520
That is where I draw the line.

3855
03:02:34,520 --> 03:02:35,520
Okay.

3856
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:36,520
Alright.

3857
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:39,260
I just wanna make it very clear because I know how the listeners are and every single

3858
03:02:39,260 --> 03:02:44,120
item that comes out, they're gonna say, oh, does Rob have to delete wow now?

3859
03:02:44,120 --> 03:02:47,320
That's why I wanted you to say it so everyone's all clear about it.

3860
03:02:47,320 --> 03:02:50,440
I don't care how many magical star ponies they put out.

3861
03:02:50,440 --> 03:02:51,440
And you know what?

3862
03:02:51,440 --> 03:02:55,200
If they put out a pink pony, I might have to do it.

3863
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:56,200
I'm kidding.

3864
03:02:56,200 --> 03:02:57,200
I'm not gonna do it.

3865
03:02:57,200 --> 03:02:58,200
Well.

3866
03:02:58,200 --> 03:02:59,200
It depends on the price.

3867
03:02:59,200 --> 03:03:00,200
If it's $5, maybe.

3868
03:03:00,200 --> 03:03:03,040
But $25, that's the other problem.

3869
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:06,680
There's a big difference between 10 and $25.

3870
03:03:06,680 --> 03:03:11,860
Like $25 is like the price of a used game.

3871
03:03:11,860 --> 03:03:14,720
This just proves that people are sheep.

3872
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:16,080
And I have friends that bought it.

3873
03:03:16,080 --> 03:03:19,800
And I feel bad saying this, you know, and even a friend, a really good friend wanted

3874
03:03:19,800 --> 03:03:20,800
to gift it to me.

3875
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:24,320
And I'm like, no, please don't you don't you re no, really?

3876
03:03:24,320 --> 03:03:26,980
You really, really don't have to do that.

3877
03:03:26,980 --> 03:03:33,200
Like I would like, go buy yourself a bottle of vodka and a porno and have yourself a wonderful

3878
03:03:33,200 --> 03:03:34,200
evening.

3879
03:03:34,200 --> 03:03:38,600
Like I would rather you do that than buy me the star pony.

3880
03:03:38,600 --> 03:03:44,000
All right, anyhow, Rama, we gotta let you go try to get some more calls.

3881
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:45,000
But thank you so much.

3882
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,000
No problem.

3883
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:47,000
Bye.

3884
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
Bye bye.

3885
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:50,800
As Anakdev points out, yes, it is a big difference.

3886
03:03:50,800 --> 03:03:52,600
It sure is a big difference.

3887
03:03:52,600 --> 03:03:54,240
I hate this Skype spam.

3888
03:03:54,240 --> 03:03:56,360
Look at this.

3889
03:03:56,360 --> 03:04:01,680
European wait, this guy, this Skype spam I got European and American women are too arrogant

3890
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:02,680
for you.

3891
03:04:02,680 --> 03:04:04,720
Well, I know of one.

3892
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:10,520
Are you are you looking for a sweet lady that will be caring and understanding then you

3893
03:04:10,520 --> 03:04:11,520
came to the right place.

3894
03:04:11,520 --> 03:04:12,880
I didn't come to you, bitch.

3895
03:04:12,880 --> 03:04:15,120
You're sending me a spam message.

3896
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:16,120
Let's see here.

3897
03:04:16,120 --> 03:04:19,280
You can find a Russian lady that will love you with all of her heart.

3898
03:04:19,280 --> 03:04:20,720
Can't find a queen to rule your heart.

3899
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:21,720
How about beautiful Russian?

3900
03:04:21,720 --> 03:04:27,480
I'm going to tell you right now, well, not all Russian women are sweet.

3901
03:04:27,480 --> 03:04:31,960
I want to point out Loki married a Russian woman, not the kind that's being advertised

3902
03:04:31,960 --> 03:04:32,960
here.

3903
03:04:32,960 --> 03:04:33,960
Just so you know.

3904
03:04:33,960 --> 03:04:34,960
No, no.

3905
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:35,960
Big difference.

3906
03:04:35,960 --> 03:04:36,960
Big difference.

3907
03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:43,360
Nelly's an independent woman, but one more call.

3908
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:44,680
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3909
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:45,680
Who's this?

3910
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:48,800
One and only Legend of Zaku Zaku.

3911
03:04:48,800 --> 03:04:51,240
What is on your mind, my friend?

3912
03:04:51,240 --> 03:04:52,240
Nothing much.

3913
03:04:52,240 --> 03:04:57,320
Just like trying to spend whatever freedom I have tonight before going back, before the

3914
03:04:57,320 --> 03:04:59,360
case of the Mondays kicks in tomorrow.

3915
03:04:59,360 --> 03:05:01,680
Wait, but you're working.

3916
03:05:01,680 --> 03:05:02,680
That's good because I remember-

3917
03:05:02,680 --> 03:05:03,680
I know.

3918
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:04,680
That's the important thing.

3919
03:05:04,680 --> 03:05:05,680
Yeah, of course.

3920
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:06,680
Yeah.

3921
03:05:06,680 --> 03:05:07,680
Yeah.

3922
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:08,680
I remember a time you were calling into the show and you were like, I'm unemployed.

3923
03:05:08,680 --> 03:05:11,720
I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to do this, but then you found a job,

3924
03:05:11,720 --> 03:05:12,720
so all's better.

3925
03:05:12,720 --> 03:05:13,720
Well, I know how you are.

3926
03:05:13,720 --> 03:05:17,680
We all get a case of the Mondays, you know, no matter what, you know, it happens, it happens.

3927
03:05:17,680 --> 03:05:22,380
Even the people that are job hunting kind of go, oh God, I hope this is the week.

3928
03:05:22,380 --> 03:05:23,380
You know?

3929
03:05:23,380 --> 03:05:24,380
I know how it goes.

3930
03:05:24,380 --> 03:05:25,380
Right.

3931
03:05:25,380 --> 03:05:26,380
So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

3932
03:05:26,380 --> 03:05:28,380
Activision's bullshit.

3933
03:05:28,380 --> 03:05:30,560
That's what's on my mind tonight.

3934
03:05:30,560 --> 03:05:33,480
Is it the star pony bullshit or is it Infinity War bullshit?

3935
03:05:33,480 --> 03:05:39,400
No, it's basically their executive trying to do their best to put lipstick on a pig

3936
03:05:39,400 --> 03:05:42,780
regarding the whole Infinity War situation.

3937
03:05:42,780 --> 03:05:48,240
In particular, how he's defending that they get compensated better in Activision.

3938
03:05:48,240 --> 03:05:49,240
Hold on, hold on.

3939
03:05:49,240 --> 03:05:54,720
I'm sorry, when you said lipstick on a pig, I immediately went to that whole Sarah Palin

3940
03:05:54,720 --> 03:05:55,720
thing.

3941
03:05:55,720 --> 03:05:56,720
No.

3942
03:05:56,720 --> 03:05:58,360
The whole Infinity War issue.

3943
03:05:58,360 --> 03:06:02,040
I just, I don't know why, my mind just went to Sarah Palin.

3944
03:06:02,040 --> 03:06:04,880
I'm not trying to, I'm not calling her an idiom, I'm just saying she said something

3945
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:06,440
about lipstick on a pit bull.

3946
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:08,520
That's where my mind went.

3947
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:14,120
The idea is that Activision's trying to whitewash something, you know, basically their years

3948
03:06:14,120 --> 03:06:19,840
of trying to milk the proverbial golden calf that was Infinity Ward.

3949
03:06:19,840 --> 03:06:25,240
When you milk somebody to the point of, to the point of, you know, where you saturate

3950
03:06:25,240 --> 03:06:29,480
the market and everything else, because that's all it is, it's mediocrity, it's a race

3951
03:06:29,480 --> 03:06:32,320
to the bottom, unfortunately.

3952
03:06:32,320 --> 03:06:38,720
And in this case, Activision tries, they basically try to, you know, they're running a slave

3953
03:06:38,720 --> 03:06:44,360
ship in terms of, you know, not only Infinity Ward, but other studios that have to churn

3954
03:06:44,360 --> 03:06:48,200
out a new Call of Duty game every single year.

3955
03:06:48,200 --> 03:06:49,680
Quality be damned.

3956
03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:54,460
Well, at the same time though, Activision, their point in life or whatever is to make

3957
03:06:54,460 --> 03:06:55,460
money.

3958
03:06:55,460 --> 03:06:59,080
And there's investors that are expecting, hold on, investors expecting them to make

3959
03:06:59,080 --> 03:07:02,520
money and return on investment, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah, blah.

3960
03:07:02,520 --> 03:07:06,880
So, you know, and all these people are quitting left and right in, I believe Activision is

3961
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:11,120
based in California, which would be an at-will employment state, or wherever they are, obviously

3962
03:07:11,120 --> 03:07:14,080
they're not signed to contracts because they are quitting left and right.

3963
03:07:14,080 --> 03:07:18,120
What else can Activision do but come out and say, well, don't worry, everything's going

3964
03:07:18,120 --> 03:07:22,320
to be okay, even though they might be pooping their pants behind the scenes because they

3965
03:07:22,320 --> 03:07:24,880
have investors to make happy at the end of the day and they're going to say, of course

3966
03:07:24,880 --> 03:07:26,080
this will be a great game.

3967
03:07:26,080 --> 03:07:30,240
No, these people are just going to be better off where they're at and we're much better

3968
03:07:30,240 --> 03:07:31,240
because of it.

3969
03:07:31,240 --> 03:07:33,920
And then behind the curtain, they're like, oh, my God, what are we going to do?

3970
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:34,920
All right.

3971
03:07:34,920 --> 03:07:39,000
One thing is basically having to meet the demands of their investors.

3972
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:42,800
As a public company, they have to, but that's only short term.

3973
03:07:42,800 --> 03:07:49,520
What they should be focusing on is long-term returns, basically long-term return on investment,

3974
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:54,960
which is really hard to do because you need to be more original in terms of finding new

3975
03:07:54,960 --> 03:08:01,480
ideas that would stretch out even further, making other multi-million dollar franchises,

3976
03:08:01,480 --> 03:08:04,040
not just milking the current ones you have.

3977
03:08:04,040 --> 03:08:09,600
This is the problem with not only the business world in particular, but Activision and the

3978
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:10,600
fact that they're so short-sighted.

3979
03:08:10,600 --> 03:08:17,920
EA basically woke up from that nightmare a few years back and actually started making

3980
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:21,680
more original properties, more original games.

3981
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:26,560
And as a result, they're still a publicly traded company, but they have a lot more in

3982
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:31,000
the portfolio in terms of actually, you know, the franchises.

3983
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:35,000
And they don't basically milk them every, they don't have to meet the 10-month deadline

3984
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,760
for new games.

3985
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:40,080
So maybe this will just come full circle, Zaku.

3986
03:08:40,080 --> 03:08:41,640
I mean, you said it yourself.

3987
03:08:41,640 --> 03:08:47,160
Yeah, I'm thinking Activision has to eventually reach a point where their mediocrity is going

3988
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:48,740
to bite them in the ass.

3989
03:08:48,740 --> 03:08:49,740
And that's a fact.

3990
03:08:49,740 --> 03:08:50,740
That day is coming.

3991
03:08:50,740 --> 03:08:57,960
The day will come when people just realize that they're getting raped, they're getting

3992
03:08:57,960 --> 03:09:02,880
hoodwinked every single year with the same bullshit, with the same game that offers very

3993
03:09:02,880 --> 03:09:06,640
little in terms of fresh, you know, new content.

3994
03:09:06,640 --> 03:09:10,600
I am really curious to see what happens this year, Zaku, you know, being the music game

3995
03:09:10,600 --> 03:09:11,600
fan.

3996
03:09:11,600 --> 03:09:12,600
And I know you're in this boat too.

3997
03:09:12,600 --> 03:09:17,340
I'm very curious to see what happens at the end of the year with Guitar Hero 6 or whatever

3998
03:09:17,340 --> 03:09:22,720
they end up putting out, because you know it's going to happen, versus Rock Band 3.

3999
03:09:22,720 --> 03:09:25,640
Because especially when you take into light this whole lawsuit and all this other business

4000
03:09:25,640 --> 03:09:30,720
going on right now, I'm very curious to see how the, and I guess it's come out, the Guitar

4001
03:09:30,720 --> 03:09:33,820
Hero 5 and Band Hero and all that didn't sell too hot.

4002
03:09:33,820 --> 03:09:34,820
Of course.

4003
03:09:34,820 --> 03:09:41,240
So I'm really curious to see if Rock Band kicks it down or what happens.

4004
03:09:41,240 --> 03:09:45,200
I mean, the reason, you have to give it to Harmonix, that they actually took something

4005
03:09:45,200 --> 03:09:49,680
that has never been marketed that well, like the Beatles catalog.

4006
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:52,360
And they actually made a boatload of money as a result.

4007
03:09:52,360 --> 03:09:56,640
I know it was a license, but still, that was a major license right there.

4008
03:09:56,640 --> 03:09:59,640
Here's the first thing that they've done right so far this year.

4009
03:09:59,640 --> 03:10:05,440
It's been almost four months now, and we haven't had a guitar release yet this year, so.

4010
03:10:05,440 --> 03:10:06,440
I mean that's something.

4011
03:10:06,440 --> 03:10:07,440
Well that makes sense.

4012
03:10:07,440 --> 03:10:12,920
I mean, that and the fact that, you know, Harmonix is not like trying to claw their

4013
03:10:12,920 --> 03:10:16,280
way to get another Rock Band version out next year.

4014
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:21,880
It's been almost what, like what, almost more than a year since we had Rock Band 2.

4015
03:10:21,880 --> 03:10:26,160
And all they're doing is just shoveling new content, which is good because that's, it's

4016
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:31,800
better to, you know, keep people, have people continue buying the current version and then

4017
03:10:31,800 --> 03:10:36,720
just focusing on delivering more DLC, because that's really where they're, that's really

4018
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:41,080
the heart of the game, the music.

4019
03:10:41,080 --> 03:10:42,080
All right.

4020
03:10:42,080 --> 03:10:47,320
Uh, ZakuBuddy, we're gonna let you go, but some good thoughts on that, and we'll see

4021
03:10:47,320 --> 03:10:48,320
what happens.

4022
03:10:48,320 --> 03:10:49,320
It's gonna be very, I think you're right.

4023
03:10:49,320 --> 03:10:53,760
I think the cycle will come full circle, and somebody else will be the big bad evil dude

4024
03:10:53,760 --> 03:10:54,760
next year.

4025
03:10:54,760 --> 03:10:59,960
At least the folks from Infinity War broke out when they had the chance, and so now that

4026
03:10:59,960 --> 03:11:05,600
they're back in TGA, at least this time, they're not gonna get screwed over and be whipped

4027
03:11:05,600 --> 03:11:12,440
to, to chunk out, you know, to turn out Call of Duty games or any new IP that they have

4028
03:11:12,440 --> 03:11:13,440
every annual.

4029
03:11:13,440 --> 03:11:14,440
All right.

4030
03:11:14,440 --> 03:11:16,440
Well, we will see what happens.

4031
03:11:16,440 --> 03:11:20,160
All right, Zaku, we're gonna let you go, buddy, but you have a good one.

4032
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:21,160
Have a good one.

4033
03:11:21,160 --> 03:11:22,160
Later.

4034
03:11:22,160 --> 03:11:23,160
All right.

4035
03:11:23,160 --> 03:11:25,520
I think that's gonna do it for the Skype calls tonight, and somebody in chat making a very

4036
03:11:25,520 --> 03:11:26,520
good point.

4037
03:11:26,520 --> 03:11:29,080
Did you notice that like every New York listener got in tonight?

4038
03:11:29,080 --> 03:11:30,960
Isn't that weird?

4039
03:11:30,960 --> 03:11:35,120
Like I guess technically, technically Spaznator is in New York City, but he's in Buffalo,

4040
03:11:35,120 --> 03:11:39,480
which is still upstate New York, so, so tonight was a very New York state of mind in many

4041
03:11:39,480 --> 03:11:40,480
ways.

4042
03:11:40,480 --> 03:11:43,920
So, I don't know what you New Yorkers are doing with your phones, but y'all got it.

4043
03:11:43,920 --> 03:11:45,160
Even SSJ100Matt, we called him.

4044
03:11:45,160 --> 03:11:46,160
He's in New York too.

4045
03:11:46,160 --> 03:11:47,160
Go figure.

4046
03:11:47,160 --> 03:11:48,920
I think they just really want me to come visit.

4047
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:50,120
That's what you want, right?

4048
03:11:50,120 --> 03:11:51,400
I really want to go back to New York.

4049
03:11:51,400 --> 03:11:52,400
I really do.

4050
03:11:52,400 --> 03:11:53,400
We'll see.

4051
03:11:53,400 --> 03:11:54,400
Hopefully soon.

4052
03:11:54,400 --> 03:11:55,520
My friend doesn't live there anymore, so I have to go.

4053
03:11:55,520 --> 03:11:59,920
I'll have to crash at Rama's house.

4054
03:11:59,920 --> 03:12:00,920
See if he likes that.

4055
03:12:00,920 --> 03:12:01,920
All right.

4056
03:12:01,920 --> 03:12:07,080
So, we are going to start to wrap up here, because it's about 9.30 here on the west coast.

4057
03:12:07,080 --> 03:12:09,320
It's been kind of a long show tonight, at least three hours if not more.

4058
03:12:09,320 --> 03:12:13,940
So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight and be on our way out of here for the night.

4059
03:12:13,940 --> 03:12:16,920
So let's go around and make sure there's no more last-minute stories.

4060
03:12:16,920 --> 03:12:18,680
I don't know if Loki has anything else he wants to state.

4061
03:12:18,680 --> 03:12:21,800
Oh yeah, I got lots of stuff we can talk about.

4062
03:12:21,800 --> 03:12:27,480
Okay, first thing we're going to start off with here is, there's a possibility that there

4063
03:12:27,480 --> 03:12:30,600
might be a new Castlevania game coming, apparently because...

4064
03:12:30,600 --> 03:12:31,600
Another, another game?

4065
03:12:31,600 --> 03:12:32,600
Uh, yes.

4066
03:12:32,600 --> 03:12:35,360
This is going to be more for like a DS title or something like that.

4067
03:12:35,360 --> 03:12:36,360
Three DS?

4068
03:12:36,360 --> 03:12:38,520
Well, who knows.

4069
03:12:38,520 --> 03:12:44,220
Apparently there was a trademark registered by Konami Digital Entertainment for something

4070
03:12:44,220 --> 03:12:46,680
with the title of Harmony of Despair.

4071
03:12:46,680 --> 03:12:50,000
And if that doesn't sound like a Castlevania title, I don't know what it is.

4072
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:53,760
Yeah, it sounds pretty Castlevania to me.

4073
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:58,240
Apparently Jam with the Band on the DS is coming to Europe.

4074
03:12:58,240 --> 03:13:00,640
That game was originally only released in...

4075
03:13:00,640 --> 03:13:03,760
Didn't that come out like two years ago?

4076
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:04,760
In Japan, yeah.

4077
03:13:04,760 --> 03:13:05,760
Oh, wow.

4078
03:13:05,760 --> 03:13:06,760
Okay.

4079
03:13:06,760 --> 03:13:10,760
Yeah, it's never been released over here or in Europe, so they're going to be getting

4080
03:13:10,760 --> 03:13:11,760
that.

4081
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:15,160
And with a bunch of new songs, I guess.

4082
03:13:15,160 --> 03:13:26,020
A bunch of covers like ABC, Chariots of Fighter, I'm a Slave For You, Material Girl, among

4083
03:13:26,020 --> 03:13:27,020
other things.

4084
03:13:27,020 --> 03:13:33,160
And, of course, some Nintendo original songs including an F-Zero Medley, NES Classics Medley,

4085
03:13:33,160 --> 03:13:40,600
Legend of Zelda Medley, Super Mario Kart Medley, Super Mario Medley, and Onigashima Medley.

4086
03:13:40,600 --> 03:13:45,600
I gotta be honest, a lot of this sounds pretty good.

4087
03:13:45,600 --> 03:13:48,040
And let's see here.

4088
03:13:48,040 --> 03:13:54,520
Nintendo has actually won an appeal against Anascape in their suit saying that they had

4089
03:13:54,520 --> 03:14:03,240
a patent for, I guess, the Wave Bird and the classic controllers and whatnot.

4090
03:14:03,240 --> 03:14:04,920
So that's kind of cool.

4091
03:14:04,920 --> 03:14:08,960
Unfortunately, they have been sued again by somebody else.

4092
03:14:08,960 --> 03:14:19,280
Now, IA Labs apparently is going to be suing them because of a fitness game, Power Grid

4093
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:20,280
Fitness.

4094
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:28,240
They're saying that it infringes on their patent for it.

4095
03:14:28,240 --> 03:14:33,640
And apparently they said that they also approached Nintendo with the idea in the first place.

4096
03:14:33,640 --> 03:14:36,240
That would be interesting.

4097
03:14:36,240 --> 03:14:41,800
And lastly, there's going to be some new Xbox Live arcade games coming soon.

4098
03:14:41,800 --> 03:14:48,680
Apparently, there's information leaking out from PartnerNet, which I shake my head at

4099
03:14:48,680 --> 03:14:49,680
that.

4100
03:14:49,680 --> 03:14:58,200
So, Crazy Taxi will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade, as well as Quake Arena Arcade and

4101
03:14:58,200 --> 03:14:59,720
some other...

4102
03:14:59,720 --> 03:15:00,720
What?

4103
03:15:00,720 --> 03:15:01,720
Quake Arena Arcade?

4104
03:15:01,720 --> 03:15:02,720
Yes.

4105
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:03,720
Rad.

4106
03:15:03,720 --> 03:15:05,200
That was already announced, I think, a while ago.

4107
03:15:05,200 --> 03:15:06,200
On Xbox?

4108
03:15:06,200 --> 03:15:10,880
Yeah, it's going to have 16 player online battles with 40 original maps.

4109
03:15:10,880 --> 03:15:14,640
Get your trash talker ready, Matt.

4110
03:15:14,640 --> 03:15:18,920
Some other titles, of course, on the way that apparently are appearing on PartnerNet as

4111
03:15:18,920 --> 03:15:19,920
well.

4112
03:15:19,920 --> 03:15:28,000
Metal Slug XX, Neo Geo Battle Colosseum, Raystorm HD, Sonic Adventure DX, The King of Fighters

4113
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:37,240
2002 Unlimited Match, Quake Arena Arcade, Crazy Taxi, Bali, Card Game, and Doom II,

4114
03:15:37,240 --> 03:15:38,240
the arcade version.

4115
03:15:38,240 --> 03:15:41,440
Doom II arcade version?

4116
03:15:41,440 --> 03:15:45,520
And the first five of those titles, if you know where they'll look, have already been

4117
03:15:45,520 --> 03:15:47,520
leaked out.

4118
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:55,080
All right, very cool.

4119
03:15:55,080 --> 03:15:56,280
Lots of good stuff in there.

4120
03:15:56,280 --> 03:15:58,360
That's it for last minute stories then, Loki?

4121
03:15:58,360 --> 03:15:59,360
That's it.

4122
03:15:59,360 --> 03:16:00,360
We've had a really full show tonight.

4123
03:16:00,360 --> 03:16:01,360
It's been kind of impressive.

4124
03:16:01,360 --> 03:16:02,360
I'm really out of stuff too.

4125
03:16:02,360 --> 03:16:03,360
All right.

4126
03:16:03,360 --> 03:16:04,360
That's why I'm sitting on the floor again.

4127
03:16:04,360 --> 03:16:05,360
I know why.

4128
03:16:05,360 --> 03:16:06,360
I noticed you're working on your decoupage.

4129
03:16:06,360 --> 03:16:07,360
I am.

4130
03:16:07,360 --> 03:16:08,360
So I figured you had to be out of things.

4131
03:16:08,360 --> 03:16:09,360
Well, you know...

4132
03:16:09,360 --> 03:16:10,360
Are you going to take a status picture for our chatters to see?

4133
03:16:10,360 --> 03:16:12,080
I am once I actually have something worth the status.

4134
03:16:12,080 --> 03:16:15,960
I'm actually gluing, doing extra layers of glue on the back to hold down these loose

4135
03:16:15,960 --> 03:16:16,960
ends.

4136
03:16:16,960 --> 03:16:21,240
Um, I'll tell you, I'm actually, there's X-Box stuff I'm excited about coming out.

4137
03:16:21,240 --> 03:16:22,240
What's that?

4138
03:16:22,240 --> 03:16:23,240
Well, I want to play them.

4139
03:16:23,240 --> 03:16:24,240
We're heroes.

4140
03:16:24,240 --> 03:16:25,240
Ah, very nice.

4141
03:16:25,240 --> 03:16:28,280
I see your decoupage pictures are already up on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

4142
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:29,280
Very nice.

4143
03:16:29,280 --> 03:16:30,280
Very nice.

4144
03:16:30,280 --> 03:16:32,720
They've replaced the pictures of Matt with the double down last week, which is good because

4145
03:16:32,720 --> 03:16:33,720
I was taking a look at that thing.

4146
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:35,800
Or me with the nose pond.

4147
03:16:35,800 --> 03:16:37,560
Yeah, you with the nose pond.

4148
03:16:37,560 --> 03:16:40,880
That was really bad, but funny from that episode.

4149
03:16:40,880 --> 03:16:42,800
Oh, that was the week Loki missed.

4150
03:16:42,800 --> 03:16:43,800
Oh boy.

4151
03:16:43,800 --> 03:16:46,560
You should be very glad you had family things to tend to that night.

4152
03:16:46,560 --> 03:16:47,560
What happened?

4153
03:16:47,560 --> 03:16:53,840
Uh, Dark Sakura had this thing in her nose that she used for her sinus things and it

4154
03:16:53,840 --> 03:16:56,000
looked like she was shoving a tampon in her nose.

4155
03:16:56,000 --> 03:17:01,480
And so we were calling it a nose pond and I dared her to take a picture and put it on

4156
03:17:01,480 --> 03:17:02,720
the website and she did it.

4157
03:17:02,720 --> 03:17:03,760
I looked crazy.

4158
03:17:03,760 --> 03:17:06,920
You know that Jamie doesn't like pictures of her.

4159
03:17:06,920 --> 03:17:09,480
Like she's very picky choosy about what she lets out on the internet.

4160
03:17:09,480 --> 03:17:15,080
She's like, I'll take one cause I know I look shitty today.

4161
03:17:15,080 --> 03:17:16,080
Good times.

4162
03:17:16,080 --> 03:17:17,080
Okay.

4163
03:17:17,080 --> 03:17:18,080
We got to go around and get some final thoughts.

4164
03:17:18,080 --> 03:17:19,080
We got to close up shop.

4165
03:17:19,080 --> 03:17:22,720
We're running very late tonight and I know some folks want to go to bed before you know

4166
03:17:22,720 --> 03:17:23,720
the sun rises.

4167
03:17:23,720 --> 03:17:26,320
So I will start with Dark Sakura cause you're on the floor.

4168
03:17:26,320 --> 03:17:28,800
Uh, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

4169
03:17:28,800 --> 03:17:31,240
I like glue.

4170
03:17:31,240 --> 03:17:32,880
Loki your final thought for our listeners tonight.

4171
03:17:32,880 --> 03:17:35,560
Why is Rama coming to Sacramento and going to kidnap Rama?

4172
03:17:35,560 --> 03:17:36,560
Uh oh.

4173
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:37,560
Uh, he's coming.

4174
03:17:37,560 --> 03:17:38,720
He's coming to stay with me.

4175
03:17:38,720 --> 03:17:39,720
When is he coming?

4176
03:17:39,720 --> 03:17:40,720
I need to make sure I'm available.

4177
03:17:40,720 --> 03:17:41,720
For explosions.

4178
03:17:41,720 --> 03:17:42,720
Is Patty coming too?

4179
03:17:42,720 --> 03:17:43,720
Oh, 4th of July.

4180
03:17:43,720 --> 03:17:44,720
Right?

4181
03:17:44,720 --> 03:17:45,720
Yes.

4182
03:17:45,720 --> 03:17:46,720
That's what we should rename it.

4183
03:17:46,720 --> 03:17:50,000
You know, are they going to be here for pride the week before?

4184
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:53,160
Oh, guys need to rearrange schedule and get here the week before.

4185
03:17:53,160 --> 03:17:54,160
That's pride.

4186
03:17:54,160 --> 03:17:57,080
Rob, you need to, you need to take me cause I haven't been to a function yet.

4187
03:17:57,080 --> 03:17:58,080
It'll be fun.

4188
03:17:58,080 --> 03:18:00,120
All I've been is to the street fair.

4189
03:18:00,120 --> 03:18:01,480
It's on my birthday this year though.

4190
03:18:01,480 --> 03:18:02,480
So I don't know how I feel about that.

4191
03:18:02,480 --> 03:18:03,480
I'll have to get you dinner.

4192
03:18:03,480 --> 03:18:04,480
We'll see.

4193
03:18:04,480 --> 03:18:05,480
All right.

4194
03:18:05,480 --> 03:18:06,480
Anyhow, we're done.

4195
03:18:06,480 --> 03:18:07,480
We're out.

4196
03:18:07,480 --> 03:18:08,480
Uh, my final thought is, um, I don't know.

4197
03:18:08,480 --> 03:18:12,960
Um, I just ate a whole bag of cinnamon sugar pita chips during the show cause I'm fat hot.

4198
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:13,960
All right.

4199
03:18:13,960 --> 03:18:14,960
Uh, that's it.

4200
03:18:14,960 --> 03:18:15,960
Thank you guys for being here.

4201
03:18:15,960 --> 03:18:19,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show, downloading, listening live, however

4202
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,600
you're doing it, supporting independent podcasting.

4203
03:18:21,600 --> 03:18:26,200
You know what we say every week, all we ask if you enjoy the show, tell a person, tell

4204
03:18:26,200 --> 03:18:28,720
two people, post a nice review on iTunes.

4205
03:18:28,720 --> 03:18:29,720
Just help us spread the word.

4206
03:18:29,720 --> 03:18:31,240
You know, we don't have ads in the show yet.

4207
03:18:31,240 --> 03:18:32,800
I always say yeah, cause you never know.

4208
03:18:32,800 --> 03:18:36,440
We might want to someday, but if we haven't for eight years, I mean, shit, who's going

4209
03:18:36,440 --> 03:18:38,440
to buy the ads based on the show.

4210
03:18:38,440 --> 03:18:42,560
And uh, you know, we, we, we certainly don't ask for any money from you and we're not going

4211
03:18:42,560 --> 03:18:44,600
to ask for any money from you to do this show or what have you.

4212
03:18:44,600 --> 03:18:46,360
So all we ask, just help spread the word.

4213
03:18:46,360 --> 03:18:47,360
That's all we want.

4214
03:18:47,360 --> 03:18:50,280
Uh, thank you guys so much for downloading and uh, wasting your Sunday evening with us.

4215
03:18:50,280 --> 03:18:51,440
We really appreciate it.

4216
03:18:51,440 --> 03:18:52,440
Have a wonderful week.

4217
03:18:52,440 --> 03:18:54,200
We'll be back to do it all again next week.

4218
03:18:54,200 --> 03:18:56,160
Yes, we'll be here next week.

4219
03:18:56,160 --> 03:18:59,800
Um, next week I've got Conan O'Brien live on Friday, so I know I'll definitely talk

4220
03:18:59,800 --> 03:19:02,880
about that even though that really has nothing to do with games, but I've done a few weeks

4221
03:19:02,880 --> 03:19:03,880
low key.

4222
03:19:03,880 --> 03:19:07,360
Low key wanted me to talk about that, so I will, um, what else is going on next week?

4223
03:19:07,360 --> 03:19:09,560
I got Rocky and, and it'll be lots of games.

4224
03:19:09,560 --> 03:19:15,240
I'm sure lots more, a magic sword, a double impact and a also world of Warcraft because

4225
03:19:15,240 --> 03:19:17,480
my characters have lots of games to play.

4226
03:19:17,480 --> 03:19:19,520
Just hit Northrend, my new set of characters.

4227
03:19:19,520 --> 03:19:20,960
So lots of fun stuff.

4228
03:19:20,960 --> 03:19:22,320
All right, we're out.

4229
03:19:22,320 --> 03:19:23,320
Have a great week.

4230
03:19:23,320 --> 03:19:24,320
We'll see you next week.

4231
03:19:24,320 --> 03:19:25,320
We'll do it all again next Sunday.

4232
03:19:25,320 --> 03:19:26,320
Sound good?

4233
03:19:26,320 --> 03:19:27,320
Good.

4234
03:19:27,320 --> 03:19:28,320
Have a great week.

4235
03:19:28,320 --> 03:19:30,320
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
