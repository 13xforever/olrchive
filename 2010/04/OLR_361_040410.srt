00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,820
Tonight, April 4th, 2010, a theft occurs at PAX East, Linux gets taken away on the PS3,

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:31,800
and Nintendo puts the snack down on the end of the whole fans were waiting for.

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,600
Hello my friends, and welcome to episode number 361 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,840
talk show where every gamer has a voice, except the host.

5
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,820
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my lovely

6
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,400
co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Uh...

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
I know, right?

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,060
We'll get into that later.

10
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,060
It's not a good night.

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,720
Seriously, we should just phone tonight's episode in.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
I don't...

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
What the hell are we doing?

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,580
We should just, like, throw the show roll in the toilet and just do whatever.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,160
If this is the first show you've ever listened to of Orange Lounge Radio, please go back

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,280
in the iTunes archives and select another, because it's just gonna be one of those nights

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
that I can already tell.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
This...

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
We had the fuck show already.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,320
This is the fuck it show.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Not here tonight.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,480
Sometimes that's some of our best work, though, so we'll see what happens.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,600
Not here tonight.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
Tagmaster Loki, sadly, is not here.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,020
I think he's got a holiday dinner thing going on, which is strange because the wife is Jewish,

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,020
but whatever.

27
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,020
There's a dinner in the...

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,020
But it may be his family.

29
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,020
No, I know.

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,020
It is.

31
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,020
I'm pretty sure it is his family.

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,020
So, you know.

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,020
And he...

34
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,020
The man deserves a night off once in a while.

35
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,620
I wonder if Nellie's observing Passover.

36
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,620
I have no idea.

37
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,620
If...

38
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,620
Well, no, she can't be, because...

39
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,620
Yeah, never mind.

40
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,620
Well, anyhow.

41
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,040
Uh, and one thing I should say about Loki, you know, I'm sure he wanted to tell you all

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
this on the show, but he posted it on Twitter.

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
And when I say...

44
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,540
You post it on Twitter?

45
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,640
CNN can report on it, so therefore it's fair game, right?

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,780
Nellie is pregnant again.

47
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,440
So congratulations to Loki.

48
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,520
The pictures were kind of scary, because I could see bones.

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,240
That's what babies look like when they're in the...

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
And they're growing inside of you.

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,160
And just so you guys know, not only is Nellie pregnant, she's, what, about 20 weeks?

52
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,880
I mean, they waited, I mean, understandably, if you don't know what happened before...

53
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,160
They waited until it was a viable pregnancy.

54
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Yes.

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,640
They wanted to wait this time to say anything.

56
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,760
So she's about 20 weeks along at this point.

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
I think they already know it's a boy, and just, it's one this time, it's not 20.

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
I saw the pee-pee.

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
So, what's that?

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,000
They pointed to the pee-pee on the ultrasound.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Did they?

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, okay, yeah.

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And the hand in the hand.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Nellie would do that.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's a very Nellie thing to do.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, no, they usually do that.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The doctors will...

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Look at my kid's penis!

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Woo!

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,360
The doctors will, like, usually point stuff out on the ultrasound.

71
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Okay.

72
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
All right.

73
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
I'm gonna make you some dinner.

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
No, but in all seriousness...

75
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Like a good woman should.

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Bite my ass.

77
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Oh, I just did that.

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,520
Actually, if you want something more disgusting, bite my sinus cavity.

79
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,640
All right.

80
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
So great.

81
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
I get to monologue with the listeners for a little while.

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
This should be fun.

83
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
No, I'll do my gaming week.

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
I can hear you from the other room, Rob.

85
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
I know you can.

86
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
And you'll hear...

87
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
We'll be good.

88
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,320
I'll talk to the chatters tonight.

89
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,880
I'll talk to the chatters.

90
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Hi, chatters.

91
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,800
So, yes, Loki is, chat.orangehonstrader.com, by the way, if you want to join our chat room.

92
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,040
There's no Loki here tonight because he's having a nice family dinner, and obviously

93
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,640
they have reasons to celebrate, so good for them.

94
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,840
He'll be back next week.

95
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,520
So it's just, right now, it's just you and me, folks.

96
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,400
You and the guys in the chat room, chat.orangehontrader.com, and we'll be opening up the Skype line a

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
little later on.

98
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,280
Now, here's the other part that's, I guess, just hilarious of what's going on right now,

99
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,660
is that I am sick.

100
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,120
You can probably tell my voice sounds a little bit out of it.

101
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,760
And Dark Sakura, you can hear her blowing her nose like in China.

102
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
Like, go download Bobby's show from this week.

103
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,440
It sounded like an earthquake going on back there.

104
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,480
So dark as she's screaming at me from the kitchen.

105
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,360
So dark, it's like, this is like the Dark Sakura and Sky are married edition.

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
What is going on here?

107
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,320
You're yelling at me from the kitchen.

108
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,640
You're cooking me dinner.

109
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,720
This is the- Rob is officially my gay husband.

110
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,280
This is definitely an April Fool's edition.

111
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,040
Rob is my complimentary spouse.

112
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Fist bump.

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,840
You just fist bumped me.

114
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,080
Rob is, Rob can be my complimentary spouse at Sam's Club.

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,240
Can I talk about fist bumping for a minute?

116
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,480
Okay, PAX East.

117
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,720
Ain't no one want to shake my hand at PAX East for whatever reason.

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,760
Now, there's a couple of people.

119
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,640
But I noticed the big thing to do is fist bumping.

120
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,680
Like that's how people say hello now is they fist bump.

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,280
And like, surely that's a sign I'm getting old is that I don't want to fist bump.

122
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,580
Like back in my day, we shake hands.

123
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,360
Like I'm not going to- But not when you're sick.

124
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,040
Well, A, I wasn't sick during the con and B, I already had swine flu in October.

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
So I'm not going to have it again.

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
I did too.

127
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Oops.

128
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm not cooking dinner.

129
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,880
I'll let everyone know what Rob is having.

130
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,360
It's the same thing I'm having.

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,640
It's an Ezekiel 4-9 tortilla, so there's no gluten and no yeast in it.

132
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,400
With some garlic hummus.

133
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
All this healthy crap.

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,560
Baby spinach.

135
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,760
Fresh baby spinach.

136
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,440
The wife's making me eat healthy tonight.

137
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
And yogurt cheese.

138
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,760
Because I will say more about this later.

139
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,120
Everyone knows I have digestion problems.

140
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,880
I think I figured out what's causing it.

141
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
All right.

142
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,280
That's right.

143
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
And Rob in the chat room says, I got it from the bean bag and shook your hand.

144
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
That's true.

145
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,640
No, it was just some people were fist bumping.

146
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:24,400
Like I don't- I met a blogger who blogs for a site that's commercial and they get paid

147
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
for it.

148
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,760
And if I told you the site, you'd all know what it is.

149
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,260
And she wanted to fist bump.

150
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,920
And I was like, oh, okay, is that how we do it back East?

151
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,760
But she was actually from California.

152
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,480
So I didn't, I didn't get it, but I guess maybe it was a virus thing.

153
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
I don't know.

154
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
I guess.

155
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
It was just weird.

156
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
It was weird.

157
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
All right.

158
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
I wasn't used to that whole fist bump thing.

159
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
I thought that's what like bros did when they were drunk.

160
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
I don't know.

161
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
All right.

162
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Anyhow.

163
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Uh, where the hell was I?

164
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
I was sick.

165
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,680
Dark soccer is sick.

166
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
We're all sick.

167
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Loki's out.

168
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Nellie's pregnant.

169
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,880
There's earthquakes going on in California right now and somewhere there will be video

170
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
games involved too.

171
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
No, seriously.

172
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
There's, there were earthquakes.

173
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,520
There were two of them in California today.

174
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,800
There was a, an earthquake in Baja, Mexico that apparently was felt San Diego, LA, like

175
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,340
all the way to Phoenix.

176
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,160
So just the whole Southwest is shaken.

177
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,960
But thank God it sounds like not a lot of people are hurt.

178
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,160
We heard from the resident Mexican actdeft on the Twitter again, I'm getting my news

179
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
from Twitter.

180
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,680
What's the world coming to actdeft apparently is okay.

181
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,920
So I know if he's okay, then it can't be too terrible.

182
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,000
So hopefully everybody is okay.

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,500
I know they build a lot of the structures down there to, I mean, it's LA we're talking

184
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
about.

185
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,340
So there's a lot of structural integrity down there.

186
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,680
So hopefully everybody's okay.

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,960
What I didn't know at the same time, apparently nine minutes later, an aftershock of some

188
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
sort hits in NorCal.

189
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,700
Now I'm on the road and I don't know if you know this, but if you're sitting in a car,

190
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,000
you can't feel an earthquake while you're driving.

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,560
So if an earthquake happened, I didn't feel it, but it was also only like a 4.1 earthquake

192
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
anyway.

193
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,120
So, you know, and you can't even feel it if it's like 3.5.

194
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,960
So I wouldn't have, you know, I wouldn't have really felt it anyway, but the scary part

195
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,920
is I was sitting on the Bay Bridge right when these earthquakes were happening.

196
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,640
And I know this because my sister who is in Long Beach texted me and said, earthquake

197
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
lol.

198
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,760
So, thank gosh, I didn't like fall off the bridge if that earthquake had been too much

199
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
stronger.

200
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
So there you go.

201
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,040
All right.

202
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Some folks in our chat room are chatting about the earthquake.

203
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,760
Fernando, can you hear the drums Fernando?

204
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,720
And our chat room says, I felt the earthquake in San Diego, it was fun, meow.

205
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,480
Amesatsuma says, the earthquake turned my bed into a water bed.

206
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,200
Ray Ananami says, I was sitting, I didn't feel anything.

207
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,680
Well, it was only a 4.1, you may not have felt anything.

208
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,080
Okay, apparently, it's the earthquake show.

209
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,560
It's the freaky crap show tonight.

210
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,120
I don't know what the hell's going on tonight.

211
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,800
We're just like avoiding the topic of games.

212
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,480
All right, we can talk about games.

213
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Let's get into the show.

214
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,320
Let's start it off as we always do with a little bit of how was your gaming week.

215
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,600
And this is dark Sakura is still in the kitchen, but she's bringing ooh, yay, vitamin water.

216
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Thank you.

217
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,000
Now my, when my throat is parched, I will be able to quench it.

218
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,320
Here we go.

219
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,680
So my gaming week, I went to PAX East and hopefully you heard the lovely show that we

220
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
did last week.

221
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
It's only aired live so far.

222
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,600
It did not because I've been sick.

223
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,080
I didn't get the MP3 posted.

224
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
So I apologize.

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,560
That'll be posted to OrangeLawnTreaty.com and some of our like Facebook and all that

226
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
stuff later this week.

227
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,680
But if you didn't hear the pack show, it was a lot of fun.

228
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,720
Quite a few listeners, uh, met up with me there and it was really just cool to meet

229
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,320
everybody and you see some of the, no, it wasn't, it wasn't that silly, but you know,

230
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
we had a good time.

231
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
We had a good discussion.

232
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
It was fun.

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,560
Um, you were a miss dark Sakura as was Loki.

234
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
It was a bummer.

235
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,920
You guys couldn't make it show itself.

236
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,960
I don't know if I really actually ended up playing a lot of video games because I didn't

237
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,160
want to wait in line for an hour.

238
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,500
I will say what video games I did play classic gaming arcade, that big famous arcade they

239
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,040
have out there in the east coast fun, fun spot.

240
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
That's it.

241
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,360
Fun spot brought some of their arcade machines two packs east.

242
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,080
So I played donkey Kong three.

243
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Heck yeah.

244
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
I played that.

245
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,040
I took some pictures of pinball tables for dark Sakura on her Twitter and I played the

246
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,520
Buck Rogers arcade machine that was actually one of the sit down cabinet and that machine

247
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,960
kicked my ass.

248
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,200
So I played some classic games, but as far as, um, uh, being able to take like, uh, I

249
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,400
wasn't going to sit in an hour long line to play red dead redemption.

250
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,720
And I did, it wasn't that excited about crack down to like, I just looked over someone's

251
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,600
shoulder and I'm, I kind of got a feel for it.

252
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,280
Like I didn't like have to play it myself.

253
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
I was okay.

254
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:39,160
So, you know, but I jump in the sequel, it was, it looked like I like jumping with rockets.

255
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,600
Just people blast each other with rockets.

256
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
But you know, I had a good time.

257
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,840
I did get dark Sakura present, but unfortunately I neglected to bring it tonight.

258
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,360
But um, it involves a certain card game that people were playing everywhere up and down

259
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,520
the halls in the tabletop area.

260
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,140
And I know it's one of the dark soccer is a fan of magic.

261
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,880
I'm not telling, I'm not telling judgment, lol.

262
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,880
I wish I would've been fun, but I, I had a, I had a, um, I had a good time at packs except

263
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,960
for the omega thon.

264
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,180
Can we talk about the omega thon?

265
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,100
Cause that happened after the pack show.

266
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,120
I'm already starting to get sick Sunday and my friends that I traveled with, my dear friends

267
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,300
say and Amanda, they wanted to wait in line for the omega thon, which I'm like, okay,

268
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,680
I've never watched a final round of megathons.

269
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
I'm cool.

270
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,020
I'm like, okay, let's, let's do it.

271
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Let's sit in line.

272
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,060
Let's wait for the final round of megathon.

273
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,900
Let's watch the closing ceremony, see what happens.

274
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,200
So final round of the omega thon supposed to start at five o'clock, right?

275
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,040
Five 30 I noticed we're still sitting in line outside and we are cramped.

276
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,680
We are herded like cattle.

277
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,600
If there was a fire, we would have died.

278
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
We would all died.

279
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,480
I mean, it's just, we are in there like so tightly packed and apparently they, they posted

280
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,880
to their Twitter, Oh, we're having problems with the final omega thon game, LOL.

281
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,840
And I'm just sitting there thinking, open the goddamn theater and test behind the curtain.

282
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Let us in.

283
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm old and my bones can't take this standing around anymore.

284
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,560
So finally like five 45 they let us in.

285
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,880
We get in there, sit down, wait for things to start, which finally start around six and

286
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,480
then they're like, it's the omega thon.

287
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,120
And you know, and of course it's always this big mystery.

288
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,100
What's the last omega thon thing going to be?

289
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
What's the game going to be?

290
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Oh my gosh.

291
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,860
Well, this, this year was a team theme.

292
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,640
The whole omega thon all the way from start to finish was played in teams like little

293
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
teams.

294
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,440
They did the whole way from start to finish.

295
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,800
And so it made sense that the last omega thon game was going to be a series of games.

296
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,040
It was a relay race.

297
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,040
So the first game, super Mario brothers collect 50 coins.

298
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,960
Second game, rad racer, get 1500 points.

299
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,440
Third game, Tetris, get 10 lines.

300
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,200
At this point, I'm thinking to myself, I'm watching the Nintendo world championships

301
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,560
about 20 years late.

302
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,240
Actually that sounds like almost the exact order of a Nintendo world championship cartridge.

303
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,700
It was, it was, it was for real fun.

304
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,140
It might've been like some variation in the coin numbers and the lines, but essentially

305
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,440
it was the fricking, um, uh, Nintendo world championships.

306
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,480
But the fourth game they had said would be a co-op game and Ooh, ah, what does it end

307
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
up being?

308
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,280
It's Contra.

309
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,960
That's right, eight bit Contra was the final game and they had to play all the way to kill

310
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,880
the first boss, which apparently now when I say kill the first boss in Contra, what

311
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
does that mean to you?

312
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,960
How far would you have to play in the game to kill the first boss in Contra?

313
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:34,600
To the, through the little tunnel part and through to the like the, the very end.

314
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,720
It wasn't the, the little dinky guy sitting in front of the gate at the first stage.

315
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,920
No, see, I took it to mean that I took it to mean stage one, the end of that's the first

316
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,320
boss is the end of stage one, right?

317
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,480
No, but it was all the way to the big orb thing that goes back and forth.

318
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,540
That's really at the end of like stage two.

319
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,280
So that's how far they had to play.

320
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,560
Well, yippy, skippy, without cussing.

321
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,520
No, they could cuss all they wanted.

322
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Good.

323
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,720
Cause that game makes me cuss from the very beginning.

324
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,560
But I guess they'd put the Konami code in so that it wouldn't be that hard.

325
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, and then here's the thing, the fucking competition broke twice.

326
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,680
Like they started, the whole thing started with Mario brothers and the second player

327
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,040
side like wouldn't answer.

328
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,820
So they said they had to restart and then they got all the way to Contra and the thing

329
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,040
froze or something and they had to restart the entire competition.

330
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,780
And you know what really sucks?

331
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:24,000
The team that was ahead the first time lost, wah, wah, wah.

332
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So yeah.

333
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,180
And then they were like, thanks for coming to watch the megathon, PAX East was awesome.

334
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,560
It was more awesome than PAX prime.

335
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,000
See you next year, bitches.

336
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
And that was it.

337
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,600
And I'm sitting like, I stood in an hour and like 30 minute line for that, which I could

338
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,680
have read about on the internet in five minutes.

339
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
That's stinky.

340
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
It was very unfortunate.

341
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,380
I hear past omega-thons have been much better.

342
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,240
That was a very unfortunate low light of PAX.

343
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,840
So there you go.

344
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,640
Anyhow, that was part of my gaming week was PAX.

345
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,200
Otherwise actual games I've been playing during the week, uh, game room, I've been playing

346
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
quite a bit of.

347
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,680
Bobby and I have been having a little spar in Yars revenge.

348
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,520
It's like an unsaid competition, but I swear I've played Yars revenge more than any other

349
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,760
game this week.

350
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Game room.

351
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,240
There's a lot I really like about it.

352
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,040
I really, really like that when you do challenges, it saves replays of your friends and that

353
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,920
you can issue challenges and have leaderboards and have these stupid little animations that

354
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,460
your characters do when you win challenges.

355
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,520
And I like that you have the medals that you earn and so forth.

356
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,320
And you know, that despite the fact that tokens don't really get you anything but bonus demo

357
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,040
plays, it's still kind of cool that there's that incentive.

358
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,680
But there's a lot that I don't like about game room too.

359
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,740
And one of them is that the servers never work, which is ridiculous when you're trying

360
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,440
to like get a high score saved or something.

361
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,080
You might have to be hitting the button over and over and sometimes I've, I've lost scores

362
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,240
because the servers literally go up and down and up and down and up and down.

363
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,760
Like it is just atrocious.

364
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,320
So I don't know what is going on with game room, but there's a good game room in there

365
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,020
somewhere.

366
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,640
It's just, you know, they've got a lot of kinks to work out.

367
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,760
Honestly, my, my gut tells me as much as I, there's a lot I do like about game room, they

368
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,320
shouldn't have released it when they did.

369
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,480
They should have waited until things were more stable.

370
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Maybe they had no idea how popular it was going to be.

371
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,280
I don't know, but I think they should have waited until like June.

372
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,320
By the way, pro tip, I find I do better when I play on games for Windows with an Xbox Live

373
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,320
controller or with an Xbox 360 controller than I do on regular Xbox.

374
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,880
And I think part of the reason is that you're sitting right there in front of the monitor,

375
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,000
just like an old school arcade cabinet.

376
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,400
You're not sitting several feet away from your TV.

377
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,640
And I think it does help the precision, especially on a lot of those old games, especially on

378
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,320
things like asteroid deluxe where your bullets are like tiny, tiny, it kind of helps to be

379
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,960
sitting right in front of the monitor as much as my mother would hate that.

380
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,280
So there you go.

381
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,040
Spyro in our chat room says game room is free.

382
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
That is true.

383
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
The game room engine itself is free and you can get like a good, like, I don't know, like

384
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,040
50 gamers score just for downloading it and putting up decorations in your room.

385
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,680
But you will have to pay at least like $3 to enjoy a game or $5 if you want them to

386
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,100
be multi-platform, which is how I've been buying all my games.

387
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,760
But I do go back and forth between Windows and 360.

388
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,760
And some people might say $5, Rob, you're crazy.

389
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,800
But well, I mean, I paid $5 for Frogger and Joust on the 360 when it first came out.

390
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,020
And I've honestly played Yars' Revenge more than any other game this week.

391
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,020
But I did play some other stuff.

392
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,720
On the plane, I played a Final Fantasy Tactics A2 on the DS.

393
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,080
I borrowed that game.

394
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
It's cool.

395
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
It's awesome.

396
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Like the way that was set up.

397
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,600
Didn't realize it was part of the Final Fantasy XII canon, but that was kind of nice to play

398
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
that.

399
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,840
Had a little bit of fun with that.

400
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,480
And honestly, that's, besides Warcraft and some of the other just little things here

401
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
and there, that's really about it for my gaming week.

402
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,840
DarkSakra, oh she who keeps blowing her nose and sinuses over there, how is your gaming

403
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
week going?

404
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,000
I just played some Star Trek Online.

405
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,960
I've been taking advantage of my spring break to not be at my computer or not be in front

406
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
of a TV.

407
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:03,840
I just tried to rest a lot, you know, because I've been so busy with everything and then

408
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:10,000
I was gonna actually make a good start on Final Fantasy II today.

409
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,160
And then the allergy monster smacked me in the face, so basically every time I haven't

410
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,660
been working on something here, I've been asleep.

411
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,400
So I've been playing Dream.

412
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,080
I've been playing Benadryl the game.

413
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,120
It's where you take Benadryl and see if it'll either make you high or pass out.

414
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,160
In my case it was pass out and that's what's happening again because I took another Benadryl.

415
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,240
Great, so you took drugs that are gonna make you drowsy during the show.

416
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,880
I took drugs so that I could breathe and then Dan gave me a Vix inhaler thing and I love

417
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
those things.

418
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,600
It's a tube you stick up your nose and snort.

419
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
It looks like a tampon applicator, honestly, from where I'm sitting.

420
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
It looks like a tampon.

421
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
It does.

422
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,640
It looks like you're shoving a tampon in your nose and pushing a button.

423
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
That's disgusting.

424
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Don't do that.

425
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
I just stuck it in my nose.

426
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Thank God it's radio.

427
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,160
This is where all of you in chat are very thankful.

428
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I have a camera, Rob.

429
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:04,640
All right, anyhow, where else was I with this, talking about webcams and all that stuff?

430
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,520
Oh, I did want to say this about Rocky last night as I went to Rocky and, well, A, Alan

431
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,080
was playing a crap ton of Peggle which I thought was cute because it made me think of you.

432
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,040
That's one time I thought of you last night and then the other time, are you gonna put

433
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,080
that on the OLR blog, I dare you.

434
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,180
Dark Soccer never likes pictures of herself to get up on the internet and I dare her to

435
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,680
put the tampon in her nose on the internet.

436
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,520
I have a reason to look like shit.

437
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
Are you putting that on the internet?

438
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Why not?

439
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Oh, I'm happy.

440
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
All right.

441
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,920
Dark Soccer with a tampon in her nose.

442
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,300
Yes, as Mae Satsuma in chat says, it's nosepon.

443
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,720
It's going up on the internet right now, orangehontrader.com.

444
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,620
Click refresh a million times.

445
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,980
I then also thought of you because I was playing the criminologist last night at Rocky and

446
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,000
I was going through the bag and there's two wigs in there, one gray and one black.

447
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,760
And when I pulled out the black wig, I went, this looks like a Tribble.

448
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,260
And I was like, oh, that makes me think of my friend Jamie because she plays Star Trek

449
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,080
online and she always tells the story about the Tribbles.

450
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,200
Did you know you can get the Tribbles in your inventory and they multiply?

451
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,280
They only multiply if you have food because they eat your food.

452
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Yes, that's right.

454
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,800
The picture should be up now.

455
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,360
If I see this on verydemotivational.com, I will kill you.

456
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,520
Don't tell them what website to post it to.

457
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
At least you're not John McCain.

458
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,800
Did you hear about that?

459
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,880
What the fuck happened this time?

460
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,280
I don't pay attention to that loser.

461
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,560
No, this is funny.

462
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,300
John McCain posted a picture of himself on the Twit pic or whatever, you know, and I'm

463
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,480
not starting a political thing.

464
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,640
I just think this is funny.

465
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,320
If it had been Obama, it would have been funny too.

466
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,880
Was he like playing with his nibbles or something?

467
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
No, no, no.

468
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
He was.

469
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
It was really funny.

470
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,280
No, he posted a picture just on his iPhone like, you know, because, you know, John McCain

471
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,760
is really old, right?

472
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,360
So the joke is he's probably not hip with technology, but he's showing, hey, I can take

473
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,420
a picture of myself with my iPhone.

474
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,080
So he did that and somebody took the picture and posted it to guyswithiphones.com, which

475
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,800
if you've never been to that site, most of you probably don't want to go because it's

476
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,640
kind of a gay porn website.

477
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,120
Most of the guys that take pictures on that site have their wangs hanging out and, you

478
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,160
know, they're balls and that's what the site is, okay?

479
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Don't ask me how I know.

480
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,480
I read about, I read about it on Priz Hilton, okay, shut up.

481
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,760
But somebody posted a picture, that picture of John McCain on that website.

482
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,360
So you go to guyswithiphone.com and it's like penis, penis, balls, balls, wang, wang, butt,

483
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,360
but John McCain.

484
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
It was funny.

485
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
All right.

486
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Anyhow.

487
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,120
Hey, how about some housekeeping and then maybe we will actually talk about some video

488
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,200
games tonight.

489
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,000
It's going to be a short show tonight, kids, apologies, but if you can't tell why, I don't

490
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,260
know what show you're listening to, but it will be a bit of a short show tonight, meaning

491
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,180
it's not part A, part B, it's just one giant part tonight.

492
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,440
So we're going to try and wrap up the show by eight o'clock.

493
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
We will still take your calls.

494
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,280
We'll take your Twitter topics, mailbag, all that stuff.

495
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
We're not going to neglect it.

496
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Just a few less stories tonight so we can get out of here.

497
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,400
I'm reading one email.

498
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
There's one email.

499
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm going to read one.

500
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
One email.

501
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,480
Tiger call on our chat room says, what's next?

502
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,760
McCain gets on chat roulette.

503
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,160
Oh God.

504
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,880
Talk about the cesspool of the internet.

505
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Chat roulette.

506
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,520
I thought that was 2chan or 4chan.

507
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,120
There is no word to describe that, but like chat roulette, there's some really funny YouTube's

508
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:36,520
that come of chat roulette and my favorite is the guy that plays piano improv to the

509
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,660
people on chat roulette.

510
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
You've got to look this up.

511
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,660
What's his name?

512
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
Murk.

513
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Murk hot.

514
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,660
Murk hot is his name.

515
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Something like that.

516
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,320
I'm sure somebody in chat will say it, but, um, he goes on chat roulette and just starts

517
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,120
playing like random piano songs.

518
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,320
Like, Hey bro, in the red shirt, sitting there looking mean, you know, he just, it's funny.

519
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
Trust me.

520
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
It's piano improv.

521
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
It's hilarious.

522
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,780
Everybody thought he was Ben Folds, which made Ben Folds actually do it at a concert

523
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
later on.

524
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,280
It was funny.

525
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,240
Hey, gaming news.

526
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,920
We're a video game podcast.

527
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:16,760
Major Nelson starts off our game thing tonight and somebody hacked, hacked sword major Nelson's

528
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,060
game card.

529
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,060
You know, major Nelson.

530
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
He's famous.

531
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,000
And you know, if you ever on the three 60 and you download the X-Box minute, hi, I'm

532
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
major Nelson.

533
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,120
I'm at PAX East.

534
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,180
You know, that's, and that's exactly what he sounds like to, he always goes out to the

535
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,820
different events and he's kind of like, he's, he's the mouth for X-Box three 60, but that's,

536
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,820
that's a good thing.

537
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,080
Major Nelson is kind of the mouth for the three 60 Reggie fees.

538
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,000
Amay is kind of the mouth, even though he's also the CEO, he's kind of the mouth for Nintendo.

539
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,600
You kind of associate, you know, your, we press conference with Reggie fees, Amay.

540
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,640
And then Sony, I don't know, Sony, Sony doesn't really have a mouth.

541
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,560
I mean, I guess there's that one girl who's on the, the, um, um, core, but I can't even

542
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
think of her name.

543
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,900
Like that tells you what a mouthpiece she is.

544
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,240
So major Nelson is kind of like the spokesman, if you will, for a three 60, but his, uh,

545
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,620
his, uh, gamer card was hacked and it happened around the time packs was going on.

546
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,140
So they picked a good time to do it, honestly.

547
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:19,300
But what's weird is that like, I don't understand why you would like hack somebody's thing because

548
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,440
they hacked his name to say, I'm a faggot, like ha ha funny.

549
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,320
Like you're in the third grade.

550
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:36,040
And then, uh, I don't know, they, they made the, the, the text say any account, $100 PayPal,

551
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,940
I guess, meaning that you could pay these people a hundred dollars and they'll hack

552
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:46,760
any account because you know, if they can get major Nelson, they can get your neighbor

553
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,600
or your college friend that you're mad at or whatever as well.

554
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,580
Well, somebody took a responsibility for it.

555
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,960
I'm not even going to say who it was cause they're, they're trash and I'm not going to

556
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,000
promote them here on the show, but somebody took responsibility for it and they even did

557
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,240
a YouTube video, blah, blah, blah.

558
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,680
So obviously Microsoft fix this, but this just begs the question, why, why would you

559
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,400
hack someone's gamer card?

560
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,200
What is to gain from that?

561
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
It's EP'ing Rob.

562
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Really?

563
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,480
I mean, at least like when you hack a wow account, like, you know, in my house.

564
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,360
It's a famous target.

565
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,880
So it's kind of like when the celebrity Twitters get hacked and like, you know, hi, I hacked

566
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,620
Britney Spears, you know, I have a huge vagina and things like, it's funny to tweet as Britney

567
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,800
Spears and say sick things.

568
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,560
I don't, I still don't understand.

569
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,720
Like there's no, I don't know.

570
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,520
It just seems odd.

571
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Like a gamer card.

572
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,680
Why don't you just hack major Nelson.com like then you could get people to go to your trash

573
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,840
website like automatically with a four.

574
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,100
Not that I'm saying you should do that cause you shouldn't, but I just, I don't understand

575
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,580
the purpose of hacking someone's gamer card to say, I'm a faggot nonetheless.

576
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,800
You know, like that's just stupid.

577
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
It is stupid.

578
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,120
I know what Rob, what you're doing right now talking about it.

579
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,400
That's exactly why they do it.

580
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,400
No, I know, which is why I didn't say the name of the site that took responsibility

581
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
for it.

582
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,640
But I just think it's just weird to me.

583
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,020
Like I think it does need to be talked about, like why would people hack gamer cards or

584
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,120
what's next?

585
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,780
This is so watch out.

586
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,480
Don't make people too mad because they might send these guys a hundred dollars and your

587
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,640
gamer card will be hacked next and everybody will think that, you know, you're a whatever

588
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,800
sixth grade word they want to put in there to describe you.

589
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
So be careful.

590
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,680
Maybe they need authenticators on Xbox live.

591
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,320
Is that's what's going to come next authenticators?

592
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
Who knows?

593
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
Who knows?

594
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,640
You know, um, you know, uh, Kristin got hacked on wow.

595
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,640
I had read about that.

596
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
A lot of people are getting hacked on.

597
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Wow.

598
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
It happened.

599
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,760
Like if you don't have an authenticator, you are going to get hacked.

600
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,880
It's just a matter of time.

601
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,040
Like do not think you are immune to this.

602
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,400
Like I got hacked on wow and I am not stupid with stuff I downloaded.

603
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,880
I don't click banners on things that, you know, aren't legit and all this other stuff.

604
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,920
Like I got hacked and I think I know what happened.

605
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,140
I think I logged in on my ex's computer and he was stupid.

606
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,000
So I think that's what happened.

607
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You know what, Rob?

608
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What?

609
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I can't get hacked.

610
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Why?

611
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
My account's disabled.

612
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Well, yeah, you can't get hacked.

613
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I ain't paying for that.

614
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But actually I've heard of them like re-enabling accounts and going back in.

615
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So you gotta be careful.

616
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,240
Well, you have an authenticator.

617
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
You're fine.

618
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Yeah.

619
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,520
But I think I had a friend who his account was dormant for like six months and they re-enabled

620
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:37,280
it and oh man, they do, they do this dirty, dirty stuff just to get in there and mine

621
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,640
millions of ore and sell it to people.

622
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
Here's the thing.

623
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,000
When you buy gold online, you are supporting this.

624
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
I blame you as much as I blame the hackers.

625
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,440
When you buy gold online, you support all these accounts getting hacked.

626
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Knock it off.

627
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,680
You know, if I remember right in Star Trek Online, we actually do have a report if ever

628
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,400
we see anything happening right away.

629
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,120
Like it's set up in the mail and set up on the heads up display, which I think is smart.

630
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,920
You need to have some, I don't remember Blizzard had anything like that, but I liked what Ion

631
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
used to do.

632
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,280
They used to have these very public executions in on the ion server.

633
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,680
They would have like public executions of spammers.

634
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
It was amazing.

635
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,000
I have to watch them.

636
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That's what we needed.

637
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Wow.

638
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
We need, this will be the nice thing.

639
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,880
OMG spoiler alert coming categories of spoiler, plug your ears if you don't want it.

640
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Okay.

641
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,440
When gross takes over the hoard, since he's like a nasty little man, he should just start

642
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,820
executing the spammers.

643
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
That's what I want to see.

644
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,240
He apparently he's going to be executing everyone else, so he needs to execute the spammers.

645
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Okay.

646
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,880
And spoiler safe to listen.

647
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,960
Well, how about other stuff, Rob?

648
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Okay.

649
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,760
I have to make, give a shout out to get games.

650
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,960
Their ads are really funny and stylistically very good as a designer.

651
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
I like it.

652
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
All right.

653
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,240
It says in Soviet Russia, games get you two sniffs up, but it looks like old, uh, political

654
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
posters.

655
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
Anyway.

656
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,560
Um, two K sports.

657
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,600
They like a move in Natal.

658
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:14,160
Um, their marketing dude, Jason Argent said, um, that there are, that the sports games

659
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:21,160
are a natural fit for motion control and was mentioning by name, uh, the two K, uh, major

660
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
league baseball series.

661
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,260
They didn't really give anything else up on that, but I think that they're pretty pleased

662
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,880
with it and go and keep it going.

663
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
So good for them.

664
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,800
I don't know Rob, what do you think?

665
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,360
I think I should be able to get that big orange bat that you recently dug up, apparently according

666
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,880
to your Facebook and with Natal, I should be able to use that bat as I play two K games.

667
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,280
You'd have to come over here to get it because I won't break anything at all doing that in

668
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
my house.

669
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,040
But the orange bat is awesome.

670
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,840
There's signatures on that thing that I ain't seen in ages.

671
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,060
Not that I think that they're, they're going to encourage people to use actual bats with

672
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,060
these games.

673
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,040
Like it'll just be used swinging your hand or something.

674
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,600
I don't know, we're having the motion with it like a pretend bat, but that would be really

675
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,320
funny is if you try to use a real bat and like that is just not smart for most houses

676
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,080
because then the bat goes flying through the TV.

677
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,580
I mean, you thought the we emotes were bad, but this seems like a natural progression.

678
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:26,240
I mean, what, what smarter than, you know, if extra, extra gaming or exercise gaming

679
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,120
is like the next big thing, what smarter thing to do than to incorporate that with established

680
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
franchises?

681
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,320
You need a light saber.

682
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,680
This brings a whole new level to rod caliber, Rob.

683
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:46,200
I think though, I hope that what these games do is make this support optional and I think

684
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
they will.

685
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,560
I think they know that there's still a hardcore audience, especially when you're talking about

686
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,920
2k and you know, who knows whatever EA Sports ends up doing.

687
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,020
I think they still know there's a very hardcore audience that does not want to stand there

688
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,880
and flail their arms everywhere to pretend, you know, what have you.

689
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,120
I kind of like what they do.

690
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
You know, it's weird.

691
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,080
We don't talk about sports games a lot on this show, but I kind of like what they do

692
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,560
with Madden is that on the Wii, they really make the Wii game kind of targeted as the

693
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,480
easy type game, if you will.

694
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,160
And then the 360 and the PS3 versions are for the hardcore.

695
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Although I don't know.

696
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
I don't think they should do separate versions.

697
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,640
It's just be one version with two different modes, but we'll see what they do.

698
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,400
You all right over there.

699
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,660
It's like death is on the show tonight.

700
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
This is amazing.

701
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,720
I don't even look like myself, Rob.

702
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:38,520
I can't believe you put that picture on the website.

703
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Why not?

704
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
I don't care anymore.

705
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
No, it's fine.

706
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
It's fine.

707
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Jamie's in don't give a shit mode.

708
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,320
Please go to orangelaundry.com quickly before dark soccer realizes what a, what a, what

709
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
she did.

710
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,760
No, it's really a horrid picture.

711
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,520
I don't think I've ever looked that bad in my life.

712
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,020
You know what we need?

713
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,840
We need like a blingy competition with that picture.

714
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,720
A blingy, haven't you ever, well, you don't use MySpace.

715
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,840
So blingy is the site that puts the glitter and the hearts and all that.

716
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,020
Just MySpace trash all over a picture.

717
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,720
So somebody needs to take your picture and blingy-fy it to make it pretty.

718
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,360
This is the most horrible picture of you ever.

719
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
What is wrong with this show tonight?

720
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,400
Well, no, I, I came, I came home and I washed my face and I'm like, fuck it.

721
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,400
I don't care how it looks tonight.

722
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,720
And cause it's just you, it's just little old me.

723
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
That's Rob.

724
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
It's just me.

725
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
I don't care.

726
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,800
I love these Vicks and Halor things though.

727
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
They're perfect.

728
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,360
I, I might have to get one.

729
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
I don't know.

730
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
We'll see.

731
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
Although I feel like I'm getting better.

732
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,000
It's just last week was bad.

733
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,880
I, I, you know, I teach for a living and I couldn't talk Wednesday and Thursday and that's

734
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,440
bad for a teacher.

735
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,480
Like that's, that's really bad.

736
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,440
Toegak, by the way, is, is a blingy-fying your picture right now.

737
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
I'm excited.

738
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,560
Please do not really, or I'll never put another picture of me online again.

739
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,840
Toegak, send it to me private message.

740
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Okay.

741
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
Don't, don't post it publicly.

742
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,960
All right.

743
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,720
Anyhow, at least you're not a dirty thief, right?

744
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,680
You can hack all these accounts and stuff, but at least you're not a dirty thief.

745
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,440
Well, apparently at PAX East, there was a theft out on the show floor and I'm not talking

746
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,260
about like somebody's purse getting stolen.

747
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,120
Apparently Atomic Games had this game that they were showing breach.

748
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,960
The code was actually stolen from the show floor.

749
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,880
Now this whole thing ended up being stopped.

750
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,360
Like, you know, the guy, I guess had a little USB dongle thing.

751
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,540
He was trying to copy the code.

752
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,720
Somebody spotted him.

753
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,080
He ran out into the large crowd, but they caught him somehow and they found the code

754
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,560
on his computer.

755
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,020
And the suspect apparently did admit that he was stealing the code.

756
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,840
So he's like, yeah, I'm stealing the code.

757
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,000
And when he got caught, he said, no big deal.

758
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,040
I really liked the game and I wanted to play it with my friends because that makes it okay.

759
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,160
He stole about 14 megs of the code before somebody caught him.

760
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,440
That's so messed up.

761
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,000
By the way, the alleged thief, Justin D. May.

762
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,360
Wilmington, Delaware is where he lives apparently and he's got a lovely little picture all over

763
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
the internet now.

764
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,000
His little mug shot hit all the gaming blogs.

765
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,200
Let's see, he said, I got online using the ethernet cable hanging outside their booth

766
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,660
because wifi wasn't working.

767
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,800
They stopped me, checked my computer and saw the Xbox neighborhood application.

768
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,040
Because that was on there, they accused me of stealing breach even though it's not on

769
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
my computer.

770
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,200
So that's what he's saying in his defense.

771
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,400
Apparently though, the atomic staff is counter responding to this saying, he said several

772
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,360
times he knew people and could give us bigger and more important people and he could name

773
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
names.

774
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,520
However, I have no idea if these people are on the show floor or just hackers at home.

775
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,720
I would hate to think he got someone's full code and their title is going to be compromised

776
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
due to this guy.

777
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
I just need to make it clear.

778
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,960
He didn't say anything specific.

779
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,400
Boy, oh boy.

780
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,320
Apparently this guy, oh my God, this guy apparently even spoke up at a panel earlier in the day

781
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,280
about Xbox live enforcement and the thief wanted to get his gamer tag un-banned.

782
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,240
Steven Toluus, I probably mispronounced that wrong, Toluus, I'm distracted by Jamie's nose

783
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
blowing.

784
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,480
Steven Toluus, the director of policy and enforcement for Xbox live actually asked the

785
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,280
guy what he did and the hacker said he played Forza 3 before release and he said, well you

786
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,840
shouldn't have done that.

787
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,880
Now if you buy games early from a retailer that breaks street date, that doesn't get

788
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,160
players banned, but illegal pre-release play does.

789
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,640
Good gosh, what a mess.

790
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:54,520
This is J100 Matt in our chatroom says, how stupid does this kid have to be to steal a

791
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,760
game that had an ex-Marina at the booth?

792
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,720
Don't steal shit, especially when there are 60,000 witnesses around.

793
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,440
Don't steal shit to begin with, but really don't steal shit when there's like that many

794
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,320
people around.

795
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,600
Sometimes the best thefts happen in plain sight.

796
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,240
This is dumb.

797
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,200
You're a dummy.

798
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,880
Well how about something else that's dumb?

799
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,720
Although I kind of get it, but I still think it's a little on the stupid side.

800
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:28,600
The 3.21 firmware update for PS3 removes the option to install other OS.

801
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,520
So no more Linux.

802
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,300
They're getting rid of that because of security concerns, they said.

803
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,320
So they're just going to start taking features away from our PlayStation.

804
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,540
They're just like, nope, you know what, you shouldn't have this feature anymore.

805
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,480
You know what?

806
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,380
Not smart of Sony to do.

807
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,380
You know why?

808
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,080
Because Sony is getting cocky with all this hacking scene thing.

809
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,380
And I just point to the PSP.

810
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,860
Every time Sony releases some patch, they say, it's unhackable, unwinnable, the hackers

811
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,680
will never succeed, they will never hack the PSP, it is unhackable.

812
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,720
Two days later, it's hacked.

813
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,560
Well, I just want to say, if people want something badly enough, they'll find a way to make it

814
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,920
happen.

815
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,720
And so sure enough, they're going to shut off this because apparently there's some exploit

816
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,400
now in the PS3 Linux, I'm surprised it took that long, but now they are taking it away

817
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,000
from, one bad apple ruins the barrel, they're taking it away from everybody and saying,

818
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,520
well this exploit is just undoable now.

819
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,120
We took away Linux.

820
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,480
So now you can't do this at all.

821
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,660
Well, there is a hacker named George Hotz, who was an iPhone hacker, who apparently did

822
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,040
crack the code on the PS3.

823
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,140
And then that's what might have started this whole thing.

824
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:51,460
But the point is, is that if people want the hack bad enough, there will be something that

825
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,960
will reverse engineer the PS3 back to the old patch.

826
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,160
I mean, they do it all the time with the PSP.

827
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
I don't know.

828
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,540
I think though, for the majority of people, for the common person, hardly anyone's going

829
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
to notice this happen.

830
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:09,240
I mean, come on, listeners, how many of you were really using this feature?

831
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,840
And maybe there's going to be a couple of you that are like, me, me, me, me.

832
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,800
Well, if that's you, then you're probably continuing to use your PS3 for its Linux features,

833
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,480
and therefore you're not going to want to take your PS3 on PlayStation Network and get

834
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,960
the update.

835
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,060
Because that's the only way you're going to be forced to update is when you try to play

836
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:30,120
a game online or if you try to buy a new game, you know, that eventually, you know, the firmware

837
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,560
will be on the disks for that later game, Uncharted 3 or whatever game comes later that

838
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,600
everybody has to have.

839
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,400
Well, apparently, what, it's pretty, pretty big.

840
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,160
I might just put this in the chat room, because the way this guy has done it, I actually could

841
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,720
see why Sony would make some changes.

842
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,360
Well, I'm sure, it's just a matter of time before he finds another, he'll find an exploit

843
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,200
in a game or something to reverse the firmware back to something old that's on the PSP all

844
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,460
the time.

845
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,400
I'm sure if Loki were here, he'd say he'd already done it.

846
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,880
I'm like, it's just, it's just, it's too bad that Sony felt the need to patch it out for

847
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,840
everyone because this was found when this isn't going to stop it.

848
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
That's my point.

849
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,700
This is not going to stop the hacking.

850
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,640
You know, it's going to make it more difficult, yeah, but it's not going to stop it.

851
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,020
Those that really want to do it are still going to do it.

852
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,040
So it's just kind of a bummer to those that were using Linux legitimately, but at the

853
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,920
same time, I just can't think of a whole lots of reasons.

854
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,440
I mean, yeah, the computer in there was kind of unique, but I think if you're, you harnessed

855
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,000
its power for whatever, you're not really playing games with it and therefore you won't

856
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
be affected anyway.

857
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,360
There's just going to be such a minority of users affected by this, but it still sucks

858
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,360
for them.

859
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,200
You should send those angry cards and letters to Sony.

860
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,600
What I love about the patch that they did, didn't add a damn thing.

861
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,640
It didn't add anything.

862
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,600
There was no silver lining to this patch.

863
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,640
It's just, yep, we're just taking this feature away later.

864
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,560
ToaGak says, actually, they're having issues downgrading the PSP from recent firmware as

865
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
well.

866
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
It got, it's getting harder.

867
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,520
It's not going to stop them.

868
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
Won't stop them.

869
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,560
Anyhow, moving on to other news regarding the Xbox and talking about game room.

870
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,840
Uh, you know, I've been playing game room a little bit here and there.

871
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,440
I like it overall.

872
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,200
I think, um, they probably should have waited about three more months to release it for

873
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,280
them to work out some of the bugs, but you know, whatever.

874
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,760
It's it's okay.

875
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,800
Um, it's, it's showing promise.

876
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Let's put it that way.

877
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,200
It's showing promise.

878
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,680
Um, well, game room, uh, launched and they have 30 games in the lineup right now.

879
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,360
Um, however, you know, you might've heard when that they wanted to have a thousand games

880
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,400
on the service at some point.

881
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,720
And in order to do that, they're going to have to have weekly releases.

882
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,000
Well, it came out this week that you're not going to see weekly releases until late April.

883
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,800
So that would mean like, you know, the last week of April, basically.

884
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,160
So, if you were hoping for more games, nope, not going to happen right away.

885
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,080
You know, I'm looking forward to like Pitfall and Kaboom and some of the other, uh, Activision

886
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,080
classics and who knows what other little arcade gems they might dig up.

887
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
Burger time, anyone?

888
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,000
Uh, but we're not going to start seeing those till late April.

889
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,920
Um, interesting tidbit by the way, cause I don't think this came up on our show.

890
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,800
I think I mentioned it on Bobby's show on the call, but I actually, um, was with a pal

891
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,140
Segg, my friend Segg was playing game room on the show floor at Microsoft's booth.

892
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,920
And what's really funny is that he actually got the blue screen of death on the game.

893
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,320
And honestly it seemed like he, all he did was set the controller down on top of the

894
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,520
computer and it just threw the whole damn thing off balance and it blew screen to death

895
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,960
right in front of everybody.

896
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,040
So we were playing game room on the show floor and before he managed to crash the thing,

897
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,660
um, I asked the guy, I said, so they're going to be doing like weekly releases with this.

898
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,920
I heard something like a thousand games, you know, keep in mind, I don't have a media badge

899
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
on.

900
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
I don't use media.

901
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
So I'm just, you know, the everyday gamer.

902
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:02,080
And the guy said to me, he said, well, well, I don't know if weekly releases is what they're

903
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,320
going to end up doing, but they want to look at doing regular releases, but I don't know

904
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,820
if it'll be weekly.

905
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,040
So they're already starting to backtrack a little bit.

906
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,760
Releases that eat their fiber.

907
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,000
It will not be regular.

908
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,120
No, it will be just sporadic and all over the place.

909
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,040
Like a McDonald's inspired release.

910
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,840
Well, how about other stuff?

911
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
Yes.

912
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
How about Miyamoto?

913
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,360
I think being a little foolish.

914
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:37,960
Um, it basically thinks that Nintendo has a responsibility to educate the larger audiences

915
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,120
about the benefits of gaming that he thinks that most people are afraid of gaming technology

916
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,040
that, you know, once they become accustomed to it, there's nothing to be afraid of.

917
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,760
Not afraid at all.

918
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,640
How about just people don't like games?

919
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,520
Some of them just don't like video games.

920
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,920
I think there's a little truth to that.

921
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,720
I mean, like my parents don't like video games.

922
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,840
Well, I don't know.

923
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,680
My dad doesn't care, but he doesn't really play them.

924
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,520
I think there are a lot of people that don't get games.

925
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:15,080
I mean, going back to PAX a little bit, part of the whole, you know, people were very moved

926
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,880
by Wil Wheaton's opening speech and all this stuff, which I get because it was a very rah

927
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,960
rah rah.

928
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,060
This is our culture.

929
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,060
This is our time.

930
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,200
This is your place.

931
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,520
Nobody's going to judge you here.

932
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,560
You can be a gamer here and nobody's going to care.

933
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Okay.

934
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,960
Well, that says to me that even we as gamers recognize that not everybody gets gaming.

935
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
You know what I mean?

936
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
And yeah, don't get me wrong.

937
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
I think it's ridiculous.

938
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,460
I mean, games are no different than movies in my opinion.

939
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,020
I mean, you know, interactive entertainment, it's interactive entertainment.

940
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,740
There's you know, Nookie is interactive entertainment.

941
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,520
So it just depends on what you like.

942
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,920
I mean, I don't get people that hate on games, but I think we recognize there are people

943
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,760
that just don't get it for whatever reason.

944
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,600
Well, I don't, there's a lot of stuff I don't get.

945
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,440
Like the hills.

946
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,580
I heard the hills got canceled finally.

947
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,680
It took like five years for this to happen.

948
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,400
I don't get the hills like Heidi and Spencer.

949
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Why are they famous?

950
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Why?

951
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,680
I don't get that.

952
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,480
And some people don't get why Final Fantasy 13 is awesome.

953
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,760
But there are people out there that just aren't going to get games.

954
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,840
I mean, wasn't that Nintendo's whole little thing was that they were going to try and

955
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,120
make games more accessible to everybody and they somewhat, I don't know.

956
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,560
I think they somewhat succeeded.

957
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:35,760
I mean, they sold tons of consoles and people are all about, you know, Wii Fit and Wii Sports

958
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,160
and all these games that have seemed to cross over into the mainstream, you know.

959
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,120
Now there is a quote from him I want to read.

960
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,520
It has to do with Sony and Microsoft.

961
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,440
We feel it's an honor that some form of entertainment style we created is now going to be taken

962
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:57,040
for granted thanks to the attitude taken by other companies, meaning their adoption of

963
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
motion control.

964
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040
Aha.

965
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,360
So it's the kind of thing where it's like, well, everybody else seems to agree.

966
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,840
Imitation is the best form of, yeah.

967
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,880
Plus, you know, you're forgetting.

968
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,300
Microsoft does an incredibly good job of stealing people's ideas and making them better.

969
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,800
And I think that's what they're trying to do with this whole Natal thing.

970
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,400
They're going to make it better.

971
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
But we'll see.

972
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,640
I mean, that's still debatable.

973
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,120
You can't really argue that until the system or game or whatever you want to call it itself

974
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
comes out.

975
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
But we'll see.

976
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,520
PlayStation Move, you know, some of the early feedback was pretty good that it's way more

977
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,000
responsive than the Wii.

978
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,800
That's just competition, my friends, competition.

979
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,120
All these companies trying to one-up each other.

980
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,740
Speaking of which, there are a lot of companies out there that are currently trying to get

981
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,600
your dollar as far as selling their video games.

982
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,000
And we'll start with Japan this week for the release dates.

983
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,320
Some of the release dates.

984
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,240
Not a lot of new games on the 360 in Japan this week, but a crap ton of price reductions.

985
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,400
Death Smiles, Far Cry 2, Mass Effect, Ninja Blade, Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, Hawk,

986
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,060
all getting price reductions this week.

987
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,360
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, also just price reductions.

988
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
No new games.

989
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,160
Dead Blades and Tom Clancy's HAWK or Hux.

990
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,120
Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.

991
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,340
It's really kind of a dry week.

992
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,440
PlayStation 2, Clover no Kuni no Alice is like the only new game I'm seeing there on

993
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,960
the PlayStation 2.

994
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,480
On the Nintendo DS, again, nothing really new this week.

995
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,480
It's a slow week.

996
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,480
I don't know.

997
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,440
You'd think like there's a Dragon Warrior game or something coming out where everything's

998
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,840
getting out of the way.

999
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,920
On the PSP, Monochrome is coming out this week.

1000
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,360
I believe that's the sequel to EchoChrome.

1001
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:48,600
And then there is one other game coming out, Judae no Atelier, Grimnant no Rekonjutsu,

1002
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:58,580
Torawear no Morito from Gust, which is, well, it looks like there's this like, let's see.

1003
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:03,080
It's like a time traveling game and cute little slime looking characters and little teddy

1004
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,360
bears and cute stuff and chicks with enormous breasts.

1005
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,760
So you're very like anime infused game.

1006
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,320
It's a PSP remake apparently of an older game.

1007
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,320
So there you go.

1008
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,600
Well, I've got a couple of UK releases if you're ready.

1009
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:25,520
Just two, Blue Toad Murder Files Episodes 4, 5, and 6, and Lead and Gold Gangs of the

1010
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,160
Wild West.

1011
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
That's it.

1012
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,920
This used to be a slow week all over the world.

1013
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,920
I wonder what that is.

1014
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,920
Maybe just because it's not, you know, a very busy time of year, although isn't it like

1015
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,920
spring break?

1016
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,920
Well, I guess this last week was spring break.

1017
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
Yeah, last week was spring break.

1018
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,920
I don't know.

1019
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,960
It's a slow week in the US as well, which you have to look forward to this week in the

1020
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
US.

1021
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,760
Commandos complete on the PC, a Borderlands add-on pack coming to the 360 and the PC,

1022
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,080
a game called Again on the DS.

1023
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,300
It's an action game from Koi Entertainment.

1024
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,120
And then my personal favorite here of the week that's coming out, Squishy Tank on the

1025
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,120
Nintendo DS.

1026
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,880
And I love the cover.

1027
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,500
Of course, it's from Natsume.

1028
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,760
I love the cover art.

1029
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,320
It's like a puzzle game.

1030
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,320
And if you look at the cover art, it looks like, like, imagine a slime from the Dragon

1031
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,760
Quest series and somebody is poking it.

1032
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,740
And so it has the angry face because it's being poked, yet it is a tank.

1033
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,160
So there it is.

1034
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,520
Squishy Tank for 20 bucks.

1035
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,520
Squishy.

1036
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,840
It's a puzzle game.

1037
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,960
Looks like match up colored blocks and make tanks squishy.

1038
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,960
It's squishy.

1039
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,960
Squishy.

1040
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,960
Oh, we're ready to get into, I guess, the mailbag.

1041
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,920
We're at that part of the show where we're going to dive into the mailbag and read some

1042
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,920
of your emails here.

1043
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,160
I'm reading three.

1044
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,640
And Dark Soccer will try her best to not sniff through them all.

1045
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,040
Thank you everyone for keeping them short.

1046
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,120
By the way, if you want to send us emails, please do.

1047
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,820
Next week hopefully we'll be better.

1048
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,720
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place you send emails and Dark Soccer reads them

1049
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,480
like she's going to do right now while I munch on this tortilla.

1050
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,480
Hey, O.L.R.

1051
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,760
Oh, do you haven't eaten yet?

1052
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,760
I've been talking.

1053
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,760
I can't eat and talk.

1054
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,760
We'll fucking eat already.

1055
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,760
All right, you talk.

1056
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760
We'll eat.

1057
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
Let me know how it is.

1058
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Read some emails.

1059
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,760
Hey, O.L.R.

1060
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,160
I was listening to your podcast at work and noticed Rob wonder why Final Fight and Magic

1061
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,040
Sword are getting packaged together.

1062
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,800
The reason is simply that the developers of the company who are doing the port love Magic

1063
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,800
Sword.

1064
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,120
The only way they would have been able to get it released is to bundle it with another

1065
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,120
game.

1066
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,440
So can you, so you can think they're completely selfish acts as the reason you're getting

1067
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Magic Sword.

1068
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,440
P. A.Z.H.P.

1069
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
P.S.

1070
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,920
When Rob asked Loki to be a lady.

1071
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,160
For some reason I had an image of Rob singing Loki be a lady to the tune of Luck be a Lady

1072
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,160
by Frank Sinatra.

1073
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,160
I did that.

1074
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,240
Loki be a lady tonight, Loki if you've been a lady to begin with, Loki be a lady.

1075
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,440
I really did that on the show.

1076
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,240
I told Loki to be a lady.

1077
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,040
Apparently I was drunk.

1078
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,040
Wink wink nudge nudge.

1079
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,800
Thanks for the email.

1080
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,920
There should be more random tangents and acts of love.

1081
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,240
I know there's guardian legend fans out there.

1082
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,120
Help me out.

1083
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
But thank you.

1084
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,960
I'm so excited about Magic Sword I could piddle.

1085
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,960
Okay.

1086
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,560
Next one.

1087
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,560
Good evening Orange Nails Radio and fellow listeners.

1088
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,880
This is Gditz writing in again.

1089
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,560
Seeing as it's my birthday today then that I am in the process of getting ready for a

1090
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,920
night out I realize I won't be able to attend the live show today which I regret as it is

1091
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,540
always something fun and enlightening.

1092
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:33,180
So I figured I'd write an email instead so that you guys, while I'm drinking myself into

1093
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,480
a coma, you guys and gal will have something to discuss about video games.

1094
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,640
Oh, cause, sorry Mendoza's stuffing up again.

1095
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,920
I remember myself when I was under the age of 18 and had no problem purchasing one of

1096
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,920
the worst slash best murder simulators of all time, Grand Theft Auto 3.

1097
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,120
I am not really shocked that I managed to pull it off but I am a bit dismayed that the

1098
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,520
retailers don't seem to care.

1099
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,120
So the question is, do you think it's too easy for children to acquire mature rated

1100
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,720
games or are the measures taken by retailers good enough?

1101
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,560
Sorry for any and all spelling errors and or grammatical mistakes and have a happy Easter

1102
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,560
everyone.

1103
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,180
Gditz the other Swede.

1104
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,560
Like I said before about hacking, if somebody wants something bad enough they'll find a

1105
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,560
way to make it happen.

1106
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,600
You know, there's always going to be loopholes.

1107
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:29,000
I just think that, yeah, there, there should be a degree of responsibility by, by, uh,

1108
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,080
by the stores to adhere to the rule.

1109
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:36,800
But ultimately if the kid gets the game that's on the parent, not on the store.

1110
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,360
I pretty much agree with Dark Soccer.

1111
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,600
I like totally like, you know, stores do the best they can.

1112
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:47,860
I think if stores are shown to not be following the rules, then actions should be taken accordingly.

1113
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,000
You know, they do the same thing with cigarettes and alcohol and all this stuff.

1114
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,160
But ultimately it's up to the parents.

1115
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,620
I mean, you don't know if somebody, somebody might have like an older brother who will

1116
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,400
go in and buy the game for them or, you know, like a friend who's older, a cousin, I don't

1117
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,400
know.

1118
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
That's kind of like the hookup.

1119
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,240
You know, there's nothing the stores can do about that.

1120
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,120
And if a kid wants an M rated game bad enough and finds that hookup, then they're going

1121
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,120
to do it.

1122
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,240
Unless the parents say, if I catch you playing that game, I'm going to fucking throw your

1123
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,280
Xbox in the trash.

1124
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,240
And that's something my parents would have said, you know, like that's what it's ultimately

1125
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,240
comes down to.

1126
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,680
I think my mom would have said, when'd you get this?

1127
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,360
No, my parents, my parents, I don't know, like, I don't know, mature rated games weren't

1128
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,640
such a problem back then because it was all like the 8-bit NES and the Super Nintendo.

1129
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,320
So my parents were kind of like, whatever, like they didn't really care about Mortal

1130
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,320
Combat and stuff.

1131
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,320
They thought it was stupid.

1132
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,540
Or my parents, I don't think they ever really watched me play in that stuff.

1133
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,280
And I think if they did, my mom would walk in and go, Rob, that is gross.

1134
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,400
What is that game that you're playing?

1135
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
That is gross.

1136
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,400
Rob.

1137
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,280
He just knocked the head off, Rob, what are you playing?

1138
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,280
That is gross.

1139
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,720
And that would be the extent of it, but I would have been 15 or 16 at the time.

1140
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,520
So it's like, you know, now I think I even use this as an excuse.

1141
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,120
It's no grosser than, you know, the movies that my mom watches, you know, Mortal Combat

1142
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,120
fatalities are funny.

1143
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:18,020
Um, last one, and he put a lot of information on here, but I'm not going to say it until

1144
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:24,440
I have this expressed permission to, Hey, OLR, just wanted to give you a quick update

1145
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,880
on the whole fiasco going on with game crazy.

1146
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,480
This is the guy who's the manager in Colorado, my store, along with four others in the Denver

1147
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,180
slash Pueblo area, the only two stores in Colorado remain, is now starting liquidation

1148
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,180
this Friday.

1149
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:44,120
Jamie, I really hope that Dan is still safe and if not, I guess we are all in this together.

1150
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:49,720
Wish me luck with everything that will be coming my and or our way.

1151
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,600
And to think I almost bought a 3DHG TV at Best Buy yesterday, but my little guardian

1152
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,840
angel was telling me not to.

1153
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,840
Now I know why.

1154
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,840
Frowny face.

1155
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,540
Please let me know what is going on in your neck of the woods.

1156
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,540
One good thing to pass on.

1157
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,640
A lot of my customers are now listening to your show and love it, so keep it up.

1158
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,120
Take care, dude.

1159
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,480
Well then I apologize to your customer base for tonight's show, but, um, I'm sorry to

1160
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,480
hear it, dude.

1161
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
Cool.

1162
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,040
Um, I, I, I hope it works out for the best.

1163
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,920
I mean, I hope you're able to find something somewhere else.

1164
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,720
I mean, those customers are going to have to go somewhere.

1165
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,960
So this is also dated from March 22nd, so we might've heard already.

1166
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,960
Dan dodged the bullet.

1167
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,960
Wow.

1168
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,960
Good for him.

1169
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,520
They closed down a bunch of other stores, but Dan's store was still a pretty well performing

1170
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,520
store.

1171
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,840
So he's like, we didn't get any inventory.

1172
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,240
We were running out and we were sad and we thought we were going to go and then we got

1173
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,120
a shipment.

1174
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,080
And then they said, yeah, so Dan's store is still around for a little bit.

1175
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,720
Dan is also awesome.

1176
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,640
And there's a thought that his might be one of the ones to survive chapter 11 if the company

1177
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,640
survives.

1178
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,880
He just said he was a little disappointed because he hates driving to Cameron Park.

1179
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,720
Oh yeah, it's far.

1180
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,400
I've never been there.

1181
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,440
It's it's it's snows and shit there, doesn't it?

1182
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,440
It's kind of far.

1183
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,080
So, um, manager dude, which I'm calling you until you say I can actually say it's you,

1184
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,640
I mean, you put a store number and everything, but I don't want to jump the gun.

1185
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,640
Yeah.

1186
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,640
Yeah.

1187
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,560
Um, I, I see right about the liquidation.

1188
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:29,880
Take your, I deployed it and I hope, oh my God, the show is so sorry.

1189
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,880
And I hope that that something works out well for you and thank you for, by the way, spreading

1190
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,760
us around like a disease.

1191
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,760
Like Rob.

1192
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,760
Appreciate it.

1193
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,760
Robin.

1194
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,760
You know what?

1195
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,640
Uh, it was the not on me.

1196
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:54,680
I suppose it was a, uh, Fana, may 2000 I think my first Fana, may when I did my Emmy cosplay.

1197
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:00,620
Apparently all, all the Bay area DDR players and everything were getting sick from an illness

1198
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,880
that was in theory started by a certain moderator at the time on DDR.

1199
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,880
Nice.

1200
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,520
So, and I thought, oh, I'm not going to get it.

1201
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,520
It's all over.

1202
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,520
I'm just gone.

1203
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,160
I came back home sick with double yikes.

1204
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,400
Sorry to hear it con con crap.

1205
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:24,840
Um, but no, and I did get your email on my personal email address and I've just been

1206
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,840
swamped.

1207
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,200
So by the way, I have heard that there are game stores out there and like little, um,

1208
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,640
computer places, little, but you know, like land centers and stuff that actually play

1209
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,120
this show at the center.

1210
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,120
And I think that's rad.

1211
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,480
Like, thank you guys so much.

1212
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,960
Like we really ought to tone down the swearing so that it would be okay for more places to

1213
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
play us.

1214
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
I said crap.

1215
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,960
I didn't say shit.

1216
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,360
Well, but we, oops, I bet we're a heck of a lot more interesting than those stupid tapes.

1217
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,120
They probably send them to play with all the like, you know, hi, I'm Jeff Keighley and

1218
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,760
let's see what games coming out next.

1219
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,200
You know, like that stuff probably gets really old to see on loop over and over again.

1220
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,080
I think, you know, podcasts are kind of fun, so we'll have to think about cleaning it up

1221
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,080
some day.

1222
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,080
We're verbal kitsch, Rob.

1223
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:13,800
We're verbal kitsch, but, um, but back to the subject at hand, dude, I feel really rotten

1224
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,800
for you.

1225
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:21,160
And, um, shoot, shoot me another email to my real email and I will respond to you.

1226
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:27,760
And I, if I'm just so sorry that you, that this crap is happening and I mean, a lot of

1227
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,820
it is their own fault for their marketing strategy, but I think that GameStop really

1228
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,000
started dominating the market.

1229
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,280
You might just want to send with your email though, some E-Perell as a salacious pop and

1230
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,120
chat says this episode needs to come with some Perell.

1231
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,560
Jamie's about to go flush her head in the toilet to get it to stop hurting.

1232
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,620
By the way, backing up to some earlier messages in chat room from when I was impersonating

1233
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,320
my mother, um, Amae Satsuma says Skye's parents were from Sesame Street.

1234
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,100
Yeah, apparently, uh, Tiger Claw said, uh, Rob was probably like, Hey mom, watch this.

1235
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,480
He does a fatality in the game and she just goes ballistic.

1236
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,240
Yeah, that's not too far from the truth.

1237
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,880
I would do stuff just to, just to, uh, ruffle her feathers like, Hey, look at this.

1238
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,640
Oh Rob, that is gross.

1239
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,640
Why do you do that?

1240
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,840
You suddenly reminded me of, go do your homework.

1241
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,120
You still, it's only reminded me of something that Becky's two year old did.

1242
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,120
What's that?

1243
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:27,560
He went up to, Julian went up to Becky and picked his nose and said, yummy.

1244
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,400
With the big grim on his face.

1245
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,200
Just I guess he actually, he, this two year old has mastered smart.

1246
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:46,080
Rob, he's a smart kid, but is like, and then he shook his head and goes, yucky, uh, SSJ

1247
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,080
100 Matt says, no, don't tone down the language there, but he's getting freaked out that we're

1248
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,080
suddenly going to go G rated.

1249
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,640
No, we're not going to tone down the language.

1250
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,000
It would be nice if I had the time or one of us had the time or somebody had the time

1251
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,160
that we could go through the episode and beep out obscenities and that way you could have

1252
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,960
like a G rated version, you know, safe for broadcast, but let's face it, we're all too

1253
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,960
lazy.

1254
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,840
It's not going to happen.

1255
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,520
I mean, Loki's on this program.

1256
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,000
I mean, there's just, it's not going to happen.

1257
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,520
Not going to happen.

1258
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,400
Hey, uh, by the way, if you want to send in some emails, you should do so mailbag at orange

1259
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,480
launch radio.com is the place to send them.

1260
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,360
Now's the part of the show where we show a little angst and anger and say, F you man,

1261
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:42,600
F you.

1262
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,200
I guess I'll start the F us tonight.

1263
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,200
Oh, do your back.

1264
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Oh, hi.

1265
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,200
Dark Sakura stars off tonight.

1266
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Thank you.

1267
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:58,480
Um, a few to my allergies and the Sacramento area for being rife with plant life.

1268
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,400
I hope it all burns except for me and my stuff and yours.

1269
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,700
I need to see your new house.

1270
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,700
It's quaint.

1271
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,120
Come over next.

1272
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,640
Oh no, you have other stuff next weekend.

1273
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,640
Come over soon.

1274
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,640
Let's have breakfast.

1275
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,640
It's fun.

1276
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,640
On Sunday.

1277
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,640
All right, we'll see.

1278
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:20,840
Um, F you to Paxi's plague by the only one that has it.

1279
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:28,400
I think I am F you Paxi's plague, but I would like to say non F you to these lovely triple

1280
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,720
chocolate M and M's the dark soccer just gave me the air purple and sparkly.

1281
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,720
I'm going to take pictures of them.

1282
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,880
It's the gayest food I think I've ever seen.

1283
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,880
Dude.

1284
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,880
That's what I said in the kitchen.

1285
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,880
Rob, I'm going to bring you some of the gayest food I've ever eaten.

1286
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:49,920
He's a very gay, uh, as a show 100 Matt in the chat, this is a good question and sure

1287
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,120
we'll let chatters derail the flow of the show tonight cause I don't care tonight.

1288
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,240
I mean this show is already fucked up as it is as a show 100 Matt says, serious question

1289
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,340
for you.

1290
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:03,880
What did your parents think of you guys playing DDR dance, dance revolution, the game that

1291
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,800
brought this show together, dark soccer.

1292
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,800
What did your parents think?

1293
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,800
I mean, well you would already, you weren't really living with your parents at that time.

1294
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,360
I was trying to explain it to my mom and she's like, what?

1295
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,840
That was pretty much it with my parents too.

1296
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,680
I mean, I obviously I'd moved out of the house by then I was living on my own.

1297
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,920
Um, I would've been like, God, what year did we all start playing DDR?

1298
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,820
I was two, it was 2000 for me.

1299
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:25,820
So I'd have been 21.

1300
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,400
You were just a young and 10 years ago I'd have been 21.

1301
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,400
So um, I was already out of the house by then.

1302
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,280
So my parents didn't really know, but they found out later on because when we started

1303
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,440
doing the tournaments and stuff, like remember we ended up on the news sometimes and then

1304
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,080
like, you know, our show ended up on the news and some of that stuff.

1305
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:46,640
And so my parents were kind of like, okay, well like I don't, I think they just don't

1306
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,640
get it.

1307
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,340
I think my mom just kind of giggles.

1308
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,780
Like I think she kind of points and laughs at me, but doesn't like outright do that cause

1309
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,780
I'm her kid.

1310
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:54,780
There's people who do that.

1311
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:59,440
You play that arrow game and my favorite thing is, so if you stomp that makes the arrows

1312
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,440
move.

1313
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,560
You know what?

1314
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,560
You know what?

1315
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,080
I'm just in that kind of mood tonight where I don't really care.

1316
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,080
Do it.

1317
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,040
Let's, um, let's give somebody a call.

1318
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,040
Let's find out.

1319
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,480
Cause I just, I need to know.

1320
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,480
Hold on.

1321
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,200
Let's, uh, I just have to know the answer to this question.

1322
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,200
This is a very good question.

1323
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,200
That's just you and her Matt's posing.

1324
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,200
Hello?

1325
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,840
Hi mom.

1326
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,840
It's Rob.

1327
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,840
Where are you?

1328
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,400
I'm on, oh, she hung up on me.

1329
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,200
My mother just hung up on me.

1330
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,360
Maybe she doesn't want to be on the radio.

1331
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,360
Let's try this again.

1332
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:46,080
Live radio, boys and girls.

1333
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,080
Is it working?

1334
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,080
Stupid Skype.

1335
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:55,580
Let's try this one more time and I'm going to give up.

1336
01:01:55,580 --> 01:02:00,520
We do tape live every Sunday night at all games radio www.allgames.com right after the

1337
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,780
Bobby Black Wolf show, six o'clock Pacific.

1338
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:05,780
Thank you.

1339
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,800
Uh, all games radio for letting us steal your bandwidth.

1340
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,200
Hey, Scott has a new show starting ApoDay TV.

1341
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Check that out.

1342
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
We can call mine.

1343
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,200
Hello?

1344
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,200
Hi, it's Rob.

1345
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,200
Are you there?

1346
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
I'm here.

1347
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,200
You keep hanging up on me.

1348
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,200
No, I didn't hang up on you.

1349
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,200
It's the internet.

1350
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,520
I'm on, we're on the radio.

1351
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,520
Is that okay?

1352
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,520
I guess.

1353
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,520
All right.

1354
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,520
Say hi.

1355
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,520
What?

1356
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,520
Say hi to the listeners, mommy.

1357
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,520
Hi, mommy.

1358
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,800
Hi, this is Jamie.

1359
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,160
I haven't seen you in a while, but hi.

1360
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,160
Okay.

1361
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,160
So here's the thing.

1362
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,560
Tonight we're having a bad show because Loki is out.

1363
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,800
Both Jamie and I are sick.

1364
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,160
Like I got sick when I was in Boston.

1365
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,160
Did I tell you this?

1366
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,160
I don't remember.

1367
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,160
I got really sick, so I've been sick.

1368
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,160
Don't worry.

1369
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,960
I've been going to work, but I'm sick.

1370
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,960
And so everybody at work is sick.

1371
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,960
Well hopefully not.

1372
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,640
And the person that goes around my office telling people to go home when they're sick

1373
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,840
because I don't want to get sick.

1374
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,120
I just tell people I already had swine flu once, you ain't going to get it now.

1375
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,120
Okay.

1376
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,120
Here's the deal.

1377
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:08,120
We were taking questions from chatters and I thought the chatters had a good question

1378
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:14,280
and the chatter wanted to know, what do you think about your son, that would be me, playing

1379
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,960
Dance Dance Revolution?

1380
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,800
Like did you, did you ever know about this Dance Dance Revolution game that I was playing?

1381
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,800
Uh huh.

1382
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,600
And what did you think of it?

1383
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,160
What did you think of it?

1384
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,040
I thought it was good exercise.

1385
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,040
It was.

1386
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,040
It was good exercise.

1387
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,040
I was probably never in my thinning, or I was never thinner than I was when I played

1388
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,040
that, huh?

1389
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,040
Except when you had pancreatitis.

1390
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,040
That's absolutely true.

1391
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,040
What, um.

1392
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,520
Am I supposed to not like it or something because I don't have.

1393
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,520
No, no.

1394
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,520
I'll get.

1395
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,520
Well, let me ask you this.

1396
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:49,840
Were there ever video games that I played growing up that you didn't like?

1397
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,280
That I didn't like?

1398
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,280
Yeah.

1399
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:58,160
Only the, I didn't, I wasn't particularly fond of the, uh, very violent games.

1400
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,040
And why, why, why didn't you like that?

1401
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:05,840
Did you think that I was gonna go out and do things and imitate what I saw in the games?

1402
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:12,880
Well, it's just, I just don't think it's particularly good for children to be playing those kind

1403
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,920
of games, war games and things like that.

1404
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,440
Did you ever like catch me playing a bad video game and you like grounded me?

1405
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,440
Cause I don't really remember.

1406
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,440
No.

1407
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,440
I just remember you.

1408
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,640
No, because you had pretty good taste.

1409
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,480
You didn't really like those violent games.

1410
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,480
Well now that's not true.

1411
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,920
See, I was really good at hiding it from you.

1412
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:31,920
Well maybe so.

1413
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,920
Maybe I just.

1414
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,920
Never tell your mother how sneaky and devious you were as a child.

1415
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
Oh, she knows.

1416
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,700
She knows all about that stuff now cause it's funny.

1417
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:43,480
My sister and I will get together and exchange stories with my mother sitting right there.

1418
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,600
Okay.

1419
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,960
But the other thing, the other thing, do you remember a game called Mortal Combat that

1420
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,520
I used to play?

1421
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,680
Yeah I didn't like that one.

1422
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,680
Yeah.

1423
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,680
Wasn't it gross?

1424
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,680
It was pretty gross.

1425
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,600
Cause I remember I was doing an impersonation earlier that you would come in the room and

1426
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,680
you would say, Rob, what is that game?

1427
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,120
That is a gross game.

1428
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,120
Turn off that game.

1429
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,120
It's gross.

1430
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,760
That, that, that you were a little older then too.

1431
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,760
You weren't real.

1432
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,200
I mean you were like 14 maybe.

1433
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,200
So it was okay.

1434
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,680
I was, I was, I was at the point where it was okay.

1435
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,680
You weren't real.

1436
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,000
So I'm, you know, I'm thinking, you know, five, six, seven, eight.

1437
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,240
I don't, I wouldn't think that would be appropriate for a child that age.

1438
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,240
Okay.

1439
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,320
Well I got one other question for you here.

1440
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:30,760
And um, that question would be, um, why don't you like video games?

1441
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,520
Cause you don't really play games.

1442
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:37,260
What is, but you watch movies and you watch Oprah and American Idol.

1443
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,840
So what, why don't you like games?

1444
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,160
It's a matter of taste I guess.

1445
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,480
And for one thing, I'm not that well coordinated.

1446
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,360
I'd probably fail at it, you know, because I think you've been doing it ever since you

1447
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,360
were a little kid.

1448
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:57,480
So you're pretty well coordinated as far as, you know, you using the joystick and stuff.

1449
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,480
I'm not.

1450
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,640
So I'd rather be entertained rather than trying to entertain myself like that.

1451
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,640
All right.

1452
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,160
You're not interested in getting a Wii?

1453
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:11,320
You don't want to do Wii bowling?

1454
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,360
No, not really.

1455
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
All right.

1456
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,360
All right.

1457
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,440
Well, do you give me a Wii?

1458
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,440
You're going to give me a Wii?

1459
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,520
You want, do you want a Wii?

1460
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,160
Is that what you want for Christmas?

1461
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,440
No, but you, you acted like you were trying to get me to say, Oh yeah, I'd love to have

1462
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,040
a Wii so you could get me one.

1463
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,040
You wouldn't use it.

1464
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,040
That's why I'm not going to get you one.

1465
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,040
You wouldn't use it.

1466
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,040
You're right.

1467
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,720
The first time I'd wear myself out and then I'd say never again.

1468
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,720
All right.

1469
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,720
Anything you want to say to the listeners of our fine radio program, uh, the, you know,

1470
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,720
five people?

1471
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:49,440
Ask them why they don't have something better to do.

1472
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,440
Thank you for your love and support.

1473
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,440
Mom.

1474
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,440
I really appreciate it.

1475
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,760
Oh, I, you know, I love and support you, so.

1476
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,760
All right.

1477
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,760
Bye mommy.

1478
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,760
I love you.

1479
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,040
Happy Easter to you too.

1480
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,040
All right.

1481
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,040
Bye.

1482
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,040
Bye.

1483
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,040
My turn.

1484
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,320
You want to call your mother?

1485
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,320
Is she up?

1486
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,320
It's not too late over there.

1487
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,320
What time is it?

1488
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,160
10, 15 on the east coast.

1489
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,360
My mom doesn't live on the east coast.

1490
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,360
She lives in central.

1491
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,360
Oh, central time.

1492
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,360
So nine 15.

1493
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,360
I don't care.

1494
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,360
Wake her up.

1495
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,360
All right.

1496
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,360
Here you go.

1497
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,360
Punch in the number one.

1498
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,360
Mobile.

1499
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,360
Okay.

1500
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:29,680
Let's see.

1501
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,200
It's Easter with the family here on orange lounge radio.

1502
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,420
Oh, it did not like that number.

1503
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,420
What did I know?

1504
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,080
Mom's phone number acts wonky sometimes.

1505
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,080
Can you show it to me one more time here?

1506
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,080
Yeah.

1507
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,080
Okay.

1508
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,080
Sick.

1509
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,080
The top one.

1510
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,080
Okay.

1511
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,800
Here we go.

1512
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,800
Here it goes.

1513
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,800
It's calling.

1514
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,800
Dark soccer.

1515
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,800
It's all you.

1516
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,800
Hey.

1517
01:07:53,800 --> 01:08:14,880
Come on mom.

1518
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,880
She went to bed.

1519
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,880
You're in trouble.

1520
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,360
She, she's not sleeping.

1521
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,360
She's out partying.

1522
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,360
Let's leave her voicemail.

1523
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,520
Hi, this is Kathy.

1524
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,520
I'm sorry.

1525
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,520
I can't take your call right now.

1526
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,520
Please leave me a message.

1527
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,520
She's adorable.

1528
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:37,040
At the tone, please record your message.

1529
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,480
When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options.

1530
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,760
Hi mommy.

1531
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,760
It's your spawn.

1532
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:50,720
Um, the female one, um, your voicemail is live on orange lounge radio.

1533
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,440
We were trying to call you because it was funny.

1534
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,680
Um, but you would have been an internet celebrity, but you missed your chance.

1535
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,680
Sorry mom.

1536
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,920
We were going to ask you about video games.

1537
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,920
That's wrong.

1538
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,240
Terrible influence they had on your child, but you know, I guess call back, call back

1539
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,520
this number.

1540
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,520
I don't think it'll work.

1541
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,200
It's it shows up as like one, two, three, four, five, text, text Jamie and we'll call

1542
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,200
you back.

1543
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,200
Love you mom.

1544
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,200
Bye.

1545
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,200
Bye mom's voicemail.

1546
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,200
All right.

1547
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:19,520
Well, now we've successfully derailed the show three times over.

1548
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,520
That was a lot of fun.

1549
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,560
Hey, and we had a canine visitor.

1550
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,080
I know, and I'm not a big fan of big dogs, so that kind of scared the hell out of me,

1551
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,080
but thank you.

1552
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,080
All right.

1553
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:32,400
All of a sudden I just turn around, there's a dog in my life.

1554
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,400
True story.

1555
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,240
I was, did you know I was bit by a dog when I was five years old and I've had issues with

1556
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,240
them ever since.

1557
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,240
That's what you said.

1558
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,240
I know.

1559
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,240
Just in case the listeners don't know.

1560
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,240
I do.

1561
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,240
I'm not a fan of big dogs.

1562
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:49,120
Just, you know, Hey, how about video games?

1563
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:58,280
I put up the picture, I think I put up the picture of the very gay M&M's.

1564
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,680
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars.

1565
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:04,120
This game is only what a couple of years old, but we have some new news on it and it has

1566
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:09,000
to do with the way it is selling and you might've heard not much, but apparently actually some

1567
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:15,160
sales figures coming from February of 2010 apparently, and this is cumulatively up to

1568
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:23,040
February of 2010 Chinatown Wars, the sales of that on the DS represents 50%, about 50%

1569
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,920
of the sales of all M rated DS titles.

1570
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:31,720
So meaning that when you take the other M rated titles, dementia, the ward, resident

1571
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:36,120
evil, deadly silence, touch the dead core, ultimate mortal combat, and all these games

1572
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:41,580
and you add them all up, it doesn't match what Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars has sold.

1573
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:45,540
And this is kind of interesting because Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, the sales overall

1574
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:49,740
have tended to be considered a disappointment.

1575
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:53,240
And they even came out and said, uh, you know, they, they were blaming it on piracy that

1576
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:56,640
the commercial performance of Chinatown Wars has certainly suffered at the hands of piracy

1577
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,960
was a earlier quote, um, about that.

1578
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,480
I think it's interesting because it just goes to show M rated games are not selling on the

1579
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:09,180
DS, but at the same time, I kind of think, well, duh, most DS owners are kids.

1580
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:14,820
Like really like, true story, I was at Outback last night, the table next to us, what does

1581
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:18,880
the little kid have that's waiting for his little, little, little Joey, you know, what

1582
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
is it called?

1583
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,480
The young kangaroo menu, the Joey kid menu waiting for his little kid steak.

1584
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,120
He was playing a DS, probably Pokemon or something.

1585
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,440
The Pokemanses.

1586
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:34,760
I mean the DS is like most popular with kids like tweens, if you will.

1587
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,420
So of course the M rated games are not going to sell that well cause my mother would not

1588
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,720
have bought me that game when I was growing up.

1589
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,920
So there you go.

1590
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,100
Uh, I don't know.

1591
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,800
So maybe they just need to make some better games.

1592
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,000
But honestly, I just don't think the DS is the platform for an M rated game.

1593
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It's mostly kids.

1594
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
There you go.

1595
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Dark soccer.

1596
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
What's up next?

1597
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Some stuff.

1598
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,240
Um, Final Fantasy nine actually.

1599
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:06,560
Um, they are, um, they're planning on putting, um, Final Fantasy nine on PSN and then it

1600
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:12,400
was confirmed by Yoichi Wada, um, that, um, it would join Final Fantasy seven and eight

1601
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,760
on the PS3.

1602
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,760
So yay.

1603
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,760
All the VV you want.

1604
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,760
Well, why not?

1605
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:23,840
It's free money, honestly, for putting a nostalgic game that everybody knows and loves back on

1606
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:24,840
the PlayStation network.

1607
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,360
Although it was probably a Final Fantasy a lot of people skipped over.

1608
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,360
I don't think nine sold quite as well as the other ones.

1609
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,360
I didn't play that much of it.

1610
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,880
I actually, I played more of nine than I did of eight cause I actually liked nine.

1611
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,440
I actually got past the first disc on nine.

1612
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,520
I didn't beat it, but I went pretty far in it.

1613
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,520
It was good.

1614
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,400
It was a good game.

1615
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,080
It was, you know, that more traditional Final Fantasy as opposed to that, uh, cyberpunk

1616
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
kind of looking thing.

1617
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,760
And that was its big thing.

1618
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,160
So how about some Twitter topics?

1619
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,920
I don't even know if we got Twitter topics tonight, but we're going to go ahead and take

1620
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:00,120
some Twitter topics now on our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.

1621
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:06,120
Although I'm trying to load the Twitter right now.

1622
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:12,080
Hopefully I'll be able to filter out all the tweets about Justin Bieber, who is still a

1623
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,080
trending topic.

1624
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:17,240
And how much, how much is that swipe Twitter stupid?

1625
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,240
Don't worry about it.

1626
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,680
You're better off not knowing.

1627
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,440
Let's see.

1628
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:30,040
Oh, this story kind of hits close to home from a tiger clock.

1629
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:35,280
SEGA confirms closure of internal Iron Man and Golden Axe developer.

1630
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,680
Do you know where that SEGA office was located?

1631
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,680
San Francisco.

1632
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,680
Oh yeah.

1633
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,680
I've driven by there.

1634
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,680
Yeah.

1635
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,680
A lot of us have.

1636
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,680
It's right there off I 80.

1637
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,680
You can't miss it.

1638
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,680
Yeah.

1639
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,680
SEGA studio.

1640
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,680
San Francisco has been closed.

1641
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,680
They were making the Iron Man movie tie in games.

1642
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,680
Golden Axe beast rider.

1643
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:55,120
Um, unfortunately the rumors were going around and they closed it.

1644
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,320
That one hits very close to home.

1645
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,320
That's a bummer.

1646
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,760
I thought SEGA was having a resurgence in popularity with Bayonetta and, um, you know,

1647
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,280
some of the, they got that game, they showed residents of fate.

1648
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:09,240
Was that what it was called at PAX East actually looked pretty rad.

1649
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:13,640
I got to say so SEGA is having a Renaissance, but I guess the Iron Man movie tie in games

1650
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,960
are not exactly how to do it.

1651
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,120
They'd ever made it with good control.

1652
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,120
It might've been a different story.

1653
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:24,440
Uh, blue swim sends us some tweets saying, Hey, any thoughts on cave shooter death smiles

1654
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,560
getting a special edition with a nice Xbox 360 space plate and an OST CD.

1655
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,240
And then he links us to an article on Kotaku that actually shows us what it looks like.

1656
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:36,640
You know, there are some, definitely some shmup fans that are going to be really excited

1657
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,640
about this.

1658
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,640
And I think it's very cool.

1659
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,200
I mean, I don't know if it's something I would spend the extra money on, but I think it's

1660
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,200
cool.

1661
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,840
Like it's cool that the games kind of come into the U S at all.

1662
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,560
You know, like we just talked about how I think it was getting a limited edition in

1663
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:52,220
Japan, but I guess this whole, actually this giant collection is only like 50 bucks.

1664
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,220
That's not bad.

1665
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:56,960
And again, can't say I'm a huge fan of it, so I don't know if I could justify spending

1666
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:02,360
that kind of money, but I think it's cool that it's even coming out at all.

1667
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,360
So that's neat.

1668
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,760
Maybe a friend of mine will get it and I can check it out.

1669
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,760
I don't know.

1670
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,960
Uh, Alex P Carson says, O L R a your O L R logo is my Xbox gamer picture.

1671
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,960
Well, thank you.

1672
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,960
Did you know?

1673
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,640
And it's been a long time, but you can actually search for what's called community gamer picks

1674
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,640
on Xbox live.

1675
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,880
And we're in the pack too.

1676
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,640
It's like the all games radio pack.

1677
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,560
It has a bunch of icons for a bunch of all games radio shows.

1678
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,800
Uh, some of them aren't even on the air anymore cause it's been so long.

1679
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:35,800
Uh, but, uh, you know, we, there's an icon for O L R. There's an icon for Bobby.

1680
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,080
There's an icon for like video game outsiders and you know, there's a few shows that are

1681
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,080
still on that have icons.

1682
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,140
So check that out.

1683
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,140
Community gamer picks.

1684
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:46,680
They're hard to find, but you can probably find them on the website a little easier.

1685
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,680
Um, evil protagonist says, I don't have a topic.

1686
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,880
I just want to tell you all how much I look forward to listening each and every week.

1687
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:53,880
Thanks for all you do.

1688
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:54,880
All.

1689
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,880
Thank you.

1690
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,880
That's very nice.

1691
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,000
And I apologize for this week's show cause it's kind of shit.

1692
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,720
Blue swim also says, Rob, your mom's burn on the O L R listeners was Epic.

1693
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,720
Yeah.

1694
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,720
Well that's where I get it.

1695
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:09,480
Lastly, spazzinator or good buddy asks a WTF question.

1696
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:15,120
If major Nelson is the mouth of Microsoft, who is the asshole or appendix of Microsoft?

1697
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,680
Ooh, that's a good one.

1698
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,720
Who's the asshole of Microsoft?

1699
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,320
Um, my best guess, I mean, I don't think there's anybody who's just like a straight up jerk

1700
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,640
that I can think of, but definitely a lot of what comes out of Peter Molyneux's mouth

1701
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,700
is.

1702
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:35,640
So that would be my best guess for you.

1703
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,640
There it is.

1704
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,000
Rob, you know what I just got done typing?

1705
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
What's that?

1706
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
She'll cut a bitch.

1707
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
For what?

1708
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It's a Kathy Griffin album.

1709
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh.

1710
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Isn't that a book?

1711
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Or something?

1712
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I don't know.

1713
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,760
No, I think that it's one of our shows.

1714
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,760
Oh, okay.

1715
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,760
Couple more news stories for you guys and we have the classic game of the week.

1716
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,760
Yeehaw.

1717
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,720
Microsoft, speaking of which, well this is kind of an asshole thing to do, but not really.

1718
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,960
I get why they're doing it.

1719
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,560
They are suing Datel over the turbo fire controller.

1720
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,400
It's a wildfire is what it's called in the UK, which is where Datel is from.

1721
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,880
Unfortunately they say, you know what, this looks a little bit too much like an Xbox 360

1722
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:17,880
controller.

1723
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,840
And I got to say, yeah, it definitely kind of looks like an Xbox 360 controller.

1724
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:27,960
But I kind of always thought the third party controllers all resembled the original controller

1725
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,360
somewhat.

1726
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:36,120
But yeah, Microsoft is seeking monetary compensation and an injunction preventing the company from

1727
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,440
manufacturing any more of the devices.

1728
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,280
Now Datel and Microsoft, they've been going back and forth for a little while.

1729
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,120
I would guess that this was not a licensed Microsoft peripheral and that's part of the

1730
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,120
problem.

1731
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,400
Because you might remember Datel, they made the memory cards that got the shaft from Microsoft.

1732
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,640
So I think that's what this, this is just these two companies just kind of going back

1733
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,740
and forth at each other.

1734
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,960
It's a bummer because maybe the D-pad on this thing would have been better.

1735
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,560
And judging from the looks of it, it doesn't look so like a round D-pad, it might have

1736
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,640
actually been a little better.

1737
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,280
Kind of a bummer.

1738
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:12,080
But hey, you know what, Microsoft, you know, they did make that controller.

1739
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,080
And they patented it.

1740
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:18,240
And if you make something a little too close, that's why people get sued, especially when

1741
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,920
you're not already in the company's good favor.

1742
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,320
Oh well.

1743
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,520
Soon he's going to sue.

1744
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,520
Everybody loves to sue.

1745
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,680
All right, Dark Soccer.

1746
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:32,400
I wish I could sue my face.

1747
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,400
What a quote.

1748
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:41,720
So there's an MMO that's called PokeNet that was a fan run MMORPG based on Pokemon.

1749
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:51,360
And it was, actually Nintendo sent the request for them to shut it down at the end of March.

1750
01:18:51,360 --> 01:19:01,120
And they postponed closing it, but they actually formally shut it down on April Fool's Day.

1751
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,120
And that's no joke.

1752
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,920
There's just a number of them though that have been shut down, but this is just the

1753
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,920
newest one.

1754
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:14,400
And they said for the code that they created for the game, they're joking about using it

1755
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:19,240
for Digimon or Monster Ranger, but most of their devs are giving up.

1756
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,080
That would be a funny little F-you, I suppose.

1757
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,640
That's a bummer, but it's not a surprise.

1758
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,400
I mean, Pokemon is one of Nintendo's most treasured MMOs.

1759
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,480
You know, I see that these guys are just trying to make the game that everybody wants, which

1760
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,480
is the Pokemon MMO.

1761
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,240
I mean, that's what like tons and tons of gamers everywhere want.

1762
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,440
We've talked about it on this show.

1763
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:40,480
It could be a great thing for the franchise, and for whatever reason Nintendo is just refusing

1764
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,120
to do it.

1765
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,360
Probably because of the fact that it's a kid-based game and that would be very hard to keep safe

1766
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,040
and clean is probably part of the reason.

1767
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:54,040
But I mean, it's a bummer, but I think Nintendo's within their rights, certainly, you know,

1768
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,040
especially if it wasn't a quality product.

1769
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,040
They're absolutely in their rights.

1770
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:01,100
But I do think if the guys are that passionate about the product, they should go back and

1771
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,840
make it a different type of monster.

1772
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,720
I mean, that would take a lot of re-art and all that stuff.

1773
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:10,640
And plus, if it's too close to the Pokemon idea, it might still get the smackdown.

1774
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:14,920
But I mean, Pokemon and Digimon can co-exist, and you know, they're not that different.

1775
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,800
I mean, yes, there's differences, but they come down to little pocket monsters and collecting

1776
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:25,360
catch them all, catch them all, yada yada.

1777
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,800
But Nintendo's done that a lot lately.

1778
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:32,580
They shut down the Zelda project, the movie thing, remember that?

1779
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,040
But you know, I get it.

1780
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,440
They have a right.

1781
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:39,440
You can't just go around making all this fake stuff because somebody out there is going

1782
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,240
to think it's real, and then that's where the real problems start.

1783
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,920
Well, this was real, and this was licensed by Nintendo.

1784
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,080
And no matter what, Nintendo will never make this go away.

1785
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,560
The Super Mario Brothers Super Show!

1786
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:56,800
That's right, the one with, rest in peace, Captain Lou Albano, starred as Mario.

1787
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,120
And of course, you know, they would do all these cute little live-action skits.

1788
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,120
And then they had the cartoons.

1789
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,520
Well, if you want to relive this from your childhood, or if you never got to experience

1790
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,160
this as a child to begin with, guess what?

1791
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,960
It's on Netflix.

1792
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,280
So you can actually go check this out.

1793
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,320
I believe it is on Instant Netflix right now.

1794
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:17,880
So you can go stream volume one of the collection and check out what you missed as a kid.

1795
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,800
I actually have, either volume one or volume two, I have one of the collections on DVD,

1796
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,160
and it is so cheesy-cheeserific.

1797
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,700
It's amazing.

1798
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:31,160
Just to give you a clue how amazing, here's a blast from the past.

1799
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,160
Listen up.

1800
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,160
Hey, McDonald's!

1801
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,160
It's the Mario Brothers Super Show!

1802
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,160
We're with the Mario Brothers, and the plumbing's a game.

1803
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,160
We're not with the others who get all the pain.

1804
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,160
If you think it's no trouble, you can call us on the double.

1805
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:51,720
We're faster than the others, you'll be hooked on the brothers.

1806
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,680
You'll be hooked on the brothers.

1807
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:58,760
Do you ever watch this show growing up, Jamie?

1808
01:21:58,760 --> 01:21:59,760
Yes.

1809
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,960
Except I was really religious about watching Zelda on Friday.

1810
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,960
Me too.

1811
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,120
Well, excuse me, princess.

1812
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:12,640
I don't believe that is a part of this, because the Zelda collection's different.

1813
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:21,120
Zelda was on a different DVD, and I don't know if you can stream those yet.

1814
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,280
The chat room's bitching about the audio quality.

1815
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,280
Well, boo-hoo!

1816
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,280
Alright.

1817
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:32,480
Anyhow, it's that part of the show where we really like to take a look back at classic

1818
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,600
gaming's history, and pick one game to spotlight in a segment we call our Classic Game of the

1819
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,600
Week.

1820
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:43,000
Dark Sakura's gonna dig through the gaming vault, she's gonna dive in head first, and

1821
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,960
she's gonna sniff really loud, and whatever sticks to her nose first will be the game

1822
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,960
of the week.

1823
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,120
So, Dark Sakura, what did Nosepawn pick as the game of the week?

1824
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,920
Actually, it was Dan that picked the game, so you can blame him.

1825
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,920
I think it's a fabulous game you picked this week, so I thank Dan for this.

1826
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,000
Well, it's Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island.

1827
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Aw yeah, one of the best ones in the whole damn series.

1828
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Wah!

1829
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Wah!

1830
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Wah!

1831
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Wah!

1832
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Anyway.

1833
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:20,960
Basically, you go around as Yoshi, and you have baby Mario on your back, and you can

1834
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:27,400
play different Yoshi's, and, um, it's supposed to be a prequel for Super Mario World, though,

1835
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:32,640
technically, by the story, but I mean, your life bar is your baby Mario, and he falls

1836
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:36,680
off your back, you have to go, he floats around in a little bubble and you have to go catch

1837
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:41,600
him, and he gives the single most annoying cry ever.

1838
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,600
Wah!

1839
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
Wah!

1840
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Wah!

1841
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,600
Wah!

1842
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,880
Seriously, I think this game scared me away from children for a long time.

1843
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:56,000
Um, but I mean, you go through, there's also, uh, you eat certain enemies, give you certain

1844
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,760
colored eggs, you can throw them, you can eat certain enemies and shoot them just right

1845
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:09,120
back at themselves, and, um, this is a pretty fun little game, um, and also, if you get,

1846
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:14,720
um, a perfect score in all eight of the regular levels, you'll get a secret level, and there

1847
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:22,600
are five flowers that you can pick up, um, in, in each stage, and you have red coins,

1848
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:33,520
and all kinds of fun stuff that you can find, um, so basically you have to go and, uh, get

1849
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,280
Baby Luigi back from Magikoopa Comic!

1850
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:44,800
It also uses the Super FX2, um, for sprite scaling and polygon effects, and, um, all

1851
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,000
kinds of stuff.

1852
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:57,200
But, um, it was actually, um, the particular style for it, um, the rumor is that it came

1853
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:07,240
from an internal evaluation committee conflict with Nintendo, and, uh, Miyamoto was, uh,

1854
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:13,640
instructed to use the Donkey Kong Country style of pre-rendered graphics, and so he altered

1855
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,520
them to look as if they had been drawn with crayons.

1856
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,520
Interesting.

1857
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,760
I always thought this game kind of had a unique look to it.

1858
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,960
That's kind of cool that that's where it came from.

1859
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,960
Hmm.

1860
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,960
Yeah.

1861
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,960
Very cool.

1862
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:27,960
So that's it?

1863
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,480
Yeah, that actually was given the award for Best Game of 1995 by EGM.

1864
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,840
It is a great game.

1865
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:39,960
As far as sequels, though, we've had, um, Yoshi Touch and Go and Yoshi's Universal Graviton

1866
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:40,960
for the Game Boy Advance.

1867
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:41,960
Oh, I remember Touch and Go.

1868
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,840
And then Yoshi's Story came out on Nintendo 64.

1869
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:53,760
There was Yoshi's Island DS, and, um, Yoshi's Island, um, was used in, um, the SNES and

1870
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,560
Game Boy versions of Tetris Attack as a background.

1871
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,560
I don't...

1872
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,560
Is this on the Wii?

1873
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,560
I don't think it is.

1874
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,560
I don't think so.

1875
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,560
I could be wrong.

1876
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,560
I could be wrong.

1877
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,560
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1878
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,560
I don't think it is on the Wii.

1879
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,560
No.

1880
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,560
But that's, but that's it.

1881
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,560
It's Yoshi.

1882
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,080
This is also the game with Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy.

1883
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,760
And that was an amazing moment in gaming history.

1884
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:16,280
If you don't know what Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy is, I'm sure it's got to be on YouTube somewhere,

1885
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,280
right?

1886
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,280
Please tell me it's on you.

1887
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,280
Hold on.

1888
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,280
Maybe.

1889
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,280
Touch Fuzzy.

1890
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,280
There it is.

1891
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,280
I can't type today.

1892
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,280
I'm sick and there's earthquakes and I can't type.

1893
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,780
Okay, here we go.

1894
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:29,960
Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy.

1895
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,920
And this is the level that's hilarious because when you would touch these big fuzzy looking

1896
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,360
things, then your guy would just go psycho.

1897
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,360
It was amazing.

1898
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:40,360
And then he probably wouldn't do that.

1899
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,000
See, I think this is like a speed run.

1900
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
How about this one?

1901
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,400
Touch Fuzzy, Get Stoned.

1902
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,400
What is this?

1903
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,880
Fucking people.

1904
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,520
Apparently someone put in clips of Raiden DX.

1905
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,520
Apparently.

1906
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:02,800
Because that has everything to do with Super Mario Brothers.

1907
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,200
Comments from our chat room.

1908
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:07,200
Shao Ran says, that game, it kicked my ass.

1909
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,200
I'm not afraid to admit it.

1910
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,200
Tiger Claw said, never played this game, but it seems like Nintendo always retconned the

1911
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,200
Mario games.

1912
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,640
So Mario and Luigi knew about the Mushroom Kingdom since they were toddlers.

1913
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:18,280
Well, if they were that young, they wouldn't have remembered it.

1914
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:21,160
Salacious Pops says, I thought it had some kind of new chip in it that they debuted with

1915
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,160
the game.

1916
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,160
Yes, it was the FX2 chip, wasn't it?

1917
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,960
Yeah, it was the Super FX2.

1918
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:25,960
Yeah.

1919
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,240
It made it a bitch to emulate for a long time, I remember.

1920
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,440
That was one of the prized emulated games when it finally happened.

1921
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,520
Well, believe it or not, we are reaching the end of our show, and the part where we're

1922
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,680
going to open up the Skype line to your calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is

1923
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,260
Orange Lounge Radio.

1924
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,680
The phone lines are open.

1925
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,680
We're taking calls right now.

1926
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,840
It is a short show tonight, because as you can tell, we're a little bit sick and out

1927
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:47,840
of it tonight.

1928
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,960
So yeah, we're going to make it a short night here.

1929
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,000
So go ahead and give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge

1930
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Radio.

1931
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,280
This is the part of the show where I'd ask Loki for any last-minute stories, but I'm

1932
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,280
guessing Darsagra?

1933
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,280
Does she have any last-minute stories?

1934
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,700
I don't have anything.

1935
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,160
Her last-minute story is Benadryl.

1936
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,560
That is her last-minute stories.

1937
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,480
So we're just going to wait for the phone to ring here, because I don't have anything

1938
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,480
either.

1939
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,640
Damn it, call us, people!

1940
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:18,200
Next week, Loki should be back, and hopefully he won't be sick.

1941
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:22,200
We'll be fresh from my birthday beer pot look.

1942
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,200
Yes.

1943
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,200
Hopefully I'll be feeling better.

1944
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,080
I'm having a beer pot look for my birthday.

1945
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,880
It's going to be awesome.

1946
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,880
I'm coming.

1947
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,880
It's going to be fun.

1948
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:31,880
So soon?

1949
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:32,880
Shut up.

1950
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,440
You know something we ought to look into for the show, by the way?

1951
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:39,440
Last night at the show, at Rocky, somebody had this app on their iPhone 3GS that was

1952
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:44,480
a Ustream app, so you could actually stream video from your iPhone.

1953
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,640
So you might want to look into that for your phone, to see if we can do webcam again with

1954
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,640
your iPhone.

1955
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,440
And you could be the camera woman on the show.

1956
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,440
Maybe.

1957
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,520
It's going to be fun.

1958
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,960
We'll see.

1959
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,520
Is no one calling in?

1960
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,120
Nothing's happening?

1961
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:06,360
If you want to call in and share a story with us, you can.

1962
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,360
I don't mind.

1963
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,640
AlphaKananogram says I should leave a drunk voicemail from the beer pot look.

1964
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:17,800
I'll probably have to drive, so I don't think that'll be happening, because I'm a good boy.

1965
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,080
Some callers are saying that they get the voicemail when they call.

1966
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,360
Well, nothing is ringing through, so keep trying, folks.

1967
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:26,720
Hey, DarkTetsuya is probably calling in trying to talk about WonderCon.

1968
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,920
Did you know that happened this weekend, WonderCon?

1969
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,440
A big, big convention that happened in San Francisco over the weekend.

1970
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,360
Was a huge deal.

1971
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,960
I think it's like the second biggest comic book convention, only next to Comic-Con.

1972
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,160
And yeah, it was going on in San Francisco this weekend.

1973
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,160
Sadly, I couldn't go.

1974
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:50,040
I was in San Francisco, but I'm still so sick, and I was kind of conned out, which is all

1975
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,320
so bad.

1976
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,880
You know what, I'm gonna restart Skype, just in case something is going wrong with the

1977
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,880
Skypey thing.

1978
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,840
Let me just quit, quit, quit.

1979
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:04,960
I'm gonna quit, and I'm gonna reboot Skype, and we'll see if we get a call.

1980
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:11,640
Of course, I have to log in, because I don't ever save the password.

1981
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:15,760
And it is Easter, so it's a little bit slower of a night anyway, so we might not get a lot

1982
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:16,760
of calls.

1983
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:17,760
Bobby apparently had no calls on his show.

1984
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,240
I thought he had at least one.

1985
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,640
He had at least one.

1986
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,480
Somebody said they were trying to call, but they got a busy signal, so I thought, okay,

1987
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,280
let's restart Skype and see what happens.

1988
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,280
It's my mom.

1989
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,680
She did something.

1990
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,960
My mother, when she told all the listeners to go outside, basically.

1991
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,000
She grounded Skype.

1992
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
She did.

1993
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,640
She put Skype on time out.

1994
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,640
So let's see what happens.

1995
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:47,720
Skype line is open 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

1996
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,400
Give us a call.

1997
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,920
And BlackWolf said he did have one call, but it was an echo chamber, so it must have been

1998
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:58,280
something going on there.

1999
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:03,760
Any exciting plans for your week, DarkSakura, besides the beer potluck?

2000
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,760
Maybe...

2001
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,500
I don't know.

2002
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,200
Probably doing homework, really.

2003
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,120
Good times.

2004
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:15,880
Nonstop party for you, DarkSakura.

2005
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,840
What are you studying these days?

2006
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,160
What are you gonna be when you grow up?

2007
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:29,400
Hopefully a designer, which I'm already doing now, but I'm working on a website for my DreamMover

2008
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,400
class.

2009
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,400
Thank God, we're getting a call.

2010
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,680
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2011
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,680
Who's this?

2012
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,960
Yar had his revenge.

2013
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,600
Hi, Bobby.

2014
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,960
How are you?

2015
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,000
I'm doing good.

2016
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,200
Your Skype works, by the way.

2017
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,680
Yeah, that's good to know.

2018
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:43,680
Thanks, Bobby.

2019
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:48,200
No, I'm glad you called, because we're always on your show, so it's only fair that you come

2020
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,200
on to ours.

2021
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,560
That means you've actually been listening to this trainwreck of a show tonight.

2022
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:54,280
I'm so sorry.

2023
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,440
It's been fun.

2024
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,320
It's been very interesting, that's for sure.

2025
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:01,920
What kind of games have you been playing this week besides Yar's revenge, obviously?

2026
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,920
Astro Smash.

2027
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,400
And no, I've been playing Final Fantasy 13 as the real game, quote unquote, that I've

2028
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,400
been playing.

2029
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,880
How far are you into that game at this point?

2030
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:16,600
I am on Chapter 10, so if I was on the Xbox 360, I would have just put in Disc 3.

2031
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:21,840
Wow, you are way past me, because I think I'm on Chapter 9.

2032
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,320
That's the best place to farm Gil.

2033
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,000
That's the airship, right?

2034
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
No.

2035
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Actually, no.

2036
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I'm way back then.

2037
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,040
I'm like maybe Chapter 7.

2038
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,040
I'm in Palimporum, and I got to Hope's dad.

2039
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,760
I'm not trying to spoil too much.

2040
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:36,760
That's where I quit.

2041
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,760
I got Hope's dad in the little emo scene with that, and then I stopped right after that.

2042
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,760
That's where I'm at.

2043
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:47,000
That's the best place to farm money, because all those soldiers drop those credit chips

2044
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,080
and incentive chips, and those give 500 Gil and 2500 Gil each.

2045
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,620
I'm going to remember that.

2046
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:56,280
So when I'm on the airship, I should farm a crap ton of Gil.

2047
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,280
Yes.

2048
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,280
Pro tip.

2049
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,280
I like that.

2050
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,280
Good tip.

2051
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:05,440
Any games that you're looking forward to that are coming out in the near future, Bobby?

2052
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,840
Not really.

2053
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:07,840
Not in the near future.

2054
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,800
April is kind of a slow month all of a sudden.

2055
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,640
I guess things are going to pick up once the Crackdowns and the Red Dead Redemptions and

2056
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,040
all that start coming out.

2057
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,040
E3.

2058
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:18,560
Are you doing E3 this year?

2059
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,840
I'm hoping to go to E3.

2060
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:25,960
I did finally get my tax return, so I can finally start booking things, because I couldn't

2061
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,640
go to PAX East because I decided buying a house was more important.

2062
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,640
Well, yeah.

2063
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:30,640
Priorities.

2064
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,640
Priorities.

2065
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:36,320
But I'm still a renter, so I had that disposable income that you needed.

2066
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,760
But yeah, I'm definitely going to E3.

2067
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,040
I'm making it happen.

2068
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,280
Have you guys talked about the blur beta at all?

2069
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,560
A little bit.

2070
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,760
I have played it.

2071
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,800
What do you want to say about it?

2072
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,320
I still haven't figured out if it's...

2073
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,320
I call it...

2074
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,560
I say it's insane.

2075
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:55,040
I haven't figured out if it's insanely good or insanely bad yet.

2076
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,040
Why is that?

2077
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,560
What makes the game insane?

2078
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:01,640
Well, it's Mario Kart meets Need for Speed.

2079
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,640
Which is a great idea.

2080
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,440
That's basically what the game is.

2081
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:11,520
It depends on the map that you're playing, if it's fair or not, if you're not extremely

2082
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:16,980
good at it, or know all the sight lines and all that stuff.

2083
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:21,840
And what sucks is that I'm only good at one map, and that's the one map nobody chooses.

2084
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,460
But it is fun.

2085
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:27,160
It's actually a game I don't mind playing with random people, because I just don't listen

2086
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,760
to them.

2087
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:29,760
I don't either.

2088
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,600
I just don't turn on my headset when I'm playing that game.

2089
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,600
Do you think you'll pick up the full version when it comes out?

2090
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,820
I will at least rent it, because I want to see how the single player is.

2091
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:43,480
I'm still looking forward to Split Second.

2092
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:49,680
But what worries me about Split Second is that I don't want...

2093
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:54,600
Because I loved full auto, because the demo I played at E3 was amazing.

2094
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,600
It was awesome.

2095
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,600
It was great.

2096
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,600
Then I got the game, and I didn't like it all that much.

2097
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,960
I know Loki did, but he's not there.

2098
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,920
But I'm afraid Split Second made an amazing demo, and the rest of the game won't live

2099
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,920
up to it.

2100
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,400
And I'm really afraid of that.

2101
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:12,160
Well, you know what's interesting is that they were parading Split Second around PAX

2102
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:15,720
East, and it looks like they brought the same damn booth to PAX East that they had at E3,

2103
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,360
although it was configured differently for the space.

2104
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,360
I think it was the same demo, too.

2105
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,760
I can't say that with 100% certainty, because I don't remember that far back, but I think

2106
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,720
it was the same darn demo that we had at E3.

2107
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,440
So it's interesting that this game is still not out.

2108
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:32,760
At the airport or something, where the control tower's crashing around you and stuff.

2109
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:33,760
It seemed like it.

2110
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,480
I mean, I honestly didn't really play it again.

2111
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,320
I watched for a little bit, and it just seemed the same to me.

2112
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:42,280
It looked like I was looking at the same thing.

2113
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:46,920
But I don't pick out a lot of those little graphical things and things like that.

2114
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:52,320
I mean, imagine it has to be a newer version, but it was probably the same stages or something.

2115
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,320
Not really.

2116
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:56,800
I mean, because I guess looking from a game developer point of view, they're not gonna

2117
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:03,300
spend too much more resources just to show kids at PAX East.

2118
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:08,360
Because the PAX demo at PAX Prime was the same as the E3 demo.

2119
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:14,120
So it's very possible that they just, instead of spending the money making a new demo, they're

2120
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:16,320
trying to get the game out in time.

2121
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,440
Because I think it's supposed to come out before E3, so they're not gonna spend time

2122
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,720
making a new E3 demo, unless it gets pushed back again.

2123
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:29,440
But I can't see them for PAX East, unfortunately.

2124
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:33,120
I can't see them spending all that time making a new demo when they have a perfectly good

2125
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:36,880
one from E3 that is impressive.

2126
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:37,880
That's true.

2127
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:40,280
And probably a lot of people that were at that expo had never played it before, because

2128
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:44,040
it was a totally different crowd.

2129
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:48,120
Well Bobby, anything else on your mind before we try to go back and see if we get any other

2130
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,120
calls tonight?

2131
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:51,480
Or maybe it'll just be you, who knows?

2132
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:52,880
Yarr.

2133
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,000
I'm gonna work on that this week, Bobby.

2134
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,120
Like I told you on your show, I've never been better at Yarr's Revenge in my life until

2135
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:01,840
you inspired me to kick your butt.

2136
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,200
And you haven't kicked it yet.

2137
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,200
I'm trying.

2138
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,400
I've one-upped you a couple times.

2139
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,800
I've made you work.

2140
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,800
You have to admit that.

2141
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:08,800
I made you work.

2142
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:09,800
Yes, you did.

2143
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:10,800
Alright, there you go.

2144
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,800
There it is.

2145
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:12,800
And then you bow down and go home.

2146
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:13,800
Alright, shut up.

2147
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,800
Alright.

2148
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,800
Somebody else call in.

2149
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,800
Don't make it just me.

2150
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,800
Alright, have a good one, Bobby.

2151
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:18,800
See ya.

2152
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,000
Alright, so we know it works.

2153
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,720
Bobby got through, at least the Skypline works.

2154
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,720
We know that much.

2155
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:23,720
I know it calls out okay.

2156
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,280
We called my mommy earlier.

2157
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,920
877-K-M-O-L-R, username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio.

2158
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:32,200
I'm starting to feel like really headachy, so I don't know how much longer we can keep

2159
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,200
this show going.

2160
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:40,040
But we're gonna try to get at least one more call in on our Skypline.

2161
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,080
And then we're gonna wrap up the show.

2162
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:46,320
We will be back next week with an all-new edition of OrangeLawnsRadio, of course.

2163
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,680
Same bat time, same bat channel.

2164
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:52,440
I think I mentioned it a minute ago, but I should make sure to plug this, because after

2165
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:55,000
all we do steal the man's bandwidth every week.

2166
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Our old putty, putty, our old putty, putty, silly putty.

2167
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,240
Our old buddy, Scott Rubin, who hosts, he's kind of the grand poopa, if you will, of all

2168
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,240
games radio.

2169
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:09,840
He is starting his own little show, but it's actually a big show, at Appaday.tv, and he's

2170
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,380
reunited with Diane Miyazoda.

2171
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:12,960
It's like G4, back when they were cool.

2172
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:13,960
Hey, we're getting a call.

2173
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:14,960
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

2174
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:15,960
Who's this?

2175
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,800
Uh, this is Henderson Mann.

2176
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,040
Well, hi, Henderson Mann.

2177
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,040
How are you?

2178
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,760
Oh, I'm doing alright.

2179
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:24,760
Welcome to the show.

2180
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:27,160
Yeah, I've been a long time listener.

2181
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,040
I've probably listened for, like, the last two years.

2182
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:36,080
In fact, it was your show that introduced me to all games radio years ago, and now I

2183
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,520
have my own live show on Saturdays on all games.

2184
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,520
What is your show?

2185
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:47,440
Distributed Failure, where you come on at 3 p.m. Pacific time on Saturdays.

2186
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,120
I have heard of that program.

2187
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:50,120
Congratulations.

2188
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,440
That is awesome.

2189
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,600
So make sure Scott knows that.

2190
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,600
That's good.

2191
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,440
People have heard of us.

2192
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,440
That's awesome.

2193
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,120
Well, what is on your mind, my friend?

2194
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:02,040
What do we do with a phone call tonight?

2195
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:05,120
I just wanted to say, you know, you guys look like you're having trouble with Skype, and

2196
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:10,060
I just wanted to call in and say hey and tell you guys I'm a long time listener, and I did

2197
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:14,200
finish Final Fantasy XIII, which I thought was decent, but I still think it's low on

2198
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,620
the totem pole of Final Fantasy games.

2199
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:17,620
Not as low as VIII.

2200
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:21,400
I think VIII is the worst Final Fantasy game ever created.

2201
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:25,880
You and I can agree on at least one thing, that's for sure.

2202
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:30,200
I didn't care much for VII either, but I did love IX.

2203
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:34,880
I think IX is one of the best, at least it's the best one on the PS1 era.

2204
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:39,960
I would rather level a character from I through VII on Final Fantasy XI than play five more

2205
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:42,080
minutes of Final Fantasy VIII.

2206
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:45,560
I even bought the PSN version to try to go back and finish it, because it's like one

2207
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:49,800
of the only ones I've never finished, and I couldn't do it.

2208
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,880
I still couldn't get to my first disc.

2209
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:56,160
What made me mad originally when I played it is I got to a section of the game, and

2210
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:59,720
it's kind of spoiler-ish, but not really, because basically...

2211
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:04,120
There's only a six-month moratorium on spoilers, and it's passed, so spoil away.

2212
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,120
Okay.

2213
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:09,280
Your female character that's supposed to be your girlfriend in the game, I can't think

2214
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:12,800
of her name right now, but there's a section of the game where you go to a location because

2215
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:17,960
she gets taken, and when she gets taken, she's in this tower where all the enemies are level

2216
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:23,600
one, and you're supposed to have a special summons or whatever that can raise the levels

2217
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:24,600
so you can gain levels.

2218
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:29,200
Well, I got stuck at a boss there and couldn't get past the boss, because the boss was too

2219
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:33,880
tough, but I couldn't gain any levels because everything was level one.

2220
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:37,280
I tried to leave, and it wouldn't let you leave, so I got stuck in this endless loop,

2221
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,840
and I just eventually couldn't do anything, so I just quit playing the game.

2222
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,440
Stupid-ass system in that game.

2223
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,640
Just a dumb-ass system.

2224
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:46,620
I mean, the whole weapon system was ridiculous, where you had to go around finding these items

2225
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:50,520
to upgrade your weapons, so basically every battle in that game ended up being, oh, I'll

2226
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:55,360
just summon this monster that takes forever to watch all of its animation.

2227
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,360
Wonderful story, though.

2228
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,360
I will say this.

2229
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,900
Final Fantasy VIII had a great story.

2230
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:01,440
They should have just made it the movie, honestly.

2231
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,000
They should have just made it the movie.

2232
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Oh, well.

2233
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:10,640
I did have a great story, but yeah, that was the gameplay ruined that game so, so much,

2234
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:15,200
and I try to go back to it on PSP, and it actually looks decent on PSP, which is amazing

2235
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:18,560
because, you know, it is a PlayStation 1 game, but that smaller screen and everything being

2236
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:23,040
so compact, it does make the graphics stand out.

2237
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:28,100
Even Yars' Revenge looks awesome on my LCD monitor, like, you know, there's just a certain,

2238
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:31,840
there's just something to it that we didn't have back in, you know, the, back in the day

2239
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,840
of gaming.

2240
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,840
I attempted to play that game because I remember playing that game when I was like five and

2241
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,480
six years old, dude, and I just remember you go in that little middle section and the bullets

2242
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:47,680
wouldn't hurt you and all that, but man, it's, I picked up Adventure on there, but I haven't

2243
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:48,680
tried it yet.

2244
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:53,640
I just, I had to pick it up because, you know, it's Adventure, and then I also picked up

2245
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:56,560
Crystal Castle, which is kind of hard to control on that.

2246
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,920
Yeah, because, you know, that game needs a trackball, not a analog stick.

2247
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,280
I can't imagine that that.

2248
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:05,160
I haven't played that one yet, I'll be honest, I've kind of avoided it because I know it's

2249
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:10,840
can't control that well, but I just, I worry about the whole trackball versus analog stick.

2250
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:14,840
But Yars' Revenge, seriously, best five bucks I've spent on Xbox Live in the past, like,

2251
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:15,840
six months.

2252
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,880
I may have to pick that one up then, I've been looking for something, I think I also

2253
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:24,600
picked up Kicker or Shailen Road or whatever it's called, that's, that wasn't too bad.

2254
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:29,800
I really hope they bring out some better arcade games, I mean, I am disappointed they're waiting

2255
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,160
until after April or, like, the middle of April or end of April to bring anything else

2256
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:36,640
out, I think that's really killing the momentum of the people that really like Game Room.

2257
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:41,640
Well, it'll be here before you know it, and my hope is, is that there'll be, like, a couple

2258
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:46,440
huge games that come out, like, you know, BurgerTime, I'm just kidding, but, you know,

2259
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,440
something like really huge, or like-

2260
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:50,880
Oh, I would love some BurgerTime, dude, I would love BurgerTime.

2261
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,400
Like a 90s era game, or something to just, like, really, like, knock people off their

2262
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:58,040
feet for a minute, like, something like, I don't know, like, like, I don't know, like,

2263
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:00,720
NARC or something, well, no, I guess Midway Games are-

2264
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:01,720
Bad dudes!

2265
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:02,720
We need bad dudes!

2266
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,720
Okay, bad dudes.

2267
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:04,720
So, Bad Dudes comes out of Game Room.

2268
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,800
Are you a bad enough dude to eat a cheeseburger with the mayor?

2269
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,800
And then-

2270
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,800
The president.

2271
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:10,800
The president.

2272
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,480
Yeah, the mayor was Final Fight.

2273
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,480
That's okay, though.

2274
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:17,720
Uh, and then, yeah, and then, like, that'll get a lot of eyes back on Game Room, but hopefully

2275
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:21,040
they get all their stinkin' server problems figured out by that point.

2276
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:24,680
Hey, did you happen to see that that Data East collection that came out on Wii, or,

2277
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:28,280
I don't know if that's came out yet or not, it's got BurgerTime and Bad Dudes on there,

2278
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,280
so that's why I'm kinda hoping it'll come to Game Room.

2279
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:35,320
It does, and, um, some of the, uh, uh, uh, I believe, I haven't played it myself, but

2280
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:38,120
I believe it has, like, the sequel to BurgerTime as well.

2281
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:42,800
Ooh, I love me some BurgerTime, I've been tempted to try to find that.

2282
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,800
Yeah.

2283
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,840
So, uh, it seems like a pretty good deal, I haven't played it myself, but it'll be pretty

2284
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:48,840
cool.

2285
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:51,560
Oh yeah, Dartitsu's reminding me in chat, NARC is M-rated anyway, so it can't come to

2286
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,560
Game Room.

2287
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,560
Whatever.

2288
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,560
Technicality.

2289
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,160
Just turned the blood into sweat, that's, that's what they did back in my day.

2290
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:01,520
Alright, Henderson, man, we're gonna let you go to try and squeeze in one more call, but

2291
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:07,160
thanks so much for the call, and, uh, Distributed Failure, Distributed Fai-, I'm sick, Distributed

2292
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,160
Failure.

2293
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,160
Distributed Failure.

2294
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,800
Which I am failing to say the name of correctly, but, uh, it's a lot of fun.

2295
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,120
What did they talk about on Distributed Failure, is it a techie show, is it a game show, is

2296
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:17,120
it a-

2297
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,880
It's a game show, we talk about what we've been playing, we talk about video game news,

2298
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:23,880
kinda like this, um, kinda like all games radio in the past, we have live callers and

2299
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:29,040
stuff, well, nobody ever calls into our show, hardly, so, um, but, you know, it's, uh, you

2300
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,040
can find the-

2301
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,040
That's alright, it happens to all of us.

2302
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,040
Alright.

2303
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:35,240
Yeah, I said you can find the archives at distributedfailure.com, so, you know, if anybody

2304
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:39,600
wants to listen and check it out, it's there, and we're live on Saturdays, so.

2305
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,200
Best of luck with your show, sir.

2306
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,200
Alrighty.

2307
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,200
Thank you very much, guys.

2308
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:46,200
Tell the crew at Distributed Failure we all said hey.

2309
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,720
Alright, and bye, Jamie.

2310
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,720
Alright.

2311
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:50,720
Bye.

2312
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:51,720
Take care.

2313
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:55,560
Alright, sniffle, sniffle, let's try to get at least one more call in, I don't know, something

2314
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:59,240
seems to be borked with the phone, the actual phone people, I think, are having problems

2315
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:03,680
tonight, I don't know why, I saw- you all heard me call my mother.

2316
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:07,160
It seemed to be working fine, so, I don't know what's up.

2317
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,120
Your guess is as good as mine.

2318
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:12,800
We'll give it just a couple more minutes for a call to come in, and if it doesn't come

2319
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,980
in, then I'll just chalk up the phone's not working to, uh, just get another thing going

2320
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:19,080
wrong today, with, between the, uh, earthquakes-

2321
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,080
They have the plague.

2322
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,880
The rainstorm, and the plague.

2323
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:24,800
Do you think zombie Jesus did it?

2324
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:29,200
Apparently Rama's trying to call in, Dartitsuya's trying to call in, I think Spaznator on Twitter

2325
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:31,840
said he was gonna call in, something appears to be wrong with the phone line itself, I

2326
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:39,720
don't know what it is, like, watch, I bet if I call, like, I don't know, like, watch,

2327
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:50,000
I'm gonna call my cell, right now, and it's calling.

2328
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,880
And there, my phone's ringing, there it is, it's working.

2329
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:03,880
I don't know, the phone's, uh, stupid, it's the earthquakes, just blame it on the earthquakes.

2330
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:09,280
Alright, well, sorry guys, I don't know what to do, I guess we're just gonna have to close

2331
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:15,080
up shop for the night, and blame the earthquakes for taking down Skype tonight.

2332
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:18,600
You can't always leave voicemail, send us emails as well, mail back at orangesonshredder.com,

2333
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,840
I know Dartitsuya probably wanted to call in to talk about WonderCon, but he also did

2334
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:26,560
a fabulous write-up that's available on the site, orangesloungeradio.com, if you want

2335
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:31,600
to read that, he has a whole little wrap-up on WonderCon, hopefully we'll get some of

2336
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:37,100
these people in next week, I'm sure Rama wanted to call in to talk about Anime Boston, I know

2337
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:42,800
he was there, but sadly, Skype got earthquakes or something, I don't know what's going on.

2338
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:51,240
Shauran in chat says, blame it on the rain, I will, blame it on the rain, it is definitely

2339
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:54,560
time to put the nail in the coffin of this week's episode of Orange Laundrio, but hey,

2340
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,760
if you made it this far in the show, then you rock, thank you so much for tuning in

2341
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:02,960
to our show, and supporting independent podcasting, even at its lowest.

2342
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,600
If you liked our show tonight, all we ask, tell two people about our show, we swear it'll

2343
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:10,680
be better next week, when we're better again and Loki's back, although I don't know, something

2344
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,760
tells me there's some of our fans that probably thought tonight's episode is actually pretty

2345
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:14,760
cool.

2346
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:17,600
DarkSakura, thanks for being here and sticking it out through the show.

2347
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,600
I live here.

2348
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:21,800
I know, do you have a final thought tonight?

2349
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:24,120
My Ben and Jill's kind of working.

2350
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:29,280
My final thought is, Musinex is my friend, and I'm going to go take some more right now,

2351
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:33,000
have a great night everybody, we'll see you next week with another edition of Orange Laundrio

2352
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:39,640
that won't be so broken, and have a plan in case of an earthquake, just saying, just saying,

2353
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:42,080
and over this next week, have your earthquake plan prepared.

2354
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,080
Good night!

2355
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:47,080
