1
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:24,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, April 4th, 2010, a theft occurs at PAX East, Linux gets taken away on the PS3, and Nintendo puts the smackdown on the MMO fans were waiting for.

2
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:32,135
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

3
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:49,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

4
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:51,196
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get into that later.

5
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:52,777
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a good night.

6
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:54,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, we should just phone tonight's episode in.

7
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,020
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell are we doing?

8
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,503
[SPEAKER_08]: We should just throw the show roll in the toilet and just do whatever.

9
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:05,849
[SPEAKER_02]: If this is the first show you've ever listened to of Orange Lounge Radio, please go back in the iTunes archives and select another.

10
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just gonna be one of those nights tonight, I can already tell.

11
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:11,894
[SPEAKER_08]: We had the fuck show already, this is the fuck it show.

12
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:16,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Not here tonight, sometimes that's some of our best work though, so we'll see what happens.

13
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:19,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Not here tonight, Tagmaster Loki, sadly is not here.

14
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's got a holiday dinner thing going on, which is strange because the wife is Jewish, but whatever, there's a dinner.

15
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:26,785
[SPEAKER_08]: But it may be his family.

16
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:29,107
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know, I'm pretty sure it is his family.

17
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,729
[SPEAKER_02]: The man deserves a night off once in a while.

18
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:33,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if Nellie is observing Passover.

19
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:35,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

20
00:01:35,852 --> 00:01:38,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, she can't be because, yeah, never mind.

21
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:38,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyhow.

22
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:45,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I should say about Loki, you know, I'm sure he wanted to tell you all this on the show, but he posted it on Twitter.

23
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:48,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say, you post it on Twitter, CNN can report on it.

24
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:49,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore, it's fair game, right?

25
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Nellie is pregnant again.

26
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations to Loki.

27
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:56,364
[SPEAKER_08]: The pictures were kind of scary because I could see bones.

28
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,925
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what babies look like when they're growing inside of you.

29
00:01:58,965 --> 00:01:59,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see bones.

30
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:04,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And just so you guys know, not only is Nellie pregnant, she's, what, about 20 weeks?

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they waited, I mean, understandably, if you don't know what happened before.

32
00:02:08,873 --> 00:02:10,994
[SPEAKER_08]: They waited until it was a viable pregnancy.

33
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:13,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they wanted to wait this time to say anything.

34
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:15,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's about 20 weeks along at this point.

35
00:02:15,798 --> 00:02:16,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they already know it's a boy.

36
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:17,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one this time, not 20.

38
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:20,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw the pee-pee.

39
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:21,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what's that?

40
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:22,944
[SPEAKER_08]: They pointed to the pee-pee on the ultrasound.

41
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:23,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they?

42
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:24,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, yeah.

43
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:25,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Nellie would do that.

44
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:26,746
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very Nellie thing to do.

45
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,608
[SPEAKER_08]: They usually do that at the doctor's.

46
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:29,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at my kid's penis.

47
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:29,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

48
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:34,451
[SPEAKER_08]: The doctors will usually point stuff out on the ultrasound.

49
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:36,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make you some dinner.

50
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:39,393
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but in all seriousness, like a good woman should.

51
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Bite my ass.

52
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, if you want something more disgusting, bite my sinus cavity.

53
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:44,355
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

54
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:46,036
[SPEAKER_02]: So great.

55
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to monologue with the listeners for a little while.

56
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:48,917
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be fun.

57
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,117
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'll do my gaming week.

58
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear you from the other room, Rob.

59
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:52,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you can.

60
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:52,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll hear...

61
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:56,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk to the chatters tonight.

62
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:57,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk to the chatters.

63
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:58,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, chatters.

64
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:02,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, Loki is chat.orangelandrader.com, by the way, if you want to join our chat room.

65
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:08,829
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no Loki here tonight because he's having a nice family dinner, and obviously they have reasons to celebrate, so good for them.

66
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:10,430
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be back next week.

67
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, right now, it's just you and me, folks.

68
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:19,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You and the guys in the chat room, chat.orangelandrader.com, and we'll be opening up the Skype line a little later on.

69
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:23,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's the other part that's, I guess, just hilarious of what's going on right now.

70
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,500
[SPEAKER_02]: is that I am sick.

71
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,962
[SPEAKER_02]: You can probably tell my voice sounds a little bit out of it.

72
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura, you can hear her blowing her nose like in China.

73
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:34,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Go download Bobby's show from this week.

74
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:36,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like an earthquake going on back there.

75
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark, she's screaming at me from the kitchen.

76
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:45,213
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like the DarkSakura and Sky are married edition.

77
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:46,214
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on here?

78
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:47,735
[SPEAKER_02]: You're yelling at me from the kitchen.

79
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:49,436
[SPEAKER_02]: You're cooking me dinner.

80
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:03,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob is officially my gay husband Rob is my complimentary spouse Can I talk about fist bumping for a minute?

81
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:11,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, PAX East.

82
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't no one want to shake my hand at PAX East for whatever reason.

83
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,492
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple people, but I noticed the big thing to do is fist bumping.

84
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:21,532
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how people say hello now, is they fist bump.

85
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:26,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely that's a sign I'm getting old, is that I don't want to fist bump.

86
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in my day, we shake hands.

87
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:30,175
[SPEAKER_02]: But not when you're sick.

88
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:36,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, A, I wasn't sick during the con, and B, I already had swine flu in October, so I'm not going to have it again.

89
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:37,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I did too.

90
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:37,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.

91
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:41,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not cooking dinner.

92
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:42,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let everyone know what Rob is having.

93
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing I'm having.

94
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:50,545
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an Ezekiel 4-9 tortilla, so there's no gluten and no yeast in it.

95
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:52,767
[SPEAKER_08]: With some garlic hummus.

96
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:54,288
[SPEAKER_02]: All this healthy crap.

97
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:55,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Baby spinach.

98
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:56,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Fresh baby spinach.

99
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,070
[SPEAKER_02]: The wife's making me eat healthy tonight.

100
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And yogurt cheese.

101
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:02,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I will say more about this later.

102
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone knows I have digestion problems.

103
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:05,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I figured out what's causing it.

104
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's right.

105
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob in the chatroom says, I got it from the beanbag and shook your hand.

106
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:11,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

107
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,450
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was just some people were fist bumping.

108
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:15,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't... I met a...

109
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:24,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I met a blogger who blogs for a site that's commercial and they get paid for it.

110
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I told you the site, you'd all know what it is.

111
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And she wanted a fist bump.

112
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:32,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, okay, is that how we do it back east?

113
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:36,748
[SPEAKER_02]: But she was actually from California, so I didn't get it.

114
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:38,469
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess maybe it was a virus thing.

115
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:38,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

116
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,291
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just weird.

117
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:40,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

118
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:41,492
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

119
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:44,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't used to that whole fist bump thing.

120
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that's what bros did when they were drunk.

121
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:46,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

122
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,456
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

123
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:09,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft apparently is okay so I know if he's okay then it can't be too terrible so hopefully everybody is okay

124
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:44,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they build a lot of the structures down there I mean it's LA we're talking about so there's a lot of structural integrity down there so hopefully everybody's okay what I didn't know at the same time apparently nine minutes later an aftershock of some sort hits in NorCal

125
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:46,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

126
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have really felt it anyway.

127
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,812
[SPEAKER_02]: But the scary part is I was sitting on the Bay Bridge right when these earthquakes were happening.

128
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:13,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this because my sister, who is in Long Beach, texted me and said, earthquake, LOL.

129
00:07:14,074 --> 00:07:19,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank gosh I didn't like fall off the bridge if that earthquake had been too much stronger.

130
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:20,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

131
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:21,919
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

132
00:07:23,882 --> 00:07:24,342
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

133
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, apparently it's the earthquake show.

134
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the freaky crap show tonight.

135
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:50,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the hell's going on tonight.

136
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:51,764
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just like avoiding the topic of games.

137
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,185
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we can talk about games.

138
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:54,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into the show.

139
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:57,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start it off as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week.

140
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:02,510
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is still in the kitchen, but she's bringing, ooh, yay, vitamin water.

141
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:02,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

142
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when my throat is parched, I will be able to quench it.

143
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:08,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

144
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:09,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So my gaming week.

145
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:11,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we touch you, Rob?

146
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:36,777
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't that silly.

147
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:37,878
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we had a good time.

148
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:38,658
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a good discussion.

149
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,118
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

150
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:41,539
[SPEAKER_02]: You were a miss, DarkSakura, as was Loki.

151
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bummer you guys couldn't make it.

152
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Show itself, I don't know if I really actually ended up playing a lot of video games because I didn't want to wait in line for an hour.

153
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say what video games I did play.

154
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Classic Gaming Arcade.

155
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:57,543
[SPEAKER_02]: That big famous arcade they have out there in the East Coast.

156
00:08:57,643 --> 00:08:58,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun Spot.

157
00:08:58,903 --> 00:08:59,203
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

158
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:01,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun Spot brought some of their arcade machines.

159
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:02,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Two Packs East.

160
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:04,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So I played Donkey Kong 3.

161
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:05,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

162
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:06,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I played that.

163
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I took some pictures of pinball tables for DarkSakura on her Twitter.

164
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played the Buck Rogers arcade machine.

165
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually one of the sit-down cabinets.

166
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:14,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That machine kicked my ass.

167
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So I played some classic games.

168
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,142
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as...

169
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like jumping the sequel.

170
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:38,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like I like jumping with rockets.

171
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:41,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just people blast each other with rockets.

172
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I had a good time.

173
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get DarkSakura a present, but unfortunately I neglected to bring it tonight.

174
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:52,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But it involves a certain card game that people were playing everywhere, up and down the halls in the tabletop area.

175
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's one that DarkSakura is a fan of.

176
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:55,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Magic?

177
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:56,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not telling.

178
00:09:57,755 --> 00:09:58,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not telling.

179
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:00,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish.

180
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,106
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been fun.

181
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had a good time at PAX.

182
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:07,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for the Omegathon.

183
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about the Omegathon?

184
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:10,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that happened after the PAX show.

185
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:14,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already starting to get sick Sunday.

186
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:19,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friends that I traveled with, my dear friends Sag and Amanda, they wanted to wait in line for the Omegathon.

187
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:22,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I'm like, okay, I've never watched a final round Omegathon.

188
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm cool.

189
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay, let's do it.

190
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's sit in line.

191
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:26,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wait for the final round of the Omegathon.

192
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's watch the closing ceremony, see what happens.

193
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:32,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So final round of the Omegathon is supposed to start at 5 o'clock, right?

194
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:38,984
[SPEAKER_02]: 5.30, I noticed we're still sitting in line outside and we are cramped.

195
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We are herded like cattle.

196
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,166
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was a fire, we would have died.

197
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,286
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have all died.

198
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:46,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just we are in there like so tightly packed.

199
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:52,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently they posted to their Twitter, oh, we're having problems with the final Omegathon game, LOL.

200
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just sitting there thinking, open the goddamn theater and test behind the curtain.

201
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:57,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us in.

202
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:00,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm old and my bones can't take this standing around anymore.

203
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,074
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, like 5.45, they let us in.

204
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,981
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

205
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario Brothers, Rad Racer, Tetris, I'm watching the Nintendo World Championships about 20 years late

206
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, that sounds like almost the exact order of a Nintendo World Championship cartridge.

207
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:54,539
[SPEAKER_08]: It was.

208
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,300
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it was?

209
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,760
[SPEAKER_08]: For real?

210
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, for real.

211
00:11:57,663 --> 00:12:05,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have been some variation in the coin numbers and the lines, but essentially it was the frickin' Nintendo World Championships.

212
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:05,873
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

213
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:34,075
[SPEAKER_08]: To the, through the little tunnel part and through to the, like the very end.

214
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:37,778
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't the little dinky guy sitting in front of the gate at the first stage, was it?

215
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:39,079
[SPEAKER_02]: No, see, I took it to mean that.

216
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I took it to mean stage one.

217
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,262
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first boss is the end of stage one, right?

218
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:46,344
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it was all the way to the big orb thing that goes back and forth.

219
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:47,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really at the end of like stage two.

220
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:49,867
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how far they had to play.

221
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yippee skippee for that.

222
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:52,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Without cussing?

223
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:52,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

224
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Without cussing?

225
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:54,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Womp, womp, womp

226
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:24,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

227
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were like, thanks for coming to watch the Omegathon.

228
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: PAX East was awesome.

229
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,106
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more awesome than PAX Prime.

230
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:33,347
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next year, bitches.

231
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:33,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was it.

232
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:39,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sitting like, I stood in an hour in like 30 minute line for that.

233
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I could have read about on the internet in five minutes.

234
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very unfortunate.

235
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear past Omegathons have been much better.

236
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,936
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a very unfortunate low light of PAX.

237
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:51,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

238
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:54,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Room Game Room

239
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:12,095
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

240
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:43,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is ridiculous when you're trying to get a high score saved or something.

241
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:44,970
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have to be hitting the button over and over.

242
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lost scores because the servers literally go up and down and up and down and up and down.

243
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just atrocious.

244
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:54,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what is going on with Game Room.

245
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,257
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a good Game Room in there somewhere.

246
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:01,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they've got a lot of kinks to work out.

247
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:07,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, my gut tells me as much as there's a lot I do like about Game Room, they shouldn't have released it when they did.

248
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,264
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have waited until things were more stable.

249
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they had no idea how popular it was going to be.

250
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

251
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,909
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they should have waited until June.

252
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:21,635
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, pro tip, I find I do better when I play on games for Windows with an Xbox 360 controller than I do on regular Xbox.

253
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:44,218
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think part of the reason is that you're sitting right there in front of the monitor just like an old school arcade cabinet you're not sitting several feet away from your TV and I think it does help the precision especially on a lot of those old games especially on things like Asteroid Deluxe where your bullets are like tiny tiny it kind of helps to be sitting right in front of the monitor as much as my mother would hate that

254
00:15:44,918 --> 00:16:09,028
[SPEAKER_02]: so there you go Spyro in our chatroom says game room is free that is true the game room engine itself is free and you can get like a good like I don't know like 50 gamer score just for downloading it and putting up decorations in your room but you will have to pay at least like $3 to enjoy a game or $5 if you want them to be multi-platform which is how I've been buying all my games but I do go back and forth between Windows and 360 and some people might say $5 Rob you're crazy

255
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:17,951
[SPEAKER_02]: But, well, I mean, I paid $5 for Frogger and Joust on the 360 when it first came out, and I've honestly played Yars' Revenge more than any other game this week.

256
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:19,932
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did play some other stuff.

257
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:22,613
[SPEAKER_02]: On the plane, I played Final Fantasy Tactics A2 on the DS.

258
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:23,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I borrowed that game.

259
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:24,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

260
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:25,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

261
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:29,275
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Oshi who keeps blowing her nose and sinuses over there How is your gaming week going?

262
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:49,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I just played some Star Trek Online.

263
00:16:50,337 --> 00:16:55,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been taking advantage of my spring break to not be at my computer or not be in front of a TV.

264
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:02,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I just tried to rest a lot, you know, because I've been so busy with everything.

265
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:08,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I was going to actually make a good start on Final Fantasy II today.

266
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,890
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the allergy monster smacked me in the face.

267
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,132
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically every time I haven't been working on something here, I've been asleep.

268
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:16,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been playing Dream.

269
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Ben and Joel the game.

270
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,991
[SPEAKER_08]: It's where you take Benadryl and see if it'll either make you high or pass out.

271
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:30,054
[SPEAKER_08]: In my case, it was pass out, and that's what's happening again because I took another Benadryl.

272
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:30,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

273
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:33,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So you took drugs that are going to make you drowsy during the show.

274
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:39,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I took drugs so that I could breathe, and then Dan gave me a Vicks inhaler thing, and I love those things.

275
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,621
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a tube you stick up your nose and snort.

276
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:44,183
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a tampon applicator, honestly, from where I'm sitting.

277
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:45,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a tampon.

278
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:45,644
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

279
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:48,446
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you're shoving a tampon in your nose and pushing a button.

280
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:49,567
[SPEAKER_02]: That's disgusting.

281
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:50,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.

282
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:51,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God it's radio.

283
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:54,097
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where all of you in chat are very thankful.

284
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:55,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a camera, Rob.

285
00:17:58,314 --> 00:18:02,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow, where else was I with this?

286
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:20,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about webcams and all that stuff Oh, I did want to say this about Rocky last night As I went to Rocky And, well, A, Alan was playing a crap ton of Peggle Which I thought was cute Because it made me think of you That's one time I thought of you last night And then the other time Are you going to put that on the OLR blog?

287
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:20,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I dare you

288
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:27,937
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura never likes pictures of herself to get up on the internet, and I dare her to put the tampon in her nose on the internet.

289
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:29,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a reason to look like shit.

290
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you putting that on the internet?

291
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:32,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

292
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:33,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm happy.

293
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:33,943
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

294
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:35,725
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura with a tampon in her nose.

295
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:38,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, as MaceSatsuma in chat says, it's nose pond.

296
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going up on the internet right now.

297
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,352
[SPEAKER_02]: OrangeHandsRadio.com.

298
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:43,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Click refresh a million times.

299
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:44,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

300
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:46,536
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

301
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Only multiply if you have food because they eat your food.

302
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:10,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

303
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:11,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.

304
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:13,629
[SPEAKER_02]: The picture should be up now.

305
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:17,491
[SPEAKER_08]: If I see this on VeryDemotivational.com, I will kill you.

306
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:21,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell them what website to post it to.

307
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:23,734
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you're not John McCain.

308
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:24,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear about that?

309
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:25,895
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck happened this time?

310
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:27,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't pay attention to that loser.

311
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,237
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is funny.

312
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:33,740
[SPEAKER_02]: John McCain posted a picture of himself on the TwitPic or whatever, you know.

313
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,481
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not starting a political thing.

314
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think this is funny.

315
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:39,462
[SPEAKER_02]: If it had been Obama, it would have been funny too.

316
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:40,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Was he playing with his nipples or something?

317
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:41,243
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

318
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:43,244
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been really funny.

319
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:47,426
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he posted a picture just on his iPhone.

320
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:49,607
[SPEAKER_02]: John McCain is really old, right?

321
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:54,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So the joke is he's probably not hip with technology, but he's showing, hey, I can take a picture of myself with my iPhone.

322
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So he did that and somebody took the picture and posted it to guyswithiphones.com.

323
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,514
[SPEAKER_02]: John McCain on that website.

324
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:36,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go to guyswithiphone.com And it's like penis, penis, balls, balls Wang, wang, butt, butt, John McCain It was funny

325
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:39,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyhow.

326
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how about some housekeeping?

327
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:45,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we will actually talk about some video games tonight.

328
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:47,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a short show tonight, kids.

329
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:53,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies, but if you can't tell why, I don't know what show you're listening to.

330
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:58,041
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will be a bit of a short show tonight, meaning it's not part A, part B. It's just one giant part tonight.

331
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to try and wrap up this show by 8 o'clock.

332
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:01,483
[SPEAKER_02]: We will still take your calls.

333
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,185
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take your Twitter topics, mailbag, all that stuff.

334
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:05,106
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to neglect it.

335
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:07,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few less stories tonight so we can get out of here.

336
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reading one email.

337
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:11,156
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one email?

338
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:12,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read one.

339
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:15,120
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, what's next?

340
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,621
[SPEAKER_02]: McCain gets on Chatroulette.

341
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:17,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

342
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about the cesspool of the internet, Chatroulette.

343
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:24,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was 2chan or 4chan.

344
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:26,885
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no word to describe that.

345
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:31,407
[SPEAKER_02]: But like Chatroulette, there's some really funny YouTubes that come of Chatroulette.

346
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:37,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And my favorite is the guy that plays piano improv to the people on Chatroulette.

347
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,471
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to look this up.

348
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:39,171
[SPEAKER_02]: What's his name?

349
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:39,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Murhot?

350
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:41,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Murhot is his name, something like that.

351
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:42,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

352
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:07,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, gaming news, because we're a video game podcast.

353
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:08,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuck, yuck, yuck.

354
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Major Nelson starts off our game thing tonight.

355
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:17,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody hacked, hacksword Major Nelson's game card.

356
00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:18,935
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Major Nelson.

357
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:19,595
[SPEAKER_02]: He's famous.

358
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:23,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you're ever on the 360 and you download the Xbox, man, hi, I'm Major Nelson.

359
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:25,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at PAX East.

360
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:27,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what he sounds like, too.

361
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:32,839
[SPEAKER_02]: He always goes out to the different events, and he's the mouth for Xbox 360.

362
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:34,420
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a good thing.

363
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Major Nelson is kind of the mouth for the 360.

364
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Reggie Fils-Aimé is kind of the mouth, even though he's also the CEO.

365
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,901
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of the mouth for Nintendo.

366
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:46,102
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of associate your Wii press conference with Reggie Fils-Aimé.

367
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:48,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Sony... I don't know.

368
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:50,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony doesn't really have a mouth.

369
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:50,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

370
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:58,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's that one girl who's on the core, but I can't even think of her name.

371
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:00,429
[SPEAKER_02]: That tells you what a mouthpiece she is.

372
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So Major Nelson is kind of like the spokesman, if you will, for 360.

373
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:07,435
[SPEAKER_02]: But his gamer card was hacked.

374
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:10,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happened around the time PAX was going on.

375
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So they picked a good time to do it, honestly.

376
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:18,222
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's weird is that, like, I don't understand why you would, like, hack somebody's thing.

377
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:21,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they hacked his name to say, I'm a faggot.

378
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:23,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, ha ha, funny.

379
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:26,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you're in the third grade.

380
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:33,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I don't know, they made the text say, any account, $100 PayPal.

381
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:33,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

382
00:23:36,112 --> 00:23:50,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess meaning that you could pay these people $100 and they'll hack any account because, you know, if they can get Major Nelson, they can get your neighbor or your college friend that you're mad at or whatever as well.

383
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, somebody took responsibility for it.

384
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:57,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to say who it was because they're trash and I'm not going to promote them here on the show.

385
00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:00,965
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody took responsibility for it and they even did a YouTube video about

386
00:24:02,403 --> 00:24:03,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah.

387
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:06,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously Microsoft fixed this, but this just begs the question, why?

388
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:09,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you hack someone's gamer card?

389
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:10,607
[SPEAKER_02]: What is to gain from that?

390
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,828
[SPEAKER_08]: It's EPing, Rob, really.

391
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:18,051
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, at least like when you hack a WoW account, like, you know, in my house... It's a famous target.

392
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:24,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like when the celebrity Twitters get hacked, and like, you know, hi, I hacked Britney Spears, you know, I have a huge vagina.

393
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:28,396
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny to tweet as Britney Spears and say sick things.

394
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:30,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't understand.

395
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:31,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's no...

396
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:33,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it just seems odd.

397
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:35,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a gamer card?

398
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:38,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just hack majornelson.com?

399
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:42,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you could get people to go to your trash website automatically.

400
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'm saying you should do that, because you shouldn't.

401
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:51,077
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't understand the purpose of hacking someone's gamer card to say I'm a faggot nonetheless.

402
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:54,459
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just stupid.

403
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,340
[SPEAKER_08]: It is stupid, but you know what, Rob?

404
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,102
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're doing right now, talking about it, that's exactly why they do it.

405
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:29,385
[SPEAKER_02]: no I know which is why I didn't say the name of the site that took responsibility for it but I just think it's just weird to me like I think it does need to be talked about like why would people hack gamer cards or what's next this is so watch out don't make people too mad because they might send these guys $100 and your gamer card will be hacked next and everybody will think that you know you're a whatever 6th grade word they want to put in there to describe you so be careful

406
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:31,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they need authenticators on Xbox Live.

407
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:32,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what's going to come next?

408
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:33,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Authenticators?

409
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:34,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

410
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:36,751
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Kristen got hacked on WoW.

411
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:41,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I had read about that.

412
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,855
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are getting hacked on WoW.

413
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,637
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have an authenticator, you are going to get hacked.

414
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:46,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of time.

415
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:49,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an authenticator on my phone.

416
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not think you are immune to this.

417
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:57,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I got hacked on WoW and I am not stupid with stuff I downloaded.

418
00:25:57,525 --> 00:26:01,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't click banners on things that aren't legit and all this other stuff.

419
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I got hacked and I think I know what happened.

420
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I logged in on my ex's computer and he was stupid.

421
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:10,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think that's what happened.

422
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:10,614
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rob?

423
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:11,014
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

424
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:11,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't get hacked.

425
00:26:12,535 --> 00:26:12,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

426
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:14,075
[SPEAKER_08]: My account's disabled.

427
00:26:14,296 --> 00:26:15,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, you can't get hacked.

428
00:26:15,596 --> 00:26:16,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying for that!

429
00:26:16,457 --> 00:26:22,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, actually, I've heard of them, like, re-enabling accounts and going back in.

430
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So you gotta be careful.

431
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:25,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you are an authenticator.

432
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:25,562
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fine.

433
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:30,686
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I had a friend who his account was dormant for like six months and they re-enabled it.

434
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:40,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, they do this dirty, dirty stuff just to get in there and mine millions of ore and sell it to people.

435
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:41,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

436
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:44,836
[SPEAKER_02]: When you buy gold online, you are supporting this.

437
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:47,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I blame you as much as I blame the hackers.

438
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,200
[SPEAKER_02]: When you buy gold online, you support all these accounts getting hacked.

439
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Knock it off.

440
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:57,395
[SPEAKER_08]: If I remember right, in Star Trek Online, we actually do have a report if ever we see anything happening right away.

441
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,097
[SPEAKER_08]: It's set up in the mail and set up on the heads-up display.

442
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I think is smart.

443
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember Blizzard had anything like that.

444
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:09,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked what Ion used to do.

445
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:13,245
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to have these very public executions on the Ion server.

446
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,326
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have public executions of spammers.

447
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:16,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.

448
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:17,948
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we need in WoW.

449
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:20,890
[SPEAKER_02]: We need... This will be the nice thing.

450
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,551
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG, spoiler alert coming.

451
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:23,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Categories of spoiler.

452
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:24,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Plug your ears if you don't want it.

453
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:30,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, when Grosh takes over the Horde, since he's like a nasty little man, he should just start executing the spammers.

454
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:31,378
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to see.

455
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:33,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently he's going to be executing everyone else.

456
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So he needs to execute the spammers.

457
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:36,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, end spoiler.

458
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:36,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Safe to listen.

459
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about other stuff, Rob?

460
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:41,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

461
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:43,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I have to give a shout out to Get Games.

462
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:49,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Their ads are really funny and stylistically very good.

463
00:27:49,664 --> 00:27:49,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

464
00:27:50,324 --> 00:27:51,405
[SPEAKER_08]: As a designer, I like it.

465
00:27:51,825 --> 00:27:52,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

466
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:54,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, in Soviet Russia, games get you.

467
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:55,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Two sniffs up.

468
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:59,908
[SPEAKER_08]: But it looks like old political posters.

469
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:00,608
Hmm.

470
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:06,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, 2K Sports, they like a move in Natal.

471
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:22,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Their marketing dude, Jason Argent, said that the sports games are a natural fit for motion control and was mentioning by name the 2K Major League Baseball series.

472
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:28,626
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't really give anything else up on that, but I think that they're pretty pleased with it and going to keep it going.

473
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,487
[SPEAKER_08]: So, good for them.

474
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:34,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Rob, what do you think?

475
00:28:35,898 --> 00:28:51,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I should be able to get that big orange bat that you recently dug up, apparently according to your Facebook and with Natal, I should be able to use that bat as I play 2K games You'd have to come over here to get it Because I won't break anything at all doing that in my house The orange bat is awesome

476
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:54,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

477
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:19,600
[SPEAKER_02]: But this seems like a natural progression.

478
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what smarter thing to do than to incorporate that with established franchises?

479
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:32,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a lightsaber.

480
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:38,029
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this brings a whole new level to Rod Calibur, Rob.

481
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:38,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

482
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:59,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I think though I hope that what these games do is make this support optional and I think they will I think they know that there's still a hardcore audience especially when you're talking about 2K and you know who knows whatever EA Sports ends up doing I think they still know there's a very hardcore audience that does not want to stand there and flail their arms everywhere to pretend you know what have you

483
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:15,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like what they do you know it's weird we don't talk about sports games a lot on this show but I kind of like what they do with Madden is that on the Wii they really make the Wii game kind of targeted as the easy type game if you will and then the 360 and the PS3 versions are for the hardcore

484
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:18,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I don't know.

485
00:30:18,703 --> 00:30:20,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they should do separate versions.

486
00:30:20,104 --> 00:30:21,805
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just be one version with two different modes.

487
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:23,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see what they do.

488
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:24,407
[SPEAKER_02]: You alright over there?

489
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:27,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like death is on the show tonight.

490
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:28,230
[SPEAKER_02]: This is amazing.

491
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even look like myself, Rob.

492
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:35,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe you put that picture on the website.

493
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:38,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

494
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:40,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care anymore.

495
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,721
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's fine.

496
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:41,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

497
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:42,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's in don't give a shit mode.

498
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:48,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com quickly before DarkSakura realizes what she did.

499
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:50,889
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's really a horrid picture.

500
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,632
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I've ever looked that bad in my life.

501
00:30:55,513 --> 00:30:56,354
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what we need?

502
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:59,677
[SPEAKER_02]: We need like a blingy competition with that picture.

503
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:12,487
[SPEAKER_02]: A blingy, haven't you ever, well you don't use MySpace, so blingy is the site that puts the glitter and the hearts and all that just MySpace trash all over a picture.

504
00:31:13,027 --> 00:31:17,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody needs to take your picture and blingy-fy it to make it pretty.

505
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:20,054
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the most horrible picture of you ever.

506
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:24,618
[SPEAKER_02]: What is wrong with this show tonight?

507
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, we need you.

508
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I came home and I washed my face and I was like, fuck it, I don't care how it looks tonight.

509
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:34,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's just you.

510
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:35,545
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just me.

511
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:36,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just little old me.

512
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Rob.

513
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:37,746
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just me.

514
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:38,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

515
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:40,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I love these Vicks inhaler things though.

516
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:41,428
[SPEAKER_08]: They're perfect.

517
00:31:42,449 --> 00:31:43,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to get one.

518
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:43,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

519
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,350
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

520
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I feel okay.

521
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:46,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting better.

522
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:48,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just last week was bad.

523
00:31:48,813 --> 00:31:52,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach for a living and I couldn't talk Wednesday and Thursday and that's bad for a teacher.

524
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:54,536
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really bad.

525
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:59,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Toegak, by the way, is blingifying your picture right now.

526
00:31:59,515 --> 00:32:00,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.

527
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:01,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Please do not.

528
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Really.

529
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:06,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I'll never put another picture of me online again.

530
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:09,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Toegak, send it to me private message, okay?

531
00:32:09,148 --> 00:32:10,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't post it publicly.

532
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:11,672
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

533
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:16,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, at least you're not a dirty thief.

534
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,060
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

535
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:06,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that makes it okay.

536
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:10,596
[SPEAKER_02]: He stole about 14 megs of the code before somebody caught him.

537
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:12,937
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so messed up.

538
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:16,880
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, the alleged thief, Justin D. May.

539
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:20,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Wilmington, Delaware is where he lives, apparently.

540
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:23,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got a lovely little picture all over the internet now.

541
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:25,747
[SPEAKER_02]: His little mugshot hit all the gaming blogs.

542
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:32,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, he said, I got online using the Ethernet cable hanging outside their booth because Wi-Fi wasn't working.

543
00:33:32,648 --> 00:33:35,570
[SPEAKER_02]: They stopped me, checked my computer, and saw the Xbox Neighborhood application.

544
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was on there, they accused me of stealing Breach, even though it's not on my computer.

545
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:41,576
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he's saying in his defense.

546
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:42,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

547
00:33:44,867 --> 00:34:05,374
[SPEAKER_02]: apparently though the Atomic staff is counter responding to this saying he said several times he knew people and could give us bigger and more important people and he could name names however I have no idea if these people are on the show floor or just hackers at home I would hate to think he got someone's full code and their title is going to be compromised due to this guy I just need to make it clear he didn't say anything specific boy oh boy

548
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:19,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently this guy, oh my god, this guy apparently even spoke up at a panel earlier in the day about Xbox Live Enforcement and the thief wanted to get his gamer tag unbanned.

549
00:34:20,253 --> 00:34:25,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Stephen Tolous, I probably mispronounced that wrong, Tolous, I'm distracted by Jamie's nose blowing.

550
00:34:26,074 --> 00:34:37,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Stephen Tolous, the Director of Policy and Enforcement for Xbox Live actually asked the guy what he did and the hacker said he played Forza 3 before release and he said, well, you shouldn't have done that.

551
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:45,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you buy games early from a retailer that breaks street date, that doesn't get players banned, but illegal pre-release play does.

552
00:34:47,846 --> 00:34:48,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Good gosh.

553
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,327
[SPEAKER_02]: What a mess.

554
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:55,889
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100, Matt in our chatroom says, How stupid does this kid have to be to steal a game that had an ex-Marine at the booth?

555
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't steal shit, especially when there are 60,000 witnesses around.

556
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:05,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't steal shit to begin with, but really don't steal shit when there's that many people around.

557
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:08,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes the best thefts happen in plain sight.

558
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:09,836
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just dumb.

559
00:35:10,156 --> 00:35:10,757
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a dummy.

560
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:14,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about something else that's dumb?

561
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:17,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I kind of get it, but I still think it's a little on the stupid side.

562
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:26,201
[SPEAKER_08]: The 3.21 firmware update for PS3 removes the option to install other OS.

563
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:29,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So, no more Linux.

564
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:34,464
[SPEAKER_08]: They're getting rid of that because of security concerns, they said.

565
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:39,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to start taking features away from our PlayStation.

566
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:40,852
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, nope, you know what?

567
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,113
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't have this feature anymore.

568
00:35:42,513 --> 00:35:42,973
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

569
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:45,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Not smart of Sony to do.

570
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:46,896
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?

571
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:52,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Sony is getting cocky with all this hacking scene thing.

572
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just point to the PSP.

573
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time Sony releases some patch, they say it's unhackable, unwinnable.

574
00:35:58,563 --> 00:35:59,764
[SPEAKER_02]: The hackers will never succeed.

575
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:01,345
[SPEAKER_02]: They will never hack the PSP.

576
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:02,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It is unhackable.

577
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:03,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Two days later, it's hacked.

578
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:06,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is what I say.

579
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:08,915
[SPEAKER_08]: If people want something badly enough, they'll find a way to make it happen.

580
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:15,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sure enough, they're going to shut off this because apparently there's some exploit now in the PS3 Linux.

581
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised it took that long.

582
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,847
[SPEAKER_02]: But now they are taking away... One bad apple ruins the barrel.

583
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:21,148
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking it away from everybody.

584
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:26,448
[SPEAKER_02]: and saying, well, this exploit is just undoable now.

585
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:30,090
[SPEAKER_02]: We took away Linux, so now you can't do this at all.

586
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:43,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is a hacker named George Hotz, who was an iPhone hacker, who apparently did crack the code on PS3, and then that's what might have started this whole thing.

587
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:56,534
[SPEAKER_02]: but the point is is that if people want the hack bad enough there will be something that will reverse engineer the PS3 back to the old patch I mean they do it all the time with the PSP

588
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:58,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

589
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:04,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I think though for the majority of people, for the common person, hardly anyone's going to notice this happen.

590
00:37:04,454 --> 00:37:08,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on listeners, how many of you were really using this feature?

591
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe there's going to be a couple of you that are like, me, me, me, me.

592
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:21,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if that's you, then you're probably continuing to use your PS3 for its Linux features and therefore you're not going to want to take your PS3 on PlayStation Network and get the update.

593
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:35,759
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's the only way you're going to be forced to update is when you try to play a game online or if you try to buy a new game, you know, that eventually, you know, the firmware will be on the disks for that later game, Uncharted 3 or whatever game comes later that everybody has to have.

594
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:41,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, it's pretty big.

595
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I might just put this in the chat room.

596
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:49,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the way this guy has done it, I actually could see why Sony would make some changes.

597
00:37:50,008 --> 00:37:52,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just a matter of time before he finds another.

598
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:56,409
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll find an exploit in a game or something to reverse the firmware back to something old.

599
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:57,729
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the PSP all the time.

600
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure if Loki were here, he'd say he'd already done it.

601
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's just...

602
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:11,646
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too bad that Sony felt the need to patch it out for everyone because this was found when this isn't going to stop it.

603
00:38:11,746 --> 00:38:12,447
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my point.

604
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,531
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not going to stop the hacking process.

605
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make it more difficult, yeah, but it's not going to stop it.

606
00:38:18,565 --> 00:38:20,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that really want to do it are still going to do it.

607
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:23,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just kind of a bummer to those that were using Linux legitimately.

608
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:27,951
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I just can't think of a whole lots of reasons.

609
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:36,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, the computer in there was kind of unique, but I think if you harnessed its power for whatever, you're not really playing games with it, and therefore you won't be affected anyway.

610
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:39,779
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just going to be such a minority of users affected by this.

611
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,780
[SPEAKER_02]: But it still sucks for them.

612
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:44,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You should send those angry cards and letters to Sony.

613
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:48,422
[SPEAKER_02]: What I love about the patch that they did, didn't add a damn thing.

614
00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:49,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't add anything.

615
00:38:49,603 --> 00:38:52,003
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no silver lining to this patch.

616
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,244
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, yep, we're just taking this feature away.

617
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:54,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

618
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:01,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Toagak says, actually, they are having issues downgrading the PSP from recent firmware as well.

619
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:02,827
[SPEAKER_02]: God, it's getting harder.

620
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:04,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to stop them.

621
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:07,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't stop them.

622
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, moving on to other news regarding the Xbox and talking about Game Room.

623
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:17,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Game Room a little bit here and there.

624
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it overall.

625
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:26,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they probably should have waited about three more months to release it for them to work out some of the bugs, but whatever.

626
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:27,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

627
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:30,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It's showing promise.

628
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:30,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it that way.

629
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:31,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It's showing promise.

630
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Room Game Room

631
00:39:57,088 --> 00:40:00,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were hoping for more games, nope, not going to happen right away.

632
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:08,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to Pitfall and Kaboom and some of the other Activision classics and who knows what other little arcade gems they might dig up.

633
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:08,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Burger time, anyone?

634
00:40:10,193 --> 00:40:11,774
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not going to start seeing those until late April.

635
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:17,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting tidbit, by the way, because I don't think this came up on our show.

636
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:23,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I mentioned it on Bobby's show on the call, but I actually was with a pal, Seg.

637
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:27,487
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Seg was playing Game Room on the show floor at Microsoft's booth.

638
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:31,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really funny is that he actually got the blue screen to death on the game.

639
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:39,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, it seemed like all he did was set the controller down on top of the computer and it just threw the whole damn thing off balance and it blue screened to death right in front of everybody.

640
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:47,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were playing Game Room on the show floor, and before he managed to crash the thing, I asked the guy, I said, so they're going to be doing weekly releases with this?

641
00:40:47,702 --> 00:40:49,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard something like a thousand games.

642
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:50,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, I don't have a media badge on.

643
00:40:51,024 --> 00:40:53,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go to Pax's Media, so I'm just the everyday gamer.

644
00:40:54,686 --> 00:41:05,873
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy said to me, he said, well, I don't know if weekly releases is what they're going to end up doing, but they want to look at doing regular releases.

645
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,194
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if it'll be weekly.

646
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're already starting to backtrack a little bit.

647
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:10,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Releases that eat their fiber?

648
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not be regular.

649
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:13,972
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

650
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,978
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be just sporadic and all over the place.

651
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a McDonald's inspired release.

652
00:41:23,786 --> 00:41:25,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about other stuff?

653
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:25,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

654
00:41:26,247 --> 00:41:27,247
[SPEAKER_08]: How about Miyamoto?

655
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:28,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I think being a little foolish.

656
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:44,231
[SPEAKER_08]: He basically thinks that Nintendo has a responsibility to educate the larger audiences about the benefits of gaming that he thinks that most people are afraid of gaming technology.

657
00:41:45,431 --> 00:41:45,671
[SPEAKER_08]: That

658
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,611
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, once they become accustomed to it, there's nothing to be afraid at all.

659
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:51,912
[SPEAKER_08]: How about just people don't like games?

660
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them just don't like video games.

661
00:41:56,593 --> 00:41:57,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a little truth to that.

662
00:41:57,934 --> 00:42:00,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, my parents don't like video games.

663
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:01,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

664
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:04,816
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad doesn't care, but he doesn't really play them.

665
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are a lot of people that don't get games.

666
00:42:08,577 --> 00:42:11,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, going back to PAX a little bit,

667
00:42:12,386 --> 00:42:19,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the whole, you know, people were very moved by Wil Wheaton's opening speech and all this stuff, which I get because it was very rah, rah, rah.

668
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:20,850
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our culture.

669
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,770
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our time.

670
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,571
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your place.

671
00:42:22,951 --> 00:42:24,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's going to judge you here.

672
00:42:24,452 --> 00:42:26,333
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be a gamer here and nobody's going to care.

673
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:32,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, that says to me that even we as gamers recognize that not everybody gets gaming.

674
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:34,356
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

675
00:42:34,656 --> 00:42:35,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't get me wrong.

676
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:36,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's ridiculous.

677
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:39,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, games are no different than movies in my opinion.

678
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:43,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know... It's interactive entertainment.

679
00:42:43,703 --> 00:42:45,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interactive entertainment.

680
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:47,807
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Nookie is interactive entertainment.

681
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:50,450
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it just depends on what you like.

682
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:55,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't get people that hate on games, but I think we recognize there are people that just don't get it for whatever reason.

683
00:42:56,836 --> 00:42:58,338
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff I don't get.

684
00:42:58,518 --> 00:42:59,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Like The Hills.

685
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard The Hills got cancelled finally.

686
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:05,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It took like five years for this to happen.

687
00:43:05,744 --> 00:43:06,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get the hills.

688
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:09,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Heidi and Spencer, why are they famous?

689
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:09,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

690
00:43:09,472 --> 00:43:10,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get that.

691
00:43:11,596 --> 00:43:14,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people don't get why Final Fantasy XIII is awesome.

692
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:39,263
[SPEAKER_02]: so there are people out there that just aren't going to get games I mean wasn't that Nintendo's whole little thing was that they were going to try and make games more accessible to everybody and they somewhat I don't know I think they somewhat succeeded I mean they've sold tons of consoles and people are all about you know Wii Fit and Wii Sports and all these games that have seemed to cross over into the mainstream you know

693
00:43:40,146 --> 00:43:42,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, there is a quote from him I want to read.

694
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:44,510
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to do with Sony and Microsoft.

695
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:53,877
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel it's an honor that some form of entertainment style we created is now going to be taken for granted thanks to the attitude taken by other companies.

696
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:57,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Meaning their adoption of motion control.

697
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:02,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha, so it's the kind of thing where it's like, well, everybody else seems to agree.

698
00:44:02,384 --> 00:44:04,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Imitation is the best form of...

699
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:14,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, you're forgetting, Microsoft does an incredibly good job of stealing people's ideas and making them better.

700
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:17,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what they're trying to do with this whole Natal thing.

701
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:19,266
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to make it better.

702
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:20,606
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

703
00:44:20,646 --> 00:44:21,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's still debatable.

704
00:44:21,606 --> 00:44:27,708
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really argue that until the system or game or whatever you want to call it itself comes out.

705
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:28,288
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

706
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:33,716
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation Move, you know, some of the early feedback was pretty good that it's way more responsive than the Wii.

707
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:35,999
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just competition, my friends.

708
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Competition.

709
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:39,325
[SPEAKER_02]: All these companies trying to one-up each other.

710
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:48,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, there are a lot of companies out there that are currently trying to get your dollar as far as selling their video games.

711
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll start with Japan this week for the release dates.

712
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:52,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the release dates.

713
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of new games on the 360 in Japan this week, but a crap ton of price reductions.

714
00:44:57,203 --> 00:45:04,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Smiles, Far Cry 2, Mass Effect, Ninja Blade, Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy, Hawk, all getting price reductions this week.

715
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:08,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to the PlayStation 3.

716
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:11,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, just price reductions.

717
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:11,951
[SPEAKER_02]: No new games.

718
00:45:12,191 --> 00:45:16,113
[SPEAKER_02]: X-Blades and Tom Clancy's HAWK or Hux.

719
00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:17,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo Wii, nothing this week.

720
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:19,434
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really kind of a dry week.

721
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:22,856
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2, Clover, no Kuni, no Alice.

722
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:25,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the only new game I'm seeing there on the PlayStation 2.

723
00:45:25,937 --> 00:45:27,118
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Nintendo DS.

724
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, nothing really new this week.

725
00:45:31,421 --> 00:45:32,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a slow week.

726
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:32,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

727
00:45:32,582 --> 00:45:36,224
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd think like there's a Dragon Warrior game or something coming out or everything's getting out of the way.

728
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:39,906
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PSP, Monochrome is coming out this week.

729
00:45:39,947 --> 00:45:41,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's the sequel to Echochrome.

730
00:45:42,288 --> 00:45:55,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is one other game coming out, Jude no Atelier, Grimmonaut no Rekinjutsu, Toraware no Morito from Gust, which is, well, it looks like there's this like, let's see.

731
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:14,774
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like a time traveling game and cute little slime looking characters and little teddy bears and cute stuff and chicks with enormous breasts so you're very like anime infused game it's a PSP remake apparently of an older game so there you go

732
00:46:15,802 --> 00:46:27,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a couple of UK releases if you're ready Yippee Just two Blue Toad Murder Files Episodes 4, 5, and 6 And Lead and Gold Gangs of the Wild West That's it

733
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:30,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

734
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:51,776
[SPEAKER_02]: a game called Again on the DS.

735
00:46:51,996 --> 00:46:53,838
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an action game from Koei Entertainment.

736
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:59,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my personal favorite here of the week that's coming out, Squishy Tank on the Nintendo DS.

737
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:00,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the cover.

738
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it's from Natsume.

739
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:03,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the cover art.

740
00:47:03,665 --> 00:47:04,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a puzzle game.

741
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:15,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the cover art, it looks like imagine a slime from the Dragon Quest series and somebody is poking it and so it has the angry face because it's being poked, yet it is a tank.

742
00:47:16,676 --> 00:47:17,917
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

743
00:47:19,821 --> 00:47:21,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Squishy Tank for $20.

744
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:22,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Squithy.

745
00:47:23,403 --> 00:47:24,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a puzzle game.

746
00:47:24,644 --> 00:47:28,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like match-up colored blocks and make tanks squishy.

747
00:47:28,883 --> 00:47:29,583
[SPEAKER_02]: and Squizzy.

748
00:47:29,883 --> 00:47:30,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Squizzy.

749
00:47:32,124 --> 00:47:34,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're ready to get into, I guess, the mailbag.

750
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,705
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at that part of the show where we're going to dive into the mailbag and read some of your emails here.

751
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:38,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading three.

752
00:47:39,046 --> 00:47:41,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura will try her best to not sniff through them all.

753
00:47:41,586 --> 00:47:42,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you everyone for keeping them short.

754
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,888
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, if you want to send us emails, please do.

755
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:48,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, hopefully, we'll be better.

756
00:47:48,688 --> 00:47:55,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place you send emails and DarkSakura reads them like she's going to do right now while I munch on this tortilla.

757
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR.

758
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:58,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you haven't eaten it yet?

759
00:47:59,562 --> 00:48:00,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking.

760
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:01,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't eat and talk.

761
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:02,643
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll fucking eat already.

762
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:03,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you talk.

763
00:48:03,504 --> 00:48:03,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll eat.

764
00:48:04,264 --> 00:48:05,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know how it is.

765
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:06,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR.

766
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:11,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I was listening to your podcast at work and noticed Rob wonder why Final Fight and Magic Sword are getting packaged together.

767
00:48:12,048 --> 00:48:12,528
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason?

768
00:48:12,608 --> 00:48:17,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Simply that the developers of the company who are doing the port love Magic Sword.

769
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:21,533
[SPEAKER_08]: The only way they would have been able to get it released is to bundle it with another game.

770
00:48:22,373 --> 00:48:28,321
[SPEAKER_08]: So can you... So you can think they're completely selfish acts as the reason you're getting Magic Sword.

771
00:48:28,602 --> 00:48:30,464
[SPEAKER_08]: P. A-Z-H-P.

772
00:48:31,025 --> 00:48:31,386
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

773
00:48:31,446 --> 00:48:32,968
[SPEAKER_08]: When Rob asks Loki to be a lady...

774
00:48:34,932 --> 00:48:40,115
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason I had an image of Rob singing Loki Be A Lady to the tune of Luck Be A Lady by Frank Sinatra.

775
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:40,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that.

776
00:48:41,696 --> 00:48:42,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki Be A Lady tonight.

777
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, if you've been a lady to begin with, Loki Be A Lady tonight.

778
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:46,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I really did that on the show.

779
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:47,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I told Loki to be a lady.

780
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:50,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently I was drunk.

781
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:53,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

782
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:53,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the email.

783
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:57,926
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be more random tangents and acts of love.

784
00:48:58,106 --> 00:48:59,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's Guardian Legend fans out there.

785
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:00,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Help me out.

786
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:03,561
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you.

787
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:05,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited about Magic Sword I could piddle.

788
00:49:07,003 --> 00:49:07,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

789
00:49:08,805 --> 00:49:09,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Next one.

790
00:49:11,427 --> 00:49:13,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Originals Radio and fellow listeners.

791
00:49:13,529 --> 00:49:14,009
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Jeet.

792
00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:14,810
[SPEAKER_08]: It's writing in again.

793
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:26,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing as it's my birthday today, then that I am in the process of getting ready for a night out, I realize I won't be able to attend the live show today, which I regret as it is always something fun and enlightening.

794
00:49:27,672 --> 00:49:33,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember myself when I was under the age of 18 and had no problem purchasing one of the worst slash best murder simulators of all time, Grand Theft Auto 3.

795
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:57,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not really shocked that I managed to pull it off, but I am a bit dismayed that the retailers don't seem to care.

796
00:49:57,504 --> 00:50:04,791
[SPEAKER_08]: So the question is, Do you think it's too easy for children to acquire mature rated games, or are the measures taken by retailers good enough?

797
00:50:05,592 --> 00:50:10,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry for any and all spelling errors and or grammatical mistakes, and have a happy Easter, everyone.

798
00:50:11,037 --> 00:50:12,058
[SPEAKER_08]: G. Ditz, The Other Swede

799
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:15,118
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

800
00:50:33,229 --> 00:50:35,512
[SPEAKER_08]: If the kid gets the game that's on the parent, not on the store.

801
00:50:36,953 --> 00:50:38,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I pretty much agree with DarkSakura.

802
00:50:38,675 --> 00:50:39,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.

803
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:41,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Stores do the best they can.

804
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:47,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if stores are shown to not be following the rules, then action should be taken accordingly.

805
00:50:48,106 --> 00:50:50,648
[SPEAKER_02]: They do the same thing with cigarettes and alcohol and all this stuff.

806
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:52,510
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately, it's up to the parents.

807
00:50:53,291 --> 00:51:03,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you don't know if somebody might have an older brother who will go in and buy the game for them or a friend who's older, a cousin, I don't know, that's kind of like the hookup.

808
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,579
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing the stores can do about that.

809
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And if a kid wants an M-rated game bad enough and finds that hookup, then they're going to do it.

810
00:51:10,823 --> 00:51:15,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless the parents say, if I catch you playing that game, I'm going to fucking throw your Xbox in the trash.

811
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:17,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something my parents would have said.

812
00:51:19,148 --> 00:51:20,910
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it ultimately comes down to.

813
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:22,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my mom would have said, when did you get this?

814
00:51:23,171 --> 00:51:23,591
Rob, that is gross.

815
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:26,253
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that game that you're playing?

816
00:51:26,273 --> 00:51:27,434
[SPEAKER_02]: That is gross.

817
00:51:27,474 --> 00:51:28,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, did he just knock the head off?

818
00:51:28,715 --> 00:51:29,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, what are you playing?

819
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:57,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Mortal Kombat Fatalities are funny.

820
00:52:11,118 --> 00:52:11,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Last one.

821
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:19,702
[SPEAKER_08]: He put a lot of information on here, but I'm not going to say it until I have his express permission to.

822
00:52:21,362 --> 00:52:22,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR.

823
00:52:22,563 --> 00:52:26,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to give you a quick update on the whole fiasco going on with GameCrazy.

824
00:52:26,825 --> 00:52:28,705
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the guy who's the manager in Colorado.

825
00:52:28,805 --> 00:52:29,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.

826
00:52:30,726 --> 00:52:37,768
[SPEAKER_08]: My store, along with four others in the Denver slash Pueblo area, the only two stores in Colorado remain, is now starting liquidation this Friday.

827
00:52:38,528 --> 00:52:43,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, I really hope that Dan is still safe, and if not, I guess we are all in this together.

828
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:48,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Wish me luck with everything that will be coming my and or our way.

829
00:52:49,651 --> 00:52:56,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And to think I almost bought a 3D HDTV at Best Buy yesterday, but my little guardian angel was telling me not to, and now I know why.

830
00:52:56,993 --> 00:52:57,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Frowny face.

831
00:52:58,693 --> 00:53:00,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Please let me know what is going on in your neck of the woods.

832
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:05,340
[SPEAKER_08]: One good thing to pass on, a lot of my customers are now listening to your show and love it, so keep it up.

833
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, dude.

834
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:09,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I apologize to your customer base for tonight's show.

835
00:53:10,506 --> 00:53:12,948
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sorry to hear it, dude.

836
00:53:12,968 --> 00:53:13,629
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not cool.

837
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:16,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it works out for the best.

838
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:18,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I hope you're able to find something somewhere else.

839
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those customers are going to have to go somewhere, so...

840
00:53:21,837 --> 00:53:24,880
[SPEAKER_08]: This is also dated from March 22nd, so he might have heard already.

841
00:53:25,761 --> 00:53:26,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan dodged the bullet.

842
00:53:27,182 --> 00:53:27,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

843
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:28,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for him.

844
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:32,647
[SPEAKER_08]: They closed down a bunch of other stores, but Dan's store was still a pretty well-performing store.

845
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:35,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's like, we didn't get any inventory.

846
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:38,952
[SPEAKER_08]: We were running out and we were sad and we thought we were going to go.

847
00:53:39,473 --> 00:53:40,834
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we got a shipment.

848
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:43,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they said, yeah.

849
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:45,558
[SPEAKER_08]: So Dan's store is still around for a little bit.

850
00:53:45,978 --> 00:53:46,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan is also awesome.

851
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:53,106
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a thought that his might be one of the ones to survive Chapter 11 if the company survives.

852
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:58,472
[SPEAKER_08]: He just said he was a little disappointed because he hates driving to Cameron Park.

853
00:53:59,333 --> 00:53:59,854
[SPEAKER_08]: That's far.

854
00:54:00,795 --> 00:54:01,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never been there.

855
00:54:02,337 --> 00:54:04,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It snows and shit there, doesn't it?

856
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:05,881
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of far.

857
00:54:06,281 --> 00:54:17,342
[SPEAKER_08]: so um manager dude which I'm calling you until you say I can actually say it's you I mean it put a store number and everything but I don't want to jump the gun yeah yeah um

858
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:22,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I say write it out through liquidation.

859
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Take your unemployment.

860
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:28,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that you... Oh my god, this show is so broken.

861
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:29,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

862
00:54:29,852 --> 00:54:32,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope that something works out well for you.

863
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:35,837
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for, by the way, spreading us around like a disease.

864
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:37,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.

865
00:54:37,918 --> 00:54:38,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Robin, you know what?

866
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:40,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I ever tell you about the Dorbola?

867
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:41,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-uh.

868
00:54:41,882 --> 00:54:44,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the... Not Anime Expo.

869
00:54:45,004 --> 00:54:45,245
[SPEAKER_08]: It was...

870
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Faname 2000, I think.

871
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:52,203
[SPEAKER_08]: My first Faname.

872
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:53,804
[SPEAKER_08]: When I did my Emmy cosplay.

873
00:54:54,685 --> 00:55:06,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, all the Bay Area DDR players and everything were getting sick from an illness that was, in theory, started by a certain moderator at the time on DDR Freak.

874
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:09,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought, oh, I'm not going to get it.

875
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:10,035
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all over.

876
00:55:10,075 --> 00:55:10,916
[SPEAKER_08]: The epidemic's gone.

877
00:55:11,036 --> 00:55:13,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I came back home sick with Dorbola.

878
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:14,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes.

879
00:55:15,018 --> 00:55:15,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear it.

880
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Con, con crap.

881
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:18,742
[SPEAKER_08]: But no.

882
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:25,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did get your email on my personal email address and I've just been swamped, so.

883
00:55:26,008 --> 00:55:35,716
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I have heard that there are game stores out there and like little computer places, well, not little, but you know, like LAN centers and stuff that actually play this show at the center.

884
00:55:36,136 --> 00:55:37,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's rad.

885
00:55:37,257 --> 00:55:38,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, thank you guys so much.

886
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:42,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we really ought to tone down the swearing so that it would be okay for more places to play us.

887
00:55:42,802 --> 00:55:43,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I said crap.

888
00:55:43,582 --> 00:55:44,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't say shit.

889
00:55:45,603 --> 00:55:45,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

890
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:54,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet we're a heck of a lot more interesting than those stupid tapes they probably send them to play with all the like, you know, Hi, I'm Jeff Keighley and let's see what game's coming out next.

891
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:59,750
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like that stuff probably gets really old to see on loop over and over again.

892
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:02,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, podcasts are kind of fun.

893
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:05,712
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to think about cleaning it up someday.

894
00:56:05,752 --> 00:56:06,992
[SPEAKER_08]: We're verbal kitsch, Rob.

895
00:56:07,172 --> 00:56:08,233
[SPEAKER_08]: We're verbal kitsch.

896
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:14,155
[SPEAKER_08]: But back to the subject at hand, dude, I feel really rotten for you.

897
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:20,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Shoot me another email to my real email and I will respond to you.

898
00:56:21,677 --> 00:56:26,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just so sorry that this crap is happening.

899
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:30,440
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of it is their own fault for their marketing strategy.

900
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:34,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that GameStop really started dominating the market.

901
00:56:34,966 --> 00:56:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: You might just want to send with your email, though, some E. Perel.

902
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:41,307
[SPEAKER_02]: As SalaciousPop in chat says, this episode needs to come with some Perel.

903
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:47,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's about to go flush her head in the toilet to get it to stop hurting.

904
00:56:47,548 --> 00:56:52,089
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, backing up to some earlier messages in chat room from when I was impersonating my mother.

905
00:56:52,629 --> 00:56:55,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Mamesatsuma says, Sky's parents were from Sesame Street.

906
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:55,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, apparently.

907
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Tigerclaw said, Rob was probably like, hey mom, watch this.

908
00:57:00,091 --> 00:57:02,331
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a fatality in the game and she just goes ballistic.

909
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:03,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

910
00:57:21,258 --> 00:57:27,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Julian went up to Becky and picked his nose and said, Yummy!

911
00:57:27,503 --> 00:57:29,365
[SPEAKER_08]: With a big grin on his face.

912
00:57:30,206 --> 00:57:31,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to, I guess, see reaction.

913
00:57:32,628 --> 00:57:34,509
[SPEAKER_08]: This two-year-old has mastered smart, Rob.

914
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,272
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a smart kid.

915
00:57:41,235 --> 00:57:42,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he shook his head and goes, Yucky.

916
00:57:42,956 --> 00:57:43,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yucky.

917
00:57:46,103 --> 00:58:12,527
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt says no don't tone down the language everybody's getting freaked out that we're suddenly going to go G-rated no we're not going to tone down the language it would be nice if I had the time or one of us had the time or somebody had the time that we could go through the episode and beep out obscenities and that way you could have like a G-rated version you know safe for broadcast but let's face it we're all too lazy it's not going to happen I mean Loki's on this program I mean there's just it's not going to happen not going to happen

918
00:58:13,328 --> 00:58:16,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, by the way, if you want to send in some emails, you should do so.

919
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:19,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send them.

920
00:58:20,451 --> 00:58:25,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Now's the part of the show where we show a little angst and anger and say, F you, man.

921
00:58:25,554 --> 00:58:25,854
[SPEAKER_02]: F you.

922
00:58:42,665 --> 00:58:44,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll start the FUs tonight.

923
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:44,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, you're back?

924
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:45,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hi.

925
00:58:45,568 --> 00:58:46,649
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura starts off tonight.

926
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you.

927
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:50,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit.

928
00:58:50,372 --> 00:58:51,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Something fell.

929
00:58:53,295 --> 00:58:57,679
[SPEAKER_08]: A few of my allergies and the Sacramento area for being rife with plant life.

930
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it all burns.

931
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:01,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for me and my stuff.

932
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:02,723
[SPEAKER_08]: And yours.

933
00:59:03,464 --> 00:59:04,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to see your new house.

934
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quaint.

935
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:08,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Come over next week.

936
00:59:08,723 --> 00:59:10,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, you have other stuff next weekend.

937
00:59:10,564 --> 00:59:11,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Come over soon.

938
00:59:12,045 --> 00:59:13,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's have breakfast on Sunday.

939
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:14,667
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll see.

940
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,911
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to Pax East Plague.

941
00:59:19,331 --> 00:59:20,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I the only one that has it?

942
00:59:20,912 --> 00:59:21,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I am.

943
00:59:22,334 --> 00:59:23,575
[SPEAKER_02]: F you, Pax East Plague.

944
00:59:23,915 --> 00:59:31,301
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to say non-F you to these lovely triple chocolate M&Ms that DarkSakura just gave me.

945
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: They are purple and sparkly.

946
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:33,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take pictures of them.

947
00:59:33,623 --> 00:59:35,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the gayest food I think I've ever seen.

948
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:37,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, that's what I said in the kitchen.

949
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I'm going to bring you some of the gayest food I've ever eaten.

950
00:59:40,027 --> 00:59:43,410
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very gay.

951
00:59:45,732 --> 00:59:47,373
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt in the chat.

952
00:59:47,413 --> 00:59:48,293
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good question.

953
00:59:49,694 --> 00:59:53,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure, we'll let chatters derail the flow of the show tonight because I don't care tonight.

954
00:59:53,197 --> 00:59:54,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this show is already fucked up as it is.

955
00:59:55,539 --> 00:59:57,700
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, serious question for you.

956
00:59:58,241 --> 01:00:01,043
[SPEAKER_02]: What did your parents think of you guys playing DDR?

957
01:00:02,574 --> 01:00:04,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution, the game that brought this show together.

958
01:00:05,176 --> 01:00:06,717
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what did your parents think?

959
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, well, you were really living with your parents at that time.

960
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to explain it to my mom.

961
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:11,841
[SPEAKER_08]: She was like, what?

962
01:00:14,283 --> 01:00:15,864
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty much it with my parents, too.

963
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, I'd moved out of the house by then.

964
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:19,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I was living on my own.

965
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:22,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been like, God, what year did we all start playing DDR?

966
01:00:23,009 --> 01:00:24,470
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 2000 for me.

967
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:25,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd have been 21.

968
01:00:25,531 --> 01:00:26,852
[SPEAKER_02]: You were just a young'un.

969
01:00:26,872 --> 01:00:27,412
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years ago, I'd have been 21.

970
01:00:27,452 --> 01:00:27,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

971
01:00:30,274 --> 01:00:53,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already out of the house by then so my parents didn't really know but they found out later on because when we started doing the tournaments and stuff like remember we ended up on the news sometimes and then like you know our show ended up on the news and some of that stuff and so my parents were kind of like okay well like I think they just don't get it I think my mom just kind of giggles like I think she kind of points and laughs at me but doesn't like outright do that because I'm her kid

972
01:00:54,723 --> 01:01:01,727
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

973
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:04,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just in that kind of mood tonight where I don't really care.

974
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:06,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.

975
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give somebody a call.

976
01:01:09,951 --> 01:01:10,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find out.

977
01:01:11,191 --> 01:01:12,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I need to know.

978
01:01:13,392 --> 01:01:13,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

979
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:17,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to know the answer to this question.

980
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,375
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very good question that S.J.

981
01:01:18,415 --> 01:01:19,135
[SPEAKER_02]: and her mat's posing.

982
01:01:26,357 --> 01:01:27,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi mom, it's Rob.

983
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:31,361
[SPEAKER_02]: She hung up on me.

984
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,481
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother just hung up on me.

985
01:01:35,823 --> 01:01:37,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe she doesn't want to be on the radio.

986
01:01:37,244 --> 01:01:37,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try this again.

987
01:01:38,105 --> 01:01:39,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio, boys and girls.

988
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:46,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it working?

989
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid Skype.

990
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try this one more time.

991
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:51,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm going to give up.

992
01:01:55,540 --> 01:02:04,585
[SPEAKER_02]: We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific.

993
01:02:04,645 --> 01:02:07,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, All Games Radio, for letting us steal your bandwidth.

994
01:02:07,907 --> 01:02:09,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Scott has a new show starting, Appaday TV.

995
01:02:10,088 --> 01:02:10,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that out.

996
01:02:10,948 --> 01:02:11,689
[SPEAKER_08]: We can call mine.

997
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:12,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

998
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:13,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, it's Rob.

999
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:13,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you there?

1000
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:15,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here.

1001
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:16,852
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep hanging up on me.

1002
01:02:16,952 --> 01:02:18,112
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't hang up on you.

1003
01:02:18,172 --> 01:02:19,493
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the internet.

1004
01:02:19,533 --> 01:02:20,433
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the radio.

1005
01:02:20,514 --> 01:02:21,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that okay?

1006
01:02:23,262 --> 01:02:26,576
[SPEAKER_02]: all right say hi what say hi to the listeners mommy

1007
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:28,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Mommy.

1008
01:02:30,573 --> 01:02:31,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Jamie.

1009
01:02:31,834 --> 01:02:33,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen you in a while, but hi.

1010
01:02:33,355 --> 01:02:33,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

1011
01:02:33,635 --> 01:02:35,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Now everybody at work is sick.

1012
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:53,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh

1013
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:22,781
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of it?

1014
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:23,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I knew.

1015
01:03:23,522 --> 01:03:24,302
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of it?

1016
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:27,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was good exercise.

1017
01:03:28,343 --> 01:03:29,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good exercise.

1018
01:03:29,503 --> 01:03:33,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I was probably never at my thinnest, or I was never thinner than I was when I played that, huh?

1019
01:03:33,264 --> 01:03:34,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Except when you had pancreatitis.

1020
01:03:34,665 --> 01:03:36,245
[SPEAKER_05]: That's absolutely true.

1021
01:03:37,585 --> 01:03:41,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I supposed to not like it or something?

1022
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:42,687
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1023
01:03:43,427 --> 01:03:44,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask you this.

1024
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:47,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there ever video games that I played growing up that you didn't like?

1025
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:50,669
[SPEAKER_05]: That I didn't like?

1026
01:03:50,749 --> 01:03:50,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1027
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:57,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't particularly fond of the very violent games.

1028
01:03:57,451 --> 01:04:02,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just don't think it's particularly good for children to be playing those kind of games.

1029
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:15,783
[SPEAKER_05]: War games and things like that.

1030
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:20,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever catch me playing a bad video game and you grounded me?

1031
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:21,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't really remember.

1032
01:04:21,351 --> 01:04:21,831
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1033
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:24,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remember you... No, because you had pretty good taste.

1034
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:26,437
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't really like those violent games.

1035
01:04:26,457 --> 01:04:27,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that's not true.

1036
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:29,702
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I was really good at hiding it from you.

1037
01:04:30,803 --> 01:04:31,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe so.

1038
01:04:31,823 --> 01:04:35,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I just... Never tell your mother how sneaky and devious you were as a child.

1039
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, she knows all about that stuff now because it's funny.

1040
01:04:38,706 --> 01:04:42,247
[SPEAKER_02]: My sister and I will get together and exchange stories with my mother sitting right there.

1041
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:49,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but the other thing... Do you remember a game called Mortal Kombat that I used to play?

1042
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't like that one.

1043
01:04:52,691 --> 01:04:53,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wasn't it gross?

1044
01:04:55,069 --> 01:04:55,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty gross.

1045
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:02,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was doing an impersonation earlier that you would come in the room and you would say, Rob, what is that game?

1046
01:05:02,634 --> 01:05:03,955
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a gross game.

1047
01:05:04,015 --> 01:05:04,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn off that game.

1048
01:05:04,676 --> 01:05:06,017
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gross.

1049
01:05:06,357 --> 01:05:07,718
[SPEAKER_05]: You were a little older then, too.

1050
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:08,378
[SPEAKER_05]: You weren't real.

1051
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you were like 14, maybe.

1052
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:12,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was okay.

1053
01:05:12,902 --> 01:05:14,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the point where it was okay.

1054
01:05:14,283 --> 01:05:15,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you weren't real.

1055
01:05:15,623 --> 01:05:16,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking 5, 6, 7, 8.

1056
01:05:17,925 --> 01:05:22,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't think that would be appropriate for a child that age.

1057
01:05:22,402 --> 01:05:24,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of taste, I guess.

1058
01:05:25,024 --> 01:05:28,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And for one thing, I'm not that well coordinated.

1059
01:05:28,327 --> 01:05:30,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably fail at it, you know, because

1060
01:05:49,306 --> 01:05:54,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you've been doing it ever since you were a little kid, so you're pretty well-coordinated.

1061
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:58,293
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as using the joystick and stuff, I'm not.

1062
01:05:59,034 --> 01:06:03,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd rather be entertained rather than trying to entertain myself like that.

1063
01:06:04,017 --> 01:06:04,278
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1064
01:06:04,518 --> 01:06:05,899
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not interested in getting a Wii?

1065
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:07,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to do Wii bowling?

1066
01:06:11,303 --> 01:06:13,324
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really.

1067
01:06:13,545 --> 01:06:13,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1068
01:06:14,452 --> 01:06:14,772
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1069
01:06:15,493 --> 01:06:15,813
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1070
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to give me a Wii?

1071
01:06:17,354 --> 01:06:18,834
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to give me a Wii?

1072
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:19,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want a Wii?

1073
01:06:19,535 --> 01:06:20,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you want for Christmas?

1074
01:06:22,036 --> 01:06:26,758
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but you acted like you were trying to get me to say, oh, yeah, I'd love to have a Wii so you could get me one.

1075
01:06:27,038 --> 01:06:27,719
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't use it.

1076
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:28,919
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm not going to get you one.

1077
01:06:28,939 --> 01:06:29,540
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't use it.

1078
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,480
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

1079
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,642
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I'd wear myself out and then I'd say never again.

1080
01:06:34,682 --> 01:06:34,922
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1081
01:06:35,683 --> 01:06:40,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you want to say to the listeners of our fine radio program, the five people?

1082
01:06:40,325 --> 01:06:42,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to ask them why they don't have something better to do.

1083
01:06:49,258 --> 01:06:49,839
[SPEAKER_02]: 10-15 on the East Coast

1084
01:07:11,147 --> 01:07:12,268
[SPEAKER_08]: My mom doesn't live on the East Coast.

1085
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:13,268
[SPEAKER_08]: She lives in Central Time.

1086
01:07:13,288 --> 01:07:13,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Central Time.

1087
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:14,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So 9-15.

1088
01:07:14,449 --> 01:07:14,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

1089
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:15,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Wake her up.

1090
01:07:15,569 --> 01:07:16,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here you go.

1091
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:17,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Punch in the number one.

1092
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:21,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Mobile.

1093
01:07:22,093 --> 01:07:22,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1094
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:24,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1095
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:31,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Easter with the family here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1096
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it did not like that number.

1097
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,060
[SPEAKER_02]: What did I do wrong?

1098
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Mom's phone number acts wonky sometimes.

1099
01:07:38,042 --> 01:07:39,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you show it to me one more time here?

1100
01:07:39,542 --> 01:07:40,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, give me a sec.

1101
01:07:40,263 --> 01:07:40,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1102
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:43,024
[SPEAKER_08]: The top one.

1103
01:07:46,974 --> 01:07:47,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go.

1104
01:07:48,759 --> 01:07:49,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it goes.

1105
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:49,581
[SPEAKER_02]: It's calling.

1106
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:50,683
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, it's all you.

1107
01:08:12,435 --> 01:08:13,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, Mom.

1108
01:08:14,837 --> 01:08:15,477
[SPEAKER_02]: She went to bed.

1109
01:08:15,517 --> 01:08:16,078
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in trouble.

1110
01:08:16,138 --> 01:08:16,378
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1111
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:18,700
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not sleeping.

1112
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:21,202
[SPEAKER_02]: She's out partying.

1113
01:08:21,642 --> 01:08:22,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's leave her a voicemail.

1114
01:08:22,823 --> 01:08:23,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1115
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:26,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is Kathy.

1116
01:08:26,646 --> 01:08:28,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry I can't take your call right now.

1117
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:29,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Please leave me a message.

1118
01:08:29,628 --> 01:08:30,749
[SPEAKER_05]: She's so adorable.

1119
01:08:34,252 --> 01:08:36,413
[SPEAKER_00]: At the tone, please record your message.

1120
01:08:36,974 --> 01:08:41,057
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options.

1121
01:08:42,472 --> 01:08:44,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi Mommy, it's your spawn.

1122
01:08:46,053 --> 01:08:46,873
[SPEAKER_08]: The female one.

1123
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:50,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Your voicemail is live on Orange Nolts Radio.

1124
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:52,554
[SPEAKER_08]: We were trying to call you because it was funny.

1125
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:56,715
[SPEAKER_08]: But you would have been an internet celebrity.

1126
01:08:56,835 --> 01:08:57,695
[SPEAKER_08]: But you missed your chance.

1127
01:08:57,735 --> 01:08:58,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry Mom.

1128
01:08:58,336 --> 01:08:59,696
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to ask you about video games.

1129
01:08:59,776 --> 01:09:00,216
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Rob.

1130
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,696
[SPEAKER_02]: The terrible influence they had on your child.

1131
01:09:03,237 --> 01:09:04,777
[SPEAKER_08]: So call back this number.

1132
01:09:05,598 --> 01:09:06,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it'll work.

1133
01:09:06,499 --> 01:09:07,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows up as like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1134
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:08,660
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll poo.

1135
01:09:08,921 --> 01:09:10,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Text Jamie and we'll call you back.

1136
01:09:10,702 --> 01:09:11,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you, Mom.

1137
01:09:11,663 --> 01:09:11,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1138
01:09:11,923 --> 01:09:12,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you, Mom.

1139
01:09:12,564 --> 01:09:13,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, Mom's voicemail.

1140
01:09:14,965 --> 01:09:15,346
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1141
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:19,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now we've successfully derailed the show three times over.

1142
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,270
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of fun.

1143
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:23,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, and we had a canine visitor.

1144
01:09:23,712 --> 01:09:27,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, and I'm not a big fan of big dogs, so that kind of scared the hell out of me, but thank you.

1145
01:09:27,695 --> 01:09:28,036
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1146
01:09:29,757 --> 01:09:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, I just turn around.

1147
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:31,478
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a dog in my life.

1148
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:35,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew, did you know I was bit by a dog when I was five years old?

1149
01:09:36,123 --> 01:09:37,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had issues with them ever since.

1150
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:40,005
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you said.

1151
01:09:40,425 --> 01:09:40,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1152
01:09:41,026 --> 01:09:42,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case the listeners don't know.

1153
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:44,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of big dogs.

1154
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:47,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how about video games?

1155
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:52,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I put up the picture of the very gay M&M's.

1156
01:09:58,237 --> 01:10:00,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars

1157
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:41,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So meaning that when you take the other M-rated titles, Dementium, The Ward, Resident Evil Deadly Silence, Touch the Dead, Core, Ultimate Mortal Kombat, and all these games, and you add them all up, it doesn't match what Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars has sold.

1158
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:48,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of interesting because Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, the sales overall, have tended to be considered a disappointment.

1159
01:10:49,676 --> 01:10:53,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And they even came out and said, you know, they were blaming it on piracy.

1160
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:59,582
[SPEAKER_02]: That the commercial performance of Chinatown Wars has certainly suffered at the hands of piracy was an earlier quote about that.

1161
01:11:00,203 --> 01:11:03,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's interesting because it just goes to show M-rated games are not selling on the DS.

1162
01:11:03,845 --> 01:11:05,846
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I kind of think, well, duh.

1163
01:11:06,587 --> 01:11:08,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Most DS owners are kids.

1164
01:11:09,129 --> 01:11:09,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, really.

1165
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:11,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, true story.

1166
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:13,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at Outback last night.

1167
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:14,552
[SPEAKER_02]: The table next to us.

1168
01:11:14,692 --> 01:11:16,573
[SPEAKER_02]: What does the little kid have that's waiting for his little...

1169
01:11:17,754 --> 01:11:23,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Little Joey, you know what they call the young kangaroo menu, the Joey menu, waiting for his little kid steak.

1170
01:11:23,457 --> 01:11:24,337
[SPEAKER_02]: He was playing a DS.

1171
01:11:25,017 --> 01:11:26,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Pokemon or something.

1172
01:11:27,539 --> 01:11:28,659
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pokemanses.

1173
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the DS is like most popular with kids, like tweens, if you will.

1174
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:38,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, the M-rated games are not going to sell that well because my mother would not have bought me that game when I was growing up.

1175
01:11:39,664 --> 01:11:41,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

1176
01:11:43,689 --> 01:11:44,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1177
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:48,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they just need to make some better games, but honestly, I just don't think the DS is the platform for an M-rated game.

1178
01:11:48,953 --> 01:11:49,733
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly kids.

1179
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:51,334
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1180
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:52,815
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what's up next?

1181
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:54,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Some stuff.

1182
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:58,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy IX, actually.

1183
01:11:59,012 --> 01:12:13,558
[SPEAKER_08]: They are planning on putting Final Fantasy IX on PSN, and it was confirmed by Yoichi Iwata that it would join Final Fantasy VII and VIII on the PS3.

1184
01:12:14,658 --> 01:12:16,599
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yay, all the VV you want.

1185
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:17,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why not?

1186
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free money.

1187
01:12:19,426 --> 01:12:24,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, for putting a nostalgic game that everybody knows and loves back on the PlayStation Network.

1188
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:27,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it was probably a Final Fantasy a lot of people skipped over.

1189
01:12:27,432 --> 01:12:29,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think IX sold quite as well as the other ones.

1190
01:12:29,173 --> 01:12:30,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play that much of it.

1191
01:12:30,795 --> 01:12:34,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I played more of IX than I did of VIII because I actually liked IX.

1192
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:36,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got past the first disc on IX.

1193
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't beat it, but I went pretty far in it.

1194
01:12:39,741 --> 01:12:40,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good game.

1195
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:47,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, that more traditional Final Fantasy as opposed to that cyberpunk kind of looking thing, and that was its big thing.

1196
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:52,103
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some Twitter topics?

1197
01:12:52,143 --> 01:13:00,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if we got Twitter topics tonight, but we're going to go ahead and take some Twitter topics now on our Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1198
01:13:00,349 --> 01:13:05,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm trying to load the Twitter right now.

1199
01:13:06,995 --> 01:13:09,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I'll be able to filter out all the tweets about Justin Bieber.

1200
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:17,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Saga confirms closure of internal Iron Man and Golden Axe developer Do you know where that Sega office was located?

1201
01:13:40,425 --> 01:13:57,729
[SPEAKER_02]: San Francisco oh yeah I've driven by there yeah a lot of us have it's right there off I-80 you can't miss it yeah Sega Studios San Francisco has been closed they were making the Iron Man movie tie-in games Golden Axe, Beast Rider unfortunately the rumors were going around and they closed it that one hits very close to home that's a bummer

1202
01:13:59,252 --> 01:14:03,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Sega was having a resurgence in popularity with Bayonetta.

1203
01:14:03,693 --> 01:14:07,014
[SPEAKER_02]: God, that game they showed, Resonance of Fate, was that what it was called?

1204
01:14:07,295 --> 01:14:07,875
[SPEAKER_02]: At PAX East?

1205
01:14:07,995 --> 01:14:09,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it looked pretty rad, I gotta say.

1206
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:14,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sega's having a renaissance, but I guess the Iron Man movie tie-in games are not exactly how to do it.

1207
01:14:15,976 --> 01:14:20,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's something I would spend the extra money on, but I think it's cool.

1208
01:14:20,618 --> 01:14:24,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's cool that the game's kind of coming to the US at all.

1209
01:14:44,787 --> 01:14:52,094
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, we just talked about how I think it was getting a limited edition in Japan, but I guess this whole, actually this giant collection is only like 50 bucks.

1210
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:52,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not bad.

1211
01:14:53,215 --> 01:15:01,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, can't say I'm a huge fan of it, so I don't know if I could justify spending that kind of money, but I think it's cool that it's even coming out at all.

1212
01:15:02,304 --> 01:15:02,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's neat.

1213
01:15:04,318 --> 01:15:05,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a friend of mine will get it and I can check it out.

1214
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:07,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1215
01:15:07,539 --> 01:15:12,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex P. Carson says, your OLR logo is my Xbox gamer picture.

1216
01:15:13,022 --> 01:15:13,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

1217
01:15:13,862 --> 01:15:19,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know, and it's been a long time, but you can actually search for what's called community gamer pics on Xbox Live.

1218
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:20,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're in the pack two.

1219
01:15:20,805 --> 01:15:22,065
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the all games radio pack.

1220
01:15:22,606 --> 01:15:23,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It has...

1221
01:15:23,706 --> 01:15:24,627
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1222
01:15:47,905 --> 01:15:49,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Evil Protagonist says, I don't have a topic.

1223
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:52,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to tell you all how much I look forward to listening each and every week.

1224
01:15:52,734 --> 01:15:53,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for all you do.

1225
01:15:53,536 --> 01:15:54,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, thank you.

1226
01:15:54,778 --> 01:15:57,563
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very nice and I apologize for this week's show because it's kind of shit.

1227
01:15:59,008 --> 01:16:02,730
[SPEAKER_02]: BlueSwim also says, Rob, your mom's burn on the OLR listeners was epic.

1228
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:03,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, that's where I get it.

1229
01:16:05,351 --> 01:16:09,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, Spazinator, our good buddy, asks a WTF question.

1230
01:16:09,453 --> 01:16:15,235
[SPEAKER_02]: If Major Nelson is the mouth of Microsoft, who is the asshole or appendix of Microsoft?

1231
01:16:15,855 --> 01:16:16,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that's a good one.

1232
01:16:16,636 --> 01:16:18,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's the asshole of Microsoft?

1233
01:16:19,717 --> 01:16:47,963
[SPEAKER_02]: um my best guess I mean I don't think there's anybody who's just like a straight up jerk that I can think of but definitely a lot of what comes out of Peter Molyneux's mouth is so that would be my best guess for you there it is ah Rob you know what I just got done typing what's that she'll cut a bitch for what it's a Kathy Griffin album oh isn't that a book or something

1234
01:16:50,127 --> 01:16:52,569
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think that it's one of our shows.

1235
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:53,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1236
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:58,093
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple more news stories for you guys, and we have the classic game of the week.

1237
01:16:58,133 --> 01:16:58,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeehaw.

1238
01:16:59,654 --> 01:17:03,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, speaking of which, well, this is kind of an asshole thing to do, but not really.

1239
01:17:03,777 --> 01:17:04,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I get why they're doing it.

1240
01:17:04,938 --> 01:17:08,760
[SPEAKER_02]: They are suing Datel over the TurboFire controller.

1241
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:13,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Wildfire is what it's called in the UK, which is where Datel is from.

1242
01:17:13,404 --> 01:17:17,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, they say, you know what, this looks a little bit too much like an Xbox 360 controller, and I gotta say...

1243
01:17:18,747 --> 01:17:28,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it definitely kind of looks like an Xbox 360 controller, but I kind of always thought the third-party controllers all resembled the original controllers somewhat.

1244
01:17:29,154 --> 01:17:38,000
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Microsoft is seeking monetary compensation and an injunction preventing the company from manufacturing any more of the devices.

1245
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:42,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Datel and Microsoft, they've been going back and forth for a little while.

1246
01:17:42,522 --> 01:17:46,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I would guess that this was not a licensed Microsoft peripheral and that's part of the problem.

1247
01:17:46,684 --> 01:17:51,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you might remember Datel, they made the memory cards that got the shaft from Microsoft.

1248
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:56,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's what this... This is just these two companies just kind of going back and forth at each other.

1249
01:17:57,669 --> 01:18:00,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bummer because maybe the D-pad on this thing would have been better.

1250
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:04,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And judging from the looks of it, it doesn't look so like a round D-pad.

1251
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:05,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have actually been a little better.

1252
01:18:06,511 --> 01:18:07,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a bummer.

1253
01:18:08,192 --> 01:18:09,212
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, you know what?

1254
01:18:09,872 --> 01:18:12,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, you know, they did make that controller and they patented it.

1255
01:18:12,973 --> 01:18:17,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you make something a little too close, that's why people get sued.

1256
01:18:17,675 --> 01:18:20,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when you're not already in the company's good favor.

1257
01:18:22,336 --> 01:18:22,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1258
01:18:22,836 --> 01:18:23,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony's gonna sue.

1259
01:18:24,456 --> 01:18:25,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loves to sue.

1260
01:18:25,957 --> 01:18:26,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura.

1261
01:18:28,878 --> 01:18:30,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could sue my face.

1262
01:18:32,343 --> 01:18:32,824
[SPEAKER_08]: What a quote.

1263
01:18:34,186 --> 01:18:40,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's an MMO that's called PokéNet that was a fan-run MMORPG based on Pokémon.

1264
01:18:41,536 --> 01:18:41,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

1265
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:50,088
[SPEAKER_08]: It was... Actually, Nintendo sent the request for them to shut it down at the end of March.

1266
01:18:51,209 --> 01:18:59,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And they postponed closing it, but they actually formally shut it down on April Fool's Day.

1267
01:19:00,915 --> 01:19:01,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And... And that's no joke.

1268
01:19:03,997 --> 01:19:08,523
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just a number of them that have been shut down, but this is just the newest one.

1269
01:19:08,623 --> 01:19:15,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they said, for the code that they created for the game, they're joking about using it for Digimon or Monster Ranger.

1270
01:19:17,014 --> 01:19:18,396
[SPEAKER_08]: But most of their devs are giving up.

1271
01:19:19,178 --> 01:19:21,179
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a funny little FU, I suppose.

1272
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,941
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bummer, but it's not a surprise.

1273
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:27,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon is one of Nintendo's most treasured MMOs.

1274
01:19:28,104 --> 01:19:32,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that these guys are just trying to make the game that everybody wants, which is the Pokemon MMO.

1275
01:19:33,007 --> 01:19:35,169
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what tons and tons of gamers everywhere want.

1276
01:19:35,209 --> 01:19:36,470
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about it on this show.

1277
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:41,053
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a great thing for the franchise, and for whatever reason, Nintendo is just refusing to do it.

1278
01:19:42,934 --> 01:19:46,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because of the fact that it's a kid-based game, and that would be very hard to keep safe and clean.

1279
01:19:47,237 --> 01:19:48,298
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably part of the reason.

1280
01:19:48,898 --> 01:20:02,832
[SPEAKER_02]: but I mean it's a bummer but I think Nintendo's within their rights certainly you know especially if it wasn't a quality product but I do think if the guys are that passionate about the product they should go back and make it a different type of monster

1281
01:20:03,615 --> 01:20:30,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that would take a lot of re-art and all that stuff and plus if it's too close to the Pokemon idea it might still get the smackdown but I mean Pokemon and Digimon can coexist and you know they're not that different I mean yes there's differences but they come down to little pocket monsters and collecting catch them all yada yada but Nintendo's done that a lot lately they shut down the Zelda project the movie thing remember that

1282
01:20:33,664 --> 01:20:34,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

1283
01:20:35,027 --> 01:20:35,649
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a right.

1284
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:41,723
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just go around making all this fake stuff because somebody out there is going to think it's real and that's where the real problems start.

1285
01:20:42,813 --> 01:20:48,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this was real, and this was licensed by Nintendo, and no matter what, Nintendo will never make this go away.

1286
01:20:49,056 --> 01:20:50,436
[SPEAKER_02]: The Super Mario Bros.

1287
01:20:50,476 --> 01:20:51,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Show!

1288
01:20:51,437 --> 01:21:03,261
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, the one with, rest in peace, Captain Lou Albano, starred as Mario, and of course, you know, they would do all these cute little live-action skits, and then they had the cartoons.

1289
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:08,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want to relive this from your childhood, or if you never got to experience this as a child to begin with, guess what?

1290
01:21:08,123 --> 01:21:08,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on Netflix!

1291
01:21:09,924 --> 01:21:11,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually go check this out.

1292
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:13,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it is on instant Netflix right now.

1293
01:21:13,266 --> 01:21:17,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go stream volume one of the collection and check out what you missed as a kid.

1294
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:20,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have either volume one or volume two.

1295
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:25,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one of the collections on DVD and it is so cheesy cheeserific.

1296
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:26,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.

1297
01:21:27,574 --> 01:21:30,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to give you a clue how amazing, here's a blast from the past.

1298
01:21:30,836 --> 01:21:31,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen up.

1299
01:21:32,628 --> 01:21:36,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Bizanos, it's the Mario Brothers Super Show!

1300
01:21:36,131 --> 01:21:38,133
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be hooked on the brothers.

1301
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:58,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you ever watch this show growing up, Jamie?

1302
01:21:58,835 --> 01:22:02,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, except I was really religious about watching Zelda on Friday.

1303
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:03,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.

1304
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:06,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, excuse me, princess.

1305
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that is a part of this because the Zelda collection's different.

1306
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Zelda was on a different DVD.

1307
01:22:16,043 --> 01:22:17,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if you can stream those yet.

1308
01:22:21,065 --> 01:22:22,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chatroom's bitching about the audio quality.

1309
01:22:23,006 --> 01:22:23,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, boo-hoo.

1310
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:37,943
[SPEAKER_02]: all right anyhow it's that part of the show where we really like to take a look back at classic gaming's history and pick one game to spotlight in a segment we call our classic game of the week

1311
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:46,471
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is going to dig through the gaming vaults, she's going to dive in head first, and she's going to sniff really loud, and whatever sticks to her nose first will be the game of the week.

1312
01:22:47,432 --> 01:22:50,774
[SPEAKER_02]: So DarkSakura, what did NosePond pick as the game of the week?

1313
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:55,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was Dan that picked the game, so you can blame him.

1314
01:22:56,077 --> 01:22:59,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a fabulous game you picked this week, so I thank Dan for this.

1315
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:04,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island.

1316
01:23:04,761 --> 01:23:07,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw yeah, one of the best ones in the whole damn series.

1317
01:23:07,972 --> 01:23:08,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Wee!

1318
01:23:08,813 --> 01:23:09,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Wee!

1319
01:23:09,773 --> 01:23:10,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Wee!

1320
01:23:10,814 --> 01:23:11,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Wee!

1321
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:12,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1322
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:20,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, you go around as Yoshi and you have baby Mario on your back.

1323
01:23:20,682 --> 01:23:21,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can play different Yoshis.

1324
01:23:24,845 --> 01:23:27,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be a prequel for Super Mario World, though.

1325
01:23:27,828 --> 01:23:28,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, by the story.

1326
01:23:29,469 --> 01:23:33,332
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, your life bar is your baby Mario when he falls off your back.

1327
01:23:33,773 --> 01:23:36,735
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go, he floats around in a little bubble and you have to go catch him.

1328
01:23:37,176 --> 01:23:42,180
[SPEAKER_08]: And he gives the single most annoying cry ever.

1329
01:23:46,524 --> 01:23:49,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, I think this game scared me away from children for a long time.

1330
01:23:51,005 --> 01:23:53,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... But, I mean, you go through.

1331
01:23:53,187 --> 01:23:56,831
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also, uh... Eating certain enemies give you certain colored eggs.

1332
01:23:56,871 --> 01:23:57,592
[SPEAKER_08]: You can throw them.

1333
01:23:57,632 --> 01:24:00,815
[SPEAKER_08]: You can eat certain enemies and shoot them just right back at themselves.

1334
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:05,379
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um... This is a pretty fun little game.

1335
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:05,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1336
01:24:07,701 --> 01:24:25,964
[SPEAKER_08]: and also if you get a perfect score in all 8 of the regular levels you'll get a secret level and there are 5 flowers that you can pick up in each stage and you have red coins and all kinds of fun stuff that you can find um

1337
01:24:29,674 --> 01:24:36,456
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, you have to go and get baby Luigi back from Magikoopa Comic.

1338
01:24:37,276 --> 01:24:41,397
[SPEAKER_08]: It also uses the Super FX 2 for sprite scaling and polygon effects.

1339
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:45,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And all kinds of stuff.

1340
01:24:47,719 --> 01:24:47,879
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1341
01:24:49,685 --> 01:25:15,793
[SPEAKER_08]: It was actually, the particular style for it, the rumor is that it came from an internal evaluation committee conflict with the Nintendo, and Miyamoto was instructed to use the Donkey Kong Country style of pre-rendered graphics, and so he altered them to look as if they had been drawn with crayons.

1342
01:25:18,846 --> 01:25:19,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1343
01:25:19,687 --> 01:25:21,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought this game kind of had a unique look to it.

1344
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:23,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool that that's where it came from.

1345
01:25:26,313 --> 01:25:26,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1346
01:25:26,813 --> 01:25:27,294
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it?

1347
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:31,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that actually was given the award for Best Game of 1995 by EGM.

1348
01:25:32,421 --> 01:25:32,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a great game.

1349
01:25:32,921 --> 01:25:40,925
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as sequels, though, we've had Yoshi Touch and Go and Yoshi's Universal Graviton for the Game Boy Advance.

1350
01:25:40,945 --> 01:25:41,665
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember Touch and Go.

1351
01:25:41,685 --> 01:25:44,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Yoshi's Story came out on Nintendo 64.

1352
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:48,829
[SPEAKER_08]: There was Yoshi's Island DS.

1353
01:25:49,949 --> 01:25:56,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Yoshi's Island was used in the SNES and Game Boy versions of Tetris Attack as a background game.

1354
01:25:58,288 --> 01:25:58,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this on the Wii?

1355
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:00,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it is.

1356
01:26:00,269 --> 01:26:00,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

1357
01:26:00,729 --> 01:26:01,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong.

1358
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the chatters will correct me if I'm wrong.

1359
01:26:03,231 --> 01:26:04,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it is on the Wii.

1360
01:26:05,071 --> 01:26:05,272
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1361
01:26:05,772 --> 01:26:06,452
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's it.

1362
01:26:06,552 --> 01:26:07,272
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Yoshi.

1363
01:26:07,813 --> 01:26:09,754
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also the game with Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy.

1364
01:26:10,014 --> 01:26:11,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was an amazing moment in gaming history.

1365
01:26:12,715 --> 01:26:16,097
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know what Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy is, I'm sure... It's got to be on YouTube somewhere, right?

1366
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:17,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell me it's on YouTube.

1367
01:26:17,497 --> 01:26:17,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1368
01:26:17,817 --> 01:26:18,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1369
01:26:18,478 --> 01:26:19,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Touch...

1370
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:21,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuzzy.

1371
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:22,270
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

1372
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:24,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't type today.

1373
01:26:24,631 --> 01:26:27,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sick and there's earthquakes and I can't type.

1374
01:26:27,732 --> 01:26:28,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go.

1375
01:26:28,652 --> 01:26:29,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Touch Fuzzy, get dizzy.

1376
01:26:29,853 --> 01:26:35,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the level that's hilarious because when you would touch these big fuzzy looking things, then your guy would just go psycho.

1377
01:26:35,475 --> 01:26:36,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.

1378
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:44,059
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I think this is like a speed run.

1379
01:26:44,099 --> 01:26:44,639
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this one?

1380
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:45,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Touch Fuzzy, get stoned.

1381
01:26:48,281 --> 01:26:48,821
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?

1382
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:52,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking people.

1383
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently someone put in clips of a Raiden DX.

1384
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:55,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

1385
01:26:56,443 --> 01:27:02,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that has everything to do with Super Mario Bros.

1386
01:27:02,626 --> 01:27:03,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Comments from our chat room.

1387
01:27:04,328 --> 01:27:07,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaoran says, that game, it kicked my ass.

1388
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:08,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not afraid to admit it.

1389
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:11,872
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw said, never played this game, but it seems like Nintendo always retconned the Mario games.

1390
01:27:11,912 --> 01:27:14,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mario and Luigi knew about the Mushroom Kingdom since they were toddlers.

1391
01:27:15,649 --> 01:27:16,631
[SPEAKER_07]: They were that young.

1392
01:27:16,891 --> 01:27:17,713
[SPEAKER_07]: They wouldn't have remembered it.

1393
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:21,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pops says, I thought it had some kind of new chip in it that they debuted with the game.

1394
01:27:21,619 --> 01:27:23,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was the FX2 chip, wasn't it?

1395
01:27:23,182 --> 01:27:24,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was the Super FX2.

1396
01:27:24,424 --> 01:27:24,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1397
01:27:26,022 --> 01:27:28,763
[SPEAKER_02]: It made it a bitch to emulate for a long time.

1398
01:27:28,783 --> 01:27:32,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that was one of the prized emulated games when it finally happened.

1399
01:27:32,984 --> 01:27:37,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, believe it or not, we're reaching the end of our show and the part where we're going to open up the Skype line to your calls.

1400
01:27:37,905 --> 01:27:40,826
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1401
01:27:41,206 --> 01:27:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: The phone lines are open.

1402
01:27:42,606 --> 01:27:43,507
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking calls right now.

1403
01:27:43,547 --> 01:27:47,508
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a short show tonight because as you can tell, we're a little bit sick and out of it tonight.

1404
01:27:47,608 --> 01:27:48,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1405
01:27:49,108 --> 01:27:49,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Benadryl

1406
01:28:11,294 --> 01:28:12,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, call us, people.

1407
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:18,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, Loki should be back, and hopefully he won't be sick.

1408
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:21,800
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll be fresh from my birthday beer potluck.

1409
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:23,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1410
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:24,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I'll be feeling better.

1411
01:28:24,242 --> 01:28:26,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having a beer potluck for my birthday.

1412
01:28:26,563 --> 01:28:27,183
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.

1413
01:28:27,924 --> 01:28:28,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coming.

1414
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:30,817
[SPEAKER_08]: So soon?

1415
01:28:31,797 --> 01:28:32,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

1416
01:28:32,138 --> 01:28:34,159
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what was something we ought to look into for the show, by the way?

1417
01:28:34,219 --> 01:28:43,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night at the show at Rocky, somebody had this app on their iPhone 3GS that was a Ustream app so you could actually stream video from your iPhone.

1418
01:28:44,425 --> 01:28:49,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might want to look into that for your phone to see if we can do webcam again with your iPhone.

1419
01:28:49,748 --> 01:28:51,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could be the camera woman on the show.

1420
01:28:51,249 --> 01:28:51,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1421
01:28:51,929 --> 01:28:52,670
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be fun.

1422
01:28:54,431 --> 01:28:54,811
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1423
01:28:56,973 --> 01:28:57,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Is no one calling in?

1424
01:28:59,929 --> 01:29:00,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's happening?

1425
01:29:02,031 --> 01:29:04,352
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to call in and share a story with us, you can.

1426
01:29:06,434 --> 01:29:06,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mind.

1427
01:29:08,275 --> 01:29:11,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Alpha Cananogram says I should leave a drunk voicemail from the beer potluck.

1428
01:29:11,758 --> 01:29:15,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably have to drive, so I don't think that'll be happening because I'm a good boy.

1429
01:29:17,702 --> 01:29:19,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Some callers are saying that they get the voicemail when they call.

1430
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:22,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, nothing is ringing through, so keep trying, folks.

1431
01:29:22,723 --> 01:29:26,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, DarkTetsuya is probably calling in trying to talk about WonderCon.

1432
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that happened this weekend, WonderCon?

1433
01:29:29,005 --> 01:29:32,886
[SPEAKER_02]: A big, big convention that happened in San Francisco over the weekend.

1434
01:29:33,346 --> 01:29:34,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a huge deal.

1435
01:29:36,448 --> 01:30:04,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like the second biggest comic book convention only next to Comic Con and yeah I was going on in San Francisco this weekend sadly I couldn't go I was in San Francisco but I'm still so sick and I was kind of conned out which is also bad you know what I'm gonna restart Skype just in case something is going wrong with the Skypey thing let me just quit quit quit I'm gonna quit and I'm gonna reboot Skype and we'll see if we get a call

1436
01:30:06,254 --> 01:30:09,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I have to log in because I don't ever save the password.

1437
01:30:11,576 --> 01:30:16,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is Easter, so it's a little bit slower of a night anyway, so we might not get a lot of calls.

1438
01:30:16,098 --> 01:30:17,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby apparently had no calls on his show.

1439
01:30:17,759 --> 01:30:18,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he had at least one.

1440
01:30:18,699 --> 01:30:21,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he had at least one.

1441
01:30:22,481 --> 01:30:26,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody said they were trying to call, but they got a busy signal, so I thought, okay, let's restart Skype and see what happens.

1442
01:30:27,203 --> 01:30:27,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my mom.

1443
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:29,023
[SPEAKER_02]: She did something.

1444
01:30:29,664 --> 01:30:32,905
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother, when she told all the listeners to go outside, basically.

1445
01:30:32,925 --> 01:30:33,745
[SPEAKER_02]: She grounded Skype.

1446
01:30:33,965 --> 01:30:34,265
[SPEAKER_02]: She did.

1447
01:30:34,325 --> 01:30:35,506
[SPEAKER_02]: She put Skype on timeout.

1448
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:37,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, um...

1449
01:31:06,997 --> 01:31:07,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1450
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:09,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably doing homework, really.

1451
01:31:10,119 --> 01:31:10,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1452
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-stop party for you, DarkSakura.

1453
01:31:15,821 --> 01:31:16,882
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you studying these days?

1454
01:31:16,902 --> 01:31:19,643
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to be when you grow up?

1455
01:31:20,964 --> 01:31:29,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully a designer, which I'm already doing now, but I'm working on a website for my Dreamweaver class.

1456
01:31:29,908 --> 01:31:30,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God, we're getting a call.

1457
01:31:31,609 --> 01:31:32,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lines Radio.

1458
01:31:32,669 --> 01:31:33,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1459
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:35,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Yar had his revenge.

1460
01:31:36,972 --> 01:31:37,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Yars Revenge

1461
01:32:01,936 --> 01:32:02,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Astro Smash.

1462
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:03,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

1463
01:32:03,698 --> 01:32:07,842
[SPEAKER_10]: And no, I've been playing Final Fantasy XIII as the real game, quote-unquote, that I've been playing.

1464
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:09,884
[SPEAKER_10]: How far are you into that game at this point?

1465
01:32:11,086 --> 01:32:16,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I am on Chapter 10, so if I was on the Xbox 360, I would have just put in Disc 3.

1466
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:19,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, you are way past me because I think I'm on, like, Chapter 9.

1467
01:32:21,776 --> 01:32:23,218
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best place to farm gill.

1468
01:32:23,258 --> 01:32:24,219
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the airship, right?

1469
01:32:24,899 --> 01:32:25,160
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1470
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:25,220
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1471
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:26,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no.

1472
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:27,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm way back then.

1473
01:32:27,841 --> 01:32:28,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like maybe chapter 7.

1474
01:32:29,182 --> 01:32:30,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in Palimporum.

1475
01:32:30,903 --> 01:32:33,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just... I got to Hope's dad.

1476
01:32:33,984 --> 01:32:35,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm not trying to spoil too much.

1477
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:36,265
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I quit.

1478
01:32:36,365 --> 01:32:38,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Hope's dad in the little emo scene with that and then I stopped.

1479
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:39,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Like right after that.

1480
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:41,288
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm at.

1481
01:32:41,808 --> 01:32:43,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Best place to farm money.

1482
01:32:44,874 --> 01:32:51,720
[SPEAKER_10]: All those soldiers drop those credit chips and incentive chips, and those give 500 gil and 2,500 gil each.

1483
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:52,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to remember that.

1484
01:32:53,581 --> 01:32:55,723
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm on the airship, I should farm a crap ton of gil.

1485
01:32:56,844 --> 01:32:57,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1486
01:32:57,165 --> 01:32:57,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Pro tip.

1487
01:32:57,885 --> 01:32:58,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

1488
01:32:58,426 --> 01:32:58,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Good tip.

1489
01:32:59,827 --> 01:33:02,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Any games that you're looking forward to that are coming out in the near future, Bobby?

1490
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1491
01:33:05,339 --> 01:33:05,680
[SPEAKER_10]: E3 this year?

1492
01:33:18,672 --> 01:33:19,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping to go to E3.

1493
01:33:19,893 --> 01:33:23,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I did finally get my tax return so I can finally start booking things.

1494
01:33:23,656 --> 01:33:29,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't go to PAX East because I decided buying a house was more important.

1495
01:33:29,361 --> 01:33:31,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Priorities.

1496
01:33:31,583 --> 01:33:34,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still a renter so I had that disposable income that you needed.

1497
01:33:36,767 --> 01:33:37,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to E3.

1498
01:33:37,828 --> 01:33:38,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making it happen.

1499
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:42,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys talked about the Blur beta at all?

1500
01:33:42,411 --> 01:33:43,432
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

1501
01:33:43,672 --> 01:33:44,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I have played it.

1502
01:33:44,693 --> 01:33:45,474
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to say about it?

1503
01:33:47,121 --> 01:33:54,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't figured out if it's insanely good or insanely bad yet.

1504
01:33:54,986 --> 01:33:55,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that?

1505
01:33:55,947 --> 01:33:57,007
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes the game insane?

1506
01:33:58,048 --> 01:34:00,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's Mario Kart meets Need for Speed.

1507
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:02,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is a great idea.

1508
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:03,031
[SPEAKER_10]: That's basically what the game is.

1509
01:34:04,031 --> 01:34:06,313
[SPEAKER_10]: And it depends on the map that you're playing.

1510
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:15,204
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's fair or not, if you're not extremely good at it or know all the sight lines and all that stuff.

1511
01:34:16,945 --> 01:34:20,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And what sucks is that I'm only good at one map and that's the one map nobody chooses.

1512
01:34:21,729 --> 01:34:23,070
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is fun.

1513
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:27,472
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually a game I don't mind playing with random people because I just don't listen to them.

1514
01:34:28,873 --> 01:34:29,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't either.

1515
01:34:29,334 --> 01:34:31,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't turn on my headset when I'm playing that game.

1516
01:34:32,456 --> 01:34:34,297
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you think you'll pick up the full version when it comes out?

1517
01:34:35,706 --> 01:34:40,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I will at least rent it because I want to see how the single player is.

1518
01:34:40,868 --> 01:34:42,408
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still looking forward to Split Second.

1519
01:34:42,988 --> 01:34:43,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1520
01:34:43,408 --> 01:34:50,911
[SPEAKER_10]: But what worries me about Split Second is that I don't want... Because I loved Full Auto.

1521
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,583
[SPEAKER_10]: because the demo I played at E3 was amazing.

1522
01:34:54,623 --> 01:34:55,244
[SPEAKER_10]: It was awesome.

1523
01:34:55,264 --> 01:34:55,664
[SPEAKER_10]: It was great.

1524
01:34:55,704 --> 01:34:57,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I got the game and I didn't like it all that much.

1525
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:59,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Loki did, but he's not there.

1526
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:07,498
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm afraid Split Second made an amazing demo and the rest of the game won't live up to it.

1527
01:35:07,818 --> 01:35:09,160
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm really afraid of that.

1528
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:17,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what's interesting is that they were parading split second around PAX East, and it looks like they brought the same damn booth to PAX East that they had at E3, although it was configured differently for the space.

1529
01:35:18,488 --> 01:35:20,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the same demo, too.

1530
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:25,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say that with 100% certainty because I don't remember that far back, but I think it was the same darn demo that we had at E3.

1531
01:35:26,676 --> 01:35:28,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting that this game is still not out.

1532
01:35:28,437 --> 01:35:32,520
[SPEAKER_10]: At the airport or something where the control tower's crashing around you and stuff?

1533
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it seemed like it.

1534
01:35:33,641 --> 01:35:36,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I honestly didn't really play it again.

1535
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:39,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched for a little bit, and it just seemed the same to me.

1536
01:35:39,325 --> 01:35:40,606
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like I was looking at the same thing.

1537
01:35:42,247 --> 01:35:46,971
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't pick out a lot of those little graphical things and things like that.

1538
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:51,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, imagine it has to be a newer version, but it was probably like the same stages or something.

1539
01:35:51,869 --> 01:36:20,830
[SPEAKER_10]: not really because I guess looking from a game developer point of view they're not going to spend too much more resources just to show kids at PAX East true because the PAX demo at PAX Prime was the same as the E3 demo so it's very possible that they just instead of spending the money making a new demo they're trying to get the game out in time because I think it's supposed to come out before E3 so they're not going to spend time making a new E3 demo no

1540
01:36:22,494 --> 01:36:29,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't see them for PAX East, unfortunately.

1541
01:36:29,621 --> 01:36:36,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't see them spending all that time making a new demo when they have a perfectly good one from E3 that is impressive.

1542
01:36:36,728 --> 01:36:37,189
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

1543
01:36:37,409 --> 01:36:41,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably a lot of people that were at that expo had never played it before because it was a totally different crowd.

1544
01:36:42,254 --> 01:36:42,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1545
01:36:43,973 --> 01:36:48,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Bobby, anything else on your mind before we try to go back and see if we get any other calls tonight?

1546
01:36:48,876 --> 01:36:49,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it'll just be you.

1547
01:36:49,956 --> 01:36:50,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1548
01:36:51,477 --> 01:36:51,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yar.

1549
01:36:52,358 --> 01:36:52,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Yar.

1550
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:54,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to work on that this week, Bobby.

1551
01:36:54,899 --> 01:37:00,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I told you on your show, I've never been better at Yar's Revenge of My Life until you inspired me to kick your butt.

1552
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:02,841
[SPEAKER_10]: and you haven't kicked it yet.

1553
01:37:02,921 --> 01:37:03,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying.

1554
01:37:04,062 --> 01:37:05,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I've one-upped you a couple times.

1555
01:37:05,422 --> 01:37:06,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made you work.

1556
01:37:06,683 --> 01:37:07,343
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to admit that.

1557
01:37:07,783 --> 01:37:08,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I made you work.

1558
01:37:09,224 --> 01:37:09,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you did.

1559
01:37:09,924 --> 01:37:10,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there you go.

1560
01:37:10,764 --> 01:37:13,365
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you bowed down and... Alright, shut up.

1561
01:37:14,226 --> 01:37:15,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody else call in.

1562
01:37:15,306 --> 01:37:16,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't make it just me.

1563
01:37:16,326 --> 01:37:17,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, have a good one, Bobby.

1564
01:37:17,887 --> 01:37:18,207
[SPEAKER_02]: See ya.

1565
01:37:18,948 --> 01:37:19,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we know it works.

1566
01:37:19,989 --> 01:37:20,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby got through.

1567
01:37:20,649 --> 01:37:21,710
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the Skype line works.

1568
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:22,370
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that much.

1569
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:23,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it calls out okay.

1570
01:37:23,651 --> 01:37:24,732
[SPEAKER_02]: We called my mommy earlier.

1571
01:37:24,752 --> 01:37:28,555
[SPEAKER_02]: 877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1572
01:37:29,055 --> 01:37:38,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to feel like really headachy so I don't know how much longer we can keep this show going but we're gonna try to get at least one more call in on our Skype line.

1573
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:56,717
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we're going to wrap up the show we will be back next week with an all new edition of Orange Lounge Radio of course same bat time, same bat channel I think I mentioned it a minute ago but I should make sure to plug this because after all we do steal the man's bandwidth every week our old putty putty, silly putty

1574
01:37:58,018 --> 01:38:03,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Our old buddy, Scott Rubin, who hosts, he's kind of the grand poobah, if you will, of All Games Radio.

1575
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:11,323
[SPEAKER_02]: He is starting his own little show, but it's actually a big show, at Appaday.tv, and he's reunited with Diane Miazota.

1576
01:38:11,363 --> 01:38:13,084
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like G4 back when they were cool.

1577
01:38:13,184 --> 01:38:13,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we're getting a call.

1578
01:38:15,284 --> 01:38:16,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1579
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:16,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1580
01:38:18,746 --> 01:38:19,766
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Henderson, man.

1581
01:38:19,866 --> 01:38:20,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hi, Henderson, man.

1582
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:21,547
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

1583
01:38:22,767 --> 01:38:23,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing all right.

1584
01:38:23,727 --> 01:38:24,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show.

1585
01:38:24,668 --> 01:38:24,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1586
01:38:25,868 --> 01:38:27,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've been a long-time listener.

1587
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:28,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I've probably listened for like the last two years.

1588
01:38:29,012 --> 01:38:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it was your show that introduced me to All Games Radio years ago.

1589
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:39,285
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I have my own live show on Saturdays on All Games.

1590
01:38:39,465 --> 01:38:40,066
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your show?

1591
01:38:41,455 --> 01:38:43,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Distributed Failure, we come on at 3 p.m.

1592
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:47,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific time on Saturdays.

1593
01:38:47,562 --> 01:38:48,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I have heard of that program.

1594
01:38:48,823 --> 01:38:49,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

1595
01:38:49,724 --> 01:38:51,246
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome.

1596
01:38:51,386 --> 01:38:53,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure Scott knows that.

1597
01:38:53,448 --> 01:38:53,828
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

1598
01:38:53,848 --> 01:38:57,312
[SPEAKER_04]: People have heard of us.

1599
01:38:57,332 --> 01:38:57,813
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1600
01:38:58,133 --> 01:38:59,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what is on your mind, my friend?

1601
01:39:00,055 --> 01:39:01,256
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we owe the phone call tonight?

1602
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:15,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say, you know, you guys look like you're having trouble with Skype, and I just wanted to call in and say hey, and tell you guys I'm a long-time listener, and I did finish Final Fantasy XIII, which I thought was decent, but I still think it's low on the totem pole of Final Fantasy games.

1603
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:17,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as low as VIII.

1604
01:39:17,531 --> 01:39:21,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I think VIII is the worst Final Fantasy game ever created.

1605
01:39:21,375 --> 01:39:23,597
[SPEAKER_04]: You and I can agree on at least one thing, that's for sure.

1606
01:39:25,999 --> 01:39:41,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather play I didn't care much for 7 either but I did love 9 I think 9 is one of the best at least it's the best one on the PS1 era I would rather level a character from 1 through 75 on Final Fantasy 11 than play 5 more minutes of Final Fantasy 8

1607
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:49,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I even bought the PSN version to try to go back and finish it because it's like one of the only ones I've never finished and I couldn't do it.

1608
01:39:49,852 --> 01:39:51,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I still couldn't get to our first disc.

1609
01:39:51,813 --> 01:40:03,119
[SPEAKER_04]: What made me mad originally when I played it is I got to a section of the game and it's kind of spoiler-ish but not really because basically... There's only a six month moratorium on spoilers and it's passed so spoil away.

1610
01:40:03,459 --> 01:40:24,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, your female character that's supposed to be your girlfriend in the game, I can't think of her name right now, but there's a section of the game where you go to a location because she gets taken, and when she gets taken, she's in this tower where all the enemies are level 1, and you're supposed to have a special summons or whatever that can raise the levels so you can gain levels.

1611
01:40:24,997 --> 01:40:31,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got stuck at a boss there and couldn't get past the boss because the boss was too tough, but I couldn't gain any levels because everything was like level 1.

1612
01:40:32,903 --> 01:40:39,765
[SPEAKER_04]: and I tried to leave and it wouldn't let you leave so I got stuck in this endless loop and I just eventually couldn't do anything so I just quit playing the game.

1613
01:40:39,825 --> 01:40:41,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid ass system in that game.

1614
01:40:41,366 --> 01:40:42,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a dumb ass system.

1615
01:40:42,746 --> 01:40:54,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean the whole weapon system was ridiculous where you had to go around finding these items to upgrade your weapon so basically every battle in that game ended up being oh I'll just summon this monster that takes forever to watch all of its animation.

1616
01:40:54,931 --> 01:40:56,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful story, though.

1617
01:40:56,493 --> 01:40:57,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this.

1618
01:40:57,055 --> 01:40:58,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy VIII had a great story.

1619
01:40:58,898 --> 01:41:00,742
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have just made it the movie, honestly.

1620
01:41:01,423 --> 01:41:02,505
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have just made it the movie.

1621
01:41:03,573 --> 01:41:10,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it did have a great story, but yeah, that was, the gameplay ruined that game so, so much.

1622
01:41:10,617 --> 01:41:21,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And I try to go back to it on PSP, and it actually looks decent on PSP, which is amazing because, you know, it is a PlayStation 1 game, but that smaller screen and everything being so compact, it does make the graphics stand out.

1623
01:41:21,383 --> 01:41:22,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it better.

1624
01:41:22,964 --> 01:41:25,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Yars' Revenge looks awesome on my LCD monitor.

1625
01:41:25,665 --> 01:41:32,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, there's just a certain, there's just something to it that we didn't have back in, you know, back in the day of gaming.

1626
01:41:32,549 --> 01:41:36,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been tempted to play that game because I remember playing that game when I was like five and six years old, dude.

1627
01:41:37,251 --> 01:41:41,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just remember you go in that little middle section and the bullets wouldn't hurt you and all that.

1628
01:41:41,852 --> 01:41:48,454
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, I picked up Adventure on there, but I haven't tried it yet.

1629
01:41:48,915 --> 01:41:51,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to pick it up because, you know, it's Adventure.

1630
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:56,237
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also picked up Crystal Castle, which is kind of hard to control on that.

1631
01:41:56,599 --> 01:42:00,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that game needs a trackball, not an analog stick.

1632
01:42:01,024 --> 01:42:03,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine that that... I haven't played that one yet, I'll be honest.

1633
01:42:03,827 --> 01:42:10,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of avoided it because I know it can't control that well, but I worry about the whole trackball versus analog stick.

1634
01:42:10,814 --> 01:42:15,318
[SPEAKER_02]: But Yars' Revenge, seriously, best five bucks I've spent on Xbox Live in the past six months.

1635
01:42:15,599 --> 01:42:15,759
Yeah.

1636
01:42:16,152 --> 01:42:16,372
[SPEAKER_04]: GameRoom

1637
01:42:36,747 --> 01:42:37,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Age

1638
01:43:04,147 --> 01:43:06,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you a bad enough dude to eat a cheeseburger with the mayor?

1639
01:43:08,392 --> 01:43:09,594
[SPEAKER_02]: The president.

1640
01:43:09,614 --> 01:43:11,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the mayor was final fight.

1641
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:12,938
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, though.

1642
01:43:13,676 --> 01:43:20,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that'll get a lot of eyes back on Game Room, but hopefully they get all their stinking server problems figured out by that point.

1643
01:43:21,444 --> 01:43:24,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, did you happen to see that Data East collection that came out on Wii?

1644
01:43:24,787 --> 01:43:25,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's came out yet or not.

1645
01:43:25,888 --> 01:43:30,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got BurgerTime and Bad Dudes on there, so that's why I'm kind of hoping it'll come to Game Room.

1646
01:43:30,312 --> 01:43:30,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.

1647
01:43:33,575 --> 01:43:37,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played it myself, but I believe it has the sequel to BurgerTime as well.

1648
01:43:39,716 --> 01:43:40,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I love me some BurgerTime.

1649
01:43:40,676 --> 01:43:41,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been tempted to try to find that.

1650
01:43:43,979 --> 01:43:45,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like a pretty good deal.

1651
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played it myself, but it'll be pretty cool.

1652
01:43:48,201 --> 01:43:52,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, DarkTetsu's reminding me in chat, NARC is M-rated anyway, so it can't come to Game Room.

1653
01:43:52,644 --> 01:43:53,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.

1654
01:43:53,665 --> 01:43:54,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Technicality.

1655
01:43:55,266 --> 01:43:56,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Just turn the blood into sweat.

1656
01:43:56,627 --> 01:43:58,088
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they did back in my day.

1657
01:43:58,408 --> 01:44:01,170
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Henderson, man, we're going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call.

1658
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:02,391
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks so much for the call.

1659
01:44:02,551 --> 01:44:06,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And distributed failure... Distributed fail... I'm sick.

1660
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:07,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Distributed... Distributed failure.

1661
01:44:07,694 --> 01:44:08,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Failure.

1662
01:44:09,155 --> 01:44:09,996
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

1663
01:44:31,695 --> 01:44:37,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I said you can find the archives at distributedfailure.com so if anybody wants to listen and check it out, it's there.

1664
01:44:37,665 --> 01:44:39,147
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're live on Saturdays.

1665
01:44:39,468 --> 01:44:40,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Best of luck with your show, sir.

1666
01:44:42,172 --> 01:44:42,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

1667
01:44:42,913 --> 01:44:43,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, guys.

1668
01:44:43,714 --> 01:44:45,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the crew at Distributed Failure we all said hey.

1669
01:44:47,361 --> 01:44:48,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and bye, Jamie.

1670
01:44:48,701 --> 01:44:49,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1671
01:44:49,022 --> 01:44:49,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1672
01:44:50,862 --> 01:44:51,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1673
01:44:52,563 --> 01:44:53,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, sniffle sniffle.

1674
01:44:53,323 --> 01:44:54,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to get at least one more call in.

1675
01:44:55,044 --> 01:44:55,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1676
01:44:55,384 --> 01:44:56,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Something seems to be borked with the phone.

1677
01:44:57,004 --> 01:44:59,485
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual phone people, I think, are having problems tonight.

1678
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:00,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

1679
01:45:01,146 --> 01:45:02,426
[SPEAKER_02]: You all heard me call my mother.

1680
01:45:03,686 --> 01:45:04,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed to be working fine.

1681
01:45:05,327 --> 01:45:06,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know what's up.

1682
01:45:07,088 --> 01:45:08,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Your guess is as good as mine.

1683
01:45:10,097 --> 01:45:22,006
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give it just a couple more minutes for a call to come in, and if it doesn't come in, then I'll just chalk up the phone's not working to just yet another thing going wrong today between the earthquakes and the rainstorm and the plague.

1684
01:45:22,446 --> 01:45:23,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think Zombie Jesus did it?

1685
01:45:24,788 --> 01:45:26,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Ranma's trying to call in.

1686
01:45:26,569 --> 01:45:27,830
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya's trying to call in.

1687
01:45:28,290 --> 01:45:29,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Spazinator on Twitter said he was going to call in.

1688
01:45:30,011 --> 01:45:31,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Something appears to be wrong with the phone line itself.

1689
01:45:31,793 --> 01:45:32,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

1690
01:45:32,473 --> 01:45:32,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, watch.

1691
01:45:32,893 --> 01:45:36,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet if I call... Like, I don't know.

1692
01:45:39,475 --> 01:45:43,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch, I'm going to call my cell right now.

1693
01:45:47,685 --> 01:45:48,285
[SPEAKER_02]: It's calling.

1694
01:45:51,129 --> 01:45:51,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And there, my phone's ringing.

1695
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:53,440
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

1696
01:45:53,881 --> 01:45:55,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It's working.

1697
01:45:56,143 --> 01:45:56,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1698
01:45:56,544 --> 01:45:58,326
[SPEAKER_02]: The phone's stupid.

1699
01:45:59,967 --> 01:46:00,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the earthquakes.

1700
01:46:01,409 --> 01:46:02,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's blame it on the earthquakes.

1701
01:46:04,632 --> 01:46:05,013
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1702
01:46:05,093 --> 01:46:06,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sorry, guys.

1703
01:46:06,975 --> 01:46:07,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to do.

1704
01:46:07,656 --> 01:46:13,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we're just going to have to close up shop for the night and blame the earthquakes for taking down Skype tonight.

1705
01:46:15,049 --> 01:46:42,300
[SPEAKER_02]: you can always leave voicemails send us emails as well mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com I know DarkSakura probably wanted to call in to talk about WonderCon but he also did a fabulous write up that's available on the site orangeloungeradio.com if you want to read that he has a whole little wrap up on WonderCon hopefully we'll get some of these people in next week I'm sure Ranma wanted to call in to talk about Anime Boston I know he was there but sadly Skype got earthquakeed or something I don't know what's going on

1706
01:46:42,922 --> 01:46:44,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaoran in chat says, blame it on the rain.

1707
01:46:44,793 --> 01:46:45,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

1708
01:46:45,731 --> 01:46:51,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Blame it on the rain Blame it on the rain Blame it on the rain

1709
01:47:14,444 --> 01:47:17,465
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, thanks for being here and sticking it out through the show.

1710
01:47:17,706 --> 01:47:18,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I live here.

1711
01:47:18,486 --> 01:47:18,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1712
01:47:18,786 --> 01:47:19,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a final thought tonight?

1713
01:47:21,787 --> 01:47:22,868
[SPEAKER_08]: My Ben Angel's kind of working.

1714
01:47:24,109 --> 01:47:28,751
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is Mucinex is my friend, and I'm going to go take some more right now.

1715
01:47:29,211 --> 01:47:30,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great night, everybody.

1716
01:47:30,351 --> 01:47:35,014
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next week with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio that won't be so broken.

1717
01:47:35,274 --> 01:47:37,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a plan in case of an earthquake.

1718
01:47:38,075 --> 01:47:38,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1719
01:47:39,296 --> 01:47:39,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1720
01:47:39,716 --> 01:47:42,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Over this next week, have your earthquake plan prepared.

1721
01:47:42,617 --> 01:47:42,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night!

1722
01:48:09,498 --> 01:48:11,523
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're probably right anyway.

1723
01:48:12,104 --> 01:48:12,946
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week!
