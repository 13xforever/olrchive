Orange Lounge Radio
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and the Low Crew
Tonight at the 25th of 2010, could a new TV station come to an Xbox near you?
Some big Wii titles get delayed, and a Capcom press event confirms all that was spoiled last week
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends all across the internet and welcome to another episode, episode 364 of Orange Lounge Radio
It's the video game program where every gamer has a voice
Pull up a chair and join us and chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening
April the 25th of 2010, right after Bobby Blackwolf has finished his show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours
Say hello as well to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
Grapes
How are you doing?
Grapes
Full of grapes?
Muscat grapes
Did they taste grape?
Oh, we got three hours full of puns for you guys, I bet you can't wait
I heard worse over the weekend
Alright, and Loki, Techmaster Loki's in the house
Yes I am
How are you doing?
I'm doing okay
Now, Techmaster Loki, brought to the show with him tonight from KFC, Double Down number 2
Yes, this time without the horrible cheese sauce
And it still had kind of that little taste of the cheese sauce on there but
It was alright, it was definitely edible this time
And I just have to say it's kind of just average, really for the cost you're better off getting pretty much anything else
Even stuff from KFC, because I mean Double Down's like a good, I think $6.99 or something
I mean, hell, you can get a lot more chicken for that
Just get a chicken wing
Or just get wings
Just get a chicken wing
Just keep it old school
Barbeque wings or something like that, that's really where it's at, it's good stuff
Don't need the rest of the Double Down, it's just really just an excuse to sell expensive chicken
That's all it really is
But yeah, tried it with extra bacon even
And just, it's kind of okay
Even extra bacon didn't make it better?
Didn't really make it that, didn't make a difference really
Because it was just too much of the white meat chicken flavor
Alright, going to our chat room at chat.orangelandre.com
You know we call them the always present fourth guest on the show
Because we don't have any special guests tonight
We haven't had a lot of special guests at Studio Dark Soccer, I don't know what it is
The people I invented to were outside in the front yard racing RC cars
Or they were
Is that what they're really doing?
Yes
That's funny
And chasing
I only saw the girls across the street in the Barbie car
That I almost ran over
That was while, when you were just here and sitting here wondering what to do
Yes
They were outside actually chasing the dog with the RC cars
Will's dog won too
I see
And just to bring some light to what Dark Soccer said while you were sitting here wondering what to do
Usually I get to the show about an hour early, right?
I get here to the show because you know I want to set everything up
Get the mixing board, the mics, the chairs, the computer
Make sure we're ready for Bobby's call because he actually calls us about 5.45, 5.50
You know make sure everything's good to go
So that we're ready for showtime
But tonight I arrived and Dark Soccer had been proactive tonight
She had already set up the mixing board, plugged it in, had the mics
Everything was ready to go, I just had to turn on the computer
Except for Loki's mic because you forgot
Well that was my fault but that's neither here nor there
And I had gifts
Yes and she even gave me, what is this, like sweet beer or something, soda beer
Shandy, it's a Shandy Bass
Dark Soccer's trying to get me drunk
It's beer soda
I don't know why she's trying to get me drunk
It's a little too sweet overall but it's really good because it tastes just like
It's basically like a lemon soda with a little bit of beer in it
Alright, I know we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks
But there's some actually really funny personal things I think we have to talk about
And Dark Soccer, this cracked me up
Something that you have recently added to YouTube
Give us some background on what's going on here and what happened this past week
Well, I went to my friend Becky's son's third birthday party
Well okay, first of all, first of all that morning I went to a bar mitzvah
I hadn't eaten anything so I won't even go into that
So I went to Becky's son's birthday party
And he was really cute and he was wearing like the best shirt ever
Which was a t-shirt with a Dalek on it
So I actually managed to get some commentary from him
And I love this YouTube more than anything
What?
The first thing it got cut off is I asked him what was on his shirt
Oh okay, so, hey kid, what is on your shirt?
Dalek
What does a Dalek say?
It's a serendipity
And my immediate reaction was, Dark Soccer, what are you teaching the children?
I didn't teach him that
It wasn't me, I didn't do it
It was either his mother or his aunt or some relative along that vein
And if you want the chat room shouting link, link
But I want to give this out so that everybody has it
It's just on Dark Soccer's personal YouTube which you've given up
Dark Soccer O-L-R
Yeah, just YouTube, what, YouTube.com slash user slash Dark Soccer O-L-R
One word
So there you go, exterminate
Play it again, play it again, play it again
One more time, one more time
Exterminate
It's not as scary when he says it
It's really not
I also like how you said Dalek
Alright
Dalek
I hope you had fun, that's going to be the next David goes to the dentist video right there
Exterminate
Alright we have breaking
Becky, because I'm chatting with Becky, she said that he watched Doctor Who with them and seen a Dalek episode
I see
So he knows what a Dalek is
Alright, well we got some other breaking news, live unfolding, breaking news here at the O-L-R studio headquarters
We go live over to Tech Master Loki with the special report here
What is going on, this is unfolding live actually, literally
One minute before we went live tonight, we've found something out, what is going on, Loki?
Apparently one of Jamie's friends messaged me on Facebook
By the name TJ McKimy
And posted a link to a Stockton Craigslist entry
Guess whose number happens up here, right there
Oh, the guy that stole my 360 a while back
Off loady, PS3 now
And your money
Yes, and my money
So the guy who hack soared your 360 for real and just ran off with it and never
And if you didn't hear the show about a month ago, long story short, you went out to meet the guy
And he was going to do the J-Tag thing on your 360 so you could play as Baluta and all that stuff and no more heroes and stuff, right?
So he was going to do that to your 360 and he said, you know, come back in a couple hours
Which should have been your hint right there, Loki, but you know, you don't know until it happens
And so Loki tried to go back and yeah, the guy ran off with his 360
And that's why a super nice listener in Austin, we suspect, based on where the package came from
Apparently sent Loki a new one
So you think we'd be over this by now, but thanks to Super Sleuth TJ on Facebook
Apparently this guy is at it again on Craigslist
Oh yeah
I think I want to nail him
I know, and the chatters are going, call him, call him live on air
I am not radio professionally
I think there's an issue with doing that when you don't have the person's permission
I realize he's the bad guy, but I worry it would turn into one of those things where the thief falls through the roof
And then sues the owners of the home for the fact that he broke his foot trying to break into the house
You know what I mean?
So I can't do anything about it
But
As we look to the person who can do something about it
Or, well, I'm just saying
I don't want to drive down the Stockton again, I mean, it's Stockton, it's just, it's awful
You have, you have, we, hey, we don't write the news, we just report it
I say just call Stockton PD and
It would be funny, but, I mean, what are they going to do?
They're going to be like, well, it's our word versus yours
Uh, yeah, I was trying to illegally hack my 360
Well, not even, it doesn't even matter if that was the case
I was having solder work done on my, you know, 360s motherboard
Alright, and Bobby in chat, you know, because he knows more about radio than I do
So that's a, it depends on the states guy
Some states only need one side's permission
You know, again, it's just one of those things where it's like, you know what, it's
What about calling Disneyland?
I don't think it would be good
Remember when they called Disneyland?
That was harmless, that was funny
This will be funny too
And then the call got disconnected right in the middle
Dark Saga is referring to an old ass episode
A ten year old episode of Understation Live
That was great
Where we called the pay phone at Disneyland
That's how you know it's old
Because, are there even pay phones at Disneyland anymore?
I know, right
We called the pay phone at Disneyland and started having a conversation with some guy
And like right in the middle of it, the call just dropped
And we're like, oh shit, the Disneyland mafia
Just like tapped into the conversation and just terminated the call right there
Exterminate!
Alright
And then, oh apparently now, on top of everything else
Chatters are saying the stream is down
See?
Something is going
No, we're back
I know it's back, I'm looking at the little broadcasty thingy
And it says it's still sending data over
Well we still gotta tape the show
Because remember, I know live listeners
We love you guys, but we love the podcasters too
And the podcast people, they don't get the stream downtime
So we just gotta keep on rolling
I don't know what happened there, that's very odd
Xbox guys hacking our network too
Alright, let's get around ten minutes into the show finally
And we can finally talk about our gaming week
Stark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
It was not
Oh yeah, I started playing Babylonian Twins
Now that I finally have gotten my project out of the way
And had a chance to play something
It's really fun, oh my god it's really fun
But it's definitely, it's like a puzzle adventure game
It really is, because like you do one thing with one brother
And then the other one is a statue
So you actually can use him, when one's a statue
You can jump off of him and put him on buttons and levers and things
So it's just, it's really, really fun
This is the best way I can say it, it's just really fun
And I've gotten through like the first
I got through the tutorial level just playing around
And now I'm actually doing one of the levels for real
You know, like I said, I've really been busy doing a lot of other projects
But this is, it's really fun, it's a fun little game
And once I play more I'm actually going to do a little write up on it
Oh my gosh, our website might actually get some content outside of the
Lovely, and don't get me wrong, I love the I love that song
But that's about the only new content our website gets besides show updates
So that would be great, I'd love that
What?
New content for the site, it'd be great
Oh yeah
I mean, you know, we have the I love that song, that's it
You know, we get it, people love music
My brain was still on the game, so I was like, what?
Oh, that, yeah
See, I'd already forgotten about it
Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was okay, just, you know, playing Grand Theft Auto at work
And that was fun, and then
Let's see, this weekend I played through some of Just Cause 2
Just the beginning, because I have a version of the game
That has some of the PC mods on it
So that was kind of fun to play around with
Although, I don't think I ripped it right because
A lot of the textures weren't appearing, so it was kind of hard to play
But it was fun nonetheless, so I re-ripped it
And hopefully it'll work this time
And then of course, more Escaluda 2
This time I went through the Black Label Novice
And that was fun
I'll probably play through the rest of the game later on
Just kind of go in one version of the game at a time
And...
What else did I play?
I don't think I played in Final Fantasy 13
So yeah, I think that's about it, unfortunately
I gotta be honest, my gaming week this week was not really that action-packed
I really didn't play anything but WoW
I had a very Jamie week this week, actually
Nothing but Star Trek Online, except for playing Star Trek Online with WoW
Oh, I did play Star Trek Online last night, sorry
Oh my bad, well that's just a given
Well no, I hadn't touched it for a while, but I did play it last night
I will say this though, obviously I've been going through personal stuff with the job change
It's not a boo-hoo for me, well actually it's a good thing
But it just takes away from the gaming schedule
I will say this, on the Warcraft front I actually did accomplish quite a bit
I actually got one of my new characters, my warrior that I've been leveling with Alan
We got those together to Northrend, which is a big event
We're in the new content, the Wrath of the Lich King
But I will also say this, for the first time finally this week
I know, I'm a little late, I'm not much of a raider usually
I usually run the raids a lot, and WoW I used to about a year ago, but I don't really do it anymore
But this week, just randomly got asked to go, I went
I ran Icecrown Citadel, the new, well newish, it's not that new anymore for a WoW player
But a couple months old raid, that's basically the end game right now
The Lich King is the boss of Icecrown Citadel at the very very end
I was there for a couple hours, we got to the gunship battle
I had to go because I had other commitments
But we fought the first two bosses, it was cool
So I can finally say I've seen the inside of Icecrown Citadel, woo!
I need to run it again though, because you get reputation just for killing monsters in there
You can get cool rings, and stuff
So, that was it, I had a pretty Warcraft wonderful week
I will try to get back into some of the consoles this week
I know there's some stuff for Game Room coming out, we'll get to later in the show
That I definitely want to get around to
Although something that somehow missed the show role, so I'll bring it up now
I heard there were layoffs at Chrome this week
Apparently the Chrome studio in Australia had some big layoffs
And didn't they make Game Room?
So, are we screwed?
Probably not
They have the emulation already set, it's just putting a ROM with an emulator in place
Probably not even that, just putting a ROM in place
Well they do other games too though right?
Yeah they do other stuff
So maybe this just impacts the other stuff
Because I was reading it had nothing to do with Game Room
Even though Game Room kind of met with a reception
But that it was more the fact that they didn't get the rights to some Wii game they were going to do
Based on, I don't remember now
Somebody in chat will correct me
But there was some game they were supposed to do
I think it was like a movie tie-in or a sequel or something on the Wii
That they didn't end up getting to do and that kind of hurt them
Isn't it always a movie tie-in or sequel on the Wii?
Yeah
So
Alright
Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week and for my extra little news story I was throwing in there
See I'm starting the news before we even started the news
Housekeeping tonight, not a lot of show notes
I believe we're still here every week for the foreseeable future
Although I will say our anniversary show is creeping up on us
And our anniversary show is going to be the 27th I think of June?
I don't know, it'll be the 27th of June
Will be our what, 8 year anniversary show?
Jeez
I know right?
So that's in about 8 weeks
And Memorial Day is coming up
I think we're still all here for Memorial Day
I don't think, is anyone going out of town for Memorial Day?
No
And we still have a show on Memorial Day
Alright
No Fonomy this year again
I might be going actually
Are you going to go?
I don't know, it depends
I'd like to go and just kind of drop in
But we keep forgetting to like, oh yeah we should like try to get a panel
But that's got to be set in stone by now so we missed out on that one
Maybe go just to say hey, we'll see
Alright um
Not that many people come and see us at panels anyways
I've had fun
It's always fun
I don't know
More people came out of Fonomy than some of the other places I've gone
To do panels
Well sometimes when you have panels at 7 in the morning
It's kind of difficult to get a crowd
Hey that was fun
That one kid who showed up had a good time
It's like what the hell are we doing here, seriously
Alright
Why'd I wake up early for this?
Did you see that I've done a little bit of cleaning in here, a little bit?
A little bit
So I've started the
Your bookshelf looks a lot nicer than it used to
Massive task
It really does
I've been starting the massive task of organizing this room
Alright
I'm putting pictures on the thing
Ray Ayanami in chat says there aren't any OLR fans at Fonomy anyway
There's a few, there's the one guy who every year we're there
Asked Loki some mat question
Like why are you such a Mac hater?
There's some kid every year
Cause of you
That should be your response next year
Alright
Because of stupid design decisions
Like for example iTunes doesn't work with Windows XP 64 bit
For no reason whatsoever other than we want to be douchebag
Wait, Windows 7 64 bit? Yes it does
No, Windows XP 64 bit
No it does not
No it does not
Trust me
I have experience
It will not let you install it
Wait, there's an XP 64 bit?
I didn't even know that
I know there's Windows 7 64 bit
That's what I run now
But, alright
It does not support it for no reason other than Mac is retarded
Um, yeah you're not a designer so
Alright, can we please get onto gaming news
And not the PC Mac wars again
Jesus
I put up the pictures on my bookshelf since it's awesome
Gaming news, Loki
Um, there is a rumor
Coming from Bloomberg
That apparently
An ex-News Corp president
Peter Churman
Was engaged in talks
Or I guess is currently engaged in talks
With Microsoft to possibly launch
An Xbox Live television channel
Now this isn't necessarily gonna be a channel
That we see on TV
Focused around the Xbox
It's actually gonna be something that's gonna appear
On Xbox Live
Apparently
During an April 12th meeting
At Microsoft's
Reverend Washington office
Churman proposed a channel
Native to the Xbox 360
That would feature reruns and original shows
For an additional
One to two dollars
Per month on top of the standard
Xbox Live subscription fee
And
So it's basically
Peter is talking to lots of people
About lots of ideas in the digital space
And of course
Microsoft is not commenting
On it but it kind of
Fits with the rumor
That we had last week that apparently
Conan was in talks
With
Possibly Microsoft for doing his show
On Xbox Live
It's kind of interesting
Um
Who's to say this is off the table?
I don't think it is
I don't think it is either
I think this isn't so much a rumor about
What would have been
I think this is a rumor about what's going to come
I think maybe the fact that Conan
Didn't go to Xbox maybe
Slowed it down
But not that much
You know what I mean? Well it's very risky
What were the realistic chances of Conan going to Xbox Live anyway?
It's very risky
Being that it's not established yet
You don't know what kind of benefits and stuff
And if the whole thing flopped
It would be a wasted opportunity
So it's a more safe
More safe bet for him to go to
TBS
But if
If Netflix
And all that works on Xbox
Then why can't
This
I think this would be a good idea
Just depends on the amount of content
That's on here because a lot of people nowadays
With cable and satellite bills
Are higher and higher
If this is only going to be
The equivalent of possibly $12 to $24
A year
And the content's good
A lot of people would probably jump on that
I know I would if it's got
Some good shows on there
And even just shows that are on normal
Cable TV or something like that
I'd be all for that
Wouldn't that be ironic though
If you were getting your
Television through cable
And getting your TV through
Because your Xbox is actually your cable provider
Well thanks to the FCC
And Comcast
And stuff like that I'm sure that
Since now
They're trying to
Not pass the net neutrality
Those laws and stuff
That they'll be able to
Filter it out
Oh Comcast, you want to get TV through our cable internet?
No, I'm sorry
That's not going to happen
I think something's going to happen
Where that's going to
The minute those little loopholes get exposed
That stuff's going to get revoked
Playing quickly
But hopefully it's not just wishful thinking
I'll be really sad
But maybe it'll go a long way
In trying to get some competitors to Comcast
Like people will come back to them?
I don't think so
As far as the Xbox
Channel goes though
I remember last week we kind of had a discussion
With the PlayStation tester and all that stuff
And you said something like you didn't really want to watch the tester
Because you thought it was going to be a big commercial for Sony
Well wouldn't an Xbox network
Be a big commercial for Microsoft or
It all depends on what content's on there
Here's the thing
The tester
Where the prize is
Becoming a Sony PlayStation tester
Come on
I mean of course it's going to be focusing
On a lot of the games that Sony has
And people are like, oh my god I'm so excited to play the next
Big Sony game coming out
That's retarded
And yes if there was something like that on the Xbox
TV channel
I wouldn't want to watch it either because it would just be a waste of my time
It would still be a damn commercial for something
Now if they had something that was
Mainstream
Like something that's on TV for example
That might be
That's different
If they had episodes of The Office or something like that
Playing on there
Just whatever
You know what I mean?
Well I don't have Netflix
Oh okay I guess you got me there
But Netflix is so cheap
Is it a dollar a month cheap?
No not that cheap
Alright
But you'd have to pay for this TV thing too right?
Isn't that what they were talking about?
Yeah like an extra dollar or two a month
That's what they're looking to charge
I guess that's not that bad
Would I have to pay that Microsoft phony points?
I don't think so, probably not
It's interesting if it wouldn't be just
Cause you know we talk about Xbox, Xbox, Xbox
But why wouldn't
I mean if Microsoft's gonna launch a TV station
Why wouldn't it be available on your computer?
Why wouldn't it be available on your
Windows mobile phone?
Something to compete with the iPhone
I would think that
An Xbox network is not really an
Xbox network, it's a
Microsoft network
Well doesn't
I mean they have MSNBC
Maybe streaming stuff from that I don't know
I think
The MSNBC agreement's a little funky
I think it's a little more NBC than it is
MS at this point but I don't know
I don't know the ins and outs of how all that works
I guess I should stop trying to sound like an expert
Move on to another story
Let's talk about the PlayStation 3
Since we've had a little bit of Xbox news
And talk about PlayStation 3
And there is some feathers
Being ruffled on the PlayStation 3 this week
And it has to do with the game
Fight Double Impact or as I call it
Magic Sword Double Impact
You see what's happened
Is that this game will just
Not run unless you are signed
In online on your PlayStation Network
Account if you try to load the game
And you're not signed in you're just gonna
Get a message that says you need to sign into the PlayStation
Network well
You know I know a lot of people myself
Included it doesn't really matter because
With the PS3s having the wireless
Internet built in and everything I'm pretty much
Always connected to PlayStation Network
There's very little time I'm
Not playing the PS3 and I'm not online
But
I mean what if my internet went down
And I wanted to play
A video game which I do a lot
When my internet goes down to kind of pass the time
You know if I can't play wow I guess I'll go play
Xbox or PSN
So
I mean this thing is kind of weird
This is no better than the Ubisoft thing in my opinion
No it's not
You have to understand
Why they're doing it in the first place
They're doing it because Sony
Has this thing and this
It's kind of a loophole basically
They had a thing where if you download a title
Say you buy whatever
You know a game flower or something like that
You can repurchase
Or redownload flower onto
Five different systems
Say your system dies or whatever
Instead of having to you know
Change your
Account so that
It's linked to a new system
Instead of that you have
Five different chances to download stuff
Well here's what people are doing
They were basically having one person
Buy it then downloading it for four
Of their other friends on their other system
So basically one person buys the game and five people
Play it
This is a feature that's in
The Playstation Network
This is something that launched with the PS3
Capcom apparently
Wanted to try something because they didn't like
The fact that they're losing out on
80% of their sales potentially
So what they're doing now
Is they're limiting that to one person
Now so you have to be the person
That bought it in order to play the game
So not only are they making you be
Online they are also
Limiting the fact that you can't share this
Or redownload it again
Unless you're the person that used it
And if it turns out to be a success
This is going to be something that's going on with
All their titles going forward
Well what's also interesting about this
Capcom actually issued somewhat of an apology
Later in the week a couple days after this news hit
Capcom actually
Sent out a statement
Capcom would like to formally apologize for the issues
Consumers are having with the PS3 version of
Final Five Double Impact
Typically the notification for a required Playstation
Network connection appears in the full game
Description when a game is downloaded from the Playstation
Store
Unfortunately when populating this content
Was overlooked and wasn't included in the
Versions of the game that released in North America
And Asia
It was included in the release for Europe
Capcom should have checked to make sure the notification
Was included when the final game was made available
And we sincerely apologize for this oversight
The DRM requirements for Final Five Double Impact
Are not unique to this release
This protection mechanism has been implemented in numerous
Games offered on the Playstation Store before
Which ones?
Yeah I don't know
When it was brought to our attention and the notification was missing
We texted quickly with Sony Computer Entertainment
America and a fix is on the way
Yay they're gonna fix it
Wait a minute
They're not really gonna fix the DRM are they?
They're just gonna fix the description
Probably
That's the hidden subtext there
We would like to thank our vigilant fans for bringing this
To our attention and we will exercise better
Scrutiny on future Capcom releases
Next time we might use some lube
Honestly
Here's the thing
It sucks that you have to be online
And yeah okay it will suck that you won't be able to play Final Fight
If your internet goes out
Big deal
Play something else
I mean seriously
That can't be the only game you're playing
And finally I mean really the whole reason they're doing this
Is because people are exploiting a feature
In the Playstation 3
That's really meant for if your system craps out
So you can redownload your content
Do you really want that to be removed?
Later on you know cause you have people
Complaining about it and then your console dies
Oh guess what you gotta download everything again
Oh I mean you have to rebuy everything again
Well I mean you're making a good point
Loki but at the same time
I just don't like this
I have nothing to back that up
I just don't like it
But no I'm not the only one
And isn't this just inviting
Cause a lot of this is really reminiscent
Whatever the reason is for it
It really isn't that much different from the Ubisoft DRM
Please hack me
Please find a workaround for this
Please pretty please
Hackers of America, break me
It's the same type of logic
That you know you apply to children
Tell them they can't do something
What do they want to do? Do it
Why don't they just send a fancy wedding invitation
On the fancy paper that says you are cordially invited
To hack the fuck out of this game
Cause people can't really
Hack the Playstation Network right now
Right now
It's cause they took the Linux out
But they'll be back
Okay I'm booting whoever this recruit is
In the chat room
New rule, you have to have a nickname
Well you would have to have one if you want me to read your name
Cause otherwise there's nothing to read
When you guys make a lovely Jack comments
Why are you booting a recruit?
Jamie's on the warpath tonight
I'm getting sick of people who just come in and ghost
And if you want to ghost like make
I am a ghost for your nickname
But otherwise don't just be there
Maybe they don't have anything to say right now
They could be a spy
They're not a spy
What's going to stop a spy from just saying
I'm a normal person
Okay they gave themselves a name
Right as soon as they gave themselves a name
They got kicked
See you guys are mean
Alright chat.orangelsonsready.com
Some actual comments from chat
Bochikawa whether or not they want to get more sales
Still makes a hassle for the regular legitimate user
That's going to cost them sales from people not liking the hassle
You know Loki not everybody's home is wired to be on the internet all the time
Then how are you going to download the damn game
Well not wired to be on the internet the whole time
What possible situation would you have
Other than your internet going out
That you would not be on the internet
You can't dial up
You can't dial up and download
Maybe not everybody has wireless internet in their house
So they actually run a wire when they want to download something
Then they pull the wire when they're done
So they're going to have to run that wire every time they want to play the game
All the way in the kid's bedroom or something
I don't know just
I don't think Final Fight is a really good kid's game
When I say kid it could be a 15, 16 year old where you know
If I had a 16 year old I wouldn't care if he was playing Final Fight
I can think of worse games
Even if there are training hookers
I'm sure they have
You know a computer
Download MAME download the ROM done
Look at that don't even have to be connected to the internet
And it doesn't cost you anything
Frisbee says in what incentive does paying for DRM
Infective programs give?
So I think the subtext I'm reading there is that
When you know this is the case you should just not buy it
Or buy it on our system
I did buy it on Xbox I had no idea this is the case
Apparently a lot of people bought it on Xbox
Because this took a few days to come out
The news which maybe says something right there
I don't know
Regardless we're going to see the DRM mania
Continue for the next few years I'm sure
As we get into the next system
That sounds like a photoshop to me
Just take DRM mania and remove the U out of it
I was thinking the same thing
What if the only thing you can find is a percussion freaks machine
Then you're not looking hard enough
Dark Soccer what you got for us
Good news
Marvel vs Capcom 3
They've released the poster art and there's already speculation
As to who is going to be in the game
So it goes without saying that everything we said last week
Yeah it happened
So of course for the confirmed characters we have
Morgan
Chris Redfield
Wolverine
Hulk
Iron Man
Is Chris Redfield the Jill sandwich guy?
Shirmi's trying to get out
Yeah from Resident Evil
Him vs the Hulk I'm surprised he hasn't been stepped on and just gone squish
The little trailer they put up was pretty freaking cool
What did you think of the art style in it?
I liked it
It totally made me think of Street Fighter 4
I've heard some mixed things on it
Not everybody I've talked to was a fan of the art style in the trailer
Well they can suck it
It's just like Tatsunoko vs Capcom if you ask me
At any rate the speculation on who the other characters are and a lot of these I actually
Although I have a few speculations of my own from this
They're showing Felicia
Super Scroll
Captain America
Doctor Doom
Although I'm sort of thinking Taskmaster
Maybe
Deadpool of course duh
Chun Li who cares
Question mark person
Oh yay question mark person
I just happened to be looking
And they haven't identified that person yet
There's one back there that could be Iron Fist
Black Widow or someone else
Dante
And Frank West
Fuck yes to Frank West
Hell yes
And looking at some of these others
They're actually even speculating
Some of the
They're speculating Trish maybe
And a few other kinda
I would say
Kinda niche
Marvel people not really niche
It's just you have to really be fans of the books that they're in
Well if that rumor that came up last week
Is true that it's gonna have just a
Mass amount of characters in it
I think they're gonna have to get a little niche
Yeah Dormammu
Is in it well they're saying
Mephisto got crossed out I think that's funny
But yeah
I don't care I just want it
And you're just gonna play Deadpool all day
You know just Deadpool all day long
He has to talk the whole time though
It's not Deadpool if he does not talk
Your ass off the entire game
So they're gonna have to pay his voice actor a lot
We'll see what happens
And I also want the guy to do the voice actor
Who does Deadpool in Friends
Now there was some reaction in our chat room
To you going over those names
We had Act Deaf yelled out Deadpool
And then Yland
Followed that up by saying Be Arthur
Now I
I don't remember what capcom game
Be Arthur was in was there a Golden Girls game
No I have to explain this
Deadpool
Has or had
A major obsession with Be Arthur
And who doesn't
As in like
She was his hot chick ideal
Who's Be Arthur
And I think it's funny how people have paid attention
To that cause like in the Deadpool in Friends
PSA things that are out
In Deadpool's
Apartment on there he's like don't you wish your girlfriend
Was hot like bee
With a picture of Be Arthur
I never knew that
You know I only you know I don't really read
Comics that's no secret you know I just
Don't but I liked the character
In the what Iron Man movie
When Ryan Reynolds played Deadpool
He played Wade
Well he was funny
That's pretty much the type of non stop
Talking your ear off
I want to hear except you know more nuts
Cause he is crazy
So sadly
They weren't talking about any
Type of like actual Be Arthur
Being in the game
Now they're bringing a Deadpool and of course
Deadpool has to be followed by Be Arthur and
Someone hasn't said Chimichangas
Why wasn't there a Golden Girls
Video game actually can you imagine
Like firing up you know Playstation Network
You know and hopefully the DRM
The cheesecake is a lie
That's right and then you know you just turn it on
And then
The cheesecake is a lie
What exactly would you do in the Golden Girls video game
Eat cheesecake
The plan should be a hoe
Sophia would be angry
She'd have her anger snark meter
You know what
I would like to see this as an XNA game
Like I realize you can't do a Golden Girls
XNA game cause copyright IP
But there's no reason you couldn't do a
Senior
Silver Ladies
The Silver Ladies
You know adventure game
Or something
I always thought it was funny that Estelle Getty played Be Arthur's character's mom
Yet she was younger
That's what they call makeup
I love Estelle Getty
I like Be Arthur too I used to watch Mod
Re-runs of Mod
I love them both rest in peace
Betty White hosting Saturday Night Live
Next week by the way
Betty White doing a roast
I saw her
It was something else that she was
Participating in a roast for somebody
She is snarky
I love her
I'll tell YYR to get right on it
Please make that happen
I don't care who does it
We need that to happen
Rama says call it three old biddies
Actually weren't there four
One was the mom so whatever
SSG100Matt says wait wait
Is this an OLR dream game?
This is a Rob Roberts dream game
Three biddies in the ho
I don't think it's just me
I was listening to
The Warcraft outsiders
In the car
They're another all game show
Michelle and John I think his name
I think Michelle's sister was the guest this week
And she was talking about that she named her character
Spornak
And wow
This is my new favorite
Person that I've ever heard on a podcast
She named her character
After the Golden Girls and I think Michelle
Or somebody else popped in and said yeah I named one of my
I named one of my priests
Betty Smite
And I was like this is
That's it my next
My next
Star Trek character
Is gonna be
I'm just gonna name her Sophia the old
And pick like
The old person face and everything
And make her super short and Ferengi
I'm gonna put that on the list of people I want to have
On OLR in the future the chick that named her character
Spornak
Cause that's awesome you're a true inspiration
To us all alright
Let's move on to other gaming news
Loki's just sitting here going
What is this show tonight?
I don't know
Well
Just like Nintendo to delay some stuff
Actually just like anybody to delay some stuff
But Nintendo
In this particular instance has delayed
Two upcoming games that are very
Highly anticipated
Including Sin and Punishment Star Successor
And Metroid Other M
Sin and Punishment has only been pushed back a few weeks
From June 7th to June 27th
And unfortunately
Though the
Metroid Other M game
Which was originally due on
June 27th
Well that's been pushed all the way to August 31st
No that was the day after my birthday and I'm gonna have to wait
Two more months
That gives me enough time to actually hook up
My Nintendo Wii again
I haven't plugged it in since I moved
Why are these games being delayed Loki?
No reason was given
Other than it's Nintendo just
Doing Nintendo things
Do you think that maybe the
Games aren't finished
Or they failed some type of quality check or what?
I don't think that they're not finished yet
I think that they're just
Spacing out their titles
For the rest of the year
They had two games coming out in June
That really didn't have anything on the plate
For the rest of the summer
And maybe polishing
Metroid Other M a little bit more
Or maybe
They're gonna add some gimmicky
Crap to add onto it
I hope that god they're not delaying this
To add on some like vitality
Sensor support or some crap like that
Oh I hope not either
Well uh
At least you'll get the plate at E3 I'm sure
Yeah I guess that's true
Alright well all this news
About the Nintendo Wii and the delays
Leads me into a little something
I want to do on tonight's show
We don't do this very often especially on the podcast
But we're gonna do a little something called
Secret Club tonight is what we're gonna do
Here on the show
That's right Secret Club
It's a secret to everyone
Alright
Here's the deal with Secret Club
I have a secret and I want to tell you guys
Cause I can't keep secrets to myself
And this is one of those things where somebody said
Hey Rob I found out this secret and you know I don't really care
If you talk about it on your show
So of course I've got a big mouth
And I'm gonna tell you guys
There's actually two kinds of secrets
Cause you know I do have friends that work with games
So if you tell anyone this I'm gonna beat your fucking ass with my shoe
Those I don't tell anybody
But then there's the ones that's like
Hey Rob I found out this little piece of news
And I don't care who you tell
So this is a little something secret
But you didn't hear it from me
Cause you know due to things that have happened in the past on this show
I don't really want to get
You know I don't think
OLR really gains anything
From you know having broken the news first
Or what have you
But it's a little secret something something
I didn't hear it here but you heard it
The Black Nintendo Wii
Is coming
And it's coming soon
I have it on good authority from a friend
That works for a major
Store that sells a lot of
Game hardware and video games
That there was some type of
Alert this week that they're going to be getting
A large shipment of Black Nintendo
Wiis on May
23rd is the release date of the
Black Wii and apparently this actually
Ties into something we've heard about before because
This is the bundle that's also going to include
We're not sure and
The details were a little sketchy from
My source cause he couldn't remember if it was
That it was coming with just the
Wii Motion Plus or if it was
The Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports
Resort It's Wii Sports Resort and Wii Motion Plus
But Loki has previously heard of
That there was going to be a new bundle that matched
What we saw at Walmart before but we're
Putting two and two together
What Loki had probably heard about before is actually going to be this
Black Nintendo Wii bundle
That's right
There was no color specifications
Or anything just basically that they're
Going to be releasing new bundles soon
And that
We probably weren't going to get any
Cause they're dicks
And folks from chat
I haven't heard anything else about the specs
No it's not HD, dream on guys
It's just a Wii
It's the Wii, it's the same damn Wii
Except here's the difference, instead of
White plastic
They used black plastic
That's it, don't expect
Anything else, so sorry
It's not HD
And it may be an extra free game cause I'm assuming they're also
Including Wii Sports in there so you get
Wii Sports and Wii
Sports Resort, it'd be nice if they added another
Controller into it
I doubt it
I think it's supposed to be the same price
It is, it's going to be the exact
I must have forgot to say that, it is the exact
Same price as the Wii you're paying for today
So in a way it's a bit of a price drop too
I wonder what they're going to do with
I think it actually may be replacing
The old Wii SKUs
So white Wiis are going to be rare
That's right, super rare
TigerClaw in chat says a black Wii is a no brainer
We sort of had a hint of that recently
When we saw a black Wiimote on the most recent trailer
For Metroid Other M, well they're already selling black Wiimotes
Yeah they are
And then the folks overseas are saying
We've already had the black Wii
Hey hey hey hey hey
I'm not controlling the news
I don't write the news, I just report it
The black Wii is not out in the states
So they're finally getting it
May 23rd, and that's what I'm telling you
Is the date, May 23rd
Alright
Yeah it's already been out in other parts of the world
Don't they have other colors too?
Like remember E3 years ago there was like a pink Wii
And a blue Wii and all this other stuff
I don't know
Let's see Tiger, no I'm sorry
SHA100Matt says so wait the black Wii isn't bigger than the white Wii?
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha everybody's a jokester here at Orange Laundry
Ha ha ha
Going back to something we were talking about a little bit earlier
TigerClaw sent me this link in chat
And I just have to share this with you guys
This link on YouTube that is just pretty fabulous here
This is what could be
It's an actual, somebody did this on the NES
It's like a hack or something
I don't know what
I don't know what that is
Some type of like hacked NES cartridge or something
So somebody's already started making my dream game
Alright
Let's move on to some real games shall we
How about Halo? Hey don't tune out
Halo, I've got Halo updates
Halo, Halo Reach specifically
Halo Reach apparently
Is going to, well you know
Who knew? Halo Reach
Is going to have all different types of releases
It's not just going to be regular Halo Reach
But there's going to be a bunch
Of other types of Halo Reaches coming out
This is a leak from a Best Buy
Ad apparently
60 bucks if you want to just get Halo Reach by itself
150 dollars
For the legendary edition
And there's going to be a limited edition
Of Halo Reach, it's going to be 80 dollars
Standard version is just the game itself
Limited version has a special
Case, collectibles
And in-game armor
The 150 dollar option
Apparently has all of that but also has
I guess more unique packaging and in-game
Armor, also a legendary
Noble 6 sculpture
I don't know if that's anything like
The little Master Chief hat that you could put on
Your cat for lols
You couldn't really put it on your cat just so you know
But sounds kind of similar
Can't you still get
That Halo 150 dollar edition
For like 60 bucks now discounted at price
There's people still sitting on that stuff
I'm not surprised
Hopefully this will sell a little better but we'll see
What do you think about all this game
Coming out in three different flavors, Loki?
They did it with Halo 3
And it was kind of fun
But hopefully people learned
You don't need to spend the money
To get a fake helmet
At least this has a nice sculpture that comes with it
I wouldn't pay that though
Yeah because if you think about it
You're basically paying
Between 80 and 150 you're paying like 70 dollars
For the sculpture, you could use that money to get
Another game if you wanted
Or you could use it to
Invest
And have 200 dollars
Next year
But there it is
I realize there are the fans that will pay
That money to have every little thing Halo
And who am I to criticize
If it was Final Fantasy 14 I'd probably be doing the same thing
I'd be like 150 dollars that's it
I'm paying the money right now
Shh
Well we've got some word from
Bimani style about Stride Nasty stuff
That's sponsoring it
And keep in mind I am completely allergic to it
And I don't even like to say the name of it
So it's nasty
It's Stride Gum
Nasty
Save the arcades too
But
Arcade Infinity
Is actually
One of the ones up in the
Competition for it
AI
Has been like a really big staple
In the Bimani community
They had all the imports in
They also had that weird Gundam game that was so cool
And like little Japanese ticket games
And Jameralami
And it's in LA
In case you didn't know
Well it's in East LA
It was born in East LA
And also they were selling import cars for a while
That's right
I think the owners were big big big on the import cars
I think they drove some nice cars
I actually
Looked into getting a Skyline from them
When I thought I had money
Nice
And that's where Loki did you play some crazy porn game there once
That's funny
I played a lot of crazy porn games there
That's where I first played
Gals Panic and Dancing Eyes
But at any rate
The competition is going on
Until June 15th
And they're talking about
The
AI
The owner says that if they win they want to get
Tycho and Juby
But you have to
Play a game of Calbots 2010
And get your final score
To the arcade you wish to support
And that's at savethearcades.stridegum.com
Well I mean
Is Arcade Infinity in danger of closing or something
I mean haven't they been threatening to close for a little while now
I don't see anything really about
But they're talking about if they won they'd get a Juby
Machine and all this other stuff
Or U-Beat or whatever it's called
I guess
Weird
We're not picking you up
I'm talking
I'm talking in the mic
Alright
Well if you want to support them then there you go
You can go play that little game and submit your score
But then you have to sign up for spam emails
So hopefully you have an actual spam email address
Or something to send stuff to
Alright let's go around the world
And take a look at some upcoming release dates
And games
That are coming to a living room near you
Loki
Yes lots of stuff coming out this week
Well not a whole ton
Start things off with
Super Street Fighter IV
That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3
And Xbox 360
Nier
That kind of a beat em up game
From Square Enix coming out on PlayStation 3
And Xbox 360 this week as well
Death of the Rights Retribution
Also on PlayStation 3
And Xbox 360
You're a fan of
Sexual Induendo and Boobies
Record of Argus War
The limited edition or the
What was it? The naughty
I forget the
Some naughty edition or whatever
Coming out on Xbox 360 does include
A mouse pad with fake boobs on it
And a pillow case with some chick on it
So that's going to be kind of neat
Harvest Moon
Hero of Leaf Valley coming out on
PSP
Splinter Cell Conviction making its way out
On PC this week with wonderful
DRM in tow
And
Free Running
A parkour sim
Coming out on the Wii this week
2010 FIFA World Cup
South Africa coming out on
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360
Wii and
I don't remember
And PSP I don't think there's a DS version on that one
I believe that's it
Oh no this is actually a pretty good deal
Pixel Junk Monsters Deluxe
Making its way out on
PSP in the UMD format
They've had this originally on
The PlayStation Network
But now you can buy it on UMD
Only $10
And it includes I believe some of the
Expansions for that. They're doing the same thing too
With Fat Princess coming out a little bit later on
In May
Not a bad thing at all
Alright. Any of that that you're going to pick up
Logie?
I'm going to try Super Street Fighter 4
And Nier
Yeah I'm going to pick up
Super Street Fighter 4
But this time I'm getting it on PS3
Because I would like to actually be able to control it better
So that's my whole thought there
This way you get arcade sticks Rob
Or just play it over here
And you're talking more money
But they're worth it
Xbox 360 in Japan
Sees the release of Super Street Fighter 4
This week as well in a regular and
Collectors Edition
Otherwise Splinter Cell Conviction is your other big release in Japan
This week. See some of the same games we're getting here
Also get released in Japan at the same time
Imagine that
Looking at some other consoles
Going over to the PlayStation 3
Same same. They also get Super Street Fighter 4
Over there
Regular and Collectors Edition
World Soccer winning 11 2010 gets a price reduction
For whatever that's worth
If you're a big fan of these soccer sims
On the Nintendo Wii
Not really a lot this week
Base Fishing Wii World Tournament
Andukensa X and a game called
Rooms comes out as well
From Hudson. That's all on the Nintendo Wii this week
On the PlayStation 2
I like the name of this game
Love Route Zero
Kiss Kiss Labyrinth
Yes that's really the name of the game
Love Route Zero
Kiss Kiss Labyrinth
It's an adventure game
You can get shots
But the box art looks to be like
All these dudes in school outfits
But there's this girl who looks like the prom queen
Yeah why am I trying to figure this out?
None of you are going to play it
I already know that. None of you are going to play it
Going on to the handheld systems
And looking at what is coming out
On the Nintendo DS
Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2
Is a big release from Squeenix this week
On the Nintendo DS
And lastly on the Sony PSP
Ikitosan Cross Impact
And that cross is spelled with an actual X
Just to be complicated
That is coming out in Japan
This week
That is a sequel to a former
PSP game
2D scrolling action
22 girls in this beat em up game
And their clothes come off
Is that really what this is about?
Well that's what Ikitosan is about
Based on what I've seen I guess
Nice
They fight and their clothes rip in very
Evocative ways I guess
Also Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker
I bet some of you guys might want to get that
There's also a full PSP pack for that game coming out
And I just like the name of this game
Marriage Royale Prism Story
Is also coming out
It's an adventure game
I don't really know what happens in this game
I guess it's like you play the girl going to get married
But I want to point this out there's a screenshot here
Where you have these three cute little anime girls
They're like working out or something
That is tragic
Um actually
No I know it's like a swimsuit
You know how girls wear the one piece and put the shirt on
No no Rob actually that's what
Um gym uniforms look like
Really? Yeah they're the little bloomer
Shorts How's that not caught on over here?
Cause we're prudes
Clearly
So
Alright so if you want some
You know culturally different things
There you can check out that game
You probably won't
Alright how about the UK DarkSakura
Yeah how about em
On the 28th serious Sam HD
The second encounter
The 30th 2010 FIFA World Cup
Yay
30th God of War Collection
Iron Man 2
Splinter Cell Conviction
Super Street Fighter 4
WarioWare Do It Yourself
And Wings of Prey
That's it
Too bad it's not the birds of prey
Making it's way to a video game
That would be kinda awesome
Or not
Alright Loki
Ah yes
Um
Okay so we talked a little bit
Well I said that we had
Splinter Cell Conviction
Coming out this week and there's horrible
DRM in tow well that might not be
That big of a problem
Apparently the hacker community
Which I thought this happened weeks ago but
Maybe they finally figured out
How to do it the correct way
They have found a way to get rid of the
DRM
That's in
These titles that are being released from
MovieSoft including Assassin's Creed 2
And Settlers 7
And I'm assuming
Splinter Cell Conviction coming soon
It should be easy to modify the work
With that and the hacker group of course
Um
Involved in doing that was
I believe
Skid Row
Fun name
Awesome
And you know it is a little bit different
Before they had different hacks that were
Just emulating
The authentication server
Or they were
Finding some way to trick this but this
Actually removes the DRM from
The title so
Um that's interesting
Now Loki your pal Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
The hack before worked
Up until a certain point of the game
Then it locked up so this must be news
That now it's working for the entire game
There you go
So Loki
I mean does this really
Surprise you because I kind of look at this and go
Yeah I already thought this happened too
I thought this happened within days after the DRM
I'm not surprised
Especially you know something like
This that's annoying a lot of people
Not only
The fact that they're coming out and saying oh
This is going to stop piracy for all of our titles
It just goes to show
You're going to waste money on this
I mean it slows people down but it
Definitely doesn't stop it
And really in the end the only people that get hurt
Are the people that legitimately buy the game
Of course now if you don't like the DRM
You can just go search online for the crack
So
Like I just I understand the need for DRM
Like I'm not like somebody who says
Oh every game should just like
Not have DRM at all
I just think what Ubisoft was doing was overkill
I mean come on when you disconnect from the internet
At all your game dumps
Like do you know how much I get disconnected from World of Warcraft
Because Comcast decides to fart on me
And it just you know like I'll be in the middle of something
And it completely screws up my game
Like
Oh my gosh at least that isn't like a long term
Irritating thing
Whereas you know I could see if I'm playing through one of these games
I'm not at a save point maybe I just cleared
Like a really tough part of the game it's like
Oh you're screwed you gotta do it again
Yeah it'd be different if it was like
Okay we noticed you're you know
It disconnected we're saving your progress
Now
And you know you can restart here later once it
Reconnects
I mean that would be semi reasonable
To be fair didn't Ubisoft change some of that
Where it doesn't you don't really get booted
For the entire game now or something
I don't know
But the thing is
I'm not buying their games on PC
Even if it were buying their games
Which I'm not so
I don't know
Alright
Well a couple last stories for you guys
Then we're going to get into the classic game of the week
Where Dark Soccer is going to walk down the
Vaults of gaming's history and pick out a game
That she thinks you kids ought to check out this week
But first something about a newer series
Something that's kind of been a bit
Under the radar and I think that is a pity
And that is DJ Hero
DJ Hero of course we know that DJ Hero
Is getting a sequel this year
And little little details are starting to trickle out
About it DJ Shadow
Apparently is going to be working
On the next DJ Hero he actually
Said in an interview on Radio 1
It was interesting I'm actually working
On the next one as well but yeah it was a
Trip so there you go
He's going to be in the second game also notable
He was in the first game too so he's
Like a repeat and I kind of figured
That would happen is that like how many
World famous DJ's are there
Are there really enough world famous
World famous
There are a lot of DJ's
I think out there that are world famous
But you know how many
Of them are you going to get to
Be in DJ Hero
I was very disappointed that they had
DJ Jazzy Jeff and there were no
You know
Will Smith songs in there at all
No mixes with Will Smith
That was very disappointing
Well there you go DJ Shadow
Is going to be in the next game
In DJ Hero 2
But DJ Hero 1 All Love Is Not Lost
Loki you'll be happy to hear this
There's actually another track pack coming out
Yeah this one I'm actually kind of excited about
Last one kind of sucked
Darude's Sandstorm
Mixed with Josh Winke's Higher
State of Consciousness is one of the songs
In the new DLC
Danny Bird's Red Mist
VIP is coming
Out as well and then this song
Wolfgang Gartner's Wolfgang's
5th Symphony Let me start off by
Saying that this song reminded me of something
That you would see in DDR
Here's a little clip of what this song
Sounds like
It's a little noisy for me
Sounds like a remix song from Boom Boom Rocket
Remember how Boom Boom Rocket had nothing
But classical remixes
And it's really hard too
Like that's the other catch is that the song is
Incredibly hard and I guess all these songs that are in
This pack are supposed to be a very high difficulty
Hence why they are calling it
The Domination Pack
Because you can't just say it normally
It's the Domination Pack
Yippie Skippy
Are we going to be dominated?
Apparently you will be dominated
By the Domination Pack
So
But yeah I guess that song sounded okay
It's a little noisy for me
But I guess that's because there was so much mixing going on
I don't know
I think that that's the thing
Some of the effects are a little overdone
There's people that are going to like it
Don't get me wrong
Alright I don't know if I'll buy it
I'm curious to hear what the other songs sound like though
Anyhow let's get to the part of the show
Where we like to take a trip down the
Halls of gaming history
Dark Soccer
Dark Soccer is going to jump into the vault
And dive in and find a game
That she says hey you ungrateful little
Children
Because she says that a lot
Not teaching him Doctor Who references
I didn't teach him that
He watches Doctor Who
You kids ought to be
Playing this classic video game
So you can see where the games of today came from
Dark Soccer what is the
Classic video game of the week this week?
Warcraft Orcs and Humans
Oh snap
I didn't put this in for all of you addicts
Who don't know your roots
Fair enough
Warcraft Orcs and Humans
Freaking boring ass game
This game is awesome
Shut your mouth
See I wanted that reaction
So I didn't put this in
Really for me
Because I hate real time strategy games
I don't like them I do not have fun with them
But
There are enough of you
That don't know where your game came from
Sorry
No it's true there's not
There's a lot of people that play World of Warcraft
That never played a Warcraft game before
I mean it's worth noting
I actually mentioned to someone
When World of Warcraft just came out
Did you play Warcraft before?
No it just came out
Poor childhood
I see so tonight is about edumacation
It's about edumacation
It's a real time strategy game
It came out in 1994
November 1984 and came out on the Mac in 96
And
It was a sequel Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness
And then of course
Warcraft 3
Warcraft 3 came out not too long ago
If you look on Dan's little shelf there
He's got a copy
So Dan obviously likes it
And
It's basically
You know like I said real time strategy
Where you have the humans of Azeroth
Against the invading orcs
And then both sides have to
Fight off wild monsters
Sometimes you can
Enlist the monsters
So basically
You've got your melee groups
You have ranged groups and spellcasters
It is built
Off of the Dune 2
Gameplay
Which is like build a base, build an army
Destroy the enemy
Blah blah blah
Different mission types where you have
Rebels of each player
So you can
Rescue, rebuild towns
And friendly forces
And do all this other stuff
And you also have to be able to
Efficiently use your platoon
Also
In one mission you have to kill the orc chief's
Daughter or something
It also
Let you use
Lands
So that you could play against each other
So it had that
Start of the MMO remember
Sorta yeah
Like the old school battle net
But I was more Diablo
On battle net
Well you have to go through
With this you also have to cultivate
Your resources
Be careful about where you dig for gold
Where you chop your wood
If you exhaust your resources
Then you have to get them
Differently
You have to basically
Regrow your forest while you're taking
From them, you have different types of magical
Buildings, you have
Different types of sorcerers
Like you have a cleric, you can have
Necrolite that raises skeletons
Ooh
Elementals, that type of thing
The conjurer versus
The warlock you know
Um
And then of course it's sort of an overhead
Interface
And it's a click and point
Um
Yeah you know
It actually
Was
I see I thought
That it was
I played some a little bit but like I said I don't really care for
RTS games
They just I'm sort of like what
I can play them and I'm good at them
I'm just sort of like what this is boring
But
It clearly caught on I mean
Cause remember we had you know
Starcraft
You know the whole
I guess themes to the game sort of caught on
To and I mean now we've got World of Warcraft
Making it you know less sucky
Again this is Jamie who
Does not like RTS's
I actually own this game
And I loved it so
There is actually an RTS game
That I like but it's a Macross game
That came out on um
The uh PC Engine CD
I will say this though I am weird
I fully admit I'm weird cause I don't really
Care for Starcraft and I
To this day have never played Warcraft 3
You've got it right here
I just for some reason have never played it
I really should because maybe some of the stuff
In World of Warcraft will make more sense
But yeah I have played the old school Warcraft
And I did play Warcraft 2
And I actually tried to make it a point to put in games
That I can be really excited about
But it was just you know
It seemed to me that with everybody
Being all
World of Warcraft World of Warcraft blah blah blah blah
You know it helps to know
Where it came from it helps to go back to your roots
Um so as
Far as other um
Ones that came out though it did have some uh
Predecessors things that actually
Um
Would uh
Inspire the game and build the
Groundwork for it there was
Definitely some competitors
Um
Like I said Dune 2
Um and then Warcraft works and humans
Came out after that
Um
And then um
There was actually a random map generator
That was for it
And that came from
Civilization Rob
Yes
I thought that you'd find that interesting
Um
Command and Conquer actually um
Borrowed from
Warcraft and Age of Empires
Um put all of them in
In the random map generator when it came out
Um Modern Wars
Um for the Commodore 64
What uh incorporated
The use of land play
So it really
Not only was it influenced by
Some others but it actually pulled influence
It's actually even listing realms as
An old Amiga and Atari ST
Um game as being an influence on it
Um
And of course for sequels we got
Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness
In 95 and
Warcraft 2 Beyond the Dark Portal in 96
And then um
Coming out later
Of course was Warcraft 3
Um Reign of Chaos
And then there was Starcraft like I said
And Starcraft Brood War and
World of Warcraft
And soon as Starcraft 2 for you RTS fans
Yeah I was about to get to that
So yeah Warcraft you know
It's expanded there's
Card games, comics, there's a ton of books
You've seen the books I'm sure
They actually um there's actually
A film called Warcraft
In production to be out in 2011
Yeah Spider-Man dude's
Doing it right?
Yeah I think there's also um
There's board games too
Um but yeah
Warcraft it really did
Kinda spur a whole you know
A whole big thing
11 million people
Can't be wrong or can they?
Addicts
Addicts
Your classic game of the week a true
Classic indeed in every way
Shape and form don't listen to Dark Sakura
No I'm not saying it's a
Bad game I'm saying I don't like
RTS's
And I and even that's including
Actraiser Warcraft oh you
Don't like Actraiser I didn't say I don't
Like Actraiser Actraiser
Is a good game I get bored
Bored bored after a while
I'm gonna cry alright
Oh Rob there's a there's a difference
Between thinking something is crap
And just not liking the genre of it
Yeah
I can see that I'm trying to think if there's something
I feel that way about I do every so often like
You know smiting people in Actraiser
See I would say that's how I feel about
Sports games but like I can go back and play
Old school sports games no problem like I love Tecmo
Bowl, Blades of Steel like the way they used to be before they
Just got super high impact like
Yeah before they got like really complicated
But that that's my point you know
I I'll start playing and I'll be like yeah
This is cool then I'm like uh huh
I will say
Not my thing I might have liked Warcraft
But I wasn't very good at it I never got very
Far in it like I'm not good
At RTS's
This whole thing I can
Do the strategy just fine
I just get bored with it it's not
Really my thing
Alright fair enough
Uh if you would
Like to suggest a classic game of the week
Too bad Dark Soccer doesn't take suggestions
By the way actually but you could always try the
Mailbag I need help from the chat room
I'm looking for a
PlayStation copy
Of NBA Jam
If you find it
No matter what variety
Of version it is for the
PlayStation first PlayStation
Let me know
What's the reason? Dan wants it
And it's
Actually hard to find Really?
Yes We are looking
To add it to the collection because we have everything else
We want
Completion for our NBA Jamage
Shaka-laka
Alright I hope you find it He's on fire
You could play it on the PS3 He's been seriously back there
In the vault playing NBA Jam
For days
In a row If you could find
The PlayStation 1 you could play it on a PS3
Which is the cool thing Yes Because PS3's
They all have backwards compatibility no matter what one you have
Yes but we also do still have
A functional PlayStation Oh nice
That still had the IO port
And everything so we can use our little
Clipping thing Good times But I want
Help finding it Even if you
Find a I don't want to say this
On the air Even if you find a burn of it
Somewhere let us know
Because really we're running to just
Check it out but we do we would prefer

We have more to come in part B tonight
Including some other news
Out of the Capcom event this week
I mean a lot of it we reported last week as rumors
They've turned to fact
But we do have some extra details to come with that
We'll get into that as well
Some big rumored games for Xbox Live Arcade
Some more in the ongoing
Infinity Ward saga
And much more coming up when we come back
After a break here on Orange
Lounge Radio
Welcome back everybody to more of
Orange Lounge Radio we are live
Right now at All Games Radio
www.allgames.com
On this lovely Sunday evening
The 25th of April 2010
For episode 364
Of our little program where we talk about
Video games and
It's been a fun show so far tonight
We've had news about DJ Hero
Yes even a type of
Food company that apparently Jamie won't say
Where they save the arcades at
Campaigns some Marvel vs. Capcom news
DRM debates
Television on the Xbox and plenty more news
To go through this week
Loki why don't you start us off with some fast
News tonight
Yes there's some WiiWare releases
Coming soon on
May 17th
Including that well
The next title in the Bit.Trip
Series Bit.Trip Runner
Will be coming out that day on WiiWare
And also there's some
Summer DSiWare release
Dates as well to share
Including Photo Dojo
Which looks like a side scrolling
Fighting game that uses a DSi's
Camera to add you to
The game
That's kind of neat I guess
Kind of gimmicky but fun
Earthworm Jim
Coming out also on
May 10th
And apparently I guess that's going to be an
Update to the SNES version
Of the game
Really
Another Frogger game
Frogger returns
Yet again on
People must be buying them Loki
May 24th
Konami has Frogger
Metal Torrent
On May 24th
Is a
Kira developed Shmup game
It looks pretty awesome
Xscape
Is I guess a
Sequel to Game Boy
Title
Or I guess a title X
From Q Games
And it's like a first person
Tank combat game
But really trippy looking
And then some other stuff
Coming out
Hero of Sparta
On May 31st
Flame Trail on June 7th
And Akapa's Trail on
June 14th
Then also another title that's going to be
Coming soon
This is kind of a pseudo
3D game
Luxley's
Lineup
And what's kind of unique about this
This is a game that came out in Japan
On DSiWare as well
And it's kind of a 3D game
It uses the
DSi's camera
To kind of trick the user
Into
Viewing the environment
In kind of a 3D dimensional fashion
You basically tilt the screen around
And doing so will change your perspective
In the game
And it's basically kind of a hidden
Objects game I guess
It looks kind of cool
Coming out as well
And then non-DSi related
Stuff
Battlefield Heroes
Is going to be getting some more
Upgrades
In the form of
Jetpacks
As well as some new maps and
New game mode
They're going to be getting
That's funny
I forgot that they had the
Michael Jackson content that one time
Anyways
I guess they're going to be getting
A new map
Called Midnight Mayhem
And a new mode that's going to be called
V2 Vengeance
Where players must capture and control
A giant rocket
But hey
Look, see they're
Bringing out jetpacks before Halo Reach
Can
Do you think that's why they're doing it?
Maybe
Maybe to get the jump on it?
I don't know
Just to be fun
Alright
Going to some other release dates coming up
We have some Xbox release dates
And some of the games that are coming out for the rest of April
On April 28th
New Game Room releases
That's right, finally some new titles for Game Room
And these will be under
Microsoft's Game Room pricing
Of either $3 for one
$5 for both or $0.50 for one play
Super Breakout from Atari
Pitfall and Mega Mania from Activision
I don't remember Mega Mania
Is that a game that rings a bell to you?
Mega Mania by Activision
I know the name, I just don't remember the game
I can't remember it either, I certainly know Pitfall
Night Stalker from Mattel
I'm assuming that's in television
Rack Em Up by Konami
Real Sports Volleyball by Atari
And Basketball by Atari
So those are all some new Game Room releases
Certainly I think Pitfall and Breakout are probably the standouts there
Although I want to say Mega Mania
Ringing a bell
But there's some other stuff on Xbox Live
This week we had Puzzle Chronicles and After Burner Climax
You know I meant to check out Puzzle Chronicles
Even though it looked a little weird
But next week is Tecmo Bowl on the 28th
So that's pretty cool
Also some Mega Man 10
Releases on the 28th
The Endless Attack mode
And two more special stages
Special Stage 2 and Special Stage 3
And then BioShock 2 gets the Rapture Metro pack
On April 29th
As well as a Black Market Aerial pack
For Just Cause 2 on April 29th
Being added to Games On Demand
On April 27th
Shrek the 3rd, Far Cry 2, and
Kane & Lynch Dead Men
And I don't know if Loki's interested
But if he wants to pimp out his avatar with Saints Row 2 items
He can do that on April 28th
I'm surprised that they're even doing that
Seeing as the game came out what, two years ago?
I mean seriously?
Isn't it a little late?
Is it a missed opportunity much?
Alright
Farmville News
I can't believe I'm reporting on this
What does this show come to?
But I think it's important to say
No I'm not going to tell you how to make money
Harvesting pineapples or whatever
But I think it goes without saying that Farmville
Is expanding beyond Facebook
And this would be because of a website
I guess that spies on domain names
That people are registering
And Zanga, the company behind Farmville
Has registered FarmvilleAndroid.com
FarmvilleiPad.com
FarmvilleiPhone.com
And FarmvilleSMS.com
And those are all
Domain names that are registered
By the Farmville folks
There you go
By the way I guess they're all also forwarding to
Farmville.com
So there you go
So needless to say
Farmville is slowly taking over the world
Run while you still can
If you're worried about Fishville or any of that yet
Also worthy of mention
There's a rare NES game called
Euphoria
Not like EU but U-F-O-U-R-I-A
Euphoria
It's been rated by the OFLC
Which is the Australian Ratings Board
This means that a virtual console release
Is likely possible
What's interesting about this game
It's pretty rare but it was actually done by Sunsoft
You might remember Sunsoft recently
Is kind of having a re-arising
They put out Blaster Master on Virtual Console
There was that OK
Blaster Master upgrade game
That also hit Virtual Console
Now apparently Euphoria the Saga is
Coming out as well. It's a Metroidvania
Type of game is what they're saying
It's a NES game
And it stars this character
You get separated from his friends
And you are looking through the world for your lost companions
I guess it's kind of like Goonies 2 in that regard
Hey actually that sounds kind of awesome
Goonies 2 is kind of Metroidvania 2
So there you go
The game was released in Europe just so you know
But I don't believe it was ever released actually in the US
Hence why it's rare
So there you go Euphoria possibly
On Virtual Console but usually those ratings news
Means yeah yeah they're coming
It's a cute little game
Real quickly before Jamie takes over with some news
The chat room is again complaining that the stream
Had failed and I guess we blacked out for a little bit there
Unfortunately
We don't know what causes it
And Bobby Blackwolf
Wants to clarify because you guys are hearing
That little bumper that says
All games are switching between it's live and on demand
Then that must mean it's on our end and it's not the all games computer
However we are not doing
Anything out of the ordinary
There's no one else's here but us 3's
There's no Xbox games going on or nothing
So you can thank Jamie's lovely internet provider
Hey!
Comcast. It's Comcastic
They were a wonderful shade of crap this morning
You know what my Warcraft has been going down too
In the area so you know what
Nobody's running porn
We did a porn check
Everything's fine so we just
We gotta keep on rolling with the show sorry guys
By the way
I do want to clarify that specifically
It is tournament edition
NBA Jam tournament edition for Playstation
That I'm looking for
Yes there's some on Amazon
But Dan hasn't told me I can buy it yet
Anyway
Brightband updates we have some new
Tracks coming out
There is Busted
Thunderbirds are Go
For 160
Microsoft points and 200
Wii points
Flyleaf again and Silverchair
Tomorrow
I don't see anything about an actual
Pack
Just the 3 tracks
Also somebody finally beat Castlevania
With a DDR pad
The old school
Castlevania like the first one
This dude named Nick Hagman
Played
The virtual console
Original Castlevania
Using a DDR Mario
Mix controller
And it took 62 lives
In more than 4 hours
But he did it
Wait a minute I'm looking at the YouTube here
Of the guy I guess who did it here
I don't want to hear his little monologue
I just want to see him play
And it looks like he's
Well in some pictures he's just
Sitting kind of using his hands but now
On this YouTube I'm looking where he's fighting Dracula
He is actually using his feet
To do it so
Cause I was gonna
Criticize this a little bit if he was actually just sitting
There kind of hitting the buttons but apparently he's actually
Dancing around I wonder if this kid lost weight
Doing it although he looks pretty
Skinny to begin with so
Wow
I slayed Pounce and
Dracula
Congratulations I guess
Yay for you
You have more time than I do
A winner it's you
And then Marvel vs Capcom
Comic books actually Udon
Who's been doing a lot of the Street Fighter
And you know basically any of the
The Capcom related
Comic titles that have come out
Are actually already
Discussing
The
Possibility of doing
Marvel vs Capcom
Of course they have to get the okay through Marvel as well
Marvel does their own thing
So who knows it'd have to be
Like a joint release but
Marvel does what Marvel wants
Yeah but hey it could be cool
It could be kind of interesting
What would you want to see in a Marvel vs Capcom
Comic book?
Deadpool
The Adventures of Deadpool
And Dan
Deadpool and Dan
Disney vs Capcom
The actual Dan is here to say something
Disney vs Capcom
Disney vs Capcom
I want Deadpool and Dan
How would that work?
Deadpool and Dan
Alright
I don't even know what's happening anymore
Help me
My husband hijacking the show again
Yeah again
Let's get into some Twitter topics
Every week we solicit your tweets
At www.Twitter.com
Slash O-L-R is our username
O-L-R
Show us your tweets
Where's the tweets? Here we go
TheShadowSniper sent us some tweets saying
I'm unable to listen live because I work late Sundays
I do carry around my Blackberry
Is it possible to listen live through my phone?
Ooh
Unfortunately we know of an iPod app
An iTouch app
I guess it runs on the iPad
That's the all games radio app
If you just search for all games
Or allgames.com in the iTunes store
That's a great way to listen
Unfortunately you're asking about the Blackberry
My advice would be
Get one of those, there's got to be like a radio tuner
Type app depending if your Blackberry
Has apps
You would actually be able to
Tune into the feed directly
It's just a shoutcast feed
So any feed that will do shoutcast streams
You can listen to all games radio on
TheShadowSniper also asks
What game ending is your favorite
Because of its twist ending
Or its great conclusion
This is a good topic I don't think we've
Talked about in a very long time
Favorite video game ending, DarkSakura?
Huh? Favorite video game ending
Favorite video game ending?
It was a twist?
It doesn't have to be, it says
What was your favorite because of its twist
Or great conclusion?
I don't really know
I mean I loved all the million endings
For Chrono Trigger
That goes without saying
I loved the multiple endings for Symphony of the Night
Oh no
Richter's dead
He was controlled by Shaft
You know
I have to say that
My favorite ending
Is Maria's ending from
Dracula X
Where she's walking along with her happy
Mamba music
Her animal buddies are following her along
Yeah, because that really goes with the Castlevania
Game
Loki?
I like the ending to Final Fantasy VI
I was kind of
Going to go along those lines too
And say Final Fantasy IV was actually my favorite
Ending, it was like a 20 minute
Epic ending back in the day
Good stuff, that was one of my favorite endings
As far as like a twist
Ending, I'm trying to remember games that had like a twist
That made me go like, oh my gosh
I don't know, for some reason
I'm not thinking of any I've thought in my head right now
Plus, you have to remember I have Gamer ADD
So I don't beat a lot of video games
I play them for about an hour and then I'm like, ooh
Shiny, I'm gonna go play something else
So
But yeah, you know the Final Fantasy series is always
Dependable for good endings, I think those are
Definitely up there
So, alright
Also, I always loved the endings in
Street Fighter II
The little stories that were just so random
Always favorites of mine too
Let's see, Spazinator PSN
Says, I can't exactly say when
But hopefully if all goes well
Down the time I anticipate some
Epic news
Well, you can't just leave it at that
Say what the epic news is
Okay, Tigerclaw gives us like a ton of
Gaming links and we don't have time to
Read them all, I'm sorry, it's kind of a lot
We got a lot of Twitter topics tonight
But I'll read at least a couple of these here
Yosho Inori Ono says
Ask Capcom if you want another
Dark Stalkers game
I'm sure there's a lot of people that want to see
A new Dark Stalkers game come out
And this is an interview with Video Games
Daily during a Super Street Fighter IV
Preview in London
Yosho Inori Ono, who is the Super Street Fighter IV
Producer, he actually has said that
You know what, he wants to make a sequel to
Dark Stalkers, which of course if you've never
Played it, it was awesome, it was like a fighting game
It was like Vampires and other like
There were sequels, there were
Punches of sequels
There hasn't been one in years, you know what I mean
Just like Marvel vs Capcom, there hasn't been one in like
Ten years, so
Anyhow, he says that he always
Tries to talk about Dark Stalkers in interviews
And he wants to show Capcom that there's a
Demand for a new game, he says quote
I am desperate to make this game
That's a pretty bold statement
So you know, flood
Capcom with your letters, you know when you're
Gonna send your hate mail about their DRM
You might want to just send some
Postcards to say, oh by the way, PS New Dark
Stalkers please
But don't screw it up with DRM, don't you dare
Let's see, also I think worth mentioning here
Sony is going to be discontinuing
The three and a half inch floppy disk in
Japan, aww
Memories, aww remember
Three and a half inch floppies, we were just
Talking about them last week
They were still making them
Yeah, they still make them, at least in Japan
I want a box of them, to make something out of
Can't you still get them
In like Office Max or something?
I can actually get them at school
Maybe Dollar Tree has it
Yeah, probably Dollar Tree
Nice, yeah well unfortunately
Sony has said that in 2011
There will be no more
Three and a half inch floppy disks
Available, they were first
Introduced in 1981
And really sold abroad in Japan in
1983, they had their
Peak in the year 2000, but
As you can probably imagine
Now that you have USB drives
And CDs
And other types of storage mediums
What ever happened to zip drives?
Remember zip drives are going to be like the next big thing
I still have like three zip disks around here somewhere
I have a zip drive
Or I had a zip drive
Remember the zip drive?
That's what I used to download stuff with
I make my portable drive
So there it is, bye bye, three and a half inch floppy
It's like when they got rid of the Polaroids
Man, remember when that happened
Alright, let's see
One other one, I'll give Tigerclaw one more
Story because I'm nice and he gave a lot
He also sent us a link to a story about
Early 3D games on PS3
Featured downgraded graphics
It's a story he linked us to
On Kotaku
Well that's a whole other thing we should get into
At some point tonight, did you hear about the whole
Gawker media who owns Kotaku
One of their other little
Websites, did you hear about this whole mess about the iPhone
That was found at the bar
That bought it for like five thousand dollars
Or something like that and leaked all the information on it
And now they want it back
Well they got it back
What a mess
In pieces, right?
They probably put it back together
But yeah, that was a
Sister blog to Kotaku
Yeah, I don't know
There's more I could say on it
I'm kind of getting to the point where I just don't care
It happened, whatever
Oh my god, fourth generation
iPhone, what?
I just think the way it all went
That is so surprising
The way it all went down was a little bit
I don't know the word, I think tacky
The one that really rubbed me
The wrong way was the story they ran on
The guy who lost it
You know
How would you like that to be you?
I think we've all had that stupid ass moment
Where we left something or forgot
And it might have been important, like it might have been school work
Or you know, shit, I left my
Coke on the top of the car
And then I drove off and it flew away
But your Coke is not a prototype device
Of a highly anticipated piece of electronic
I understand
But dude had a bonehead moment
And not that it makes it right
Hey guys, look what I brought with me
I'm so drunk
Does it necessitate him being splashed
All over this blog and all the details about his Facebook
And all this stuff? It's tacky
It's just tacky
Anyway
So tacky website sister reports
That there's
The PS3 apparently
Might have some downgraded graphics
I guess Wipeout HD
It usually will run in 1080p
Which is considered, you know, it's the Uber HD
It has to actually be scaled back to
720p to run in
3D
Motorstorm, it's top resolution with 720p
It actually has to be scaled back to less than that
Which would not even be considered HD
In order to run in HD
Okay, but
That's not true
No, less than that
It's basically pulling a halo
Where, you know, they just uprise everything
But it's not true
HD
Wasn't Sony the same company that marched out there and said
We have true HD
Yeah, just like all of our games are gonna be 1080p
Running at 120 frames per second
You know
Smoke goes towards my ass
You know
Um
It's not surprising that they're gonna have to cut down
The graphics a little bit
But I don't think you're gonna really notice when everything's
Flying towards you
Um
Obviously it's gonna take more processing power to
Display, you know
Those images
It's gonna have to refresh twice as fast
Whatever
I'm so over 3D
Like, fuck 3D, seriously
I'm over it
Like, now it's just like everything
Every fucking movie's in 3D
And every game's gonna be redone in 3D
3D this, 3D that, 3DS
Fuck 3D
Fuck it
Blue Swim
You're gonna get a 3DS
Maybe
We'll see
If it hurts my eyes, I don't know
Hey, I have one, it's called a Virtual Boy
And it gave me a migraine
That says, any thoughts on the new DDR game
Coming out for the 360 later this year
That features Coldplay and Jordan Sparks
And then links us to the thing
I thought this game was coming out last year
I thought that was gonna be last year's DDR game
What happened? It got delayed?
A year?
It's not a new DDR game, it's still that last one that hasn't come out yet
The one that was at last E3
It was just
They're like, we're just gonna call it Dance Dance Revolution
Cause that's not confusing at all
Blue Swim
It's really hard to say
Until we see the game in motion
I mean, I can look at the song list
And go, meh, whatever
But I really wanna see if they finally took the advice
Of, you know, just rebuild the game from the ground up
It sounds like they might have
Because it is supposed to have all these new modes and stuff
But I'm not gonna hold my breath, let me put it that way
I'm kinda over DDR
So it's gonna take a lot to bring me back
I know that's a sad thing for me to say
But I guess
Even a new BeatMania 2DX game was announced this week
And I was just kinda like, meh
Whoopee
Whoopee
Let's see
Dark Tetsuya sends us a tweet that says
I found this on the La Mulana WiiWare blog
It's an interesting article about religion in video games
Hmm
Alright, let's see what this is all about
I'm going into the
Blog here
I have to read this whole thing?
Come on, I'm not gonna read this whole thing on air
Okay, I guess I can read some of it
Again, this is the La Mulana blog
It has to do with religion in video games
One of the difficult things when Japanese make games
For foreign countries is the problems with faith
From the historical background of Japan
The interest in faith has been weak
It's difficult to understand the feeling of things
Such as making vows with a hand over the Bible
During the presidential inauguration
Or how Islamic faith views the absolute moral
This may be obvious when you look at how
Japanese games borrow names from monsters
And items from various beliefs, civilizations, and myths
Still more
La Mulana is further created with an
Absurd theme that its roots are from
All ancient civilizations around the world
Da da da
I'd like to briefly explain the view of faith in Japan
Japan is a civilization separated from the continent
And because the land is small
There are few open fields
Japan's people have prospered by officially obtaining food
As farmers
There are many earthquakes and because of few resources
There are only a few ruins created from large stones
I believe that the sense of not wasting
Came from utilizing the limited resources
In the faith born from within the continents
Culture exists a god
Even though there is a difference between monotheism
And polytheism, thinking about the many existing
Fears, living beyond a vast
Continent and harness of nature could have brought
Forth the absolute existence
Da da da goes on to talk about the
Do not waste philosophy and so on
Meaning there is no harm
Meant when Japanese games add elements
From the beliefs of foreign countries
And it can't just end there, so what's okay and what's bad
Needs to be thought out because there's no such rule
Existing, what's the best is to have the
World's religionist check but that would not
Be possible
So it's just kind of interesting to read this blog
Kind of talking about you know these guys
Having to consider this and all the development of
La Mulana when you know
It's maybe not such a big deal in some parts of the world
But they've got to be careful not to offend
Because everything's got to be politically correct
So
If you want to check that out
La-mulana.com
Slash en for the English one
And this is called
Problem of faith and I'll link it to you
Guys in the chat but those of you listening
To the podcast La-mulana
M-u-l-a-n-a dot com
Slash en for the English version
Okay last couple
Tweets here and then we got to close up the
Twitter Alex P. Carson
On Twitter says 364 episodes
Not bad you guys are my second
Favorite podcast
Second favorite
Second favorite
Want to guess who we lose to?
Dig Nation
I know
Rob's going to have a diva stomp
We're just going to have to try harder
But he says keep up the good work
No and all joking you know whatever
I can say I've never listened to an episode of that show
So I don't know maybe they're awesome and I just don't know
It's well Kevin
Yeah I know who's on it but does that make me care anymore?
No
Well because it's a translate thing
It's like a Google translate
Okay I hope that's all it is just because
It's just kerned badly
Well the Japanese it's developed by Japanese
Obviously so you know it's just
Probably run through the Google translate
Yeah and then
Spazinator sends a last tweet
Saying sorry I'm nixing the epic news
Oh well how do you
I know something you don't know never mind
Whatever
Let's move on with some more gaming news
Then we're going to get to our Skype line a little later in the show
1877 game OLR
Not yet we've got some more gaming news
Mailbag and all that fun stuff
Logie why don't you get us back to gaming news
Ah yes well
One of the things that was announced
I want to say Tokyo Game Show
Wow Mac was that
For Dead Rising 2 they're going to be
Doing some sort of
Different things
Other than the last game of course
One of them being co-op in the game
And in fact they are
Going to allow you to play through the entire
Single player campaign with
Another person
Which is awesome
And really the way they should have done it in the first place
Um
And then also
Let's see here
Oh great and then that disappeared
For some reason go Comcast
Um
Now the other player that you play
As I'm not sure if it's um
I guess it's a clone of your own character
I mean they're both Chuck Green
Not some other character
That you play as but um
It's going to be pretty awesome and they're
Going to have some different mini games you can play as well
Um
I want to say there's like card playing
And
Different events and stuff that you can do
But hey
That's pretty sweet that they're going to have something other than
Just like that Deathmatch
American gladiator-esque
Mode in the game
Yeah I got to admit co-op sounds kind of rad
So I'm looking forward to that
Yeah so um
One of the other things I saw too
Um
Was that they were talking a little bit about
The
Demo slash prequel game
That they're going to be putting out
Um the
I want to say what was it called
I can't remember
Anyways um
That should be coming out
Pretty soon I would think because I think
Dead Rising 2 if I remember correctly
Is scheduled for August right now
Well
Right now but you know we just heard
About a bunch of other games getting pushed back
So maybe these games will get pushed back too
Yeah
Maybe but Capcom usually doesn't move stuff around too much
We'll see what happens
God I just can't wait to play the game though
Yeah the more and more
I'm hearing about it the more it sounds kind of awesome
Even if Frank West isn't in it after all
Well
It would be funny if he made a cameo
I mean you never know
They're saying that he's not in it now
But I mean
You know
Might be funny if he has some big role in it
Or something later on
Well a new trailer also was released
Out of the Capcom press event that was pretty much
Already spoiled on last week's show
One of the things that came out was a trailer
For Bionic Commando Re-Arm 2
Oh awesome
And there's that little
That's right
It's redesigned and it's rebuilt
And I guess the big thing now is that
He can actually like jump
Now
Well that takes up the point
Yeah so now he can jump and use the arm
So there it is
That's the big change in Bionic Commando
Re-Arm 2
It will be on Playstation Network and Xbox Live
The first quarter of 2011
New weapons, attacks and all that
Fun stuff
It's being developed by Fat Shark
Because you know Grin did the first one right
And they're not there anymore
New physics based puzzles
There will actually be a two player co-op in this game as well
New graphics, new score
But it will be inspired by NES
Which kind of brings me back to
What makes this game very interesting in the first place
Bionic Commando Re-Armed was an upgrade
Of an actual NES game that existed
Called Bionic Commando
So this is a sequel to a
Retro remake
That isn't based off anything
Isn't that weird?
I don't know if it's not based off anything
Some of the stuff reminded me of the arcade game
Of Bionic Commando
Wasn't there a rumored sequel in development too
That just didn't end up happening
I want to say I'd read a while ago that there was a rumored
Sequel in development so maybe some of this is bits and pieces
But still the point remains
You have a sequel to a retro game
That doesn't actually exist
Which I find very interesting
In a way
But it's still got that same art style and everything
And despite the jumping
Kind of being
Huh? For Bionic Commando
I guess it could be cool
And remember how I was saying too
About the release date
For Dead Rising 2
They're also showing as August 31st
On
I guess this is news coming from
X10
Hmm
Just in time for the end of
Summer and Labor Day. Good stuff
Alright
Anyway that's Bionic Commando re-armed too
And look for more news on that
As we get closer to the first half of 2011
Dark Soccer
Well
This is some good news and actually the screen
Capture is in French
But there is a
Screen capture that was submitted
That shows a particular game
For Xbox Live Arcade
And that would be Jet Set Radio
Um
It could be
It could not be. It could have just been a
Place holder by someone wanting to
You know cause
Sonic 4 Episode 1 is on the list
And you know
But other stuff like Quake Arena arcades
You know Clash. That's real. Yeah
So it's real? Yeah it's real. It's off of
That's the
Partner net stuff
Some of which has already been leaking online
And they're cracking down on it pretty big
Yeah I was like it's in French
No it's the same guys
That released information
Well I'm not sure if it's the same person but
Those same games were on
Had screenshots leaked out because someone has a
Dev kit that they bought
And they're releasing a bunch of screenshots
And stuff from games that haven't been
Announced yet or aren't released yet
And stuff like that and then
A few of them they actually leaked out the full
Games out there
So
Yeah but
People keep going ok
Release
Sonic 4 come on come on
You know you want it and they're like no because
They're cracking down on it and now they're password protecting
A bunch of this stuff and
They don't like that too much
Well I mean I can imagine
But well yeah it's not meant for that kind of stuff
Um
Dev kits getting
Sold to
Random people
Aren't those things expensive aren't they like ten thousand dollars
To get one of those kits? No
No cheaper than that? A lot less than that
Really? Yeah
How much would it cost for me to get one?
A dev kit? About a thousand bucks
I want a dev kit
A thousand bucks I'm not sure if that includes
The ability to log into Partner net or not
Um
I don't know what exactly that takes but
You can find them
But you know now that there's JTAG
Consoles out there you don't really need dev kits anymore
Yeah but a JTAG console
Can't get on Partner net and get all the details
About games that are coming out you know what I mean? That's true
But there's other people that can do that for you
Alright
Um
Let's move on with some more news
Loki
Ah yes um
Now there's some other interesting
Stuff um coming out from
The Captivate stuff
Including you know these are some
Games that I believe were already out in
Japan that are making their way out over here
Um Okameden
Is coming out on the DS
Later this year or actually I'm sorry
Uh 2011
And of course that's the sequel to Okami
Um
And it looks pretty awesome
And then of course um
You mean Legend of
Okami? Legend of Okami
Alright
And then um
From the same I'm not sure
If it's the creators of the
Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney
Series but at least the same
Artists um they're releasing Ghost
Trick Phantom Detective
Um that's going to be a brand new series
And that's supposed to be making its way out
Later this year
And then oddly enough on the Wii and
The PS3 Sengoku
Basara Samurai Heroes is making
Its way out and I believe that's supposed to be
Later this year
Um
And that one uh came out
Well one of the games in the
Series came out on the Playstation 2
A couple of years back um
Which was uh
God I just had the name
Devil uh
Devil Hunter I think
I
I don't remember but I thought that was the
Name of the series that came out over
Here it's basically like uh
Dynasty Warriors
Both guns
Cool guns
Yeah not really though I hate guns
They've had um
At least one other Sengoku Basara game
That was um
Basara I guess game that was on
The Wii
A while back I want to say it was the first
Second year the Wii was out
But they're okay they're kind of cool
I don't know
I just wish they was on the 360 too
I just don't understand why they hate
Unless it's going to be coming out
At a time when they do have the motion controller
In play and it's
Going to be something with that and then maybe I can
Understand why it's on the Wii and the PS3
Other than that it's just hating
They're just hateful
Why they hate?
Don't hate the play I hate the game
Anyhow
This is a game that I
Tried to like but it kind of
Drove me bonkers but we had a little tidbit
On it last week it's the Lord of Ultima
And it was actually released this week
Yay it was launched and you can actually
Play it and have fun with it
You have to visit the website which was
I think it was like lordofultima.com
You can actually go and play the game
I tried to play it and it crashed on me
During the tutorial
So uh yeah
But apparently in this game you will
Set up your own little kingdom and there's little micro
Transactions and stuff I don't know it sounds
A little Farmville to me but with Ultima
And you know better
Graphics and all that stuff but I tried to
Play it I wanted to review it for you guys but it crashed
During the tutorial so I guess I'll have to try again this week
Is any of our listeners playing? Chatters does anyone
Try Lord of Ultima that came out this week?
Anybody?
Maybe we can have a guild?
Or a kingdom or
Something?
I don't know. Alright let's get to the part of the show
Where you guys get to write us and have your say
It's our mailbag segment
Mailbag
At orangelandradio.com is the place to send
Those emails. DarkSakura
Who's emailing us this week?
Two people
We're drowning in letters
Redertainment
Dear OLR I sent you
A Twitter topic last week asking why
Activision had not set up their own bank
I was not joking about that
I was in fact serious
What got me thinking was
About this was Walmart's effort to create their own bank
They wanted to lower the prices
Of check and credit card processing by
Cutting out the middle man in this process
Walmart wanted to establish this bank
In the mediocre state of Utah
Which is how I came to learn about it
Ultimately the banking lobbies in Utah put the kibosh
On this deal and the effort
Ultimately died
Activists establishing their own bank assembly lowered
Processing fees for people playing wow
And also act as an additional
Revenue stream for Activision as if they
Need another
I'm not saying this would be good for the consumer
The bank of Activision would inevitably
Church bank customers out the ass for bank fees
Jack up interest rates on loans and quickly foreclose
On the homes of people who were delinquent on payments
These deplorable practices
Would happen because Activision seems only interested
In squeezing all the cash they can
Out of consumers and not serving their customers
Well like most major banks do today
I'm not going to say anything
I work in the mortgage industry
So is there a legal reason why Activision
Has not established their own bank
Or is this whole rant evidence
Of my low opinion of the banking industry
In America and of Activision
Stay care of entertainment
This message is brought to you by the Burns Cafe
In Taylorsville, Utah where thanks to their choice
And the meat they serve you can literally bite an ass
Well it's a bummer you couldn't fit that
In 140 characters or less
Or the tweet might have made more sense at the time
Ok I get your joke now lol
I don't know, Activision is not going to set up a bank
Like they care
I get the point you're trying to make
But come on
It's cute though
Your email was cute
Your thought is cute I like that
Oh this is one we've been included on
How nice
From Brandon
Dear C4 and OLR crew
I got DDR U3
With a soft pad
And I want some modding help
To make it a hard pad
I want to know why you hate or have not played
Beat and Groovy
That's up to you Rob
In my mind it was Pop'n Music for the 360
As far as superior
God please spell
Than Pop'n on the Wii
I have a suggestion for Konami
If they are going to do Pop'n Music Wii V2
They should take the normal Pop'n controller
And have a slot in it for the Wii remote
Oh God please
This is just awful
I'm looking for some fun RPGs for the 360 help
That's literally how it said
I am looking for fun RPGs
For the 360 help
Was this typed on an iPhone?
I can type better than this on an iPhone Rob
And besides that iPhones
Auto capitalize and fix your spelling
Whoever accepted my PA challenge
Should know
That I only have
SM and DDR US3
And I am looking for an online
Challenge on Live since the
Hourly DS Master 26
PS I want to find a cop
That explains a lot
It's with two Ps
Of Disney Mix for PS1 and Golden Eye Clone for today's
Consoles
I have Disney Mix, I have both of them
I have the Japanese one and the US one and you can't have it
Oops, the FU's music
How appropriate that the FU's music accidentally
Starts playing
I didn't do that intentionally I swear
God there was like five questions in that email
What was the first question?
I just stopped paying attention
I was just reading the words
Can you go back and look for me?
I closed it
SSJ100Matt said that this email
Fails too many fucking ways
Okay
You want to know how to mod a soft pad
Look online
The way that I know how to do it
Duct tape it to a piece of plywood
Seriously? It works?
Oh yeah, packaging tape
Do not do the sheet of plastic over it
Because you'll fall
I'm sorry, not that
You need to get a clear linoleum
Or whatever and you put that over the top
And then you staple it through the bottom
With a staple gun
But yes, look online
You can also use a power drill
And screws
Although he'd probably screw his foot
I think
Because he wouldn't be able to read the instructions
DS Master's just not allowed to
Email us unless it's been
Spell checked and grammar checked
Well, you know, Bobby's in chat and says
You know he does this on purpose, right?
The only way to stop it is to not even bother
That's what I did, don't give him the attention
That's actually what I was just about to say
I'm going to stop reading emails from him
Unless they're typed properly
That's fair
You need to have somebody proofread it
And then we might read them
Might!
RPGs on the 360
Final Fantasy 13
Is good
I guess a lot of people like to
Even though I did not
Okay, whatever
Lost Odyssey, yes, thank you
Blue Dragon's okay
I love Blue Dragon
Bite my butt
I will give Blue Dragon this
If you liked the Super Nintendo RPGs
It's very retro-esque
Blue Dragon should have just been on the Super Nintendo
Blue Dragon reminds me of playing a Dreamcast RPG
End of story
It's like playing Evolution
Oh, I remember the other one
I was like, what the hell are you smoking?
Beat and Groovy, it's just not a good game
Beat and Groovy is unfinished
It's an unfinished pile of poop
That Konami put on the arcade
That honestly Microsoft should have rejected
Like, it's a horrible
Abortion of a game
It's literally, I'm not saying that to be
It is literally an abortion
It was stopped
Halfway through it was actually finished
And put on the marketplace
You have like up to nine star
Difficulties on songs that are never used
There's no song on there that's harder than like
A five star difficulty
The song list is laughable
There was no download content or anything
Released, it is a bad
Unfinished, aborted game
Beat and Groovy
Do not buy it, I'm not even
Kidding, don't support that crap
I'm gonna put out another pop of music
Cause I'm guessing one, the Wii one
Did not sell very well
Two, Konami doesn't really
Get the Wii and stuff
Other than rehashing DDR
And putting stuff out there
And adding some waggle crap to it
I mean, that's really the most
Effort you get from Konami
With some of these games
So no, they're not gonna spend the time
To make a peripheral for pop of music
Because it just will never catch on over here
I'll say this, at least the game had a couple
Okay songs, like the song list
Wasn't completely fail, but
I'm sorry, you know, you put a
Poop in sparkly, pretty packaging
And it's still poop
Pop of music is very niche
In Japan, so
Why would you bring something that's
Incredibly
Niche over here
Just fucking fail at it
I understand wanting to bring the niche thing over here
If you do a good job with it
That, I mean, was set up for
Failure from the beginning
Honestly, I'm throwing this out here
Whoever is responsible for that game
Should have been fired
Like, I'm not even kidding, whoever was responsible for that
Fire them
That was
Unexcusable, that game
Period
Alright
What are you giggling at over there, Dark Sakura?
Are you even paying attention
To the show?
I just was distracted by something
And I found a link to a product
Called HanderPants
Underpants for your hands
HanderPants?
Why on earth would you need HanderPants?
I don't know
I just think it's funny
They're fingerless gloves
With the design of underwear
I'm gonna link it into the chatroom
Jesus
This is the same vein as Mantis
And then you go up to somebody
And you're like, look at my Mantis pants
Look at my HanderPants
I don't care
Really, I don't
Look at my Mantis
Your Mantis?
What?
It's a real website, Mantis.com
I know, I'm sure it is
But see, there's people that are into that
But like, HanderPants, that
I don't understand
There's some guys that wanna
You know, the
Sorry, Sakura
Why are you doing this?
I
I am so easily distracted
today. Oh, it's not funny
Mantis
SSJ100Matt says this topic sounds
Automatically better than dsmaster's email
You know what's funny? We didn't even finish with his
Email, we just went right on to talking about Mantis
And I'm enjoying myself more than I was
Five minutes ago
Just
You know what?
I think that should be the rule from now on
The rule
No, I have it
I have a new OLR rule
Could you please get out the stone tablets
And get out the chisel
Cause they're gonna write a new rule
When you send us a question
To the mailbag
And it is so horribly tight
And grammar
Look, if you make a couple mistakes here and there
I'm not the best with spelling and grammar either
But at least if you put out an effort, we're not gonna laugh at you
At least you're consistent
If you just have a
Horrible email that you didn't even bother
To try with and you typed it like it was a
Text message on the cell phone
We are going to answer your question
With Mantis.net
Is the website you need to go
To fix your problem
From now on
Or possibly hand or pants
When you send us a question that stinks
Mantis.net is where you need
To go to find your answer
Try the high cut ones
Put that on the wiki
It's an official rule
Alright
Hey, whoever updates their wiki, add it
Let's go to the
I like
Game suggestion
RPG 360
Well email her, I think you'll find the answer
At Mantis.net
Alright
Speaking of which
These things have flies
Rob, they do have
Embroidered briefs
You're telling me this like I would want to suddenly
Go over them? I don't want you to get any
I'm just saying that they're funny
Let's get to the FUs
FU to
DS Masters email
And now you know what
I think the rule is just I'm just not answering any more
From them, ever
Lowkey
FU to bad drivers
Two types in particular
One, the person that
Decides hey you know it's going to be a great idea
To stop four car lengths before the car
That's in front of them
Making it near impossible to go around them
Or the fact that they go really slow
To accelerate once the light does change
And then two
The more dangerous type, the people that run
Stop signs and run stop lights
They're there
For safety and the fact that you
Just blow right through them like you don't give
A shit, that's how people die
So, stop it
Cause I don't want to die
Um, I'm sorry I'm laughing too hard
Cause I'm looking at this website
I don't really have a lot of FUs
Of the week
Actually I had a pretty good week
I really don't think I had a lot of bad things
Happen, I guess FU to those work
Days that start at 6 AM
Cause getting up at 5 o'clock to go to work
Kinda stinks, but at least the days go by fast
So, even that's not really a complaint
Alright, let's get to some more
Gaming news and then
We'll open up the skype line at 1877
Game OLR and who knows
What phone calls we might get tonight
Uh, Lowkey
Yes, so you know
The whole drama with Infinity Ward
And Activision is just nuts
Activision, they've hired
A person to, I guess
Run their community forum
Or whatever, Dan
Amrich
And I guess they have a Facebook
Cause everybody does
And he's basically
Trying to give their side
I guess of the whole bonus situation
For Infinity Ward
Um, he says
Vince and Jason had very
Large bonuses, those bonuses are being
Redistributed to everyone else
To people who did not allegedly
Attempt to steal company secrets
Activision
Is not pocketing the bonus money
It's still going to the people who
Work at Infinity Ward
But you have to work at Infinity
Ward to get it
See, I don't want
To see talented people screwed out
Of a paycheck any more than you do
So are they trying to be all like
Hey, we're the good guys, we're gonna pay out those bonuses
No, we're gonna pay them, we're gonna pay them
Don't worry, they're getting a bigger share of the bonus
Well, why don't you pay their bonuses in the first place
Because that was the whole problem
You weren't paying the bonuses
What, the game's been out for
Almost
Six months now?
What's it like to get a bonus?
Isn't it time to get the bonuses
Out there?
I thought bonuses were just that, a bonus
Allegedly, why didn't you even put the allegedly
Attempt to steal company secrets
They're the ones that made the game
I think all their secrets are in their head
They don't need to steal anything
He's just a douche
You know, unfortunately
He's sub douche, you know, to the major douche
Which
Why even bother having a community?
I think this is the same guy I want to say
Like, why do you hate Activision
Or whatever, we want your honest answers
Or something like that
It's like, really, you don't know why we don't like you
I mean, really, you have to ask
That's like my wife
You know, if like, she's mad at me
And I'm like, what are you mad at me for?
And she's like, really, you don't know
That just makes me even more pissed off
It's because we expect our spouses to be
Psychic when we're psychotic
I'm letting the secret out of the bag
Ooh, you're gonna get nasty emails from the women of America?
I'm a chick!
The women of America don't listen to our show
I can get away with saying this
Because it's exactly what I pull with my husband
Wait, Dan, you didn't hear that?
Uh, yeah
It says, uh, although it's unclear
Whether the Romanian Infinity War
Employees have received their personal bonuses
For Modern Warfare 2 yet
Activision lawsuit claims that
Zampanelli and Wes
Allocated to, or, and Wes
Allocated to themselves approximately
One third of the total bonus pool
For the Call of Duty franchise bonuses
Which included
The first Modern Warfare game
Further, it contends that Wes and
Zampella, um
Were demanding an even larger
Share of the bonus pool for Modern Warfare 2
Oh, so now
We're seeing that they're getting too big bonus
Or too much of a bonus or whatever
If they wanted too much of a bonus
Well, that's too bad that they got fired
So that really doesn't make any sense
Uh, and
No word on when this whole thing
Is gonna be taken care of, but
They're thinking that more people are gonna leave
So, uh
Oh, and they have a big ol' quote for
Activision's countersuit, which I don't really feel like
Reading, cause it's just a bunch of
Crap
In my opinion
Ipsofacto
Sue
Money
Let's move on then, shall we?
One more story for you guys, then I guess we'll open up
The skyfly and see what happens
Could be a fun time tonight
877 Game OLR
Oh, I forgot to mention real quick
This kind of goes along with this story, but
It is apparently rumored
Or, I don't know if it's confirmed or rumored
But, uh, they're saying that
Modern Warfare 2 games are gonna be out
Uh, by 2011
Or, 3, not Modern Warfare
Uh, 3 Call of Duty
Games will be out
Good luck, guys
Good luck. Well, these other games
Might be out soon. It's more website
Leaks. Remember earlier in the show we had a
News about Farmville and some apparent
Websites that were being registered that gave away Farmville
On other platforms. Well, something similar is kinda
Happening, but it has to do with some different games
Like games that people actually play
Here's the interesting thing
The URLs were registered for
Bloodstonegame.com
Was registered Wednesday, and of course
Bloodstone is supposed to be the next Bond game
That's like the rumors that's coming out
But you know what also was registered?
Goldeneyegame.com
Hmm
Could this be, I don't know
Something where, you know, there was rumors before
There might be a Wii version of GoldenEye coming out
Or something. Who knows?
Uh, which is strange because I could've sworn
I said before, it's not fucking happening
Shut up
But you know, where there's a will, there's a way
Also, apparently a game that was discovered
DriverSanFranciscogame.com
Was registered by
Ubisoft
Uh, it's by Ubisoft
Yeah, I don't know
Well, but didn't Atari
Sell it off tonight? Yeah, that's right
So, there you go. That's too bad
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.com
And LaserHomeBattleground.com
What the hell is that? LaserHomeBattleground?
Sounds like laser tag
Where's LaserCatsBattleground.com?
That's the game
I would've given that top of the news
Reporting. Oh, that's easy
You just put a cat stuffed animal
On top of the laser gun
Alright
Supposedly, Assassin's Creed is gonna have another
Sequel in 2011 anyway, so maybe that's the
Subtitle of the game, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
Who knows?
Brotherhood? Yeah
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.com
Was just registered. Uh, sounds like
Um, another
PSP game
That could be too, who knows? I'm going to the website right now
And a time's out. I guess you have to look up the registry
Info. There's no forwarding
Happening just yet
Alright guys, this is part of the show
Where we're gonna open up the Skype line and take your
Calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR
Or our username on Skype is
OrangeLoungeRadio. If you're gonna call us on Skype
That's great, the quality's really good on Skype
But we do encourage you to call
Echo123 on Skype
Or I think in the newer versions of Skype
You click a button that says test call
Or something, and you can test your configuration
First, I really urge you to
Do that, or I'm going to make fun of you
When your call stinks
OrangeLoungeRadio is the place to call on
Skype. Whatever you want to talk about
Tonight's show, go ahead
Say your piece, have a voice
While we wait for calls
Cause it takes about a minute for me to say something
And the listeners actually hear it with the encoding and everything
Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
Yes, apparently
There is a new game coming out
From Bayer
I guess, it's called
Knock Em Down's World's Fair
And apparently it's a device
That, or it comes with a device
That you use to check your blood glucose
Level, and you can play the game that way
That's funny, that's one of the other Tiger Claw
Stories from the Twitter, but I just
He sent so many, I had to pick and choose
One of you brought it up too
I thought I remembered hearing that this game was in development before
Like I wanted to say some time ago
I heard that there was a DS game in development
That was using like medical stuff
Yeah, I can't imagine though that this would be too
Popular, I mean it seems like a very
Narrow market that they'd be, you know
Well, yes, you're right
But, I mean for that market
I think it could actually be really cool
Cause you know there's a lot of tweens and teenagers
That get diagnosed with diabetes at a very
Young age, and this could be an interesting
Way to teach them kind of the management of that
Cause you know you have to alter your diet, take your blood
Glucose, know what it means, you know there's a lot
That goes with it, it's not just like, hey you have
Diabetes, you know there's a lot of things
That go with it, so I actually
Think, even though yeah you're right, it's a niche thing
It's kind of neat
It is
But I'm sure it will sell the particular products
You know, it's
Monitors and stuff for what, $200
A pop, and then you have to buy test strips
I mean I know your insurance usually
Covers that stuff, but you still have some choices
On what brands you get
It's still pretty crazy, I have
A number of friends who have to monitor
Yeah, especially if you're
The type 1
Yeah, there's different stages of it
Sometimes you can be diabetic, but you don't actually
Have to test anything, but you still
Well you still have to watch it, or I guess you could slip
Into one of the other types
Well, you typically adult onset, I believe
That's type 2
Yeah, my grandma had it
So, it was unfortunate
I don't know why
You know what, I upgraded the version of Skype
So I'm almost worried that the calls aren't coming through
So I'm just gonna make sure
Well Bobby's call came through
Yeah it's true, Bobby's call came through, so that should work
I'm just calling the 877 number to make sure everything's okay
Where are you people?
I know, it's kind of weird, we're not getting any calls tonight
Usually it's flooded with people
I guess they're worried about the threats of sending people
To mantis.net, I don't know
Well I've got some more last minute stories
Alright, let's hear it
MacWarrior 4, there was that whole
Kind of delay
They were gonna release the game free
To play over the web
And it was being held up by
Microsoft, now it's finally been cleared
So there will be coming
Coming soon, there will be a brand new
Port of MacWarrior 4
That you'll be able to play
For free, over the internet, through a web browser
Isn't that exciting?
Mad Catz is apparently now gonna be making
All the principal peripherals
For Rock Band
Basically that means
All the peripherals that come with
Say Rock Band 3
Or any future releases
Going forth
Will be made by Mad Catz
And not by EA or whoever the hell they had
Making their peripherals
And yeah I know Mad Catz peripherals
At one time really suck
But to be honest I kind of like their
Guitar at least
I have the bass and
I dig that, it's pretty cool
Does it wear out like
The fucking
Rock Band, just regular guitar they have
Guess what, we got a call
Awesome
Hi, you're on Orange Zon's radio, who's this?
Hi, this is Amiga777
Amiga777
I love the Amiga, what's up?
Just testing the streams
To make sure that the calls
Are going through for you
That's pretty much it
AOK works great
Thanks
Wait wait wait, you're not gonna
He just hung up
Ah yes
Just confirm me it's not your stream
We just don't want to talk to you
This is just a courtesy call
Just checking
That's right, everything's fine guys
No worries, you're good
Oh that's funny
Oh right, whatever
Here's someone that we haven't heard from
That's one of my favorite phone calls
I've ever got, just so you know
Alright, here's someone we haven't heard from
In a while, actually two years
To be exact
Surfer Girl is back with a new rumor
Regarding the slim
Xbox 360
She says it's gonna be unveiled at E3
They're gonna rebrand the Xbox 360
As well
Apparently
The review will happen
Some 360
Natal bundle will happen at one of the
Two Yes2
Press conferences at this year's E3
What's more is the 360 will be
Getting a subtle rebrand
With a new logo and black is the new
Primary color for the console
They feel that the new system needs to be black
Because a white Natal
Wouldn't sit well against the typical
Gloss black TV
The new system design is pretty neat
And Natal, let's just say
You're gonna be very surprised and very pleased
By one of the games being revealed
What is it?
And then of course, in bold
It says, might get shot
Or MGS
Perhaps a new Metal Gear Solid game
Alright, let's go to the phones
We have another test call coming in
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hey
Hi
Hello
Hello
Hey, DT, what's on your mind?
Hi, you're here
Turn down the speakers on the computer
Because then you get all confused
So what's up? What's on your mind, buddy?
Plug in the
I know it's a monthly
Plug in the WonderCon
Article
That's right, WonderCon, you got to go to WonderCon
A couple weeks ago and you wrote a nice little article
About it that's on the website
That's cool, how did you
How did you enjoy things at WonderCon?
Did you have a good time overall?
Oh god, yeah
First stop was at a
Capcom booth, they were showing
Final Fight and Super Street Fighter 4
And Plus Planet 2, actually
You know, I actually read
The article, believe it or not
And I heard you scored a soundtrack
At the booth, what'd you get there?
Actually, that was just posted online
What I got was a couple
Yeah, no, you're right, I thought the
Rockman 9 soundtrack
Nice
I like how you call it Rockman 9
And not Mega Man 9, was it actually the Japanese
Version?
Yeah, it was
No, that's cool, very cool
It's interesting, though, that you were at
See, this kind of blows me away
Even though I know it was a few weeks ago you went to
WonderCon at this point, so for some people
This does strike me as interesting
Capcom had to know
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was
Happening when they did WonderCon
But yet, they didn't say anything
At what you would otherwise
Think is a really freaking
Logical place to announce a game like
Marvel vs. Capcom 3
And yet, not a peep, right?
I know
They talked about being at future
Comic Cons and whatnot
With that
I guess WonderCon just wasn't good enough, sad cry
Upset
But hey, there's
BayCon coming up
I think is a big sci-fi nerdy con
I don't know if there will be a lot of video games of that
But I know I had some friends talking about that
Memorial Day weekend, and of course, Fonome
Memorial Day weekend is always a big con weekend
So there's a lot of that coming up
Any cons in your future, otherwise?
I don't know
Probably just trying to go to
WonderCon next year
I know my brother was excited about that
He's really big into comics
That's cool, you gotta go to Comic Con
I've heard that the one that happens in San Diego
Is epic, I would love to go someday
But I just don't know if I'm gonna make it
That's weird
It wouldn't surprise me at all, with all the stars
And everything to go, I'll have to plan for 2011
Or something
Well, Darktotu, Darktotu, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
Well
Yeah, no, I know
I heard some
footage got stolen at the Super Street Fighter
4 launch event
I don't know if he talked about that
We didn't, what did you hear about this?
I vaguely remember seeing an article on this
What's up, what's going on?
I don't know, I guess someone stole a bunch of stuff
But the Super Street Fighter launch event
Like, footage of
the different players and all of that
And a MacBook
So they want to know who the hell
But the game's like, I don't get what the
advantage would be to stealing something like that
Like, the game is pretty much out now
They didn't steal anything regarding the game
They stole camera equipment
And SDI records
And a MacBook
It was that they wanted the computer equipment
It wasn't anything to do with what was on it
It was, uh, I am 8-bit
Oh, that's stinky
How did a thief get into an event like that?
That's terrible
Well, you see the people that play Street Fighter
Oh, stop it! I play Street Fighter, you ass
But yeah, there are some shady people that play
Street Fighter, just saying
But that dates back to 1992
So, well
There's shady people that play anything
That's very true
Dark Tetsuya, thieves suck and they should be laughed at
And taunted
And made fun of
And that's why we're here
Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, thanks so much for the phone call
We're gonna let you go to see if, you know, anyone else
by chance, you know, we want to free up the phone line
of those floods of calls that are coming in tonight
Alright, you take care
And thanks for all you do for OLR, we appreciate it
Take care
Yeah, no problem
The fine Dark Tetsuya, who really tries to actually
put content on orangeontraded.com
Nice guy
Tigerclaw says they don't care about the equipment
All they care about is getting the footage
Tigerclaw says they recorded footage of the event
Yeah, they just want the footage back
That's just messed up
Thieves suck
Alright, what else you got, Loki?
Anything else?
Just some last minute stuff here
There's another little big
Or, I guess, a little big planet
PSP download content pack
that's gonna be coming out called the Turbo Pack
And it's gonna feature some
new
stock car racing inspired tracks
and vehicles
And also they're gonna have
I guess some construction based vehicles
as well that are gonna be available
such as forklifts, cranes, and cement mixers
So that's kinda neat
Unbound Saga
which was kind of a comic-based
beat-em-up game that was on the
PSP is now making its way
to Xbox Live Arcade
Kind of a little bit like Comic Zone, I guess
PSP one is kinda
alright, I guess
But that'll be coming out a little bit later on
this year
Asia is getting
a limited edition Final Fantasy
13 controller
with the silkscreen of lightning on it
I guess to go with your Final Fantasy
13 lightning
PS3. Why that wasn't
included with the PS3 is beyond
me, but whatever
I guess, you know, opportunity to sell it twice
And then
Lastly
just a little bit of elaboration on a story
we had earlier talking about delays
from Nintendo, kind of as
I thought, different things
It's taken a little bit longer to get the
development for Metroid Other M done
because they're working with a third party company
on it
That's why it's been delayed to August 31st
And then of course Sin and Punishment
Star Successor is just basically to fill the
space
because it was originally going to come out at the beginning of the month
And they did their excuses
Well we just want you to have some more time to play
Super Mario Galaxy 2
So, that is it
Alright
Well, I don't know what's up
Something's in the water
Come on people! Ron Sean, call us
No, I closed Skype
One last thing also, forgot
This might be the next Yaris
Apparently, Audi is releasing
a free rhythm based driving game
for the iPhone
Oh goody
No more to say there
Well, I don't know
I guess, you know, it's okay
Some weeks, you know, in all things considered
it was a bit of a slow news week
of sorts, you know, a lot of the stories we had
tonight weren't like huge things
I mean a lot of stories were confirmations of things that were spoiled
last week and you know
It really does, but where's the love?
Where's the love?
I could use the extra time tonight to
take care of some things before work tomorrow
I'm sure we all could so
I think we're going to wrap it up, believe it or not
A little bit of a shorter show tonight, but that's okay
Again, it just wasn't a huge
huge week for news
It was like a bunch of Capcom news
We already knew that
Of course, you know, it's going to be like this for a few weeks
because E3 is on the horizon
so outside of your E3 leaks
May is going to be a bit of a slow month
If I'd known
we would have planned a game or something for tonight
So you know what that means next week
if it's a slow news week again, we're going to have a game
or something
Or we might have an actual guest on the show
I know my friend Matt is dying to come back
He was here back when the show was still at my house
He's like, I really want to come back and hang with you guys
I'm like, okay
I'm sure Alan will be here in the next couple of weeks
He's loving coming to the show
So we'll have him at some point
BlackWolfInChat says
Okay, so let me get this straight
Rama calls my show for the first time ever
but doesn't call OLR
It's a weird night
It's okay
No, I closed Skype, I'm sorry guys
The moment's passed
The opportunity has passed
That's okay
I won't take it personally
He's just going to have a big diva stop
Send us some emails
mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com
and all that fun stuff
And see, I would love to
just do a game
pull a game out of the hat, but we don't have anything
That's okay guys, no seriously
I could stand to wrap up the show by 9 o'clock
and then go home and take care of some other stuff
So, we are out you guys
Let's go around
You know what you could do? What?
You should play the clip of Julian again
Because you know what? No phone call that we're even
going to get could possibly match
how disgustingly cute Julian is
in that clip
He's a cute kid
I'm telling you, this is going to be all the rage
at youtube.com slash users slash dark
sakura OLR
Dalek
What does a Dalek say?
Is that my night?
That's the cutest, and look at that expression
I know
One more time
One more time
What does a Dalek say?
Exterminate
I like how he even says it a little bit robotically
Exterminate
I love it
I wish I had grown up on a show like Doctor Who
That's kind of awesome
Did you? No, I didn't really, not me
Keep in mind
I was watching PBS a lot
when I was a kid
So Doctor Who came on PBS
So I started with like
fourth Doctor
Sarah Jane era
So she's always
going to be my favorite because she's who I remember
May Satsuma in chat says
Julian is smarter than DS Master
confirms
Julian is smarter than most
adults I know
I know, I'm serious
He's a smart kid
And he's a bit of a smart ass too
Just like his parents A little bit sassy?
A lot Okay, very cool
Alright
I didn't have Doctor Who to
grow up on though, you know what shows I watched growing up?
I watched Sesame Street
Of course, I mean god, who didn't watch Sesame Street?
And 321 Contact
And then later on
as I was getting older, Square One TV
Remember that show?
They need a show like that again
That's the one they used to play in a homeroom I think
They didn't play it at school
No, we had Channel One
Or something
They would pipe this
like pay cable show
into our homerooms every morning
and try to edumacate us
I just did my homework
The only show I remember watching
on like an early morning
TV thing at school was Kids Court
with Paul Provenza
I remember Kids Court
Remember that?
It was like Nick TV in the classroom or something like that
Good stuff
Alright, reminiscing is fun
but alas, the show must come to an end
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off tonight
Your final thought? I found Happy Tape
My final thought is
I see some yarn over on Dark Sakura's
bookshelf and it makes me think
I wish I was a cat so I could just play with that yarn
all day Yarn, yarn, yarn
The scarf of yours I still need to finish
You need to see the scarf I got yesterday
at a thrift store for a dollar
Yes, awesome
I was like a flaming gay fourth doctor
I really was
It was very short
Because it was for a twelve year old girl
and I bought it at a thrift store to wear to Rocky
Anyhow, but that's neither here nor there
Loki, your final thought tonight
I want to play more Just Cause 2
Hopefully this time the textures actually show up
so that I can see what I'm doing
because it's kind of hard when the whole map is see-through
or most of the map is see-through
Thank you guys so much
for downloading our show
listening to it live, supporting
independent podcasting, you guys are
awesome, I know I say that week after week
but if you think about it
next week, tomorrow, next week
is episode 365
of our show, that's one
for every day of the year
and that's a whole long time
and we just wouldn't have made it this long
if it wasn't for the support of you guys
just being here every week and saying
you guys are funny
so thank you guys so much
and all we ask if you enjoyed Orange Lawns Radio
just tell a friend
or two or five about Orange Lawns Radio
and what we do here
and just help us spread the word, that's really all we ask
because many of you have shared your tweets and Facebook messages
about how you've done that and trust me
we really do appreciate it because
we don't have money to take out advertising
or whatever
we have other podcasts, so hey, if you want a guest spot
just email one of us
I know I've gone on other shows
and I don't think Dark Soccer would be opposed to it
she had another show for a little while
and I don't think Loki's going to mind
it will be back, by the way, I did ask about it
there's just
graduations coming up
and someone being very busy
I've never asked to be on our show
I'm not surprised
Loki, you were on All Games Interactive
a couple times, I think
I had to do a toss over
there you go, alright
actually, and I do also want to
say, given that
graduation thing, by the way
it's Mar and Marvel
our own Tiara
congratulations in two months
absolutely, what's the major?
graphic design
good stuff, well hopefully she'll be back on the show
hopefully she'll be taking a graduation gift trip out here
but Loki, poor Loki
who has not been on any show
somebody needs to email Loki and get him on a show
that's alright
doesn't matter
alright, let's see
Amiga777 in chat says
I nominate Tommy T to be a guest
I'm assuming he means Tommy Tallarico
we had him on a couple of years ago
it was right before the Video Games Live
CD came out, it was about two years ago
he's fun, we'd have him back on the show
maybe after E3 and all that
that was a fun show, a fun concert though
oh yeah, they're doing it again
they're doing it again at E3 this year
I wish they'd do it in San Francisco again, hopefully we'll see
alright, that's it, we're done, we're wrapping up
we're out of here, thank you guys so much
again for your support, and what do you say we do it all again next week
sound good?
and no, it is not Episode Live 365
I've got nothing going on next week, sure
we don't speak about that
are they even around still?
I believe so
but they don't look any different, they did about four years ago when we left
alright, that's it, we're done, bye, good night
see you next week
