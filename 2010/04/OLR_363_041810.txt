Sky, and Loki Tonight, April 18th, 2010 PlayStation Network releases are on the move Does playing violent video games impact your sleep?
And how can you get free soundtracks from recent releases?
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 363 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Does it count if I only have half a voice?
You know, I just got this feeling coming in here tonight, DarkSakura, that you really weren't prepared for tonight's episode.
And that's okay.
We all have our off days.
But let me paint a picture for the listeners.
Just imagine, if you will.
You know, I get here to Jamie's house, and I usually get here about an hour before showtime, because we have to prep the intro and get the mixing board set up and all the things that have to happen to make a show work.
I wasn't naked.
No, you weren't naked.
Thank God.
Okay.
The minute I walk in the door and I start to kind of walk back towards the room, Jamie's like, oh, hold on a minute.
And she runs to the bathroom like she's the Flash.
Oh, do not.
She runs to the bathroom like the Flash and I'm like, oh, I guess she just had Taco Bell for lunch or something.
And she comes out and she's carrying something and she runs into a room and I'm like, what is going on?
And she's like, sorry, I just I didn't want you to see my unmentionables drawing in the bathroom.
Girl, please.
I've never seen a bra before.
I might be gay, but it doesn't mean that... But I am modest.
No, I know.
I'm a very modest person.
I may be immodest in personality, but I make up for it in personal modesty.
And she probably doesn't appreciate me telling that story on the air, but it's funny, and that's what's most important.
You're worse than my mother.
Alright.
Also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
Hello.
Thankfully I have not seen his unmentionables hanging up to dry, even though we lived together for a couple years.
He was very good about folding his laundry.
It's because we had a dryer.
And promptly putting it away, yes.
Okay.
You can't put a bra in the dryer.
It warps.
Exactly.
Didn't we learn anything from watching Hedwig?
No.
We put bras in the dryer all the time and it's just fine.
Yeah, you don't do it when you pay 50 bucks for them.
Alright, anyhow.
Alright Once in a while we talk about video games here on this program Not just drying bras But how was your week, Loki?
Tons of the young male demographic really want to know how to wash a bra It's important life skills You know what?
You know what?
Wait till you're married You know what?
You'll get a woman to sleep with you like that If you know how to do her laundry Seriously
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
So, it's a really large store.
Like, they have magazines on the first floor.
And, you know, you can get a copy of Famitsu there, manga, an entire Yaoi section, which is pretty impressive.
But they have some funny, like, English books upstairs, like gift gag books.
Like, one little section.
And one of the books I saw was Porn for Women.
And you open it up and it's just, like, pictures of guys, like, not, like, no, I mean, they're clothed and everything.
But it's, like, a guy holding a baby saying, like...
Gosh, why don't I take care of the child for an hour so you can go out to a movie or something?
Or vacuuming.
Yeah, a guy's vacuuming.
Half-naked vacuuming.
And you know what?
I don't really think that many of those guys are super attractive because they're too muscular, you know?
I like a...
I like a David Bowie.
You like him a little nerdy.
I like him a little androgynous.
All right.
All right.
Anyhow.
And I married Dan who was like so completely dude.
Yeah, Dan doesn't exactly strike this androgynous.
Dan's a bit of a broad.
Dan fights with me.
And you know what the song is, Break Up to Make Up?
No.
Well, hey-o.
Hey.
No, no, no, no.
All right.
Well, let's get into video games.
All right.
and start off the show as we usually do, not with a bra discussion or cherry blossom discussion.
For the record.
What?
It's a really comfy bra.
How was your gaming week?
Help.
Oh wait, I have to say this spiel about the chat room.
We do tape live every week on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com at 6 Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
If you are listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room.
If we haven't scared you off yet, congratulations.
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Jamie, how was your gaming week?
I did lots of gaming, Rob.
I've beaten Eskbaluga Whale 2.
Why do I want to add another syllable there?
Eskbaluda 2.
Twice on my iPhone.
It is amazing on the iPhone.
It is seriously easy to control.
Very, very, very, very, very, very overwhelmingly Japanese.
As in, they didn't bother translating it, just the text.
And in fact, the endings have a little bit of anguish in them.
I think it's hilarious.
And it's just fun.
It's really fun.
You have two modes with three difficulties.
I've just been playing in novice mode just to get used to it, of course.
So of course I beat it.
But in novice mode, you have auto-fire on, and you only have your, what is it, your enlightened attack or something?
And then you've got another thing open for regular mode, and then all of your selections open, including your fire on the other.
But really, I just like shooting stuff, and it's a gorgeous game.
It is gorgeous.
I've actually, on my Twitter, I've put a few, actually probably my last three TwitPic posts have been pictures of the game.
So it's pretty epic.
I find I've been really neglecting my Twitter these past couple weeks.
Like, I've just been very bad.
That's what happens when you're getting it.
Which is, no, it has nothing to do with that.
I think it has to do with the fact that I'm having, I mean, here's the thing.
There's a lot of great OLR listeners that follow me on Twitter and I want to share, especially like the gamey related things and, you know, funny life stories and little, you know, vignettes and little things.
I like that word.
Yes, vignettes.
It's a fun word to say.
Vignette in 140.
Is that the brand of your bra?
Vignette?
Vignette.
140 characters or less but here's the thing my bra is comfy I'm having a hard time justifying my continued existence and participation on a website where Justin Bieber is the number one topic of discussion every single day like I kind of feel like on moral grounds I kind of object
You know what, Rob?
I don't pay attention to that shit.
It makes life a lot better.
Whenever you go to Twitter.com, trending topics.
Justin Bieber!
Well, here's why.
It's because half the people are like, you know, fawning over him.
The other half are like, who's Justin Bieber?
I really don't know who that is anyway.
I don't look at the trending topics.
I still want to get President Cat as a trending topic.
We tried that a long time ago.
It got us a mention on some of the game blogs but it didn't get trending topics.
They're buttholes.
Love, love, love, love.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So I'm going to give it a plug because I can.
The temple that I go to here in Sacramento, or Orangevale technically, Temple Orishon is having a fundraiser, big, big fundraiser in the area on Sunday the 25th.
It's called All That Jazz.
Just look it up online.
Big fundraiser.
20s, 30s, 40s themed kind of roundabout.
And I'm doing their newsletter.
I'm doing a big newspaper for them as a giveaway to everyone who comes in, you know.
So that's what I've been tearing my hair out over and I was sick.
So if you're in the area, come share a lime with DarkSakura.
Spend a good 60 bucks and go.
It's a fundraiser.
It's for a good cause.
But as a result, I've had no life.
And I have been sick on top of it.
And I'm actually feeling a lot better today than I did.
My voice is coming and going.
But I've been sick.
So while I've been sick, I've been working on this.
So, yeah.
Tiger Claw in our chat room links us to a Wikipedia article on Justin Bieber because of course, Wiki will solve everything.
But let me put it in a nutshell.
You know what Donny Osmond was like 30 years ago?
He was so Mormon.
Oh, this guy's like... That's basically what Justin Bieber is now.
He has hat hair.
Anyway, please, no more Justin Bieber talk on this program.
He has hat hair.
And then Shaoran says, if you have that much of a problem with it, then maybe you should stop using Twitter.
Shaoran, that's exactly what's happened the past couple weeks.
I've been Facebooking, and now Foursquare is the other one I use, which I really shouldn't use.
I'm going to get posted on PleaseRobMe.com, but I'm kind of addicted to it.
I can't explain it.
It's partially a game.
They made a game out of social networking.
I don't know.
You know what?
I pretty much stick with my Facebook.
Look, at least I gave up Farmville, so I think I deserve props for that.
I'm trying to pay more attention to Twitter, because as I was telling you yesterday about my plan to become a true nothing celebrity...
You know, I want to be famous for absolutely nothing, like Paris Hilton.
Except I'm not going to put my twat on the internet.
But you have to be rich.
Well, that's what sponsorship's for.
Not necessarily.
Tila Tequila.
I mean, I look at her and I go, well, someone remind me why she's famous.
I could have eight babies at once.
But no, I'm going for Warhol famous.
I don't know.
I'm gonna finish working on my cork board.
I tried No More Heroes Paradise, or whatever the hell it's called in Japan.
It's the 360 port of No More Heroes, the game on the Wii.
and I gotta say, I like it better on the 360 than on the Wii.
It just seemed easier for me to control.
Granted, it's not as fun as slashing people to death, but it is still pretty cool the way you do a lot of the moves.
So in place of swinging the Wii remote, you actually use the...
Thank you for watching!
and you have the choice between English or Japanese dialogue.
The problem is they did not sync up the mouth movements to the English dialogue.
It's only synced up the Japanese dialogue and I mean it is way off for the English dialogue.
But it's a fun game overall and I mean I played the original on the Wii so it's kind of just rehashed stuff for me but I'm enjoying it quite a bit so hopefully I'll be able to play my way through that.
and then I played a little bit on the arcade cabinet broke out some Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Capcom vs. SNK 2 so that was pretty fun
I'm sorry to derail you for a minute, Loki, because I do love Capcom vs. SNK as well.
But I need to talk to Jamie for a minute.
Is that glue that you're putting down there?
Okay, Jamie's working on an art project.
Are you putting these pictures on the website?
Yeah, I'm going to do it on the website.
So Jamie's working on an art project during the show, which is fine.
But she's using a lot of glue.
And I want to remind the listeners, we're in kind of an enclosed space here in the studio.
It's not stinky glue.
So we're all currently inhaling glue during this show as if we weren't crazy enough.
Right now, check again in about 15 minutes and see if... I've got it right under my nose because I'm holding the damn mic.
Great, you of all people.
And for the record, the stuff that I'm using is Mod Podge.
And looks like a Yoplait yogurt container.
It does, a little bit, but not safe for you.
I was like, why are you rubbing yogurt on that?
It's so weird.
Alright, did you have anything else you wanted to say about your gaming week, Loki?
Um... No.
That's basically all I played this week.
I wanted to go back to Final Fantasy XIII, but I was talking to my friend who's actually at the same point in the game.
Actually, his wife already finished Final Fantasy XIII, and it's just kind of like...
It sounds annoying.
He's like, ah, the ending sucked, and you just put you back before the game's over, and you don't really get to see the results of your actions and that kind of stuff.
So I'm like, eh, that sounds kind of disappointing.
But I will finish it eventually so I don't have to play it anymore.
That's kind of sad, because X-2 had a freaking epic ending.
Yeah, I'm curious to see what the... Yeah, but you had to suffer through the whole game in order to see that ending.
I will say though, Final Fantasy related, speaking of like XI and all these other games, a lot of stuff is leaking out on XIV because the Alpha is going on right now.
So if you really know where to look, there's a lot of like videos and even the soundtrack.
And I wish I brought it to the show with me tonight, but unfortunately I don't have it.
I'll have to bring it next week.
Some of the soundtrack for the Alpha is leaked and it looks really good.
Magic Sword Double Impact Magic Sword Double Impact
I think actually they're selling it as another name.
I think like Final Fight or some other game nobody played.
But no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
Love Final Fight.
I just love Magic Sword more.
So I was very excited to hear that the game was being re-put out basically on Xbox Live.
What I really like that they did with it is that they didn't make it just a freaking dump of the ROM onto the marketplace with maybe some slightly enhanced graphics.
Now, sadly, there aren't really enhanced graphics.
You're not going to get Bionic Commando rearmed style graphics suddenly out of Final Fight or Magic Sword, but you do have different filters.
In fact, there's this one very interesting, the default mode that you play is...
It tries to make the screen look like an old arcade screen.
So like it has a curvature to it.
It's very interesting the way they do it.
It looks awesome.
I couldn't really play the game that way.
I had to just put it in normal ROM, no filter, just the way I remember it mode, which is nice because that's there.
So for the purists like me or whatever, elitists, whatever you want to call me, my mode is there.
So that makes me happy.
Remix soundtrack is there too.
I believe it was the same team that did,
Bionic Commando, don't quote me on that one of the other recent Capcom games did that so it has a remixed soundtrack and of course Magic Sword which I played mostly through the week was just as great as I remember it many years ago and if you've never played Magic Sword before well first I should say Final Fight it is the flagship game no matter if I think otherwise or not
Final Fight is one of those kind of beat-em-up type of games in the style of Double Dragon or Ninja Turtles.
But I think Final Fight was – or Streets of Rage, I guess, if you will.
But I think Final Fight was kind of known for just having somewhat more memorable characters and some memorable story.
And I think it was just kind of an iconic sort of arcade game that was out in the early 90s.
And I know DarkSakura, myself, and probably Loki all remember from kind of growing up in the pizza parlor and so forth.
Final Fight Collection Final Fight Guy
where you can have people, random people on the internet just drop in at any time like walk up to the machine, put in a quarter basically and drop into your game at any time a la Street Fighter 4, I guess you could say had a mode like that, but thankfully it's also very easy to turn that off
So again, I just say props to the team there at Capcom for not just dumping the ROMs and putting them out on the marketplace, but really kind of going back and touching them up.
Did they redo the graphics?
No, but I think they were able to do a good port economically, probably.
This was probably a very economic port that they did, and they're probably going to make crap tons of money off of it, so props to Capcom.
And I do approve, especially if you remember Magic Sword and Final Fight.
I think the games are done very well.
I don't think $10 is too much to ask for both games.
I think there's a lot of people that are going to be kind of one or the other.
I don't know.
I'm a little bit of both.
As much as I joke that Magic Sword's better, I definitely fondly remember Final Fight.
But if you never played these games growing up, at least check out the demo for heaven's sake.
So there you go.
Let's see.
Salacious Pop in chat says something reminiscent of Magic Sword here.
I recall spending three hours and at least $25 on Magic Sword with my BFF at the arcade and beating it from scratch and having my BFF take the dark orb at the end from the final boss instead of destroying it and becoming the new evil whatever.
OMG, spoiler, and my 15-year-old self was pissed and the credits rolled.
I believe that's actually an achievement now.
I believe if you actually take the Dark Orb at the end, that's the way you get one of the achievements.
But yeah, you have to work there from the beginning.
It's not like the Super Nintendo version that let you start on whatever floor you wanted to, basically.
Because if you ever played the Super Nintendo one, which is a pretty faithful translation, as was Final Fight, you could start on pretty much any floor.
But not in this one.
You have to start from the beginning.
You can continue, and you don't have to do it all in one sitting.
So...
Yep, props to that.
But that was really the only new, new game I played this week.
Everything else is kind of something I've talked about before on the show.
So that's going to do it for my gaming week.
Getting into housekeeping a little bit before we start the gaming news tonight.
Not a whole lot tonight for housekeeping.
Just want to plug the Twitter and the Facebook, of course.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
And we're also on Facebook as well at Orange Lounge Radio.
Please friend us or tell some of your friends to add us too.
Help us spread the word about our little program because we can't afford to do commercials.
All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight.
Loki's going to start us off with a little bit of gaming news.
Actually, a lot of gaming news surrounding one company, right?
Well, it's all kind of tying together, and it's all very similar.
So you may remember there was a little bit of suing and counter-suing with Infinity Ward or the ex-heads of Infinity Ward and, of course, Activision over some non-paid royalties.
Well, now they made an announcement that they are starting their own studio called Respawn Entertainment and they will be partnered with EA.
So, kind of almost that, you know...
The whole thing was Activision was saying that they're going to go off and take their brand with them to their own studio.
Partnered with EA is sort of true, but they're not really taking any brands with them.
They're basically going to be doing brand new games, new franchises, and that kind of stuff.
So it's really neat.
And right now, of course, the only two members of this new studio are Jason West and Vince Zapanelli.
And...
They didn't really give any information other than the fact that they're hiring.
They aren't, I don't believe, allowed to be hiring the ex-Infinity War people.
Those guys have been leaving, though.
There's actually quite a few people leaving all throughout the week.
Starting off, let's see, we had...
Oh, a few different developers or programmers.
We had John Shiring and a senior animator, Bruce Fares, both confirmed that they're leaving Infinity Ward.
And then also the lead designer, Mackie McKendlish, has also left the company as well.
There was also some other guys leaving.
um let's see some more lead designers um Zeed Reek uh Steve uh Fukudo and uh some programmers uh Rainn Wilson or Winson and uh I was gonna say isn't Rainn Wilson on The Office no Rainn Winson and uh Chris uh looks like uh Sharubi and I guess he was another lead artist so they've had a lot of different artists and stuff leaving and what not um
And of course, to top it all off, Activision, there was one of the execs made a comment about the conditions that they provide for their studios.
And according to Activision, because we have to believe them now, the chief operating and financial officer, Thomas Tippel,
L.A.
Times Company Town Blog
and then further he says that we treat our developers extremely well.
Independent Studio, or I continue, I guess, the Activision's Independent Studio model allows developers a lot of creative freedom while we take care of the back office stuff.
Unfortunately, that's not exactly how they were painting the picture, so I don't really know...
There's definitely a little bit of he said, she said going on.
I think they just need to go on Tyra and work it out.
It's like a divorce.
There was some comments saying that basically that the studio behind Modern Warfare is dead from one of the insiders, I guess, at Infinity Ward.
His comment was, they're scared shitless.
They never saw this coming.
He's referring to Activision.
They can't believe what's going on.
At first, they gave us some bullshit about moving up payments, all the money that they owed us to sooner increments.
That was when designer Todd Alderman and engineer Frank Galletti left.
But then the announcement of Respawn and then all the people leaving, they just got their heads in their hands.
And...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
you know how I'd like to see this whole thing resolved how
This is the plaintiff, Bobby Kotek, CEO of an evil empire video game company.
He's accused of being a douchebag who doesn't know how to run his studios, but he says he knows how to run them just fine and gives them the perfect environment to make games in.
Wouldn't he be the defendant?
Oh yeah, he'd be the defendant.
Ah, I screwed it all up, never mind.
This is why I'm not a lawyer, I'm just a schmo on a video game show.
But no, I mean, this is all, it's very interesting how this is all playing out in public.
Yeah, um... I... I don't know.
The problem I see is, you know, they're saying one... Well, Activision's saying one thing, how they, you know, give their studios creative freedom and stuff.
And then, at the same time, we see the Call of Duty franchise split between three studios now.
And, you know, all this... The reasoning why they wanted to leave or, I guess, were made to leave is because they wouldn't, you know... They didn't have that creative freedom and they refused to, I guess, go along with what their plans were.
So...
I don't know.
It just sounds like a big mess and unfortunately I think Activision might suffer a little bit for it.
Tigerclaw says this needs the law and order gavel.
There you go.
I don't know.
I saw a video a couple days ago, and I thought you were going to get to it, but I guess maybe you didn't see it.
I saw it.
That showed the credits of Infinity Ward, and it just shows the red lines through all the people that have left.
And while there does seem to be quite a few people that are still there, it's kind of like a lot of the testers and sort of the, I hate to use insulting words, but kind of like the lower entry-level positions seem to mostly be the ones that are still there.
And then most of the higher-ups, though, are out.
Yeah.
and you gotta really wonder what the long term impact's gonna be I mean, you know, Modern Warfare 2 is a huge game and whereas, you know, I'm sure they'll be I mean, they got, Activision got another studio to make Guitar Hero 3 Well, let me put it this way So somebody else will do Modern Warfare but it's definitely gonna be different
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and you may still see Infinity Ward continue on but I have a feeling there's going to be a lot more people leaving and especially if they drag this out long enough and they are not paying their employees the royalties that are due you'll probably see a lot of these people that are kind of sticking out start to question whether they're going to leave or not so I have a feeling this is just going to keep on going
It's going to be very interesting to see what kind of game comes out this Christmas if there is a Modern Warfare game at all.
I imagine there's got to be, but I'm just interested to see how it's going to be different.
It's just going to be another Call of Duty game.
I thought they were working on a Vietnam one or something like that.
Oh yeah, that's right, because every other year, huh?
Yeah, and all they're going to do is just use the same engine that Infinity Ward created, but Treyarch will be the one putting together the game, so it'll be another world of war.
And what happens to the former employees?
Do you think some of them are banding together to form a new studio?
And what will they make games like?
Actually, the people they're leaving are not going to that Respawn Entertainment.
I think mainly because it's part of the clause that they can't hire those people right now.
It's a non-compete thing.
It's got to be good on the resume.
I worked on the greatest selling fucking video game of the past few years.
That and the fact that non-compete clauses in California actually I don't think are valid from what I've read.
so interesting well I'm not certainly I'm not a lawyer I can't even tell the difference between a plaintiff and a defendant but I mean there's a lot of development studios in like Canada and stuff I mean would that carry water if they I don't know but up north we'll find out what's gonna happen the plaintiff is the one doing the accusation I know that I was just I was ad-libbing earlier when you ad-lib you say stupid things sometimes so anyhow
But yes, the plaintiff is the one doing the suing and the defendant is the one.
Not that I've ever had to be a plaintiff or defendant, but I did.
I was on a jury once years ago and it definitely played out like an episode of Law & Order.
It was interesting.
Any plaintiff?
No, no, no, no, no.
Plaintiff.
That's what I was thinking of, Jay.
All right.
Look, moving on to other stories that have a little less to do with the shakeups and so forth, but a little more.
Well, actually, no, this is about a different type of shakeup and very much about television.
I'm sure a lot of you guys that listen to this program also kind of follow a lot of the other type of nerdy news, if you will, on the Internet.
And I'm sure a lot of you are big fans of Conan O'Brien.
DarkSakura.com
But the interesting part about this, I mean that part doesn't have anything to do with video games, but now that a deal has been signed, more news is coming out about some of the other deals that were presented to Conan, because of course when he left NBC it really seemed like
and DarkSakura.com
Team Conan was thinking actually of one idea way outside the network box there was actually discussions with Microsoft about an Xbox deal for Conan's show that would have broken new ground
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
which by the way recently ended and I stopped watching it halfway through and had it spoiled for me on the internet who won but if you watched even the first episode of the show you could see who was going to win that show coming from a mile away but anyway that's not the point despite the fact whether the tester was a good or bad show whatever your opinion is on that
It did set this really interesting precedent And I said this a few weeks ago when I first reviewed the show Is that, okay, maybe the tester is a little bit of a wonky show But it's still fascinating that there is this budget There is money, there is drive There are embedded commercials And there's ways to make money off Direct to PlayStation Network types of TV shows And even though the tester might be weird It's really interesting to see what could maybe come next
Well, you now look at what you hear about what's going on over at with Microsoft and the deal they offered.
And you could kind of think maybe Microsoft was going to do some type of free show or ad supported show or who knows, maybe they would have sold certain types of the formats of the show or whatever of Conan O'Brien like every night.
What's also interesting, and when I was first telling a friend of mine about this, he said, is this maybe like 1 vs. 100 was on Xbox?
And I was thinking, well, that would be really interesting too, is that what if the whole show had actually played out live on Xbox Network?
And you could watch the show live.
I mean, if you think about it...
Microsoft has the bandwidth to make something like that happen, and they have the resources to do it.
I mean, isn't it really only a matter of time before you could get live television through your Xbox?
I mean, you get Netflix and everything.
A lot more people are playing games versus watching TV.
Even though the Conan O'Brien deal fell through or whatever and Conan decided to go with, I want to say traditional TV, but that's not really the case.
He went with basic cable, but still a more traditional type of format.
It's very interesting to see that, okay, well Microsoft's pursuing these types of ideas then.
So what might happen in the next year or so?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And I'm not talking what it turned into years later, but old school Leo Laporte tech TV screensavers that was interactive with the Xbox audience.
Here's my problem with that.
And it goes for anything, even on the PlayStation Network or Wii or whatever.
Any of those shows are going to be obviously biased towards one console platform, and it just, to me, would seem like someone just shoving an advertisement in my face.
You know, basically, that's how I even look at the tester and stuff.
Oh, okay, it's a giant commercial for your fucking games.
Awesome.
You know, same with the, you know, screen savers type of show.
I didn't think, you know, and I gotta give the tester credit.
I mean, yeah, the show had flaws.
It had plenty of flaws.
But it wasn't terrible.
I think a lot of people judged that show without ever watching it for even five minutes.
And I'll tell you what, the production values on the show were not terrible.
Could it have been better?
Yes.
But was it like the worst thing to ever happen to PlayStation Network?
Not at all.

But doesn't Microsoft kind of do the same thing?
Whenever they do their Major Nelson at PAX East, they're showing crackdown.
They're showing the Microsoft stuff.
They're not going to say, hey, we were at PAX East this week and, oh, APB is here.
You don't really see that.
on the Microsoft content.
You know what I mean?
You do expect there's going to be that certain type of synergy.
And I don't know, watching the tester, I didn't feel like the game stuff was shoved down my throat.
I kind of felt like, okay, I'm watching a show about video game testers or whatever, and you kind of expect there's going to be video games involved.
And I'm not suddenly going to see them playing the Nintendo Wii on a Sony PlayStation show.
Right?
Yeah.
So?
But that's my point though, I mean, it's just...
I don't know.
I mean, I guess if you want product stuff shoved into your face and you're going to subscribe to their online magazine, but it's just I don't really want to see that.
Now, if they actually brought the screensavers as the screensavers were to the network, then yeah, that would be fine.
But it's not going to be that way.
It's going to be kind of biased, and that's not something I'm really interested in.
I see what you're saying.
Because there would be an Xbox or a Microsoft-centric spin on it.
You're not going to see Max and things like that on the Xbox screens.
Because it wouldn't be like, yeah, I bought my 360 and it died four days later, you know.
You don't come to think of it.
Sorry to cut you off, but doesn't Microsoft kind of have, I mean, I think of, and I don't know if this is still around, but I'm thinking, okay, because we're sort of relatives.
We're like distant cousins of this, okay?
So All Games Network is the network we're on, right?
Who is run by Scott Rubin, right?
And Scott used to be on a TV show on G4 called G4 TV, right?
I'm playing like six degrees of Kevin Bacon here, right?
Yeah.
Okay, Scott hosted with Laura Foy was one, and the other girl was Tina.
I keep wanting to say Tina Fey, but it's not that.
It's
Oh gosh, I'm going to get yelled at by the chat room for not knowing this.
But these two gals hosted the show with Scott.
After the G4 TV thing folded that show, they went on to do some Microsoft-centric show.
Like 10-something it was called.
I know there's people that have listened to allgames.com for years that are going to jump in here and yell at what it is in our chat room at chatdowners.com.
But Microsoft is doing a show like that, or was at one time.
They did these little specials.
Thank you, Tina Wood They were doing these little specials for some time that weren't available on Xbox per se but it was on Microsoft's website and they were all about fun features of Microsoft and going out to the shows and so forth and showing what's going on
because another point I just wanted to say if there was a Conan centric show on Xbox or what have you I don't think it would be restricted to just Xbox I think there would be a way to get it on your Zune there would be a way to get it on your Windows mobile phone and there would be ways to get it on your desktop computer but the technology is certainly there
Yeah.
There you go.
On 10.
Thank you.
See, I knew I knew that there's a lot of people listen to us because of the all games connection and how we kind of joined up with that.
So I knew some of them have been following Scott and the old G4 family for years.
And yeah, Tiger Claw reminds us Diane Mizzota from the old G4 TV days is now on Scott's new show, the Appaday TV, which I watched the iPad special.
It was pretty good.
Every day though, that's going to be a lot of work App a day, one app a day An app a day keeps the Microsoft away, a doctor away, I don't know Alright, anyhow So I think it's very interesting, this whole Conan thing I mean, I can see why it didn't work out But it does kind of leave a very interesting door open to what might happen in the future So, we'll see
Anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news.
DarkSakura.
Why don't we?
We brought up Final Fight Double Impact earlier.
I'm sorry, Magic Sword Double Impact, Rob.
Well, the soundtrack is available.
You can download the remix soundtrack as done by Simon Vickland, the guy who also did the score for Bionic Commando Rearmed.
I will be, of course, linking that in the chat room.
But you can also find it at FinalFightGame.com slash remix.
So go get it.
Love Final Fight music.
I also think it's pretty cool that he's just putting it up there for free.
I like that these video game companies are putting up soundtracks for free, but they're not the only ones, right, DarkSakura?
Don't think so.
Let's see.
Yeah, also the God of War trilogy soundtrack is available.
And, of course, I think that's pretty cool that Sony's doing that for God of War 3.
Actually, I'm sorry, the whole trilogy, if I'm right.
God of War 3 God of War 3
I'm kind of surprised we don't see more game soundtracks out there.
I mean, not necessarily for free.
The Blood and Metal EP?
But, you know, I'm talking about even on iTunes.
And I should say, there's definitely been an increase of game soundtracks available on iTunes.
But, you know, these game soundtracks are really just promotion for the game at the end of the day.
So why not give them out for free?
Well, I linked it in the chat room, too.
There you go.
Good job.
Also, I just wanted to say real quick, we had a little bit of stream downtime.
I don't know.
We had a stream hiccup that happened.
We just kept right on rolling the tape.
But our live listeners are just now coming back on.
And there's some chat comments from before the hiccup.
And I wanted to get to some of these.
Blackwolf in our chat room, of course, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf, who tapes before us at All Games Radio.
He said, I wanted to point out that some of the on 10 stuff from E3 2007 actually showed people playing Wii games.
I was surprised.
Does that maybe play into the... And I don't want to... Maybe I shouldn't go back and open this whole can of worms.
But does that maybe play into the whole conspiracy theory from about three years ago before the Wii really took off on OMG Microsoft wants to buy Nintendo?
Like...
And also, didn't they say at one point that, maybe it was Nintendo that said this, I don't know, but somebody said that Microsoft is competing with Sony, not Nintendo Yeah So maybe, you know, showing a Wii game is okay, but showing a PS3 game not okay And I could see that
I don't know.
Anyway, sorry.
They're not saying that now.
Yeah, now that Natal's coming out, they probably won't be showing those wee clips anymore because now they are a little bit more of a competitor.
We'll see.
Anyway, for the live listeners, we'll play some of the songs from those soundtracks a little later on during our break.
For those of you listening on the podcast, you will have to go grab those at the URLs DarkSakura already gave you.
Yep, go get them.
All right.
Well, in case you're wondering, the teased Nintendo 3DS is going to be Nintendo's next platform, not necessarily just a revision of the current hardware.
It is actually going to be a brand new platform.
And that makes sense considering some of the stories we've talked about the 3DS.
or stuff that could possibly lend itself to the 3DS like for example the patent that was registered I believe last week for some sort of rumble device built into the new DS and of course the fact that the 3DS is going to be in 3D obviously it's going to be probably backwards compatible with the DSi stuff or the Nintendo DS stuff so yeah that makes sense
But that's kind of neat.
So, new platform, finally, for the handhelds.
So, in other words, it's not just a DS upgrade.
It's a brand new.
It is a new thing.
Basically, they're saying that we've run out of ideas for new games, so now we're going to put out a new Mario game and a new... I will say, though, my interest is piqued with this.
I am very curious to see how this plays out, because I am...
I'm not big on the 3D thing.
I think it's a little ridiculous for some of the movies.
I mean, yes, Avatar was pretty, but I mean, honestly, the 3D gave me a headache.
I think I would have enjoyed Avatar just as much in 2D.
That's what I'm saying.
I mean, was it pretty?
Yeah, but would I have enjoyed it just as much in 2D?
Of course I would have.
So I'm kind of curious if games are really going to make me feel differently about 3D.
and DarkSakura.
I'm not really interested in that stuff because those glasses are so damn expensive.
I think the best system out there that they should really go with, and I'm very surprised that they're just going with the actual shutter glasses and stuff, is that RealD 3D.
Because those glasses are fucking dirt cheap.
I mean, they hand them out for like five bucks when you go see a 3D movie, and it works just as well as those shutter glasses.
So, if they can come up with a TV that supports that, I think that'd be the way to go because, hell, I mean...
Don't have enough for your friends or something Just go buy a pack of 10 for like 20 bucks or something I don't know It's kind of funny, Sagan in our chatroom says Holodeck missed And if you're new to the show and you've never heard me kind of say Oh, we're one step closer to the Holodeck Every time we hear about this new invention in games Or the next generation of games Because the show's been on a little while now When our show started, the PlayStation 2 was still new, okay?
Whenever these new things are announced, it's always kind of like joking, well, we're one step closer to the holodeck, which from Star Trek The Next Generation was, you know, there is no, you basically were in the environment you wanted to be in or play your game or simulation in.
And I kind of think the one thing I could see that could be very cool about 3D is that, well, I don't even know if cool is the word I would use, but can you imagine, not so much on the DS, but on a big console, a big TV, a 3D version of Silent Hill?
I don't even know if I could play a game like that.
I think it just might be too much for me.
Like sensory overload, you know?
All I have to do is make this technology affordable.
Because if that system comes out at $200, that's not going to work.
A game like Myst could be doable.
I mean, the reason why I read that quote is because Myst, I don't know, there's a creepiness to Myst, but not, like, scary.
There's just a certain, like, I don't know.
I played Myst online for a couple weeks.
I'd want Holodeck Phantasmagoria.
Yeah.
You're sick.
But there's a certain creepiness to it without being, like, just downright scary.
Can you imagine 3D F-Zero?
I'd barf.
Like, 3D F-Zero would move very quickly.
F-Zero's a very fast-moving game.
I'd probably barf.
I think it might be too much.
Here's what I'm surprised, and we may see this later on, is, sorry, TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, people will just play WoW in realistic 3D.
is like arcade games with this kind of technology built in because it's just an LCD screen with some sort of extra screen in front of it that directs the light to your eyes.
That'd be perfect because especially sit-down racing games and stuff, you're obviously at a certain distance away from the screen that they could calibrate it to and there you go.
Yeah, but arcade games, I mean, I don't mean to jump ahead, but I know we have a story coming up later about arcades further on the decline and it's kind of like...
I don't know, that's a lot of money.
Alright, well I was talking about Sensory Overload and that kind of ties into the next story and it's about this study that was conducted by Australian researchers and what they're trying to do is kind of refute the claim that if you play violent video games before you go to bed you're going to have a hard time falling asleep so what they did is they did this study they took two groups of teenage boys sorry, no girls allowed apparently in this study and they made them play 50 minutes of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 I'm sorry, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare they split them into two groups
and one group played Call of Duty 4 the other group watched March of the Penguins while lying in bed and then after 50 minutes they had to go to sleep and what they found out the group that played Modern Warfare overall only took a few minutes longer to fall asleep than those that were watching the movie
That's because it's the March of the Penguins.
They would have fallen asleep from the movie.
Exactly.
It's boring.
Well, I think the reason why it might take longer to fall asleep is it has nothing to do with the violent content.
I think a more accurate thing would have been play Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare versus Super Mario Galaxy or something.
Well, maybe that's not the best.
Or Little Big Planet.
Something more G-rated in video games.
Because...
I think the reason why, you know, even though this whole study is supposed to show, oh, it doesn't keep you up as late, you know, whatever.
I think even the few minutes were probably because modern warfare is more interactive.
It's more mentally stimulating.
Yeah, it stimulates your mind more than watching a movie isn't quite as mentally stimulating.
Especially March of the Penguins.
I mean, my God, why would you torture someone like that?
I mean, like, I love penguins, but March of the Penguins, yeah, I was about to go to sleep during March of the Penguins.
I preferred Happy Feet.
Thank you very much.
Just so you know.
No, it's, I mean, I've been like, I want to go in the other group.
So there you go.
But this kind of begs the question, you know, kind of tying into the whole, and I'm asking this to the chat room as well.
So chatters, please voice your mind on this one.
Has there been a time where video games have ever impacted your sleep?
I've had dreams about games.
Yeah?
The same way you do about movies, you know, and shows and stuff.
I've had an interesting Silent Hill dream that I actually wanted to pitch as a game.
Oh, really?
Yeah, but it would be spoiling the ending.
Okay, well, let me not ask so much about the actual dream itself, but let me see your sleep habits.
Has video games ever impacted when you go to bed or how late you're staying up at night?
Not really.
I mean, I have a couple of times gotten caught up in a game, like just playing some Star Trek online, and then I'll realize that I've fallen asleep in a battle or something, and then I'll just turn it off.
Nice.
I've done that once, by the way.
but I not really, I mean I'd stay up all night playing Blue Dragon but my plan first was to stay up all night and I played Blue Dragon to keep myself staying up all night I remember when I was younger I literally stayed up till like 6am in the morning playing Super Mario Bros.
2 when I first played it I did that though with Final Fantasy 3 over here, Final Fantasy 6 so I did that, I did it for a week and then World of Warcraft, you know there's that raid that keeps you up later than you intended
I mean, I'll admit it, it's happened.
Video games have impacted my sleep.
How about you, Loki?
Final Fantasy XI.
I used to play with the Japanese folks.
In order to play with the Japanese guys, you have to stay up until 5 in the morning.
I've done that before.
I did it on purpose.
No, but see, that's the thing, though.
That was a conscious choice.
It wasn't like, oh, games making me stay up.
And I have to say, though, after I'm done gaming, I fell asleep like a rock.
I mean, it did not keep me up at all.
I have no problem going to sleep.
Really, when you get down to the bottom of the study, what is it that they're trying to figure out?
They're trying to figure out whether they can blame games for something else.
I mean, that's really what it comes down to.
It's like, oh my god, violent video games are bad because they prevent you from sleeping.
I mean, really?
Because you just lie there in bed thinking about all the blood you just splattered.
You're not going to play the violent video game and go to bed and go, oh my god, someone's going to kill me now.
Unless you're like mentally disturbed and in which case you shouldn't be playing games in the first place at least that way and I mean if games are affecting you in that way don't play them right before bed I mean come on take some damn responsibility for yourself don't we don't need to be funding the I mean who did this obviously it's somebody funded by somebody else so that's money wasted right there if you ask me.
Let's go to our chat room with some comments and answers to the question.
Have you ever stayed up all night and had your sleep plans impacted by a video game?
Shaoran says, if by impacted your sleep you mean play Final Fantasy X all night, in that case, yeah.
Dartetsuya says, does staying up till all hours of the night playing Beat Media 2DX count?
Bochikawa says, it has, but I've got sleep issues.
I sleep for too long and use entertainment to try to regulate hours.
Ranma says Sky that was me with Super Mario Bros.
3 and now I'm doing it with Final Fantasy 13 you know what I kind of find is that I just have a hard problem falling asleep before midnight period and I don't know if games are to really blame for that but I just like I don't go to bed before midnight ever even if I have to be up at 5 in the morning or no matter what time I have to be up I can't like force myself to go to bed before midnight just force feed yourself shows that you don't want to watch like for example reruns on the Food Network it'll put you to sleep without you even knowing it
I can't let myself do that.
I don't know why.
I can't let myself do that either.
I can take a towel at all PM if I really want to.
But then my wife is leaning on one side, my cat's on my lap, so it's like I'm stuck there with my eyes glued open trying to watch the same episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.
And it's like, I've already seen this eight times.
I don't want to see it again.
All right.
No, but seriously, though, everybody is basically saying that they made conscious choices to stay up because the game they want to play, you know, was fun.
Not necessarily that they stopped playing and they couldn't fall asleep because they were playing a violent video game or a video game in general.
So once again, do we really need this study?
On the same token, I have stayed up late reading a book because I wanted to finish the book.
I wanted to get to the next chapter.
I've stayed up watching entire TV series because I wanted to see the next episode.
I wanted to see what happened next.
So it's the same thing.
I was up very late last night watching Mean Girls so I'm not lying I really was up till like 1.30 because we were watching Mean Girls I've read books and then fell asleep and started dreaming parts of the book like later on and then had to turn in a book report and it didn't come out that well because what I dreamt didn't actually happen in the book but it was funny because I didn't know that because I thought I had just been reading the book
There is an Iraqi video game coming out
Developed in Iraq.
Took 17 years to develop.
They started developing it under Hussein's reign because it was really hard to get in the items that they needed.
Good God, 17 years?
Is it on the ColecoVision?
1993.
Rabah Shihab was an engineering student at the University of Baghdad.
And after the Gulf War, he wanted to make a video game.
So he started... It was... There had been none made in Iraq.
So he basically decided to try to make a fun game.
And he wanted to... He wanted to counter the bad images of the Gulf War.
You know, the bombs and everything by showing something that's a little bit more culturally deep.
And so, according to this, he saved up to buy an Amiga.
And, um...
Doesn't he know not to copy that floppy?
Well, at any rate, they finish the game.
And it's about two brothers named Nasir and Blasir who went throughout ancient Mesopotamia to fight an evil sorcerer.
And so now the game Babylonian Twins is being published for iPhone.
And iPod Touch.
Sorry, iPad.
For iPad and iPhone and I guess iPod Touch.
But actually I watched some of the...
The movie of it, the little film of it is actually pretty cool.
So they basically redid the graphics all high def and added new music, new levels and it's actually already on the iPhone.
So you can go get it.
And it reached the top 20 in the first week.
That's kind of neat.
I really like his inspiration because I think the guy's got a really good point.
I think there's a lot of people over here, because a lot of us have practically grown up on the Gulf War.
I mean, I know that's a weird way of saying it, but especially the demographic that listens to this program in their 20s and stuff have known of the Gulf War since they were kids.
So I think the images we get of Iraq, unfortunately, are bombs.
Subtitles by the Amara.org community
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and he hopes that in America it can serve as a small indication of what Iraq is beyond a deadly quagmire.
By the way, of all places, I got this at AOL News.
Hey, nothing wrong with that.
I'm going to link this in the chat room and I'd love for people to watch the little trailer that came with it.
It looks super fun, actually.
It looks kind of Mario-esque.
I'm actually going to download it.
I'm on iTunes right now and I'll hopefully do a review next week.
Very cool.
Props to that guy for 17 years is an awfully long time and that's a lot of drive and something you really believe in.
If you think about it, we've only been doing this show, which has definitely been a labor of love, for what, 8 years?
That's not even half the time it took this guy to make this game.
Just food for thought.
To be fair, he didn't spend all that time making the game.
3 bucks on the iPhone and 5 bucks on the iPad The HD version on the iPad So you know what, you can spend 3 bucks and give it a try
All right.
Go look at the trailer.
See if it's up your alley.
One other thing is that because he actually put a lot of expense into it because all the stuff was really expensive to get, especially in the times that he was in.
So he was actually quoted saying that he doesn't expect to really make back the money he spent on it, but it would be nice.
So help a guy out.
Spend the three bucks.
Let him know that it wasn't in vain.
Alright, well best of luck to the guy in selling the application and getting the word out there that Iraq is much more than a war.
I think that's a very good kind of moral, I guess, to the story.
Alright, let's talk about some other games coming out around the world in some other parts.
We'll start here in the U.S.
with Loki.
What's coming out in the U.S.
this week?
Not a lot, but there's some decent stuff.
Start off with Blood Bowl on PSP.
It's delayed from a few weeks ago.
Finally, hopefully coming out on PSP this week.
The Classic Controller Pro in both white and black coming out to tie in with Monster Hunter Tri, which will be making its way out on the Wii.
Also, All-Star Karate coming to the Wii as well.
I guess that's a little bit better than All-Star Cheerleader.
and then finally Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper coming out on Xbox 360.
Also on the PlayStation Network and Xbox 360 Marketplace this week After Burner Climax will be the game of the week.
I bet DarkSakura is going to check that out Yep Damn straight Alright, let's go over to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates A little bit busier this week than it has been in recent weeks in Japan Coming out on the Xbox 360 Ketsui Kizuna Jigoku Tachi Extra In regular and limited editions on the 360 This is a shooter classic from Cave that's getting upgraded for the 360 Includes networking abilities where you can play with other people in a shooter
Cave did Eskbaluka.
That's right.
So you shooter fans, you shmup fans have something to look forward to this week.
And I imagine some folks will be importing that.
Also on the 360 this week from Square Enix, Nier Gestalt.
And this is one of the ones they've been teasing for a little while, right, Nier?
Is this one of the ones that's on the Unreal Engine as well?
Maybe?
I don't remember.
But it is a big new action-adventure RPG series that is coming out over here, what, by the end of the year?
Actually, it's coming out the week after next.
Oh, wow.
So, good.
We won't have to wait very long to get it over here.
But if you want to get it a couple weeks early, the Japanese release is out soon.
Also, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion is getting its Game of the Year edition finally out in Japan.
Remember, it took them a little while to get Oblivion over there because they have a translated version, right?
And there's a lot.
of Dialogue and so forth and Oblivion.
I mean, God, talk about a game with depth.
So they're just now getting around to their Game of the Year edition like we've had over here in the U.S.
for a while.
Same style on the PlayStation 3.
PlayStation 3 is also getting its own version of Nier, but they call it Nier Replicant on the PS3.
It's almost like a different game on the 360 and the PS3.
I'm not sure how that all works.
Is that like a Pokemon Red and Blue thing, but it's on different systems?
I have no idea.
That's very interesting.
It could be a side story.
It could be.
Sometimes that happens.
That's very interesting.
You don't really usually see that in the same week, though.
I'm curious to see how that plays out.
The Nintendo Wii does not have any huge games this week, but they have one called Ivy the Kiwi that sounds cute.
Ivy the Kiwi.
This looks a lot like...
Oh, some game I've seen on the... No, I guess it's not that same game.
Oh, it looks cute though.
I really like the art style in this game.
Looks very cool.
Imagine like a very hand-drawn kind of game.
That's coming out on the Wii this week.
I like that art style.
Google that and look at some pictures from that.
That's Ivy the Kiwi as a question.
Ivy the Kiwi?
Playstation 2 gets another pachinko game out this week this one Higurashi no Naku Koromu ni Matsuri but just what you really needed another pachinko game how about the Nintendo DS?
Nintendo DS gets its own version of Ivy the Kiwi but the big release would be Naruto Naruto Shippuden Ninjutsu Senkai Cha Crash comes out on the Nintendo DS this week yes it's another Naruto game it's a brand new battle system though you fill your chakra gauge as you fight Sasuke Itachi or Dadara
whatever uh if you're a fan of Naruto I'm sure you already have that on import and uh on the PSP actually some big big releases on the PSP this week Knights in the Nightmare comes out and I think a game that a lot of folks are going to be into on the PSP Disgaea Infinite comes out that's right Disgaea on the PSP with infinite possibilities let's go over to the UK
DarkSakura
And that actually makes me sad because of one of my co-workers.
Except for the middle initial, those are his last name and first initial.
So it actually made me think about him.
Interesting.
I hope it doesn't have anything to do with him.
And Vigilant Chronicles, an MMO.
21st Afterburner Climax, woohoo!
And the 23rd Dead to Rights Retribution, Monster Hunter Tri, Nier.
and The Whispered World.
That's a cool name, The Whispered World.
That's it.
That is a nice name.
The Whispered World.
Whisper.
Makes me think of Wispy Woods.
That was the stage.
Anyone know where Wispy Woods comes from?
Kirby's Avalanche.
Good job, you get a gold star.
I have that game.
When you go to the level, it goes, Wispy Woods.
You are a classic game sponge.
I love it.
Kirby's Avalanche was like my game until I discovered it was Puyo Puyo.
I was like, Puyo Puyo!
Kirby's Avalanche was my game and I never discovered it was Puyo Puyo until, seriously, this show.
And interacting with you and your sponge of import game knowledge.
You know what else was Puyo Puyo, right?
The Dr. Robotnik.
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
Oh yeah.
And I think a lot of people always wondered back in the day, like, how come the same damn game is out on the Genesis and the Nintendo but they use the different franchises?
Like, that was kind of weird to see back then.
Anyhow.
Talk about random.
Hi Loki, what's on deck next?
is trying to create a game to educate the public about the difficulty of reducing the US budget deficit.
So basically, they're trying to create a game
to show you that balancing the budget is hard!
And the joke, of course, goes that anybody who is able to balance the budget will immediately be whisked away to some secret government location a la Last Starfighter to balance the real budget.
It's budget mama.
Don't worry, mama will fix it.
I'm sorry, but why spend money to say that...
My dub is hard.
I can't do this.
I mean, it just sounds like whining to me.
Budget Mama for President 2012.
And the other way you can look at it is like, well, we don't know how to do it.
Do you guys have any ideas?
I mean, really?
I thought, and granted, I didn't read the story.
I just thought from looking at the title we're putting together tonight's thing.
I don't like to spoil myself because I like to kind of have topics unfold on air here.
But I kind of thought when they talked about a game about balancing the budget, I kind of thought it would be like personal budget.
Like teach kids at a young age how to not spend more than they make and maybe how to save a little bit and so forth.
That would seem like the game to make.
Like an Oregon trail, but you don't spend too much on the wagon wheels because then you won't have enough for food unless you take a lot of guns with you because then you can shoot buffalo and have 999 pounds of food.
And in case you didn't think that the Obama campaign is...
Out of it enough.
They thought that what you could get is support among the populace for an exceptionally unpopular thing that you need to solve this problem.
And also saying that the game could go viral.
Wow.
Way to use buzzwords that you have no idea what the meaning are.
Like Super Chick Sisters and the other PETA games and how viral they went.
It could go viral.
I'm sorry, it has to be good for it to go viral.
Well, actually, it has to be popular for it to go viral.
No, I mean, Joystick, Kotaku, and all those kids will report on it, and people will play it for like a day, and then they'll be like, LOL, and then never play it again.
That's what happens with a lot of these.
Like the PETA games.
Same thing, right?
People look at them, play them once, go LOL, and then that's it.
Honestly, I actually think that you touched on something earlier that might actually be legitimate.
Matt did.
There's also an A-plus genius comment in chat I want to get to in just a minute.
Okay.
I really do think that perhaps the whole point behind this is to trick people into actually playing it to get new ideas.
Because seriously, it's like I put it in the same category, and I'm being serious, as America's Army.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And maybe I'm taking your comment in the wrong context and running another way in it, but could it be then that you're saying maybe this, I mean, I don't think this is what you're saying, but kind of of that comment, maybe this is a way to tell kids balancing the budget is hard and think about how you spend your own money because balancing the government budget is next to impossible.
No, that's not what it is.
Well, I know that's not what it is, but I think it makes sense in that light.
But seriously, I think what it is is a way to tap an untrained...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I mean, keep in mind the benefit of getting, I would have to say, an unfiltered perspective.
Getting fresh eyes to look at something.
I mean, that is legitimately a unique way of doing it.
I mean, it's one thing to just go out and pull a bunch of people who you know to be talented in it, but another thing to put it out under the pretenses of a game and let people work on it without having a real attachment to it and see what creative solution they come up with.
A better sim would be for them... It's so crazy, Jamie, it might be true.
That's my thought.
And again, keep in mind, I'm coming from the point of view where... In the design point of view, let's put it this way.
You've got all these people who are trained to do... Oh, we use Helvetica for this.
We do Swiss design.
We do this.
We do that.
The FedEx logo was created by an intern.
just some new kid who came in so think about that you get that fresh perspective you get someone who's not bogged down by just the weight of the industry in this case by the weight of politics where could they go?
Ironically enough, I don't like talking about my day job a lot on this show, but I did mention I just started a new day job this past week, actually.
And I think part of what they're looking for me to bring to this position is a fresh perspective.
That's a big part of why I'm doing the job I'm doing.
So it's interesting that you kind of tie that together.
Well, if they want a fresh perspective, vote these people out of office.
These people were not voted into their job.
They were elected.
Right.
Well, we can take care of the people that put them there.
I think you're completely missing the point.
I really think you're completely missing the point.
But I worry that the people that would jump up and say, I'll do the job instead, are not the ones that should be doing it either.
You know what I mean?
See, I'm looking at this as a consultant, someone who will provide the fresh perspective, someone who will give the ideas, and then let the people who are trained, who see the big picture...
Actually run with it.
I think it's brilliant, honestly.
I really do think it's very intelligent.
Especially if our president supports the idea, then I'm very glad I voted for him.
Well, just so you guys know, it isn't the first time that they've tried this.
Apparently in 1989, the National Economic Commission distributed hard choices on floppies for $20 a copy.
And apparently also the 1994 commission also released a game with the title Budget Shadows.
and Budget Shadows.
And unfortunately, even though those games were released, we still don't have a balanced budget.
Okay, how many of you guys, total random tangent, but quick poll in studio, how many of you guys watch Channel 6, KVIE?
How many of you guys watch Channel 6?
What if it's not Channel 6?
I know, this is a Sacramento reference, but whatever.
KVIE, the PBS, how many of you guys ever watch that?
I have.
I have too.
They show some neat things once in a while on PBS, actually.
Besides just Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers.
We were bored one night.
Extremely bored.
And high.
No, not high.
We were so bored.
And the only thing it was on was a Michael Bolton concert.
And it was like, I don't want to watch this, but seriously, it is the only thing on TV right now.
Hey, well, actually, we had a story a couple weeks ago about how Video Games Live was doing a thing for PBS.
That would have been way better than the Michael Bolton concert I saw a Lorena McKinnon concert that was filmed for PBS that was amazing Although I have to say props to them for being one of the first to have HD PBS introduced me to Doctor Who when I was a child
Well, the reason why I bring that up, and I'm not just saying this comment is great because it's from a friend of mine, but Saganar Chatroom says, this is why I need to start the Corporation for Public Gaming.
I always found that there was a need for journalistic game development in the vein of the persuasive games.
So while I like the idea of having a budget-balanced game, but this isn't quite the most productive path to make an effective title.
And there's a part of me that goes, why isn't there a foundation for public gaming, a corporation like there is for PBS?
This Jazz Jackrabbit was brought to you by... Well, why not?
I agree.
Isn't it weird?
I think there's Flash games that are like that, aren't there?
It's different.
And maybe television is different than Xbox and Wii and all this, but certainly maybe PC games.
It is a little interesting that we don't have more of a...
I guess publicly funded game development thing, although I guess maybe that's part of what Loki's talking about.
I don't know.
This is very interesting.
I just kind of read that comment and I went, huh, that's a really good point.
How come they have it for TV if they don't have it for games?
Interesting.
Anyhow, we got a couple more stories here and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
I want to talk about Xbox Live and crime.
Here's the deal.
What happened is that there was a Connecticut man, just 23 years old.
He was out on bail.
I guess he had been arrested for gun charges, drug charges, you know, all that type of shady stuff.
Apparently, he got re-arrested even though he was out on bail.
Why?
He sent threatening messages to witnesses on Xbox Live.
This all according to the New Haven Connecticut Register.
Anthony Hayward is his name and he sent an Xbox Live message to one of the witnesses that says rats die slow and it included the witness's home address.
This was back in December but you know things take time.
Can we give him a stupid award?
We could.
You know what's funny though is that could just be regular Xbox Live dialogue if you ask me.
I mean he might not have actually been here.
I was just playing Call of Duty officer.
Seriously.
This is DarkSakura talking about the stupid award.
By the way, just so you know, he had been arrested last summer.
There was a stolen gun under the passenger seat of the car he was driving.
Apparently, the witness said he placed it there.
He surrendered himself to police.
He was charged with witness tampering, intimidating a witness, and two counts of second-degree harassment.
The judge set the bail for $50,000.
Idiot.
I gotta say though, Xbox Live, you know, you don't, it's just another medium now.
It's just as easy as writing an email or whatever.
Alright, DarkSakura's got one more story for us and then the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
Oh yeah, so you remember me telling you a long time ago about playing Descent and having to have it on 14 discs back in the day?
Yes, the little three and a half inch floppy.
You had to install like 14 discs.
Please insert disc two.
Please insert disc three.
And my friend, who I actually reconnected with on Facebook recently, my friend Avery, he modified a chair for Descent.
I thought it was pretty cool.
It was uber.
Awesome.
Like did the chair move as Descent?
No, but he had like joysticks rigged and keypads and stuff.
Okay.
I wonder if he still has it.
Anyway, so Interplay is actually going to be bringing Descent to WiiWare.
And, um, it's being developed by G1M2 And, um, we'll be using the Wiimote, um, to, uh, move in the game That's gonna be interesting I, I, I gotta tell ya If you have a hard time conceptualizing 3D in your mind Like, I know a lot of us did when we had to move from 2D to 3D gaming Like, part of the reason I struggle with Metroid Is I can't, like, just conceptualizing it all in 3D is kinda hard sometimes Like, Descent will seriously, like...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
These people, and I'll try to find the article again.
These people made a wall facade and put up windows in it with actually two plasma monitors and a Mac.
And they did the Wiimote hack and then had this sensor board that you could wear around your neck.
And it would head track the windows so you could go to the windows and peer through them and go around.
Oh, sorry, the poltergeists are attacking my room again.
but you could peer in the windows and everything I really really think that that should be where those kind of games go
Will you check this out?
I'd throw up, but I think it'd be funny.
Will you check this out on WiiWare when it comes out?
Probably.
Did they name a price?
Or a little early for that?
I think it's too early for that.
What I would really like to see though with that is I hope it's not pixel like it was.
I would really like for them to at least just clean up the pixels in it.
Or render it.
Shit, I mean...
Before we get into the next segment here, I just want to quickly ask DarkSakura a question from a chatter here.
Fun ET Man in chat says, Good night, but a quick question for DarkSakura.
Which Puyo Puyo is the best for being the most easily obtainable?
An actual Puyo Puyo?
Probably DS, Puyo Puyo DS, probably.
For the US, yeah.
I would say you can get Puyo Pop, whatever that one was.
Isn't there a Puyo Party or something?
There was this game called Puyo Puyo DS that came out when the DS first came out.
It's probably really easy to get and cheap now.
Probably.
But Puyo Pop, you can just get that anywhere.
And it came out on DS.
And I've actually got a Puyo Puyo that came out on Neo Geo Pocket Color a while back.
If you're looking for an import, though, I don't know.
I have the PC Engine Duo version, which my friend picked up for 900 yen in Japan.
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but just go get a Super Nintendo emulator and download Kirby's Avalanche.
Kirby's Avalanche!
It's also supported in MAME, too, by the way.
Oh, is it?
It's good to know.
There's all kinds of versions.
Nintendo 64 had a version.
Saturn had, I think, Puyo Puyo Sun, which is actually one I'm still looking for.
That's a game I'm actually looking for.
It's Puyo Puyo Sun.
Actually, and to be fair, maybe I shouldn't endorse the whole emulator thing.
I believe Robotnik's Mean Beaten Machine is all over those Sega collections.
It's tucked away on a lot of the Sonic ones.
In fact, I'm positive it's on the Sonic's Genesis Collection game that came out last year.
And that's a great deal because that game was only like, what, $20?
And it's like 30, 40 Genesis games and some arcade games.
and Mean Bean Machines.
They're cheap now.
Seriously, that's an awesome buy.
It really is.
It's super fun.
Especially for you younger guys and gals who didn't kind of grow up experiencing Genesis like we did.
And there's also some actually pretty fun achievements in it, but you unlock your games too by getting certain scores on some of the crappier games.
Yeah, good times.
Yeah.
Good times.
Anyway, see how much this woman knows about her classic gaming?
That's why she gets a segment every week on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.
Oh, by the way, Puyo Puyo 64 was a four-player Puyo Puyo, so you can tell me what that was.
See what I mean?
She knows her shit.
So every week on this show, DarkSakura dives into the vault and picks out a classic game that she thinks you all should be playing this week.
Right now.
She wants to edumacate you on a classic game.
It's called DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.
DarkSakura, what could the Classic Game of the Week possibly be?
It's Descent!
What a crazy coincidence.
What made you decide to pick it this week?
Because I felt like it.
It was either that or Microcosm.
Maybe next week.
It's certainly worthy of being the game of the week.
It ties into the news, certainly, but I think there's a lot of people that miss this game.
So tell us about Descent, DarkSakura.
So you go throughout the solar system from the moon to Pluto's moon, Charon, and you beat a boss robot, but then you can't go home.
All these infected robots, you have to shoot them and then stop the main robot.
This is actually one of the games that made me really motion sick.
It used a wireframe map.
But, um, it was only, like, around your absolute position, so you, you know, as you'd move through it, it was... It's really hard to describe.
And also, the thing that actually made me really emotional about this one is that you seem to always be tilting.
I mean, I'm not the only one who saw that, right?
So, anyway... I would play it spinning all the time.
I was in a constant barrel roll.
I had a hard-ass time controlling it.
It was actually one of the harder games, too.
It was...
It was a full 3D environment.
You had to increase your speed while using acceleration controls and directional controls and different stuff.
You had to pretty much multitask the entire time you were playing.
So that was pretty difficult.
It did have an 8-player LAN mode.
Actually, I think there's even still Descent servers up today.
Descent 2 was...
Actually, it's supposed to be pretty much okay online, too.
There were 27 levels and three secret levels in the first Descent.
You had, like, some of them were the moon, Venus, Mercury, parts of Mars, moons on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, blah, blah, blah.
Um...
so you would just show up in your different location when you started and you would have your shield energy which was like your life but you could only restore your shield through power ups and it would only go up to 200% and if you finish the mission below 100% your shield is charged to 100% but if you were above 100% then it would stay where it was like if you were at 120 it would be at 120 when you start um
and you did have limited lives unlimited in multiplayer and when you respawn you start from the beginning the beginning of the level so it's pretty kind of crazy it was originally DOS for 386 PCs at 33 megahertz you play it on something you know now of course it's gonna play like a dream you know if you can of course find the stuff you're gonna have to use one of those programs it slows like it would be too fast yeah like a DOS emulator
Or wait for WiiWare.
There is a port for PlayStation, and there was one planned for Saturn that never was released.
There's a shareware version in 94 that came out after Doom came out.
Like we were saying, you have to use a software renderer.
But other than that, it was just...
Just be prepared for a trip, because you've got to fly upside down and all this stuff.
You know, it's full 360 degrees.
I mean, the way I kind of think of this game is it's like Doom without gravity.
You know?
Yeah.
Well, and on top of that, the one thing that you're having to do is that the texture mapping goes every 32 pixels.
So you deal with a lot of pop-up.
Especially if you don't have things set to emulate it just right.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
and the engine used for it is a portal rendering engine so that you could connect different sectors.
So I thought it was pretty cool.
And they've actually released the source code without the audio in 97.
And actually the source code for Descent 2 was released in 99.
Oh, wow.
So different expansions out.
There's the Descent Mission Builder in 95.
Okay.
There was Descent Levels of the World 95, Descent Anniversary Edition that had all the other add-ons And the extra levels that Parallax made Descent on PlayStation and Descent on WiiWare that's coming out this fall As far as anything that's related to it, there was Descent Under Mountain Which was an RPG that used the Descent graphics engine But wasn't really in it And then there was the clone Forsaken, do you remember that?
Yes, I do.
Wasn't that the one that had the commercial?
Yeah.
The Future's Forsaken.
Yes, I remember that game.
And then Descent Free Space The Great War was put out by Volition in 98, but it wasn't really a Descent game.
It just shared the name.
Volition was working on Descent 4, but it was canceled in 2000 because Descent 3 didn't sell that well.
But it served as the basis for Red Faction.
Interesting.
Interesting.
So.
All right.
That's it.
There it is, your classic game of the week.
I can't believe it.
It's not Sega.
That's all right.
Hey!
No, it's a good game.
This is a great pick.
I felt it was appropriate.
It's very news appropriate.
I love it.
And it's a game I really enjoy, and I actually remember this one.
Oh, God, this game made me so motion sick.
You know what I was thinking that the Pixel ones never did?
This one, actually.
Well, it was really rudimentary 3D rendered.
It really was.
It wasn't so sprite-based.
It really was 3D rendered.
It kind of looks like Mode 7 Hell.
Yeah.
Well, except not as blurry.
Yeah.
But yeah, even watching it on YouTube is like... Blur.
All right.
But do you not see what I mean by it feels like you're tilting all the time?
No, and the full 360 motion is kind of hell on the brain.
I get what you're saying.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Well, we got plenty more coming up when we come back from a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio.
We're only halfway done, if even that.
We're going to talk about some moving and shaking going on on the PlayStation Network.
We're going to talk about arcades, a major arcade chain going through some big changes.
And Capcom, apparently some big news leaking out of Capcom.
Someone's breaking embargo.
We will talk a little bit about that a little later on in the show.
But, yeah, stay tuned.
We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, April the 18th of 2010.
It should be noted that it is the night before Dark Sakura's birthday.
Birthday, birthday, birthday.
Yep, so I'm doing whatever I want.
So happy birthday, early birthday.
Do you have to work tomorrow?
No, I don't.
I ask for tomorrow off.
Nice.
That's the best birthday present you could possibly give yourself.
But guess what I have to do?
What?
Hang out at DMV.
Uh-oh, is tomorrow the day your license expires?
And I didn't schedule an appointment.
No.
Because the thing that I was working on when you got here has been eating all my time.
That and I was sick.
Sick.
That's a bummer.
Yeah, I feel a lot better now.
Well, how do you feel about turning 21?
And now you'll actually be able to drink legally.
Just kidding.
All right.
You know, whoever guesses my age, if they shut up, then I will give them a prize.
Alright.
Actually, you know what?
I don't care if people know how old I am.
Okay.
You know how old I am?
How old?
I will be, as of 2am, 34.
Congratulations.
34 years younger.
34, and I still get carded for DVDs.
Rock.
There you go.
So, and I have to say, for all of you people who were in your late teens and twenties and are whining, shut up, it gets better at 30.
It really does.
It really does.
I was really dreading 30, but like 30's been awesome.
Seriously.
So far.
So far.
Life just, seriously.
Still got a ways to go.
Because it's like.
Did you hear that, Loki?
Life gets better at 30.
How do you feel about that?
Loki's not 30 yet.
He shrugs.
Almost there.
Nah.
Well, I mean, because it's sort of like you hit this level, like, right when you were in your early 30s, that, like, all this little drama crap stops mattering.
Like, why was I worried about that?
Why do I care?
And it's like, okay, so, right.
The least that has to happen with me.
I stopped caring.
I don't know.
For me, I just found I got laid more in my 30s than I did in my 20s.
You know, just saying.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
No, I'm not.
All right.
I just want to wake people up and make sure people are really paying attention.
All right.
Oh, everybody in chat is saying like, oh, I'm 27.
I'm 31.
I'm 23.
There you go.
I'm waiting for... Where's the... God, don't we have a 14-year-old that listens?
Cheeseburger.
How old is Cheeseburger?
Cheeseburger, I think, is 15 now.
Now, 15 now.
But 14, I was like, oh my gosh, do your parents know what you're doing?
And then what?
DS Master's really young too, isn't he?
Yeah, but you know what?
It's all good.
And the reason I can actually get away with saying this is because no matter how much you deny the whole, oh, I'm too old for the drama stuff when you're in your 20s, no, it still bites you.
I thought I was over it.
You're only as old as you feel.
Age ain't nothing but a number and a biological function.
All right, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.
Back to game news.
Loki!
Yes.
Quick stuff.
Actually, believe it or not, I had a hard time kind of picking and choosing the stories for tonight because there was actually a lot of good stuff to talk about.
So some of the stuff that we really should be spending a long time talking about got pushed to this segment.
So, some quick stuff tonight.
Yeah, so the PlayStation Move, you may remember, has a controller that's sort of like the Nunchuck, but not the Nunchuck.
Well, anyways, this was recently discovered in an FCC trademark that the new controller will be called the Navigation Controller.
So the Navigation Controller to the Sony Move will be what the Nunchuck is to the Wii Remote.
Awesome.
and then apparently Lost Planet 2 is getting some more secret guest characters that you'll be able to play as including a man who has covered wars Frank West will be returning from Dead Rising including a giant teddy bear backpack that he will be carrying it's kind of really cute how the teddy bear holds his extra assault rifle
That's neat.
And then, of course, there's going to be a guy from Monster Hunter as well.
They're referring to him as the Scaly Knife Gun Dude.
But that's pretty cool that they have all these characters.
I love the fact that they gave Frank West a teddy bear.
Although Frank West in the Mega Man outfit would have been A+.
Just saying.
Well, hey.
we can dream, maybe they'll have alternate costumes or something later on
And I'm just like, oh my god.
But then again, you know what?
When I was 12, when I was your age, Cheeseburger, oh god, I'm that guy.
No, but for real, I was calling into BBSs on my modem when I was 12 and posting on message forums and talking about tons of shit a 12-year-old shouldn't be reading or talking about.
So you know what?
All I have to... I just hope your parents know it's an R-rated show, but I don't think we're a bad influence.
I like to think we teach you, you know... How to think for yourself.
And how to write proper emails.
Yes.
You've got your... Seriously, you've got politics, nutrition, speech, debate, and grammar.
and Hand Eye Coordination above all.
Yes, exactly.
From video games.
All right.
Exactly.
Anyhow, sorry, Loki.
All right.
And then other fun stuff we can be talking about here, of course.
Pillow Fight Girls, a game that will be coming to the iPhone very soon.
And it features scantily clad women having pillow fights.
Which would be a lot of people, actually.
Apparently it'll be a reprise of the 2007 Java hit, Sexy Girls.
But, of course, getting the more PG-13 rated title, Pillow Fight Girls.
Yeah, well, that's because didn't Apple crack down on a lot of those borderline porn, the softcore titles, if you will?
Yes, but they are scantily clad and well-endowed.
Well, there you go.
Alright.
Pillow fight, girls.
In other words, half naked and big boobed.
I guess that was a politically correct way of saying it.
I don't like to be politically correct anymore.
I know you don't.
Another thing she teaches on this show.
How to say it plain.
LittleBigPlanet2 might have been inadvertently confirmed.
That's because musician Christopher Leary, who goes by the pseudonym Ochire, announced on his Twitter, here we go, Twitter breaking the news again, his song Infotain Me has been licensed to Sony for LittleBigPlanet2.
This is not the first time it's been accidentally mentioned that LittleBigPlanet2 exists.
Here's a clip, by the way, what this song sounds like.
Let me skip it a little ways here.
And hearing this, it does sound very LittleBigPlanet-y.
I could see this in like a watery level or something.
Oh, that's really pretty!
Well, here's the thing too, everyone's like, oh my god, they're doing a sequel.
It could very well just be a big old download content pet that they do and add like a whole new story mode with levels and stuff, because they've already said they're not doing a sequel, but it doesn't mean they can't release a new level pack that basically has an entirely new storyline to go with it.
I think they could do a sequel.
They could get away with it and not look like jerks.
I think they've supported the first one so well that they honestly, the paintball gun, the water, all of that could have been a sequel.
And I think they would have been able to justify having that and selling the game for 40 bucks or whatever.
but uh you know if they're doing a true sequel with all new media molecule levels and a couple new elements who knows what'll be in it I think it's okay I'm not gonna get mad at them for saying before they weren't gonna do a sequel because you know what I think they resisted the temptation long enough but again I would hope that there's enough here to really justify that big two in front of it but um you know media molecule really didn't disappoint with the first game I have faith but maybe that's just me
Super Mario Galaxy 2 is on the way!
How rad was that, right?
B-Mario was actually really cool.
Right up there with Tanooki Super Mario.
Maybe not as cool as Tanooki Super Mario, but almost.
Well, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is trying to up the cute and the memorable Mario forms.
Cloud Mario is going to be one of the new Mario forms in Super Mario Galaxy 2.
So you mean he's going to be angsty and have a big sword?
No, not that.
Like a happy, fluffy cloud.
Like a Bob Ross painted cloud.
Bob Mario.
Yes, he's a Bob Mario cloud.
Bob Mario.
There you go.
He got like these white overall looking things on instead.
And what he can do with this power, he creates cloud steps.
He walks on them and can get to out of the way places.
By the way, there's also a rock form Mario in case you forgot.
So there are some new forms of Mario coming to the game.
That sounds kind of cool actually.
I gotta say, Cloud Mario sounds kind of rad.
Rock one makes me kind of think of Metal Mario from Mario 64.
Hmm.
I forgot about Metal Mario.
Like, like, like, like, like, like.
Alright, this one's a little interesting, this story, and we could probably have a much longer discussion about this, but I thought the quote was worth talking about here, and it's something I don't think everybody's really thought about, and that is, how do you handle, in a game like Def Jam Rapstar, the N-word?
And, you know, because a lot of rap music uses that word, and there's a lot of people that aren't comfortable saying that word.
So, how do you kind of address this in the development of your video game?
And there's this very interesting article, and I'll give credit to Destructoid, who I'm actually reading this from and stealing the article on, that tries to kind of tackle this topic here of this.
Now, Konami, Def Jam, 4mm Games, all the people that went into producing this game, they're using radio edits for the songs and the music videos and so forth.
So I think that way you kind of skirt around the issue.
But actually, the N-word is one that kind of shows up still.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and so the guy at Destructoid went to Jamie King who is the chief creative officer for 4MM Games and got this quote in return and I thought this was worth sharing because you really have to think like how do you know there are some people that play rock band and even though rock band uses the radio edits some people don't want to sing the fuck and the you know they're in some of the songs right?
It actually made it really hard for me to sing a Fall Out Boy song, The Scene is Seen, it's an arms race.
Right.
Because I'm so used to singing it in the car on the radio that I just automatically insert, I'm like, it's throwing me off.
Right.
It's scoring me down.
So yeah.
So anyway, here's a quote I wanted to share.
We don't have ownership of that word, as white people, of that word.
I think the word does come up, and that is perhaps a word where, with radio edits, there is an opportunity to not say it.
We certainly don't make it a central part of the story or the career mode.
that is a very personal decision in that point in time regardless of race, creed, and color as for how you use that word in the context of the song obviously these artists are using it they've empowered it and own it to just shy away and be frightened doesn't mean we should abuse it and hopefully I think we've treated it in a respectful manner the way all these artists and their content and their work would expect us to very well thought out point on what is a very tricky otherwise issue
I just still like what Chris Rock said about it.
What?
If you're a white person in your car listening to Dre, go ahead, say it.
Go ahead and sing your Dre.
I told you about... Actually, I found a comedian recently.
I think it was Brian Reagan.
Back when I was hanging out with somebody else, we used to just go around doing the white version.
Yeah, right, right.
It was because we thought the whole thing was kind of ridiculous and funny.
Well, I mean, the origin, but now being pulled into common usage, I certainly think it's fine to take something and, you know, take something that was, you know, made for... Well, okay, here's another example, to rephrase better.
The triangle.
The big gay triangle.
You know where that came from.
That came from the concentration camps in Germany.
The triangle was used to denote that they were in a concentration camp for being gay.
But now it's a symbol of pride, right?
So, I say that if you can take something that was a sign of, you know, oppression or disrespect and make it something that you can, you know, to bind everyone together, say, hey, this is where we came from, this is us now, then I have no problem with it.
I actually would be bothered if it was taken out of the game used in that context.
You know what I mean?
Alright, well that's all I had I thought the quote was worth sharing It's a touchy, tricky subject But I thought it was a well thought out quote Especially with game design Sometimes you have to approach these It's just interesting that a freaking video game You have these sometimes very deep cultural questions That you kind of realize I'm going to have a lot of people paying attention to this game How do we kind of approach this tricky topic?
Yeah.
You know?
And that's not just with words, necessarily, but maybe images and violence and, you know, sex and whatever else.
I say it comes down to this.
If you don't like it, don't play the game.
Fair enough.
Alright.
Sorry, I didn't mean to make a long topic out of a short story.
No, but I'm glad that you brought that one up.
Alright, no problem.
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
Oh, I got stuff.
Um, Rock Band!
We... Um... No, not only.
Um... But it's actually stuff that makes me very happy because it's a bunch of stuff that I like.
There's, um...
GoHate and Cambria pack coming out with Guns of Summer.
Guns of Summer, Here We Are Juggernaut, and The Broken.
The pack for 440 points.
Well, Microsoft points.
Or 200 repoints each or 160 Microsoft points each.
And then individual traffic... Tracks.
Guy I can't talk today.
All songs that I like.
There's Suzy and the Banshees, Peekaboo.
Fuck yes.
Peekaboo.
We needed more Suzy and the Banshees on a rock band.
There's a three pack out there, but Peekaboo was like their biggest mainstream song, I think.
So I'm kind of surprised that wasn't in the first group.
Supergrass, Sun Hits the Sky, I love Supergrass, and the Violet Femmes, American Music.
And the ones that are going to be on Lego Rock Band are Guns of Summer, The Broken, and Sun Hits the Sky, the Supergrass song.
Also, more stuff.
Lord of Ultima is the browser version MMO.
Oh, Shermie, get away from the glue.
Yeah, Shermie's like, what's this glue?
Sniff, sniff, sniff.
I don't like it.
But there is a beta on for this, so you could play it, but it's coming out a week, so whatever.
But it's Lords of Ultima coming out April 20th, Tuesday.
Oh, that's not a week.
That's a couple days.
Anyway.
Also, iPhone games.
Street Fighter 4 gets a new challenger.
You get Cammy for free.
Cammy and her butt.
That's it.
For free?
Are they doing like a version upgrade or something?
I guess.
It must be.
Interesting.
Alright, well let's go to ZTwitter and every week we take your Twitter topics.
You can follow us on Twitter at OLR and send us messages.
and we post little reminders about when the show is posted and when we're going to go live and sometimes especially the real big time to be following OLR on Twitter is when we're at shows because we will like post pictures and take questions and I remember last E3 I was just like okay Twitter people what do you want to see today and I let people basically I was everybody's bitch on the internet it was fun good times
Anyway, let's go to the Twitter questions and see what you guys have for us tonight.
Not a whole lot, but some good stuff.
The ShadowSniper on Twitter says, So he's setting kind of a lowish limit, but I'm assuming maybe ShadowSniper has saved enough money that maybe they want to go purchase a TV.
I'm making a guess.
I have a 52-inch, I think mine's a Samsung.
And we got ours for about $1,200, so do the math.
Maybe you can find a good 20-something, 30-something inch for around there.
Right.
And Samsung makes good stuff.
My TV, however, is 1080i only, and it works just fine.
There's been some times where I'm like, oh, I should get a 1080p, but then I'm like, why?
It's not really going to be that big a difference.
It is no difference, trust me.
I have both.
But do you think there's a difference between 720 and 1080?
That you could probably tell a little bit.
It looks a little blurry.
It's not quite as crisp, but 1080i and 1080p, seriously, if you're flipping between the two, you'd never feel a total difference.
I think ours is a 1080p, but, you know, again.
SSJ100Matt says, all I can say is don't get a Philips and get a warranty.
Ziba in our chat says, Vizio is cheap and okay.
Yeah, I have a Vizio, and I got it from Costco, which I think is a great place to buy TVs.
Now, do you know they've revoked the constant return?
I heard.
Well, people were probably abusing the hell out of it.
I was like, what took them so long?
I'm glad that we got our TV.
They still have some type of return policy, don't they?
Oh, yeah, but it's not the free returns for life, free upgrades for life, pretty much.
Yeah, so that's good.
I'm glad they got rid of that.
They needed to.
All right.
Oops, I was looking at the wrong.
Let me put it this way.
ShadowSniper sent us that tweet twice and I got thrown off.
Sorry.
Oh yeah, Loki, you had an answer.
No, I was going to say refurbished stuff also is not bad.
We had our first HDTV was a refurbished... I don't remember what brand it was now.
I think make sure it's factory refurb, right?
Yeah, it was factory referred, but the only really difference between that and the current model is it didn't have an HDMI port, which I could care less because I don't really use it.
I do now.
I use it on my PlayStation 3 because I just don't want to have to swap HD components and stuff.
But, I mean, if you really wanted to, you could get, like, a converter for that, but it's not a big deal.
But, you know, we got ours, I think, for $800 a while back, but...
I now have a Sony 40-inch Bravia, I think.
It's not bad.
Shadow Sniper, I hope you're in chat.
I don't see your name unless you're on something else in chat, but there's like all the chatters are jumping in here.
Cheeseburger says, I got a 24-inch Asus from Newegg.
It's 1080p and I love it for gaming.
Dude, you're 16.
How did you get that?
You must have a job already.
I don't know.
Or got some money from the parents.
I don't know.
ActDev says, 32-inch, you're not going to notice a difference.
And Wyland says, I have a 1080p 42-inch Sharp.
I got it for $500.
Whew!
Maybe I need to get in the market for a new TV now.
Here we go.
I've had mine for a while.
They have a ViewSonic 32-inch 1080p LCD HDTV on Newegg for $499.99, $40 for shipping.
And Shaoran says, I'm still running the same SDTV I have for five years.
It does what it needs to do.
Or actually...
They also have another Toshiba one that's actually also 10 EP.
$5 shipping, though, on that one.
So I'd say that's probably the best or cheapest one you're going to find.
Actually, let me get into some of this.
Loki's just shopping on Newegg.com.
Check it out.
The other thing, too, is actually watch Sella.Woot.com.
Oh yeah.
And Woot.
Oh yeah, Woot will have some good TVs.
It's $5 shipping.
Exactly, $5 shipping.
That's where I need to buy a new TV is Woot.com, honestly.
Keep an eye out.
Okay, we gotta get some other tweets.
We've spent a lot of time on that one.
One last little one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Best Buy, look in their returns.
A lot of times stuff's brought back because it's dinged on the side or something.
If you don't care about what it looks like on the outside of it, you can get a good deal.
We got our refrigerator for like $300 off and our dryer for like two-thirds the cost.
Oh wow.
Because they were just dinged.
That's not bad.
Satur on our Twitter says, playing Harvest Moon, friends of Mineral Town on my GBA, waiting for Harvest Moon, Hero of Leaf Valley to come out on the PSP.
I guess that's a little bit of his gaming week right there.
Harvest Moon.
I'm surprised that's a series I didn't get more into.
I don't know.
Tiger Claw sends us some links on Twitter this one was originally in the show roll and I bumped it for something else that I wanted to talk about more it was about No Doubt and apparently No Doubt they have won the first few skirmishes in the battle with Activision I guess Activision wanted the thing thrown out of court because it was a lawsuit without merit but guess what the Los Angeles County Superior Court they ruled in favor of No Doubt so they rejected the shift to a federal court
and rejected Activision's efforts to try and put free speech injunctions involved.
I'm kind of not surprised by that move.
I think No Doubt could have a very good argument here.
It's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out.
I'd really love to see the contract they signed.
I mean, without being able to read that, it's hard for me to take sides in this.
So it's very interesting to see what's going to happen in court of law.
Also, I think worthy of mention, Tigerclaw sends this on Twitter, StarCraft 2, this is very recent news, StarCraft 2 has been given an adults-only rating in South Korea.
If a game gets an adults rating over here, only rating over here, it can be kind of damning.
Blizzard was shooting for an over 12 rating in the country.
Originally, they had been assigned an over 15.
They sent a newer build to the game or something, and now they got adults only.
No word on why.
Joke all you want about the addiction level of the game, seeing as this is South Korea, but I don't think that plays a part in it.
It might.
It could, I don't know, but Blizzard's going to appeal it, of course.
And they'll probably get their way.
I mean...
The release of that game is going to be a cultural event over there.
It's on the scale of a...
I don't know what are the huge releases here.
Modern Warfare, Halo, Final Fantasy type release, obviously.
Spazinator says, I guess for tonight's show, the show's been renamed Orange Bra Radio, huh?
Maybe that's what we need to sell, DarkSakura.
We should look into that.
Bras that are orange?
No.
For the lady fans of the show?
No.
With OLR right on the cups?
No.
Redertainment says...
is there a reason why Activision hasn't created their own bank in real life sure it might be illegal but that hasn't stopped companies before creating their own bank
Do you mean like buying all their stock?
I don't know.
I think he's being silly, but I don't know if I really get the joke.
Sponchtwang says to us on Twitter, Let DSMaster26 know I would take him up on his DDR Perfect Attack Challenge.
LOL, I only have access to songs on Supernova 2.
Well, you guys, you might want to try to find each other on Twitter and just YouTube the battle.
That's all we need.
DJ Ranma S is sending us a message saying, I don't remember you guys saying that the slim Xbox 360 was a fake.
I don't remember saying it either because I thought it was actually definitely a plausible idea.
I don't think it's fake.
I don't think it's fake either.
Was it proven fake this week or something?
I didn't see anything.
If it was, I missed it.
No, I don't think.
I haven't seen anything.
It's real.
I mean, seriously.
If something did happen, it'll be in chat soon.
We'll see.
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some other gaming news.
Loki.
Yeah, I was going to say, it's definitely happening.
One thing that is not happening, though, would be PlayStation Room.
What is Room, you may ask, because you might have forgotten since they haven't really mentioned anything other than what it was teased, I think.
I don't remember if it was Tokyo Game Show.
I think it was Tokyo Game Show is where they showed it off.
Anyways, PlayStation Room was sort of like home.
It was like a social networking service that was going to be available for the PSP where you had little characters or avatars that kind of looked like almost like Miis or your avatars that you have on Xbox Live.
But apparently it finished the Japanese-only closed beta and they decided that they're going to cease development on the service.
Oh well, I guess that's not coming.
They just pulled the plug because there just wasn't going to be enough interest in it or too many resources or home didn't take off the way they wanted it to?
Probably because they're going to save it for the next PlayStation portable platform.
That's a darn good thought.
I bet that's really it.
By the way, Ranma wanted to clarify his tweet.
He sent us a link to a news article on Xboxic.com talking about the recent Xbox 360 Slim images are fake.
and it shows a picture of a reported Xbox 360 Slim and it's just an HD DVD player tilted the wrong way.
Okay, that's fair enough.
Yeah, that picture is obviously fake but that's not the same picture that came up on the show a couple weeks ago.
So it might be disputing this story is a fake but I think...
pictures or not I still think the concept of the Xbox 360 slim and just some of the things that were being talked about at that time I think are certainly still plausible although certainly there are going to be many websites out there that claim to have it even though they don't because they're lying liars
I agree.
And they need to get the people who did his stuff on Mugen to make him.
Alright.
So, I have to agree to that.
All right, well, let's talk about more PlayStation news.
And this is actually really important.
PlayStation news, they usually do the network updates on Thursdays.
That is actually going to be changing.
And the theory is that this is actually part of the response to actually why the Xbox does their releases.
Here's the deal.
The American and European PlayStation Store updates, they are moving starting in May to new days.
And PlayStation Network in North America will now be Tuesdays.
In Europe, it will be now on Wednesday.
Kind of interesting.
Interesting.
I think there are people out there that might buy games on Microsoft just because they can get them two days before they do on PS3.
Do you think that that's true, Loki, that there's people out there that buy games on 360 simply because you can get it like two days before?
No.
Really?
I doubt it.
Really?
It's just basically forum bragging rights.
That's about it.
Huh, we get the game earlier than you do.
That's...
I think there is a small, it's small, but I think there's a group of people out there that knowing they can get the game a day sooner on the PS3 will opt to get it on the PS3.
Yeah, well I guess they would be able to say, hey, you know, you can get the game here first.
You know, they can use that tagline or whatever.
Hmm.
Well, there you go.
The updates are moving to be a little more competitive with Microsoft, although they didn't say that, of course, in the update.
But I'm sure they were like, oh, we're doing it because we want to be earlier.
No.
I didn't watch the video of the release.
All you need to know is that it's moving two days back.
And now it's going to get very interesting to see if that changes sales figures or not.
We'll see.
Hey, Rob.
What's that?
Who was it that just posted that?
Ziba?
Yes.
Put a deals.woot link in for a 42-inch 1080p LCD HDTV with three HDMI inputs refurbished for $549.99.
Really?
Yep Hold on, I'm looking at this right now Is it still like $5 shipping?
It's Philips, we were warned Oh yeah, that's right, we were warned about Philips And I'm going to tell everybody Whenever you're going through any of these sites and everything There were a few people who actually said they recommended that it was great But always check Consumer Reports before you buy anything Good idea, especially before you spend that kind of money Free shipping even, interesting It's tempting
There's people in here who said they did a good job with it.
Interesting.
I'll have to think about it.
SSJ100Mad is very anti-Phillips, though.
I'll have to hear more about his story before I decide to do it.
But thank you, Ziba.
I appreciate you looking out.
Kiss, kiss.
And there's a $10 coupon off at buy.com.
DarkSakura
Other stuff.
Dun-da-dun.
This is actually really sad news.
Sega has made a business decision and they are closing half of their GameWorks arcades.
That, um...
They, uh, are, you can't, no more good beer, no more good, god, they had good food.
Um, they're not saying which exactly ones are going to be closing, but, um, they're going to be, uh, closing, uh, seven, actually, well, less than half, but just under half.
Seven of the 15 locations, some of them being Minneapolis, Long Beach, Columbus, Detroit, Indianapolis, Miami, and Tampa.
But Seattle will live.
In theory.
In theory.
Well, this, I'm sorry, but this news story calls for a little bit of sad trombone.
There you go.
Yeah, that puts sadness into my heart.
Well, it is sad.
Arcades closing is sad.
I mean, I honestly feel like just within the lifespan of our show, we have literally watched arcades die.
You know what I mean?
It is sad.
It is sad trombone.
It's worse than sad trombone.
It's sad elephone.
It's sad tuba.
Yes.
It's just unfortunate.
Because we all met at the arcade.
I don't know if the show would happen if we had all met on Xbox Live or something different.
It's just sad that arcades are closing down.
It's not a surprise.
But the arcades that we met at is still open.
It is.
But it's different now.
You know, you go over there, it's just not the same.
I haven't been there in years.
It's weird.
So, all right.
Well, sorry to hear about the GameWorks closing.
More sorry to hear about the people who lose their jobs because of it.
Yeah.
That's the other big bummer.
Shout out to SadBananaPhone.
That's right, SadBananaPhone.
All right, Loki.
That would be, what, the banana phone song in a minor key?
Maybe.
I've never heard, actually.
Is there a SadBananaPhone?
Like, I have to hear this.
SadBananaPhone.
No, Rob.
So apparently the MPD numbers for March are out and people are declaring Red Steel 2 a flop.
Apparently the game only sold 50,000 copies in its opening month.
Okay, let's stop it right there.
Yeah, they sold 50,000 copies in the first, what, 12 days that it was out?
14 days?
So I wouldn't exactly call it a flop, but it is kind of on par with the other
The other Wii mature games, I guess, are out there.
Even though it is teen rated, but still.
I can confirm, though, it did sell about 50,000 copies.
It was like 49,000 and change.
But...
I don't know.
I wouldn't say that's really a good comparison either, but definitely it has been the trend that hardcore games like Red Steel haven't done well on the Wii.
So we'll see if maybe this will break the mold.
I guess it is probably too early to declare it a flop, but do you think there'll be a Red Steel 3, or is it just too early to tell, period?
Oh yeah, I'm sure there will be.
And here's the thing, it's like, the same thing happened with DJ Hero, where they're like, oh, it didn't sell for shit, and they really only had, what, a week worth of data to go off of, so you have to just look at the amount of time that's passed and where it's coming out in the month.
If it came out, say, in the first week in March,
Then it would be a different story.
Then, yes, it would be over a month that had passed, but those numbers would be reflecting at least most of the month.
And, yeah, that would be a flop.
But seeing that it came out kind of at the end of the month, I wouldn't really call it a flop yet.
Once the April NPD numbers come out, then you can call it a flop.
PlanetXbox360.com is running a report saying that their tipster, who's been right 19 out of 20 times... I'd like to know the one they were wrong on...
but the tipster is saying that Capcom had its Captivate press event over in Hawaii this past weekend and apparently what was being shown at the event well final builds of Lost Planet 2 and Dead Rising 2 which is to be expected but there were also some surprise announcements that happened at this event that you just haven't heard about yet for whatever reasons probably because the journalists are still coming back
or they are embargoes for a certain day.
Absolutely, that's probably what's going on.
Because you know why they do embargoes?
Well, I'll get into that rant in a minute.
Yeah, I know why they do embargoes.
Yeah, there's two reasons they do embargoes.
We'll get into that in a minute.
But first, the leaks that they're talking about, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is supposedly going to be one of the games that comes out of this.
DarkSakura
Apparently, they spotted a Marvel employee at the event.
The Twitter account for Marvel vs. Capcom popped back up recently.
Yeah, I mean, it all kind of seems like this is going on.
They are just saying they're going to blow fans out of the water with the sheer number of characters the game includes on the disc.
It will be a 2D game, but think Street Fighter 4.
Street Fighter 4 had its 3D elements.
As far as that goes, I can't see how that is not true.
Because, I mean... That's going to be all sorts of awesome.
Capcom has been awesome at sucking the fanboy wank for the past...
A couple years now.
I mean, think about it.
Think about the projects that Capcom's done.
Oh, we should do a Street Fighter 4 that's a little more inspired by Street Fighter 2 and it's like 2D.
Okay, is that what you want, guys?
You got it.
Oh, you want a new Mega Man game that's just like Mega Man 2 and the old school games you love on the NES?
Okay, guys, you got it.
What?
You want us to remake Bionic Commando and make it all souped up for Xbox Live?
Oh, okay, you crazy kids, you got it.
Like, really?
I mean, hasn't Capcom, almost more so than any other company as of late, been like, fanboy wank, you want it, you got it.
Well, because they know if there's a cry for it, people are going to spend money on it.
Exactly, and what is the next thing people have been crying for?
Marvel vs. Capcom.
And the only reason people say it's not happening is because of agreements and deals and Marvel and da-da-da.
But when Marvel's got all these movies they want to do...
Dark Tetsuya says, so more than the 56 that were in Marvel vs. Capcom 2?
Holy fuck.
I guess so, if this is to be believed.
I don't know.
Again, it seems very logical.
And why not?
Bionic Commando Rearm 2 also being shown at the press event apparently there I guess is not much about this there was just a trailer that was shown but apparently they're saying there will be more at E3 2010 but the big big announcement was Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so there you go I guess you'll hear more about it this week now do we want to go on to the topic of embargoes and why you're not hearing about this right now please do keep in mind these journalists went to Hawaii Hawaii
and all these other things that come with it and I mean
I don't know, there's a part of me that's kind of like, wow, that's almost, I don't know.
You're going to have to take reviews of these games with a grain of salt.
Well, there's something also here.
I'd just like to point this out because this was on Joystick.
It was a little kind of note at the bottom.
It says, editor's note, Joystick is not attending Captivate this year.
We determined that the perceived environment and the associated downtime of the event was not in accordance with our editorial policy.
We expected to provide complete coverage of all the Capcom titles shown at Captivate during E3 this June.
And then for more information on our policies, they have a link.
And basically, I actually read through their policies where they don't keep any of the promotional stuff that they give them the kind of, you know...
and DarkSakura.com.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Big websites like 1up.com, GamePro, IGN, they all were suddenly running stories on certain games shown at this event.
But each website was showing one different game.
Um, and we were kind of sitting here going, um, well, why did we do those embargoes then?
And it just, you know, the kind of the realization was that, oh, these guys probably had sold exclusive deals with these companies to get the first coverage on the game.
Because, you know, you know that if IGN is the first one that's going to run a news story on, let's make something up, Capcom, Resident Evil.
Let's say Resident Evil 6 is announced.
IGN has an exclusive deal to announce Resident Evil 6.
The deal is they'll say what the company wants them to say and they'll get hits from it.
It's kind of shady, the stuff that goes on.
Or they'll allow them to say later on get a good deal on placing those giant splash ads that cover the entire background of their front page or something like that.
Yeah, it's shady, but that's how the big boys do it.
Well, that's why I'm perfectly fine with our show being off the radar, even if we suffer in the number of listeners because of it.
We have integrity.
If a game company wanted to fly me to Hawaii to check out their game schedule, I'm not going to say no.
I don't think we have that same editorial policy.
But I think the general understanding is that we're going to be honest at the end of the day, period.
But I can see where people might be like, oh, but you getting all this lavish treatment, you're going to have a biased opinion on the game.
And that's why Joystick has the policy they do.
Not really.
I can't imagine.
I don't either.
I've gone to events and seen games and said, you know what, they need to work on this.
We've gone to Konami events and there's a lot of stuff that we've been pretty negative about.
That's why we're not invited to Konami events anymore.
You know what?
Until you stop going to IGN for you news and until you stop going to the very first website that cracks all this information, this trend will continue.
Period.
So I'll bet you what?
I bet you some website beats the others to the punch.
on this news, assuming it turns out to be true.
Which, again, I'm sure it is.
This would make perfect sense for Capcom, period.
This is more of a, well, Marvel, let them do it question.
This is rumored to be revealed in a few weeks anyway.
That's true.
It was already going around.
Oh, now some people are bringing up the whole... I'm sure they were buying the 10s they were going to give in their review.
That kind of references the whole... Oh, God, what was it?
It was Games...
Yes, Kane and Lynch and GameSpot and the guy ended up leaving over it.
Oh man.
Oh man, what a mess.
Actdeft wanted to reiterate that Kotaku has a similar policy.
I just, I missed it, okay?
I've been gone all weekend.
But I'm sure there's lots of websites that have a very similar policy.
So then my question would be, who went?
I don't know.
And apparently not everybody can be trusted.
Somebody blabbed their mouth to Planet Xbox 360.
I didn't see anybody saying, hey, we're going to Captivate and we'll be talking about it.
Because it's embargoed.
They can't say they're going.
Well, big Capcom news as soon as I get home from Hawaii.
Anyhow.
Alright, let's move on.
We're going to get to the mailbag.
Every week you guys send us emails.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we like to crack open the mailbag and read them here on the air.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, DarkSakura.
Dive in the mailbag, head first.
Pull out some emails.
You know what, Rob, though?
I have to say, you know what?
It sounded like you said.
Huh?
You have to crap out.
It did sound like what you said.
Why don't you crap out some emails, DarkSakura?
How about you bite my butt, Rob?
Not if you're going to crap out emails.
You're the one who brought up crap.
Okay.
Dear OLR crew, long time no email.
So I figured I would chime in my thoughts regarding the shutdown of Halo 2 Xbox Live support.
Really, I'm not that sad to buy it, seeing how I've already moved on from the game, occasionally playing Halo 3 online.
But the enjoyment I got out of Halo 2 actually wasn't from the online play.
I remember back in the day when me and my friends used to schedule a Halo party where everyone would bring a TV in their systems and play via system link.
It was a freaking blast.
You know, we used to do that.
Dan's bachelor party.
was a Halo LAN party using the system link.
What would be nice is if Bungie made a Halo 2 map pack for Halo 3.
Because honestly, the maps in Halo 3 are boring in comparison, at least for me.
Oh, how I long for the headshots on Coagulation and the headlong once more.
Thanks for reading, Osfer.
P.S.
Here's a link to a simple but really moving YouTube that you can watch in your own time.
You didn't put the link on here.
It's a simple walk through the multiplayer maps of the game set to songs from the Halo 2 soundtrack.
Ah, memories.
You know, I'm such a bad, bad, bad gaming journalist.
This is why I don't go to Hawaii.
I forgot that the Xbox closure was this week.
But to be fair, there wasn't anything I was playing regularly on Xbox.
I mean, yeah, Halo 2 I used to play back in the day.
But most of the guys that used to play that together with me have kind of moved on to just other games in general.
You know, be it Halo 3 or what have you.
So, yeah, that's right.
I forgot the shutdown was this past week.
Hey, don't say fuck Halo, Zen Thrill Zen.
All right.
You know what?
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
But you've got to wonder how they're going to kind of toss out the bone, if you will, to the Halo 2 fans.
And I think putting out the maps in Halo 3 is actually a really good idea.
Especially if you can somehow put in the Halo 2 rules.
I don't know.
Or you just let it die.
I don't know.
we'll see maybe but yeah rest in peace Xbox Live on regular Xbox oh but I am so welcome to now my friends list will hopefully very soon I don't know when this is rolling out but hopefully in the next couple months after E3 I will be able to have a friends list with over 100 people because I feel really bad because I have to delete people because new people will want to add me and I'm like oh yeah I really want to have you on my list shit but I have 100 friends okay who hasn't signed on in the past two weeks
I think I'm the Studio 54 of Xbox Live because I'll just delete people because I've decided that they're not elite enough.
No, I'm kidding.
I just, I feel bad.
And if you're an OLR listener and I deleted you, I'm really, really sorry.
It's just my list is full.
He's not really sorry.
I am, but just people I know in real life and actually see outside of, you know, the internet get precedence.
They get preference.
But as soon as Xbox ups the limit, open season again.
I promise.
You can all add me and I'll add you back.
This person is doing this just to annoy me, so thank you for messing with me.
Yo, OLR, what up?
This sentence is for, number four, DarkSakura, to read because I'm a bad enough dude to type like this.
Grammar and all around linguistics is not me forte.
Anyway, on to serious business.
I have a question for Loki.
Is it possible to hook up mix-slash-soundboard up to an Xbox 360 controller and play sound clips over Xbox Live?
Because when I play Call of Duty or any game with multiplayer in it, you're usually dealing with 12-year-olds that one out of every two words that come out of their mouth is something not pleasant.
Don't get me wrong.
I love expletives.
Like the fuck show is funny as shit.
But not racial slurs or other bigotry.
If I can get a soundboard, I would download a bunch of sounds and just fuck with people.
Only dickheads, though.
Anyway, I got to go watch all the new stuff they added on Netflix like Firefly.
I heard it was really good until it was cancelled.
Well, buh-bye.
Duh money, 125.
And yeah, Firefly is excellent.
Watch the whole thing.
They aired it out of order and they just treated it badly.
And then watch the movie.
Seriously.
P.S.
This email is brought to you by Orange Knowledge Radio, your number one source for news, previews, reviews, and talk for all things Halo.
Just kidding.
Isn't that ironic considering the past email we just got?
I know, right?
LOL, WTF.
LOL.
I don't know, Loki.
Can you hook up a soundboard to the Xbox controller?
Yeah, of course you can.
All you would need to do is basically just get the right connector to plug into your Xbox 360 controller.
You'd basically just be running a cord from your PC or whatever.
I guess PC would probably be the easiest.
And running it into your controller.
And you just need some sort of headset adapter.
and they actually do have one of those I think available I'm looking here right now looks like Intech made one of those although I'm not sure if that just plugs converts it to any headset or what would that mean we could broadcast our show on Xbox Live?
We could start an Xbox Live party and then invite people in and we could actually broadcast our show on Xbox Live.
You can only have so many people in your party though.
It's like four or something.
I wish there was a way.
Exclusive!
Could we just get in a Halo match and just stand there where no one can shoot us somehow and just do our show to random people on Halo?
We'd be doing it red versus blue style.
I think this though would work.
I'm not positive.
It says it's an Xbox 360 headset adapter from Intech.
It says it'll allow you to plug in any 2.5mm jack plug.
and I think... God, I don't remember what size jack plugs there are for different things.
I'm sure though, seriously though, you can probably go online or even to Radio Shack or something like that and just basically bring your controller with you and you can probably find some sort of an adapter or if you want, use this adapter with a converter to convert it to the correct size that you need.
And it does have volume and mute controls on there as well, so if you want to shut it off so you're not bugging everybody, you can do that.
I've wanted to do that as well because I think it'd be funny just to play stuff over live, but some people don't like that.
That's actually not the only way you can do that.
There's another way you can actually do it, and I've seen it happen, and I was going to call somebody to talk about it, but they're testing.
I'll come back to this.
I want to come back to this topic in just a minute.
So, DarkSakura, do the next email.
Oh, we only have one more email.
Okay.
So, moving forward, and ha ha, funny da money.
Rob said something like, most DS owners are kids.
And this is by the way from Robaba.
At first I thought, no.
But if you really think about it, what is the most kid-friendly game console around?
By kid-friendly, think about these factors and not the M ratings.
One, you can put it in your pocket.
PSP Go and the iPhone slash iPod Touch are the only others.
The DS is the only system that protects its own screen without peripherals.
Very pocket-friendly.
2.
Kids are destructive.
Part 1.
The portable system will probably get destroyed or lost at some point, which is the cheapest to replace, hence its initials are DNS.
3.
Kids are destructive.
Part 2.
The games are solid state chips as opposed to UMDs.
UMDs get crushed easily, whereas the DS chips survive most falls and step-ons.
4.
Parents are cheap.
Most of the cheap games are on the DS.
I'm still waiting for Imagine having fun.
5.
DS has buttloads of simpler games for the very young.
I have to admit I used these priorities to pick a DS over the PSP for the nephews when they were younger.
So I'm inclined to believe you were right for your comment.
Did I send this email back in 2005?
Kind of deja vu moment for me.
Of course I was right.
And poor Jamie, I just wanted to jump through the internet time machine and buy her soup.
Aww.
I hope you were surviving your allergies slash plague.
Rub-a-ba.
Um, yeah, it was funny.
I had bad allergies, and then, um, I was sick.
I ate a lot of cake.
And beer.
And then, um, yeah, I was actually sick.
This time around.
So, thank you, Rub-a-ba.
Thank you, and thank you for saying I was right, because more people should do that, actually.
Say I was right.
No, but I mean, I think you further just proved the point, though, is that all those things you named about how it fits in the pocket, it's true.
A lot of kids play those DSs.
It'll be interesting to see how the 3DS impacts things, if at all.
But we'll see.
If they're the right games for it, they might be...
It might pick up with the other crowds that are kind of into the more hardcore stuff.
Was that it for emails?
I said there were only three.
That's it?
We're done?
Well, I wasn't listening to you, as usual.
Mailbag!
Do not make me break out Shermie's butt for you to bite.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com She's just giving you an offended look right now.
Is she?
Yeah.
I'm looking.
Hey, girl.
How you doing?
Meow, meow.
She's like, bitch.
Wait, let me see if I can get a picture of Shermie right now.
Hold on.
Someone fill time.
I'm cropping a logo right now because apparently people don't know the concept of sending me an individual zip file with my logo's already JPEGed.
So I have to do it all myself.
No.
Actually, I have no problem doing this.
Rob is seriously taking a picture of Miss Little Fat Butt down there, looking at him all offended, sitting on her little throne.
I got a picture of it.
I'm going to totally post that on the Orange Launch Radio picture feed here.
Rob's going to totally do it.
All right, look.
Oh, my God, Rob.
Oh, my God.
I'm going to totally do it.
Okay, hold on, because we're getting that call.
I wanted to take this earlier.
This is back on the email about how do I hook up the soundboard for the 360.
So I wanted to invite SSJ100 Matt on the show to talk about this for a minute, and there's a reason why.
Matt, you there?
Oh, yes, I'm here.
How you doing, Matt?
Hi.
I'm doing good Now the reason why I invited specifically SSJ100Matt on the show is A. He's a cool guy But B. No, the reason why You might remember a couple weeks on the show And maybe you don't remember Because maybe you wouldn't have sent the email if you remembered this But I was talking about I'm just kidding Playing Perfect Dark with the folks on Under Sedation Live And it was the week that the Xbox Live had the release of Perfect Dark And I was like,
and it was like me and Alan were playing in one place and then Travis was playing and John was playing and then some of our listeners that we have in common like Matt, Misty and so forth were playing.
Well, okay, when Matt joined our game, hilarity ensued because Matt was playing these sound clips from like Duke Nukem and like, I don't know what else is in there, like probably old movies and stuff.
Ooh, ooh, did we have my favorite one?
What?
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
Probably, probably, I don't remember but it was a hilarious epic match.
No, you know, I really didn't do anything that complicated What I got was basically something that you could just buy like in the store Hold on, you're really really quiet, can you get a little close to your microphone?
That's alright.
Ooh, much better.
Basically, what I got here is a device called the Daytel Trash Talker.
It's actually called the Trash Talker, okay, and?
And not to be confused with the knockoff version called the Smack Talker, which is crap.
Okay, so you want the trash, not the smack.
Very important.
Yes.
Basically what it is, is a little device that connects directly into your Xbox 360 controller.
It comes with software and basically in a USB cable.
It connects directly into your computer.
And basically you take sound clips, wave clips, MP3s, and just drop it into each bank.
Now it has four banks and four sets that you can use.
But, you know, it also has like a preset limit as to what you can put on there.
It doesn't say in the instructions or anything, but it will give you like a small progress bar.
You can't put long monologues and things in the buttons.
There's a limit to the space on the thing.
Yeah, you can, but you can only just take up more space on it.
Gotcha, gotcha.
I kind of want to get one of these.
I do.
I think I'm going to get one of these.
But it's a great alternative to the soundboard.
You can just dump these files from your computer right onto the trash-talking device, hit the button, and drop in sound clips left and right.
Your very own personal soundboard.
Yeah, basically.
I mean, I don't know how it sounds on other people's end, but according to you guys, it sounds really good.
It's hilarious.
It sounds just like somebody's dropping the sound file in.
I thought I was playing Duke Nukem for a minute.
It's great.
I think what I'm going to do, I'm going to get this, but instead of putting in clips from Duke Nukem and stuff, I think I'll go to the Disney Channel and get clips from That's So Raven and play those with people when I'm playing shooting matches and stuff.
But, you know, it's funny, you know, I mostly use it, like, whenever I'm playing Mom Warfare 2.
And whenever I play, like, the Duke Nukem clips, a lot of the younger kids, they don't know who Duke Nukem is.
They don't understand.
So what they think is, they think it's some 40-year-old guy who's smoked a pack of cigarettes since he was 5.
Just talking trash.
Trash Talk.
Taunt your opponents at the touch of a button.
Don't get lost for words.
Unavailable.
Bad.
Oh, really?
PlayAsia has it available.
PlayAsia.
On Amazon.
You can get it on PlayAsia, but, you know, it's a little more expensive.
I think I got it for, like, 15 bucks.
Order in bulk, though.
Just go on eBay.
I bet it's on eBay.
And warning, it's a choking hazard.
They're small parts.
Oh sure, what the hell, why don't you tell us now What's your rant on Phillips, the TV question we had earlier
Well, you know, basically, like, two years ago for my birthday, my father gave me an HDTV, Philips HDTV, for my birthday.
And it had a warranty, but after the warranty expired, the TV basically crapped out a month after the warranty ended.
So, basically, I had to call up Philips, ask them what to do.
They said, basically, it's out of warranty, we can't do anything about it.
Tough shit, have a nice life, lol.
Basically.
Yeah, pretty much, you know, they tell you to take it to a repair shop, but, you know, taking an HDTV to a repair shop, that's basically, you're going to have to buy a brand new TV.
That would irritate me, to buy a new TV and then have it break just a year later.
Yeah, but, you know, the problem was, you know, it works now, but I have to let it warm up for half an hour before I can use it.
Which is a pain in the ass, but it turned out that the problem was...
There's a short somewhere in the circuit board, which is common for some of their TVs.
I don't know if it's common with their current stuff.
I don't know, maybe they fixed the problem two years after the fact, but
I mean, that's my problem with Philips.
Alright, well, so noted.
So I will definitely take that into consideration before I spend a lot of money on a television.
But again, like I said before, what I really need to do is get the car.
So when I get the car, then I'll worry about the TV.
Because the TV I have is not bad.
But we have something for you.
Oh, go ahead.
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
Have a good night, Matt.
You're welcome.
Thanks for letting us pick on you.
Alright.
What was it?
That clip from Heavy Rain.
Jason!
Jason!
Jason!
I remember that you used to be able to put your own voice macros in.
You know, like we did one, what are you, the poster child for abortion or something?
You know.
Jason Jason Jason Jason Jason
That'd be awesome.
These guys are filming the TV.
It's not a direct feed.
Let me see if this one's a direct feed here.
This is the last one, I promise.
Oh, fancy.
Screw you.
Got some shoes for Sean?
Can you watch Jason for a minute?
I promise, he won't be long.
Sure, no problem.
God, we don't know where this is going.
Jason!
Jason!
Jason!
There's a little X with Jason floating around, so I guess you just press X to say Jason.
Jason, you really shouldn't want to rock like that, you know?
Alright, I'm over it.
You fail at parenting.
That was a flash game, too.
Press X to Jason.
Was it?
Jason!
Loki!
Why does the door keep opening?
Loki!
Alright, let's get into the FUs of the week, because sometimes we get a little angsty on the show.
You know, when I can't find Jason, I get a little upset, so I want to do some ranting on the show.
So here we go, the FUs of the week.
FU to being pretty sick over the past few days.
I feel a lot better today, although my voice is starting to go again.
But I really, I really, not like, I enjoy the projects I'm doing, but FU to this not being my job.
You know?
To me not being able to freelance full time.
I need to be a design diva.
They need to pay me for being awesome.
If Lady Gaga can do it, so can I. If she can walk around and call herself performance art, I can put something on a piece of paper and be called a design diva.
Would you get your own show called Designing Women?
I'd be designing divas.
That show would be more interesting if it was from the perspective of, say, a grand deity like God or something.
Designing women.
It would be weird science.
Awesome.
I like that.
Anyways, F you to my weed eater, or weed whacker, I guess, for shooting fire.
Apparently it's not supposed to be doing that, so it is now broken.
It was very unfortunate that it... Weed eaters do not shoot fire, just for the record.
That's not an added benefit.
Pretty sure that there was a lot of smoke and then fire came out.
I'm like, I think this is broken.
Yeah, the engine overheated and melted down, so that's too bad.
My FU of the week.
Actually, things are pretty good right now.
I can't complain.
I don't have a lot of negative stuff going on.
I will take this opportunity to take a tangent, though.
This is actually gaming related.
Not from Sorting Glue?
No, not from Sorting Glue.
World of Warcraft.
No, I'm not giving my F you to World of Warcraft, but I am a little bit.
You might have heard this week, they put some new items on sale.
And you can get a new $10 pet called Little XT, which is one of the raid bosses later in the game.
Whatever, they've done the pet thing before.
But one of the other things they decided to sell was a Celestial Horse mount for $25.
That's right, $25 real-life dollars would buy you this mount in-game.
DarkSakura.com
and it doesn't really enhance anything you're not getting anything special that you can't like earn you know through other means or what have you it's really just the ultimate vanity item and I have to admit there was a part of me that was like oh that's kind of cool
I kind of want to get one of those.
But then I was like, but really, $25?
That's like almost half of what the new expansion is going to cost for WoW.
Cataclysm's going to cost that much money.
Well, sure enough, all these stories start popping up.
The queues on Blizzard's store just to buy My Little Magical Star Pony was like four hours long, 17,000 people deep.
You would have thought BlizzCon tickets went on sale again.
All I had to do to convince myself I don't want a magical star pony was to log into the game and go to Dalaran.
Everybody has a magical star pony.
Blizzard, this week, cooked up free money for their game.
Literally, free money.
It's a test, because you have to understand, Blizzard is owned by Activision.
Activision loves money, and Activision likes putting out map packs for $15.
Mark my words.
Mark my words.
When Blizzard puts out the item, whatever, they want to do vanity and people are whatever enough to buy it, then whatever.
And you know what?
I'm not perfect.
I bought the panda thing when it came out.
I kind of regret doing so after the fact, but I don't because it was charity.
So I'm like, okay, at least in the end it was charity.
But after I bought it, I have to admit I did have a little bit of buyer's remorse of, you know, that was kind of stupid.
Everybody has one of these pandas.
I'm not actually going to use it that much in game.
This was a stupid vanity thing, but at least it was charity.
But never again am I making that mistake.
But mark my words, the minute Blizzard releases something that does enhance your stats or does give you an enhancement or especially something you can't get through the game through other means, I quit.
Period.
I'm done with WoW when that happens.
Because as far as I'm concerned, at that point, WoW has become Farmville.
At that point.
Tell me the difference between WoW and FarmVille when that happens.
Facebook integration?
No, WoW has that now too.
You can't play WoW on Facebook, but there is an official WoW application.
So as soon as that happens, which I'm afraid is now after seeing how well this pony is done, and exactly what Loki says is in the not too distant future, I quit.
I'm done with WoW.
because it's kind of insane in some ways that Blizzard probably sold easy a half million of these.
Blizzard made a million dollars.
No, more than that.
Blizzard probably made $10 million this week.
Right?
25 times half a million would be about what?
$12.5 million, right?
What will you play?
I don't know.
Something else.
Play Star Trek Online with me.
Final Fantasy XIV for one.
We'll see.
I don't know if Star Trek Online does the same thing.
No MMO am I going to do that with.
What Star Trek Online does, I'll tell you.
And I actually like this with the cryptic store.
You buy points.
And you've got them for whatever you want them for.
What I bought was... I actually bought the ability to play a Klingon on the Federation side, play a Ferengi, because they've each got their own bonuses, their own special abilities.
Because this might be something that I want, and I'm kind of a weird completionist.
But...
I liked that.
I liked that you could pay to respec.
If you've completely foobarred everything, you could pay to respec.
And it's not even a lot of points.
I've only spent $20 in buying points, and I still have some left, and I've gotten all this stuff.
They make it affordable.
So...
Alright, I gotta give some comments in chat because there's way too good comments here in chat.
SalaciousPop says, everyone has one, so whatever little originality your tune had just got lessened.
That's true.
Chad28 says, cough, I bought it, cough, but I'm super addicted to Mount Horror.
My question is though, do you have buyer's remorse now that you see that everyone has one?
I like the design of it though, I will have to say that.
It's a pretty mount.
I will say that.
But when I saw everybody had one, I was like, okay, whatever.
I would rather work and get that.
The Raven mount is so fucking epic.
It's the best mount in the game.
But it's a bitch to get.
I didn't buy it, though.
Did you see the link in the chat where they made $2 million in four hours?
God.
I'm not surprised.
I do have to, though, give them props for actually having a very unique design.
I mean, I haven't seen anything done like this.
Legend of Zaku makes an excellent point, and you thought paying for horse armor was bad enough.
If you had a problem with horse armor in Oblivion and you bought this, um... Um...
Just saying.
Let's see.
Let's see.
I'm looking here.
Other chat rooms.
Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to look.
Let's see.
SJ100 Matt says NHL 10 started letting you download additional stats to your creative player for blank XBL space bucks you can unlock those bonus stats in game but they were a real pain in the ass to obtain so a lot of people just bought the stats you know Gyromancer has something like that too but I don't know I somewhat give Gyromancer a pass because it's not a multiplayer game really I mean I guess it does have multiplayer mode but it's more of a single like player puzzle game I don't know it just seems different
And by the way, horse armor does actually make sense if your horse is part of your battle stat.
Chad28 says, there's also a rumor going around that they're going to charge 20 bucks a month when Cataclysm comes out.
Even I will leave if that happens.
Shaoran in chat says, it doesn't matter if Rob's done with WoW.
He'll be sucking MMO cock again the second Final Fantasy XIV comes again.
That's true.
True statement.
And Ziba gave Loki that link earlier.
So there you go.
Rama says, Sky, I'm going to hold you to that.
Go for it.
There you go.
Lots of chat comments.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join in.
Anyhow, sorry.
That was actually my FU of the week that kind of turned into a story of its own.
But that happens here on the show sometimes.
We have a couple more actual stories for you guys and then we're going to get into the calls of the week.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Just one minute though, don't start calling yet because we've got a couple more stories.
Loki.
Apparently the 3D games are going to be coming to the PlayStation Network very soon.
Of course you've probably seen commercials and stuff for 3D TVs on TV.
Um, including some from Samsung.
and they include Wipeout HD, MotorStorm Pacific Rift, Pain, Super Stardust HD and I guess those will all be available on the PlayStation Network at the same time.
Now granted though, these aren't all 3D.
It's kind of like portions of them.
Like Wipeout HD is actually supposed to be in full 3D.
Motorstorm Pacific Rift is supposed to have a level that's in 3D.
Pain has, I believe, three levels.
Not positive about Super Stardust HD, but it's kind of like...
I don't know, a little proof of concept games I guess Toagak in our chatroom says 3D is fucking overkill out the wazoo, you know I kind of agree I don't know, I don't know, then again maybe if I play it I'll change my mind but I already kind of said this earlier in the show I just, I don't know how I feel about everything shifting towards 3D quite rapidly might I add, like it's not just happening like slowly, it's happening fast it feels like, 3D's taking over fast, thank you Avatar
Me.
Just saying.
By the way, did you know Avatar's out on Blu-ray, what, the 22nd?
Earth Day.
Oh, is it Earth Day, really?
But.
But, what, yeah?
It's just the movie with none of the goodies.
You wait till November.
Interesting.
To get the Blu-ray that comes with all of the goodies.
This is more like, okay, here's your bone.
Well, I love the fact that they're marketing it with
Go Back to the World
Are you going to pick up Avatar?
Or you're going to wait, aren't you?
I'm going to wait.
I want the extra stuff, so I don't care.
I'll wait.
You'll be patient?
I've got Avatar.
I mean, I like the movie.
I thought it was great.
I see what you did there.
All right.
Let's get into one more story here, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
Oh, this is a very fitting last story of the day here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Where do I even go with this?
So there's this woman.
And she's from Manchester.
And she's talking Wii Fit this week.
And the reason why she's talking Wii Fit, she's blaming it because it turned her into a sex addict.
Yes, Wii Fit made me a sex addict on the next Oprah.
This 24-year-old, her name is Amanda Flowers.
I have to say, honestly, is this for real?
Because isn't there a porn star named Amanda Flowers?
If not, there ought to be.
It sounds like a very porn star name.
It sounds like a porny name, doesn't it?
I don't know.
We'll see.
Deflowered, number 50.
All right.
Well, anyhow.
Okay, so yeah, she fell off the balance board, and she claims that because of the stumble, she is now a sex addict.
She wants sex 10 times a day.
The slightest vibration in the air...
she says it begins as a twinge down below before surging through my body sometimes it built up into a trembling orgasm with no cure I just have to try to control my passion by breathing deeply hopefully one day I'll find a super stud who can satisfy me and I'm thinking here I'm like is this a fucking joke like is April Fool's still happening does someone not get the memo that April Fool's is supposed to be stuck to April 1st
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I was like, and just listening to this just makes me think of that episode.
I'm like, did she hit her head?
Did she fall on her cooch or something?
No, there is actually, it's a real... Did she hit herself in the labia?
I mean, what?
It's a real syndrome.
It's a persistent sexual arousal syndrome.
From falling off the Wii balance board?
I mean, I guess... I hate to bring back up that episode, but it was a head trauma that did it for the episode.
I don't know.
They picked things that are kind of far-fetched.
Hmm.
Let's see here.
Are you on the wiki?
No, I'm on the Boston University School of Medicine's sexual medicine, apparently.
Their sub page here.
Let's see.
It doesn't really say what the causes are.
Okay, whatever.
So it's a real thing.
I mean...
Head trauma and sex drive.
I'm immediately going to go home and fall off my Wii Fit board as many times as possible.
Head trauma and sex drive are connected since a person suffering from brain injury usually has a reduced sex drive.
Yeah, whatever.
Frisbee says in chat, if hitting your head makes you a sex addict, how is this Nintendo's fault?
You know, part of me wants to say this story really has nothing to do with Wii Fit.
Wait a second.
You know what this reminds me of?
And oh my God, I can't believe I'm thinking about this now.
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
What was that one movie that had, oh my god now, the guy that did Hairspray, John Waters, remember that John Waters movie where everyone was like a sexual deviant or whatever?
Desperate Living, and they get exiled to the town of Mortville, it's really disgusting, like it's the most disgusting movie ever made, is that what it is?
um I don't think it was that one but she like they were trying to figure out a new sex act or whatever oh oh uh uh you're trying it's a newer one it's um uh damn it it's the one I know what you're talking about they had that one girl and she had ginormous tits and Tracy Ullman was in it um I know what you're talking about it'll come a desperate no desperate living I already said
Somebody in chat will get, thank you, Lowdown Dirty Shame.
Yes, Lowdown Dirty Shame.
No, it's not.
Lowdown Dirty Shame was another movie.
Dirty Shame is the name of it.
It's Dirty Shame.
Anyways, it's like that because that was their kind of sex act that she would cause some sort of head trauma and then she became like a sex deviant.
That's right!
That was the whole point of that movie, huh?
Tracy Ullman gets in a car accident and then suddenly she's a sex addict.
Yes, a dirty shame.
Wow.
Well, I guess it's a dirty shame she fell off her Wii Fit board, huh?
Like I said, I'm going to go home and probably try to fall off my board as many times as possible.
Alright, Skype line is now open 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio The phones are open for business while we wait for some calls, last minute stories Anyone?
Gunblade is coming to the Wii They're going to do Gunblade New York and LA Machine Guns packed together kind of like what they did with House of the Dead 2 and 3 That makes me happy because I used to play the crap out of Gunblade at QZAR
I don't remember Gunblade.
They have like these giant machine guns that you would shoot stuff with and they would just constantly rumble as you're playing the game.
Alright, to the phones!
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Spazinator.
Hey, Spazinator, what is on your mind, my friend?
Yeah, you know, two things.
Before I get to that, I just want to say, with the live story you read off, I can just see
Every guy in America going out to store right now to buy Wii Fit for their girlfriend.
Actually, yeah, I was going to say, I thought you were going to say guys are going to run out and buy it.
Actually, most, and obviously I was joking earlier when I was talking about I'm going to go fall off the thing, but I think most guys already are sex addicts.
It's just that they're going to get this game for their girlfriends or wives and so forth and then spray Pam all over the Wii Fit board.
Or they don't even have to do that.
I mean, obviously it's just some hard surface or something.
And I want to know how she fell off the Wii Fit board.
All right, anyhow, I'm sorry, Spaz.
That's probably not why you were calling in tonight, but what's up?
Yeah, I was wondering, have you checked out the Flower soundtrack yet?
No, I think I do remember reading a story that it was available, but Flower had a great ambient soundtrack.
Remember how we had the story earlier tonight about the study about Modern Warfare 2 versus March of the Penguins and which one would make you fall asleep?
The Flower soundtrack would be a great thing to fall asleep to.
It's very nice ambient music.
Is that available to get now?
Yeah, in fact, it's been out for roughly a week and a half now.
In fact, just this past Friday, I ended up picking it up just for the hell of it, and it's pretty good.
Yeah, in fact, as you were kind of touching on there, ever since I got it, I've been using it to fall asleep to whenever I get a bad case of insomnia, so...
Which is pretty much on a regular basis Flower, by the way, is one of the best racing games I've played in the past year Yes, I consider it a racing game It plays like a racing game to me Play it for yourself, find out But I think it's a great support Oh my gosh, it's a beautiful game Just such a beautiful game You know, there was some controversy I guess Ebert spoke up again about another whole games as art controversy He came up again, he said Games are not art and they're never going to be art
It's funny because every blog story I see reporting on the news issue has got a picture of Flower to go with it.
It's kind of like the, oh, games can't be art, eh?
I wonder if there'll be a Flower 2.
We'll see.
Well, we'll probably get a Flower 2 or something similar pretty soon since all of these have been doing well.
Flower, Flow, so on and so forth.
I wouldn't doubt it.
Now,
Also, as per my usual day, I usually do every so often, there's one show that I discovered that I think you guys may like, especially one of our fellow listeners, DJ Ranma S. What's that?
It's called Toko.
It's...
It's a 12 episode anime series that's been out on cable TV and it's also available on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
It's kind of hard to describe.
It's kind of like a cross between The X-Files and Devil May Cry.
Interesting.
Yeah, it's, well, I've only seen the first four episodes so far, and based on, it's really kind of the same, what the whole series is like, but just based on what level I've seen so far, it seems pretty good.
There are a few racier moments in there that wouldn't necessarily be great for the younger crowd, but if you're old enough to handle that kind of thing, it's pretty good.
For us mature folks who can handle it.
All right, well, Spazinator, we'll have to check that out.
But for now, I'm going to let you go.
But thanks for the chat and lots of different topics tonight.
And you have a good week, okay?
Yep, you too.
Take care.
Alright, later.
By the way, a comment from our chat room from Seg wants to point out that.game.company, the people who make Flower, they don't do sequels, but they don't fail to make something new and beautiful.
And you know what?
I'm totally okay with that.
You know what?
Flower doesn't need a sequel necessarily, but it would be awesome if there was another game kind of in that same vein, just that very relaxing, beautiful...
All this talk about sex makes me want to just sit here and play a couple of age games.
Well, hello, DJ Ranma S. How are you?
Hey, I'm fine.
Spazinator was talking about a show he was recommending, Toko.
Have you heard of that?
No, I have not.
You might have to ask him about it.
He specifically said it was for you and us, but he said you might get a kick out of it.
Check it out.
You never know.
Well, I'm already working on a couple of anime titles right now, but that's not why I called.
All right.
Why did you call?
Surely you didn't call to talk about Wii Fit.
What's on your mind?
Do you remember a couple of years ago you guys talked about a Spanish DDR movie called La Machina de Bahia?
Yes, sadly enough, I do remember that.
Me and my friend Jerry watched it Friday night.
Really?
Yes.
Okay, so it's a Spanish movie about Dance Dance Revolution, basically, right?
Not really.
It's the campiest feel-good movie of the year, really.
of the two years ago, because the movie's been out a while.
Pretty much.
Alright, I have to ask, A, what possessed you to, of all things, watch La Magina de Balar, or whatever it's called?
It was sitting on my computer for about a year and a half, and my roommate was playing FF13, and getting him off the 360 is like getting the jaws of life, so I'm like, you know what, we might as well just watch the movie, and it was like, wow.
And?
Was it good?
It was pretty good.
I thought it was funny.
The plot of the movie is about this kid who loves playing DDR, works in a supermarket.
His boss asks him to watch his pet snake.
So he's like, yeah, sure.
His friends find out that he has this place to himself.
They bring chicks over and...
and DarkSakura.com
So it's kind of like The Wizard, right?
Weren't they entering the tournament to raise money to run away from home?
What were they doing?
I don't remember.
They were trying to raise money for something, and he entered the tournament.
Right?
Yes.
I see.
So it was basically The Wizard in Spanish, but with less Power Glove and more snakes.
And a lot more butterfly.
Goody, goody.
Alright, so thumbs up or thumbs down to, let me make sure I get this right, La Magina de Bailar.
Bailar.
That's how it is, and yes, I'd give it two thumbs up.
Bailar.
Sorry.
I give it two thumbs up with alcohol.
It's funny sober.
It's hilarious drunk because for some reason when I'm watching the movie, I have this tendency to point out indifferences.
In the movie, I'm pointing out, this is from DDR USA.
This is from Xtreme 2.
This is from Max.
I'm looking at the different screens.
I'm like, this is from this one and this is that one.
Ranma, it's because you're a nerd.
I'm just saying.
Damn right I am.
You're a fucking nerd.
And I love you for it, but you're a nerd.
I mean, you're not supposed to do that with nerd movies.
It's called the suspension of belief.
Well, maybe because it was so campy, my eyes just started looking at all the other stuff, you know?
Mm-hmm.
A true DDR nerd till you die.
I can respect that.
Anything else you want to talk about tonight that isn't about DDR and snakes?
Before I hang up, I want this heard.
I'm holding you to that.
What?
About WoW.
Okay, but I want to make it clear.
I want to make it very, very clear.
They need to put something out for sale that is basically a way to cheat.
I should say that the item sale would give somebody a clear advantage just by spending money for it.
because obviously you can already pay for faction transfers, you can pay for server transfers that's fine and dandy, I don't have a problem with that I don't have a problem with vanity items I'm going to have a problem when the item that you spend hours and hours to grind and get and raid for that gives you the bonus stats to intellect or whatever is suddenly available for $15 through Blizzard's website that is where I draw the line
Okay.
Alright, I just want to make it very clear, because I know how the listeners are, and every single item that comes out, they're going to say, oh, does Rob have to delete WoW now?
That's why I wanted you to say it, so everyone's all clear about it.
I don't care how many magical star ponies they put out, and you know what, if they put out a pink pony, I might have to do it.
I'm kidding, I'm not going to do it.
It depends on the price.
If it's $5, maybe.
But $25, Ranma, that's the other problem.
There's a big difference between $10 and $25.
Like $25 is like the price of a used game.
This just proves that people are sheep.
and I have friends that bought it and I feel bad saying this you know and even a friend a really good friend wanted to gift it to me and I'm like no please don't you don't you really no really you really really don't have to do that like I would like go buy yourself a bottle of vodka and a porno and have yourself a wonderful evening like I would rather you do that than buy me the star pony
Alright, anyhow Ranma, we gotta let you go, try to get some more calls But thank you so much No problem Bye As Actdeft points out, yes, it is a big difference It sure is a big difference I hate this Skype spam, look at this Wait, this Skype spam I got European and American women are too arrogant for you
Well, I know of one.
Are you looking for a sweet lady that will be caring and understanding?
Then you came to the right place.
I didn't come to you, bitch.
You're sending me a spam message.
Let's see.
Here you can find a Russian lady that will love you with all of her heart.
Can't find a queen to rule your heart?
How about beautiful Russian ladies?
I'm going to tell you right now.
Not all Russian women are sweet.
I want to point out, Loki married a Russian woman.
Not the kind that's being advertised here, just so you know.
No.
Big difference.
Big difference.
Nelly's an independent woman.
One more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Zaku!
What is on your mind, my friend?
Wait, but you're working, that's good, because I remember...
Yeah, I remember a time you were calling into the show and you were like, I'm unemployed, I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to do this.
But then you found a job, so all's better.
Well, I know how you are.
We all get a case of the Mondays, you know, no matter what.
It happens, it happens.
Even the people that are job hunting kind of go, oh, God, I hope this is the week.
You know, I know how it goes.
So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
Um, Activision's bullshit, that's what's on my mind tonight.
Is it the Star Pony bullshit, or is it Infinity Ward bullshit?
No, it's basically their executive trying to do their best to put lipstick on a pig regarding the whole Infinity Ward situation.
in particular, how he's defending that they get compensated better in Activision.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm sorry, when you said lipstick on a pig, I immediately went to that whole Sarah Palin thing.
I don't know why.
My mind just went to Sarah Palin.
I'm not calling her a name.
She said something about lipstick on a pitbull.
That's where my mind went.
The idea is that Activision is trying to whitewash something
basically their years of trying to milk the proverbial golden calf that was Infinity Ward when you milk somebody to the point of to the point of when you saturate the market and everything else because that's all it is, it's mediocrity it's a race to the bottom unfortunately and in this case Activision tries, they basically try to, they're running a slave ship in terms of
you know, not only Infinity Ward but other studios that have to churn out a new Call of Duty game every single year quality be damned
at the same time though Activision their their point in life or whatever is to make money and there's investors that are expecting that hold on investors expecting them to make money and return on investment etc etc blah blah blah so you know in all these people are quitting left and right in I believe Activision is based in California which would be an at-will employment state or wherever they are obviously they're not signed to contracts because they are quitting left and right
what else can Activision do but come out and say well don't worry everything's going to be okay even though they might be pooping their pants behind the scenes because they have investors to make happy at the end of the day and they're going to say of course this will be a great game oh these people are just going to be better off where they're at and we're much better because of it and then behind the curtain they're like oh my god what are we going to do alright one thing is basically having to meet the demands of their investors and as a public company they have to but that's only short term
What they should be focusing on is long term returns.
Basically long term return on investment which is really hard to do because you need to be more original.
in terms of finding new ideas that would stretch out even further.
Making another multi-million dollar franchise.
It's not just milking the current ones you have.
And this is the problem with not only the business world in particular, but Activision and the fact that they're so short-sighted.
EA basically woke up from that nightmare a few years back and actually started making more original properties.
More original games.
And as a result,
They're still a publicly traded company, but they have a lot more in their portfolio in terms of actually franchises.
And they don't basically milk them every... They don't have to meet the 10-month deadline for new games.
So maybe this will just come full circle, Zaku?
I mean, you said it yourself.
Yeah, I'm thinking Activision has to eventually reach a point where their mediocrity is going to bite them in the ass.
And that's a fact.
That day is coming.
The day will have...
The day will come when people just realize that they're getting raped, they're getting hoodwinked every single year with the same bullshit, with the same game that offers very little in terms of fresh new content.
I am really curious to see what happens this year, Zaku.
Being the music game fan, and I know you're in this boat too, I'm very curious to see what happens at the end of the year with Guitar Hero 6 or whatever they end up putting out, because you know it's going to happen, versus Rock Band 3.
Because especially when you take into light this whole lawsuit and all this other business going on right now, I'm very curious to see how the... And I guess it's come out that Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero and all that didn't sell too hot.
of course I'm really curious to see if Rock Band kicks it down or what happens
I mean, the reason, you have to give it to Harmonix, that they actually took something that has never been marketed that well, like the Beatles catalog.
And they actually made a boatload of money as a result.
I know it was a license, but still, that was a major license.
Well, here's the first thing that they've done right so far this year.
It's been almost four months now, and we haven't had a guitar release yet this year, so... Well, that makes sense.
That and the fact that Harmonix is not like
Not like trying to claw their way to get another Rock Band version out next year.
It's been almost, what, more than a year since we had Rock Band 2, and all they're doing is just shoveling new content.
Which is good, because it's better to have people continue buying the current version and then just focusing on delivering more DLC.
Because that's really the heart of the game, the music.
Alright, well, Zaku buddy, we're going to let you go, but some good thoughts on that, and we'll see what happens.
I think you're right, I think the cycle will come full circle, and somebody else will be the big bad evil dude next year.
At least the folks of Infinity Ward broke out when they had the chance, and so now that they're back in TGA, at least this time, they're not going to get screwed over and be whipped to...
to chunk out, you know, to turn out Call of Duty games or any new IP that they have every annual.
All right.
Well, we will see what happens.
All right, Zaku, we're going to let you go, buddy, but you have a good one.
Have a good one.
Later.
Alright, I think that's going to do it for the Skype calls tonight.
And somebody in chat making a very good point.
Did you notice that every New York listener got in tonight?
Isn't that weird?
Like, I guess technically Spazinator is in New York City, but he's in Buffalo, which is still upstate New York.
So tonight was a very New York state of mind in many ways.
So I don't know what you New Yorkers are doing with your phones, but y'all got in.
Even SSJ100Matt, we called him.
He's in New York too.
Go figure.
I think they just really want me to come visit.
That's what you want, right?
I really want to go back to New York.
I really do.
We'll see.
Hopefully soon.
My friend doesn't live there anymore, so I have to go.
I'll have to crash at Ranma's house.
We'll see if he likes that.
Alright, anyhow.
We are going to start to wrap up here because it's about 9.30 here on the West Coast.
It's been kind of a long show night, at least three hours if not more.
So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight and be on our way out of here for the night.
So let's go around and make sure there's no more last minute stories.
I don't know if Loki has anything else he wants to state.
3DS?
3DS?
Well, who knows.
Apparently there was a trademark registered by Konami Digital Entertainment for something with the title of Harmony of Despair.
If that doesn't sound like a Castlevania title, I don't know what is.
Yeah, it sounds pretty Castlevania to me.
Apparently Jam with the Band on the DS is coming to Europe.
That game was originally only released in... Didn't that come out like two years ago?
In Japan, yeah.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
Yeah, it's never been released over here or in Europe, so they're going to be getting that.
And with a bunch of new songs, I guess.
A bunch of covers like ABC, Chariots of Fighter, I'm a Slave for You, Material Girl, among other things.
And of course some Nintendo original songs including an F-Zero medley, NES Classics medley, Legend of Zelda medley, Super Mario Kart medley, Super Mario medley, and Onigashima medley.
I gotta be honest, a lot of this sounds pretty good.
And let's see here.
Nintendo has actually won an appeal against Anescape in their suit saying that they had a patent for, I guess, the Wave Bird and the classic controllers and whatnot.
So that's kind of cool.
Unfortunately, they have been sued again by somebody else.
Now, IA Labs...
apparently is going to be suing them because of a fitness game, Power Grid Fitness, I guess, has... They're saying that it infringes on their patent for it.
And apparently they said that they also approached Nintendo with the idea in the first place, so...
Crazy Taxi Quake Arena Arcade What? !
Quake Arena Arcade Yes That was already announced, I think, a while ago On Xbox?
Yeah, it's going to have 16 player online battles with 40 original maps.
Get your trash talker ready, Matt.
Some other titles, of course, on the way that apparently are appearing on PartnerNet as well.
Metal Slug XX, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, Raystorm HD, Sonic Adventure DX, The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match, Quake Arena Arcade,
Crazy Taxi, Bali, Card Game, and Doom 2, the arcade version.
Doom 2 arcade version.
And the first five of those titles, if you know where to look, have already been leaked out.
All right.
Very cool.
Lots of good stuff in there.
That's it for Last Minute Stories, then, Loki?
That's it.
We've had a really full show tonight.
I'm really out of stuff, too.
All right.
That's why I'm sitting on the floor again.
I know.
Well, I noticed you're working on your decoupage, so I figured you had to be out of things.
Are you going to take a status picture for our chatters to see?
I am, once I actually have something worth status.
I'm actually doing extra layers of glue on the back to hold down these loose ends.
But I'll tell you, there's Xbox stuff I'm excited about coming out.
What's that?
I want to play No More Heroes.
Ah, very nice.
I see your Dicapage pictures are already up on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
Very nice.
Very nice.
They've replaced the pictures of Matt with the double down last week, which is good because I was sick of looking at that thing.
Or me with the nose pond.
Yeah, you with the nose pond.
That was really bad but funny from that episode.
Oh, that was the week Loki missed.
Oh, boy.
You should be very glad you had family things to tend to that night.
What happened?
All right.
DarkSakura had this thing in her nose that she used for her sinus things and it looked like she was shoving a tampon in her nose.
And so we were calling it a nose pond.
It's the Vicks inhaler.
I dared her to take a picture and put it on the website and she did it.
I looked crazy.
You know that Jamie doesn't like pictures of her.
She's very picky choosy about what she lets out on the internet.
She's like, I'll take one because I know I look shitty today.
I like glue Loki, your final thought for our listeners tonight
Why is Ranma coming to Sacramento and going to kidnap Ron?
Uh-oh.
He's coming to stay with me.
When is he coming?
I need to make sure I'm available.
For explosions.
Is Patty coming too?
Yes.
Oh, 4th of July, right?
Yes.
Okay, then I will make sure I'm available.
Explosion day!
That's what we should rename it.
Are they going to be here for Pride the week before?
No.
Guys, you need to rearrange your schedule and get here the week before.
That's Pride.
Rob, you need to take me because I haven't been to a function yet.
It'll be fun.
All I've been is to the street fair.
It's on my birthday this year, though, so I don't know how I feel about that.
I'll have to get you dinner.
We'll see.
All right, anyhow, we're done.
We're out.
My final thought is, I don't know, I just ate a whole bag of cinnamon sugar pita chips during the show because I'm fat, huh?
All right, that's it.
We're out of here.
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show, downloading, listening live, however you're doing it, supporting independent podcasting.
You know what we say every week?
All we ask, if you enjoy the show, tell a person, tell two people, post a nice review on iTunes.
Just help us spread the word.
We don't have ads in the show yet.
I always say yet because you never know.
We might want to someday, but if we haven't for eight years, I mean, shit.
Who's going to buy the ad space on the show?
We certainly don't ask for any money from you, and we're not going to ask for any money from you to do this show or what have you.
So all we ask is just help spread the word.
That's all we want.
Thank you guys so much for downloading and wasting your Sunday evening with us.
We really appreciate it.
Have a wonderful week.
We'll be back to do it all again next week.
Yes, we'll be here next week.
Next week, I've got Conan O'Brien live on Friday, so I know I'll definitely talk about that, even though that really has nothing to do with games.
I've got a few weeks.
Loki wanted me to talk about that, so I will.
What else is going on next week?
I've got Rocky and lots of games, I'm sure.
Lots more Magic Sword, Double Impact, and also World of Warcraft, because my characters... I have lots of games to play.
