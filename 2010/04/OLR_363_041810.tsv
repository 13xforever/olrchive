10285	21061	Sky, and Loki Tonight, April 18th, 2010 PlayStation Network releases are on the move Does playing violent video games impact your sleep?
21462	24026	And how can you get free soundtracks from recent releases?
31761	40125	Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 363 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
40565	46608	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46728	48309	Does it count if I only have half a voice?
49269	53870	You know, I just got this feeling coming in here tonight, DarkSakura, that you really weren't prepared for tonight's episode.
54190	54791	And that's okay.
54971	55871	We all have our off days.
56231	57991	But let me paint a picture for the listeners.
58291	59012	Just imagine, if you will.
59432	68174	You know, I get here to Jamie's house, and I usually get here about an hour before showtime, because we have to prep the intro and get the mixing board set up and all the things that have to happen to make a show work.
68534	69234	I wasn't naked.
69634	70414	No, you weren't naked.
70935	71375	Thank God.
71395	71755	Okay.
72795	78278	The minute I walk in the door and I start to kind of walk back towards the room, Jamie's like, oh, hold on a minute.
78418	80639	And she runs to the bathroom like she's the Flash.
80779	81519	Oh, do not.
82940	88202	She runs to the bathroom like the Flash and I'm like, oh, I guess she just had Taco Bell for lunch or something.
88702	94805	And she comes out and she's carrying something and she runs into a room and I'm like, what is going on?
94845	99887	And she's like, sorry, I just I didn't want you to see my unmentionables drawing in the bathroom.
103349	104050	Girl, please.
104210	105411	I've never seen a bra before.
105491	109955	I might be gay, but it doesn't mean that... But I am modest.
110035	110536	No, I know.
110876	112097	I'm a very modest person.
113198	117002	I may be immodest in personality, but I make up for it in personal modesty.
118403	122486	And she probably doesn't appreciate me telling that story on the air, but it's funny, and that's what's most important.
122506	123246	You're worse than my mother.
123427	123707	Alright.
124507	128230	Also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
128530	128790	Hello.
129191	133554	Thankfully I have not seen his unmentionables hanging up to dry, even though we lived together for a couple years.
133654	135395	He was very good about folding his laundry.
135415	136436	It's because we had a dryer.
136476	137756	And promptly putting it away, yes.
138337	138717	Okay.
139077	141479	You can't put a bra in the dryer.
141699	142480	It warps.
143060	143640	Exactly.
143781	145562	Didn't we learn anything from watching Hedwig?
145582	145682	No.
146453	149922	We put bras in the dryer all the time and it's just fine.
150002	151907	Yeah, you don't do it when you pay 50 bucks for them.
152008	152489	Alright, anyhow.
153959	162683	Alright Once in a while we talk about video games here on this program Not just drying bras But how was your week, Loki?
163204	170647	Tons of the young male demographic really want to know how to wash a bra It's important life skills You know what?
170947	171347	You know what?
171367	172868	Wait till you're married You know what?
172908	176330	You'll get a woman to sleep with you like that If you know how to do her laundry Seriously
176710	180914	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
202394	204155	So, it's a really large store.
204195	206276	Like, they have magazines on the first floor.
206796	211497	And, you know, you can get a copy of Famitsu there, manga, an entire Yaoi section, which is pretty impressive.
211837	215419	But they have some funny, like, English books upstairs, like gift gag books.
215779	216659	Like, one little section.
216699	219020	And one of the books I saw was Porn for Women.
219960	225482	And you open it up and it's just, like, pictures of guys, like, not, like, no, I mean, they're clothed and everything.
225522	227983	But it's, like, a guy holding a baby saying, like...
228323	232929	Gosh, why don't I take care of the child for an hour so you can go out to a movie or something?
233029	234110	Or vacuuming.
234511	235412	Yeah, a guy's vacuuming.
235432	236453	Half-naked vacuuming.
237715	238696	And you know what?
238716	242661	I don't really think that many of those guys are super attractive because they're too muscular, you know?
243502	243803	I like a...
245239	246500	I like a David Bowie.
246660	247600	You like him a little nerdy.
247961	249161	I like him a little androgynous.
249301	249562	All right.
249642	249942	All right.
250142	250522	Anyhow.
252443	254384	And I married Dan who was like so completely dude.
254404	258087	Yeah, Dan doesn't exactly strike this androgynous.
258107	259207	Dan's a bit of a broad.
259227	259868	Dan fights with me.
262429	266051	And you know what the song is, Break Up to Make Up?
267432	267632	No.
267752	268433	Well, hey-o.
268493	268653	Hey.
268693	269393	No, no, no, no.
269433	269713	All right.
269753	271494	Well, let's get into video games.
271615	271795	All right.
273004	277805	and start off the show as we usually do, not with a bra discussion or cherry blossom discussion.
278145	278805	For the record.
279045	279245	What?
280065	280886	It's a really comfy bra.
282806	283946	How was your gaming week?
284146	284506	Help.
284646	286587	Oh wait, I have to say this spiel about the chat room.
287067	292788	We do tape live every week on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com at 6 Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
292948	296289	If you are listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room.
296309	297889	If we haven't scared you off yet, congratulations.
298129	299970	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
300030	301410	Jamie, how was your gaming week?
301810	303251	I did lots of gaming, Rob.
304192	309275	I've beaten Eskbaluga Whale 2.
311836	313737	Why do I want to add another syllable there?
314017	317420	Eskbaluda 2.
317760	318700	Twice on my iPhone.
319961	321762	It is amazing on the iPhone.
322723	324384	It is seriously easy to control.
326002	329464	Very, very, very, very, very, very overwhelmingly Japanese.
330285	332046	As in, they didn't bother translating it, just the text.
333427	335788	And in fact, the endings have a little bit of anguish in them.
335828	336669	I think it's hilarious.
337529	338530	And it's just fun.
338890	339450	It's really fun.
339470	342232	You have two modes with three difficulties.
345334	347295	I've just been playing in novice mode just to get used to it, of course.
347315	348056	So of course I beat it.
349216	356479	But in novice mode, you have auto-fire on, and you only have your, what is it, your enlightened attack or something?
356959	366283	And then you've got another thing open for regular mode, and then all of your selections open, including your fire on the other.
366683	369745	But really, I just like shooting stuff, and it's a gorgeous game.
369825	370465	It is gorgeous.
370945	378491	I've actually, on my Twitter, I've put a few, actually probably my last three TwitPic posts have been pictures of the game.
379392	380713	So it's pretty epic.
381161	384083	I find I've been really neglecting my Twitter these past couple weeks.
384464	385544	Like, I've just been very bad.
385564	386865	That's what happens when you're getting it.
386885	389207	Which is, no, it has nothing to do with that.
389707	393150	I think it has to do with the fact that I'm having, I mean, here's the thing.
393370	402957	There's a lot of great OLR listeners that follow me on Twitter and I want to share, especially like the gamey related things and, you know, funny life stories and little, you know, vignettes and little things.
403558	404338	I like that word.
404438	405079	Yes, vignettes.
405099	406000	It's a fun word to say.
406060	407461	Vignette in 140.
407941	408862	Is that the brand of your bra?
408902	409282	Vignette?
409742	410123	Vignette.
410743	433034	140 characters or less but here's the thing my bra is comfy I'm having a hard time justifying my continued existence and participation on a website where Justin Bieber is the number one topic of discussion every single day like I kind of feel like on moral grounds I kind of object
433334	433874	You know what, Rob?
433915	434935	I don't pay attention to that shit.
434995	436797	It makes life a lot better.
436837	438838	Whenever you go to Twitter.com, trending topics.
439118	440019	Justin Bieber!
440059	440840	Well, here's why.
440880	443862	It's because half the people are like, you know, fawning over him.
443902	445984	The other half are like, who's Justin Bieber?
446004	447705	I really don't know who that is anyway.
448305	449967	I don't look at the trending topics.
451427	455288	I still want to get President Cat as a trending topic.
456449	457909	We tried that a long time ago.
458309	462310	It got us a mention on some of the game blogs but it didn't get trending topics.
463511	464111	They're buttholes.
464491	467232	Love, love, love, love.
468015	469356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
490615	493056	So I'm going to give it a plug because I can.
494216	506440	The temple that I go to here in Sacramento, or Orangevale technically, Temple Orishon is having a fundraiser, big, big fundraiser in the area on Sunday the 25th.
506660	507640	It's called All That Jazz.
507820	508540	Just look it up online.
509501	510321	Big fundraiser.
510961	513002	20s, 30s, 40s themed kind of roundabout.
513482	514802	And I'm doing their newsletter.
515503	519784	I'm doing a big newspaper for them as a giveaway to everyone who comes in, you know.
520604	523725	So that's what I've been tearing my hair out over and I was sick.
524545	527166	So if you're in the area, come share a lime with DarkSakura.
527547	529447	Spend a good 60 bucks and go.
530708	531508	It's a fundraiser.
531528	532288	It's for a good cause.
532648	535309	But as a result, I've had no life.
535669	537410	And I have been sick on top of it.
537650	540471	And I'm actually feeling a lot better today than I did.
540631	542012	My voice is coming and going.
542092	543572	But I've been sick.
544272	546513	So while I've been sick, I've been working on this.
547394	548614	So, yeah.
551318	557002	Tiger Claw in our chat room links us to a Wikipedia article on Justin Bieber because of course, Wiki will solve everything.
557022	558143	But let me put it in a nutshell.
558424	560445	You know what Donny Osmond was like 30 years ago?
560745	562387	He was so Mormon.
562507	566550	Oh, this guy's like... That's basically what Justin Bieber is now.
566750	567731	He has hat hair.
568972	571434	Anyway, please, no more Justin Bieber talk on this program.
571454	572314	He has hat hair.
572435	576738	And then Shaoran says, if you have that much of a problem with it, then maybe you should stop using Twitter.
576958	578920	Shaoran, that's exactly what's happened the past couple weeks.
580084	584508	I've been Facebooking, and now Foursquare is the other one I use, which I really shouldn't use.
584628	588351	I'm going to get posted on PleaseRobMe.com, but I'm kind of addicted to it.
588571	589272	I can't explain it.
589612	590673	It's partially a game.
591153	592855	They made a game out of social networking.
593575	593916	I don't know.
594176	594716	You know what?
594956	596277	I pretty much stick with my Facebook.
596297	599240	Look, at least I gave up Farmville, so I think I deserve props for that.
599280	606606	I'm trying to pay more attention to Twitter, because as I was telling you yesterday about my plan to become a true nothing celebrity...
608149	610790	You know, I want to be famous for absolutely nothing, like Paris Hilton.
612751	614612	Except I'm not going to put my twat on the internet.
614712	615612	But you have to be rich.
617113	618353	Well, that's what sponsorship's for.
618454	619274	Not necessarily.
619334	620154	Tila Tequila.
620615	624537	I mean, I look at her and I go, well, someone remind me why she's famous.
624697	625777	I could have eight babies at once.
628358	630219	But no, I'm going for Warhol famous.
636687	636967	I don't know.
653672	655352	I'm gonna finish working on my cork board.
678038	680120	I tried No More Heroes Paradise, or whatever the hell it's called in Japan.
680141	682823	It's the 360 port of No More Heroes, the game on the Wii.
699902	703443	and I gotta say, I like it better on the 360 than on the Wii.
704524	706364	It just seemed easier for me to control.
706424	713387	Granted, it's not as fun as slashing people to death, but it is still pretty cool the way you do a lot of the moves.
713467	718229	So in place of swinging the Wii remote, you actually use the...
720501	721583	Thank you for watching!
737405	739847	and you have the choice between English or Japanese dialogue.
739867	744611	The problem is they did not sync up the mouth movements to the English dialogue.
744651	750455	It's only synced up the Japanese dialogue and I mean it is way off for the English dialogue.
750936	762504	But it's a fun game overall and I mean I played the original on the Wii so it's kind of just rehashed stuff for me but I'm enjoying it quite a bit so hopefully I'll be able to play my way through that.
764607	775463	and then I played a little bit on the arcade cabinet broke out some Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Capcom vs. SNK 2 so that was pretty fun
776528	780671	I'm sorry to derail you for a minute, Loki, because I do love Capcom vs. SNK as well.
780691	781992	But I need to talk to Jamie for a minute.
782392	784914	Is that glue that you're putting down there?
785194	787015	Okay, Jamie's working on an art project.
787455	788656	Are you putting these pictures on the website?
788676	790177	Yeah, I'm going to do it on the website.
790537	792879	So Jamie's working on an art project during the show, which is fine.
793219	795941	But she's using a lot of glue.
796501	800084	And I want to remind the listeners, we're in kind of an enclosed space here in the studio.
800104	800924	It's not stinky glue.
800964	805888	So we're all currently inhaling glue during this show as if we weren't crazy enough.
806588	813952	Right now, check again in about 15 minutes and see if... I've got it right under my nose because I'm holding the damn mic.
813992	815213	Great, you of all people.
815393	819375	And for the record, the stuff that I'm using is Mod Podge.
819835	822676	And looks like a Yoplait yogurt container.
822917	824938	It does, a little bit, but not safe for you.
824958	826659	I was like, why are you rubbing yogurt on that?
826679	828519	It's so weird.
829140	833242	Alright, did you have anything else you wanted to say about your gaming week, Loki?
834023	835825	Um... No.
836606	838048	That's basically all I played this week.
838509	843916	I wanted to go back to Final Fantasy XIII, but I was talking to my friend who's actually at the same point in the game.
844317	849404	Actually, his wife already finished Final Fantasy XIII, and it's just kind of like...
851025	851886	It sounds annoying.
852827	863897	He's like, ah, the ending sucked, and you just put you back before the game's over, and you don't really get to see the results of your actions and that kind of stuff.
863937	865939	So I'm like, eh, that sounds kind of disappointing.
866059	868862	But I will finish it eventually so I don't have to play it anymore.
870503	873606	That's kind of sad, because X-2 had a freaking epic ending.
873959	878303	Yeah, I'm curious to see what the... Yeah, but you had to suffer through the whole game in order to see that ending.
878584	885570	I will say though, Final Fantasy related, speaking of like XI and all these other games, a lot of stuff is leaking out on XIV because the Alpha is going on right now.
885610	889174	So if you really know where to look, there's a lot of like videos and even the soundtrack.
889194	892057	And I wish I brought it to the show with me tonight, but unfortunately I don't have it.
892077	892957	I'll have to bring it next week.
893198	897181	Some of the soundtrack for the Alpha is leaked and it looks really good.
897822	899904	Magic Sword Double Impact Magic Sword Double Impact
919257	920979	I think actually they're selling it as another name.
921219	923680	I think like Final Fight or some other game nobody played.
924101	925322	But no, I'm kidding.
925362	926022	I'm kidding.
926442	927343	Love Final Fight.
927803	929224	I just love Magic Sword more.
929505	936990	So I was very excited to hear that the game was being re-put out basically on Xbox Live.
937790	950120	What I really like that they did with it is that they didn't make it just a freaking dump of the ROM onto the marketplace with maybe some slightly enhanced graphics.
950660	953642	Now, sadly, there aren't really enhanced graphics.
953662	961548	You're not going to get Bionic Commando rearmed style graphics suddenly out of Final Fight or Magic Sword, but you do have different filters.
961829	964751	In fact, there's this one very interesting, the default mode that you play is...
965211	969794	It tries to make the screen look like an old arcade screen.
969854	971455	So like it has a curvature to it.
972336	973757	It's very interesting the way they do it.
973777	974557	It looks awesome.
974657	976639	I couldn't really play the game that way.
977079	983884	I had to just put it in normal ROM, no filter, just the way I remember it mode, which is nice because that's there.
984164	988547	So for the purists like me or whatever, elitists, whatever you want to call me, my mode is there.
988567	989207	So that makes me happy.
990688	992029	Remix soundtrack is there too.
992089	994831	I believe it was the same team that did,
995131	1016470	Bionic Commando, don't quote me on that one of the other recent Capcom games did that so it has a remixed soundtrack and of course Magic Sword which I played mostly through the week was just as great as I remember it many years ago and if you've never played Magic Sword before well first I should say Final Fight it is the flagship game no matter if I think otherwise or not
1016790	1023512	Final Fight is one of those kind of beat-em-up type of games in the style of Double Dragon or Ninja Turtles.
1023873	1026874	But I think Final Fight was – or Streets of Rage, I guess, if you will.
1027134	1033956	But I think Final Fight was kind of known for just having somewhat more memorable characters and some memorable story.
1034316	1040038	And I think it was just kind of an iconic sort of arcade game that was out in the early 90s.
1040078	1045040	And I know DarkSakura, myself, and probably Loki all remember from kind of growing up in the pizza parlor and so forth.
1045660	1047161	Final Fight Collection Final Fight Guy
1067791	1081233	where you can have people, random people on the internet just drop in at any time like walk up to the machine, put in a quarter basically and drop into your game at any time a la Street Fighter 4, I guess you could say had a mode like that, but thankfully it's also very easy to turn that off
1081761	1092128	So again, I just say props to the team there at Capcom for not just dumping the ROMs and putting them out on the marketplace, but really kind of going back and touching them up.
1092568	1093709	Did they redo the graphics?
1094069	1100193	No, but I think they were able to do a good port economically, probably.
1100213	1106958	This was probably a very economic port that they did, and they're probably going to make crap tons of money off of it, so props to Capcom.
1107458	1110980	And I do approve, especially if you remember Magic Sword and Final Fight.
1111320	1112461	I think the games are done very well.
1112501	1114742	I don't think $10 is too much to ask for both games.
1115662	1118624	I think there's a lot of people that are going to be kind of one or the other.
1119304	1119584	I don't know.
1119624	1120505	I'm a little bit of both.
1120705	1124446	As much as I joke that Magic Sword's better, I definitely fondly remember Final Fight.
1125507	1128829	But if you never played these games growing up, at least check out the demo for heaven's sake.
1129609	1130069	So there you go.
1132050	1132390	Let's see.
1133590	1137151	Salacious Pop in chat says something reminiscent of Magic Sword here.
1137231	1151454	I recall spending three hours and at least $25 on Magic Sword with my BFF at the arcade and beating it from scratch and having my BFF take the dark orb at the end from the final boss instead of destroying it and becoming the new evil whatever.
1151594	1155855	OMG, spoiler, and my 15-year-old self was pissed and the credits rolled.
1156255	1158016	I believe that's actually an achievement now.
1158137	1161799	I believe if you actually take the Dark Orb at the end, that's the way you get one of the achievements.
1161839	1163400	But yeah, you have to work there from the beginning.
1163440	1167824	It's not like the Super Nintendo version that let you start on whatever floor you wanted to, basically.
1168104	1174729	Because if you ever played the Super Nintendo one, which is a pretty faithful translation, as was Final Fight, you could start on pretty much any floor.
1174809	1175909	But not in this one.
1175949	1177170	You have to start from the beginning.
1177210	1179832	You can continue, and you don't have to do it all in one sitting.
1180533	1180613	So...
1181033	1181773	Yep, props to that.
1181933	1183754	But that was really the only new, new game I played this week.
1183794	1186495	Everything else is kind of something I've talked about before on the show.
1186615	1190417	So that's going to do it for my gaming week.
1190457	1193078	Getting into housekeeping a little bit before we start the gaming news tonight.
1193098	1195139	Not a whole lot tonight for housekeeping.
1195179	1197180	Just want to plug the Twitter and the Facebook, of course.
1197240	1198881	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1199261	1201982	And we're also on Facebook as well at Orange Lounge Radio.
1202022	1205524	Please friend us or tell some of your friends to add us too.
1205584	1209385	Help us spread the word about our little program because we can't afford to do commercials.
1210746	1213907	All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight.
1214027	1216387	Loki's going to start us off with a little bit of gaming news.
1216628	1218928	Actually, a lot of gaming news surrounding one company, right?
1219088	1223169	Well, it's all kind of tying together, and it's all very similar.
1223629	1237393	So you may remember there was a little bit of suing and counter-suing with Infinity Ward or the ex-heads of Infinity Ward and, of course, Activision over some non-paid royalties.
1238013	1246798	Well, now they made an announcement that they are starting their own studio called Respawn Entertainment and they will be partnered with EA.
1246958	1249039	So, kind of almost that, you know...
1250717	1256718	The whole thing was Activision was saying that they're going to go off and take their brand with them to their own studio.
1257859	1262060	Partnered with EA is sort of true, but they're not really taking any brands with them.
1262140	1265981	They're basically going to be doing brand new games, new franchises, and that kind of stuff.
1267461	1268001	So it's really neat.
1268041	1276103	And right now, of course, the only two members of this new studio are Jason West and Vince Zapanelli.
1276963	1277124	And...
1279384	1282666	They didn't really give any information other than the fact that they're hiring.
1284047	1288970	They aren't, I don't believe, allowed to be hiring the ex-Infinity War people.
1289070	1291011	Those guys have been leaving, though.
1291051	1293793	There's actually quite a few people leaving all throughout the week.
1294674	1297876	Starting off, let's see, we had...
1300417	1305500	Oh, a few different developers or programmers.
1305760	1315286	We had John Shiring and a senior animator, Bruce Fares, both confirmed that they're leaving Infinity Ward.
1315827	1322411	And then also the lead designer, Mackie McKendlish, has also left the company as well.
1323671	1326073	There was also some other guys leaving.
1326893	1356197	um let's see some more lead designers um Zeed Reek uh Steve uh Fukudo and uh some programmers uh Rainn Wilson or Winson and uh I was gonna say isn't Rainn Wilson on The Office no Rainn Winson and uh Chris uh looks like uh Sharubi and I guess he was another lead artist so they've had a lot of different artists and stuff leaving and what not um
1357825	1369793	And of course, to top it all off, Activision, there was one of the execs made a comment about the conditions that they provide for their studios.
1370434	1378840	And according to Activision, because we have to believe them now, the chief operating and financial officer, Thomas Tippel,
1380520	1380720	L.A.
1380760	1383241	Times Company Town Blog
1403448	1408089	and then further he says that we treat our developers extremely well.
1408869	1417771	Independent Studio, or I continue, I guess, the Activision's Independent Studio model allows developers a lot of creative freedom while we take care of the back office stuff.
1418752	1422753	Unfortunately, that's not exactly how they were painting the picture, so I don't really know...
1425354	1429215	There's definitely a little bit of he said, she said going on.
1429436	1433157	I think they just need to go on Tyra and work it out.
1433317	1434138	It's like a divorce.
1434418	1446003	There was some comments saying that basically that the studio behind Modern Warfare is dead from one of the insiders, I guess, at Infinity Ward.
1446224	1448365	His comment was, they're scared shitless.
1449065	1451306	They never saw this coming.
1451706	1453267	He's referring to Activision.
1453927	1455148	They can't believe what's going on.
1455188	1461874	At first, they gave us some bullshit about moving up payments, all the money that they owed us to sooner increments.
1462575	1469921	That was when designer Todd Alderman and engineer Frank Galletti left.
1470442	1475026	But then the announcement of Respawn and then all the people leaving, they just got their heads in their hands.
1476047	1476187	And...
1477848	1480150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1497285	1498286	Thanks for watching!
1514952	1517353	you know how I'd like to see this whole thing resolved how
1546943	1554169	This is the plaintiff, Bobby Kotek, CEO of an evil empire video game company.
1555810	1562956	He's accused of being a douchebag who doesn't know how to run his studios, but he says he knows how to run them just fine and gives them the perfect environment to make games in.
1562976	1564258	Wouldn't he be the defendant?
1565098	1565999	Oh yeah, he'd be the defendant.
1566319	1567400	Ah, I screwed it all up, never mind.
1567520	1569782	This is why I'm not a lawyer, I'm just a schmo on a video game show.
1570223	1574226	But no, I mean, this is all, it's very interesting how this is all playing out in public.
1575891	1578993	Yeah, um... I... I don't know.
1579133	1585938	The problem I see is, you know, they're saying one... Well, Activision's saying one thing, how they, you know, give their studios creative freedom and stuff.
1586018	1590241	And then, at the same time, we see the Call of Duty franchise split between three studios now.
1591081	1603990	And, you know, all this... The reasoning why they wanted to leave or, I guess, were made to leave is because they wouldn't, you know... They didn't have that creative freedom and they refused to, I guess, go along with what their plans were.
1604591	1604771	So...
1606684	1607044	I don't know.
1607665	1613850	It just sounds like a big mess and unfortunately I think Activision might suffer a little bit for it.
1616312	1619355	Tigerclaw says this needs the law and order gavel.
1620916	1621497	There you go.
1626064	1626484	I don't know.
1627805	1632167	I saw a video a couple days ago, and I thought you were going to get to it, but I guess maybe you didn't see it.
1632747	1633107	I saw it.
1633167	1638790	That showed the credits of Infinity Ward, and it just shows the red lines through all the people that have left.
1639190	1650395	And while there does seem to be quite a few people that are still there, it's kind of like a lot of the testers and sort of the, I hate to use insulting words, but kind of like the lower entry-level positions seem to mostly be the ones that are still there.
1650776	1652937	And then most of the higher-ups, though, are out.
1652977	1653077	Yeah.
1654198	1669078	and you gotta really wonder what the long term impact's gonna be I mean, you know, Modern Warfare 2 is a huge game and whereas, you know, I'm sure they'll be I mean, they got, Activision got another studio to make Guitar Hero 3 Well, let me put it this way So somebody else will do Modern Warfare but it's definitely gonna be different
1669218	1669739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1688861	1708947	and you may still see Infinity Ward continue on but I have a feeling there's going to be a lot more people leaving and especially if they drag this out long enough and they are not paying their employees the royalties that are due you'll probably see a lot of these people that are kind of sticking out start to question whether they're going to leave or not so I have a feeling this is just going to keep on going
1710839	1716588	It's going to be very interesting to see what kind of game comes out this Christmas if there is a Modern Warfare game at all.
1716628	1719933	I imagine there's got to be, but I'm just interested to see how it's going to be different.
1720233	1721695	It's just going to be another Call of Duty game.
1721715	1723919	I thought they were working on a Vietnam one or something like that.
1725281	1726683	Oh yeah, that's right, because every other year, huh?
1726980	1735986	Yeah, and all they're going to do is just use the same engine that Infinity Ward created, but Treyarch will be the one putting together the game, so it'll be another world of war.
1736427	1738508	And what happens to the former employees?
1738528	1740850	Do you think some of them are banding together to form a new studio?
1741030	1742351	And what will they make games like?
1743331	1746634	Actually, the people they're leaving are not going to that Respawn Entertainment.
1746694	1753619	I think mainly because it's part of the clause that they can't hire those people right now.
1753819	1754880	It's a non-compete thing.
1754960	1756861	It's got to be good on the resume.
1757041	1761304	I worked on the greatest selling fucking video game of the past few years.
1761905	1770031	That and the fact that non-compete clauses in California actually I don't think are valid from what I've read.
1770951	1793623	so interesting well I'm not certainly I'm not a lawyer I can't even tell the difference between a plaintiff and a defendant but I mean there's a lot of development studios in like Canada and stuff I mean would that carry water if they I don't know but up north we'll find out what's gonna happen the plaintiff is the one doing the accusation I know that I was just I was ad-libbing earlier when you ad-lib you say stupid things sometimes so anyhow
1795069	1798313	But yes, the plaintiff is the one doing the suing and the defendant is the one.
1799494	1801737	Not that I've ever had to be a plaintiff or defendant, but I did.
1802077	1806642	I was on a jury once years ago and it definitely played out like an episode of Law & Order.
1806682	1808564	It was interesting.
1809185	1809906	Any plaintiff?
1810186	1811087	No, no, no, no, no.
1811307	1811968	Plaintiff.
1811988	1814211	That's what I was thinking of, Jay.
1815845	1816165	All right.
1816585	1823868	Look, moving on to other stories that have a little less to do with the shakeups and so forth, but a little more.
1823888	1827810	Well, actually, no, this is about a different type of shakeup and very much about television.
1828430	1835253	I'm sure a lot of you guys that listen to this program also kind of follow a lot of the other type of nerdy news, if you will, on the Internet.
1835273	1837274	And I'm sure a lot of you are big fans of Conan O'Brien.
1837814	1838275	DarkSakura.com
1863698	1878700	But the interesting part about this, I mean that part doesn't have anything to do with video games, but now that a deal has been signed, more news is coming out about some of the other deals that were presented to Conan, because of course when he left NBC it really seemed like
1879181	1879942	and DarkSakura.com
1898177	1911027	Team Conan was thinking actually of one idea way outside the network box there was actually discussions with Microsoft about an Xbox deal for Conan's show that would have broken new ground
1912188	1913088	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1931375	1948134	which by the way recently ended and I stopped watching it halfway through and had it spoiled for me on the internet who won but if you watched even the first episode of the show you could see who was going to win that show coming from a mile away but anyway that's not the point despite the fact whether the tester was a good or bad show whatever your opinion is on that
1948694	1975622	It did set this really interesting precedent And I said this a few weeks ago when I first reviewed the show Is that, okay, maybe the tester is a little bit of a wonky show But it's still fascinating that there is this budget There is money, there is drive There are embedded commercials And there's ways to make money off Direct to PlayStation Network types of TV shows And even though the tester might be weird It's really interesting to see what could maybe come next
1976983	1982069	Well, you now look at what you hear about what's going on over at with Microsoft and the deal they offered.
1982690	1996026	And you could kind of think maybe Microsoft was going to do some type of free show or ad supported show or who knows, maybe they would have sold certain types of the formats of the show or whatever of Conan O'Brien like every night.
1997762	2009489	What's also interesting, and when I was first telling a friend of mine about this, he said, is this maybe like 1 vs. 100 was on Xbox?
2010070	2015873	And I was thinking, well, that would be really interesting too, is that what if the whole show had actually played out live on Xbox Network?
2016494	2018395	And you could watch the show live.
2018695	2019636	I mean, if you think about it...
2020496	2025523	Microsoft has the bandwidth to make something like that happen, and they have the resources to do it.
2025563	2031170	I mean, isn't it really only a matter of time before you could get live television through your Xbox?
2031210	2032712	I mean, you get Netflix and everything.
2032852	2035295	A lot more people are playing games versus watching TV.
2038759	2046467	Even though the Conan O'Brien deal fell through or whatever and Conan decided to go with, I want to say traditional TV, but that's not really the case.
2046507	2050491	He went with basic cable, but still a more traditional type of format.
2050531	2055396	It's very interesting to see that, okay, well Microsoft's pursuing these types of ideas then.
2055816	2058679	So what might happen in the next year or so?
2059580	2060802	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2076380	2086705	And I'm not talking what it turned into years later, but old school Leo Laporte tech TV screensavers that was interactive with the Xbox audience.
2086765	2087986	Here's my problem with that.
2088346	2093409	And it goes for anything, even on the PlayStation Network or Wii or whatever.
2094149	2104674	Any of those shows are going to be obviously biased towards one console platform, and it just, to me, would seem like someone just shoving an advertisement in my face.
2105135	2108876	You know, basically, that's how I even look at the tester and stuff.
2109036	2112158	Oh, okay, it's a giant commercial for your fucking games.
2112478	2112898	Awesome.
2113399	2117801	You know, same with the, you know, screen savers type of show.
2117841	2120722	I didn't think, you know, and I gotta give the tester credit.
2120902	2122583	I mean, yeah, the show had flaws.
2122663	2123903	It had plenty of flaws.
2124024	2125484	But it wasn't terrible.
2125584	2131027	I think a lot of people judged that show without ever watching it for even five minutes.
2131487	2134588	And I'll tell you what, the production values on the show were not terrible.
2134669	2135449	Could it have been better?
2135909	2136229	Yes.
2136349	2138830	But was it like the worst thing to ever happen to PlayStation Network?
2138910	2139491	Not at all.
2140171	2141892	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2160379	2162501	But doesn't Microsoft kind of do the same thing?
2162901	2167225	Whenever they do their Major Nelson at PAX East, they're showing crackdown.
2167245	2168847	They're showing the Microsoft stuff.
2168867	2173451	They're not going to say, hey, we were at PAX East this week and, oh, APB is here.
2174111	2175353	You don't really see that.
2176073	2177274	on the Microsoft content.
2177894	2178414	You know what I mean?
2178474	2180615	You do expect there's going to be that certain type of synergy.
2180895	2184656	And I don't know, watching the tester, I didn't feel like the game stuff was shoved down my throat.
2184977	2195881	I kind of felt like, okay, I'm watching a show about video game testers or whatever, and you kind of expect there's going to be video games involved.
2195941	2200543	And I'm not suddenly going to see them playing the Nintendo Wii on a Sony PlayStation show.
2201363	2201664	Right?
2201904	2202245	Yeah.
2203026	2203307	So?
2204068	2205872	But that's my point though, I mean, it's just...
2207378	2207718	I don't know.
2207798	2218006	I mean, I guess if you want product stuff shoved into your face and you're going to subscribe to their online magazine, but it's just I don't really want to see that.
2218046	2225971	Now, if they actually brought the screensavers as the screensavers were to the network, then yeah, that would be fine.
2226512	2229014	But it's not going to be that way.
2229094	2233677	It's going to be kind of biased, and that's not something I'm really interested in.
2234582	2235303	I see what you're saying.
2235383	2238585	Because there would be an Xbox or a Microsoft-centric spin on it.
2238765	2242628	You're not going to see Max and things like that on the Xbox screens.
2242648	2247812	Because it wouldn't be like, yeah, I bought my 360 and it died four days later, you know.
2248832	2249553	You don't come to think of it.
2250654	2258002	Sorry to cut you off, but doesn't Microsoft kind of have, I mean, I think of, and I don't know if this is still around, but I'm thinking, okay, because we're sort of relatives.
2258142	2260905	We're like distant cousins of this, okay?
2261246	2263749	So All Games Network is the network we're on, right?
2264149	2267012	Who is run by Scott Rubin, right?
2267493	2271177	And Scott used to be on a TV show on G4 called G4 TV, right?
2271758	2273480	I'm playing like six degrees of Kevin Bacon here, right?
2273620	2273820	Yeah.
2273840	2280629	Okay, Scott hosted with Laura Foy was one, and the other girl was Tina.
2281290	2282972	I keep wanting to say Tina Fey, but it's not that.
2283053	2283153	It's
2284248	2286750	Oh gosh, I'm going to get yelled at by the chat room for not knowing this.
2286790	2289633	But these two gals hosted the show with Scott.
2290173	2296158	After the G4 TV thing folded that show, they went on to do some Microsoft-centric show.
2296559	2299161	Like 10-something it was called.
2299241	2306287	I know there's people that have listened to allgames.com for years that are going to jump in here and yell at what it is in our chat room at chatdowners.com.
2306587	2310551	But Microsoft is doing a show like that, or was at one time.
2310571	2311511	They did these little specials.
2312392	2327433	Thank you, Tina Wood They were doing these little specials for some time that weren't available on Xbox per se but it was on Microsoft's website and they were all about fun features of Microsoft and going out to the shows and so forth and showing what's going on
2328033	2345446	because another point I just wanted to say if there was a Conan centric show on Xbox or what have you I don't think it would be restricted to just Xbox I think there would be a way to get it on your Zune there would be a way to get it on your Windows mobile phone and there would be ways to get it on your desktop computer but the technology is certainly there
2347065	2347325	Yeah.
2348506	2348946	There you go.
2349226	2349746	On 10.
2349826	2350206	Thank you.
2350286	2356149	See, I knew I knew that there's a lot of people listen to us because of the all games connection and how we kind of joined up with that.
2356169	2360330	So I knew some of them have been following Scott and the old G4 family for years.
2360870	2369934	And yeah, Tiger Claw reminds us Diane Mizzota from the old G4 TV days is now on Scott's new show, the Appaday TV, which I watched the iPad special.
2370534	2371455	It was pretty good.
2372615	2397155	Every day though, that's going to be a lot of work App a day, one app a day An app a day keeps the Microsoft away, a doctor away, I don't know Alright, anyhow So I think it's very interesting, this whole Conan thing I mean, I can see why it didn't work out But it does kind of leave a very interesting door open to what might happen in the future So, we'll see
2398507	2400348	Anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news.
2400408	2401049	DarkSakura.
2401189	2402030	Why don't we?
2403451	2406373	We brought up Final Fight Double Impact earlier.
2406593	2409755	I'm sorry, Magic Sword Double Impact, Rob.
2411296	2412317	Well, the soundtrack is available.
2412437	2425527	You can download the remix soundtrack as done by Simon Vickland, the guy who also did the score for Bionic Commando Rearmed.
2427389	2431455	I will be, of course, linking that in the chat room.
2431996	2437324	But you can also find it at FinalFightGame.com slash remix.
2438325	2439968	So go get it.
2440468	2441390	Love Final Fight music.
2443850	2446212	I also think it's pretty cool that he's just putting it up there for free.
2447653	2454219	I like that these video game companies are putting up soundtracks for free, but they're not the only ones, right, DarkSakura?
2455420	2455940	Don't think so.
2456841	2457241	Let's see.
2458262	2461564	Yeah, also the God of War trilogy soundtrack is available.
2463766	2468410	And, of course, I think that's pretty cool that Sony's doing that for God of War 3.
2469191	2472133	Actually, I'm sorry, the whole trilogy, if I'm right.
2473493	2474514	God of War 3 God of War 3
2499892	2502533	I'm kind of surprised we don't see more game soundtracks out there.
2502573	2503714	I mean, not necessarily for free.
2503734	2504874	The Blood and Metal EP?
2505195	2508336	But, you know, I'm talking about even on iTunes.
2508456	2513939	And I should say, there's definitely been an increase of game soundtracks available on iTunes.
2514019	2518141	But, you know, these game soundtracks are really just promotion for the game at the end of the day.
2518341	2520002	So why not give them out for free?
2520222	2521443	Well, I linked it in the chat room, too.
2521723	2522103	There you go.
2522764	2523144	Good job.
2524685	2528267	Also, I just wanted to say real quick, we had a little bit of stream downtime.
2528287	2528547	I don't know.
2528567	2529828	We had a stream hiccup that happened.
2529848	2531209	We just kept right on rolling the tape.
2531529	2533470	But our live listeners are just now coming back on.
2533891	2536973	And there's some chat comments from before the hiccup.
2537013	2538253	And I wanted to get to some of these.
2539314	2543557	Blackwolf in our chat room, of course, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf, who tapes before us at All Games Radio.
2543997	2550439	He said, I wanted to point out that some of the on 10 stuff from E3 2007 actually showed people playing Wii games.
2550899	2551899	I was surprised.
2552599	2557260	Does that maybe play into the... And I don't want to... Maybe I shouldn't go back and open this whole can of worms.
2557600	2566423	But does that maybe play into the whole conspiracy theory from about three years ago before the Wii really took off on OMG Microsoft wants to buy Nintendo?
2567003	2567123	Like...
2568423	2585170	And also, didn't they say at one point that, maybe it was Nintendo that said this, I don't know, but somebody said that Microsoft is competing with Sony, not Nintendo Yeah So maybe, you know, showing a Wii game is okay, but showing a PS3 game not okay And I could see that
2586852	2587132	I don't know.
2587192	2588393	Anyway, sorry.
2589294	2590414	They're not saying that now.
2591915	2597379	Yeah, now that Natal's coming out, they probably won't be showing those wee clips anymore because now they are a little bit more of a competitor.
2597799	2598179	We'll see.
2598599	2602962	Anyway, for the live listeners, we'll play some of the songs from those soundtracks a little later on during our break.
2603282	2607305	For those of you listening on the podcast, you will have to go grab those at the URLs DarkSakura already gave you.
2608205	2609086	Yep, go get them.
2610051	2610351	All right.
2610591	2621677	Well, in case you're wondering, the teased Nintendo 3DS is going to be Nintendo's next platform, not necessarily just a revision of the current hardware.
2621697	2624018	It is actually going to be a brand new platform.
2624138	2626760	And that makes sense considering some of the stories we've talked about the 3DS.
2627700	2653315	or stuff that could possibly lend itself to the 3DS like for example the patent that was registered I believe last week for some sort of rumble device built into the new DS and of course the fact that the 3DS is going to be in 3D obviously it's going to be probably backwards compatible with the DSi stuff or the Nintendo DS stuff so yeah that makes sense
2654275	2654956	But that's kind of neat.
2655296	2657338	So, new platform, finally, for the handhelds.
2660360	2663103	So, in other words, it's not just a DS upgrade.
2663423	2663923	It's a brand new.
2663943	2665525	It is a new thing.
2666526	2678196	Basically, they're saying that we've run out of ideas for new games, so now we're going to put out a new Mario game and a new... I will say, though, my interest is piqued with this.
2678276	2680718	I am very curious to see how this plays out, because I am...
2681358	2682979	I'm not big on the 3D thing.
2683179	2685160	I think it's a little ridiculous for some of the movies.
2685280	2690203	I mean, yes, Avatar was pretty, but I mean, honestly, the 3D gave me a headache.
2690243	2692504	I think I would have enjoyed Avatar just as much in 2D.
2692644	2693205	That's what I'm saying.
2693565	2694205	I mean, was it pretty?
2694245	2696186	Yeah, but would I have enjoyed it just as much in 2D?
2696206	2696787	Of course I would have.
2698648	2702270	So I'm kind of curious if games are really going to make me feel differently about 3D.
2703663	2703963	and DarkSakura.
2719517	2722959	I'm not really interested in that stuff because those glasses are so damn expensive.
2723199	2732404	I think the best system out there that they should really go with, and I'm very surprised that they're just going with the actual shutter glasses and stuff, is that RealD 3D.
2732604	2734865	Because those glasses are fucking dirt cheap.
2735185	2742269	I mean, they hand them out for like five bucks when you go see a 3D movie, and it works just as well as those shutter glasses.
2742909	2748332	So, if they can come up with a TV that supports that, I think that'd be the way to go because, hell, I mean...
2750033	2774487	Don't have enough for your friends or something Just go buy a pack of 10 for like 20 bucks or something I don't know It's kind of funny, Sagan in our chatroom says Holodeck missed And if you're new to the show and you've never heard me kind of say Oh, we're one step closer to the Holodeck Every time we hear about this new invention in games Or the next generation of games Because the show's been on a little while now When our show started, the PlayStation 2 was still new, okay?
2775187	2789852	Whenever these new things are announced, it's always kind of like joking, well, we're one step closer to the holodeck, which from Star Trek The Next Generation was, you know, there is no, you basically were in the environment you wanted to be in or play your game or simulation in.
2790712	2804329	And I kind of think the one thing I could see that could be very cool about 3D is that, well, I don't even know if cool is the word I would use, but can you imagine, not so much on the DS, but on a big console, a big TV, a 3D version of Silent Hill?
2805070	2806752	I don't even know if I could play a game like that.
2806852	2808754	I think it just might be too much for me.
2808794	2810056	Like sensory overload, you know?
2810310	2812252	All I have to do is make this technology affordable.
2812852	2816355	Because if that system comes out at $200, that's not going to work.
2817176	2818817	A game like Myst could be doable.
2818857	2826683	I mean, the reason why I read that quote is because Myst, I don't know, there's a creepiness to Myst, but not, like, scary.
2827084	2828064	There's just a certain, like, I don't know.
2828084	2830266	I played Myst online for a couple weeks.
2830406	2831887	I'd want Holodeck Phantasmagoria.
2832248	2832448	Yeah.
2833028	2833568	You're sick.
2834248	2837829	But there's a certain creepiness to it without being, like, just downright scary.
2837849	2839570	Can you imagine 3D F-Zero?
2841390	2842290	I'd barf.
2842851	2845851	Like, 3D F-Zero would move very quickly.
2846351	2848172	F-Zero's a very fast-moving game.
2848212	2849212	I'd probably barf.
2849272	2850432	I think it might be too much.
2850472	2860115	Here's what I'm surprised, and we may see this later on, is, sorry, TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, people will just play WoW in realistic 3D.
2861311	2870238	is like arcade games with this kind of technology built in because it's just an LCD screen with some sort of extra screen in front of it that directs the light to your eyes.
2870838	2878503	That'd be perfect because especially sit-down racing games and stuff, you're obviously at a certain distance away from the screen that they could calibrate it to and there you go.
2879104	2888370	Yeah, but arcade games, I mean, I don't mean to jump ahead, but I know we have a story coming up later about arcades further on the decline and it's kind of like...
2889671	2890772	I don't know, that's a lot of money.
2912350	2941453	Alright, well I was talking about Sensory Overload and that kind of ties into the next story and it's about this study that was conducted by Australian researchers and what they're trying to do is kind of refute the claim that if you play violent video games before you go to bed you're going to have a hard time falling asleep so what they did is they did this study they took two groups of teenage boys sorry, no girls allowed apparently in this study and they made them play 50 minutes of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 I'm sorry, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare they split them into two groups
2942373	2959325	and one group played Call of Duty 4 the other group watched March of the Penguins while lying in bed and then after 50 minutes they had to go to sleep and what they found out the group that played Modern Warfare overall only took a few minutes longer to fall asleep than those that were watching the movie
2959892	2961493	That's because it's the March of the Penguins.
2961533	2963675	They would have fallen asleep from the movie.
2964256	2964876	Exactly.
2965057	2966057	It's boring.
2966298	2971542	Well, I think the reason why it might take longer to fall asleep is it has nothing to do with the violent content.
2971902	2978428	I think a more accurate thing would have been play Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare versus Super Mario Galaxy or something.
2978608	2979569	Well, maybe that's not the best.
2979709	2980930	Or Little Big Planet.
2980950	2982592	Something more G-rated in video games.
2982952	2983553	Because...
2984173	2991459	I think the reason why, you know, even though this whole study is supposed to show, oh, it doesn't keep you up as late, you know, whatever.
2991819	2996743	I think even the few minutes were probably because modern warfare is more interactive.
2997083	2998484	It's more mentally stimulating.
2998524	3002668	Yeah, it stimulates your mind more than watching a movie isn't quite as mentally stimulating.
3002688	3004569	Especially March of the Penguins.
3004689	3007892	I mean, my God, why would you torture someone like that?
3009403	3014166	I mean, like, I love penguins, but March of the Penguins, yeah, I was about to go to sleep during March of the Penguins.
3014206	3015106	I preferred Happy Feet.
3015186	3015667	Thank you very much.
3016527	3016967	Just so you know.
3017128	3020690	No, it's, I mean, I've been like, I want to go in the other group.
3023772	3024492	So there you go.
3024552	3029495	But this kind of begs the question, you know, kind of tying into the whole, and I'm asking this to the chat room as well.
3029535	3032257	So chatters, please voice your mind on this one.
3033297	3036299	Has there been a time where video games have ever impacted your sleep?
3038382	3039722	I've had dreams about games.
3041103	3041323	Yeah?
3041843	3045064	The same way you do about movies, you know, and shows and stuff.
3045944	3050606	I've had an interesting Silent Hill dream that I actually wanted to pitch as a game.
3050926	3051266	Oh, really?
3051986	3053667	Yeah, but it would be spoiling the ending.
3054027	3058869	Okay, well, let me not ask so much about the actual dream itself, but let me see your sleep habits.
3059289	3062730	Has video games ever impacted when you go to bed or how late you're staying up at night?
3063755	3064636	Not really.
3064816	3073682	I mean, I have a couple of times gotten caught up in a game, like just playing some Star Trek online, and then I'll realize that I've fallen asleep in a battle or something, and then I'll just turn it off.
3073882	3074102	Nice.
3075243	3076444	I've done that once, by the way.
3078562	3092950	but I not really, I mean I'd stay up all night playing Blue Dragon but my plan first was to stay up all night and I played Blue Dragon to keep myself staying up all night I remember when I was younger I literally stayed up till like 6am in the morning playing Super Mario Bros.
3093150	3106697	2 when I first played it I did that though with Final Fantasy 3 over here, Final Fantasy 6 so I did that, I did it for a week and then World of Warcraft, you know there's that raid that keeps you up later than you intended
3108247	3110119	I mean, I'll admit it, it's happened.
3110523	3111943	Video games have impacted my sleep.
3111983	3112664	How about you, Loki?
3113044	3114164	Final Fantasy XI.
3114224	3116804	I used to play with the Japanese folks.
3116945	3120625	In order to play with the Japanese guys, you have to stay up until 5 in the morning.
3121406	3122166	I've done that before.
3122726	3124186	I did it on purpose.
3124906	3126907	No, but see, that's the thing, though.
3127327	3128547	That was a conscious choice.
3128587	3130728	It wasn't like, oh, games making me stay up.
3131708	3136669	And I have to say, though, after I'm done gaming, I fell asleep like a rock.
3136949	3140050	I mean, it did not keep me up at all.
3140742	3141503	I have no problem going to sleep.
3163288	3166949	Really, when you get down to the bottom of the study, what is it that they're trying to figure out?
3166969	3169690	They're trying to figure out whether they can blame games for something else.
3170210	3171890	I mean, that's really what it comes down to.
3172030	3175451	It's like, oh my god, violent video games are bad because they prevent you from sleeping.
3176371	3177232	I mean, really?
3177252	3180572	Because you just lie there in bed thinking about all the blood you just splattered.
3181013	3186114	You're not going to play the violent video game and go to bed and go, oh my god, someone's going to kill me now.
3186574	3210070	Unless you're like mentally disturbed and in which case you shouldn't be playing games in the first place at least that way and I mean if games are affecting you in that way don't play them right before bed I mean come on take some damn responsibility for yourself don't we don't need to be funding the I mean who did this obviously it's somebody funded by somebody else so that's money wasted right there if you ask me.
3210512	3213314	Let's go to our chat room with some comments and answers to the question.
3214354	3218416	Have you ever stayed up all night and had your sleep plans impacted by a video game?
3218996	3224579	Shaoran says, if by impacted your sleep you mean play Final Fantasy X all night, in that case, yeah.
3224599	3228582	Dartetsuya says, does staying up till all hours of the night playing Beat Media 2DX count?
3229242	3231663	Bochikawa says, it has, but I've got sleep issues.
3232023	3234805	I sleep for too long and use entertainment to try to regulate hours.
3235966	3238368	Ranma says Sky that was me with Super Mario Bros.
3238608	3264009	3 and now I'm doing it with Final Fantasy 13 you know what I kind of find is that I just have a hard problem falling asleep before midnight period and I don't know if games are to really blame for that but I just like I don't go to bed before midnight ever even if I have to be up at 5 in the morning or no matter what time I have to be up I can't like force myself to go to bed before midnight just force feed yourself shows that you don't want to watch like for example reruns on the Food Network it'll put you to sleep without you even knowing it
3264489	3266291	I can't let myself do that.
3266391	3266791	I don't know why.
3266851	3268112	I can't let myself do that either.
3268132	3269614	I can take a towel at all PM if I really want to.
3269654	3282045	But then my wife is leaning on one side, my cat's on my lap, so it's like I'm stuck there with my eyes glued open trying to watch the same episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.
3282065	3284107	And it's like, I've already seen this eight times.
3284547	3285548	I don't want to see it again.
3287503	3288023	All right.
3288484	3294848	No, but seriously, though, everybody is basically saying that they made conscious choices to stay up because the game they want to play, you know, was fun.
3295148	3301393	Not necessarily that they stopped playing and they couldn't fall asleep because they were playing a violent video game or a video game in general.
3301493	3304655	So once again, do we really need this study?
3306366	3310971	On the same token, I have stayed up late reading a book because I wanted to finish the book.
3311592	3312993	I wanted to get to the next chapter.
3313654	3318299	I've stayed up watching entire TV series because I wanted to see the next episode.
3318339	3319880	I wanted to see what happened next.
3320962	3322123	So it's the same thing.
3322620	3348796	I was up very late last night watching Mean Girls so I'm not lying I really was up till like 1.30 because we were watching Mean Girls I've read books and then fell asleep and started dreaming parts of the book like later on and then had to turn in a book report and it didn't come out that well because what I dreamt didn't actually happen in the book but it was funny because I didn't know that because I thought I had just been reading the book
3352126	3353948	There is an Iraqi video game coming out
3375859	3376780	Developed in Iraq.
3377240	3378961	Took 17 years to develop.
3379661	3388847	They started developing it under Hussein's reign because it was really hard to get in the items that they needed.
3390268	3391828	Good God, 17 years?
3391909	3393389	Is it on the ColecoVision?
3393409	3393389	1993.
3394670	3399613	Rabah Shihab was an engineering student at the University of Baghdad.
3400694	3404336	And after the Gulf War, he wanted to make a video game.
3404896	3410821	So he started... It was... There had been none made in Iraq.
3410881	3415365	So he basically decided to try to make a fun game.
3416266	3423092	And he wanted to... He wanted to counter the bad images of the Gulf War.
3423552	3427155	You know, the bombs and everything by showing something that's a little bit more culturally deep.
3428096	3432059	And so, according to this, he saved up to buy an Amiga.
3433908	3434088	And, um...
3450438	3452339	Doesn't he know not to copy that floppy?
3454681	3456422	Well, at any rate, they finish the game.
3457303	3465088	And it's about two brothers named Nasir and Blasir who went throughout ancient Mesopotamia to fight an evil sorcerer.
3465828	3471032	And so now the game Babylonian Twins is being published for iPhone.
3471892	3472853	And iPod Touch.
3473113	3473774	Sorry, iPad.
3474174	3476215	For iPad and iPhone and I guess iPod Touch.
3477596	3479017	But actually I watched some of the...
3481179	3484782	The movie of it, the little film of it is actually pretty cool.
3485303	3493291	So they basically redid the graphics all high def and added new music, new levels and it's actually already on the iPhone.
3493892	3495693	So you can go get it.
3495914	3497735	And it reached the top 20 in the first week.
3498416	3499697	That's kind of neat.
3499777	3503759	I really like his inspiration because I think the guy's got a really good point.
3503899	3509522	I think there's a lot of people over here, because a lot of us have practically grown up on the Gulf War.
3509542	3517887	I mean, I know that's a weird way of saying it, but especially the demographic that listens to this program in their 20s and stuff have known of the Gulf War since they were kids.
3518207	3522510	So I think the images we get of Iraq, unfortunately, are bombs.
3522970	3524013	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
3532469	3535411	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3561844	3567126	and he hopes that in America it can serve as a small indication of what Iraq is beyond a deadly quagmire.
3568246	3570107	By the way, of all places, I got this at AOL News.
3570987	3572988	Hey, nothing wrong with that.
3573928	3578350	I'm going to link this in the chat room and I'd love for people to watch the little trailer that came with it.
3578850	3580570	It looks super fun, actually.
3580650	3582211	It looks kind of Mario-esque.
3582691	3584072	I'm actually going to download it.
3584212	3587393	I'm on iTunes right now and I'll hopefully do a review next week.
3587953	3588233	Very cool.
3590361	3599523	Props to that guy for 17 years is an awfully long time and that's a lot of drive and something you really believe in.
3599563	3605164	If you think about it, we've only been doing this show, which has definitely been a labor of love, for what, 8 years?
3605344	3607665	That's not even half the time it took this guy to make this game.
3608885	3609705	Just food for thought.
3611645	3614006	To be fair, he didn't spend all that time making the game.
3614718	3622386	3 bucks on the iPhone and 5 bucks on the iPad The HD version on the iPad So you know what, you can spend 3 bucks and give it a try
3631966	3632246	All right.
3632886	3633487	Go look at the trailer.
3633507	3634227	See if it's up your alley.
3634287	3642451	One other thing is that because he actually put a lot of expense into it because all the stuff was really expensive to get, especially in the times that he was in.
3642531	3648153	So he was actually quoted saying that he doesn't expect to really make back the money he spent on it, but it would be nice.
3649134	3650854	So help a guy out.
3650894	3652175	Spend the three bucks.
3652535	3654456	Let him know that it wasn't in vain.
3656343	3664530	Alright, well best of luck to the guy in selling the application and getting the word out there that Iraq is much more than a war.
3665291	3668854	I think that's a very good kind of moral, I guess, to the story.
3669335	3673739	Alright, let's talk about some other games coming out around the world in some other parts.
3673899	3674819	We'll start here in the U.S.
3674920	3675400	with Loki.
3675460	3676221	What's coming out in the U.S.
3676241	3676501	this week?
3677147	3679948	Not a lot, but there's some decent stuff.
3680068	3682049	Start off with Blood Bowl on PSP.
3682469	3683869	It's delayed from a few weeks ago.
3684009	3686830	Finally, hopefully coming out on PSP this week.
3687911	3697213	The Classic Controller Pro in both white and black coming out to tie in with Monster Hunter Tri, which will be making its way out on the Wii.
3697434	3701915	Also, All-Star Karate coming to the Wii as well.
3702355	3704896	I guess that's a little bit better than All-Star Cheerleader.
3705596	3711862	and then finally Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper coming out on Xbox 360.
3712662	3723572	Also on the PlayStation Network and Xbox 360 Marketplace this week After Burner Climax will be the game of the week.
3725467	3754814	I bet DarkSakura is going to check that out Yep Damn straight Alright, let's go over to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates A little bit busier this week than it has been in recent weeks in Japan Coming out on the Xbox 360 Ketsui Kizuna Jigoku Tachi Extra In regular and limited editions on the 360 This is a shooter classic from Cave that's getting upgraded for the 360 Includes networking abilities where you can play with other people in a shooter
3755094	3756916	Cave did Eskbaluka.
3757176	3757617	That's right.
3757757	3761360	So you shooter fans, you shmup fans have something to look forward to this week.
3761821	3763583	And I imagine some folks will be importing that.
3764283	3768448	Also on the 360 this week from Square Enix, Nier Gestalt.
3768688	3771691	And this is one of the ones they've been teasing for a little while, right, Nier?
3772792	3777237	Is this one of the ones that's on the Unreal Engine as well?
3779037	3779677	Maybe?
3779697	3780438	I don't remember.
3780638	3786399	But it is a big new action-adventure RPG series that is coming out over here, what, by the end of the year?
3787179	3789419	Actually, it's coming out the week after next.
3789659	3789960	Oh, wow.
3789980	3790660	So, good.
3790740	3792340	We won't have to wait very long to get it over here.
3792720	3795741	But if you want to get it a couple weeks early, the Japanese release is out soon.
3796141	3800882	Also, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion is getting its Game of the Year edition finally out in Japan.
3800922	3805323	Remember, it took them a little while to get Oblivion over there because they have a translated version, right?
3805803	3806443	And there's a lot.
3807143	3809004	of Dialogue and so forth and Oblivion.
3809064	3812144	I mean, God, talk about a game with depth.
3812544	3816065	So they're just now getting around to their Game of the Year edition like we've had over here in the U.S.
3816105	3816446	for a while.
3817166	3819226	Same style on the PlayStation 3.
3820006	3824508	PlayStation 3 is also getting its own version of Nier, but they call it Nier Replicant on the PS3.
3824828	3828689	It's almost like a different game on the 360 and the PS3.
3829369	3830429	I'm not sure how that all works.
3830489	3833130	Is that like a Pokemon Red and Blue thing, but it's on different systems?
3833510	3834010	I have no idea.
3834030	3835151	That's very interesting.
3835211	3836111	It could be a side story.
3836951	3837311	It could be.
3837371	3838292	Sometimes that happens.
3838652	3840012	That's very interesting.
3840032	3841993	You don't really usually see that in the same week, though.
3842493	3843653	I'm curious to see how that plays out.
3844194	3849896	The Nintendo Wii does not have any huge games this week, but they have one called Ivy the Kiwi that sounds cute.
3849976	3850416	Ivy the Kiwi.
3850876	3852516	This looks a lot like...
3854597	3857519	Oh, some game I've seen on the... No, I guess it's not that same game.
3857659	3858560	Oh, it looks cute though.
3858600	3860181	I really like the art style in this game.
3860722	3861502	Looks very cool.
3861923	3864404	Imagine like a very hand-drawn kind of game.
3865025	3866306	That's coming out on the Wii this week.
3866546	3867407	I like that art style.
3867867	3869108	Google that and look at some pictures from that.
3869128	3871390	That's Ivy the Kiwi as a question.
3871750	3872250	Ivy the Kiwi?
3873631	3882615	Playstation 2 gets another pachinko game out this week this one Higurashi no Naku Koromu ni Matsuri but just what you really needed another pachinko game how about the Nintendo DS?
3882655	3902562	Nintendo DS gets its own version of Ivy the Kiwi but the big release would be Naruto Naruto Shippuden Ninjutsu Senkai Cha Crash comes out on the Nintendo DS this week yes it's another Naruto game it's a brand new battle system though you fill your chakra gauge as you fight Sasuke Itachi or Dadara
3904417	3927208	whatever uh if you're a fan of Naruto I'm sure you already have that on import and uh on the PSP actually some big big releases on the PSP this week Knights in the Nightmare comes out and I think a game that a lot of folks are going to be into on the PSP Disgaea Infinite comes out that's right Disgaea on the PSP with infinite possibilities let's go over to the UK
3929364	3929965	DarkSakura
3947326	3950509	And that actually makes me sad because of one of my co-workers.
3951770	3955012	Except for the middle initial, those are his last name and first initial.
3955112	3956433	So it actually made me think about him.
3956633	3956993	Interesting.
3957414	3959215	I hope it doesn't have anything to do with him.
3960276	3963338	And Vigilant Chronicles, an MMO.
3964619	3965980	21st Afterburner Climax, woohoo!
3967501	3973846	And the 23rd Dead to Rights Retribution, Monster Hunter Tri, Nier.
3975194	3976295	and The Whispered World.
3976976	3978457	That's a cool name, The Whispered World.
3979818	3980158	That's it.
3980278	3980999	That is a nice name.
3982040	3983581	The Whispered World.
3983901	3984402	Whisper.
3984782	3986063	Makes me think of Wispy Woods.
3987464	3988165	That was the stage.
3988325	3990667	Anyone know where Wispy Woods comes from?
3991247	3992168	Kirby's Avalanche.
3992208	3993669	Good job, you get a gold star.
3994070	3994790	I have that game.
3994810	3997473	When you go to the level, it goes, Wispy Woods.
3997533	3999814	You are a classic game sponge.
3999875	4000235	I love it.
4001314	4004096	Kirby's Avalanche was like my game until I discovered it was Puyo Puyo.
4004116	4005817	I was like, Puyo Puyo!
4006417	4011001	Kirby's Avalanche was my game and I never discovered it was Puyo Puyo until, seriously, this show.
4011321	4014883	And interacting with you and your sponge of import game knowledge.
4014903	4016244	You know what else was Puyo Puyo, right?
4016825	4017525	The Dr. Robotnik.
4017545	4018986	Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
4019106	4019346	Oh yeah.
4019686	4028833	And I think a lot of people always wondered back in the day, like, how come the same damn game is out on the Genesis and the Nintendo but they use the different franchises?
4028853	4030394	Like, that was kind of weird to see back then.
4031234	4031475	Anyhow.
4046172	4046892	Talk about random.
4047093	4048433	Hi Loki, what's on deck next?
4066845	4076499	is trying to create a game to educate the public about the difficulty of reducing the US budget deficit.
4077620	4081966	So basically, they're trying to create a game
4083388	4086770	to show you that balancing the budget is hard!
4087691	4102860	And the joke, of course, goes that anybody who is able to balance the budget will immediately be whisked away to some secret government location a la Last Starfighter to balance the real budget.
4102960	4103800	It's budget mama.
4104521	4105521	Don't worry, mama will fix it.
4105561	4109624	I'm sorry, but why spend money to say that...
4110305	4111846	My dub is hard.
4112087	4113348	I can't do this.
4113708	4116031	I mean, it just sounds like whining to me.
4116451	4117633	Budget Mama for President 2012.
4117753	4120936	And the other way you can look at it is like, well, we don't know how to do it.
4120996	4122478	Do you guys have any ideas?
4122598	4123940	I mean, really?
4124560	4126723	I thought, and granted, I didn't read the story.
4127023	4130924	I just thought from looking at the title we're putting together tonight's thing.
4131844	4135465	I don't like to spoil myself because I like to kind of have topics unfold on air here.
4135905	4142587	But I kind of thought when they talked about a game about balancing the budget, I kind of thought it would be like personal budget.
4142927	4150048	Like teach kids at a young age how to not spend more than they make and maybe how to save a little bit and so forth.
4150509	4151949	That would seem like the game to make.
4153944	4166248	Like an Oregon trail, but you don't spend too much on the wagon wheels because then you won't have enough for food unless you take a lot of guns with you because then you can shoot buffalo and have 999 pounds of food.
4166388	4169829	And in case you didn't think that the Obama campaign is...
4170169	4170910	Out of it enough.
4172591	4181639	They thought that what you could get is support among the populace for an exceptionally unpopular thing that you need to solve this problem.
4182519	4185101	And also saying that the game could go viral.
4185742	4186022	Wow.
4186242	4189325	Way to use buzzwords that you have no idea what the meaning are.
4189345	4192828	Like Super Chick Sisters and the other PETA games and how viral they went.
4192848	4193749	It could go viral.
4194309	4196730	I'm sorry, it has to be good for it to go viral.
4196850	4199072	Well, actually, it has to be popular for it to go viral.
4199092	4205615	No, I mean, Joystick, Kotaku, and all those kids will report on it, and people will play it for like a day, and then they'll be like, LOL, and then never play it again.
4206035	4207116	That's what happens with a lot of these.
4207156	4208276	Like the PETA games.
4208597	4209657	Same thing, right?
4210037	4213459	People look at them, play them once, go LOL, and then that's it.
4214220	4219182	Honestly, I actually think that you touched on something earlier that might actually be legitimate.
4220103	4220463	Matt did.
4220948	4224151	There's also an A-plus genius comment in chat I want to get to in just a minute.
4224311	4224571	Okay.
4224912	4234079	I really do think that perhaps the whole point behind this is to trick people into actually playing it to get new ideas.
4234700	4239444	Because seriously, it's like I put it in the same category, and I'm being serious, as America's Army.
4240871	4241812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
4257042	4257782	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4277423	4294973	And maybe I'm taking your comment in the wrong context and running another way in it, but could it be then that you're saying maybe this, I mean, I don't think this is what you're saying, but kind of of that comment, maybe this is a way to tell kids balancing the budget is hard and think about how you spend your own money because balancing the government budget is next to impossible.
4295354	4296454	No, that's not what it is.
4296975	4300377	Well, I know that's not what it is, but I think it makes sense in that light.
4300517	4305660	But seriously, I think what it is is a way to tap an untrained...
4306500	4307281	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4328360	4337067	I mean, keep in mind the benefit of getting, I would have to say, an unfiltered perspective.
4338874	4340536	Getting fresh eyes to look at something.
4340596	4344379	I mean, that is legitimately a unique way of doing it.
4344439	4358472	I mean, it's one thing to just go out and pull a bunch of people who you know to be talented in it, but another thing to put it out under the pretenses of a game and let people work on it without having a real attachment to it and see what creative solution they come up with.
4359542	4362864	A better sim would be for them... It's so crazy, Jamie, it might be true.
4363464	4364205	That's my thought.
4366426	4373950	And again, keep in mind, I'm coming from the point of view where... In the design point of view, let's put it this way.
4374230	4377812	You've got all these people who are trained to do... Oh, we use Helvetica for this.
4378193	4379073	We do Swiss design.
4379113	4379453	We do this.
4379493	4379894	We do that.
4380254	4382175	The FedEx logo was created by an intern.
4384349	4401143	just some new kid who came in so think about that you get that fresh perspective you get someone who's not bogged down by just the weight of the industry in this case by the weight of politics where could they go?
4401764	4409008	Ironically enough, I don't like talking about my day job a lot on this show, but I did mention I just started a new day job this past week, actually.
4409448	4413551	And I think part of what they're looking for me to bring to this position is a fresh perspective.
4413731	4416793	That's a big part of why I'm doing the job I'm doing.
4417213	4419094	So it's interesting that you kind of tie that together.
4419174	4422596	Well, if they want a fresh perspective, vote these people out of office.
4422896	4426378	These people were not voted into their job.
4426438	4427379	They were elected.
4427399	4427499	Right.
4427819	4430720	Well, we can take care of the people that put them there.
4430740	4432181	I think you're completely missing the point.
4432341	4433782	I really think you're completely missing the point.
4433802	4439785	But I worry that the people that would jump up and say, I'll do the job instead, are not the ones that should be doing it either.
4440405	4440845	You know what I mean?
4440865	4450810	See, I'm looking at this as a consultant, someone who will provide the fresh perspective, someone who will give the ideas, and then let the people who are trained, who see the big picture...
4451670	4452331	Actually run with it.
4452732	4453954	I think it's brilliant, honestly.
4454034	4455536	I really do think it's very intelligent.
4457639	4462366	Especially if our president supports the idea, then I'm very glad I voted for him.
4462867	4465789	Well, just so you guys know, it isn't the first time that they've tried this.
4465829	4472813	Apparently in 1989, the National Economic Commission distributed hard choices on floppies for $20 a copy.
4474354	4481378	And apparently also the 1994 commission also released a game with the title Budget Shadows.
4483696	4485177	and Budget Shadows.
4485357	4492220	And unfortunately, even though those games were released, we still don't have a balanced budget.
4492560	4497983	Okay, how many of you guys, total random tangent, but quick poll in studio, how many of you guys watch Channel 6, KVIE?
4498023	4499464	How many of you guys watch Channel 6?
4500444	4502165	What if it's not Channel 6?
4502365	4504066	I know, this is a Sacramento reference, but whatever.
4504086	4505707	KVIE, the PBS, how many of you guys ever watch that?
4509088	4509428	I have.
4509568	4510008	I have too.
4510088	4512309	They show some neat things once in a while on PBS, actually.
4512669	4513829	Besides just Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers.
4513849	4515069	We were bored one night.
4515469	4516270	Extremely bored.
4516470	4517330	And high.
4517490	4518370	No, not high.
4518650	4520290	We were so bored.
4520630	4523531	And the only thing it was on was a Michael Bolton concert.
4523871	4529452	And it was like, I don't want to watch this, but seriously, it is the only thing on TV right now.
4529752	4533153	Hey, well, actually, we had a story a couple weeks ago about how Video Games Live was doing a thing for PBS.
4533968	4549453	That would have been way better than the Michael Bolton concert I saw a Lorena McKinnon concert that was filmed for PBS that was amazing Although I have to say props to them for being one of the first to have HD PBS introduced me to Doctor Who when I was a child
4549693	4559477	Well, the reason why I bring that up, and I'm not just saying this comment is great because it's from a friend of mine, but Saganar Chatroom says, this is why I need to start the Corporation for Public Gaming.
4560117	4564179	I always found that there was a need for journalistic game development in the vein of the persuasive games.
4564539	4571002	So while I like the idea of having a budget-balanced game, but this isn't quite the most productive path to make an effective title.
4571262	4578805	And there's a part of me that goes, why isn't there a foundation for public gaming, a corporation like there is for PBS?
4579486	4584527	This Jazz Jackrabbit was brought to you by... Well, why not?
4585047	4585367	I agree.
4586988	4587528	Isn't it weird?
4587568	4589588	I think there's Flash games that are like that, aren't there?
4590768	4591689	It's different.
4592689	4598830	And maybe television is different than Xbox and Wii and all this, but certainly maybe PC games.
4599650	4602131	It is a little interesting that we don't have more of a...
4604150	4608434	I guess publicly funded game development thing, although I guess maybe that's part of what Loki's talking about.
4609515	4609855	I don't know.
4610015	4610896	This is very interesting.
4611276	4614719	I just kind of read that comment and I went, huh, that's a really good point.
4615000	4616921	How come they have it for TV if they don't have it for games?
4619444	4619744	Interesting.
4620979	4624061	Anyhow, we got a couple more stories here and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
4625161	4627662	I want to talk about Xbox Live and crime.
4629723	4630184	Here's the deal.
4630764	4633345	What happened is that there was a Connecticut man, just 23 years old.
4633385	4634146	He was out on bail.
4634306	4638588	I guess he had been arrested for gun charges, drug charges, you know, all that type of shady stuff.
4639068	4642070	Apparently, he got re-arrested even though he was out on bail.
4642170	4642510	Why?
4643110	4647532	He sent threatening messages to witnesses on Xbox Live.
4647993	4650494	This all according to the New Haven Connecticut Register.
4651614	4661058	Anthony Hayward is his name and he sent an Xbox Live message to one of the witnesses that says rats die slow and it included the witness's home address.
4661078	4663298	This was back in December but you know things take time.
4663318	4664939	Can we give him a stupid award?
4664999	4665379	We could.
4665479	4670421	You know what's funny though is that could just be regular Xbox Live dialogue if you ask me.
4670521	4672401	I mean he might not have actually been here.
4672421	4674282	I was just playing Call of Duty officer.
4674342	4675002	Seriously.
4677183	4679304	This is DarkSakura talking about the stupid award.
4680223	4683225	By the way, just so you know, he had been arrested last summer.
4683906	4687088	There was a stolen gun under the passenger seat of the car he was driving.
4688129	4690230	Apparently, the witness said he placed it there.
4690530	4692251	He surrendered himself to police.
4692792	4697915	He was charged with witness tampering, intimidating a witness, and two counts of second-degree harassment.
4698656	4699777	The judge set the bail for $50,000.
4699817	4700017	Idiot.
4710164	4714387	I gotta say though, Xbox Live, you know, you don't, it's just another medium now.
4714427	4716308	It's just as easy as writing an email or whatever.
4716788	4720631	Alright, DarkSakura's got one more story for us and then the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
4721181	4729370	Oh yeah, so you remember me telling you a long time ago about playing Descent and having to have it on 14 discs back in the day?
4730010	4731652	Yes, the little three and a half inch floppy.
4731672	4733314	You had to install like 14 discs.
4733614	4734555	Please insert disc two.
4734595	4735416	Please insert disc three.
4735456	4742743	And my friend, who I actually reconnected with on Facebook recently, my friend Avery, he modified a chair for Descent.
4743885	4744826	I thought it was pretty cool.
4745266	4746508	It was uber.
4747469	4747730	Awesome.
4747770	4749472	Like did the chair move as Descent?
4749772	4753457	No, but he had like joysticks rigged and keypads and stuff.
4753578	4753818	Okay.
4754539	4755340	I wonder if he still has it.
4755500	4759626	Anyway, so Interplay is actually going to be bringing Descent to WiiWare.
4761025	4786804	And, um, it's being developed by G1M2 And, um, we'll be using the Wiimote, um, to, uh, move in the game That's gonna be interesting I, I, I gotta tell ya If you have a hard time conceptualizing 3D in your mind Like, I know a lot of us did when we had to move from 2D to 3D gaming Like, part of the reason I struggle with Metroid Is I can't, like, just conceptualizing it all in 3D is kinda hard sometimes Like, Descent will seriously, like...
4787745	4789346	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4815185	4817427	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4838202	4840043	These people, and I'll try to find the article again.
4840163	4849305	These people made a wall facade and put up windows in it with actually two plasma monitors and a Mac.
4850505	4856506	And they did the Wiimote hack and then had this sensor board that you could wear around your neck.
4857126	4860987	And it would head track the windows so you could go to the windows and peer through them and go around.
4862568	4864188	Oh, sorry, the poltergeists are attacking my room again.
4865070	4872251	but you could peer in the windows and everything I really really think that that should be where those kind of games go
4874789	4875750	Will you check this out?
4875790	4877572	I'd throw up, but I think it'd be funny.
4877892	4879533	Will you check this out on WiiWare when it comes out?
4879974	4880454	Probably.
4881155	4882876	Did they name a price?
4883797	4886439	Or a little early for that?
4886479	4887740	I think it's too early for that.
4889121	4895166	What I would really like to see though with that is I hope it's not pixel like it was.
4895306	4899670	I would really like for them to at least just clean up the pixels in it.
4899830	4901531	Or render it.
4901611	4902272	Shit, I mean...
4904296	4909258	Before we get into the next segment here, I just want to quickly ask DarkSakura a question from a chatter here.
4909838	4913659	Fun ET Man in chat says, Good night, but a quick question for DarkSakura.
4914099	4917880	Which Puyo Puyo is the best for being the most easily obtainable?
4919361	4920501	An actual Puyo Puyo?
4920521	4924002	Probably DS, Puyo Puyo DS, probably.
4924142	4925343	For the US, yeah.
4925583	4930224	I would say you can get Puyo Pop, whatever that one was.
4930264	4931845	Isn't there a Puyo Party or something?
4932518	4935560	There was this game called Puyo Puyo DS that came out when the DS first came out.
4935640	4937221	It's probably really easy to get and cheap now.
4937561	4938082	Probably.
4939403	4941064	But Puyo Pop, you can just get that anywhere.
4941464	4944206	And it came out on DS.
4944706	4948649	And I've actually got a Puyo Puyo that came out on Neo Geo Pocket Color a while back.
4949269	4952651	If you're looking for an import, though, I don't know.
4952931	4960636	I have the PC Engine Duo version, which my friend picked up for 900 yen in Japan.
4962287	4966748	I'm not supposed to tell you this, but just go get a Super Nintendo emulator and download Kirby's Avalanche.
4968888	4970209	Kirby's Avalanche!
4970229	4972069	It's also supported in MAME, too, by the way.
4972309	4972649	Oh, is it?
4972929	4973729	It's good to know.
4975050	4976250	There's all kinds of versions.
4976270	4977730	Nintendo 64 had a version.
4978190	4983932	Saturn had, I think, Puyo Puyo Sun, which is actually one I'm still looking for.
4984152	4985152	That's a game I'm actually looking for.
4985192	4985832	It's Puyo Puyo Sun.
4986886	4990108	Actually, and to be fair, maybe I shouldn't endorse the whole emulator thing.
4990468	4994911	I believe Robotnik's Mean Beaten Machine is all over those Sega collections.
4995051	4996852	It's tucked away on a lot of the Sonic ones.
4998373	5004896	In fact, I'm positive it's on the Sonic's Genesis Collection game that came out last year.
5005817	5008178	And that's a great deal because that game was only like, what, $20?
5008898	5013261	And it's like 30, 40 Genesis games and some arcade games.
5013781	5014942	and Mean Bean Machines.
5014982	5017144	They're cheap now.
5017264	5019006	Seriously, that's an awesome buy.
5019246	5019687	It really is.
5019747	5020407	It's super fun.
5020467	5027354	Especially for you younger guys and gals who didn't kind of grow up experiencing Genesis like we did.
5027887	5033729	And there's also some actually pretty fun achievements in it, but you unlock your games too by getting certain scores on some of the crappier games.
5033769	5034789	Yeah, good times.
5035089	5035269	Yeah.
5036030	5036310	Good times.
5036710	5040191	Anyway, see how much this woman knows about her classic gaming?
5040471	5043612	That's why she gets a segment every week on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.
5043632	5049814	Oh, by the way, Puyo Puyo 64 was a four-player Puyo Puyo, so you can tell me what that was.
5050094	5050595	See what I mean?
5051135	5051756	She knows her shit.
5052116	5059062	So every week on this show, DarkSakura dives into the vault and picks out a classic game that she thinks you all should be playing this week.
5059803	5060363	Right now.
5060743	5063166	She wants to edumacate you on a classic game.
5063226	5064727	It's called DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.
5065007	5067429	DarkSakura, what could the Classic Game of the Week possibly be?
5067950	5069111	It's Descent!
5070252	5071713	What a crazy coincidence.
5072093	5074315	What made you decide to pick it this week?
5075256	5076037	Because I felt like it.
5076177	5077258	It was either that or Microcosm.
5078055	5078555	Maybe next week.
5079536	5081678	It's certainly worthy of being the game of the week.
5081998	5086461	It ties into the news, certainly, but I think there's a lot of people that miss this game.
5087722	5089063	So tell us about Descent, DarkSakura.
5089403	5096549	So you go throughout the solar system from the moon to Pluto's moon, Charon, and you beat a boss robot, but then you can't go home.
5097348	5104032	All these infected robots, you have to shoot them and then stop the main robot.
5104692	5107194	This is actually one of the games that made me really motion sick.
5108815	5113318	It used a wireframe map.
5114518	5124824	But, um, it was only, like, around your absolute position, so you, you know, as you'd move through it, it was... It's really hard to describe.
5124924	5132508	And also, the thing that actually made me really emotional about this one is that you seem to always be tilting.
5133569	5135490	I mean, I'm not the only one who saw that, right?
5137331	5140453	So, anyway... I would play it spinning all the time.
5140673	5143995	I was in a constant barrel roll.
5144095	5152580	I had a hard-ass time controlling it.
5153620	5157622	It was actually one of the harder games, too.
5157782	5158023	It was...
5160313	5162014	It was a full 3D environment.
5162074	5171398	You had to increase your speed while using acceleration controls and directional controls and different stuff.
5171878	5175539	You had to pretty much multitask the entire time you were playing.
5176360	5177440	So that was pretty difficult.
5177820	5180781	It did have an 8-player LAN mode.
5181942	5186164	Actually, I think there's even still Descent servers up today.
5186684	5187304	Descent 2 was...
5191152	5193114	Actually, it's supposed to be pretty much okay online, too.
5194235	5199981	There were 27 levels and three secret levels in the first Descent.
5200061	5213114	You had, like, some of them were the moon, Venus, Mercury, parts of Mars, moons on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, blah, blah, blah.
5213714	5213795	Um...
5215736	5244029	so you would just show up in your different location when you started and you would have your shield energy which was like your life but you could only restore your shield through power ups and it would only go up to 200% and if you finish the mission below 100% your shield is charged to 100% but if you were above 100% then it would stay where it was like if you were at 120 it would be at 120 when you start um
5245563	5274780	and you did have limited lives unlimited in multiplayer and when you respawn you start from the beginning the beginning of the level so it's pretty kind of crazy it was originally DOS for 386 PCs at 33 megahertz you play it on something you know now of course it's gonna play like a dream you know if you can of course find the stuff you're gonna have to use one of those programs it slows like it would be too fast yeah like a DOS emulator
5277248	5278609	Or wait for WiiWare.
5280031	5289079	There is a port for PlayStation, and there was one planned for Saturn that never was released.
5289359	5296446	There's a shareware version in 94 that came out after Doom came out.
5297126	5298868	Like we were saying, you have to use a software renderer.
5302438	5306283	But other than that, it was just...
5307666	5311068	Just be prepared for a trip, because you've got to fly upside down and all this stuff.
5311088	5312869	You know, it's full 360 degrees.
5313289	5317050	I mean, the way I kind of think of this game is it's like Doom without gravity.
5317751	5318011	You know?
5318051	5318311	Yeah.
5319532	5325494	Well, and on top of that, the one thing that you're having to do is that the texture mapping goes every 32 pixels.
5326975	5328116	So you deal with a lot of pop-up.
5329236	5333418	Especially if you don't have things set to emulate it just right.
5333498	5334219	You know what I mean?
5334759	5335019	Yeah.
5337325	5344110	and the engine used for it is a portal rendering engine so that you could connect different sectors.
5345211	5347293	So I thought it was pretty cool.
5348314	5354198	And they've actually released the source code without the audio in 97.
5354839	5357081	And actually the source code for Descent 2 was released in 99.
5357181	5357761	Oh, wow.
5357881	5359262	So different expansions out.
5359282	5360723	There's the Descent Mission Builder in 95.
5360824	5361184	Okay.
5363425	5388583	There was Descent Levels of the World 95, Descent Anniversary Edition that had all the other add-ons And the extra levels that Parallax made Descent on PlayStation and Descent on WiiWare that's coming out this fall As far as anything that's related to it, there was Descent Under Mountain Which was an RPG that used the Descent graphics engine But wasn't really in it And then there was the clone Forsaken, do you remember that?
5390237	5391157	Yes, I do.
5391698	5392878	Wasn't that the one that had the commercial?
5393639	5393919	Yeah.
5393959	5394839	The Future's Forsaken.
5395179	5396040	Yes, I remember that game.
5396420	5403883	And then Descent Free Space The Great War was put out by Volition in 98, but it wasn't really a Descent game.
5403923	5404624	It just shared the name.
5406425	5412407	Volition was working on Descent 4, but it was canceled in 2000 because Descent 3 didn't sell that well.
5414448	5416549	But it served as the basis for Red Faction.
5416569	5417870	Interesting.
5417910	5418270	Interesting.
5420089	5420258	So.
5421354	5421634	All right.
5421934	5422255	That's it.
5422675	5424596	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5425516	5426076	I can't believe it.
5426096	5426777	It's not Sega.
5427317	5427677	That's all right.
5427857	5428017	Hey!
5428778	5429318	No, it's a good game.
5429358	5429978	This is a great pick.
5429998	5432320	I felt it was appropriate.
5432440	5434241	It's very news appropriate.
5434681	5435021	I love it.
5435681	5438403	And it's a game I really enjoy, and I actually remember this one.
5438503	5440143	Oh, God, this game made me so motion sick.
5440304	5442044	You know what I was thinking that the Pixel ones never did?
5442665	5443325	This one, actually.
5443665	5445626	Well, it was really rudimentary 3D rendered.
5445686	5446247	It really was.
5446327	5447667	It wasn't so sprite-based.
5448087	5449108	It really was 3D rendered.
5449428	5450629	It kind of looks like Mode 7 Hell.
5451309	5452569	Yeah.
5452589	5454130	Well, except not as blurry.
5454290	5454470	Yeah.
5455190	5459752	But yeah, even watching it on YouTube is like... Blur.
5460312	5460592	All right.
5461652	5464513	But do you not see what I mean by it feels like you're tilting all the time?
5464573	5468194	No, and the full 360 motion is kind of hell on the brain.
5468334	5468914	I get what you're saying.
5469055	5469895	Oh, yeah.
5470155	5470375	All right.
5470615	5474458	Well, we got plenty more coming up when we come back from a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5474478	5475919	We're only halfway done, if even that.
5476219	5479482	We're going to talk about some moving and shaking going on on the PlayStation Network.
5479502	5483525	We're going to talk about arcades, a major arcade chain going through some big changes.
5484046	5489130	And Capcom, apparently some big news leaking out of Capcom.
5489170	5490911	Someone's breaking embargo.
5491291	5494434	We will talk a little bit about that a little later on in the show.
5494854	5495815	But, yeah, stay tuned.
5495875	5499518	We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5505319	5511121	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, April the 18th of 2010.
5511842	5515983	It should be noted that it is the night before Dark Sakura's birthday.
5516103	5517344	Birthday, birthday, birthday.
5517604	5518684	Yep, so I'm doing whatever I want.
5518804	5520105	So happy birthday, early birthday.
5520125	5520905	Do you have to work tomorrow?
5521105	5521505	No, I don't.
5521525	5522306	I ask for tomorrow off.
5522406	5522786	Nice.
5523566	5525447	That's the best birthday present you could possibly give yourself.
5525467	5526287	But guess what I have to do?
5526507	5526687	What?
5527068	5527808	Hang out at DMV.
5528528	5530750	Uh-oh, is tomorrow the day your license expires?
5530970	5532772	And I didn't schedule an appointment.
5533172	5533632	No.
5534193	5539457	Because the thing that I was working on when you got here has been eating all my time.
5539958	5541339	That and I was sick.
5542280	5542520	Sick.
5542980	5543421	That's a bummer.
5543661	5544802	Yeah, I feel a lot better now.
5544862	5547044	Well, how do you feel about turning 21?
5550507	5552148	And now you'll actually be able to drink legally.
5553929	5554670	Just kidding.
5555351	5555671	All right.
5556668	5560532	You know, whoever guesses my age, if they shut up, then I will give them a prize.
5560652	5560972	Alright.
5562214	5562994	Actually, you know what?
5563034	5564356	I don't care if people know how old I am.
5564736	5564996	Okay.
5565116	5565757	You know how old I am?
5565837	5566197	How old?
5566838	5569040	I will be, as of 2am, 34.
5571682	5572683	Congratulations.
5572864	5573684	34 years younger.
5573704	5575346	34, and I still get carded for DVDs.
5576167	5576507	Rock.
5578108	5578469	There you go.
5579355	5586617	So, and I have to say, for all of you people who were in your late teens and twenties and are whining, shut up, it gets better at 30.
5586697	5587997	It really does.
5588197	5588537	It really does.
5588558	5590798	I was really dreading 30, but like 30's been awesome.
5591018	5591278	Seriously.
5591318	5591778	So far.
5591858	5592238	So far.
5592278	5592999	Life just, seriously.
5593019	5593679	Still got a ways to go.
5593939	5594519	Because it's like.
5594539	5595259	Did you hear that, Loki?
5595299	5595899	Life gets better at 30.
5596380	5597100	How do you feel about that?
5597500	5598260	Loki's not 30 yet.
5598340	5598720	He shrugs.
5599040	5599420	Almost there.
5600341	5600541	Nah.
5602169	5610858	Well, I mean, because it's sort of like you hit this level, like, right when you were in your early 30s, that, like, all this little drama crap stops mattering.
5611539	5614562	Like, why was I worried about that?
5614762	5615683	Why do I care?
5617205	5619827	And it's like, okay, so, right.
5620468	5621529	The least that has to happen with me.
5622190	5622991	I stopped caring.
5623945	5624265	I don't know.
5624306	5627089	For me, I just found I got laid more in my 30s than I did in my 20s.
5627469	5628831	You know, just saying.
5629712	5630112	I'm kidding.
5630132	5630513	I'm kidding.
5631174	5631494	No, I'm not.
5631814	5632015	All right.
5635779	5638242	I just want to wake people up and make sure people are really paying attention.
5638663	5638923	All right.
5638943	5640845	Oh, everybody in chat is saying like, oh, I'm 27.
5640885	5640985	I'm 31.
5641025	5641105	I'm 23.
5643448	5643869	There you go.
5643889	5648375	I'm waiting for... Where's the... God, don't we have a 14-year-old that listens?
5648876	5649296	Cheeseburger.
5649316	5650037	How old is Cheeseburger?
5650137	5651439	Cheeseburger, I think, is 15 now.
5651479	5652200	Now, 15 now.
5652781	5655364	But 14, I was like, oh my gosh, do your parents know what you're doing?
5655725	5656286	And then what?
5656346	5658248	DS Master's really young too, isn't he?
5658849	5659709	Yeah, but you know what?
5659850	5660990	It's all good.
5661030	5671716	And the reason I can actually get away with saying this is because no matter how much you deny the whole, oh, I'm too old for the drama stuff when you're in your 20s, no, it still bites you.
5672976	5674057	I thought I was over it.
5674457	5676298	You're only as old as you feel.
5676998	5679199	Age ain't nothing but a number and a biological function.
5679539	5682921	All right, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news.
5682941	5683541	Back to game news.
5684102	5684322	Loki!
5685518	5685758	Yes.
5685978	5686879	Quick stuff.
5687600	5694105	Actually, believe it or not, I had a hard time kind of picking and choosing the stories for tonight because there was actually a lot of good stuff to talk about.
5694446	5698209	So some of the stuff that we really should be spending a long time talking about got pushed to this segment.
5698629	5700591	So, some quick stuff tonight.
5700851	5708294	Yeah, so the PlayStation Move, you may remember, has a controller that's sort of like the Nunchuck, but not the Nunchuck.
5708734	5717998	Well, anyways, this was recently discovered in an FCC trademark that the new controller will be called the Navigation Controller.
5718458	5725480	So the Navigation Controller to the Sony Move will be what the Nunchuck is to the Wii Remote.
5726701	5727001	Awesome.
5730004	5756332	and then apparently Lost Planet 2 is getting some more secret guest characters that you'll be able to play as including a man who has covered wars Frank West will be returning from Dead Rising including a giant teddy bear backpack that he will be carrying it's kind of really cute how the teddy bear holds his extra assault rifle
5758073	5758514	That's neat.
5758794	5762778	And then, of course, there's going to be a guy from Monster Hunter as well.
5763599	5766481	They're referring to him as the Scaly Knife Gun Dude.
5767122	5771446	But that's pretty cool that they have all these characters.
5771466	5773708	I love the fact that they gave Frank West a teddy bear.
5775390	5777712	Although Frank West in the Mega Man outfit would have been A+.
5778333	5778733	Just saying.
5779734	5780335	Well, hey.
5781624	5784305	we can dream, maybe they'll have alternate costumes or something later on
5800447	5802609	And I'm just like, oh my god.
5802909	5803569	But then again, you know what?
5803589	5809273	When I was 12, when I was your age, Cheeseburger, oh god, I'm that guy.
5809873	5819960	No, but for real, I was calling into BBSs on my modem when I was 12 and posting on message forums and talking about tons of shit a 12-year-old shouldn't be reading or talking about.
5820020	5820681	So you know what?
5822302	5828588	All I have to... I just hope your parents know it's an R-rated show, but I don't think we're a bad influence.
5828648	5831531	I like to think we teach you, you know... How to think for yourself.
5831691	5834273	And how to write proper emails.
5834694	5834934	Yes.
5835715	5846745	You've got your... Seriously, you've got politics, nutrition, speech, debate, and grammar.
5848246	5849767	and Hand Eye Coordination above all.
5850007	5850427	Yes, exactly.
5850447	5850907	From video games.
5850988	5851248	All right.
5851288	5851648	Exactly.
5851788	5852448	Anyhow, sorry, Loki.
5853169	5853409	All right.
5854109	5858131	And then other fun stuff we can be talking about here, of course.
5860373	5864355	Pillow Fight Girls, a game that will be coming to the iPhone very soon.
5865075	5870238	And it features scantily clad women having pillow fights.
5872308	5874650	Which would be a lot of people, actually.
5874870	5879995	Apparently it'll be a reprise of the 2007 Java hit, Sexy Girls.
5880555	5886220	But, of course, getting the more PG-13 rated title, Pillow Fight Girls.
5886901	5893306	Yeah, well, that's because didn't Apple crack down on a lot of those borderline porn, the softcore titles, if you will?
5893326	5896669	Yes, but they are scantily clad and well-endowed.
5899753	5900313	Well, there you go.
5901294	5901614	Alright.
5902114	5902995	Pillow fight, girls.
5903395	5905336	In other words, half naked and big boobed.
5907897	5909678	I guess that was a politically correct way of saying it.
5909778	5911218	I don't like to be politically correct anymore.
5911258	5911799	I know you don't.
5912499	5914220	Another thing she teaches on this show.
5914740	5916221	How to say it plain.
5917490	5920211	LittleBigPlanet2 might have been inadvertently confirmed.
5920571	5933995	That's because musician Christopher Leary, who goes by the pseudonym Ochire, announced on his Twitter, here we go, Twitter breaking the news again, his song Infotain Me has been licensed to Sony for LittleBigPlanet2.
5934075	5938416	This is not the first time it's been accidentally mentioned that LittleBigPlanet2 exists.
5938436	5940617	Here's a clip, by the way, what this song sounds like.
5940657	5941677	Let me skip it a little ways here.
5946741	5949122	And hearing this, it does sound very LittleBigPlanet-y.
5949842	5952343	I could see this in like a watery level or something.
5952403	5953483	Oh, that's really pretty!
5953503	5956744	Well, here's the thing too, everyone's like, oh my god, they're doing a sequel.
5957324	5971289	It could very well just be a big old download content pet that they do and add like a whole new story mode with levels and stuff, because they've already said they're not doing a sequel, but it doesn't mean they can't release a new level pack that basically has an entirely new storyline to go with it.
5972309	5974630	I think they could do a sequel.
5975490	5977570	They could get away with it and not look like jerks.
5977750	5985492	I think they've supported the first one so well that they honestly, the paintball gun, the water, all of that could have been a sequel.
5986093	5991694	And I think they would have been able to justify having that and selling the game for 40 bucks or whatever.
5992254	6018943	but uh you know if they're doing a true sequel with all new media molecule levels and a couple new elements who knows what'll be in it I think it's okay I'm not gonna get mad at them for saying before they weren't gonna do a sequel because you know what I think they resisted the temptation long enough but again I would hope that there's enough here to really justify that big two in front of it but um you know media molecule really didn't disappoint with the first game I have faith but maybe that's just me
6020023	6020744	Super Mario Galaxy 2 is on the way!
6040964	6041964	How rad was that, right?
6042004	6043165	B-Mario was actually really cool.
6044125	6045565	Right up there with Tanooki Super Mario.
6045605	6047686	Maybe not as cool as Tanooki Super Mario, but almost.
6048066	6052887	Well, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is trying to up the cute and the memorable Mario forms.
6053387	6058269	Cloud Mario is going to be one of the new Mario forms in Super Mario Galaxy 2.
6058569	6060709	So you mean he's going to be angsty and have a big sword?
6061129	6062370	No, not that.
6062950	6063990	Like a happy, fluffy cloud.
6064110	6066111	Like a Bob Ross painted cloud.
6066131	6066431	Bob Mario.
6067851	6068972	Yes, he's a Bob Mario cloud.
6068992	6069272	Bob Mario.
6069292	6070492	There you go.
6071372	6074614	He got like these white overall looking things on instead.
6074734	6078435	And what he can do with this power, he creates cloud steps.
6078915	6081636	He walks on them and can get to out of the way places.
6082136	6085177	By the way, there's also a rock form Mario in case you forgot.
6085218	6087218	So there are some new forms of Mario coming to the game.
6087238	6088219	That sounds kind of cool actually.
6088239	6089259	I gotta say, Cloud Mario sounds kind of rad.
6089279	6091520	Rock one makes me kind of think of Metal Mario from Mario 64.
6091760	6091960	Hmm.
6092480	6093300	I forgot about Metal Mario.
6093320	6094141	Like, like, like, like, like, like.
6094895	6111244	Alright, this one's a little interesting, this story, and we could probably have a much longer discussion about this, but I thought the quote was worth talking about here, and it's something I don't think everybody's really thought about, and that is, how do you handle, in a game like Def Jam Rapstar, the N-word?
6111724	6118308	And, you know, because a lot of rap music uses that word, and there's a lot of people that aren't comfortable saying that word.
6118768	6123271	So, how do you kind of address this in the development of your video game?
6124091	6132813	And there's this very interesting article, and I'll give credit to Destructoid, who I'm actually reading this from and stealing the article on, that tries to kind of tackle this topic here of this.
6133333	6141154	Now, Konami, Def Jam, 4mm Games, all the people that went into producing this game, they're using radio edits for the songs and the music videos and so forth.
6141194	6144195	So I think that way you kind of skirt around the issue.
6144955	6149976	But actually, the N-word is one that kind of shows up still.
6150356	6151977	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6171265	6190671	and so the guy at Destructoid went to Jamie King who is the chief creative officer for 4MM Games and got this quote in return and I thought this was worth sharing because you really have to think like how do you know there are some people that play rock band and even though rock band uses the radio edits some people don't want to sing the fuck and the you know they're in some of the songs right?
6190891	6197477	It actually made it really hard for me to sing a Fall Out Boy song, The Scene is Seen, it's an arms race.
6197578	6197798	Right.
6198198	6204444	Because I'm so used to singing it in the car on the radio that I just automatically insert, I'm like, it's throwing me off.
6204745	6204905	Right.
6204945	6205926	It's scoring me down.
6205946	6206486	So yeah.
6207347	6209049	So anyway, here's a quote I wanted to share.
6209570	6213675	We don't have ownership of that word, as white people, of that word.
6214095	6219702	I think the word does come up, and that is perhaps a word where, with radio edits, there is an opportunity to not say it.
6220203	6223127	We certainly don't make it a central part of the story or the career mode.
6223587	6250170	that is a very personal decision in that point in time regardless of race, creed, and color as for how you use that word in the context of the song obviously these artists are using it they've empowered it and own it to just shy away and be frightened doesn't mean we should abuse it and hopefully I think we've treated it in a respectful manner the way all these artists and their content and their work would expect us to very well thought out point on what is a very tricky otherwise issue
6250911	6252512	I just still like what Chris Rock said about it.
6252672	6253633	What?
6253793	6257475	If you're a white person in your car listening to Dre, go ahead, say it.
6259036	6262139	Go ahead and sing your Dre.
6262319	6266381	I told you about... Actually, I found a comedian recently.
6266602	6267662	I think it was Brian Reagan.
6268223	6274347	Back when I was hanging out with somebody else, we used to just go around doing the white version.
6274367	6276008	Yeah, right, right.
6276848	6280071	It was because we thought the whole thing was kind of ridiculous and funny.
6281311	6296261	Well, I mean, the origin, but now being pulled into common usage, I certainly think it's fine to take something and, you know, take something that was, you know, made for... Well, okay, here's another example, to rephrase better.
6296882	6297402	The triangle.
6298323	6299203	The big gay triangle.
6299564	6300304	You know where that came from.
6301105	6304527	That came from the concentration camps in Germany.
6305087	6308409	The triangle was used to denote that they were in a concentration camp for being gay.
6309230	6310691	But now it's a symbol of pride, right?
6312032	6326589	So, I say that if you can take something that was a sign of, you know, oppression or disrespect and make it something that you can, you know, to bind everyone together, say, hey, this is where we came from, this is us now, then I have no problem with it.
6326769	6331794	I actually would be bothered if it was taken out of the game used in that context.
6332375	6333835	You know what I mean?
6334556	6358503	Alright, well that's all I had I thought the quote was worth sharing It's a touchy, tricky subject But I thought it was a well thought out quote Especially with game design Sometimes you have to approach these It's just interesting that a freaking video game You have these sometimes very deep cultural questions That you kind of realize I'm going to have a lot of people paying attention to this game How do we kind of approach this tricky topic?
6358763	6358943	Yeah.
6359103	6360144	You know?
6360524	6366188	And that's not just with words, necessarily, but maybe images and violence and, you know, sex and whatever else.
6366268	6367188	I say it comes down to this.
6367208	6368149	If you don't like it, don't play the game.
6369430	6369790	Fair enough.
6370230	6370471	Alright.
6370771	6372552	Sorry, I didn't mean to make a long topic out of a short story.
6372572	6374693	No, but I'm glad that you brought that one up.
6374833	6375354	Alright, no problem.
6375614	6376534	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6376795	6377535	Oh, I got stuff.
6378176	6379416	Um, Rock Band!
6379496	6381778	We... Um... No, not only.
6382438	6385860	Um... But it's actually stuff that makes me very happy because it's a bunch of stuff that I like.
6385921	6386401	There's, um...
6386861	6389882	GoHate and Cambria pack coming out with Guns of Summer.
6391243	6395704	Guns of Summer, Here We Are Juggernaut, and The Broken.
6396905	6399385	The pack for 440 points.
6400946	6401986	Well, Microsoft points.
6402687	6405728	Or 200 repoints each or 160 Microsoft points each.
6406488	6410549	And then individual traffic... Tracks.
6410709	6412270	Guy I can't talk today.
6412590	6413590	All songs that I like.
6413710	6415311	There's Suzy and the Banshees, Peekaboo.
6416272	6416913	Fuck yes.
6416953	6417874	Peekaboo.
6418575	6420218	We needed more Suzy and the Banshees on a rock band.
6420238	6424764	There's a three pack out there, but Peekaboo was like their biggest mainstream song, I think.
6424824	6426387	So I'm kind of surprised that wasn't in the first group.
6426990	6431831	Supergrass, Sun Hits the Sky, I love Supergrass, and the Violet Femmes, American Music.
6432111	6438013	And the ones that are going to be on Lego Rock Band are Guns of Summer, The Broken, and Sun Hits the Sky, the Supergrass song.
6439233	6440694	Also, more stuff.
6442074	6447095	Lord of Ultima is the browser version MMO.
6447836	6448856	Oh, Shermie, get away from the glue.
6449096	6450777	Yeah, Shermie's like, what's this glue?
6450837	6451497	Sniff, sniff, sniff.
6452057	6454118	I don't like it.
6454778	6459679	But there is a beta on for this, so you could play it, but it's coming out a week, so whatever.
6460780	6465281	But it's Lords of Ultima coming out April 20th, Tuesday.
6466261	6466881	Oh, that's not a week.
6466921	6467582	That's a couple days.
6467662	6467882	Anyway.
6468882	6471403	Also, iPhone games.
6471763	6474304	Street Fighter 4 gets a new challenger.
6474864	6476724	You get Cammy for free.
6477725	6478685	Cammy and her butt.
6480663	6481003	That's it.
6482424	6482864	For free?
6482904	6484644	Are they doing like a version upgrade or something?
6484884	6485185	I guess.
6485265	6485685	It must be.
6486145	6486465	Interesting.
6487525	6492427	Alright, well let's go to ZTwitter and every week we take your Twitter topics.
6492867	6495388	You can follow us on Twitter at OLR and send us messages.
6496796	6519720	and we post little reminders about when the show is posted and when we're going to go live and sometimes especially the real big time to be following OLR on Twitter is when we're at shows because we will like post pictures and take questions and I remember last E3 I was just like okay Twitter people what do you want to see today and I let people basically I was everybody's bitch on the internet it was fun good times
6520100	6523862	Anyway, let's go to the Twitter questions and see what you guys have for us tonight.
6523902	6525443	Not a whole lot, but some good stuff.
6525803	6540951	The ShadowSniper on Twitter says, So he's setting kind of a lowish limit, but I'm assuming maybe ShadowSniper has saved enough money that maybe they want to go purchase a TV.
6542512	6543332	I'm making a guess.
6544393	6549236	I have a 52-inch, I think mine's a Samsung.
6549336	6551797	And we got ours for about $1,200, so do the math.
6552017	6558782	Maybe you can find a good 20-something, 30-something inch for around there.
6558882	6559102	Right.
6559762	6560723	And Samsung makes good stuff.
6583266	6587047	My TV, however, is 1080i only, and it works just fine.
6587988	6591169	There's been some times where I'm like, oh, I should get a 1080p, but then I'm like, why?
6591409	6593030	It's not really going to be that big a difference.
6593570	6595751	It is no difference, trust me.
6595831	6596431	I have both.
6596571	6598332	But do you think there's a difference between 720 and 1080?
6598372	6601153	That you could probably tell a little bit.
6601213	6602193	It looks a little blurry.
6602233	6610116	It's not quite as crisp, but 1080i and 1080p, seriously, if you're flipping between the two, you'd never feel a total difference.
6610756	6613279	I think ours is a 1080p, but, you know, again.
6614160	6617483	SSJ100Matt says, all I can say is don't get a Philips and get a warranty.
6617703	6619805	Ziba in our chat says, Vizio is cheap and okay.
6619825	6624109	Yeah, I have a Vizio, and I got it from Costco, which I think is a great place to buy TVs.
6624170	6627092	Now, do you know they've revoked the constant return?
6627233	6628133	I heard.
6628694	6630656	Well, people were probably abusing the hell out of it.
6630936	6631957	I was like, what took them so long?
6632678	6634340	I'm glad that we got our TV.
6634981	6636743	They still have some type of return policy, don't they?
6636783	6641067	Oh, yeah, but it's not the free returns for life, free upgrades for life, pretty much.
6641187	6642449	Yeah, so that's good.
6642469	6643710	I'm glad they got rid of that.
6644010	6644531	They needed to.
6645032	6645292	All right.
6648435	6649236	Oops, I was looking at the wrong.
6649256	6649697	Let me put it this way.
6652159	6654501	ShadowSniper sent us that tweet twice and I got thrown off.
6654622	6654842	Sorry.
6654962	6656103	Oh yeah, Loki, you had an answer.
6656283	6659827	No, I was going to say refurbished stuff also is not bad.
6660127	6665372	We had our first HDTV was a refurbished... I don't remember what brand it was now.
6665792	6667394	I think make sure it's factory refurb, right?
6667751	6676297	Yeah, it was factory referred, but the only really difference between that and the current model is it didn't have an HDMI port, which I could care less because I don't really use it.
6677058	6677638	I do now.
6677718	6682982	I use it on my PlayStation 3 because I just don't want to have to swap HD components and stuff.
6683002	6688185	But, I mean, if you really wanted to, you could get, like, a converter for that, but it's not a big deal.
6688325	6691187	But, you know, we got ours, I think, for $800 a while back, but...
6694069	6700495	I now have a Sony 40-inch Bravia, I think.
6700795	6701256	It's not bad.
6701647	6703169	Shadow Sniper, I hope you're in chat.
6703209	6706952	I don't see your name unless you're on something else in chat, but there's like all the chatters are jumping in here.
6707993	6711336	Cheeseburger says, I got a 24-inch Asus from Newegg.
6711396	6713138	It's 1080p and I love it for gaming.
6713438	6714339	Dude, you're 16.
6714379	6715040	How did you get that?
6716141	6716982	You must have a job already.
6717022	6717302	I don't know.
6717782	6719104	Or got some money from the parents.
6719124	6719404	I don't know.
6720705	6722887	ActDev says, 32-inch, you're not going to notice a difference.
6723047	6725410	And Wyland says, I have a 1080p 42-inch Sharp.
6725450	6725790	I got it for $500.
6727131	6727451	Whew!
6727852	6729493	Maybe I need to get in the market for a new TV now.
6730053	6730294	Here we go.
6730314	6731274	I've had mine for a while.
6731394	6740541	They have a ViewSonic 32-inch 1080p LCD HDTV on Newegg for $499.99, $40 for shipping.
6741202	6744624	And Shaoran says, I'm still running the same SDTV I have for five years.
6744684	6745685	It does what it needs to do.
6745705	6746226	Or actually...
6746866	6751729	They also have another Toshiba one that's actually also 10 EP.
6752050	6753070	$5 shipping, though, on that one.
6753171	6759415	So I'd say that's probably the best or cheapest one you're going to find.
6759435	6761877	Actually, let me get into some of this.
6762697	6764198	Loki's just shopping on Newegg.com.
6764258	6764579	Check it out.
6765519	6768281	The other thing, too, is actually watch Sella.Woot.com.
6769662	6770122	Oh yeah.
6770323	6770723	And Woot.
6771223	6773685	Oh yeah, Woot will have some good TVs.
6773725	6774225	It's $5 shipping.
6774465	6775626	Exactly, $5 shipping.
6775646	6777667	That's where I need to buy a new TV is Woot.com, honestly.
6778328	6778728	Keep an eye out.
6778988	6780069	Okay, we gotta get some other tweets.
6780089	6780830	We've spent a lot of time on that one.
6780850	6781310	One last little one.
6781370	6781750	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6782150	6783932	Best Buy, look in their returns.
6783952	6787174	A lot of times stuff's brought back because it's dinged on the side or something.
6787234	6790656	If you don't care about what it looks like on the outside of it, you can get a good deal.
6790796	6796180	We got our refrigerator for like $300 off and our dryer for like two-thirds the cost.
6796500	6796760	Oh wow.
6796780	6797761	Because they were just dinged.
6797781	6798802	That's not bad.
6800283	6808488	Satur on our Twitter says, playing Harvest Moon, friends of Mineral Town on my GBA, waiting for Harvest Moon, Hero of Leaf Valley to come out on the PSP.
6808528	6810229	I guess that's a little bit of his gaming week right there.
6810609	6811450	Harvest Moon.
6812190	6814031	I'm surprised that's a series I didn't get more into.
6814172	6814452	I don't know.
6815312	6841182	Tiger Claw sends us some links on Twitter this one was originally in the show roll and I bumped it for something else that I wanted to talk about more it was about No Doubt and apparently No Doubt they have won the first few skirmishes in the battle with Activision I guess Activision wanted the thing thrown out of court because it was a lawsuit without merit but guess what the Los Angeles County Superior Court they ruled in favor of No Doubt so they rejected the shift to a federal court
6841762	6847328	and rejected Activision's efforts to try and put free speech injunctions involved.
6848189	6849751	I'm kind of not surprised by that move.
6849791	6852454	I think No Doubt could have a very good argument here.
6852494	6854136	It's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out.
6854616	6856438	I'd really love to see the contract they signed.
6856799	6860523	I mean, without being able to read that, it's hard for me to take sides in this.
6861364	6863506	So it's very interesting to see what's going to happen in court of law.
6865544	6876432	Also, I think worthy of mention, Tigerclaw sends this on Twitter, StarCraft 2, this is very recent news, StarCraft 2 has been given an adults-only rating in South Korea.
6876632	6880775	If a game gets an adults rating over here, only rating over here, it can be kind of damning.
6881775	6884777	Blizzard was shooting for an over 12 rating in the country.
6884937	6887238	Originally, they had been assigned an over 15.
6887718	6891560	They sent a newer build to the game or something, and now they got adults only.
6892061	6893421	No word on why.
6894062	6899785	Joke all you want about the addiction level of the game, seeing as this is South Korea, but I don't think that plays a part in it.
6900745	6901245	It might.
6901746	6904267	It could, I don't know, but Blizzard's going to appeal it, of course.
6904627	6905628	And they'll probably get their way.
6905748	6905968	I mean...
6907369	6910831	The release of that game is going to be a cultural event over there.
6912673	6913794	It's on the scale of a...
6915100	6916440	I don't know what are the huge releases here.
6916520	6919661	Modern Warfare, Halo, Final Fantasy type release, obviously.
6921101	6925862	Spazinator says, I guess for tonight's show, the show's been renamed Orange Bra Radio, huh?
6926183	6927683	Maybe that's what we need to sell, DarkSakura.
6927703	6928323	We should look into that.
6928443	6929303	Bras that are orange?
6930103	6930303	No.
6930363	6931404	For the lady fans of the show?
6931964	6932124	No.
6932224	6933904	With OLR right on the cups?
6934484	6935005	No.
6935045	6936565	Redertainment says...
6937225	6945767	is there a reason why Activision hasn't created their own bank in real life sure it might be illegal but that hasn't stopped companies before creating their own bank
6947264	6948725	Do you mean like buying all their stock?
6948845	6950947	I don't know.
6951568	6953610	I think he's being silly, but I don't know if I really get the joke.
6954611	6961697	Sponchtwang says to us on Twitter, Let DSMaster26 know I would take him up on his DDR Perfect Attack Challenge.
6962157	6964479	LOL, I only have access to songs on Supernova 2.
6965440	6970084	Well, you guys, you might want to try to find each other on Twitter and just YouTube the battle.
6970104	6970645	That's all we need.
6972942	6978027	DJ Ranma S is sending us a message saying, I don't remember you guys saying that the slim Xbox 360 was a fake.
6978968	6982812	I don't remember saying it either because I thought it was actually definitely a plausible idea.
6983092	6983833	I don't think it's fake.
6984194	6985014	I don't think it's fake either.
6985695	6987297	Was it proven fake this week or something?
6987317	6987937	I didn't see anything.
6987977	6988838	If it was, I missed it.
6989299	6990139	No, I don't think.
6990159	6991160	I haven't seen anything.
6991701	6992242	It's real.
6992422	6992922	I mean, seriously.
6993002	6994724	If something did happen, it'll be in chat soon.
6994744	6995024	We'll see.
6995965	6998367	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some other gaming news.
6999428	6999708	Loki.
7000589	7004712	Yeah, I was going to say, it's definitely happening.
7005792	7008654	One thing that is not happening, though, would be PlayStation Room.
7009135	7015239	What is Room, you may ask, because you might have forgotten since they haven't really mentioned anything other than what it was teased, I think.
7015459	7016841	I don't remember if it was Tokyo Game Show.
7016901	7018602	I think it was Tokyo Game Show is where they showed it off.
7019182	7022545	Anyways, PlayStation Room was sort of like home.
7023045	7037235	It was like a social networking service that was going to be available for the PSP where you had little characters or avatars that kind of looked like almost like Miis or your avatars that you have on Xbox Live.
7037935	7047462	But apparently it finished the Japanese-only closed beta and they decided that they're going to cease development on the service.
7050530	7052211	Oh well, I guess that's not coming.
7054392	7060215	They just pulled the plug because there just wasn't going to be enough interest in it or too many resources or home didn't take off the way they wanted it to?
7060235	7064978	Probably because they're going to save it for the next PlayStation portable platform.
7065018	7065958	That's a darn good thought.
7065998	7066859	I bet that's really it.
7067779	7069520	By the way, Ranma wanted to clarify his tweet.
7069540	7076284	He sent us a link to a news article on Xboxic.com talking about the recent Xbox 360 Slim images are fake.
7076664	7082146	and it shows a picture of a reported Xbox 360 Slim and it's just an HD DVD player tilted the wrong way.
7082566	7083486	Okay, that's fair enough.
7083606	7087467	Yeah, that picture is obviously fake but that's not the same picture that came up on the show a couple weeks ago.
7087868	7091729	So it might be disputing this story is a fake but I think...
7093161	7107215	pictures or not I still think the concept of the Xbox 360 slim and just some of the things that were being talked about at that time I think are certainly still plausible although certainly there are going to be many websites out there that claim to have it even though they don't because they're lying liars
7109662	7109882	I agree.
7109962	7112484	And they need to get the people who did his stuff on Mugen to make him.
7112665	7113105	Alright.
7113125	7114526	So, I have to agree to that.
7135771	7139536	All right, well, let's talk about more PlayStation news.
7139556	7140837	And this is actually really important.
7141498	7145403	PlayStation news, they usually do the network updates on Thursdays.
7145843	7147906	That is actually going to be changing.
7148426	7154013	And the theory is that this is actually part of the response to actually why the Xbox does their releases.
7154734	7155175	Here's the deal.
7156664	7161810	The American and European PlayStation Store updates, they are moving starting in May to new days.
7162211	7166596	And PlayStation Network in North America will now be Tuesdays.
7167237	7169099	In Europe, it will be now on Wednesday.
7170260	7171101	Kind of interesting.
7171482	7172023	Interesting.
7172583	7179188	I think there are people out there that might buy games on Microsoft just because they can get them two days before they do on PS3.
7180069	7184693	Do you think that that's true, Loki, that there's people out there that buy games on 360 simply because you can get it like two days before?
7185053	7185333	No.
7185934	7186154	Really?
7186254	7186714	I doubt it.
7187115	7187375	Really?
7188035	7190377	It's just basically forum bragging rights.
7190417	7191018	That's about it.
7191078	7192759	Huh, we get the game earlier than you do.
7192879	7193059	That's...
7194580	7204143	I think there is a small, it's small, but I think there's a group of people out there that knowing they can get the game a day sooner on the PS3 will opt to get it on the PS3.
7204203	7209744	Yeah, well I guess they would be able to say, hey, you know, you can get the game here first.
7210224	7212045	You know, they can use that tagline or whatever.
7213683	7213883	Hmm.
7214745	7215226	Well, there you go.
7215466	7220636	The updates are moving to be a little more competitive with Microsoft, although they didn't say that, of course, in the update.
7220676	7223681	But I'm sure they were like, oh, we're doing it because we want to be earlier.
7223822	7223882	No.
7225242	7226563	I didn't watch the video of the release.
7226623	7228405	All you need to know is that it's moving two days back.
7228465	7233830	And now it's going to get very interesting to see if that changes sales figures or not.
7234310	7234651	We'll see.
7234991	7235692	Hey, Rob.
7235792	7236132	What's that?
7237493	7238775	Who was it that just posted that?
7239775	7240096	Ziba?
7240816	7240997	Yes.
7241117	7248704	Put a deals.woot link in for a 42-inch 1080p LCD HDTV with three HDMI inputs refurbished for $549.99.
7250453	7250753	Really?
7251393	7253834	Yep Hold on, I'm looking at this right now Is it still like $5 shipping?
7253954	7277721	It's Philips, we were warned Oh yeah, that's right, we were warned about Philips And I'm going to tell everybody Whenever you're going through any of these sites and everything There were a few people who actually said they recommended that it was great But always check Consumer Reports before you buy anything Good idea, especially before you spend that kind of money Free shipping even, interesting It's tempting
7279261	7281142	There's people in here who said they did a good job with it.
7281563	7282103	Interesting.
7282744	7283484	I'll have to think about it.
7283565	7285386	SSJ100Mad is very anti-Phillips, though.
7285406	7287648	I'll have to hear more about his story before I decide to do it.
7287968	7288649	But thank you, Ziba.
7288669	7289570	I appreciate you looking out.
7289890	7290250	Kiss, kiss.
7290330	7295635	And there's a $10 coupon off at buy.com.
7297062	7297382	DarkSakura
7315951	7316572	Other stuff.
7316872	7317693	Dun-da-dun.
7318794	7320035	This is actually really sad news.
7321396	7329644	Sega has made a business decision and they are closing half of their GameWorks arcades.
7331045	7331666	That, um...
7333806	7340390	They, uh, are, you can't, no more good beer, no more good, god, they had good food.
7341390	7353076	Um, they're not saying which exactly ones are going to be closing, but, um, they're going to be, uh, closing, uh, seven, actually, well, less than half, but just under half.
7353176	7359660	Seven of the 15 locations, some of them being Minneapolis, Long Beach, Columbus, Detroit, Indianapolis, Miami, and Tampa.
7360280	7361180	But Seattle will live.
7361200	7361821	In theory.
7361841	7362161	In theory.
7362881	7366422	Well, this, I'm sorry, but this news story calls for a little bit of sad trombone.
7370464	7370904	There you go.
7371525	7373565	Yeah, that puts sadness into my heart.
7374126	7375026	Well, it is sad.
7375206	7376727	Arcades closing is sad.
7377667	7384210	I mean, I honestly feel like just within the lifespan of our show, we have literally watched arcades die.
7385185	7385726	You know what I mean?
7386526	7387087	It is sad.
7387167	7388128	It is sad trombone.
7388168	7389469	It's worse than sad trombone.
7389529	7391111	It's sad elephone.
7392112	7392933	It's sad tuba.
7393373	7393673	Yes.
7394254	7396096	It's just unfortunate.
7396796	7398258	Because we all met at the arcade.
7398338	7402602	I don't know if the show would happen if we had all met on Xbox Live or something different.
7402862	7406626	It's just sad that arcades are closing down.
7406646	7407126	It's not a surprise.
7407146	7409709	But the arcades that we met at is still open.
7409989	7410269	It is.
7411750	7412610	But it's different now.
7412751	7414151	You know, you go over there, it's just not the same.
7414291	7415252	I haven't been there in years.
7415392	7415832	It's weird.
7418073	7418954	So, all right.
7419494	7421755	Well, sorry to hear about the GameWorks closing.
7421996	7424237	More sorry to hear about the people who lose their jobs because of it.
7424617	7424857	Yeah.
7425177	7425918	That's the other big bummer.
7425938	7427158	Shout out to SadBananaPhone.
7427398	7428539	That's right, SadBananaPhone.
7429059	7429620	All right, Loki.
7429640	7431641	That would be, what, the banana phone song in a minor key?
7432681	7432901	Maybe.
7432921	7433862	I've never heard, actually.
7434362	7435843	Is there a SadBananaPhone?
7436083	7437404	Like, I have to hear this.
7437444	7438064	SadBananaPhone.
7438084	7438484	No, Rob.
7440586	7448610	So apparently the MPD numbers for March are out and people are declaring Red Steel 2 a flop.
7449370	7454392	Apparently the game only sold 50,000 copies in its opening month.
7455613	7457294	Okay, let's stop it right there.
7457654	7462857	Yeah, they sold 50,000 copies in the first, what, 12 days that it was out?
7463497	7463817	14 days?
7465078	7469200	So I wouldn't exactly call it a flop, but it is kind of on par with the other
7471334	7473378	The other Wii mature games, I guess, are out there.
7473418	7475141	Even though it is teen rated, but still.
7477826	7481232	I can confirm, though, it did sell about 50,000 copies.
7481272	7482014	It was like 49,000 and change.
7482034	7482134	But...
7486027	7486287	I don't know.
7515004	7524634	I wouldn't say that's really a good comparison either, but definitely it has been the trend that hardcore games like Red Steel haven't done well on the Wii.
7525434	7526956	So we'll see if maybe this will break the mold.
7531506	7537131	I guess it is probably too early to declare it a flop, but do you think there'll be a Red Steel 3, or is it just too early to tell, period?
7537151	7537911	Oh yeah, I'm sure there will be.
7538252	7555505	And here's the thing, it's like, the same thing happened with DJ Hero, where they're like, oh, it didn't sell for shit, and they really only had, what, a week worth of data to go off of, so you have to just look at the amount of time that's passed and where it's coming out in the month.
7556246	7558267	If it came out, say, in the first week in March,
7559208	7560309	Then it would be a different story.
7560489	7567352	Then, yes, it would be over a month that had passed, but those numbers would be reflecting at least most of the month.
7567792	7569793	And, yeah, that would be a flop.
7569873	7576796	But seeing that it came out kind of at the end of the month, I wouldn't really call it a flop yet.
7577837	7582099	Once the April NPD numbers come out, then you can call it a flop.
7583732	7587697	PlanetXbox360.com is running a report saying that their tipster, who's been right 19 out of 20 times... I'd like to know the one they were wrong on...
7599831	7622886	but the tipster is saying that Capcom had its Captivate press event over in Hawaii this past weekend and apparently what was being shown at the event well final builds of Lost Planet 2 and Dead Rising 2 which is to be expected but there were also some surprise announcements that happened at this event that you just haven't heard about yet for whatever reasons probably because the journalists are still coming back
7623806	7626427	or they are embargoes for a certain day.
7626507	7627947	Absolutely, that's probably what's going on.
7628167	7629447	Because you know why they do embargoes?
7630188	7631788	Well, I'll get into that rant in a minute.
7631928	7634108	Yeah, I know why they do embargoes.
7634169	7635789	Yeah, there's two reasons they do embargoes.
7635809	7636589	We'll get into that in a minute.
7636609	7644771	But first, the leaks that they're talking about, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is supposedly going to be one of the games that comes out of this.
7645351	7645692	DarkSakura
7666874	7670156	Apparently, they spotted a Marvel employee at the event.
7670956	7674478	The Twitter account for Marvel vs. Capcom popped back up recently.
7675399	7678500	Yeah, I mean, it all kind of seems like this is going on.
7678600	7685243	They are just saying they're going to blow fans out of the water with the sheer number of characters the game includes on the disc.
7685724	7689145	It will be a 2D game, but think Street Fighter 4.
7691006	7692688	Street Fighter 4 had its 3D elements.
7693469	7697493	As far as that goes, I can't see how that is not true.
7697933	7701837	Because, I mean... That's going to be all sorts of awesome.
7701937	7707362	Capcom has been awesome at sucking the fanboy wank for the past...
7707762	7708643	A couple years now.
7708703	7709503	I mean, think about it.
7709783	7711665	Think about the projects that Capcom's done.
7712085	7716568	Oh, we should do a Street Fighter 4 that's a little more inspired by Street Fighter 2 and it's like 2D.
7717109	7718349	Okay, is that what you want, guys?
7718450	7718890	You got it.
7719410	7723873	Oh, you want a new Mega Man game that's just like Mega Man 2 and the old school games you love on the NES?
7724214	7725494	Okay, guys, you got it.
7725955	7726195	What?
7726275	7730358	You want us to remake Bionic Commando and make it all souped up for Xbox Live?
7730818	7733060	Oh, okay, you crazy kids, you got it.
7733520	7734041	Like, really?
7734481	7740726	I mean, hasn't Capcom, almost more so than any other company as of late, been like, fanboy wank, you want it, you got it.
7741406	7743948	Well, because they know if there's a cry for it, people are going to spend money on it.
7743988	7746810	Exactly, and what is the next thing people have been crying for?
7746950	7748151	Marvel vs. Capcom.
7748431	7753155	And the only reason people say it's not happening is because of agreements and deals and Marvel and da-da-da.
7753635	7755617	But when Marvel's got all these movies they want to do...
7756616	7758537	Dark Tetsuya says, so more than the 56 that were in Marvel vs. Capcom 2?
7758577	7759017	Holy fuck.
7759057	7760697	I guess so, if this is to be believed.
7760777	7762458	I don't know.
7762498	7764018	Again, it seems very logical.
7764138	7764498	And why not?
7783659	7810678	Bionic Commando Rearm 2 also being shown at the press event apparently there I guess is not much about this there was just a trailer that was shown but apparently they're saying there will be more at E3 2010 but the big big announcement was Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so there you go I guess you'll hear more about it this week now do we want to go on to the topic of embargoes and why you're not hearing about this right now please do keep in mind these journalists went to Hawaii Hawaii
7811806	7814509	and all these other things that come with it and I mean
7827508	7831251	I don't know, there's a part of me that's kind of like, wow, that's almost, I don't know.
7831311	7834273	You're going to have to take reviews of these games with a grain of salt.
7834333	7836255	Well, there's something also here.
7836275	7839657	I'd just like to point this out because this was on Joystick.
7839717	7842599	It was a little kind of note at the bottom.
7842620	7845782	It says, editor's note, Joystick is not attending Captivate this year.
7845842	7852447	We determined that the perceived environment and the associated downtime of the event was not in accordance with our editorial policy.
7853387	7858471	We expected to provide complete coverage of all the Capcom titles shown at Captivate during E3 this June.
7859091	7862954	And then for more information on our policies, they have a link.
7862994	7870439	And basically, I actually read through their policies where they don't keep any of the promotional stuff that they give them the kind of, you know...
7872020	7872580	and DarkSakura.com.
7901906	7902947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7920933	7931778	Big websites like 1up.com, GamePro, IGN, they all were suddenly running stories on certain games shown at this event.
7932138	7935320	But each website was showing one different game.
7937586	7944729	Um, and we were kind of sitting here going, um, well, why did we do those embargoes then?
7944989	7954612	And it just, you know, the kind of the realization was that, oh, these guys probably had sold exclusive deals with these companies to get the first coverage on the game.
7954652	7962155	Because, you know, you know that if IGN is the first one that's going to run a news story on, let's make something up, Capcom, Resident Evil.
7962215	7963656	Let's say Resident Evil 6 is announced.
7964136	7966337	IGN has an exclusive deal to announce Resident Evil 6.
7967057	7970402	The deal is they'll say what the company wants them to say and they'll get hits from it.
7970762	7973226	It's kind of shady, the stuff that goes on.
7974007	7982880	Or they'll allow them to say later on get a good deal on placing those giant splash ads that cover the entire background of their front page or something like that.
7983806	7987648	Yeah, it's shady, but that's how the big boys do it.
7988908	7995832	Well, that's why I'm perfectly fine with our show being off the radar, even if we suffer in the number of listeners because of it.
7997032	7998193	We have integrity.
7998373	8002635	If a game company wanted to fly me to Hawaii to check out their game schedule, I'm not going to say no.
8003135	8005237	I don't think we have that same editorial policy.
8005498	8010002	But I think the general understanding is that we're going to be honest at the end of the day, period.
8010343	8016930	But I can see where people might be like, oh, but you getting all this lavish treatment, you're going to have a biased opinion on the game.
8017290	8019172	And that's why Joystick has the policy they do.
8019232	8019713	Not really.
8020133	8020694	I can't imagine.
8020714	8021274	I don't either.
8021474	8025859	I've gone to events and seen games and said, you know what, they need to work on this.
8026159	8030182	We've gone to Konami events and there's a lot of stuff that we've been pretty negative about.
8030202	8034165	That's why we're not invited to Konami events anymore.
8039049	8039469	You know what?
8040310	8048636	Until you stop going to IGN for you news and until you stop going to the very first website that cracks all this information, this trend will continue.
8049036	8049436	Period.
8049736	8050617	So I'll bet you what?
8050677	8052879	I bet you some website beats the others to the punch.
8053879	8056100	on this news, assuming it turns out to be true.
8056881	8058201	Which, again, I'm sure it is.
8059102	8061243	This would make perfect sense for Capcom, period.
8062403	8064645	This is more of a, well, Marvel, let them do it question.
8064665	8067206	This is rumored to be revealed in a few weeks anyway.
8067846	8068246	That's true.
8068266	8069167	It was already going around.
8071648	8075970	Oh, now some people are bringing up the whole... I'm sure they were buying the 10s they were going to give in their review.
8076430	8079972	That kind of references the whole... Oh, God, what was it?
8080112	8080932	It was Games...
8082270	8086916	Yes, Kane and Lynch and GameSpot and the guy ended up leaving over it.
8087057	8087577	Oh man.
8088619	8089640	Oh man, what a mess.
8090661	8093245	Actdeft wanted to reiterate that Kotaku has a similar policy.
8093305	8094687	I just, I missed it, okay?
8094927	8095748	I've been gone all weekend.
8095888	8098132	But I'm sure there's lots of websites that have a very similar policy.
8098412	8099754	So then my question would be, who went?
8101167	8101507	I don't know.
8101547	8103027	And apparently not everybody can be trusted.
8103087	8104448	Somebody blabbed their mouth to Planet Xbox 360.
8104528	8109229	I didn't see anybody saying, hey, we're going to Captivate and we'll be talking about it.
8109329	8110109	Because it's embargoed.
8110129	8110949	They can't say they're going.
8110969	8113870	Well, big Capcom news as soon as I get home from Hawaii.
8119051	8119391	Anyhow.
8119951	8120951	Alright, let's move on.
8121591	8122712	We're going to get to the mailbag.
8123252	8124592	Every week you guys send us emails.
8124632	8128993	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we like to crack open the mailbag and read them here on the air.
8131808	8133888	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, DarkSakura.
8133988	8135089	Dive in the mailbag, head first.
8135129	8135809	Pull out some emails.
8135989	8136629	You know what, Rob, though?
8136669	8137410	I have to say, you know what?
8137430	8138190	It sounded like you said.
8138290	8138490	Huh?
8138630	8140611	You have to crap out.
8141851	8143572	It did sound like what you said.
8143612	8145713	Why don't you crap out some emails, DarkSakura?
8145833	8147373	How about you bite my butt, Rob?
8147773	8149254	Not if you're going to crap out emails.
8149594	8150814	You're the one who brought up crap.
8151335	8151555	Okay.
8152575	8155037	Dear OLR crew, long time no email.
8155418	8160261	So I figured I would chime in my thoughts regarding the shutdown of Halo 2 Xbox Live support.
8160802	8165926	Really, I'm not that sad to buy it, seeing how I've already moved on from the game, occasionally playing Halo 3 online.
8166426	8169569	But the enjoyment I got out of Halo 2 actually wasn't from the online play.
8169669	8177755	I remember back in the day when me and my friends used to schedule a Halo party where everyone would bring a TV in their systems and play via system link.
8177816	8178936	It was a freaking blast.
8178976	8179837	You know, we used to do that.
8180398	8181518	Dan's bachelor party.
8182560	8185752	was a Halo LAN party using the system link.
8188773	8193016	What would be nice is if Bungie made a Halo 2 map pack for Halo 3.
8193716	8197279	Because honestly, the maps in Halo 3 are boring in comparison, at least for me.
8198039	8201982	Oh, how I long for the headshots on Coagulation and the headlong once more.
8202442	8203603	Thanks for reading, Osfer.
8203943	8204304	P.S.
8204564	8209347	Here's a link to a simple but really moving YouTube that you can watch in your own time.
8210508	8211609	You didn't put the link on here.
8212009	8215631	It's a simple walk through the multiplayer maps of the game set to songs from the Halo 2 soundtrack.
8216052	8216552	Ah, memories.
8217737	8220878	You know, I'm such a bad, bad, bad gaming journalist.
8220898	8222318	This is why I don't go to Hawaii.
8222978	8224959	I forgot that the Xbox closure was this week.
8224999	8227580	But to be fair, there wasn't anything I was playing regularly on Xbox.
8227600	8229800	I mean, yeah, Halo 2 I used to play back in the day.
8230200	8234462	But most of the guys that used to play that together with me have kind of moved on to just other games in general.
8234882	8236442	You know, be it Halo 3 or what have you.
8236462	8237202	So, yeah, that's right.
8237242	8238643	I forgot the shutdown was this past week.
8238663	8241184	Hey, don't say fuck Halo, Zen Thrill Zen.
8241324	8241564	All right.
8242024	8242584	You know what?
8243845	8245646	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8272961	8276982	But you've got to wonder how they're going to kind of toss out the bone, if you will, to the Halo 2 fans.
8277283	8280684	And I think putting out the maps in Halo 3 is actually a really good idea.
8281864	8283845	Especially if you can somehow put in the Halo 2 rules.
8283925	8284285	I don't know.
8285105	8286726	Or you just let it die.
8286866	8287206	I don't know.
8288871	8315514	we'll see maybe but yeah rest in peace Xbox Live on regular Xbox oh but I am so welcome to now my friends list will hopefully very soon I don't know when this is rolling out but hopefully in the next couple months after E3 I will be able to have a friends list with over 100 people because I feel really bad because I have to delete people because new people will want to add me and I'm like oh yeah I really want to have you on my list shit but I have 100 friends okay who hasn't signed on in the past two weeks
8315814	8323518	I think I'm the Studio 54 of Xbox Live because I'll just delete people because I've decided that they're not elite enough.
8324278	8324818	No, I'm kidding.
8325719	8326779	I just, I feel bad.
8326799	8329801	And if you're an OLR listener and I deleted you, I'm really, really sorry.
8329861	8331141	It's just my list is full.
8331421	8332782	He's not really sorry.
8332882	8339425	I am, but just people I know in real life and actually see outside of, you know, the internet get precedence.
8339465	8340126	They get preference.
8340646	8343067	But as soon as Xbox ups the limit, open season again.
8343227	8343627	I promise.
8343727	8345048	You can all add me and I'll add you back.
8348810	8352012	This person is doing this just to annoy me, so thank you for messing with me.
8352853	8354294	Yo, OLR, what up?
8354474	8362300	This sentence is for, number four, DarkSakura, to read because I'm a bad enough dude to type like this.
8362760	8365922	Grammar and all around linguistics is not me forte.
8368084	8369165	Anyway, on to serious business.
8369185	8370126	I have a question for Loki.
8370587	8376653	Is it possible to hook up mix-slash-soundboard up to an Xbox 360 controller and play sound clips over Xbox Live?
8377093	8386983	Because when I play Call of Duty or any game with multiplayer in it, you're usually dealing with 12-year-olds that one out of every two words that come out of their mouth is something not pleasant.
8387544	8388245	Don't get me wrong.
8388325	8389126	I love expletives.
8389386	8390787	Like the fuck show is funny as shit.
8391568	8393330	But not racial slurs or other bigotry.
8393850	8398334	If I can get a soundboard, I would download a bunch of sounds and just fuck with people.
8398694	8399415	Only dickheads, though.
8400256	8404560	Anyway, I got to go watch all the new stuff they added on Netflix like Firefly.
8404680	8406441	I heard it was really good until it was cancelled.
8406581	8407302	Well, buh-bye.
8407903	8408983	Duh money, 125.
8409244	8411025	And yeah, Firefly is excellent.
8411125	8411986	Watch the whole thing.
8412126	8415069	They aired it out of order and they just treated it badly.
8415489	8416270	And then watch the movie.
8416650	8417011	Seriously.
8418327	8418608	P.S.
8418988	8424175	This email is brought to you by Orange Knowledge Radio, your number one source for news, previews, reviews, and talk for all things Halo.
8424215	8424635	Just kidding.
8426557	8428800	Isn't that ironic considering the past email we just got?
8429301	8429721	I know, right?
8429922	8431023	LOL, WTF.
8431483	8431984	LOL.
8433025	8433566	I don't know, Loki.
8433586	8435869	Can you hook up a soundboard to the Xbox controller?
8436260	8436980	Yeah, of course you can.
8437421	8445685	All you would need to do is basically just get the right connector to plug into your Xbox 360 controller.
8448747	8451729	You'd basically just be running a cord from your PC or whatever.
8451929	8453690	I guess PC would probably be the easiest.
8454390	8456111	And running it into your controller.
8457092	8459493	And you just need some sort of headset adapter.
8460173	8474409	and they actually do have one of those I think available I'm looking here right now looks like Intech made one of those although I'm not sure if that just plugs converts it to any headset or what would that mean we could broadcast our show on Xbox Live?
8475550	8479272	We could start an Xbox Live party and then invite people in and we could actually broadcast our show on Xbox Live.
8479292	8480812	You can only have so many people in your party though.
8480832	8482033	It's like four or something.
8482713	8483453	I wish there was a way.
8483493	8484574	Exclusive!
8484774	8493017	Could we just get in a Halo match and just stand there where no one can shoot us somehow and just do our show to random people on Halo?
8493037	8494698	We'd be doing it red versus blue style.
8496915	8499757	I think this though would work.
8500457	8501258	I'm not positive.
8501278	8504560	It says it's an Xbox 360 headset adapter from Intech.
8504980	8508261	It says it'll allow you to plug in any 2.5mm jack plug.
8513644	8521790	and I think... God, I don't remember what size jack plugs there are for different things.
8522811	8540884	I'm sure though, seriously though, you can probably go online or even to Radio Shack or something like that and just basically bring your controller with you and you can probably find some sort of an adapter or if you want, use this adapter with a converter to convert it to the correct size that you need.
8543087	8548939	And it does have volume and mute controls on there as well, so if you want to shut it off so you're not bugging everybody, you can do that.
8551149	8558154	I've wanted to do that as well because I think it'd be funny just to play stuff over live, but some people don't like that.
8558874	8561676	That's actually not the only way you can do that.
8561836	8568281	There's another way you can actually do it, and I've seen it happen, and I was going to call somebody to talk about it, but they're testing.
8568641	8569361	I'll come back to this.
8569541	8570842	I want to come back to this topic in just a minute.
8570982	8572283	So, DarkSakura, do the next email.
8573244	8574265	Oh, we only have one more email.
8574425	8574605	Okay.
8575545	8579348	So, moving forward, and ha ha, funny da money.
8580453	8582895	Rob said something like, most DS owners are kids.
8582975	8584136	And this is by the way from Robaba.
8585136	8586257	At first I thought, no.
8586557	8589940	But if you really think about it, what is the most kid-friendly game console around?
8590260	8593102	By kid-friendly, think about these factors and not the M ratings.
8593842	8595123	One, you can put it in your pocket.
8595163	8598445	PSP Go and the iPhone slash iPod Touch are the only others.
8598986	8602108	The DS is the only system that protects its own screen without peripherals.
8602268	8603109	Very pocket-friendly.
8604129	8605191	2.
8604250	8605191	Kids are destructive.
8605311	8605811	Part 1.
8606132	8611738	The portable system will probably get destroyed or lost at some point, which is the cheapest to replace, hence its initials are DNS.
8612840	8611738	3.
8613080	8614061	Kids are destructive.
8614141	8614602	Part 2.
8615302	8618146	The games are solid state chips as opposed to UMDs.
8618286	8622090	UMDs get crushed easily, whereas the DS chips survive most falls and step-ons.
8622991	8623952	4.
8623211	8623952	Parents are cheap.
8624613	8626054	Most of the cheap games are on the DS.
8626234	8629897	I'm still waiting for Imagine having fun.
8629917	8629897	5.
8629997	8632019	DS has buttloads of simpler games for the very young.
8632459	8636983	I have to admit I used these priorities to pick a DS over the PSP for the nephews when they were younger.
8637443	8639705	So I'm inclined to believe you were right for your comment.
8640245	8641426	Did I send this email back in 2005?
8641686	8643648	Kind of deja vu moment for me.
8643768	8644709	Of course I was right.
8645229	8649132	And poor Jamie, I just wanted to jump through the internet time machine and buy her soup.
8649713	8649853	Aww.
8650373	8652415	I hope you were surviving your allergies slash plague.
8652615	8652975	Rub-a-ba.
8653656	8654436	Um, yeah, it was funny.
8654876	8658839	I had bad allergies, and then, um, I was sick.
8659040	8659760	I ate a lot of cake.
8660581	8660881	And beer.
8661682	8663223	And then, um, yeah, I was actually sick.
8663823	8664344	This time around.
8665204	8666185	So, thank you, Rub-a-ba.
8666789	8670392	Thank you, and thank you for saying I was right, because more people should do that, actually.
8670852	8671713	Say I was right.
8672494	8681982	No, but I mean, I think you further just proved the point, though, is that all those things you named about how it fits in the pocket, it's true.
8682322	8685064	A lot of kids play those DSs.
8686225	8689588	It'll be interesting to see how the 3DS impacts things, if at all.
8692290	8692751	But we'll see.
8693191	8695053	If they're the right games for it, they might be...
8697552	8701834	It might pick up with the other crowds that are kind of into the more hardcore stuff.
8702694	8703514	Was that it for emails?
8704535	8705215	I said there were only three.
8705235	8705435	That's it?
8705455	8705836	We're done?
8706336	8707877	Well, I wasn't listening to you, as usual.
8708377	8708997	Mailbag!
8710218	8713299	Do not make me break out Shermie's butt for you to bite.
8713960	8718462	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com She's just giving you an offended look right now.
8718802	8719082	Is she?
8719242	8719502	Yeah.
8719682	8720123	I'm looking.
8720823	8721343	Hey, girl.
8721523	8722064	How you doing?
8722324	8722724	Meow, meow.
8723803	8724464	She's like, bitch.
8726105	8727846	Wait, let me see if I can get a picture of Shermie right now.
8728127	8728407	Hold on.
8728427	8729188	Someone fill time.
8730289	8739536	I'm cropping a logo right now because apparently people don't know the concept of sending me an individual zip file with my logo's already JPEGed.
8739917	8740878	So I have to do it all myself.
8741698	8742439	No.
8742499	8743520	Actually, I have no problem doing this.
8744855	8751298	Rob is seriously taking a picture of Miss Little Fat Butt down there, looking at him all offended, sitting on her little throne.
8751578	8752339	I got a picture of it.
8752399	8756260	I'm going to totally post that on the Orange Launch Radio picture feed here.
8756481	8757501	Rob's going to totally do it.
8757581	8758001	All right, look.
8758221	8758962	Oh, my God, Rob.
8759102	8759542	Oh, my God.
8759562	8760422	I'm going to totally do it.
8760523	8762103	Okay, hold on, because we're getting that call.
8762163	8763004	I wanted to take this earlier.
8763024	8765505	This is back on the email about how do I hook up the soundboard for the 360.
8766505	8770867	So I wanted to invite SSJ100 Matt on the show to talk about this for a minute, and there's a reason why.
8770927	8771488	Matt, you there?
8772708	8773289	Oh, yes, I'm here.
8773369	8773909	How you doing, Matt?
8773929	8773969	Hi.
8775203	8797585	I'm doing good Now the reason why I invited specifically SSJ100Matt on the show is A. He's a cool guy But B. No, the reason why You might remember a couple weeks on the show And maybe you don't remember Because maybe you wouldn't have sent the email if you remembered this But I was talking about I'm just kidding Playing Perfect Dark with the folks on Under Sedation Live And it was the week that the Xbox Live had the release of Perfect Dark And I was like,
8797985	8808474	and it was like me and Alan were playing in one place and then Travis was playing and John was playing and then some of our listeners that we have in common like Matt, Misty and so forth were playing.
8808794	8818542	Well, okay, when Matt joined our game, hilarity ensued because Matt was playing these sound clips from like Duke Nukem and like, I don't know what else is in there, like probably old movies and stuff.
8818562	8819483	Ooh, ooh, did we have my favorite one?
8820023	8820243	What?
8820503	8822485	Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
8822505	8825928	Probably, probably, I don't remember but it was a hilarious epic match.
8826428	8836256	No, you know, I really didn't do anything that complicated What I got was basically something that you could just buy like in the store Hold on, you're really really quiet, can you get a little close to your microphone?
8852352	8852913	That's alright.
8853394	8853855	Ooh, much better.
8855479	8860409	Basically, what I got here is a device called the Daytel Trash Talker.
8861774	8864896	It's actually called the Trash Talker, okay, and?
8865777	8872821	And not to be confused with the knockoff version called the Smack Talker, which is crap.
8873101	8876023	Okay, so you want the trash, not the smack.
8876504	8877004	Very important.
8877044	8877224	Yes.
8878985	8885309	Basically what it is, is a little device that connects directly into your Xbox 360 controller.
8888802	8892143	It comes with software and basically in a USB cable.
8892183	8893624	It connects directly into your computer.
8893764	8899666	And basically you take sound clips, wave clips, MP3s, and just drop it into each bank.
8900686	8904928	Now it has four banks and four sets that you can use.
8906869	8911930	But, you know, it also has like a preset limit as to what you can put on there.
8911950	8916732	It doesn't say in the instructions or anything, but it will give you like a small progress bar.
8917034	8919535	You can't put long monologues and things in the buttons.
8919555	8921016	There's a limit to the space on the thing.
8921896	8928198	Yeah, you can, but you can only just take up more space on it.
8928579	8930119	Gotcha, gotcha.
8930880	8931860	I kind of want to get one of these.
8932420	8932680	I do.
8932840	8933621	I think I'm going to get one of these.
8933801	8935681	But it's a great alternative to the soundboard.
8936002	8943284	You can just dump these files from your computer right onto the trash-talking device, hit the button, and drop in sound clips left and right.
8943304	8944485	Your very own personal soundboard.
8945376	8946036	Yeah, basically.
8946136	8950238	I mean, I don't know how it sounds on other people's end, but according to you guys, it sounds really good.
8950258	8950898	It's hilarious.
8951458	8953619	It sounds just like somebody's dropping the sound file in.
8953659	8955180	I thought I was playing Duke Nukem for a minute.
8955300	8955700	It's great.
8956260	8968705	I think what I'm going to do, I'm going to get this, but instead of putting in clips from Duke Nukem and stuff, I think I'll go to the Disney Channel and get clips from That's So Raven and play those with people when I'm playing shooting matches and stuff.
8969301	8974484	But, you know, it's funny, you know, I mostly use it, like, whenever I'm playing Mom Warfare 2.
8975625	8980368	And whenever I play, like, the Duke Nukem clips, a lot of the younger kids, they don't know who Duke Nukem is.
8980388	8981208	They don't understand.
8982129	8988192	So what they think is, they think it's some 40-year-old guy who's smoked a pack of cigarettes since he was 5.
8991764	8992746	Just talking trash.
9006316	9007176	Trash Talk.
9007457	9009237	Taunt your opponents at the touch of a button.
9009517	9010698	Don't get lost for words.
9010778	9011398	Unavailable.
9011558	9011918	Bad.
9012638	9012978	Oh, really?
9013018	9014399	PlayAsia has it available.
9014899	9015239	PlayAsia.
9015279	9015839	On Amazon.
9016499	9019940	You can get it on PlayAsia, but, you know, it's a little more expensive.
9019980	9021721	I think I got it for, like, 15 bucks.
9022521	9023281	Order in bulk, though.
9023322	9024102	Just go on eBay.
9024522	9025282	I bet it's on eBay.
9025302	9026743	And warning, it's a choking hazard.
9026783	9027523	They're small parts.
9028965	9033549	Oh sure, what the hell, why don't you tell us now What's your rant on Phillips, the TV question we had earlier
9051684	9058248	Well, you know, basically, like, two years ago for my birthday, my father gave me an HDTV, Philips HDTV, for my birthday.
9058649	9068215	And it had a warranty, but after the warranty expired, the TV basically crapped out a month after the warranty ended.
9068295	9072298	So, basically, I had to call up Philips, ask them what to do.
9072338	9076000	They said, basically, it's out of warranty, we can't do anything about it.
9078782	9080443	Tough shit, have a nice life, lol.
9081104	9081424	Basically.
9081860	9091482	Yeah, pretty much, you know, they tell you to take it to a repair shop, but, you know, taking an HDTV to a repair shop, that's basically, you're going to have to buy a brand new TV.
9092202	9095643	That would irritate me, to buy a new TV and then have it break just a year later.
9096604	9103225	Yeah, but, you know, the problem was, you know, it works now, but I have to let it warm up for half an hour before I can use it.
9103805	9106606	Which is a pain in the ass, but it turned out that the problem was...
9108443	9113249	There's a short somewhere in the circuit board, which is common for some of their TVs.
9113349	9115532	I don't know if it's common with their current stuff.
9116193	9119698	I don't know, maybe they fixed the problem two years after the fact, but
9121044	9124385	I mean, that's my problem with Philips.
9125406	9126686	Alright, well, so noted.
9126746	9133289	So I will definitely take that into consideration before I spend a lot of money on a television.
9133429	9135910	But again, like I said before, what I really need to do is get the car.
9136290	9139352	So when I get the car, then I'll worry about the TV.
9139592	9141172	Because the TV I have is not bad.
9141192	9142733	But we have something for you.
9142753	9143293	Oh, go ahead.
9146553	9148194	Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
9174008	9174669	Have a good night, Matt.
9174709	9175529	You're welcome.
9175909	9176890	Thanks for letting us pick on you.
9177250	9177530	Alright.
9180431	9184133	What was it?
9184553	9186934	That clip from Heavy Rain.
9187194	9187774	Jason!
9188375	9188935	Jason!
9190435	9191136	Jason!
9193457	9196138	I remember that you used to be able to put your own voice macros in.
9197078	9200320	You know, like we did one, what are you, the poster child for abortion or something?
9200560	9200800	You know.
9202216	9204236	Jason Jason Jason Jason Jason
9233966	9240808	That'd be awesome.
9240828	9241908	These guys are filming the TV.
9241928	9242548	It's not a direct feed.
9242568	9243789	Let me see if this one's a direct feed here.
9243809	9244749	This is the last one, I promise.
9247670	9248890	Oh, fancy.
9248930	9249270	Screw you.
9249290	9250311	Got some shoes for Sean?
9250971	9252151	Can you watch Jason for a minute?
9252591	9253752	I promise, he won't be long.
9253832	9257112	Sure, no problem.
9257192	9258293	God, we don't know where this is going.
9261854	9262334	Jason!
9267264	9267745	Jason!
9271088	9271588	Jason!
9271769	9275312	There's a little X with Jason floating around, so I guess you just press X to say Jason.
9275733	9278335	Jason, you really shouldn't want to rock like that, you know?
9278936	9279757	Alright, I'm over it.
9279777	9280658	You fail at parenting.
9280858	9283180	That was a flash game, too.
9283220	9284201	Press X to Jason.
9284241	9284582	Was it?
9285363	9285803	Jason!
9287144	9287485	Loki!
9287585	9288946	Why does the door keep opening?
9289187	9289487	Loki!
9293043	9297308	Alright, let's get into the FUs of the week, because sometimes we get a little angsty on the show.
9297348	9301554	You know, when I can't find Jason, I get a little upset, so I want to do some ranting on the show.
9301614	9303316	So here we go, the FUs of the week.
9319935	9322777	FU to being pretty sick over the past few days.
9322838	9325480	I feel a lot better today, although my voice is starting to go again.
9326941	9336328	But I really, I really, not like, I enjoy the projects I'm doing, but FU to this not being my job.
9337189	9337489	You know?
9338630	9340632	To me not being able to freelance full time.
9341693	9342834	I need to be a design diva.
9344994	9347495	They need to pay me for being awesome.
9348795	9361058	If Lady Gaga can do it, so can I. If she can walk around and call herself performance art, I can put something on a piece of paper and be called a design diva.
9362518	9364138	Would you get your own show called Designing Women?
9365339	9366279	I'd be designing divas.
9367333	9374900	That show would be more interesting if it was from the perspective of, say, a grand deity like God or something.
9375140	9376101	Designing women.
9376121	9379544	It would be weird science.
9381526	9381886	Awesome.
9381946	9382407	I like that.
9383087	9389710	Anyways, F you to my weed eater, or weed whacker, I guess, for shooting fire.
9390731	9394353	Apparently it's not supposed to be doing that, so it is now broken.
9394373	9400076	It was very unfortunate that it... Weed eaters do not shoot fire, just for the record.
9400116	9401416	That's not an added benefit.
9401457	9404378	Pretty sure that there was a lot of smoke and then fire came out.
9404398	9406559	I'm like, I think this is broken.
9408800	9412002	Yeah, the engine overheated and melted down, so that's too bad.
9414719	9415480	My FU of the week.
9415861	9417163	Actually, things are pretty good right now.
9417183	9417744	I can't complain.
9417864	9419126	I don't have a lot of negative stuff going on.
9419587	9421790	I will take this opportunity to take a tangent, though.
9422491	9423713	This is actually gaming related.
9425717	9426478	Not from Sorting Glue?
9427225	9428086	No, not from Sorting Glue.
9428986	9429827	World of Warcraft.
9430667	9433129	No, I'm not giving my F you to World of Warcraft, but I am a little bit.
9434090	9436151	You might have heard this week, they put some new items on sale.
9437092	9442235	And you can get a new $10 pet called Little XT, which is one of the raid bosses later in the game.
9442275	9443676	Whatever, they've done the pet thing before.
9444176	9450881	But one of the other things they decided to sell was a Celestial Horse mount for $25.
9451481	9456965	That's right, $25 real-life dollars would buy you this mount in-game.
9457525	9458346	DarkSakura.com
9474503	9488958	and it doesn't really enhance anything you're not getting anything special that you can't like earn you know through other means or what have you it's really just the ultimate vanity item and I have to admit there was a part of me that was like oh that's kind of cool
9489474	9490695	I kind of want to get one of those.
9491135	9492356	But then I was like, but really, $25?
9494218	9499862	That's like almost half of what the new expansion is going to cost for WoW.
9499982	9501483	Cataclysm's going to cost that much money.
9502324	9505546	Well, sure enough, all these stories start popping up.
9506427	9516374	The queues on Blizzard's store just to buy My Little Magical Star Pony was like four hours long, 17,000 people deep.
9516414	9518436	You would have thought BlizzCon tickets went on sale again.
9520473	9526118	All I had to do to convince myself I don't want a magical star pony was to log into the game and go to Dalaran.
9527078	9529981	Everybody has a magical star pony.
9531122	9535965	Blizzard, this week, cooked up free money for their game.
9536266	9537186	Literally, free money.
9537747	9541530	It's a test, because you have to understand, Blizzard is owned by Activision.
9541990	9545753	Activision loves money, and Activision likes putting out map packs for $15.
9545813	9546414	Mark my words.
9549725	9551009	Mark my words.
9552168	9558934	When Blizzard puts out the item, whatever, they want to do vanity and people are whatever enough to buy it, then whatever.
9558974	9559374	And you know what?
9559434	9559995	I'm not perfect.
9560135	9561736	I bought the panda thing when it came out.
9562136	9565519	I kind of regret doing so after the fact, but I don't because it was charity.
9565920	9567841	So I'm like, okay, at least in the end it was charity.
9568202	9573006	But after I bought it, I have to admit I did have a little bit of buyer's remorse of, you know, that was kind of stupid.
9573106	9574247	Everybody has one of these pandas.
9574787	9576809	I'm not actually going to use it that much in game.
9577069	9580092	This was a stupid vanity thing, but at least it was charity.
9581869	9583430	But never again am I making that mistake.
9583790	9594713	But mark my words, the minute Blizzard releases something that does enhance your stats or does give you an enhancement or especially something you can't get through the game through other means, I quit.
9595073	9595354	Period.
9595374	9596954	I'm done with WoW when that happens.
9597234	9601476	Because as far as I'm concerned, at that point, WoW has become Farmville.
9602136	9602656	At that point.
9604062	9606643	Tell me the difference between WoW and FarmVille when that happens.
9607063	9608004	Facebook integration?
9609124	9610325	No, WoW has that now too.
9610965	9614066	You can't play WoW on Facebook, but there is an official WoW application.
9614647	9623930	So as soon as that happens, which I'm afraid is now after seeing how well this pony is done, and exactly what Loki says is in the not too distant future, I quit.
9624491	9624971	I'm done with WoW.
9626792	9633614	because it's kind of insane in some ways that Blizzard probably sold easy a half million of these.
9634255	9637036	Blizzard made a million dollars.
9637076	9637656	No, more than that.
9637716	9639917	Blizzard probably made $10 million this week.
9641017	9641777	Right?
9641797	9643658	25 times half a million would be about what?
9643838	9644378	$12.5 million, right?
9644438	9645019	What will you play?
9646359	9646739	I don't know.
9646799	9647299	Something else.
9647319	9648260	Play Star Trek Online with me.
9648460	9649720	Final Fantasy XIV for one.
9650020	9650321	We'll see.
9650461	9652521	I don't know if Star Trek Online does the same thing.
9652921	9654242	No MMO am I going to do that with.
9655427	9657369	What Star Trek Online does, I'll tell you.
9657689	9659751	And I actually like this with the cryptic store.
9659991	9660932	You buy points.
9661893	9663595	And you've got them for whatever you want them for.
9664796	9675686	What I bought was... I actually bought the ability to play a Klingon on the Federation side, play a Ferengi, because they've each got their own bonuses, their own special abilities.
9676247	9679130	Because this might be something that I want, and I'm kind of a weird completionist.
9679690	9679890	But...
9680871	9681491	I liked that.
9682112	9686434	I liked that you could pay to respec.
9687054	9689975	If you've completely foobarred everything, you could pay to respec.
9691056	9693096	And it's not even a lot of points.
9693637	9698999	I've only spent $20 in buying points, and I still have some left, and I've gotten all this stuff.
9699079	9700039	They make it affordable.
9700800	9700980	So...
9702932	9707277	Alright, I gotta give some comments in chat because there's way too good comments here in chat.
9708198	9713243	SalaciousPop says, everyone has one, so whatever little originality your tune had just got lessened.
9713303	9713703	That's true.
9714424	9718268	Chad28 says, cough, I bought it, cough, but I'm super addicted to Mount Horror.
9719570	9722613	My question is though, do you have buyer's remorse now that you see that everyone has one?
9722633	9724555	I like the design of it though, I will have to say that.
9724855	9725997	It's a pretty mount.
9726137	9727018	I will say that.
9727098	9729662	But when I saw everybody had one, I was like, okay, whatever.
9730182	9731464	I would rather work and get that.
9731784	9734228	The Raven mount is so fucking epic.
9734268	9735309	It's the best mount in the game.
9735590	9736711	But it's a bitch to get.
9736731	9739154	I didn't buy it, though.
9739174	9742218	Did you see the link in the chat where they made $2 million in four hours?
9742799	9743180	God.
9744061	9744822	I'm not surprised.
9745543	9749287	I do have to, though, give them props for actually having a very unique design.
9749547	9751670	I mean, I haven't seen anything done like this.
9751890	9755995	Legend of Zaku makes an excellent point, and you thought paying for horse armor was bad enough.
9756476	9760400	If you had a problem with horse armor in Oblivion and you bought this, um... Um...
9766774	9767214	Just saying.
9768335	9768795	Let's see.
9771637	9772017	Let's see.
9772077	9772738	I'm looking here.
9774859	9775400	Other chat rooms.
9775440	9777481	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to look.
9779082	9779623	Let's see.
9781377	9804707	SJ100 Matt says NHL 10 started letting you download additional stats to your creative player for blank XBL space bucks you can unlock those bonus stats in game but they were a real pain in the ass to obtain so a lot of people just bought the stats you know Gyromancer has something like that too but I don't know I somewhat give Gyromancer a pass because it's not a multiplayer game really I mean I guess it does have multiplayer mode but it's more of a single like player puzzle game I don't know it just seems different
9804887	9808449	And by the way, horse armor does actually make sense if your horse is part of your battle stat.
9810030	9814552	Chad28 says, there's also a rumor going around that they're going to charge 20 bucks a month when Cataclysm comes out.
9814632	9815933	Even I will leave if that happens.
9816693	9819194	Shaoran in chat says, it doesn't matter if Rob's done with WoW.
9819434	9822616	He'll be sucking MMO cock again the second Final Fantasy XIV comes again.
9822836	9823236	That's true.
9823597	9824037	True statement.
9825297	9827138	And Ziba gave Loki that link earlier.
9827158	9827579	So there you go.
9827639	9829359	Rama says, Sky, I'm going to hold you to that.
9829860	9830280	Go for it.
9831901	9832241	There you go.
9834525	9835265	Lots of chat comments.
9835305	9837366	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join in.
9837867	9838447	Anyhow, sorry.
9838487	9841108	That was actually my FU of the week that kind of turned into a story of its own.
9841528	9843149	But that happens here on the show sometimes.
9843429	9848211	We have a couple more actual stories for you guys and then we're going to get into the calls of the week.
9848231	9851833	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9852353	9854954	Just one minute though, don't start calling yet because we've got a couple more stories.
9854994	9855234	Loki.
9856415	9862018	Apparently the 3D games are going to be coming to the PlayStation Network very soon.
9863018	9866680	Of course you've probably seen commercials and stuff for 3D TVs on TV.
9869702	9871724	Um, including some from Samsung.
9891265	9908536	and they include Wipeout HD, MotorStorm Pacific Rift, Pain, Super Stardust HD and I guess those will all be available on the PlayStation Network at the same time.
9908816	9911858	Now granted though, these aren't all 3D.
9911918	9913719	It's kind of like portions of them.
9913739	9916001	Like Wipeout HD is actually supposed to be in full 3D.
9916701	9920543	Motorstorm Pacific Rift is supposed to have a level that's in 3D.
9920583	9922324	Pain has, I believe, three levels.
9922764	9927387	Not positive about Super Stardust HD, but it's kind of like...
9929415	9957030	I don't know, a little proof of concept games I guess Toagak in our chatroom says 3D is fucking overkill out the wazoo, you know I kind of agree I don't know, I don't know, then again maybe if I play it I'll change my mind but I already kind of said this earlier in the show I just, I don't know how I feel about everything shifting towards 3D quite rapidly might I add, like it's not just happening like slowly, it's happening fast it feels like, 3D's taking over fast, thank you Avatar
9959969	9960089	Me.
9960770	9961230	Just saying.
9962111	9965054	By the way, did you know Avatar's out on Blu-ray, what, the 22nd?
9965134	9965535	Earth Day.
9965555	9966896	Oh, is it Earth Day, really?
9966916	9967116	But.
9967677	9968418	But, what, yeah?
9969138	9970940	It's just the movie with none of the goodies.
9970980	9971681	You wait till November.
9972622	9973002	Interesting.
9973083	9975085	To get the Blu-ray that comes with all of the goodies.
9976666	9978949	This is more like, okay, here's your bone.
9979669	9982192	Well, I love the fact that they're marketing it with
9982915	9984115	Go Back to the World
10008004	10008984	Are you going to pick up Avatar?
10009744	10010605	Or you're going to wait, aren't you?
10010625	10011065	I'm going to wait.
10012365	10014105	I want the extra stuff, so I don't care.
10014125	10014485	I'll wait.
10015645	10016146	You'll be patient?
10016166	10017446	I've got Avatar.
10017546	10019226	I mean, I like the movie.
10019246	10019886	I thought it was great.
10021787	10022547	I see what you did there.
10023887	10024147	All right.
10025807	10028888	Let's get into one more story here, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
10029948	10033729	Oh, this is a very fitting last story of the day here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10037745	10038725	Where do I even go with this?
10040786	10041666	So there's this woman.
10043247	10044467	And she's from Manchester.
10045728	10047548	And she's talking Wii Fit this week.
10048429	10052990	And the reason why she's talking Wii Fit, she's blaming it because it turned her into a sex addict.
10054131	10056491	Yes, Wii Fit made me a sex addict on the next Oprah.
10057612	10060633	This 24-year-old, her name is Amanda Flowers.
10060693	10064494	I have to say, honestly, is this for real?
10064514	10066495	Because isn't there a porn star named Amanda Flowers?
10068524	10069525	If not, there ought to be.
10069765	10071086	It sounds like a very porn star name.
10071106	10072547	It sounds like a porny name, doesn't it?
10073907	10074188	I don't know.
10074208	10074508	We'll see.
10074528	10076049	Deflowered, number 50.
10077830	10078110	All right.
10078390	10078870	Well, anyhow.
10079631	10087775	Okay, so yeah, she fell off the balance board, and she claims that because of the stumble, she is now a sex addict.
10088235	10089996	She wants sex 10 times a day.
10090657	10092518	The slightest vibration in the air...
10095180	10115998	she says it begins as a twinge down below before surging through my body sometimes it built up into a trembling orgasm with no cure I just have to try to control my passion by breathing deeply hopefully one day I'll find a super stud who can satisfy me and I'm thinking here I'm like is this a fucking joke like is April Fool's still happening does someone not get the memo that April Fool's is supposed to be stuck to April 1st
10117059	10118280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10140495	10144338	I was like, and just listening to this just makes me think of that episode.
10145399	10147481	I'm like, did she hit her head?
10149502	10150883	Did she fall on her cooch or something?
10150943	10154326	No, there is actually, it's a real... Did she hit herself in the labia?
10154466	10154987	I mean, what?
10155167	10156288	It's a real syndrome.
10156328	10158389	It's a persistent sexual arousal syndrome.
10159270	10161072	From falling off the Wii balance board?
10161212	10166136	I mean, I guess... I hate to bring back up that episode, but it was a head trauma that did it for the episode.
10166176	10166556	I don't know.
10166576	10168718	They picked things that are kind of far-fetched.
10169138	10169358	Hmm.
10171468	10172729	Let's see here.
10173289	10174050	Are you on the wiki?
10174710	10180253	No, I'm on the Boston University School of Medicine's sexual medicine, apparently.
10180313	10183695	Their sub page here.
10185416	10188418	Let's see.
10188438	10190219	It doesn't really say what the causes are.
10196142	10196882	Okay, whatever.
10197022	10198383	So it's a real thing.
10198483	10198683	I mean...
10200905	10202206	Head trauma and sex drive.
10202386	10206510	I'm immediately going to go home and fall off my Wii Fit board as many times as possible.
10207231	10212695	Head trauma and sex drive are connected since a person suffering from brain injury usually has a reduced sex drive.
10213576	10213997	Yeah, whatever.
10215078	10218861	Frisbee says in chat, if hitting your head makes you a sex addict, how is this Nintendo's fault?
10218881	10222384	You know, part of me wants to say this story really has nothing to do with Wii Fit.
10222404	10222985	Wait a second.
10223265	10224546	You know what this reminds me of?
10224606	10226768	And oh my God, I can't believe I'm thinking about this now.
10226788	10227729	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
10228509	10239874	What was that one movie that had, oh my god now, the guy that did Hairspray, John Waters, remember that John Waters movie where everyone was like a sexual deviant or whatever?
10240034	10247217	Desperate Living, and they get exiled to the town of Mortville, it's really disgusting, like it's the most disgusting movie ever made, is that what it is?
10247997	10270913	um I don't think it was that one but she like they were trying to figure out a new sex act or whatever oh oh uh uh you're trying it's a newer one it's um uh damn it it's the one I know what you're talking about they had that one girl and she had ginormous tits and Tracy Ullman was in it um I know what you're talking about it'll come a desperate no desperate living I already said
10272315	10274637	Somebody in chat will get, thank you, Lowdown Dirty Shame.
10274858	10275959	Yes, Lowdown Dirty Shame.
10276439	10277240	No, it's not.
10277621	10279243	Lowdown Dirty Shame was another movie.
10279363	10280744	Dirty Shame is the name of it.
10280865	10281786	It's Dirty Shame.
10282406	10292358	Anyways, it's like that because that was their kind of sex act that she would cause some sort of head trauma and then she became like a sex deviant.
10295625	10296505	That's right!
10296565	10298166	That was the whole point of that movie, huh?
10298206	10300787	Tracy Ullman gets in a car accident and then suddenly she's a sex addict.
10300807	10301828	Yes, a dirty shame.
10302648	10303069	Wow.
10304229	10308471	Well, I guess it's a dirty shame she fell off her Wii Fit board, huh?
10311253	10315115	Like I said, I'm going to go home and probably try to fall off my board as many times as possible.
10318092	10330996	Alright, Skype line is now open 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio The phones are open for business while we wait for some calls, last minute stories Anyone?
10331936	10345961	Gunblade is coming to the Wii They're going to do Gunblade New York and LA Machine Guns packed together kind of like what they did with House of the Dead 2 and 3 That makes me happy because I used to play the crap out of Gunblade at QZAR
10348038	10348898	I don't remember Gunblade.
10349399	10355282	They have like these giant machine guns that you would shoot stuff with and they would just constantly rumble as you're playing the game.
10355962	10356922	Alright, to the phones!
10357743	10358743	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10358763	10359103	Who's this?
10360604	10362065	Hi, this is Spazinator.
10362245	10364546	Hey, Spazinator, what is on your mind, my friend?
10366467	10369949	Yeah, you know, two things.
10371489	10376532	Before I get to that, I just want to say, with the live story you read off, I can just see
10377128	10383053	Every guy in America going out to store right now to buy Wii Fit for their girlfriend.
10383193	10387557	Actually, yeah, I was going to say, I thought you were going to say guys are going to run out and buy it.
10388398	10395924	Actually, most, and obviously I was joking earlier when I was talking about I'm going to go fall off the thing, but I think most guys already are sex addicts.
10396244	10404931	It's just that they're going to get this game for their girlfriends or wives and so forth and then spray Pam all over the Wii Fit board.
10405712	10407153	Or they don't even have to do that.
10407213	10409715	I mean, obviously it's just some hard surface or something.
10410075	10412917	And I want to know how she fell off the Wii Fit board.
10413137	10416619	All right, anyhow, I'm sorry, Spaz.
10416639	10419260	That's probably not why you were calling in tonight, but what's up?
10421482	10429707	Yeah, I was wondering, have you checked out the Flower soundtrack yet?
10432318	10438905	No, I think I do remember reading a story that it was available, but Flower had a great ambient soundtrack.
10440026	10447013	Remember how we had the story earlier tonight about the study about Modern Warfare 2 versus March of the Penguins and which one would make you fall asleep?
10447994	10450396	The Flower soundtrack would be a great thing to fall asleep to.
10450456	10452218	It's very nice ambient music.
10452258	10453259	Is that available to get now?
10454947	10459510	Yeah, in fact, it's been out for roughly a week and a half now.
10459730	10468876	In fact, just this past Friday, I ended up picking it up just for the hell of it, and it's pretty good.
10469637	10481945	Yeah, in fact, as you were kind of touching on there, ever since I got it, I've been using it to fall asleep to whenever I get a bad case of insomnia, so...
10482563	10507522	Which is pretty much on a regular basis Flower, by the way, is one of the best racing games I've played in the past year Yes, I consider it a racing game It plays like a racing game to me Play it for yourself, find out But I think it's a great support Oh my gosh, it's a beautiful game Just such a beautiful game You know, there was some controversy I guess Ebert spoke up again about another whole games as art controversy He came up again, he said Games are not art and they're never going to be art
10507962	10514503	It's funny because every blog story I see reporting on the news issue has got a picture of Flower to go with it.
10514583	10516684	It's kind of like the, oh, games can't be art, eh?
10517704	10518524	I wonder if there'll be a Flower 2.
10518844	10519144	We'll see.
10522605	10531927	Well, we'll probably get a Flower 2 or something similar pretty soon since all of these have been doing well.
10531987	10534347	Flower, Flow, so on and so forth.
10534647	10535368	I wouldn't doubt it.
10536508	10536788	Now,
10538518	10556182	Also, as per my usual day, I usually do every so often, there's one show that I discovered that I think you guys may like, especially one of our fellow listeners, DJ Ranma S. What's that?
10557602	10559083	It's called Toko.
10560243	10560403	It's...
10561698	10574947	It's a 12 episode anime series that's been out on cable TV and it's also available on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
10575167	10578269	It's kind of hard to describe.
10578329	10583472	It's kind of like a cross between The X-Files and Devil May Cry.
10584890	10585451	Interesting.
10587052	10604869	Yeah, it's, well, I've only seen the first four episodes so far, and based on, it's really kind of the same, what the whole series is like, but just based on what level I've seen so far, it seems pretty good.
10609113	10620040	There are a few racier moments in there that wouldn't necessarily be great for the younger crowd, but if you're old enough to handle that kind of thing, it's pretty good.
10620300	10621861	For us mature folks who can handle it.
10622182	10624323	All right, well, Spazinator, we'll have to check that out.
10624363	10625324	But for now, I'm going to let you go.
10625424	10627985	But thanks for the chat and lots of different topics tonight.
10628165	10629006	And you have a good week, okay?
10630649	10631129	Yep, you too.
10631149	10631529	Take care.
10631569	10631990	Alright, later.
10632770	10642614	By the way, a comment from our chat room from Seg wants to point out that.game.company, the people who make Flower, they don't do sequels, but they don't fail to make something new and beautiful.
10642694	10643155	And you know what?
10643435	10644415	I'm totally okay with that.
10644455	10644775	You know what?
10644795	10654340	Flower doesn't need a sequel necessarily, but it would be awesome if there was another game kind of in that same vein, just that very relaxing, beautiful...
10655441	10658706	All this talk about sex makes me want to just sit here and play a couple of age games.
10669795	10671476	Well, hello, DJ Ranma S. How are you?
10672416	10673337	Hey, I'm fine.
10674277	10677219	Spazinator was talking about a show he was recommending, Toko.
10677239	10677799	Have you heard of that?
10679120	10680341	No, I have not.
10680361	10681381	You might have to ask him about it.
10681421	10685824	He specifically said it was for you and us, but he said you might get a kick out of it.
10685844	10686424	Check it out.
10686724	10687124	You never know.
10687925	10692627	Well, I'm already working on a couple of anime titles right now, but that's not why I called.
10692908	10693468	All right.
10693488	10694308	Why did you call?
10694669	10696330	Surely you didn't call to talk about Wii Fit.
10696390	10696970	What's on your mind?
10699295	10706399	Do you remember a couple of years ago you guys talked about a Spanish DDR movie called La Machina de Bahia?
10707479	10709380	Yes, sadly enough, I do remember that.
10711001	10713342	Me and my friend Jerry watched it Friday night.
10713983	10714283	Really?
10715063	10715263	Yes.
10715664	10719085	Okay, so it's a Spanish movie about Dance Dance Revolution, basically, right?
10719726	10720466	Not really.
10720566	10725889	It's the campiest feel-good movie of the year, really.
10726845	10728886	of the two years ago, because the movie's been out a while.
10729826	10730386	Pretty much.
10730987	10737609	Alright, I have to ask, A, what possessed you to, of all things, watch La Magina de Balar, or whatever it's called?
10738490	10752755	It was sitting on my computer for about a year and a half, and my roommate was playing FF13, and getting him off the 360 is like getting the jaws of life, so I'm like, you know what, we might as well just watch the movie, and it was like, wow.
10754275	10754455	And?
10754916	10755476	Was it good?
10756306	10757187	It was pretty good.
10757207	10758348	I thought it was funny.
10758709	10763855	The plot of the movie is about this kid who loves playing DDR, works in a supermarket.
10764255	10768720	His boss asks him to watch his pet snake.
10769140	10770202	So he's like, yeah, sure.
10770582	10773926	His friends find out that he has this place to himself.
10773946	10776168	They bring chicks over and...
10777037	10777557	and DarkSakura.com
10805154	10808156	So it's kind of like The Wizard, right?
10808776	10812218	Weren't they entering the tournament to raise money to run away from home?
10812238	10812738	What were they doing?
10812758	10813159	I don't remember.
10813539	10815700	They were trying to raise money for something, and he entered the tournament.
10816961	10817201	Right?
10817861	10818101	Yes.
10818862	10819142	I see.
10821043	10824605	So it was basically The Wizard in Spanish, but with less Power Glove and more snakes.
10825866	10827227	And a lot more butterfly.
10828628	10829168	Goody, goody.
10830580	10836905	Alright, so thumbs up or thumbs down to, let me make sure I get this right, La Magina de Bailar.
10837605	10837965	Bailar.
10838005	10842228	That's how it is, and yes, I'd give it two thumbs up.
10842248	10842749	Bailar.
10844310	10844530	Sorry.
10845855	10847937	I give it two thumbs up with alcohol.
10849558	10850719	It's funny sober.
10850959	10858545	It's hilarious drunk because for some reason when I'm watching the movie, I have this tendency to point out indifferences.
10859266	10862168	In the movie, I'm pointing out, this is from DDR USA.
10862388	10863309	This is from Xtreme 2.
10863369	10864710	This is from Max.
10864770	10866171	I'm looking at the different screens.
10866191	10867933	I'm like, this is from this one and this is that one.
10868013	10870495	Ranma, it's because you're a nerd.
10871035	10872056	I'm just saying.
10872336	10873256	Damn right I am.
10874177	10875178	You're a fucking nerd.
10875218	10877759	And I love you for it, but you're a nerd.
10877920	10880601	I mean, you're not supposed to do that with nerd movies.
10882483	10884424	It's called the suspension of belief.
10886525	10891729	Well, maybe because it was so campy, my eyes just started looking at all the other stuff, you know?
10892049	10892169	Mm-hmm.
10893695	10895336	A true DDR nerd till you die.
10895676	10896477	I can respect that.
10898458	10902400	Anything else you want to talk about tonight that isn't about DDR and snakes?
10903320	10906902	Before I hang up, I want this heard.
10908343	10909183	I'm holding you to that.
10910484	10910664	What?
10910684	10911044	About WoW.
10913210	10914591	Okay, but I want to make it clear.
10914751	10916272	I want to make it very, very clear.
10916953	10924339	They need to put something out for sale that is basically a way to cheat.
10924679	10931225	I should say that the item sale would give somebody a clear advantage just by spending money for it.
10931485	10954027	because obviously you can already pay for faction transfers, you can pay for server transfers that's fine and dandy, I don't have a problem with that I don't have a problem with vanity items I'm going to have a problem when the item that you spend hours and hours to grind and get and raid for that gives you the bonus stats to intellect or whatever is suddenly available for $15 through Blizzard's website that is where I draw the line
10954989	10955289	Okay.
10955589	10962878	Alright, I just want to make it very clear, because I know how the listeners are, and every single item that comes out, they're going to say, oh, does Rob have to delete WoW now?
10963939	10967283	That's why I wanted you to say it, so everyone's all clear about it.
10967483	10973110	I don't care how many magical star ponies they put out, and you know what, if they put out a pink pony, I might have to do it.
10975273	10976174	I'm kidding, I'm not going to do it.
10976755	10979417	It depends on the price.
10979457	10980518	If it's $5, maybe.
10980538	10982660	But $25, Ranma, that's the other problem.
10982881	10984823	There's a big difference between $10 and $25.
10985784	10990308	Like $25 is like the price of a used game.
10991729	10993011	This just proves that people are sheep.
10994656	11017961	and I have friends that bought it and I feel bad saying this you know and even a friend a really good friend wanted to gift it to me and I'm like no please don't you don't you really no really you really really don't have to do that like I would like go buy yourself a bottle of vodka and a porno and have yourself a wonderful evening like I would rather you do that than buy me the star pony
11020987	11042061	Alright, anyhow Ranma, we gotta let you go, try to get some more calls But thank you so much No problem Bye As Actdeft points out, yes, it is a big difference It sure is a big difference I hate this Skype spam, look at this Wait, this Skype spam I got European and American women are too arrogant for you
11042762	11044083	Well, I know of one.
11044703	11049846	Are you looking for a sweet lady that will be caring and understanding?
11050366	11051427	Then you came to the right place.
11051727	11052767	I didn't come to you, bitch.
11052827	11054048	You're sending me a spam message.
11055048	11055349	Let's see.
11055409	11058370	Here you can find a Russian lady that will love you with all of her heart.
11059131	11060651	Can't find a queen to rule your heart?
11060691	11061892	How about beautiful Russian ladies?
11061912	11062672	I'm going to tell you right now.
11065334	11067355	Not all Russian women are sweet.
11067555	11069717	I want to point out, Loki married a Russian woman.
11070397	11072939	Not the kind that's being advertised here, just so you know.
11073739	11073940	No.
11074200	11074820	Big difference.
11075060	11075641	Big difference.
11076901	11078162	Nelly's an independent woman.
11082485	11083266	One more call.
11083326	11084586	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11084627	11085047	Who's this?
11087732	11088572	Zaku!
11088712	11090053	What is on your mind, my friend?
11090073	11093574	Wait, but you're working, that's good, because I remember...
11104199	11109281	Yeah, I remember a time you were calling into the show and you were like, I'm unemployed, I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to do this.
11110722	11112322	But then you found a job, so all's better.
11112362	11113583	Well, I know how you are.
11113643	11116224	We all get a case of the Mondays, you know, no matter what.
11116684	11117485	It happens, it happens.
11117565	11121946	Even the people that are job hunting kind of go, oh, God, I hope this is the week.
11122307	11123827	You know, I know how it goes.
11124507	11125648	So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
11126773	11130317	Um, Activision's bullshit, that's what's on my mind tonight.
11130497	11133199	Is it the Star Pony bullshit, or is it Infinity Ward bullshit?
11133220	11141888	No, it's basically their executive trying to do their best to put lipstick on a pig regarding the whole Infinity Ward situation.
11142734	11147455	in particular, how he's defending that they get compensated better in Activision.
11148096	11148736	Hold on, hold on.
11149756	11156038	I'm sorry, when you said lipstick on a pig, I immediately went to that whole Sarah Palin thing.
11156978	11160139	I don't know why.
11160219	11162360	My mind just went to Sarah Palin.
11162760	11163961	I'm not calling her a name.
11164141	11165841	She said something about lipstick on a pitbull.
11166301	11167702	That's where my mind went.
11168522	11171543	The idea is that Activision is trying to whitewash something
11172908	11200548	basically their years of trying to milk the proverbial golden calf that was Infinity Ward when you milk somebody to the point of to the point of when you saturate the market and everything else because that's all it is, it's mediocrity it's a race to the bottom unfortunately and in this case Activision tries, they basically try to, they're running a slave ship in terms of
11201055	11208883	you know, not only Infinity Ward but other studios that have to churn out a new Call of Duty game every single year quality be damned
11210658	11233352	at the same time though Activision their their point in life or whatever is to make money and there's investors that are expecting that hold on investors expecting them to make money and return on investment etc etc blah blah blah so you know in all these people are quitting left and right in I believe Activision is based in California which would be an at-will employment state or wherever they are obviously they're not signed to contracts because they are quitting left and right
11233932	11261853	what else can Activision do but come out and say well don't worry everything's going to be okay even though they might be pooping their pants behind the scenes because they have investors to make happy at the end of the day and they're going to say of course this will be a great game oh these people are just going to be better off where they're at and we're much better because of it and then behind the curtain they're like oh my god what are we going to do alright one thing is basically having to meet the demands of their investors and as a public company they have to but that's only short term
11262731	11266714	What they should be focusing on is long term returns.
11266774	11273118	Basically long term return on investment which is really hard to do because you need to be more original.
11274096	11278719	in terms of finding new ideas that would stretch out even further.
11279119	11281420	Making another multi-million dollar franchise.
11281480	11283341	It's not just milking the current ones you have.
11283922	11291206	And this is the problem with not only the business world in particular, but Activision and the fact that they're so short-sighted.
11291746	11299330	EA basically woke up from that nightmare a few years back and actually started making more original properties.
11299911	11300851	More original games.
11301572	11302332	And as a result,
11302742	11310365	They're still a publicly traded company, but they have a lot more in their portfolio in terms of actually franchises.
11310885	11316227	And they don't basically milk them every... They don't have to meet the 10-month deadline for new games.
11317688	11320028	So maybe this will just come full circle, Zaku?
11320128	11321209	I mean, you said it yourself.
11321449	11328111	Yeah, I'm thinking Activision has to eventually reach a point where their mediocrity is going to bite them in the ass.
11328672	11329512	And that's a fact.
11329572	11330392	That day is coming.
11330993	11331833	The day will have...
11332642	11346267	The day will come when people just realize that they're getting raped, they're getting hoodwinked every single year with the same bullshit, with the same game that offers very little in terms of fresh new content.
11346807	11349868	I am really curious to see what happens this year, Zaku.
11349908	11361311	Being the music game fan, and I know you're in this boat too, I'm very curious to see what happens at the end of the year with Guitar Hero 6 or whatever they end up putting out, because you know it's going to happen, versus Rock Band 3.
11362552	11373295	Because especially when you take into light this whole lawsuit and all this other business going on right now, I'm very curious to see how the... And I guess it's come out that Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero and all that didn't sell too hot.
11373856	11380677	of course I'm really curious to see if Rock Band kicks it down or what happens
11381351	11388775	I mean, the reason, you have to give it to Harmonix, that they actually took something that has never been marketed that well, like the Beatles catalog.
11389555	11391817	And they actually made a boatload of money as a result.
11392517	11395839	I know it was a license, but still, that was a major license.
11395939	11399001	Well, here's the first thing that they've done right so far this year.
11399541	11407765	It's been almost four months now, and we haven't had a guitar release yet this year, so... Well, that makes sense.
11407825	11410987	That and the fact that Harmonix is not like
11411949	11415672	Not like trying to claw their way to get another Rock Band version out next year.
11416172	11424059	It's been almost, what, more than a year since we had Rock Band 2, and all they're doing is just shoveling new content.
11424499	11434347	Which is good, because it's better to have people continue buying the current version and then just focusing on delivering more DLC.
11434787	11438170	Because that's really the heart of the game, the music.
11441070	11447975	Alright, well, Zaku buddy, we're going to let you go, but some good thoughts on that, and we'll see what happens.
11448736	11454199	I think you're right, I think the cycle will come full circle, and somebody else will be the big bad evil dude next year.
11454940	11465848	At least the folks of Infinity Ward broke out when they had the chance, and so now that they're back in TGA, at least this time, they're not going to get screwed over and be whipped to...
11466808	11473390	to chunk out, you know, to turn out Call of Duty games or any new IP that they have every annual.
11474551	11474871	All right.
11474951	11476551	Well, we will see what happens.
11476931	11479692	All right, Zaku, we're going to let you go, buddy, but you have a good one.
11480553	11481013	Have a good one.
11481293	11481533	Later.
11482711	11484432	Alright, I think that's going to do it for the Skype calls tonight.
11484492	11485953	And somebody in chat making a very good point.
11485993	11488754	Did you notice that every New York listener got in tonight?
11489475	11490035	Isn't that weird?
11490896	11496459	Like, I guess technically Spazinator is in New York City, but he's in Buffalo, which is still upstate New York.
11496619	11499700	So tonight was a very New York state of mind in many ways.
11499881	11503823	So I don't know what you New Yorkers are doing with your phones, but y'all got in.
11503863	11505103	Even SSJ100Matt, we called him.
11505143	11505744	He's in New York too.
11506344	11506785	Go figure.
11507105	11508607	I think they just really want me to come visit.
11508807	11509588	That's what you want, right?
11510268	11511329	I really want to go back to New York.
11511469	11511890	I really do.
11512671	11513011	We'll see.
11513071	11513552	Hopefully soon.
11513592	11515333	My friend doesn't live there anymore, so I have to go.
11515714	11517015	I'll have to crash at Ranma's house.
11519558	11520659	We'll see if he likes that.
11521039	11521540	Alright, anyhow.
11522701	11526985	We are going to start to wrap up here because it's about 9.30 here on the West Coast.
11527065	11529207	It's been kind of a long show night, at least three hours if not more.
11529287	11532810	So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight and be on our way out of here for the night.
11533911	11536893	So let's go around and make sure there's no more last minute stories.
11536934	11538495	I don't know if Loki has anything else he wants to state.
11539065	11539105	3DS?
11539125	11539225	3DS?
11556757	11557938	Well, who knows.
11558198	11566222	Apparently there was a trademark registered by Konami Digital Entertainment for something with the title of Harmony of Despair.
11566662	11569863	If that doesn't sound like a Castlevania title, I don't know what is.
11569884	11571664	Yeah, it sounds pretty Castlevania to me.
11572845	11577167	Apparently Jam with the Band on the DS is coming to Europe.
11578187	11582510	That game was originally only released in... Didn't that come out like two years ago?
11583750	11584511	In Japan, yeah.
11584952	11585293	Oh, wow.
11585453	11585713	Okay.
11585753	11590860	Yeah, it's never been released over here or in Europe, so they're going to be getting that.
11591301	11593945	And with a bunch of new songs, I guess.
11596618	11606564	A bunch of covers like ABC, Chariots of Fighter, I'm a Slave for You, Material Girl, among other things.
11607625	11620472	And of course some Nintendo original songs including an F-Zero medley, NES Classics medley, Legend of Zelda medley, Super Mario Kart medley, Super Mario medley, and Onigashima medley.
11620693	11623794	I gotta be honest, a lot of this sounds pretty good.
11625435	11627095	And let's see here.
11628116	11641278	Nintendo has actually won an appeal against Anescape in their suit saying that they had a patent for, I guess, the Wave Bird and the classic controllers and whatnot.
11643198	11644219	So that's kind of cool.
11644699	11648419	Unfortunately, they have been sued again by somebody else.
11648639	11651580	Now, IA Labs...
11652040	11666455	apparently is going to be suing them because of a fitness game, Power Grid Fitness, I guess, has... They're saying that it infringes on their patent for it.
11668176	11672801	And apparently they said that they also approached Nintendo with the idea in the first place, so...
11674124	11676465	Crazy Taxi Quake Arena Arcade What? !
11700619	11705996	Quake Arena Arcade Yes That was already announced, I think, a while ago On Xbox?
11706417	11710858	Yeah, it's going to have 16 player online battles with 40 original maps.
11710998	11712458	Get your trash talker ready, Matt.
11714559	11719200	Some other titles, of course, on the way that apparently are appearing on PartnerNet as well.
11719600	11732683	Metal Slug XX, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, Raystorm HD, Sonic Adventure DX, The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match, Quake Arena Arcade,
11733763	11738265	Crazy Taxi, Bali, Card Game, and Doom 2, the arcade version.
11739626	11740667	Doom 2 arcade version.
11741367	11746170	And the first five of those titles, if you know where to look, have already been leaked out.
11751613	11752093	All right.
11753093	11753674	Very cool.
11754974	11755895	Lots of good stuff in there.
11756158	11757598	That's it for Last Minute Stories, then, Loki?
11758178	11758979	That's it.
11758999	11760359	We've had a really full show tonight.
11760399	11761879	I'm really out of stuff, too.
11762339	11762599	All right.
11762719	11763699	That's why I'm sitting on the floor again.
11763719	11763919	I know.
11763939	11767400	Well, I noticed you're working on your decoupage, so I figured you had to be out of things.
11767480	11770200	Are you going to take a status picture for our chatters to see?
11770481	11772101	I am, once I actually have something worth status.
11772141	11776062	I'm actually doing extra layers of glue on the back to hold down these loose ends.
11777722	11780942	But I'll tell you, there's Xbox stuff I'm excited about coming out.
11781142	11781903	What's that?
11781923	11782903	I want to play No More Heroes.
11783563	11784163	Ah, very nice.
11785089	11788171	I see your Dicapage pictures are already up on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
11788191	11788531	Very nice.
11789512	11789772	Very nice.
11789792	11793855	They've replaced the pictures of Matt with the double down last week, which is good because I was sick of looking at that thing.
11793915	11796197	Or me with the nose pond.
11796237	11797497	Yeah, you with the nose pond.
11797517	11800840	That was really bad but funny from that episode.
11801540	11802781	Oh, that was the week Loki missed.
11802921	11803301	Oh, boy.
11803641	11806343	You should be very glad you had family things to tend to that night.
11806503	11807024	What happened?
11807044	11807744	All right.
11809265	11815989	DarkSakura had this thing in her nose that she used for her sinus things and it looked like she was shoving a tampon in her nose.
11816369	11818590	And so we were calling it a nose pond.
11818690	11819791	It's the Vicks inhaler.
11819971	11822592	I dared her to take a picture and put it on the website and she did it.
11822852	11823693	I looked crazy.
11823713	11827255	You know that Jamie doesn't like pictures of her.
11827275	11829376	She's very picky choosy about what she lets out on the internet.
11829396	11832217	She's like, I'll take one because I know I look shitty today.
11835097	11837398	I like glue Loki, your final thought for our listeners tonight
11852833	11855253	Why is Ranma coming to Sacramento and going to kidnap Ron?
11855714	11856514	Uh-oh.
11856714	11858694	He's coming to stay with me.
11858714	11859314	When is he coming?
11859354	11860194	I need to make sure I'm available.
11860214	11860935	For explosions.
11860995	11861775	Is Patty coming too?
11861915	11862235	Yes.
11862535	11863235	Oh, 4th of July, right?
11863335	11863515	Yes.
11863635	11865455	Okay, then I will make sure I'm available.
11865495	11866656	Explosion day!
11866676	11867756	That's what we should rename it.
11867776	11870396	Are they going to be here for Pride the week before?
11870416	11870456	No.
11871236	11872937	Guys, you need to rearrange your schedule and get here the week before.
11873057	11873457	That's Pride.
11873897	11876977	Rob, you need to take me because I haven't been to a function yet.
11877858	11878238	It'll be fun.
11878298	11879558	All I've been is to the street fair.
11880038	11882459	It's on my birthday this year, though, so I don't know how I feel about that.
11882499	11883339	I'll have to get you dinner.
11883459	11883739	We'll see.
11884279	11885279	All right, anyhow, we're done.
11885319	11885859	We're out.
11885919	11892961	My final thought is, I don't know, I just ate a whole bag of cinnamon sugar pita chips during the show because I'm fat, huh?
11893381	11894481	All right, that's it.
11894581	11895201	We're out of here.
11895261	11901182	Thank you guys so much for listening to our show, downloading, listening live, however you're doing it, supporting independent podcasting.
11901563	11902583	You know what we say every week?
11903083	11908304	All we ask, if you enjoy the show, tell a person, tell two people, post a nice review on iTunes.
11908604	11909804	Just help us spread the word.
11910004	11911585	We don't have ads in the show yet.
11911605	11912765	I always say yet because you never know.
11912785	11916146	We might want to someday, but if we haven't for eight years, I mean, shit.
11916186	11919327	Who's going to buy the ad space on the show?
11920247	11924548	We certainly don't ask for any money from you, and we're not going to ask for any money from you to do this show or what have you.
11924588	11925968	So all we ask is just help spread the word.
11926268	11927649	That's all we want.
11927749	11930269	Thank you guys so much for downloading and wasting your Sunday evening with us.
11930309	11931110	We really appreciate it.
11931410	11932250	Have a wonderful week.
11932470	11934090	We'll be back to do it all again next week.
11934210	11935571	Yes, we'll be here next week.
11937091	11942013	Next week, I've got Conan O'Brien live on Friday, so I know I'll definitely talk about that, even though that really has nothing to do with games.
11942193	11942933	I've got a few weeks.
11943614	11945354	Loki wanted me to talk about that, so I will.
11946335	11947375	What else is going on next week?
11947415	11949936	I've got Rocky and lots of games, I'm sure.
11950516	11956859	Lots more Magic Sword, Double Impact, and also World of Warcraft, because my characters... I have lots of games to play.
11957349	11958330	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
