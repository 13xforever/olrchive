0	18840	Tonight, April 18th, 2010, PlayStation Network releases are on the move.
18840	23000	Does playing violent video games impact your sleep and how can you get free soundtracks
23000	31800	from recent releases?
31800	37800	Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 363 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game
37800	40640	talk show where every gamer has a voice.
40640	43960	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,
43960	46480	the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
46480	49360	Does it count if I only have half a voice?
49360	52400	You know, I just got this feeling coming in here tonight, Dark Sakura, that you really
52400	55040	weren't prepared for tonight's episode and that's okay.
55040	58200	We all have our off days, but let me, let me paint a picture for the listeners.
58200	61360	Just, just imagine if you will, you know, I get here to Jamie's house and yeah, I get
61360	62360	here.
62360	64660	You should hear about an hour before showtime because you know, we have to prep the intro
64660	68160	and get the mixing board set up and all the things that have to happen to make a show
68160	69160	work.
69160	70160	I wasn't naked.
70160	71160	No, you weren't naked.
71160	72160	Thank God.
72160	77040	But the minute I walk in the door and I start to kind of walk back towards the room, Jamie's
77040	78480	like, Oh, hold on a minute.
78480	79760	And she runs to the bathroom.
79760	80760	Like, like she's the flash.
80760	83000	Oh, do not.
83000	86760	She runs to the bathroom like the flash and I'm like, Oh, Oh, I guess she just had Taco
86760	88800	Bell for lunch or something.
88800	93640	And she comes out and she, she's, she's carrying something and she, she runs into a room and
93640	94880	I'm like, what is going on?
94880	102320	And she's like, sorry, I just, I didn't want you to see my unmentionables drawing.
102320	104240	Like girl, please.
104240	105520	Like I've never seen a bra before.
105520	107840	I might be gay, but it doesn't mean that, you know.
107840	109680	But I am modest.
109680	110760	No, I know.
110760	112600	I'm a very modest person.
112600	118440	I may be a modest in personality, but I make up for it in personal modesty.
118440	121800	And she probably doesn't appreciate me telling that story on the air, but it's funny.
121800	122800	And that's what's most important.
122800	123800	You're worse than my mother.
123800	124800	All right.
124800	128400	Also say hello to the one and only, uh, tech master low key.
128400	129400	Hello.
129400	132680	Thankfully I have not seen his unmentionables hanging up to dry, even though we lived together
132680	133680	for a couple of years.
133680	136880	He was, he was very good about folding his laundry because we had a dryer and probably
136880	137880	putting it away.
137880	138880	Yes.
138880	141680	You can't put a bra in the dryer.
141680	142680	It warps.
142680	143680	Exactly.
143680	145680	Didn't we learn anything from watching Hedvig?
145680	149240	Uh, we put, you know, uh, bras in the dryer all the time.
149240	150240	It's just fine.
150240	151240	Yeah.
151240	152240	You don't do it when you pay 50 bucks for them.
152240	153240	All right.
153240	154240	Eddie out.
154240	155240	All right.
155240	159880	Uh, once in a while we talk about video games here on this program, not just drying bra,
159880	163120	drying bras, but how was your week, low key?
163120	168040	Tons of the, uh, young male demographic really want to know how to wash a bra.
168040	170160	That's important life skills.
170160	171160	You know what?
171160	172160	You know what?
172160	173160	Wait till you're married.
173160	174160	You know what?
174160	175160	You'll get a woman to sleep with you like that.
175160	176160	If you know how to do her laundry.
176160	177160	Seriously.
177160	183280	If Dan would do my laundry, I'd be happy, but I'm too afraid he'll screw it up.
183280	184280	True story.
184280	189380	Um, dark soccer and I took a trip to the cherry blossom festival yesterday in San Francisco
189380	192360	and Jamie had one of her friends and I had Alan with me and it was like the four of us
192360	193360	in San Francisco.
193360	197440	We were at the San Francisco cherry blossom festival and we went to this bookstore, the
197440	198440	Japanese bookstore.
198440	199440	You know the name of it?
199440	200440	I don't know.
200440	201440	Okay.
201440	202440	Thank you.
202440	203440	Um, good shoe tight.
203440	204440	Uh, so they, it's a really large store.
204440	208080	Like they have magazines on the first floor and uh, you know that you can get a copy of
208080	212160	for me to their manga and entire yaoi section, which is pretty impressive, but they have
212160	216740	some funny like English books upstairs, like gift gag books, like one little section and
216740	222160	one of the books I saw was porn for women and you open it up and it's just like pictures
222160	226480	of guys like not like, no, I mean they're clothed and everything, but it's like a guy
226480	230880	holding a baby saying like, gosh, why don't I take care of the child for an hour so you
230880	234160	can go out to a movie or something and you know, or vacuuming.
234160	235160	Yeah.
235160	238160	Guys have naked vacuuming and you know what?
238160	241000	I'm actually, I don't really think that many of those guys are super attractive because
241000	242400	they're like too muscular.
242400	246680	You know, I like, I like a, I like a David Bowie.
246680	247680	You like him a little nerdy.
247680	248680	I like him a little androgynous.
248680	249680	All right.
249680	250680	All right.
250680	259520	And I married Dan who was like so completely dude it doesn't, but you know, Dan fights
259520	266560	with me and, and you know what the, you know what the song is Break Up to Make Up.
266560	273320	Oh, well, hey, oh, hey, all right, well, uh, let's uh, get into video games and start off
273320	275040	the show as we usually do.
275040	280120	Not with a broad discussion or, or cherry blossom discuss him, but for the record, what?
280120	282800	It's a really comfy bra.
282800	284000	How was your gaming week?
284000	285000	Help.
285000	286720	Oh wait, I have to say the spiel about the chat room.
286720	291600	Uh, we do tape live every week on all games radio, www.allgames.com at six Pacific right
291600	292920	after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
292920	296280	If you are listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chair room.
296280	298320	If we haven't scared you off yet, congratulations.
298320	299880	Chat dot orange lounge, radio.com.
299880	301620	Jamie, how was your gaming week?
301620	304080	I did lots of gaming, Rob.
304080	311840	I've beaten espa beluga whale, too.
311840	314080	Why do I want to add another syllable there?
314080	315080	Espa-gluda.
315080	316080	Yes.
316080	317080	Two.
317080	318080	Espa-gluda.
318080	319080	Twice on my iPhone.
319080	320080	Dose.
320080	322700	It is amazing on the iPhone.
322700	330080	It is seriously easy to control, very, very, very, very, very, very overwhelmingly Japanese
330080	332400	as in they didn't bother translating it, just the text.
332400	335840	Um, and in fact, the endings have a little bit of Engrish in them.
335840	339000	I think it's hilarious and it's just fun.
339000	340000	It's really fun.
340000	344540	You have like two different, you have two modes with three difficulties and, um, the,
344540	347440	the way that I've just been playing in novice mode, just to get used to it, of course, of
347440	348720	course I beat it.
348720	355200	Um, but in novice mode you have auto fire on and, um, you only have your, what is it?
355200	357060	Your enlightened attack or something.
357060	362120	And then it, you have to, then you've got another thing open for regular mode and then
362120	366400	all of your selections open, including your fire on the other.
366400	369720	So, but really I just like shooting stuff and it's really, it's a gorgeous game.
369720	370720	It is gorgeous.
370720	375840	I've actually on my, um, my Twitter, I've put a few, I actually put probably my last
375840	379480	three twit pic posts have been pictures of the game.
379480	381120	So it's pretty epic.
381120	384560	I find I've been really neglecting my Twitter these past couple of weeks.
384560	385560	Like I've just been very bad.
385560	386840	That's what happens when you're getting there.
386840	389480	Which is, no, it has nothing to do with that.
389480	393480	I think it has to do with the fact that I, I'm having, I mean, here's the thing, there's
393480	397180	a lot of great OLR listeners that follow me on Twitter and I want to share, especially
397180	402400	like the gamey related things and you know, funny life stories and little, you know, vignettes
402400	407960	and little things like, yes, vignettes, it's a fun word to say vignette, uh, in 140.
407960	413600	Is that the brand of your bra vignette, um, 140 characters or less.
413600	414600	But here's the thing.
414600	422560	My bra is comfy, I'm having a hard time justifying my continued existence and participation on
422560	429360	a website where Justin Bieber is the number one topic of discussion every single day.
429360	433360	Like I kind of feel like on moral grounds, I kind of object.
433360	434360	You know what, Rob?
434360	435360	I don't pay attention to that shit.
435360	436360	It makes things a lot better.
436360	442040	Whenever you go to twitter.com, trending topics, Justin Bieber, because half the people are
442040	446000	like, you know, you know, fawning over him, the other half are like, who's Justin, Justin
446000	447000	Bieber.
447000	448000	I really don't know who that is.
448000	449000	Anyway.
449000	450240	I don't look at the trending topics.
450240	456480	I think like a Disney channel, I still want to get President Cat as a trending topic.
456480	458000	We tried that a long time ago.
458000	461880	We got, we got us a mention on some of the game blogs, but it didn't, didn't get trending
461880	462880	topics.
462880	463880	They're, they're, they're buttholes.
463880	464880	All right.
464880	465880	Love, love, love, love.
465880	466880	All right.
466880	467880	Anyway.
467880	468880	Sorry.
468880	477920	We got us Espa Galuda, Beluga, I played Beluga, um, um, um, oh yeah, I actually started a
477920	481360	little bit of Braid and then, um, I remember that I had a whole bunch of other stuff I
481360	482360	had to do.
482360	483360	I played some STO.
483360	487720	I'm really way behind on Star Trek Online right now and I will tell everybody why, and
487720	489360	you saw me working on it.
489360	496400	Um, so I'm going to give it a plug because I can, the temple that I go to, um, here in
496400	501720	Sacramento or Orangeville, technically, um, temple or Rishon is having a fundraiser, big,
501720	507960	big fundraiser in the area, um, on, on Sunday, the 25th, it's called All That Jazz.
507960	508960	Just look it up online.
508960	513600	Um, big fundraiser, twenties, thirties, forties themed kind of roundabout.
513600	518240	And I'm doing their newsletter, I'm doing a big newspaper for them as a giveaway to
518240	522960	everyone who comes in and you know, so that's what I've been tearing my hair out over and
522960	523960	I was sick.
523960	528920	So if you're in the area, if you're in the area, come share a lahaim, spend a good 60
528920	529920	bucks and go.
529920	530920	All right.
530920	531920	It's a, it's a fundraiser.
531920	537460	It's for a good cause, but as a result, I've had no life and I've been sick on top of it
537460	540640	and I'm actually feeling a lot better today than I did.
540640	544320	My voice is coming and going, but I've been sick.
544320	547440	So while I've been sick, I've been working on this.
547440	551360	So yeah, but it's coming along well.
551360	555060	Tiger Claw in our chat room, uh, links us to a Wikipedia article on Justin Bieber because
555060	558460	of course Wiki will solve everything, but let me put it in a nutshell.
558460	560800	You know what, like Donny Osmond was like 30 years ago.
560800	562160	Like he was so Mormon.
562160	566600	Oh, this guy's like, yeah, that's just, that's, that's basically what Justin Bieber is now,
566600	567600	but without the crazy sister.
567600	568600	He has hat hair.
568600	569600	Yeah.
569600	571600	Anyway, that please no more Justin Bieber talk on this program.
571600	572600	He has hat hair.
572600	575640	Uh, and then Shahran says, if you have that much of a problem with it, then maybe you
575640	576840	should stop using Twitter.
576840	579960	Shahran, that's exactly what's happened the past couple of weeks.
579960	582560	I've been Facebooking and now four squares.
582560	585800	The other one I use, which I really shouldn't use, like I'm going to get posted on please
585800	588440	rob me.com, but I'm kind of addicted to it.
588440	589440	Like I can't explain it.
589440	591200	It's, it's partially a game.
591200	593480	They made a game out of social networking.
593480	594480	I don't know.
594480	595480	You know what?
595480	596480	I pretty much stick with my Facebook.
596480	599280	Look, at least I gave up Farmville, so I think I deserve props for that.
599280	603400	I'm trying to pay more attention to Twitter because I've, as I was telling you yesterday
603400	609280	about my plan to become, um, a true nothing celebrity, you know, I want to be famous for
609280	610280	absolutely nothing.
610280	611280	Like Paris Hilton.
611280	616160	I said, I'm not going to put my twat on the internet, but you have to be rich.
616160	618540	Well, that's what sponsorships for.
618540	619540	Not necessarily.
619540	620540	Tila Tequila.
620540	624640	I mean, I, I look at her and I go, I can remind me why she's famous.
624640	631560	I can have eight babies at once, but no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I want to be, I, I'm, I'm going
631560	637080	for, um, I'm going for a certain, I'm going for Warhol famous because you either have
637080	640440	to be slutty or rich, actually mostly slutty.
640440	642160	I'm going to hire people to be me in public.
642160	651560	You should have your own bra company, designer bras, designer bras, smiley faces over the
651560	652560	boob or something.
652560	653560	I don't know.
653560	655200	I'm going to finish working on my cork.
655200	656200	All right.
656200	657200	Yes.
657200	658200	Please.
658200	659200	Let's go to a Loki with the, how was your gaming week?
659200	660200	Loki?
660200	661200	Um, it was all right.
661200	662200	Didn't play a whole lot.
662200	665560	Um, just some of the typical stuff like grand theft auto, of course, still playing some
665560	666560	of that.
666560	668120	This sucked the last few days.
668120	673240	Uh, my coworkers have been out of the office for different reasons and so it's been very
673240	678560	difficult to find a game and when I do get a game, everybody quits cause I kicked crap
678560	679560	out of them.
679560	680560	All right.
680560	681560	Yes.
681560	682560	Which is very disappointing.
682560	683560	There's a little echo there.
683560	684560	Sorry.
684560	686680	And then, um, what else?
686680	687680	New stuff.
687680	688680	I've been playing.
688680	695040	Um, I tried, uh, no more heroes paradise or whatever the hell it's called in Japan.
695040	700000	It's the 360 port of no more heroes, the game on the Wii.
700000	703720	And I got to say, I like it better on the 360 than on the Wii.
703720	706440	Um, it just seemed easier for me to control.
706440	711560	Granted, it's not as fun as, you know, slashing people to death, but, um, it is still pretty
711560	713480	cool the way you do a lot of the moves.
713480	720840	So, um, in place of, you know, swinging the Wii remote, you actually use the, um, uh,
720840	723840	the right analog stick to do some of those moves.
723840	727160	And same with the wrestling moves and stuff, except you use it with, uh, the left and right
727160	728160	analog sticks.
728160	730240	Um, but it actually works pretty cool.
730240	735320	The only, uh, gripe I have about it is, um, I mean, the game itself is in English, uh,
735320	739840	the dialogues in English, um, and you have the choice between English or Japanese dialogue.
739840	744640	The problem is they did not sync up the, um, mouth movements to the English dialogue.
744640	746440	It's only synced up to the Japanese dialogue.
746440	752080	And I mean, it is way off for the English dialogue, but, uh, it's a fun game overall.
752080	757800	And, I mean, I've played the original on the Wii, so it's kind of just, uh, rehashed stuff
757800	762440	for me, but, um, I'm enjoying it quite a bit, so hopefully I'll be able to play my way through
762440	763440	that.
763440	769960	Um, and then I played a little bit on the arcade cabinet, broke out some Marvel vs.
769960	776200	Capcom 2 and, uh, Capcom vs. SNK 2, so, uh, that was pretty fun.
776200	780520	I'm sorry to derail you for a minute, Loki, because I do love Capcom vs. SNK as well,
780520	782360	but I need to talk to Jamie for a minute.
782360	783360	Is that glue?
783360	784360	Yes.
784360	785360	That you're putting down there?
785360	786360	Glue?
786360	787360	Okay.
787360	788360	Jamie's working on an art project.
788360	789360	It's glue.
789360	790360	Are you putting these pictures on the website, or is this a private thing?
790360	791360	Yeah, I'm gonna do it on the website.
791360	792360	Okay.
792360	794760	So Jamie's working on an art project during the show, which is fine, but she's using a
794760	799760	lot of glue, and I want to remind the listeners, we're in kind of an enclosed space here in
799760	800760	the studio.
800760	801760	It's not stinky glue.
801760	806680	So we're all currently inhaling glue during this show, as if we weren't crazy enough.
806680	807680	Right now.
807680	809120	You have to be really close to glue.
809120	811680	Back again in about 15 minutes, and see if all the-
811680	814080	I've got it right under my nose, because I'm holding the damn mic.
814080	815080	Great.
815080	816080	Great.
816080	817080	You of all people.
817080	819880	And for the record, the stuff that I'm using is Mod Podge.
819880	822920	And looks like a Yoplait yogurt container.
822920	823920	It does.
823920	824920	A little bit.
824920	825920	But not safe for you.
825920	827800	I was like, why are you rubbing yogurt on that?
827800	828800	So weird.
828800	829920	All right.
829920	835120	Did you have anything else you wanted to say about your gaming week, Loki?
835120	836760	Um, no.
836760	838280	That's basically all I played this week.
838280	842840	I wanted to go back to Final Fantasy 13, but I was talking to my friend who's actually
842840	844560	at the same point in the game.
844560	851040	Actually, his wife already finished Final Fantasy 13, and it's just kind of like...
851040	852040	It sounds annoying.
852040	859000	You know, he's like, ah, the ending sucked, and you know, you just put you back before
859000	863360	the game's over, and you don't really get to see the results of your actions and that
863360	864360	kind of stuff.
864360	866200	So I'm like, eh, that sounds kind of disappointing.
866200	869240	But I will finish it eventually, so I don't have to play it anymore.
869240	870240	All right.
870240	873640	That's kind of sad, because I mean, like, 10-2 had a freaking epic ending.
873640	875240	Yeah, I'm curious to see what the ending...
875240	876240	And 11 had no ending.
876240	878480	Yeah, but you had to suffer through the whole game in order to see that ending.
878480	881840	I will say, though, Final Fantasy related, speaking of 11 and all these other games,
881840	885640	a lot of stuff is leaking out on 14, because the alpha's going on right now.
885640	889200	So if you really know where to look, there's a lot of videos, and even the soundtrack.
889200	892040	And I wish I'd brought it to the show with me tonight, but unfortunately I don't have
892040	893040	it.
893040	894040	I'll have to bring it next week.
894040	897920	The alpha's leaked, and it looks really good.
897920	901640	But it does look very 11-inspired, so if you didn't like 11, I don't know.
901640	905360	We'll have to see when the game comes out for real, but it definitely looks interesting.
905360	908160	All right, well, if Logie doesn't have anything else for his gaming week, I'll talk about
908160	912120	my gaming week, which of course was a lot of wow, as usual.
912120	916160	But I also played a brand new game that came out this week on Xbox Live Marketplace.
916160	918760	That's right, Magic Sword Double Impact came out this week.
918760	922800	I think actually they're selling it as another name, I think like Final Fight or some other
922800	924240	game nobody played.
924240	926600	But no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
926600	927680	Love Final Fight.
927680	929560	I just love Magic Sword more.
929560	937500	So I was very excited to hear that the game was being re-put out basically on Xbox Live.
937500	943480	And what I really like that they did with it is that they didn't make it just a freaking
943480	950680	dump of the ROM onto the Marketplace with maybe some slightly enhanced graphics.
950680	955280	Now sadly there aren't really enhanced graphics, like you're not going to get Bionic Commando
955280	960880	Rearmed style graphics suddenly out of Final Fight or Magic Sword, but you do have different
960880	961880	filters.
961880	965820	In fact, there's this one very interesting, the default mode that you play, it tries to
965820	969920	make the screen look like an old arcade screen.
969920	972400	So like it has a curvature to it.
972400	973880	It's very interesting the way they do it.
973880	975160	And it looks awesome.
975160	976800	I couldn't really play the game that way.
976800	982640	I had to just put it in normal, ROM, no filter, just the way I remember it mode.
982640	984200	Which is nice because that's there.
984200	988600	So for the purists like me or whatever, elitists, whatever you want to call me, my mode is there.
988600	990960	So that makes me happy.
990960	992000	Remix soundtrack is there too.
992000	996560	I believe it was the same team that did Bionic Commando.
996560	997560	Don't quote me on that.
997560	1000880	One of the other recent Capcom games did that.
1000880	1006460	So it has a remix soundtrack and of course Magic Sword, which I played mostly through
1006460	1009640	the week, was just as great as I remember it many years ago.
1009640	1013580	And if you've never played Magic Sword before, well first I should say Final Fight.
1013580	1016960	It is the flagship game no matter if I think otherwise or not.
1016960	1022440	Final Fight is one of those kind of beat-em-up type of games in the style of Double Dragon
1022440	1023900	or Ninja Turtles.
1023900	1027740	But I think Final Fight was, or Streets of Rage I guess if you will, but I think Final
1027740	1032940	Fight was kind of known for just having a somewhat more memorable characters and some
1032940	1034360	memorable story.
1034360	1039680	And I think it was just kind of an iconic sort of arcade game that was out in the early
1039680	1040680	90s.
1040680	1044040	And I know Dark Soccer, myself, and probably Loki I'll remember from growing up in the
1044040	1045040	pizza parlor and so forth.
1045040	1047400	I actually have a Final Fight collection.
1047400	1050080	I was collecting all of them until that really crappy one came out.
1050080	1052520	But I have Mighty Final Fight and Final Fight Guy.
1052520	1057080	It was one of those multi, and I believe, could you do three at once in the arcade?
1057080	1058080	I can't remember.
1058080	1059080	I can't remember.
1059080	1060080	I think most cabinets were only two.
1060080	1061080	You had three characters.
1061080	1063080	Yeah, you had three characters, but I guess you could really only play two.
1063080	1068200	But what I thought also was neat about both games is that there is a mode where you can
1068200	1071880	have people, random people on the internet, just drop in at any time.
1071880	1074560	Like walk up to the machine, put in a quarter basically, and drop into your game at any
1074560	1075560	time.
1075560	1078800	A la Street Fighter IV I guess you could say had a mode like that.
1078800	1081760	But thankfully it's also very easy to turn that off.
1081760	1089160	So again, I just say props to the team there at Capcom for not just dumping the ROMs and
1089160	1092200	putting them out on the marketplace, but really kind of going back and touching them up.
1092200	1094080	And did they redo the graphics?
1094080	1095080	No.
1095080	1100200	But you know, I think they were able to do a good port economically probably.
1100200	1104080	This was probably a very economic port that they did, and they're probably going to make
1104080	1105220	crap tons of money off of it.
1105220	1107520	So props to Capcom.
1107520	1111240	And I do approve, especially if you remember Magic Sword and Final Fight.
1111240	1112440	I think the games are done very well.
1112440	1116360	I don't think $10 is too much to ask for both games.
1116360	1119200	I think there's a lot of people that are going to be kind of one or the other.
1119200	1120200	I don't know.
1120200	1121200	I'm a little bit of both.
1121200	1122560	I joke that Magic Sword's better.
1122560	1125520	I definitely fondly remember Final Fight.
1125520	1128640	But if you never played these games growing up, at least check out the demo for heaven's
1128640	1129640	sake.
1129640	1132120	So there you go.
1132120	1133120	Let's see.
1133120	1137120	SalaciousPopInChat says something reminiscent of Magic Sword here.
1137120	1142920	I recall spending three hours and at least $25 on Magic Sword with my BFF at the arcade
1142920	1147720	and beating it from scratch and having my BFF take the dark orb at the end from the
1147720	1151560	final boss instead of destroying it and becoming the new evil whatever.
1151560	1152960	OMG spoiler!
1152960	1155960	And my 15-year-old self was pissed and the credits rolled.
1155960	1158000	I believe that's actually an achievement now.
1158000	1161240	I believe if you actually take the dark orb at the end, that's the way you get one of
1161240	1162240	the achievements.
1162240	1163440	But yeah, you have to work there from the beginning.
1163440	1167040	It's not like the Super Nintendo version that let you start on whatever floor you wanted
1167040	1168040	to, basically.
1168040	1170920	Because if you ever played the Super Nintendo one, which is a pretty faithful translation
1170920	1174800	as was Final Fight, you could start on pretty much any floor.
1174800	1175920	But not in this one.
1175920	1177160	You have to start from the beginning.
1177160	1180520	You can continue and you don't have to do it all in one sitting.
1180520	1181920	So yeah, props to that.
1181920	1183920	But that was really the only new, new game I played this week.
1183920	1186600	Everything else is kind of something I've talked about before on the show.
1186600	1190520	So that's going to do it for my gaming week.
1190520	1193140	Getting into housekeeping a little bit before we start the gaming news tonight.
1193140	1195240	Not a whole lot tonight for housekeeping.
1195240	1199360	Just want to plug the Twitter and the Facebook, of course, twitter.com slash o-l-r and we're
1199360	1202000	also on Facebook as well at Orange Lounge Radio.
1202000	1205600	Please friend us or tell some of your friends to add us too.
1205600	1210320	Help us spread the word about our little program because we can't afford to do commercials.
1210320	1214040	Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.
1214040	1216760	Loki's going to start us off with a little bit of gaming news.
1216760	1219200	Actually a lot of gaming news surrounding one company, right?
1219200	1223640	Well it's all kind of tying together and it's all very similar.
1223640	1228600	So you may remember there was a little bit of suing and countersuing with Infinity Ward
1228600	1238160	and or the ex-heads of Infinity Ward and of course Activision over some non-paid royalties.
1238160	1244040	Well now they made an announcement that they are starting their own studio called Respawn
1244040	1247000	Entertainment and they will be partnered with EA.
1247000	1252360	So kind of almost that, you know, the whole thing was Activision was saying that they're
1252360	1259040	going to go off and take their brand with them to their own studio, partnered with EA
1259040	1263040	is sort of true but they're not really taking any brands with them, they're basically going
1263040	1267460	to be doing brand new games, new franchises and that kind of stuff.
1267460	1273360	So it's really neat and right now of course the only two members of this new studio are
1273360	1281880	Jason West and Vince Zappanelli and they didn't really give any information other than the
1281880	1284040	fact that they're hiring.
1284040	1289160	They aren't, I don't believe, allowed to be hiring the ex-Infinity Ward people.
1289160	1293280	Those guys have been leaving though, there's actually quite a few people leaving all throughout
1293280	1294920	the week.
1294920	1305760	Starting off, let's see, we had a few different developers or programmers.
1305760	1314180	We had John Shiring and a senior animator, Bruce Fares, both confirmed that they're leaving
1314180	1321800	Infinity Ward and then also the lead designer, Mackie McKendlish, has also left the company
1321800	1323720	as well.
1323720	1331760	There was also some other guys leaving, let's see, some more lead designers, Zeed Reek,
1331760	1340880	Steve Fakuto, and some programmers, Rainn Wilson, or Winson, and, is it Rainn Wilson
1340880	1341880	on The Office?
1341880	1350920	No, Rainn Winson and Chris, looks like, Sharubi.
1350920	1352340	And I guess he was another lead artist.
1352340	1357860	So they've had a lot of different artists and stuff leaving and whatnot.
1357860	1365280	And of course, to top it all off, Activision, there was one of the execs made a comment
1365280	1370520	about the conditions that they provide for their studios.
1370520	1376360	And according to Activision, because we have to believe them now, the chief operating and
1376360	1384360	financial officer, Thomas Tipple, spoke to the LA Times company town blog, apparently
1384360	1388880	this week, saying that a development house still has nearly 100 people, even though they
1388880	1397680	lost about 10, they've built a deep bench and the change of guard will provide an opportunity
1397680	1403500	for some of the rising stars to put their own stamp on the Call of Duty franchise.
1403500	1409200	And then further, he says that we treat our developers extremely well.
1409200	1413040	Independent Studio, or I continue, I guess, the Activision's Independent Studio model
1413040	1418400	allows developers a lot of creative freedom while we take care of the back office stuff.
1418400	1422400	Unfortunately, that's not exactly how they were painting the picture, so I don't really
1422400	1425960	know if I'd believe all that.
1425960	1429480	There's definitely a little bit of he-said, she-said going on.
1429480	1432560	I think they just need to go on Tyra and work it out, honestly.
1432560	1433560	Here's another thing.
1433560	1434560	It's like a divorce.
1434560	1441840	There was some comment saying that basically that the studio behind Modern Warfare is dead
1441840	1446320	from one of the insiders, I guess, at Infinity Ward.
1446320	1450140	His comment was, they're scared shitless.
1450140	1454900	They never saw this coming, and he's referring to Activision, they can't believe what's going
1454900	1455900	on.
1455900	1460000	At first, they gave us some bullshit about moving up payments, all the money that they
1460000	1462640	owed us to sooner increments.
1462640	1470520	That was when the designer Todd Aldermen and engineer Frank Galletti left.
1470520	1473820	But then the announcement of Respawn and then all the people leaving, they just got their
1473820	1478200	heads in their hands.
1478200	1484200	Basically he was also saying that apparently the morale's really low and that he thinks
1484200	1486400	that the studio's going to continue to crumble.
1486400	1493160	Although there was another insider, I guess, that's kind of painting a more positive picture.
1493160	1497560	First off, yes, it's a shitty situation, but there's two kinds of people left.
1497560	1501680	Ones that are sticking it out for the money and the others who want to make something
1501680	1502760	work.
1502760	1504760	We are not dead.
1504760	1508280	We definitely lost the original team members, but not all the talent.
1508280	1512140	When you talk about people who left, they are the best in the business, but equally
1512140	1515100	everyone in Infinity Ward deserves that same credential.
1515100	1521420	We are here for the long haul of keeping Modern Warfare name alive, but as the article clearly
1521420	1524640	shows, certain people are still pissed about it.
1524640	1527420	We just had a discussion in our Monday meeting.
1527420	1531600	We still have talent that will get us to where we need to go, and now it's time to find our
1531600	1533680	new leader.
1533680	1540040	You know how I'd like to see this whole thing resolved?
1540040	1547040	How?
1547040	1550120	This is the play tip.
1550120	1554680	Bobby Kotek, CEO of an Evil Empire video game company.
1554680	1560440	He's accused of being a douchebag who doesn't know how to run his studios, but he says he
1560440	1563240	knows how to run them just fine and gives them the perfect environment to make games
1563240	1564240	in.
1564240	1565240	Wait, didn't he be the defendant?
1565240	1566240	Oh yeah, he'd be the defendant.
1566240	1567240	Ah, I screwed it all up.
1567240	1568240	Never mind.
1568240	1569240	That's why I'm not a lawyer.
1569240	1570240	I'm just, I'm Shmo on a video game show.
1570240	1574680	But no, I mean, this is all, it's very interesting how this is all playing out in public.
1574680	1579120	Yeah, um, I, I don't know.
1579120	1583040	The problem I see is, you know, they're saying one, well Activision's saying one thing, how
1583040	1586080	they, you know, give their studios creative freedom and stuff.
1586080	1590080	And then at the same time we see the Call of Duty franchise split between three studios
1590080	1591080	now.
1591080	1595240	And the, you know, all this, the reasoning why they wanted to leave, or I guess were
1595240	1599960	made to leave, is because they wouldn't, you know, they didn't have that creative freedom
1599960	1604640	and they refused to, I guess, go along with what their plans were.
1604640	1607680	So I don't know.
1607680	1613400	It just sounds like a big mess and unfortunately, I think Activision might suffer a little bit
1613400	1616320	for it.
1616320	1620200	Tiger Claw says this needs the law and order gavel.
1620200	1623760	There you go.
1623760	1631080	Um, I don't know, I, I saw a video a couple days ago and I, I thought you were gonna get
1631080	1634920	to it, but I guess maybe you didn't see it, that showed this, the credits of Infinity
1634920	1639220	Ward and it just shows how the red lines through all the people that have left.
1639220	1642100	And while there does seem to be quite a few people that are still there, it's like kind
1642100	1646560	of like a lot of the testers and sort of the, like, I hate to use insulting words, but kind
1646560	1650840	of like the lower entry level positions seem to mostly be the ones that are still there.
1650840	1655440	And then like most of the higher up, so are like out and you got to really wonder what
1655440	1656640	the longterm impact is going to be.
1656640	1660520	I mean, you know, Modern Warfare 2 is a huge game and whereas, you know, I'm sure they'll
1660520	1665160	be, I mean, they got, Activision got another studio to make Guitar Hero 3.
1665160	1666160	Well let me put it this way.
1666160	1669320	So somebody else will do Modern Warfare, but it's definitely going to be different.
1669320	1672960	Yeah, they're going to still have Call of Duty games, I mean, look at World of War.
1672960	1677680	Yeah, it didn't sell as well as Modern Warfare did, but it still sold really well and that's
1677680	1678920	Treyarch for you.
1678920	1683320	They're going to give it to Treyarch and then whoever the hell this new company is, um,
1683320	1687040	they're going to kind of split it up and fortunately it's never going to be as good, I guess, as
1687040	1688920	the Infinity Ward games.
1688920	1692320	And you may still see, you know, Infinity Ward continue on, but I have a feeling there's
1692320	1695560	going to be a lot more people leaving and especially if they drag this out long enough
1695560	1700440	and not, and they are not paying their employees, you know, the royalties that are due, you'll
1700440	1703720	probably see a lot of these people that are, you know, kind of sticking out, start to question
1703720	1705720	whether they're going to leave or not.
1705720	1710880	So I have a feeling this is just going to keep on going.
1710880	1714880	It's going to be very interesting to see, uh, what kind of game comes out this Christmas
1714880	1716560	if there is a Modern Warfare game at all.
1716560	1719520	I imagine there's got to be, but I'm just interested to see what, how it's going to
1719520	1720520	be different.
1720520	1721640	You know, it's just going to be another Call of Duty game.
1721640	1724080	I thought they were working on a Vietnam one or something like that.
1724080	1725080	Hmm.
1725080	1726080	Oh yeah, that's right.
1726080	1727080	Cause every other year, huh?
1727080	1728080	Yeah.
1728080	1731480	And all they're going to do is just use the same engine that, um, Infinity Ward created,
1731480	1734240	but Treyarch will be the one putting together the game.
1734240	1736440	So it'll be another World of War.
1736440	1738520	And what happens to the, uh, former employees?
1738520	1741720	Do you think some of them are banding together to form a new studio and what will they make
1741720	1742720	games like?
1742720	1746600	Um, actually the people they're leaving are not going to that Respawn Entertainment.
1746600	1749440	I think mainly because it's part of the closet.
1749440	1750960	They can't hire those people.
1750960	1751960	Oh.
1751960	1756840	Um, you know, right now it's a non-compete thing, but it's got to be good on the resume.
1756840	1762160	I worked on the greatest selling fucking video game of the past few years, you know, that
1762160	1769160	and the fact that non-compete clauses in California actually I don't think are valid from what
1769160	1770160	I've read.
1770160	1771160	So.
1771160	1772160	Interesting.
1772160	1773760	I'm not, um, certainly I'm not a lawyer.
1773760	1776880	I can't even tell the difference between a plaintiff and a defendant, but I mean, there's
1776880	1778960	a lot of development studios in like Canada and stuff.
1778960	1783280	I mean, would that water if they, I don't know, but up north, we'll find out what's
1783280	1784280	going to happen.
1784280	1785960	They'll just all play on doing the accusation.
1785960	1792280	I know that I was just, I was ad libbing earlier when he ad lib, you say stupid things sometimes.
1792280	1798200	So anyhow, but yes, the plaintiff is the one doing the suing and the defendant is the one
1798200	1801800	that, not that I've ever had to be a plaintiff or defendant, but I did.
1801800	1806080	I was on a jury once years ago and, and it was, it definitely played out like an episode
1806080	1807080	of law and order.
1807080	1809240	It was, uh, it was interesting.
1809240	1810240	Anyhow, plaintiff.
1810240	1812240	No, no, no, no, no.
1812240	1815880	I was thinking of Jay.
1815880	1816880	All right.
1816880	1822080	Look, uh, moving on to other stories that, uh, have a little less to do with, um, the
1822080	1825520	shakeups and so forth, but a little more, well actually no, this, this is about a different
1825520	1827840	type of shakeup and very much about television.
1827840	1831720	Um, I'm sure a lot of you guys that listen to this program also kind of follow a lot
1831720	1835160	of the other type of, um, you know, nerdy news, if you will, on the internet.
1835160	1838840	And I'm sure a lot of you are big fans of Conan O'Brien, um, although there's probably
1838840	1842120	some of you that, that dish out the haterade when it comes to Conan O'Brien as well.
1842120	1846680	So love him or hate him, Conan O'Brien of course found a new home this week on TBS and
1846680	1849680	ironically going to be bumping George Lopez back an hour.
1849680	1850680	It was his idea.
1850680	1851680	Yes.
1851680	1854280	But, but the difference is George Lopez was like, no, no, I want you to do that.
1854280	1857500	I would be better off with you coming over here.
1857500	1861480	So cool beans, Conan O'Brien will be back on TV for those that like him and for those
1861480	1863860	that don't, then you can watch whatever you want.
1863860	1867480	But the interesting part about this, I mean that part doesn't have anything to do with
1867480	1872460	video games, but now more, now that a deal has been signed, more news is coming out about
1872460	1875880	some of the other deals that were presented to Conan.
1875880	1882560	Cause of course when he left NBC, it really seemed like everybody, but like CBS and ABC
1882560	1886740	was throwing something at him because obviously CBS, ABC have their own lineups, but everybody
1886740	1887740	was throwing something at him.
1887740	1889760	We all know Fox was in negotiations.
1889760	1894180	I think they came out and said, um, one of the other TV stations was, was in talks with
1894180	1895280	him as well.
1895280	1901480	But what is very interesting as well, um, team Conan was thinking actually of one idea
1901480	1903800	way outside the network box.
1903800	1909680	There was actually discussions with Microsoft about an Xbox deal for Conan show that would
1909680	1912240	have broken new ground.
1912240	1916000	Now they don't obviously say a lot of specifics about what that deal would have entailed,
1916000	1921680	but you can sort of connect the dots here and think about, okay, well we all know Xbox
1921680	1924880	sells TV shows, if you will, I mean that's part of the business they're in.
1924880	1929760	They sell movies and TV shows and we've seen what's happened over at Sony's camp with the
1929760	1935560	tester show, which by the way recently ended and I stopped watching it halfway through
1935560	1937760	and had it spoiled for me on the internet who won.
1937760	1940840	But if you watched even the first episode of the show, you could see who was going to
1940840	1942640	win that show coming from a mile away.
1942640	1946400	But anyway, that's not the point, despite the fact whether the tester was a good or
1946400	1948680	bad show, whatever your opinion is on that.
1948680	1952560	It did set this really interesting precedent and I said this a few weeks ago when I first
1952560	1957440	reviewed the show is that, okay, maybe the tester is a little bit of a wonky show, but
1957440	1962720	it's still fascinating that there is this budget, there is money, there is drive, there
1962720	1968040	are embedded commercials and there's ways to make money off direct to PlayStation network
1968040	1971000	types of TV shows.
1971000	1974520	And even though the tester might be weird, it's really interesting to see what could
1974520	1976960	maybe come next out of this.
1976960	1981080	Well, you now look at what you hear about what's going on over with Microsoft and the
1981080	1986400	deal they offered and you could kind of think maybe Microsoft was going to do some type
1986400	1992680	of free show or ad supported show or who knows, maybe they would have sold certain types of
1992680	1997840	the formats of the show or whatever of Conan O'Brien like every night.
1997840	2003640	What's also interesting, and when I was first telling a friend of mine about this, he said,
2003640	2010100	is this maybe like one versus a hundred was on Xbox?
2010100	2013120	And I was thinking, well, that would be really interesting too, is that what if the whole
2013120	2018040	show had actually played out live on Xbox network and you could watch the show live?
2018040	2022800	I mean, if you think about it, Microsoft has the bandwidth to make something like that
2022800	2025520	happen and they have the resources to do it.
2025520	2030160	I mean, isn't it really only a matter of time before you could get live television through
2030160	2031160	your Xbox?
2031160	2032160	I mean, Netflix and everything.
2032160	2038840	And it makes sense because a lot more people are playing games versus watching TV.
2038840	2043680	Even though the Conan O'Brien deal fell through or whatever and Conan decided to go with,
2043680	2046480	you know, I want to say traditional TV, but that's not really the case.
2046480	2050520	He went with basic cable, but still, you know, a more traditional type of format.
2050520	2055000	It's very interesting to see that, okay, well, Microsoft's pursuing these types of ideas
2055000	2056000	then.
2056000	2059640	So what might happen in the next year or so?
2059640	2062360	Is it possible we're going to see a live interactive talk show?
2062360	2065600	I think that would be a very logical place for Microsoft to go.
2065600	2068560	Can you imagine, let's take the nerd angle on it.
2068560	2073520	Instead of something more like late show type of programming, what if Xbox had a program
2073520	2076400	like the screen savers?
2076400	2082880	And I'm not talking what it turned into years later, but old school Leo Laporte, tech TV
2082880	2086720	screen savers that was interactive with the Xbox audience.
2086720	2091760	Here's my problem with that and it's just, and it goes for anything even on like the
2091760	2094160	PlayStation Network or Wii or whatever.
2094160	2099520	Any of those shows are going to be obviously biased towards one console platform and it
2099520	2105160	just to me would seem like someone just shoving an advertisement in my face.
2105160	2109120	You know, basically that's how I even look at like the tester and stuff.
2109120	2110120	Oh, okay.
2110120	2112560	It's a giant commercial for your fucking games.
2112560	2113560	Awesome.
2113560	2120400	You know, same with the, you know, I didn't think, you know, and I got to give the tester
2120400	2121400	credit.
2121400	2125520	I mean, yeah, the show had flaws and had plenty of flaws, but it wasn't terrible.
2125520	2131540	I think a lot of people judge that show without ever watching it for even five minutes.
2131540	2134760	And I'll tell you what, the production values on the show were not terrible.
2134760	2135760	Could it have been better?
2135760	2136760	Yes.
2136760	2139040	But what is it like the worst thing that ever happened to PlayStation Network?
2139040	2140180	Not at all.
2140180	2144920	In fact, it does set an interesting precedent where, okay, it is viable.
2144920	2146880	They embedded commercials in the show.
2146880	2150440	Granted, you could fast forward them, but I bet there's a way they could get around
2150440	2151440	that.
2151440	2152880	I mean, they embedded commercials in the content.
2152880	2157520	I mean, yeah, Loki, it was kind of a commercial for some of the games and it's more of, I
2157520	2160440	would say it's more of like a Sony product, whatever.
2160440	2164240	But doesn't Microsoft kind of do the same thing when they, whenever they do their Major
2164240	2168940	Nelson at PAX East, they're showing crackdown, they're showing the Microsoft stuff.
2168940	2174140	They're not going to say, hey, we were at PAX East this week and oh, APB is here.
2174140	2177940	You don't really see that on the Microsoft content.
2177940	2178940	You know what I mean?
2178940	2180960	You do expect there's going to be that certain type of synergy.
2180960	2184360	And I don't know, watching the tester, I didn't feel like the game stuff was shoved down my
2184360	2185360	throat.
2185360	2192760	I kind of felt like, okay, I'm watching a show about video game testers or whatever.
2192760	2196560	And you know, you kind of expect there's going to be video games involved and I'm not suddenly
2196560	2201040	going to see them playing the Nintendo Wii on a Sony PlayStation show.
2201040	2202040	Right?
2202040	2203040	Yeah.
2203040	2204040	So.
2204040	2205040	But that's my point though.
2205040	2210120	I mean, it's just, I don't know, I mean, I guess if you want, you know, product stuff
2210120	2216200	shoved into your face and you're going to subscribe to their online magazine, but it's
2216200	2221180	just, I don't really want to see that now if they actually brought the screensavers
2221180	2226280	as the screensavers were to the network, then yeah, that would be fine.
2226280	2229120	But it's not going to be that way.
2229120	2234420	It's going to be kind of biased and that's not something I'm really interested in.
2234420	2238440	I see what you're saying, because there would be an Xbox or a Microsoft centric spin on
2238440	2239440	it.
2239440	2242720	You're not going to see Macs and things like that on the Xbox screensavers.
2242720	2248840	Because it wouldn't be like, yeah, I bought my 360 and it died four days later, you know.
2248840	2252320	You know, come to think of it, sorry to cut you off, but doesn't Microsoft kind of have,
2252320	2256240	I mean, I think of, and I don't know if this is still around, but I'm thinking, okay,
2256240	2261240	because we're sort of relatives, we're like distant cousins of this, okay?
2261240	2264120	So All Games Network is the network we're on, right?
2264120	2267520	Who is run by Scott Rubin, right?
2267520	2271680	And Scott used to be on a TV show on G4 called G4 TV, right?
2271680	2273840	I'm playing like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon here, right?
2273840	2274840	Okay.
2274840	2281720	Scott hosted with, Laura Foy was one and the other girl was Tina, not, I keep wanting to
2281720	2285500	say Tina Fey, but it's not that, it's, oh gosh, I'm going to, I'm going to get yelled
2285500	2290320	at by the chat room for not knowing this, but these two gals hosted the show with Scott.
2290320	2296640	After the G4 TV thing folded, that show, they went on to do some Microsoft centric show,
2296640	2299160	like 10 something it was called.
2299160	2303100	I know there's going to be, there's people that have listened to allgames.com for years
2303100	2306640	that are going to jump in here and yell what it is in our chat room at chat.com.
2306640	2311120	But Microsoft is doing a show like that, or was at one time, like they did these little
2311120	2312120	specials.
2312120	2313120	Tina Wood.
2313120	2314120	Thank you, Tina Wood.
2314120	2317840	And they were doing these little specials for some time that weren't available on Xbox
2317840	2321040	per se, but it was on like Microsoft's website and they were all about like, you know, fun
2321040	2326800	features of Microsoft and going out to the, you know, uh, shows and so forth and showing
2326800	2328200	what's going on.
2328200	2332520	Because another point I just wanted to say, if there was a Conan centric show on Xbox
2332520	2336040	or what have you, I don't think it would be restricted to just Xbox.
2336040	2338320	I think there'd be a way to get it on your Zune.
2338320	2341600	There'd be a way to get it on your Windows mobile phone and there'd be ways to get it
2341600	2346240	on your desktop computer, but the technology is certainly there.
2346240	2347240	Yeah.
2347240	2349240	There you go.
2349240	2350240	On 10.
2350240	2351240	Thank you.
2351240	2354320	See, I knew, I knew that there's a lot of people listen to us because of the all games
2354320	2356200	connection and how we kind of joined up with that.
2356200	2360920	So I knew some of them have been following, uh, Scott and the old G4 family for years.
2360920	2365620	And yeah, uh, Tiger Claw reminds us, uh, uh, uh, Diane Mazzotta from the old G4 TV days
2365620	2370520	is now on Scott's new show, the Apidae TV, which I watched the iPad special.
2370520	2373480	It was a pretty good every day though.
2373480	2377680	That's, that's going to be a lot of work, app a day, one app a day, an app a day keeps
2377680	2380040	the, uh, Microsoft away, a doctor away.
2380040	2381040	I don't know.
2381040	2382040	All right.
2382040	2383040	Anyhow.
2383040	2384400	Um, so I think it's very interesting.
2384400	2385400	This whole Conan thing.
2385400	2390760	I mean, I can see why it didn't work out, but it does kind of leave a very interesting
2390760	2394680	door open to what might happen in the future.
2394680	2400480	So we'll see anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news.
2400480	2401480	Dark Sakura.
2401480	2402480	Why don't we?
2402480	2407320	Um, you know, we brought up, uh, Final Fight Double Impact earlier, or I'm sorry, Magic
2407320	2412440	Sword Double Impact, Rob, and, um, well the soundtrack is available.
2412440	2422340	You can download, um, the, uh, the remix soundtrack, um, as done by Simon Viklund, um, the guy
2422340	2426040	who also did the score for Bionic Commando Rearmed.
2426040	2433120	Um, I will be, um, of course linking, uh, that in the chatroom, but you can also find
2433120	2438320	it at FinalFightGame.com slash remix.
2438320	2440500	So go, go get it.
2440500	2442000	Love Final Fight music.
2442000	2447120	I also think it's pretty cool that he's just putting it up there for free.
2447120	2451280	I like that these video game companies are, uh, putting up soundtracks for free, but they're
2451280	2454120	not the only ones, right Dark Sakura?
2454120	2457000	Uh, don't think so.
2457000	2458000	Let's see.
2458000	2463880	Um, yeah, also the God of War trilogy, um, soundtrack is available.
2463880	2468160	And uh, of course, uh, I think that's pretty cool that Sony's doing that for God of War
2468160	2469160	3.
2469160	2473320	Um, actually I'm sorry, the whole trilogy, if I'm right.
2473320	2474320	I think so.
2474320	2478560	It's the whole, and God of War is one where they could probably sell it if they wanted
2478560	2479560	to.
2479560	2480560	They did.
2480560	2481560	They did?
2481560	2482560	Yeah.
2482560	2483560	They're giving it away for free?
2483560	2484560	For God of War 3.
2484560	2485560	Oh, interesting.
2485560	2486560	Huh.
2486560	2492700	But yeah, um, you can actually just go to God of War dot com and I think that it's available,
2492700	2494040	um, on the website.
2494040	2498200	I'd be more interested in a dump of the, um, heavy metal soundtrack that they had for,
2498200	2499600	uh, God of War 3.
2499600	2502520	I'm kinda surprised we don't see more game soundtracks out there.
2502520	2503740	I mean, not necessarily for free.
2503740	2505400	The Blood and Metal EP?
2505400	2508520	But you know, I'm talking about, like, even on iTunes.
2508520	2511960	And there, well, I should say that I have seen, there's definitely been an increase
2511960	2516000	of game soundtracks available on iTunes, but you know, one of these game soundtracks are
2516000	2519800	really just promotion for the game at the end of the day, so why not give them out for
2519800	2520800	free?
2520800	2521800	Well, I linked it in the chatroom too.
2521800	2522800	There you go.
2522800	2523800	Good job.
2523800	2528080	Um, also, uh, just wanted to say real quick, uh, we had a little bit of stream downtime.
2528080	2529080	I don't know.
2529080	2530080	We had a stream hiccup that happened.
2530080	2532980	We just kept right on rolling the tape, but, uh, our live listeners are just now coming
2532980	2537720	back on and, uh, there's some, uh, chat comments from before the hiccup and I wanted to get
2537720	2538720	to some of these.
2538720	2542320	Uh, Black Wolf in our chatroom, of course, the one and only Bobby Black Wolf who tapes
2542320	2546280	before us at All Games Radio, he said, I wanted to point out that some of the on 10 stuff
2546280	2550720	from E3 2007 actually showed people playing Wii games.
2550720	2552600	I was surprised.
2552600	2556160	Does that maybe play into the, and I don't want to, maybe I shouldn't go back and open
2556160	2560520	this old can of worms, but does that maybe play into the whole, uh, conspiracy theory
2560520	2565640	from about three years ago before the Wii really took off on OMG, Microsoft wants to
2565640	2566640	buy Nintendo?
2566640	2572240	Like that, like, and, and also hasn't they had, didn't they say at one point that maybe
2572240	2577160	it was Nintendo that said this, I don't know, but somebody said that Microsoft is competing
2577160	2578720	with Sony, not Nintendo.
2578720	2579720	Yeah.
2579720	2584360	So maybe, you know, showing a Wii game is okay, but showing a PS3 game, not okay.
2584360	2585520	And I could see that.
2585520	2587280	I don't know.
2587280	2588280	Anyway.
2588280	2589280	Sorry.
2589280	2590480	I just want to say that now.
2590480	2591480	I didn't want to.
2591480	2592480	Yeah.
2592480	2593480	Really?
2593480	2594480	Yeah.
2594480	2595520	Now that Natal's coming out, they probably won't be showing those a week clips anymore
2595520	2597880	because now they are a little bit more of a competitor.
2597880	2598880	We'll see.
2598880	2601160	Anyway, for the live listeners, we'll play some of the songs from those soundtracks a
2601160	2603300	little later on during our break.
2603300	2606360	For those of you listening on the podcast, you will have to go grab those at the URLs.
2606360	2607840	Dark Sakura already gave you.
2607840	2608840	Yep.
2608840	2609840	Go get them.
2609840	2610840	All right.
2610840	2617200	Well, um, in case you're wondering, the, um, teased Nintendo 3DS is going to be Nintendo's
2617200	2621680	next platform, not necessarily just a revision of the current hardware.
2621680	2624160	It is actually going to be a brand new platform.
2624160	2628160	And that makes sense considering some of the stories we've talked about, the 3DS or stuff
2628160	2634040	that could possibly lend itself to the 3DS, like for example, the patent that was registered,
2634040	2639500	I believe last week for some sort of rumble device built into the new DS.
2639500	2644800	And of course, you know, the fact that the 3DS is going to be in 3D, um, obviously it's
2644800	2650760	going to be probably backwards compatible with, um, the DSI stuff or the Nintendo DS
2650760	2651760	stuff.
2651760	2655280	Um, so yeah, that makes sense, but that's kind of neat.
2655280	2658480	So new platform finally for the handhelds.
2658480	2663440	Um, so in other words, it's not just a DS upgrade.
2663440	2666800	It's a brand new, it is a new thing.
2666800	2669600	Basically they're saying that we've run out of ideas for new games.
2669600	2675720	So now we're going to put out a new Mario game and a new, uh, you know, I, I ha I will
2675720	2678160	say though, I, my interest is piqued with this.
2678160	2683080	I am very curious to see how this plays out because I am, I'm not big on the 3D thing.
2683080	2685160	I think it's a little ridiculous for some of the movies.
2685160	2690160	I mean, yes, avatar was, was pretty, but I mean, honestly the 3D gave me a headache.
2690160	2692720	I think I would have enjoyed avatar just as much in 2D.
2692720	2693720	That's what I'm saying.
2693720	2694720	I mean, was it pretty?
2694720	2695720	Yeah.
2695720	2696720	But would I have enjoyed it just as much in 2D?
2696720	2697720	Of course I would have.
2697720	2703640	Um, so I'm kind of curious if games are really going to make me feel differently about 3D.
2703640	2706640	You know, I think I'd pick up the system one step closer to the holodeck.
2706640	2711440	I, I think it'd be interesting cause I like the fact that it doesn't require, um, glasses
2711440	2713120	to play it, which is kind of cool.
2713120	2714560	Yeah, that is very interesting.
2714560	2719560	And really to be honest with like the 3D TVs and stuff that they're shown on TV, um, I'm
2719560	2723040	not really interested in that stuff because those glasses are so damn expensive.
2723040	2728320	I think the best system out there that they should really go with, and I'm very surprised
2728320	2732720	that they're just going with the actual shutter glasses and stuff, is that real D3D.
2732720	2735080	Cause those glasses are fucking dirt cheap.
2735080	2740640	I mean, they hand them out for like five bucks when you go see a 3D movie, and it works just
2740640	2742920	as well as those shutter glasses.
2742920	2746800	So if they can come up with a TV that supports that, I think that'd be the way to go cause
2746800	2752640	hell, I mean, you don't have enough for your friends or something, just go buy a pack of
2752640	2754760	ten for like, you know, twenty bucks or something.
2754760	2756760	I don't know.
2756760	2761120	Um, it's kind of funny, Sega in our chatroom says, holodeck missed.
2761120	2764080	And if you're new to the show and you've never heard me kind of say, oh, we're one step closer
2764080	2765360	to the holodeck.
2765360	2769760	Every time we hear about this new invention in games or the next, you know, generation
2769760	2772680	of games, cause you know, the show's been on a little while now, when our show started
2772680	2775240	the PlayStation 2 was still new, okay?
2775240	2778340	Whenever these new things are announced, it's always kind of like joking, well, we're one
2778340	2783140	step closer to the holodeck, which from Star Trek The Next Generation was, you know, there
2783140	2789820	is no, you basically were in the environment you wanted to be in or play your game or simulation
2789820	2790820	in.
2790820	2794520	And I kind of think the one thing I could see that could be very cool about 3D is that,
2794520	2798440	like, well, I don't even know if cool is the word I would use, but can you imagine, like,
2798440	2803960	a, not so much on the DS, but like on a big console, a big TV, a 3D version of like Silent
2803960	2804960	Hill?
2804960	2806720	Like, I don't even know if I could play a game like that.
2806720	2810320	I think it just might be too much for me, like sensory overload, you know?
2810320	2815880	All I have to do is make this technology affordable, cause if that system comes out at $200, that's
2815880	2816880	not gonna work.
2816880	2821920	A game like Myst could be, I mean, the reason why I read that quote is because Myst, I don't
2821920	2827160	know, there's a creepiness to Myst, but not like scary.
2827160	2830320	There's just certain, like, I don't know, I played Myst online for a couple weeks.
2830320	2833120	I'd want holodeck phantasmagoria.
2833120	2834120	You're sick.
2834120	2837760	But there's a certain creepiness to it without being, like, just downright scary.
2837760	2840960	Can you imagine 3DF0?
2840960	2842880	I'd barf.
2842880	2845880	Like 3DF0 moves, would move very quickly.
2845880	2848160	F0 is a very fast-moving game.
2848160	2849160	I'd probably barf.
2849160	2850600	I think it might be too much.
2850600	2854840	Here's what I'm surprised, and, you know, we may see this later on, is...
2854840	2860000	Sorry, Tigerclaw in our chatroom, chat.ornsonshade.com says, eh, people will just play WoW and realistic
2860000	2861000	3D.
2861000	2862000	True.
2862000	2865640	It's like arcade games with this kind of technology built in, cause it's just an LCD screen with
2865640	2870240	some sort of, you know, extra screen in front of it that directs the light to your eyes.
2870240	2874040	You know, that'd be perfect because, like, especially sit-down racing games and stuff,
2874040	2877080	you're obviously at a certain distance away from the screen that they could calibrate
2877080	2878920	it to, and there you go.
2878920	2881720	Yeah, but arcade games, I mean...
2881720	2882720	But yeah, but...
2882720	2886480	I don't mean to jump ahead, but I know we have a story coming up later about arcades
2886480	2889360	further on the decline, and it's kinda like...
2889360	2890360	I don't know.
2890360	2891360	That's a lot of money.
2891360	2894280	But that's the thing though, but the arcade games, yeah, they're not releasing a lot of
2894280	2897600	stuff, but the stuff that they are releasing are, like, the big things that you can't do
2897600	2898600	at home type stuff.
2898600	2899600	I see.
2899600	2903740	You know, like the, you know, full-scale racing sims and stuff like that.
2903740	2908260	But just, this would take it one step further, and that would be awesome.
2908260	2910360	So like 3D Mario Kart in the arcade?
2910360	2911360	Exactly.
2911360	2912360	Good times.
2912360	2913360	All right.
2913360	2916800	Well, I was talking about sensory overload, and that kinda ties into the next story, and
2916800	2921040	it's about this study that was conducted by Australian researchers.
2921040	2925440	And what they're trying to do is kinda refute the claim that if you play violent video games
2925440	2928680	before you go to bed, you're gonna have a hard time falling asleep.
2928680	2929880	So what they did is they did this study.
2929880	2934360	They took two groups of teenage boys, sorry, no girls allowed apparently in this study,
2934360	2938640	and they made them play 50 minutes of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, or I'm sorry, Call
2938640	2940160	of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.
2940160	2945480	They split them into two groups, and one group played Call of Duty 4, the other group watched
2945480	2948120	March of the Penguins while lying in bed.
2948120	2950760	And then after 50 minutes, they had to go to sleep.
2950760	2956300	And what they found out, the group that played Modern Warfare overall only took a few minutes
2956300	2959940	longer to fall asleep than those that were watching the movie.
2959940	2961520	That's because it's the March of the Penguins.
2961520	2964240	They would have fallen asleep during the movie.
2964240	2965240	Exactly.
2965240	2966240	It's boring.
2966240	2969880	Well, I think the reason why it might take longer to fall asleep is not, it has nothing
2969880	2971680	to do with the violent content.
2971680	2976080	I think a more accurate thing would have been play Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare versus
2976080	2980720	like Super Mario Galaxy or something, or well, maybe that's not the best, or LittleBigPlanet,
2980720	2983440	you know, something more G-rated in video games.
2983440	2987920	Because, I think the reason why, you know, even though this whole study is supposed to
2987920	2993760	show, oh, it doesn't keep you up as late, you know, whatever, I think even the few minutes
2993760	2996960	were probably because Modern Warfare is more interactive.
2996960	2997960	You're thinking about it more.
2997960	2998960	It's more mentally stimulating.
2998960	3001520	Yeah, it stimulates your mind more than watching a movie.
3001520	3003100	Isn't quite as mentally stimulating.
3003100	3004100	Especially March of the Penguins.
3004100	3009320	I mean, my God, why would you torture someone like that?
3009320	3013400	I mean, like, I love penguins, but March of the Penguins, yeah, I was about to go to sleep.
3013400	3014400	During March of the Penguins.
3014400	3015400	I preferred Happy Feet.
3015400	3016400	Thank you very much.
3016400	3017400	Justino.
3017400	3023800	No, it's, I mean, I've been like, I want to go to the other group.
3023800	3024800	So there you go.
3024800	3028200	But this kind of begs the question, you know, kind of tying into the whole, and I'm asking
3028200	3033380	this to the chat room as well, so chatters, please voice your mind on this one.
3033380	3038280	Has there been a time where video games have ever impacted your sleep?
3038280	3040240	I've had dreams about games.
3040240	3041240	Yeah?
3041240	3046080	The same way you do about movies, you know, and shows and stuff.
3046080	3047080	Maybe like-
3047080	3050800	I've had an interesting Silent Hill dream that I actually wanted to pitch as a game.
3050800	3051800	Oh, really?
3051800	3053840	Yeah, but it would be spoiling the ending.
3053840	3058280	Okay, well, let me not ask so much about the actual dream itself, but let me see your sleep
3058280	3059360	habits.
3059360	3062380	Has video games ever impacted, like, when you go to bed or how late you're staying up
3062380	3063380	at night?
3063380	3064380	Not really.
3064380	3068620	I mean, I have a couple of times gotten caught up in a game, like just playing some Star
3068620	3072880	Trek online, and then I'll realize that I've fallen asleep in a battle or something, and
3072880	3074880	then I'll just turn it off.
3074880	3075880	Nice.
3075880	3078720	I've done that once, by the way.
3078720	3083400	But I, not really, I mean, I stayed up all night playing Blue Dragon, but my plan first
3083400	3087600	was to stay up all night, and I played Blue Dragon to keep myself staying up all night.
3087600	3088600	Right.
3088600	3089600	So-
3089600	3092160	I remember when I was younger, I literally stayed up till like 6am in the morning playing
3092160	3093720	Super Mario Brothers 2 when I first played it.
3093720	3098440	Well, I did that, though, with Final Fantasy III over here, Final Fantasy VI.
3098440	3099440	So I did that.
3099440	3101360	I did it for a week.
3101360	3103240	And then World of Warcraft.
3103240	3104240	You know, there's been-
3104240	3105240	Addict!
3105240	3108160	That raid that keeps you up later than you intended.
3108160	3110680	I mean, I'll admit it, it's happened.
3110680	3112040	Video games have impacted my sleep.
3112040	3113040	How about you, Loki?
3113040	3114040	Is the video game-
3114040	3115040	Final Fantasy XI.
3115040	3119000	Used to play with the Japanese folks, and in order to play with the Japanese guys, you
3119000	3121160	have to stay up till 5 in the morning.
3121160	3122160	I've done that before.
3122160	3123160	But-
3123160	3124160	And, uh-
3124160	3125160	I did it on purpose.
3125160	3126160	No, um, no.
3126160	3127160	But, see, that's the thing, though.
3127160	3128600	That night, that was a conscious choice.
3128600	3131800	It wasn't like, oh, games making me stay up, you know?
3131800	3136880	And I have to say, though, after I'm done gaming, fell asleep like a rock.
3136880	3140400	I mean, it did not keep me up at all.
3140400	3144560	I actually find that playing a good involving game before I go to bed, for me, works like
3144560	3146840	reading, you know?
3146840	3151200	Where it'll kind of help me settle down, because I need to be doing something before I go to
3151200	3152880	bed so that I'm not-
3152880	3157240	Because if I'm just sitting here going, buh, bored, buh, bored, buh, bored, then I won't
3157240	3158880	go to sleep.
3158880	3163480	But if I've worn my brain out, then I have no problem going to sleep.
3163480	3166440	Really when you get down to the bottom of the study, what is it that they're trying
3166440	3167440	to figure out?
3167440	3170180	They're trying to figure out whether they can blame games for something else.
3170180	3172120	I mean, that's really what it comes down to.
3172120	3176320	It's like, oh my god, violent video games are bad because they prevent you from sleeping.
3176320	3177320	I mean, really-
3177320	3181120	Because you just lie there in bed thinking about all the blood you just splattered.
3181120	3185120	You're not gonna, like, play the violent video game and go to bed and go, oh my god, someone's
3185120	3189720	gonna kill me now, unless you're, like, mentally disturbed, and in which case you shouldn't
3189720	3194680	be playing games in the first place, at least that way, and I mean, if games are affecting
3194680	3198000	you in that way, don't play them right before bed.
3198000	3201400	I mean, come on, take some damn responsibility for yourself.
3201400	3204360	We don't need to be funding the- I mean, who did this?
3204360	3209480	Obviously, it's somebody funded by somebody else, so that's money wasted right there,
3209480	3210640	if you ask me.
3210640	3213880	Let's go to our chat room with some comments and answers to the question.
3213880	3217800	Do you- have you ever, like, stayed up all night and had your sleep plans impacted by
3217800	3218800	a video game?
3218800	3223600	Shaoran says, if by impacted your sleep you mean play Final Fantasy X all night, in that
3223600	3224600	case, yeah.
3224600	3228560	Dartitsuya says, does staying up till all hours of the night playing Beat Media 2DX
3228560	3229560	count?
3229560	3231920	Bochikawa says, it has, but I've got sleep issues.
3231920	3236000	I sleep for too long and use entertainment to try to regulate hours.
3236000	3239560	Rama says, Sky, that was me with Super Mario Brothers 3 and now I'm doing it with Final
3239560	3240880	Fantasy XIII.
3240880	3244720	You know what I kind of find is that I just have a hard problem falling asleep before
3244720	3246460	midnight, period.
3246460	3250800	And I don't know if games are to really blame for that, but I just, like, I don't go to
3250800	3254560	bed before midnight ever, even if I have to be up at five in the morning, or no matter
3254560	3257280	what time I have to be up, I can't, like, force myself to go to bed before midnight.
3257280	3261040	Just force feed yourself shows that you don't want to watch, like, for example, reruns on
3261040	3262040	the Food Network.
3262040	3264400	It'll put you to sleep without you even knowing it.
3264400	3266400	But like, I don't know, I can't, like, let myself do that.
3266400	3267400	I don't know why.
3267400	3268400	I can't let myself do that either.
3268400	3269680	It's not all PM if I really want to.
3269680	3274320	But then my wife is leaning on one side, my cat's on my lap, so, you know, it's like I'm
3274320	3280280	stuck there with my eyes glued open trying to watch the same episode of Divers, or, you
3280280	3284480	know, Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and it's like, I've already seen this eight times!
3284480	3286480	I don't want to see it again.
3286480	3287480	Ah, alright.
3287480	3291600	No, but seriously though, everybody is basically saying that they made conscious choices to
3291600	3295240	stay up because the game they want to play, you know, was fun.
3295240	3298760	Not necessarily that they stopped playing and they couldn't fall asleep because they
3298760	3301520	were playing a violent video game, or a video game in general.
3301520	3306360	So once again, do we really need this study?
3306360	3311320	On the same token, I have stayed up late reading a book because I wanted to finish the book.
3311320	3313520	I wanted to get to the next chapter.
3313520	3318280	I've stayed up watching entire TV series because I wanted to see the next episode.
3318280	3321000	I wanted to see what happened next.
3321000	3322360	So it's the same thing.
3322360	3325640	I was up very late last night watching Mean Girls.
3325640	3331400	So I'm not lying, I really was up till like 1.30 because we were watching Mean Girls.
3331400	3337400	I've read books and then fell asleep and started dreaming parts of the book, like, later on,
3337400	3341940	and then had to turn in a book report and it didn't come out that well because what
3341940	3345440	I dreamt didn't actually happen in the book.
3345440	3348360	But it was funny because I didn't know that because I thought I had just been reading
3348360	3350160	the book.
3350160	3356000	Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news and then maybe we'll get some emails
3356000	3357000	on this topic.
3357000	3358000	I don't know.
3358000	3359000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3359000	3360880	I work with weirdos.
3360880	3363560	Some more news stories for you guys and then we'll get to the Classic Game of the Week
3363560	3364560	in a little bit.
3364560	3367840	Well, this is actually something that I ran across completely by accident the other day
3367840	3371280	and I'm pretty glad that I did.
3371280	3376120	There is an Iraqi video game coming out.
3376120	3379760	Developed in Iraq, took 17 years to develop.
3379760	3388120	It started developing it under Hussein's reign because it was really hard to get in the items
3388120	3390320	that they needed.
3390320	3391880	Good God, 17 years?
3391880	3393880	Is it on the ColecoVision?
3393880	3394880	1993.
3394880	3401760	Rabah Shehab was an engineering student at the University of Baghdad and after the Gulf
3401760	3404880	War he wanted to make a video game.
3404880	3413680	So he started, it was, there had been none made in Iraq so he basically decided to try
3413680	3423560	to make a fun game and he wanted to, he wanted to counter the bad images of the Gulf War,
3423560	3426580	you know, the bombs and everything by showing something that's a little bit more culturally
3426580	3428120	deep.
3428120	3438040	And so according to this he saved up to buy an Amiga in Iraq at the time and had to pirate
3438040	3443240	games so that he could actually play them and see how they were made and he actually
3443240	3450600	had to recycle floppies because he couldn't get disk drives or anything.
3450600	3453040	Doesn't he know how to copy that floppy?
3453040	3459760	Well, at any rate, they finished the game and it's about two brothers named Nasir and
3459760	3465960	Blasir who went throughout ancient Mesopotamia to fight an evil sorcerer.
3465960	3474200	And so now the game Babylonian Twins is being published for iPhone and iPod touch, or sorry,
3474200	3477680	for iPad and iPhone and I guess iPod touch.
3477680	3483960	But actually I watched some of the movie of it, the little film of it and it's actually
3483960	3484960	pretty cool.
3484960	3492120	So they basically redid the graphics all high def and added new music, new levels and it's
3492120	3495960	actually already on the iPhone so you can go get it.
3495960	3498520	And it reached the top 20 in the first week.
3498520	3499520	That's kind of neat.
3499520	3503800	You know, I really like his inspiration because I think the guy's got a really good point.
3503800	3508600	I think there's a lot of people over here, because a lot of us have practically grown
3508600	3509600	up on the Gulf War.
3509600	3513960	I mean, I know that's a weird way of saying it, but especially the demographic that listens
3513960	3518240	to this program in their 20s and stuff have known of the Gulf War since they were kids.
3518240	3524600	So I think the images we get of Iraq, unfortunately, are bombs, Saddam Hussein when they pulled
3524600	3527840	him out of the ground and he looked all like crazy.
3527840	3529760	These are the images people have of Iraq.
3529760	3539800	But there's this whole culture and years of history, a country, land that's been around
3539800	3544200	for years and years before any of this was going on and the oil wars and all this stuff
3544200	3546800	of culture that people don't really know about.
3546800	3553720	Well, I want to quote actually the last line of this article because I think that it goes
3553720	3555840	along with what you're saying.
3555840	3561720	This game is just a small creation from what he sees as a vibrant but downtrodden people
3561720	3566160	and he hopes that in America it can serve as a small indication of what Iraq is beyond
3566160	3567160	a deadly quagmire.
3567160	3570560	By the way, and by the way, of all places, I got this at AOL news.
3570560	3572560	Hey, nothing wrong with that.
3572560	3573560	Yeah.
3573560	3577240	So I'm going to link this in the chat room and I'd love for people to watch the little
3577240	3578840	trailer that came with it.
3578840	3580600	It looks super fun, actually.
3580600	3581600	I'm going to download it.
3581600	3582600	It looks kind of Mario-esque.
3582600	3587320	I'm actually going to download it on iTunes right now and I'll hopefully do a review next
3587320	3588320	week.
3588320	3589320	Very cool.
3589320	3594920	Well, props, props to that guy for, I mean, 17 years is an awfully long time and that's,
3594920	3599240	that's a lot of drive to, um, and something you really believe in.
3599240	3602520	I mean, if you think about it, we've only been doing this show, which has definitely
3602520	3605460	been a labor of love, uh, for what, eight years?
3605460	3608960	That's not even half the time it took this guy to make this game.
3608960	3610760	Just food for thought.
3610760	3614640	It's, to be fair, he didn't spend all that time making the game.
3614640	3615640	Okay.
3615640	3619460	But still, I mean, he never just let it die, right?
3619460	3620460	You know what?
3620460	3626720	It's, it's three bucks on iPhone and five bucks on the iPad, the HD version on iPad.
3626720	3627720	So you know what?
3627720	3631920	You can spend three bucks and give it a try.
3631920	3632920	All right.
3632920	3633920	We'll go look at the trailer.
3633920	3634920	See what's up your alley.
3634920	3637400	One other thing is that because he had to put, he actually put a lot of expense into
3637400	3641840	it because all this stuff was really expensive to get, you know, especially in the times
3641840	3642840	that he was in.
3642840	3647040	So he was actually quoted saying that he doesn't expect to really make back the money he spent
3647040	3649160	on it, but it would be nice.
3649160	3653120	So I, you know, help a guy out, spend the three bucks, you know, let them know that
3653120	3655440	his, you know, wasn't in vain.
3655440	3656880	All right.
3656880	3660200	Well best of luck to the guy in, um, um, selling the application and getting the word out there
3660200	3665220	that Iraq is, is much more than, than, than, than a war.
3665220	3669080	I think that's a very good, um, kind of moral, I guess, to the story.
3669080	3670080	All right.
3670080	3673920	Let's talk about some other games coming out, uh, around the world and some other, uh, parts.
3673920	3675520	We'll start here in the U.S. with Loki.
3675520	3676720	What's coming out in the U.S. this week?
3676720	3679480	Uh, not a lot, but there's some decent stuff.
3679480	3682480	Um, start off with Blood Bowl on PSP.
3682480	3687280	It's delayed from a few weeks ago, finally, hopefully coming out on, uh, PSP this week.
3687280	3692800	Uh, the Classic Controller Pro in both white and black coming out to tie in with, uh, Monster
3692800	3696640	Hunter Tri, which will be making its way out on the Wii.
3696640	3702200	Um, also All-Star Karate coming to, uh, the Wii as well.
3702200	3705640	I guess that's a little bit better than All-Star Cheerleader.
3705640	3712840	And then finally, um, Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper coming out on, uh, Xbox 360.
3712840	3719520	Also on the PlayStation Network and Xbox, um, 360 Marketplace this week, After Burner
3719520	3725360	Climax will be the game of the week.
3725360	3727960	I bet, uh, Dark Sakura's gonna, uh, check that out.
3727960	3728960	Yep.
3728960	3729960	I heard, yeah.
3729960	3730960	Damn straight.
3730960	3731960	All right.
3731960	3734800	Let's go over to Japan and look at the, uh, Japanese release dates.
3734800	3737800	Uh, a little bit busier this week than it has been in recent weeks in Japan.
3737800	3745240	Uh, coming out on the Xbox 360, Ketsuie Kizuna Jigoku Tachi Extra, uh, in regular and limited
3745240	3746480	editions on the 360.
3746480	3751200	This is a shooter classic from Cave that's getting upgraded for the 360, uh, includes
3751200	3755160	networking abilities, uh, where you can play with other people, uh, in a shooter.
3755160	3756160	So...
3756160	3757160	Cave did Eskebaloo...
3757160	3758160	Eskebaloo.
3758160	3759160	That's right.
3759160	3761860	So, uh, you shooter fans, you SHMUP fans have something to look forward to this week, um,
3761860	3763760	and I imagine some folks will be importing that.
3763760	3768760	Uh, also on the 360 this week, from Square Enix, Nier Gestalt.
3768760	3772160	And that, this is, uh, one of the ones they've been teasing for a little while, right, Nier?
3772160	3777840	Uh, is this one of the ones that's on the, um, uh, Unreal Engine, as well?
3777840	3780680	Um, maybe, I don't remember.
3780680	3785880	But it is a big new action-adventure RPG series that is coming out over here, what, by the
3785880	3786880	end of the year?
3786880	3789440	Uh, actually, it's coming out the week after next.
3789440	3792760	Oh, wow, so, good, we'll have to wait very long to get it over here.
3792760	3796080	But if you want to get it a couple weeks early, the Japanese release is out soon.
3796080	3800320	Also, uh, The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion is getting its Game of the Year edition finally
3800320	3801320	out in Japan.
3801320	3804600	It took them a little while to get Oblivion over there, because they have a translated
3804600	3805800	version, right?
3805800	3808960	And there's a lot of dialogue and so forth in Oblivion.
3808960	3812520	I mean, god, talk about a game with depth.
3812520	3815420	So they're just now getting around to their Game of the Year edition, like we've had over
3815420	3816880	here in the US for a while.
3816880	3819640	Uh, same style, same style on the PlayStation 3.
3819640	3823840	Uh, PlayStation 3 is also getting its own version of Nier, but they call it Nier Replicant
3823840	3824840	on the PS3.
3824840	3829240	It's almost like, uh, a different game on the 360 and the PS3.
3829240	3830440	I'm not sure how that all works.
3830440	3833420	Is that like a Pokemon red and blue thing, but it's on different systems?
3833420	3834420	I have no idea.
3834420	3835420	That's very interesting.
3835420	3836960	It could be a side story.
3836960	3837960	It could be.
3837960	3838960	Sometimes that happens.
3838960	3839960	That's very interesting.
3839960	3841920	You don't really usually see that in the same week though.
3841920	3843880	That's, I'm curious to see how that plays out.
3843880	3847080	Uh, the Nintendo Wii does not have any huge games this week, but they have one called
3847080	3849180	Ivy the Kiwi.
3849180	3850180	That sounds cute.
3850180	3851180	Ivy the Kiwi.
3851180	3857040	This looks a lot like, um, oh, some game I've seen on the, uh, no, I guess it's not that
3857040	3858040	same game.
3858040	3859040	Oh, it looks cute though.
3859040	3860800	I like the art style in this game.
3860800	3861800	Looks very cool.
3861800	3865920	Uh, imagine like a very hand drawn kind of game, uh, that's coming out on the Wii this
3865920	3866920	week.
3866920	3867920	I like that art style.
3867920	3869200	Google that and look at some pictures from that.
3869200	3871600	That's Ivy the Kiwi as a question.
3871600	3872600	Ivy the Kiwi?
3872600	3876440	Uh, PlayStation 2 gets another pachinko game out this week.
3876440	3880720	This one, uh, Higurashi no Naku Korom ni Matsuri, but just what you really needed.
3880720	3881720	Another pachinko game.
3881720	3882720	How about the Nintendo DS?
3882720	3887680	Nintendo DS gets its own version of Ivy the Kiwi, uh, but the big release would be Naruto,
3887680	3893800	Naruto Shippuden Ninjutsu Senkai-Cha Crash comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.
3893800	3896960	Yes, it's another Naruto game.
3896960	3898960	It's a brand new battle system though.
3898960	3906720	You fill your chakra gauge as you fight Sasuke, Itachi, or Dodara, whatever, uh, if you're
3906720	3910960	a fan of Naruto, I'm sure you already have that on import and, uh, on the PSP, actually
3910960	3915680	some big, big releases on the PSP this week, Knights in the Nightmare comes out and I think
3915680	3921960	a game that a lot of folks are going to be into on the PSP, Disgaea Infinite comes out.
3921960	3922960	That's right.
3922960	3926600	Disgaea on the PSP with infinite possibilities.
3926600	3929440	Let's go over to the UK.
3929440	3930440	Dark soccer.
3930440	3931440	I was covered in glue.
3931440	3932440	Sorry.
3932440	3933440	Still sniffing the glue over there, huh?
3933440	3938520	No, I'm working on the back end of my thing now, so I'm almost done with my decoupage.
3938520	3939520	I love that word.
3939520	3948360	Anyway, um, on the 20th we have, um, the misadventures of PB Winterbottom, and that actually makes
3948360	3954040	me sad because of one of my co-workers, except for the middle initial, those are his last
3954040	3956680	name and first initial, so it actually made me think about him.
3956680	3957680	Interesting.
3957680	3964440	I hope it doesn't have anything to do with him, um, um, and Vigilant Chronicles, an MMO.
3964440	3972000	21st Afterburner Climax, woohoo, and, um, the 23rd Dead to Rights Retribution, Monster
3972000	3977120	Hunter Tri, Nier, and the Whispered World.
3977120	3978720	That's a cool name, the Whispered World.
3978720	3979720	That's it.
3979720	3982480	That is a nice name.
3982480	3983480	Whispered World.
3983480	3984480	The Whispered World.
3984480	3985480	Whisperer.
3985480	3986480	Makes me think of Wispy Woods.
3986480	3987480	How was the stage?
3987480	3991320	Anybody know where Wispy Woods comes from?
3991320	3992320	Kirby's Avalon.
3992320	3993320	Good job!
3993320	3994320	You get a gold star.
3994320	3995320	You have that game.
3995320	3997560	When you go to the level it goes, Wispy Woods.
3997560	4001480	You are a classic game sponge, I love it.
4001480	4004320	Kirby's Avalanche was like my game until I discovered it was Puyo Puyo.
4004320	4006600	I was like, Puyo Puyo.
4006600	4010680	Kirby's Avalanche was my game and I never discovered it was Puyo Puyo until, seriously,
4010680	4014920	this show, and interacting with you and your sponge of import game knowledge.
4014920	4016840	You know what else was Puyo Puyo, right?
4016840	4017840	The Dr. Robotnik.
4017840	4019040	Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
4019040	4020040	Oh yeah.
4020040	4023900	And I think a lot of people always wondered back in the day, like, how come the same damn
4023900	4028440	game is out on the Genesis and the Nintendo, but they use the different franchises?
4028440	4030600	Like, that was kind of weird to see back then.
4030600	4031600	Anyhow.
4031600	4035040	It was just to get those games to sell in the US, just put a big game on them.
4035040	4036040	Did it work?
4036040	4037040	I think so.
4037040	4038040	I mean, the Kirby's Avalanche was great.
4038040	4039040	Yeah, it was.
4039040	4041720	And actually, the digitized voice in it was really well done.
4041720	4043720	Wispy Woods.
4043720	4046280	Anyhow.
4046280	4047280	Talk about random.
4047280	4048280	Hi, Loki.
4048280	4049280	What's on deck next?
4049280	4055160	Well, apparently the US government has asked Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to create a game
4055160	4058000	about balancing the budget.
4058000	4067160	Yes, apparently Erskine Bowles, co-chair of President Obama's fiscal commission, is trying
4067160	4068160	to...
4068160	4069160	Say that ten times faster.
4069160	4074760	Is trying to create a game to educate the public about the difficulty of reducing the
4074760	4077640	US budget deficit.
4077640	4087800	So basically, they're trying to create a game to show you that balancing the budget is hard!
4087800	4094800	And the joke, of course, goes that anybody who is able to balance the budget will immediately
4094800	4101920	be whisked away to some secret government location a la Last Starfighter to balance
4101920	4103000	the real budget.
4103000	4104640	It's budget mama.
4104640	4105640	Don't worry.
4105640	4106640	Mama will fix it.
4106640	4113560	But why spend money to say that, oh, my job is hard, I can't do this.
4113560	4116720	I mean, it just sounds like whining to me.
4116720	4117880	Budget mama for President 2012.
4117880	4121000	And the other way you can look at it is like, well, we don't know how to do it.
4121000	4122560	Do you guys have any ideas?
4122560	4124040	I mean, really?
4124040	4126900	I thought, and granted, I didn't read the story.
4126900	4131120	I just thought from looking at the title we're putting together tonight's thing, because
4131120	4132120	you know what we're talking about.
4132120	4136040	I don't like to spoil myself, because I like to kind of have topics unfold on air here.
4136040	4140660	But I kind of thought when they talked about a game about balancing the budget, I kind
4140660	4143000	of thought it would be like personal budget.
4143000	4147560	Like teach kids at a young age how to not spend more than they make and maybe like how
4147560	4150600	to save a little bit and so forth.
4150600	4154020	That would seem like the game to make, right?
4154020	4159280	Like an Oregon Trail, but with the, you know, you don't spend too much on the wagon wheels
4159280	4163880	because then you won't have enough for food unless you take a lot of guns with you because
4163880	4166440	you can shoot buffalo and have 999 pounds of food.
4166440	4172640	And in case you didn't think that, you know, the Obama campaign is out of it enough, they
4172640	4177260	thought that, you know, what you could get is support among the populace for an exceptionally
4177260	4182560	unpopular thing that you need to solve this problem.
4182560	4185280	And also saying that the game could go viral.
4185280	4186280	Wow.
4186280	4189440	Way to use buzzwords that you have no idea what the meaning are.
4189440	4193120	Like Super Chick Sisters and the other PETA games and how viral they went.
4193120	4194120	Viral.
4194120	4195120	I'm sorry.
4195120	4196360	It has to be good for it to go viral.
4196360	4198760	Well, actually it has to be popular for viral.
4198760	4202880	No, I mean joystick Kotaku and all those kids will report on it and people will play it
4202880	4206140	for like a day and then they'll be like, LOL and then never played again.
4206140	4208680	That's what happens with a lot of these, like the PETA games.
4208680	4210160	Same thing, right?
4210160	4214160	People, people look at them, play them once, go LOL and then that's it.
4214160	4218520	Honestly, I actually think that you touched on something earlier that might actually be
4218520	4219520	legitimate.
4219520	4221040	Um, Matt did.
4221040	4224680	There's also an A plus genius comment in chat I want to get to in just a minute.
4224680	4225680	Okay.
4225680	4231840	I really do think that perhaps the whole point behind this is to trick people into actually
4231840	4234280	playing it to get new ideas.
4234280	4239080	Cause seriously, it's like I put it in the same category and I'm being serious as America's
4239080	4240880	army.
4240880	4245520	You know, picking interest on who would want to be a soldier, who would want to do this,
4245520	4248140	you know, getting a realistic point of view.
4248140	4251180	This is giving a realistic point of view to people because who knows, there may be some
4251180	4255760	genius mathematician out there who might just be able to be a good advisor and do it.
4255760	4257800	Yeah, but these people are hired for this job.
4257800	4259400	This isn't like who wants to be a millionaire.
4259400	4262040	You can't fucking poll the audience for an answer.
4262040	4263880	I mean, what is going on?
4263880	4268060	Is that the previous way of doing things hasn't worked.
4268060	4271880	There's people who can't do it even though they are trained.
4271880	4274400	They're trained to think in a particular way.
4274400	4276400	So you get people who think differently.
4276400	4280720	And maybe I'm taking your comment in the wrong context and running another way in it, but
4280720	4284200	could it be then that you're saying maybe this act, I mean, I don't think this is what
4284200	4289720	you're saying, but kind of of that comment, maybe this is a way to tell kids balancing
4289720	4293140	the budget is hard and think about how you spend your own money because balancing the
4293140	4295360	government budget is next to impossible.
4295360	4296600	No that's not what it is.
4296600	4297600	No.
4297600	4300560	Well I know that's not what it is, but I think it makes sense in that light.
4300560	4306840	But seriously, I think what it is, is a way to tap an untrained mind.
4306840	4308080	You know what I mean?
4308080	4312160	You could find something, you know, because I know people who are freaking math prodigies
4312160	4317720	who don't really, aren't into the politics behind it, who would say, you know, yeah,
4317720	4319600	I'm not attached to the government office.
4319600	4325000	Here's what I would do without having to have all of those stressors of, oh, lobbyists this,
4325000	4328240	lobbyists that, we want this, we want that, we want this, we want that.
4328240	4339000	I mean, keep in mind the benefit of getting an, I would have to say an unfiltered perspective.
4339000	4343880	Getting fresh eyes to look at something, I mean, that is legitimately a unique way of
4343880	4344880	doing it.
4344880	4348560	I mean, it's one thing to just go out and pull a bunch of people who you know to be
4348560	4353440	talented in it, but another thing to put it out under the pretenses of a game and let
4353440	4357960	people work on it without having a real attachment to it and see what creative solution they
4357960	4359440	come up with.
4359440	4360920	A better sim would be for them.
4360920	4363320	It's so crazy, Jamie, it might be true.
4363320	4366480	Like that's my thought.
4366480	4370080	And again, keep, keep in mind, keep in mind, I, I'm coming from the point of view where
4370080	4374320	a, okay, keep, and the design point of view, let's put it this way.
4374320	4378320	You've got all these people who are trained to do, oh, we use Helvetica for this, we do
4378320	4380280	Swiss design, we do this, we do that.
4380280	4387300	The FedEx logo was created by an intern, you know, just some new kid who came in.
4387300	4388300	So think about that.
4388300	4394160	You know, you get that fresh perspective, you get someone who's not bogged down by just
4394160	4400640	the weight of the industry, you know, in this case by the weight of politics.
4400640	4401640	Where could they go?
4401640	4405640	Ironically enough, I don't like talking about my day job a lot on this show, but I know,
4405640	4409500	you know, I did mention I just started a new day job this past week actually.
4409500	4412980	And I think part of what they're looking for me to me to bring to this position is a fresh
4412980	4413980	perspective.
4413980	4417240	That's a, that's a big part of like, you know, why I'm doing the job I'm doing.
4417240	4419080	So it's interesting that you kind of tie that together.
4419080	4423000	Well, if they want a fresh perspective, vote these people out of office.
4423000	4426440	These people were not voted into their job.
4426440	4427440	They were elected.
4427440	4432240	Well, we can take care, we can take care of the people that put them there.
4432240	4433920	I really think you're completely missing the point.
4433920	4438640	But I worry that the people that would jump up and say, I'll do the job instead are not
4438640	4440440	the ones that should be doing it either.
4440440	4441440	You know what I mean?
4441440	4446400	I'm looking at this as a consultant, someone who will provide the fresh perspective, someone
4446400	4451880	who will give the ideas and then let the people who are trained, who see the big picture actually
4451880	4452880	run with it.
4452880	4453880	I think it's brilliant, honestly.
4453880	4455680	I really do think it's very intelligent.
4455680	4461640	And I'm, you know, especially if our president is backing, supports the idea, then I'm very
4461640	4462640	glad I voted for him.
4462640	4466120	Well, just so you guys know, it isn't the first time that they've tried this.
4466120	4471560	Apparently in 1989, the National Economic Commission distributed hard choices on floppies
4471560	4474400	for $20 a copy.
4474400	4483840	And apparently also the 1994 Commission also released a game with the title Budget Shadows.
4483840	4485480	And budget shadows.
4485480	4491920	And unfortunately, even though those games were released, we still don't have a balanced
4491920	4492920	budget.
4492920	4493920	OK.
4493920	4495160	How many of you got total random tangent?
4495160	4496160	But quick poll in studio.
4496160	4498040	How many of you guys watch Channel 6 KVIE?
4498040	4500320	How many guys watch Channel 6?
4500320	4501320	I have.
4501320	4502320	What if it's not Channel 6?
4502320	4504360	I know this is a Sacramento reference, but whatever.
4504360	4505360	It's KVIE.
4505360	4506360	KVIE.
4506360	4507360	The PBS.
4507360	4508960	How many guys ever watch that?
4508960	4509960	I have.
4509960	4510960	I have two.
4510960	4513560	They show some neat things once in a while on PBS, actually, besides just Sesame Street
4513560	4514560	and Mr. Rogers.
4514560	4515560	We were bored one night.
4515560	4516560	Extremely bored.
4516560	4517560	And high.
4517560	4518560	And there was nothing.
4518560	4519560	No, not high.
4519560	4520560	We were so bored.
4520560	4523400	And the only thing it was on was a Michael Bolton concert.
4523400	4528800	And it was like, I don't want to watch this, but seriously, it is the only thing on TV
4528800	4529800	right now.
4529800	4532400	Hey, well, actually we had a story a couple weeks ago about how Video Games Live was doing
4532400	4534040	a thing for PBS.
4534040	4536280	That would have been way better than the Michael Bolton concert.
4536280	4539440	I saw a Lorena McKinnon concert that was filmed for PBS that was amazing.
4539440	4540440	It was amazing.
4540440	4544520	Although I have to say props to them for being one of the first to have HD.
4544520	4545520	So you know.
4545520	4549560	PBS introduced me to Doctor Who when I was a child.
4549560	4553200	Well, the reason why I bring that up, and I'm not just saying this comment is great
4553200	4557480	because it's from a friend of mine, but Sagonar Chatroom says, this is why I need to start
4557480	4560000	the Corporation for Public Gaming.
4560000	4563800	I always found that there was a need for journalistic game development in the vein of the persuasive
4563800	4564800	games.
4564800	4569040	So while I like the idea of having a budget balance game, but this isn't quite the most
4569040	4571320	productive path to make an effective title.
4571320	4577520	And there's a part of me that goes, why isn't there a foundation for public gaming, a corporation
4577520	4579660	like there is for PBS?
4579660	4582560	This Jazz Jackrabbit was brought to you by...
4582560	4583560	Well.
4583560	4584560	Yeah.
4584560	4585560	Why not?
4585560	4586560	I agree.
4586560	4587560	Isn't it weird?
4587560	4591160	But I think there's Flash games that are like that, aren't there?
4591160	4593000	It's different.
4593000	4597760	And maybe television is different than like Xbox and Wii and all this, but certainly like
4597760	4599640	maybe PC games.
4599640	4606240	It is a little interesting that we don't have more of a, I guess publicly funded game development
4606240	4607240	thing.
4607240	4609240	Although I guess maybe that's part of what Loki's talking about.
4609240	4610240	I don't know.
4610240	4611240	It's very interesting.
4611240	4615040	I just thought, I just kind of read that comment and I went, huh, that's a really good point.
4615040	4617720	How come they have it for TV if they don't have it for games?
4617720	4618720	Hmm.
4618720	4619720	Interesting.
4619720	4623560	Anyhow, we've got a couple more stories here and then we're going to get to the classic
4623560	4624560	game of the week.
4624560	4627760	Uh, I want to talk about Xbox live and crime.
4627760	4629160	Do, do, do, do, do.
4629160	4630800	Uh, here's the deal.
4630800	4634240	What happened is that there was a Connecticut man, just 23 years old, he was out on bail.
4634240	4638400	I guess he had been arrested for gun charges, drug charges, you know, all that type of shady
4638400	4639400	stuff.
4639400	4642480	Apparently he got re-arrested even though he was out on bail.
4642480	4643480	Why?
4643480	4648040	He sent threatening messages to witnesses on Xbox live.
4648040	4652880	This all according to the New Haven Connecticut register, uh, Anthony Hayward is his name
4652880	4659320	and he sent an Xbox live message to one of the witnesses that says, rats die slow.
4659320	4661160	And it included the witnesses home address.
4661160	4663360	This was back in December, but you know, things take time.
4663360	4664600	Can we give him a stupid award?
4664600	4665600	Uh, we could.
4665600	4669880	You know, what's funny though is that could just be regular Xbox live dialogue if you
4669880	4670880	ask me.
4670880	4672280	I mean, he might not have actually been there.
4672280	4674560	I was just playing call of duty officer.
4674560	4675560	Seriously.
4675560	4681800	This is dark soccer is talking about the stupid award, uh, by the way, uh, just so you know,
4681800	4683280	he had been arrested last summer.
4683280	4687000	Uh, there was a stolen gun under the passenger seat of the car he was driving.
4687000	4690520	Uh, apparently the witness said he placed it there.
4690520	4692800	He surrendered himself to police.
4692800	4697240	He was charged with witness tampering, intimidating the witness and two counts of second degree
4697240	4698240	harassment.
4698240	4702120	The judge set the bail for $50,000.
4702120	4714160	Idiot, I gotta say though, Xbox live, you know, you don't, it's just another medium
4714160	4716360	now it's just as easy as writing an email or whatever.
4716360	4717360	All right.
4717360	4720240	Dark soccer has got one more story for us and then the classic game of the week.
4720240	4721240	Dark soccer.
4721240	4722240	Oh yeah.
4722240	4725820	So, um, you remember me telling you a long time ago about playing descent and having
4725820	4729680	to have it on 14 discs back in the day?
4729680	4730680	Yes.
4730680	4733760	She had to install three and a half inch floppies, she had to install like 14 disc.
4733760	4734760	Please insert this too.
4734760	4735760	Please insert this three.
4735760	4736760	Yes.
4736760	4739120	And my friend who actually I've reconnected with on Facebook recently, my friend Avery,
4739120	4743800	um, he built a, he, he modified a chair for descent.
4743800	4745520	I thought it was pretty cool.
4745520	4746840	It was Uber.
4746840	4747840	Awesome.
4747840	4749520	Like did the chair move as descent?
4749520	4753480	No, but he had like joysticks rigged and key pads and stuff.
4753480	4754480	Okay.
4754480	4756000	I wonder if he still has it.
4756000	4757000	Anyway.
4757000	4762440	So Interplay is actually going to be bringing descent to WiiWare and, um, it's being developed
4762440	4771000	by G1M2 and, um, we'll be using the Wiimote, um, to, uh, move in the game.
4771000	4772000	That's going to be interesting.
4772000	4776880	I, I got to tell you, if you have a hard time conceptualizing 3d in your mind, like I know
4776880	4780280	a lot of us did when we had to move from 2d to 3d gaming, like part of the reason I struggle
4780280	4784240	with Metroid is I can't imagine like just conceptualizing it all in 3d is kind of hard
4784240	4789760	sometimes like descent will seriously like mess with your mind so hard because it is
4789760	4795440	full 360 degree movement, but basically, um, well, you know how hard it was to control
4795440	4796440	the keyboard.
4796440	4797440	I mean, it was a pain in the ass.
4797440	4798440	Right.
4798440	4802780	And it wasn't that it was a little bit easier with joysticks, but, but all of your movement
4802780	4805660	then is just going to be intuitive moving through.
4805660	4806660	You don't have a button.
4806660	4808400	It's just moving the sticks.
4808400	4809400	So interesting.
4809400	4815280	And here's what I would propose the reversal head tracking mode.
4815280	4820600	Could you imagine playing this as a head tracking game, crazy hearing around corners, moving
4820600	4823800	forward, backing up.
4823800	4824800	That would be crazy.
4824800	4825800	Go nuts.
4825800	4826800	Too bad.
4826800	4827800	It's not going to happen.
4827800	4828800	Nope.
4828800	4829800	You know, actually it kind of related to that.
4829800	4834400	Did you happen to see the link that I put up on my Facebook about the, um, the interactive
4834400	4836400	windows?
4836400	4837720	I don't think so.
4837720	4842240	These, these people, and I'll try to find the article again, but these people, um, made
4842240	4847880	a wall facade and put up windows in it with actually two, um, plasma monitors and, uh,
4847880	4850680	uh, uh, Mac.
4850680	4855720	And um, they did the we moat hack to, and then had like this, a sensor board that you
4855720	4859440	could wear around your neck and it would head track the window so you could go to the windows
4859440	4863760	and peer through them and go around and, um, oh, sorry, the poltergeist are attacking my
4863760	4864760	room again.
4864760	4867760	Um, but you could peer in the windows and everything.
4867760	4872720	I really, really think that that should be where those kinds of games go.
4872720	4873720	Hmm.
4873720	4875640	Well, will you get, will you check this out?
4875640	4877960	I'd throw up, but I think it'd be funny.
4877960	4879880	Will you check this out on WiiWare when it comes out?
4879880	4880880	Probably.
4880880	4881880	Yeah.
4881880	4882880	Although I really, and I didn't-
4882880	4883880	Did they name a price?
4883880	4884880	Or a little early for that?
4884880	4885880	Let's see.
4885880	4886880	Mm-hmm.
4886880	4887880	Might be a little early for that.
4887880	4888880	Yeah, I think it's too early for that.
4888880	4892040	But, um, I, I, what I would really like to see though with that is I soup, I hope it's
4892040	4898560	not pixel like it was, I would really like for them to at least just clean up the pixels
4898560	4899560	in it.
4899560	4900560	They might.
4900560	4901560	Or render it.
4901560	4902560	Shit.
4902560	4903560	I mean.
4903560	4908480	Um, before we get into the next segment here, I just want to quickly ask DarkSakura a question
4908480	4910040	from a chatter here.
4910040	4914200	Fun ET man in chat says, good night, but a quick question for DarkSakura.
4914200	4919360	Which Puyo Puyo is the best for being the most easily obtainable?
4919360	4921880	An actual Puyo Puyo?
4921880	4922880	I'm sure-
4922880	4923880	DS.
4923880	4924880	Puyo Puyo DS, probably.
4924880	4925880	Well, for the US, yeah.
4925880	4929280	I would say you can get, um, Puyo Pop.
4929280	4930280	Whatever that one was.
4930280	4932580	Wasn't there a Puyo Party or something?
4932580	4935600	There was just a game called Puyo Puyo DS that came out when the DS first came out.
4935600	4936600	Yeah, you can-
4936600	4937600	It's probably really easy to get and cheap now.
4937600	4938600	Probably.
4938600	4941120	Um, I, I, but Puyo Pop, you can just get that anywhere.
4941120	4947760	Um, and it came out on, um, DS and I've actually got a Puyo Puyo that came out on Neo Geo Pocket
4947760	4949280	Color a while back.
4949280	4952760	If you're looking for an import, though, I don't know.
4952760	4961080	I got, I have, uh, um, the PC Engine Duo version, which my friend picked up for, you know, 900
4961080	4962080	yen in Japan.
4962080	4965940	I'm not supposed to tell you this, but just go get a Super Nintendo emulator and download
4965940	4968940	Kirby's Avalanche.
4968940	4969940	Kirby's Avalanche!
4969940	4970940	I didn't tell you that.
4970940	4971940	It's also supported in MAME, too, by the way.
4971940	4972940	Oh, is it?
4972940	4973940	Yeah.
4973940	4974940	It's good to know.
4974940	4979200	But, there's, like, all kinds of versions, like, Nintendo 64 had a version, Saturn had,
4979200	4984280	um, I think Puyo Puyo Sun, which is actually one I'm still looking for.
4984280	4986760	That's a game I'm actually looking for, is Puyo Puyo Sun.
4986760	4990520	Actually, and to be fair, maybe I shouldn't endorse the whole emulator thing, there, I
4990520	4995160	believe Robotnik's Mean Beaten Machine is all over those Sega collections.
4995160	4997080	It's tucked away on a lot of the Sonic ones.
4997080	5003320	But, uh, I'm, in fact, I'm positive it's on the Mega, uh, Sonic's Genesis Collection game
5003320	5007220	that came out a couple, like, last year, uh, and that's a great deal, because that game
5007220	5012520	was only, like, what, 20 bucks, and it's, like, 30, 40 Genesis games, it's, it's, and
5012520	5014880	some arcade games, uh, and Mean Beaten Machine is one of them.
5014880	5015880	So cheap now.
5015880	5019240	Oh, it's, uh, that is, seriously, that's an awesome buy.
5019240	5020240	It really is.
5020240	5021240	It's super fun.
5021240	5025840	Especially for you younger guys, who, and gals, who didn't kind of grow up experiencing
5025840	5027960	Genesis like, like we did.
5027960	5031520	And there's also some actually pretty fun achievements in it, but you unlock your games,
5031520	5034000	too, by getting certain scores on some of the crappier games.
5034000	5035000	Yeah.
5035000	5036000	Good times.
5036000	5037000	Yeah.
5037000	5038000	Okay.
5038000	5040600	Um, see, see, see how much this woman knows about her classic gaming?
5040600	5043640	That's why she gets a segment every week on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.
5043640	5044640	Oh, by the way.
5044640	5045640	Huh?
5045640	5049880	Puyo Puyo 64 was a four player, was a four player Puyo Puyo C. Can you tell me who that
5049880	5050880	was?
5050880	5051880	See what I mean?
5051880	5052880	She just, she knows her shit.
5052880	5055440	So, uh, every week on this show, Dark Sakura dives into the vault and, uh, picks out a
5055440	5060400	classic game that she thinks you all should be playing this week, right now.
5060400	5063240	She was to edumacate you on a classic game.
5063240	5065160	It's called Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.
5065160	5068040	Dark Sakura, what could the Classic Game of the Week possibly be?
5068040	5070240	It's Descent.
5070240	5072120	What a crazy coincidence.
5072120	5074440	What made you, what made you decide to pick it this week?
5074440	5076120	Uh, because I felt like it.
5076120	5078120	It was either that or Microcosm.
5078120	5079120	Maybe next week.
5079120	5080120	Maybe.
5080120	5082400	Alright, well this is, it's certainly worthy of being the Game of the Week and even, you
5082400	5085920	know, it just, it ties into the news, certainly, but I think there's a lot of people that miss
5085920	5086920	this game.
5086920	5087920	Yep.
5087920	5088920	So tell us about Descent, Dark Sakura.
5088920	5093680	So you go throughout the solar system from the moon to, uh, Pluto's moon, Charon, and
5093680	5097320	then you beat a boss robot, but then you can't go home.
5097320	5102880	Um, but yeah, all these infected robots, you have to shoot them and then stop the main
5102880	5104360	robot, blah, blah, blah.
5104360	5107760	Um, this is actually one of the games that made me really motion sick.
5107760	5117680	For, it was, um, it used, um, a wireframe map, but, um, it was only, like, around your
5117680	5124360	absolute position, so you, you know, as you'd move through it, it was, it, it's really hard
5124360	5125360	to describe.
5125360	5130160	And also, the thing that actually made me really motion sick about this one is that
5130160	5132720	you seem to always be tilting.
5132720	5137380	I mean, I'm not the only one who saw that, right?
5137380	5138560	So anyway, um.
5138560	5140520	I would play it spinning all the time.
5140520	5142960	I was in a constant barrel roll.
5142960	5146800	I could, I had a hard ass time controlling it.
5146800	5157760	Um, but, um, it was, it was actually, um, one of the, I think, harder games too.
5157760	5162120	It was real, it was a full 3D environment.
5162120	5169840	You had to increase your speed while using acceleration controls and, uh, directional
5169840	5171920	controls and different stuff.
5171920	5176400	You had to pretty much multitask the entire time you were playing.
5176400	5177400	So that was pretty difficult.
5177400	5184560	Um, it did have an 8-player LAN mode, um, and then, um, actually, I think there's even
5184560	5186280	still Descent servers up today.
5186280	5193320	Um, Descent 2, um, was, uh, actually supposed to be pretty much okay online too.
5193320	5200080	Um, there were 27 levels, um, in, and 3 secret levels in the first Descent.
5200080	5209120	You had, like, some of them were the moon, um, Venus, Mercury, um, parts of Mars, uh,
5209120	5214600	moons on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, blah, blah, blah.
5214600	5219240	Um, so you would just show up in your different location when you started and you would have
5219240	5222560	your, um, shield energy, which was like your life.
5222560	5229640	Um, but you could, um, only, um, restore your shield through power-ups and it would only
5229640	5231280	go up to 200%.
5231280	5237280	Um, and if you finished the mission below 100%, your shield's charged to 100%, but on
5237280	5240440	the, but if you were above 100%, then it would stay where it was.
5240440	5244440	Like, if you were at 120, it would be at 120 when you start off.
5244440	5249880	Um, and you did have limited lives, unlimited in multiplayer, um, and when you respawn,
5249880	5251880	you start from the beginning, the beginning of the level.
5251880	5254240	So it was pretty, kind of crazy.
5254240	5265280	Um, it was originally DOS, um, for 386 PCs, uh, 33 megahertz, um, you play it on something,
5265280	5268960	you know, now, of course, it's gonna play like a dream, you know, if you can, of course,
5268960	5269960	find this doctor.
5269960	5273680	Yeah, you're gonna have to use one of those programs to slow, like, it would be too fast,
5273680	5275680	yeah, like a DOS emulator.
5275680	5279120	Um, there is a port- Or wait for WiiWare.
5279120	5280120	Yeah.
5280120	5285440	Um, there is a, uh, port for, uh, PlayStation, and there was one planned for Saturn that
5285440	5287160	never was released.
5287160	5292520	Um, so yeah, you can get, um, there's a shareware version of 94 that came out after Doom came
5292520	5303640	out, um, and you'd, like, we were saying you have to use a software renderer, um, but,
5303640	5309280	um, other than that, it was just, it- Just be prepared for a trip, because you gotta
5309280	5314120	fly upside down and all this stuff, you know, it's full 360 degrees, I mean, what's- The
5314120	5318360	way I kind of think of this game is it's, like, Doom without gravity, you know?
5318360	5319360	Yeah.
5319360	5323520	Well, and on top of that, the one thing that you're having to do is that the texture mapping,
5323520	5330000	um, goes every 32 pixels, so you deal with a lot of pop-up, especially if you're, actually,
5330000	5336440	if you don't have things set to emulate it just right, you know what I mean?
5336440	5337440	Mm-hmm.
5337440	5342160	And, um, the, uh, engine used for it is a, uh, portal rendering engine, so that, um,
5342160	5349680	you could connect different sectors, so, uh, that was pretty cool, um, and they've actually,
5349680	5355640	um, released the, uh, source code without the audio in 97, and actually the source code
5355640	5357240	for Descent 2 was released in 99.
5357240	5358240	Oh, wow.
5358240	5364280	So different expansions out, there's the Descent Mission Builder, uh, 95, uh, there was Descent
5364280	5370040	Levels of the World 95, Descent Anniversary Edition that had all the other add-ons, and
5370040	5374040	the extra levels that Parallax made, Descent on PlayStation, and Descent on WiiWare that's
5374040	5375640	coming out this fall.
5375640	5381360	Um, as far as anything that's related to, there was Descent Under Mountain, which was
5381360	5386760	an RPG that used the Descent Graphics engine, um, but wasn't really in it, and then there
5386760	5389560	was the clone Forsaken, do you remember that?
5389560	5391760	Yes, I do.
5391760	5392760	Was that the one that had the commercial?
5392760	5393760	Yeah.
5393760	5394760	The future's forsaken.
5394760	5396480	Yes, I remember that game.
5396480	5402640	And then, um, Descent Free Space The Great War was put out, um, by Volition in 98, but
5402640	5405520	it wasn't really a Descent game, I just shared the name.
5405520	5411400	Um, Volition was working on Descent 4, but it was cancelled in, um, 2000 because Descent
5411400	5417280	3 didn't sell that well, so, but it served as the basis for Red Faction.
5417280	5418280	Interesting.
5418280	5419280	So.
5419280	5420280	Alright.
5420280	5421280	That's it.
5421280	5425480	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5425480	5426920	I can't believe it, it's not Sega.
5426920	5427920	That's alright, no.
5427920	5428920	Hey!
5428920	5429920	No, it's a good game, this is a great pick.
5429920	5432520	I felt it was appropriate.
5432520	5434080	It's very, uh, news appropriate.
5434080	5435080	I love it.
5435080	5436080	So fair.
5436080	5438360	And it's a game I really enjoy, and I actually remember this one.
5438360	5440320	Oh god, this game made me so motion sick.
5440320	5442760	You know when I was saying that the Pixel ones never did?
5442760	5443760	This one actually?
5443760	5445680	Well it was really rudimentary 3D rendered.
5445680	5449440	It really was, it wasn't so sprite based, it was like, it really was 3D rendered.
5449440	5451760	It kind of looks like Mode 7 Hell.
5451760	5452760	Yeah.
5452760	5454400	Well except not as blurry.
5454400	5455400	Yeah.
5455400	5458880	But yeah, even watching it on YouTube is like, ugh.
5458880	5459880	Blur.
5459880	5460880	Alright.
5460880	5461880	There it is.
5461880	5464560	But do you not see what I mean by it feels like you're tilting all the time?
5464560	5468240	No, and the full 360 motion is kind of hell on the brain.
5468240	5469240	I get what you're saying.
5469240	5470240	Oh, yeah.
5470240	5471240	Alright.
5471240	5474000	Well we got plenty more coming up when we come back from a quick break here at Orange
5474000	5475000	Laundry Radio.
5475000	5476000	We're only halfway done if even that.
5476000	5479520	We're going to talk about some moving and shaking going on on the PlayStation Network.
5479520	5484080	We're going to talk about arcades, a major arcade chain going through some big changes.
5484080	5489240	And Capcom, apparently some big, big news leaking out of Capcom.
5489240	5491260	Someone's breaking embargo.
5491260	5494880	We will talk a little bit about that a little later on in the show.
5494880	5495880	But yeah, stay tuned.
5495880	5505360	We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5505360	5511000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, April the 18th of 2010.
5511000	5514600	It should be noted that it is the night before dark.
5514600	5515600	Sakura's birthday.
5515600	5516600	Birthday, birthday, birthday.
5516600	5517600	Yep.
5517600	5518800	So I'm doing whatever I want.
5518800	5519800	So happy birthday.
5519800	5520800	Early birthday.
5520800	5521800	Do you have to work tomorrow?
5521800	5522800	No.
5522800	5523800	I don't.
5523800	5524800	I asked for tomorrow off.
5524800	5525800	Nice.
5525800	5526800	That's the best birthday present you could possibly give yourself.
5526800	5527800	But guess what I have to do?
5527800	5528800	What?
5528800	5529800	Hang out at DMV.
5529800	5530800	Uh-oh.
5530800	5531800	Is tomorrow the day your license expires?
5531800	5533800	And I didn't schedule an appointment.
5533800	5534800	No.
5534800	5535800	No.
5535800	5539720	The thing that I was working on when you got here has been eating all my time.
5539720	5540720	Oh, I see.
5540720	5541720	That, and I was sick.
5541720	5542720	Sick.
5542720	5543720	That's a bummer.
5543720	5544720	Yeah.
5544720	5545720	I feel a lot better now.
5545720	5546720	Well, how do you feel about-
5546720	5547720	How about me smelling glue?
5547720	5550560	How do you feel about turning 21?
5550560	5554200	And now you'll actually be able to drink legally?
5554200	5555200	Just kidding.
5555200	5556200	All right.
5556200	5560680	You know, whoever guesses my age, if they shut up, then I will give them a prize.
5560680	5561680	All right.
5561680	5562680	I actually, you know what?
5562680	5563680	You know what?
5563680	5564680	I don't care if people know how old I am.
5564680	5565680	Okay.
5565680	5566680	You know how old I am?
5566680	5567680	How old?
5567680	5571240	I will be, as of 2 a.m., 34.
5571240	5572240	Congratulations.
5572240	5573240	34 years young.
5573240	5576120	34, and I still get carded for DVDs.
5576120	5577120	Rock.
5577120	5579120	There you go.
5579120	5585000	So, and I have to say, for all of you people who were in your late teens and 20s and are
5585000	5586000	whining, shut up.
5586000	5587440	It gets better at 30.
5587440	5588440	It really does.
5588440	5589440	It really does.
5589440	5591360	I was really dreading 30, but 30 has been awesome.
5591360	5592360	So far.
5592360	5593360	Seriously.
5593360	5594360	So far.
5594360	5595360	It's like-
5595360	5596360	Did you hear that, Loki?
5596360	5597360	Life gets better at 30.
5597360	5598360	How do you feel about that?
5598360	5599360	Loki's not 30 yet.
5599360	5600360	He shrugs.
5600360	5601360	Almost there.
5601360	5602360	Yeah.
5602360	5605800	Well, I mean, because it's sort of like you hit this level, like right when you were in
5605800	5611360	your early 30s, that's like all this little drama crap stops mattering.
5611360	5614800	Like, why was I worried about that?
5614800	5617240	Why do I care?
5617240	5619460	And it's like, okay.
5619460	5620460	So right.
5620460	5621920	The least that has to happen with me.
5621920	5623720	I stopped caring.
5623720	5624720	I don't know.
5624720	5627480	For me, I just found I got laid more in my 30s than I did in my 20s.
5627480	5628480	You know?
5628480	5629480	Just saying.
5629480	5630480	I'm kidding.
5630480	5631480	I'm kidding.
5631480	5632480	No, I'm not.
5632480	5633480	All right.
5633480	5638240	I just want to wake people up and make sure people are really paying attention.
5638240	5639240	All right.
5639240	5641600	And there's, oh, everybody in chat is saying like, oh, I'm 27.
5641600	5642600	I'm 31.
5642600	5643600	I'm 23.
5643600	5644600	There you go.
5644600	5645600	I'm waiting.
5645600	5648000	I'm waiting for, where's, where's the, like, uh, God, don't we have like a 14 year old
5648000	5649000	that listens?
5649000	5650000	Cheeseburger.
5650000	5651000	How's cheeseburger?
5651000	5652000	Cheeseburger.
5652000	5653000	I think it's 15 now.
5653000	5654000	I think it's 14.
5654000	5655800	I was like, oh my gosh, your parents know what you're doing.
5655800	5656800	And then now what?
5656800	5657800	DS master's really young too, isn't he?
5657800	5658800	Yeah.
5658800	5659800	But you know what?
5659800	5660800	It's all good.
5660800	5663200	Well, and you know, and the reason I can, I can actually get away with saying this because
5663200	5668880	no matter how much you deny the whole, oh, I'm too old for the drama stuff when you're
5668880	5669880	in your twenties.
5669880	5672920	No, it still bites you.
5672920	5674600	I thought I was over it.
5674600	5676200	You're only as old as you feel.
5676200	5679600	Age ain't nothing but a number and a biological function.
5679600	5680600	All right.
5680600	5681600	Anyhow.
5681600	5683640	So let's get into some, uh, gaming news back to game news.
5683640	5684640	Uh, Loki.
5684640	5685640	Yes.
5685640	5686920	Quick, quick stuff.
5686920	5691600	A lot of, actually, believe it or not, I had a hard time kind of picking and choosing the
5691600	5694440	stories for tonight because there was actually a lot of good stuff to talk about.
5694440	5697080	So some of the stuff that we really should be spending like a long time talking about
5697080	5698600	got pushed to this segment.
5698600	5700920	So some quick stuff tonight.
5700920	5701920	Yeah.
5701920	5705280	So, uh, the PlayStation move, you may remember it has a controller.
5705280	5708800	That's sort of like the nunchuck, but not the nunchuck.
5708800	5716040	Well, anyways, um, this was recently discovered in FCC, um, trademark that the new controller
5716040	5718520	will be called the navigation controller.
5718520	5727800	So the navigation controller to the Sony move will be what the nunchuck is to the Wii remote.
5727800	5728800	Awesome.
5728800	5736280	Uh, and then apparently Lost Planet 2 is getting some more, um, secret guest characters that
5736280	5741080	you'll be able to, um, play as, including a man who has covered wars.
5741080	5748520	Uh, Frank West will be returning from Dead Rising, including a giant teddy bear backpack
5748520	5751160	that he will be, um, I guess carrying.
5751160	5757080	It's kind of really cute how the teddy bear holds his extra, you know, assault rifle.
5757080	5758840	Um, that's neat.
5758840	5763040	And then of course, um, there's going to be a guy from Monster Hunter as well.
5763040	5770160	Um, they're referring to him as the scaly knife gun dude, but, um, that's pretty cool
5770160	5775440	that they have all these, I love the fact that they gave Frank West to teddy bear, all
5775440	5781620	the Frank West and the mega man outfit would have been a plus, just saying, well, Hey,
5781620	5782620	we can dream.
5782620	5785560	Maybe they'll have alternate costumes or something later on, by the way, just real quick.
5785560	5789080	I don't mean to derail you low key, but I had to issue a correction here because this
5789080	5790640	is very important.
5790640	5794200	Cheeseburger is actually in chat right now wants to clarify he turned 16 on Valentine's
5794200	5798000	day, but he's been listening to OLR for four years.
5798000	5802960	So you do the math and I'm just like, Oh my God.
5802960	5808560	But then again, you know what, when I was 12 when I was your age cheeseburger, Oh God,
5808560	5809560	I'm that guy.
5809560	5815640	No, but for real, I was calling into BBSs on my modem when I was 12 and posting on message
5815640	5819600	forums and talking about tons of shit I a 12 year old shouldn't be like reading or talking
5819600	5820600	about.
5820600	5827040	But all I have to, I, I just hope your parents know it's an R rated show, but I don't think
5827040	5828600	we're a bad influence.
5828600	5832600	I like to think we teach you, you know, how to think for yourself and how to, uh, how
5832600	5834600	to write, write proper emails.
5834600	5835600	Yes.
5835600	5836600	You've got your grant.
5836600	5848560	Seriously, you've got politics, nutrition, um, speech, debate and grammar and hand-eye
5848560	5851000	coordination above all from video games.
5851000	5852000	All right.
5852000	5853000	Anyhow.
5853000	5854000	Sorry, Loki.
5854000	5855000	All right.
5855000	5861320	And then, um, other fun stuff we can be talking about here, of course, um, pillow fight girls,
5861320	5865200	a game that will be coming to the iPhone very soon.
5865200	5872320	And um, it features scanly clad women and having pillow fights.
5872320	5877760	Apparently it will be a lot of people actually, apparently it'll be a reprise of the 2007
5877760	5885760	Java hit sexy girls, but of course getting the more PG 13 rated, um, title pillow fight
5885760	5886760	girls.
5886760	5887760	Yeah.
5887760	5891760	Well that's because, uh, didn't, uh, Apple crack down on a lot of those borderline porn,
5891760	5893600	the soft core titles, if you will.
5893600	5894600	Yes.
5894600	5897640	But, uh, they are scanly clad and well endowed.
5897640	5901280	Well, there you go.
5901280	5902280	All right.
5902280	5903280	Pillow fight girls.
5903280	5907120	In other words, half naked and big boobed.
5907120	5910320	That's the more, I guess that was a politically correct way of saying, I don't like to be
5910320	5911320	politically correct.
5911320	5912320	I know you don't.
5912320	5918280	Another thing she teaches on this show, how to say it plain, uh, a little big planet too
5918280	5920160	might've been inadvertently confirmed.
5920160	5925680	Uh, that's because musician Christopher Leary, who go by, who goes by the pseudonym Ochere
5925680	5927280	announced on his Twitter.
5927280	5928280	Here we go.
5928280	5929280	Twitter breaking the news.
5929280	5934360	Again, his song infotain me has been licensed to Sony for little big planet too.
5934360	5938520	This is not the first time it's been accidentally mentioned that little big planet too exists.
5938520	5940720	Here's a clip by the way, what this song sounds like.
5940720	5949760	Let me skip in a little ways here and hearing this, it does sound very little big planet.
5949760	5952600	I could see this in like a watery level or something.
5952600	5957360	Well, here's the thing too, everyone's like, Oh my God, they're doing a sequel.
5957360	5962760	It could very well just be a big old dialogue content pet that they do and add like a whole
5962760	5966520	new story mode with levels and stuff because they've already said they're not doing a sequel,
5966520	5970040	but it doesn't mean they can't release a new level pack that basically has an entirely
5970040	5973120	new storyline to go with it with new features.
5973120	5975520	I think they could do a sequel.
5975520	5977640	They could get away with it and not look like jerks.
5977640	5983220	I think they've supported the first one so well that they honestly, the paintball gun,
5983220	5988640	the water, all of that could have been a sequel and I think they would have been able to justify
5988640	5992400	having that and selling, you know, the game for 40 bucks or whatever.
5992400	5996640	But uh, you know, I, if they're doing a true sequel with all new media molecule levels
5996640	5998960	and a couple of new elements, who knows what will be in it.
5998960	5999960	I think it's okay.
5999960	6003440	I'm not going to get mad at him for saying before they weren't going to do a sequel because
6003440	6004480	you know what?
6004480	6006840	I think they resisted the temptation long enough.
6006840	6011080	But again, I would hope that there's enough here to really justify that big two in front
6011080	6012080	of it.
6012080	6016040	But, um, I, you know, media molecule really didn't disappoint with the first game.
6016040	6020240	I have faith, but maybe that's just me.
6020240	6022480	Are you saying you would not support a little big planet to Loki?
6022480	6023480	No, sure.
6023480	6024480	I'd pick it up.
6024480	6025480	It was awesome.
6025480	6026480	I would too.
6026480	6027480	It was my favorite game in the year it came out.
6027480	6028480	So, all right.
6028480	6029480	This, uh, it might be a worth picking up too.
6029480	6030480	Super Mario Galaxy two.
6030480	6034160	Of course the first game was really amazing and I think a lot of people kind of forget
6034160	6036120	that like it's a really great Wii game.
6036120	6038240	Super Mario Galaxy two is on the way.
6038240	6040980	And of course Super Mario Galaxy brought us B Mario.
6040980	6041980	How rad was that?
6041980	6042980	Right?
6042980	6043980	B Mario was actually really cool.
6043980	6047280	Um, right up there with like Tanooki suit Mario, maybe not as cool as Tanooki suit Mario,
6047280	6048280	but almost.
6048280	6053960	Well, Super Mario Galaxy two is trying to up the cute and, uh, the memorable Mario forms.
6053960	6058400	Cloud Mario is going to be one of the new Mario forms in Super Mario Galaxy two.
6058400	6062800	So you mean he's going to be angsty and have a big sword and ride a big motorcycle club
6062800	6063800	thing?
6063800	6064800	No, not that cloud.
6064800	6065800	Like a happy fluffy cloud.
6065800	6066800	Like a Bob Ross cloud.
6066800	6067800	Bob Ross, Bob Mario.
6067800	6068800	Yes.
6068800	6069800	He's a Bob Mario cloud.
6069800	6070800	Bob Mario.
6070800	6071800	There you go.
6071800	6075880	Uh, he got like these white overall looking things on instead and, uh, what he can do
6075880	6078940	with this power, he creates cloud steps.
6078940	6082160	He walks on them and can get to out of the way places.
6082160	6083160	By the way.
6083160	6085280	Um, there's also a rock form Mario in case you forgot.
6085280	6087320	So there are some new forms of Mario coming to the game.
6087320	6088320	That sounds kind of cool.
6088320	6089320	Actually.
6089320	6091760	I gotta say cloud Mario makes me kind of think of metal Mario from Mario 64.
6091760	6092760	Hmm.
6092760	6093760	I forgot about middle.
6093760	6095400	All right.
6095400	6097720	This one's a little interesting.
6097720	6101220	This story and we could probably have a much longer discussion about this, but I thought
6101220	6104820	the quote was worth talking about here and it's something I don't think everybody's really
6104820	6111560	thought about and that is how do you handle in a game like Def Jam rap star, the N word
6111560	6115960	and you know, cause a lot of rap music uses that word.
6115960	6118800	There's a lot of people that aren't comfortable saying that word.
6118800	6124140	So how do you kind of address this in the development of your video game?
6124140	6127880	And there's this very interesting article and I'll give credit to Destructoid who I'm,
6127880	6131720	I'm actually reading this from and stealing the article on that tries to kind of tackle
6131720	6133360	this topic here of this.
6133360	6137780	Now Konami, Def Jam, 4MM games, all the people that went into producing this game, they're
6137780	6141240	using radio edits for the songs and the music videos and so forth.
6141240	6145120	So I think that way you kind of skirt around the issue.
6145120	6150780	But actually the N word is, is, is one that kind of shows up still.
6150780	6154300	So they put in dashes for most foul words.
6154300	6157480	But they find that when people are playing it and this, this, this guy who wrote the
6157480	6161280	article for Destructoid is talking about, you know, when I was playing it, I, I was
6161280	6166400	okay with saying when I saw F dash dash, I would say, fuck S dash dash, I would say shit.
6166400	6171320	When I saw N dash dash, I didn't really want to say that word.
6171320	6176000	And so the guy at Destructoid went to Jamie King, who is the chief creative officer for
6176000	6179280	4MM games and got this quote in return.
6179280	6182600	And I thought this was worth sharing because you really have to think like, how do you,
6182600	6185380	how do you, you know, there are some people that play rock band and even the rock band
6185380	6186380	uses the radio edits.
6186380	6190040	Some people don't want to sing the fuck and the, you know, the, the, they're in some of
6190040	6191040	the songs, right?
6191040	6196160	It actually made it really hard for me to sing a, a fallout boys song, um, the scene
6196160	6198360	is seen it's an arms race, right?
6198360	6202120	Cause I'm, so you're just singing it in the car on the radio that I just automatically
6202120	6203120	enter.
6203120	6204960	I'm like, it's throwing me off.
6204960	6207380	It's scoring me down.
6207380	6209600	So anyway, here's a quote I wanted to share.
6209600	6213960	We don't have ownership of that word as white people of that word.
6213960	6218320	I think that word does come up and that is perhaps a word where with the radio edits,
6218320	6220220	there is an opportunity to not say it.
6220220	6223660	We certainly don't make it a central part of the story or the career mode.
6223660	6227720	That is a very personal decision in that point in time, regardless of race, creed, and color
6227720	6232440	as for how you use that word in the context of the song, obviously these artists are using
6232440	6233440	it.
6233440	6236780	They've empowered it and own it to just shy away and be frightened doesn't mean we should
6236780	6237880	abuse it.
6237880	6241840	And hopefully I think we've treated it in a respectful manner, the way all these artists
6241840	6248020	and their content in their work would expect us to very well thought out point on, on what
6248020	6250680	is a very tricky otherwise issue.
6250680	6252760	I just still like what Chris Rock said about it.
6252760	6253760	What?
6253760	6259040	So if you're, if you're a white person in your car listening to Dre, go ahead, say it,
6259040	6261840	go ahead and sing your Dre.
6261840	6267000	But no, um, well I told you about, and actually I found a comedian recently, I think it was
6267000	6271460	Brian Reagan, but back when I was hanging out with somebody else, we used to just go
6271460	6274360	around doing the white version.
6274360	6275360	Yeah.
6275360	6276360	Right, right.
6276360	6279680	And it was, we just did it because we thought the whole thing was, was kind of ridiculous
6279680	6280680	and funny.
6280680	6287800	So, well, I mean the, or the origin, but now being pulled into common usage, there's only
6287800	6293360	thing that's fine to take something and you know, take something that was, you know, made
6293360	6296900	for, well, okay, here's another example to rephrase better.
6296900	6299600	The triangle, the big gay triangle.
6299600	6300600	You know where that came from?
6300600	6301600	I do.
6301600	6305120	That came from, uh, the concentration camps in Germany.
6305120	6309260	The triangle was used to denote that they were in a concentration camp for being gay,
6309260	6312080	but now it's a symbol of pride, right?
6312080	6319460	So I say that if you can take something that was a sign of, you know, oppression or disrespect
6319460	6322840	and make it something that you can, you know, to bind everyone together, say, hey, this
6322840	6326600	is where we came from, this is us now, then I have no problem with it.
6326600	6332400	I actually would be bothered if it was taken out of the game used in that context.
6332400	6333400	You know what I mean?
6333400	6334400	Mm-hmm.
6334400	6335400	All right.
6335400	6336400	Well, that's all I had.
6336400	6338560	No, no, it's, it's, I thought the quote was worth sharing.
6338560	6343480	It's a touchy, tricky subject, but I thought it was a well thought out quote, especially,
6343480	6347400	you know, with game design, sometimes you have to approach these, it's just interesting
6347400	6352820	that a freaking video game, you have these sometimes very deep cultural questions that
6352820	6356760	you kind of realize like, oh, I'm going to have a lot of people paying attention to this
6356760	6357760	game.
6357760	6358760	How do we kind of approach this tricky topic?
6358760	6359760	Yeah.
6359760	6363000	You know, and that might go, and that's not just with words necessarily, but maybe images
6363000	6366200	and violence and, you know, sex and whatever else.
6366200	6367200	I say it comes down to this.
6367200	6369480	If you don't like it, don't play the game.
6369480	6370480	Fair enough.
6370480	6371480	All right.
6371480	6372480	Sorry, I didn't mean to make a long topic out of a short story.
6372480	6374760	No, no, but I, I, I'm glad that you brought that one up.
6374760	6375760	All right.
6375760	6376760	No problem.
6376760	6377760	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6377760	6378760	Oh, I got stuff.
6378760	6384560	Um, Rock Band, we, um, no, not only, um, but it's actually stuff that makes me very happy
6384560	6386060	because it's a bunch of stuff that I like.
6386060	6391200	There's, um, go heat in Cambria pack coming out with, with guns of summer, the, the, the
6391200	6399280	guns of summer, we, um, here we are juggernaut and the broken, um, the pack for, uh, 440
6399280	6400280	points.
6400280	6406560	Um, well, Microsoft points, um, or 200, we points each are 160 Microsoft points each.
6406560	6413020	And then, um, individual traffic, traffic tracks guy, I can't tell today are all songs
6413020	6414020	that I like.
6414020	6418600	There's Susie and the Banshees, peekaboo fuck yes.
6418600	6420320	We needed more Susie and the Banshees on a rock band.
6420320	6424440	There's a three pack out there, but peekaboo was like their biggest mainstream song.
6424440	6425440	I think.
6425440	6428080	So I'm kind of surprised that wasn't in the first group, um, super grass, sun hits the
6428080	6429080	sky.
6429080	6430080	I love super grass.
6430080	6433660	Um, and the violent femmes, American music and the ones that are going to be on Lego
6433660	6439440	rock band, our guns of summer, the broken and a sun hits the sky, the super grass song.
6439440	6441200	Also more stuff.
6441200	6446840	Um, Lord of Ultima, um, is, uh, the, the browser version MMO.
6446840	6447840	Oh, sure.
6447840	6450360	Let me get away from the glue.
6450360	6451360	Sure.
6451360	6452360	Sure.
6452360	6453360	She's like, what's this glue?
6453360	6454360	Sniff, sniff, sniff.
6454360	6455360	Uh, don't like it.
6455360	6458840	Um, but there is a beta, um, on for this, so you could play it, but it's coming out
6458840	6459840	a week.
6459840	6460840	So whatever.
6460840	6465640	Um, but it's, uh, Lord's of Ultima coming out April 20th, Tuesday.
6465640	6467040	Oh, that's not a week.
6467040	6469040	That's a couple of days.
6469040	6470040	Anyway.
6470040	6474960	Also iPhone games, uh, Street Fighter four gets a new challenger.
6474960	6480760	You get Kami for free Kami in her butt.
6480760	6482920	That's it for free.
6482920	6484840	Is that, are they doing like a version upgrade or something?
6484840	6486760	I guess it must be interesting.
6486760	6492880	All right, well let's go to the Twitter and uh, every week we take your Twitter topics.
6492880	6498220	You can follow us on Twitter at O L R and send us messages and uh, we post little reminders
6498220	6502240	about when the show is posted and when we're going to go live and uh, sometimes especially
6502240	6506160	the real big time to be following O L R on Twitter is when we're at shows because we
6506160	6511760	will like post pictures and take questions and I remember last E3 I was just like, okay
6511760	6514380	Twitter people, what do you want to, what do you want to see today?
6514380	6518280	And I uh, let people basically, I was everybody's bitch on the internet.
6518280	6519280	It was fun.
6519280	6520280	Good times.
6520280	6523960	Anyway, let's go to the Twitter questions and uh, see what you guys have for us tonight.
6523960	6525840	Not a whole lot, but some good stuff.
6525840	6533800	The shadow sniper on Twitter says, what's a good 32 inch HDTV for gaming max $550.
6533800	6538340	So he's setting kind of a lowish limit, but I'm assuming maybe shadow sniper has saved
6538340	6542440	enough money that maybe they want to go purchase a TV.
6542440	6544280	I'm making a guess.
6544280	6548980	I have a 52 inch, um, I think mine's a Samsung.
6548980	6552160	So and we got ours for about 1200 so do the math.
6552160	6558440	You can find, you know, a good, you know, 20 something, 30 something inch for around
6558440	6559440	there.
6559440	6560440	Right.
6560440	6561440	Samsung makes good stuff.
6561440	6565440	I also, I wouldn't, well, I would say, I can't tell you like a brand name and whatever right
6565440	6568280	off the top of my head, but let me give you a few things to look for because you're shopping
6568280	6571440	on the cheap end of things, a couple of things to look out for.
6571440	6576880	There's a lot of HD TVs that are sold, but they're only 720 P and that's fine.
6576880	6581600	It's a good quality picture, but just keep in mind it's not 10 80 P or it's not even
6581600	6586920	10 80 I, my TV, however, is 10 80 I only and it works just fine.
6586920	6590160	Like I don't, like there's been some times where I'm like, Oh, I should get a 10 EP,
6590160	6591420	but then I'm like, why?
6591420	6593440	It's not really going to be that big a difference.
6593440	6594760	You know, there's no difference.
6594760	6598480	So I've had, I have both, but do you think there's a difference between seven 20 and
6598480	6599480	10 80?
6599480	6602200	See, I would say that you could probably tell a little bit, it looks a little blurry or
6602200	6608080	it's not quite as, you know, um, Chris, but 10 80 I and 10 AP, if seriously, if you're
6608080	6610280	flipping between the two, you'd never be able to tell the difference.
6610280	6615760	Uh, I think ours is a 10 80 P, but you know, again, SSJ 100 Matt says, all I can say is
6615760	6617560	don't get a Phillips and get a warranty.
6617560	6619840	Ziba in our chat says, Vizio is cheap and okay.
6619840	6624920	I have a Vizio and I got it from a Costco, which I think is a great place to buy TVs.
6624920	6627080	You know, they've revoked the, the constant return.
6627080	6630720	I heard, well, people were probably abusing the hell out of it.
6630720	6632440	I was like, what took them so long?
6632440	6633880	I'm glad that we got our TV.
6633880	6636880	They still have some, they still have some type of return policy, don't they?
6636880	6641440	Yeah, but it's not the free returns for life, a free upgrades for life pretty much.
6641440	6642440	Yeah.
6642440	6643440	So that's good.
6643440	6644440	I'm glad they got rid of that.
6644440	6645440	They needed to.
6645440	6646440	All right.
6646440	6647440	Uh, oops.
6647440	6650320	I was looking to let you put it this way.
6650320	6654560	Um, Oh, wait, shadow sniper sent us that tweet twice and I got thrown off.
6654560	6655560	Sorry.
6655560	6656560	Oh yeah.
6656560	6660120	Look, you know, I was going to say, um, refurbished stuff also is not bad.
6660120	6665440	We had a, our first HDTV was a refurbished, uh, I don't remember what brand it was now,
6665440	6667320	but I think make sure it's factory refurb, right?
6667320	6668320	Yeah.
6668320	6671040	It was factory referred, but the only really difference between that and the current model
6671040	6676640	is it didn't have an HDMI port, which I could care less cause I don't really use it.
6676640	6680920	Um, I do now I use it on my PlayStation three because I just don't want to have to swap
6680920	6685160	HD, uh, components stuff, but I mean, you could, if you really want to, you could get
6685160	6688440	like a converter for that, but it's not a big deal.
6688440	6694000	But um, you know, we got ours, I think is for $800 a while back, but you know, I've
6694000	6701520	now have a Sony, a 40 inch, um, uh, Bravia, I think it's not bad.
6701520	6702520	Shadow sniper.
6702520	6703520	I hope you're in chat.
6703520	6706140	I don't see your name unless you're on something else in chat, but there's like all the chatters
6706140	6707440	are jumping in here.
6707440	6711440	Uh, cheeseburger says I got a 24 inch as Seuss from new egg.
6711440	6713240	It's 10 ADP and I love it for gaming.
6713240	6714240	Dude.
6714240	6715240	You're 16.
6715240	6716240	How did you get that?
6716240	6717240	He must have a job already.
6717240	6718240	I don't know.
6718240	6719240	Or, or got some money from the parents.
6719240	6720240	I don't know.
6720240	6721800	Uh, act F says 32 inch.
6721800	6723060	You're not going to notice a difference.
6723060	6725400	And Weiland says I have a 10 ADP, 42 inch sharp.
6725400	6726400	I got it for $500.
6726400	6727400	Whew.
6727400	6730120	Maybe I need to get in the market for a new TV now.
6730120	6731120	Here you go.
6731120	6732120	I've had mine for a while.
6732120	6741240	Um, they have a viewsonic 32 inch 1080p LCD HDTV on new egg for $499.99, $40 for shipping.
6741240	6744680	And Sharon says I'm still running the same SDTV I have for five years.
6744680	6745680	It does what it needs to.
6745680	6750800	Or actually they also have another Toshiba that's our Toshiba one that's actually also
6750800	6753200	10 ADP, $5 shipping though on that one.
6753200	6759560	So I'd say that's probably the, uh, the best, uh, or cheapest one you're gonna find.
6759560	6764320	Actually let me, let me get into some of the, Loki's just shopping on newegg.com.
6764320	6765320	Check it out.
6765320	6769480	Uh, the other thing too is actually watch, um, sellout.woot.com.
6769480	6770480	Oh yeah.
6770480	6771480	And Woot.
6771480	6772480	Oh yeah.
6772480	6773480	Woot will have some good TVs.
6773480	6774480	It's $5 shipping.
6774480	6775480	Exactly.
6775480	6776480	$5 shipping.
6776480	6777480	That's where I need to buy a new TV is woot.com honestly.
6777480	6778480	Keep an eye out.
6778480	6779480	Okay.
6779480	6780480	We've got to get some other tweets.
6780480	6781480	One last little one.
6781480	6782480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6782480	6783480	Best Buy.
6783480	6784480	Uh huh.
6784480	6785480	Look in their returns.
6785480	6787240	A lot of times stuff's brought back because it's just dinged on the side or something.
6787240	6790800	If you don't care about what it looks like on the outside of it, you can get a good deal.
6790800	6795840	We got our refrigerator for like 300 bucks off and our dryer for like two thirds the
6795840	6796840	cost.
6796840	6797840	Oh wow.
6797840	6798840	Because they were just dinged.
6798840	6799840	Awesome.
6799840	6800840	So.
6800840	6805640	Uh, Surtur on our Twitter says, playing Harvest Moon Friends of Mineral Town on my GBA, waiting
6805640	6808320	for Harvest Moon Hero of Leaf Valley to come out on the PSP.
6808320	6810680	I guess that's a little bit of his gaming week right there.
6810680	6811960	Harvest Moon.
6811960	6814120	I'm surprised that's a series I didn't get more into.
6814120	6815120	I don't know.
6815120	6817240	Uh, Tiger Claw says there's some links on Twitter.
6817240	6820760	Uh, this one was originally in the show roll and I bumped it for something else that I
6820760	6821760	wanted to talk about more.
6821760	6823280	Uh, it was about No Doubt.
6823280	6828760	And uh, apparently No Doubt, uh, they have won the first few um, skirmishes in the battle
6828760	6829760	with Activision.
6829760	6834080	Uh, I guess Activision wanted the thing thrown out of court because it was a lawsuit without
6834080	6835080	merit.
6835080	6836080	But guess what?
6836080	6837080	The Los Angeles County Superior Court.
6837080	6838960	They ruled in favor of No Doubt.
6838960	6844440	So they rejected the shift to a federal court and rejected Activision's, uh, efforts to
6844440	6847840	try and put free speech in, uh, free speech injunctions involved.
6847840	6849720	I, I'm kind of not surprised by that move.
6849720	6852520	I think, uh, No Doubt could have a very good argument here.
6852520	6854660	It's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out.
6854660	6856720	I'd really love to see the contract they signed.
6856720	6861400	I mean, without being able to read that, I, I, it's hard for me to take sides in this.
6861400	6865720	So it's very interesting to see what's going to happen in court of law.
6865720	6868840	Also I think worthy of mention, Tiger Claw sends this on Twitter.
6868840	6871440	Starcraft 2, this is a very recent news.
6871440	6875000	Starcraft 2 has been given an adults only rating in South Korea.
6875000	6879960	That, you know, if a game gets an adults rating over here, only rating over here, it can be
6879960	6880960	kind of damning.
6880960	6884840	Uh, they, Blizzard was shooting for an over 12 rating in the country.
6884840	6887720	Originally they had been assigned an over 15.
6887720	6892040	They sent a newer build of the game or something and now they got adults only.
6892040	6893520	No word on why.
6893520	6897280	Uh, joke all you want about the addiction level of the game, seeing as this is South
6897280	6899880	Korea, but I don't think that plays a part in it.
6899880	6904640	So, um, it might, it could, I don't know, but Blizzard's going to appeal it of course,
6904640	6905640	and they'll probably get their way.
6905640	6910480	I mean, it's that the release of that game is going to be like a cultural event over
6910480	6911480	there.
6911480	6916480	I mean, it's, it's, it's on the scale of a, I don't know, what are the huge releases here?
6916480	6922600	Modern Warfare, Halo, Final Fantasy type release, obviously, um, Spassinator says, uh, I guess
6922600	6925840	for tonight's show, the show has been renamed orange bra radio, huh?
6925840	6927080	Maybe that's what we need to sell.
6927080	6928080	Dark soccer.
6928080	6929080	We should look into that.
6929080	6933920	Bras that are orange for the lady fans of the show with OLR right on the cups.
6933920	6934920	All right.
6934920	6935920	All right.
6935920	6939120	Uh, red entertainment says, uh, is there a reason why Activision hasn't created their
6939120	6940760	own bank in real life?
6940760	6941760	Sure.
6941760	6946400	It might be illegal, but that hasn't stopped companies before, uh, creating their own bank.
6946400	6950480	Do you mean like buying all their stock and there's, there's antigen.
6950480	6951480	I don't know.
6951480	6956080	I think he's being silly, but I don't know if I really get the joke, uh, sponge twang
6956080	6961200	says to us on Twitter, let DS master 26 know I would take him up on his DDR perfect attack
6961200	6962200	challenge.
6962200	6963200	LOL.
6963200	6964960	I only have access to songs on supernova too.
6964960	6969600	Well, you guys, you might want to try to find each other on Twitter and, uh, just YouTube
6969600	6970600	the battle.
6970600	6971600	That's all we need.
6971600	6976080	Uh, did your Rama S is sending us a message saying, I don't remember you guys saying that
6976080	6978880	the slim X-Box three 60 was a fake.
6978880	6982720	I don't remember saying it either cause I thought it was actually a definitely a plausible
6982720	6983720	idea.
6983720	6984720	I don't think it's fake.
6984720	6985720	I don't think it's fake either.
6985720	6987360	Was it proven fake this week or something?
6987360	6988360	I didn't see it.
6988360	6989360	It was.
6989360	6990360	I missed it.
6990360	6991360	No, I don't think I haven't seen anything.
6991360	6992360	I it's real.
6992360	6994760	I mean, seriously, if something did happen, it'll be in chat soon.
6994760	6995760	We'll see.
6995760	6996760	All right.
6996760	6998480	Anyhow, let's get into some other gaming news.
6998480	6999480	Uh, Loki.
6999480	7000480	Yeah.
7000480	7004720	I was going to say it's, it's definitely happy.
7004720	7009240	Um, one thing that is not happening though would be PlayStation room.
7009240	7010240	What is room?
7010240	7013160	You may ask because you might've forgotten since they haven't really mentioned anything
7013160	7014920	other than what it was teased.
7014920	7015920	I think.
7015920	7016920	I don't remember if it was Tokyo game show.
7016920	7019960	I think it was Tokyo game shows where they showed it off anyways.
7019960	7025240	Uh, PlayStation room was sort of like home is like a social networking service that was
7025240	7029320	going to be available for the PSP where he had little characters or avatars that kind
7029320	7038040	of look like almost like, uh, me's or your avatars that you have on, um, on Xbox live.
7038040	7045800	But um, apparently it, uh, finished the Japanese only closed beta and they decided that they're
7045800	7049360	going to cease development on the service.
7049360	7054440	So Oh, well, I guess that's not coming.
7054440	7057720	They just pulled the plug because there just wasn't gonna be enough interest in it or too
7057720	7060800	many resources or home didn't take off the way they wanted it to or why?
7060800	7065160	Because they're going to save it for the next nail PlayStation portable platform.
7065160	7066160	That's a darn good thought.
7066160	7067160	I bet that's really it.
7067160	7069560	Uh, by the way, Rama wanted to clarify his tweet.
7069560	7075760	He sent us a link to a news article on xbox.com talking about the recent Xbox 360 slim images
7075760	7081040	are fake and it shows a picture of a reported Xbox 360 slim and it's just an HD DVD player
7081040	7082440	tilted the wrong way.
7082440	7083440	Okay.
7083440	7084440	That's fair enough.
7084440	7085440	Yeah.
7085440	7086760	That picture is obviously fake, but that's not the same picture that came up on the show
7086760	7093600	a couple of weeks ago, so it might be disputing this story is a fake, but I think pictures
7093600	7094600	are not.
7094600	7099380	I still think the concept of the xbox 360 slim and just some of the things that were
7099380	7102800	being talked about at that time, I think are certainly still plausible, although certainly
7102800	7105860	there are going to be many websites out there that claim to have it even though they don't
7105860	7109560	cause they're lying liars.
7109560	7110560	I wouldn't lie to you guys.
7110560	7116020	I have to make a comment from a Weiland because I posted a picture, um, one of the people
7116020	7122840	I follow on deviantart, um, did, uh, a picture of Deadpool singing his own theme song, the
7122840	7127200	Spiderman theme song, and he said that Deadpool needs to be a Marvel versus Capcom three.
7127200	7128560	I agree.
7128560	7132840	And they need to get the people who did his stuff on Mugen to, to make him.
7132840	7134320	All right.
7134320	7135800	So I have to agree to that.
7135800	7136800	All right.
7136800	7141120	Well, uh, let's talk about more PlayStation news and this is actually really important.
7141120	7145960	Uh, PlayStation news, they usually do the network updates on Thursdays.
7145960	7148560	That is actually going to be changing.
7148560	7153000	And the theory is that this is actually part of the response to, um, actually why the Xbox
7153000	7154160	does their releases.
7154160	7156700	Uh, here's the deal.
7156700	7161120	The American and European PlayStation store updates, they are moving starting in May to
7161120	7167240	new days and PlayStation network in North America will now be Tuesdays.
7167240	7169480	In Europe it will be now on Wednesday.
7169480	7171560	Uh, kind of interesting.
7171560	7177240	Uh, I think there are people out there that might buy games on Microsoft just because
7177240	7180100	they can get them two days before they do on PS3.
7180100	7181100	Do you think that that's true?
7181100	7183680	Loki, that there's people out there that buy games on 360 simply because you can get it
7183680	7185080	like a two days before?
7185080	7186080	No.
7186080	7187080	Really?
7187080	7188080	I doubt it.
7188080	7189080	Really?
7189080	7190480	It's just basically forum bragging rights.
7190480	7191480	That's about it.
7191480	7192480	Huh?
7192480	7193480	We eat the game earlier than you do.
7193480	7194480	That's basically it.
7194480	7197580	I think there is a small, it's small, but I think there's a group of people out there
7197580	7203320	that knowing they can get the game, the game, the game a day sooner on the PS3 will opt
7203320	7204320	to get it on the PS3.
7204320	7205320	Yeah.
7205320	7209720	And well, I guess they would be able to say, Hey, you know, you can get the game here first.
7209720	7212680	You know, they can use that tagline or whatever.
7212680	7213680	Hmm.
7213680	7215520	Well, there you go.
7215520	7219040	The updates are moving to be a little more competitive with Microsoft, although they
7219040	7222480	didn't say that of course in the update, but I'm sure they were like, Oh, we're doing it
7222480	7225160	because we want to be earlier.
7225160	7226640	I didn't watch the video of the release.
7226640	7229940	All you need to know is that it's moving two days back and, and now it's going to get very
7229940	7234360	interesting to see if that changes sales figures or not.
7234360	7235360	We'll see.
7235360	7236360	Hey Rob.
7236360	7237360	What's that?
7237360	7239080	Um, who was it that just posted that?
7239080	7240080	Um, Ziba?
7240080	7241080	Yes.
7241080	7248520	Put a deals.woot link in for a 42 inch, 10 ADP LCD HDTV with three HDMI inputs refurbished
7248520	7249520	for $549.99.
7249520	7250520	Really?
7250520	7251520	Yep.
7251520	7252520	Hold on.
7252520	7253520	I'm looking at this right now.
7253520	7254520	Is it still like $5 shipping?
7254520	7255520	It's Phillips.
7255520	7256520	We were warned.
7256520	7257520	We were warned about Phillips.
7257520	7258520	I don't know.
7258520	7262360	And I'm going to tell everybody, whenever you're going through any of these sites and
7262360	7266480	everything, no, no, there were a few people who actually said they recommended that it
7266480	7267480	was great.
7267480	7271480	Um, but always, always check consumer reports before you buy anything.
7271480	7272480	Good idea.
7272480	7274280	Especially before you spend that kind of money.
7274280	7275280	Yeah.
7275280	7276280	Free shipping even.
7276280	7277280	Interesting.
7277280	7278280	It's tempting.
7278280	7281960	There's people on here who said they did a good job with it.
7281960	7282960	Interesting.
7282960	7283960	I don't have to think about it.
7283960	7287000	It's very anti Phillips though, I'll have to hear more about his story before I had
7287000	7288000	decided to do it.
7288000	7289000	But thank you Zeba.
7289000	7290000	I appreciate you looking out.
7290000	7291000	Kiss, kiss.
7291000	7297120	And there's a $10 coupon off for, um, at buy.com.
7297120	7298120	We'll see.
7298120	7300160	I don't, I really, honestly, guys, I shouldn't be spending money on a TV.
7300160	7301160	You know what I really need to buy?
7301160	7302160	A new car.
7302160	7304960	And let's not even start that debate because everybody's going to try to sell me a different
7304960	7305960	car.
7305960	7306960	I am pretty sure I know what car I'm getting.
7306960	7312840	Um, I just have to, uh, go get it, which hopefully will be soon.
7312840	7313840	Anyhow, let's move on.
7313840	7314840	Sakura.
7314840	7315840	Other stuff.
7315840	7316840	Dun, dun, dun.
7316840	7320800	Um, this is actually really sad news.
7320800	7329560	Um, Sega has made a business decision and they are closing half of their GameWorks arcades
7329560	7339920	that, um, they, uh, are, you can't, no more good beer, no more good, God, they had good
7339920	7340920	food.
7340920	7347360	Um, they're not saying which exactly ones are going to be closing, but, um, they're
7347360	7353160	going to be, uh, closing, uh, seven, actually, well, less than half, but just under half,
7353160	7355280	seven of the 15 locations.
7355280	7359840	Some of them being Minneapolis, Long Beach, Columbus, Detroit, Indianapolis, Miami, and
7359840	7360840	Tampa.
7360840	7361840	But Seattle will live.
7361840	7362840	In theory.
7362840	7367040	Well, this, I'm sorry, but this news story calls for a little bit of sad trombone.
7367040	7370960	There you go.
7370960	7373760	Yeah, that's, that puts sadness into my heart.
7373760	7375520	Well, it is sad.
7375520	7376840	Arcades closing is sad.
7376840	7377840	Whatever.
7377840	7382140	I mean, I honestly feel like just when the past, like the lifespan of our show, we have
7382140	7385240	literally watched arcades die.
7385240	7386240	You know what I mean?
7386240	7387240	It's, it is sad.
7387240	7388240	It is sad trombone.
7388240	7389600	It's worse than sad trombone.
7389600	7390600	It's sad elephone.
7390600	7392600	It's sad tuba.
7392600	7393600	Yes.
7393600	7396960	It's just, I don't know, it's just unfortunate.
7396960	7398280	Because you know, we all met at the arcade.
7398280	7402640	I don't know if the show would happen if we had all met on Xbox live or something different.
7402640	7406400	You know, it's just, it's just sad that arcades are closing down.
7406400	7407400	I mean, it's not a surprise.
7407400	7410000	I hate that the arcades that we've met at is still open.
7410000	7412800	It is, but it's, but it's different now.
7412800	7414200	You know, you go over there, it's just not the same.
7414200	7416520	I haven't been there in years.
7416520	7418120	It's weird.
7418120	7422100	So all right, well, sorry to hear about the GameWorks closing.
7422100	7425320	More sorry to hear about the people who lose their jobs because of it.
7425320	7426320	That's the other big rumor.
7426320	7427320	Sad banana phone.
7427320	7428320	That's right.
7428320	7429320	Sad banana phone.
7429320	7430320	All right.
7430320	7431320	Low key.
7431320	7432320	That would be what, the banana phone song in a minor key?
7432320	7433320	Maybe.
7433320	7436120	I've never heard, actually, is there a sad banana phone?
7436120	7438320	Like you two, I don't have to hear this.
7438320	7440640	No, Rob.
7440640	7447760	So apparently the MPD numbers for March are out, and people are declaring Red Steel 2
7447760	7449680	a flop.
7449680	7455200	Apparently the game only sold 50,000 copies in its opening month.
7455200	7457520	Okay, let's stop it right there.
7457520	7463160	Yeah, they sold 50,000 copies in the first, what, 12 days that it was out?
7463160	7465160	14 days?
7465160	7471520	So I wouldn't exactly call it a flop, but it is kind of on par with the other, the other
7471520	7477760	Wii mature games, I guess, are out there, even though it is teen rated, but still.
7477760	7481080	I can confirm, though, it had, it did sell about 50,000 copies.
7481080	7488240	It was like 49,000 and change, but I don't think it's actually going to be a flop, per
7488240	7495160	se, because I know copies are still being sold, and also, you know, it might be something
7495160	7498120	people are picking up a little bit later on.
7498120	7502880	I know the first Red Steel apparently sold over 100,000 copies in its first week, although
7502880	7506960	that you can attribute to the fact that the Wii just launched, and so everybody's picking
7506960	7511080	up games for it, and Red Steel 1, you know, had the promise of being, you know, kind of
7511080	7519920	what Red Steel 2 is, so I wouldn't say that's really a good comparison either, but definitely
7519920	7525480	it has been the trend that hardcore games, like Red Steel, haven't done well on the Wii,
7525480	7531180	so we'll see if maybe this will break the mold.
7531180	7534840	I guess it is probably too early to declare it a flop, but do you think there will be
7534840	7537400	a Red Steel 3, or is it just too early to tell, period?
7537400	7540520	Oh yeah, I'm sure there will be, and you know, here's the thing, it's like, the same thing
7540520	7545400	happened with DJ Hero, where they're like, oh, it didn't sell, you know, for shit, and
7545400	7551440	they really only had like, what, a week worth of data to go off of, so you have to just
7551440	7556260	look at the amount of time that's, you know, passed, and where it's coming out in the month.
7556260	7560600	If it came out, say, in the first week in March, then it would be a different story.
7560600	7565080	Then yes, it would be almost a month, well, it would be over a month that had passed,
7565080	7569320	but those numbers would be reflecting at least most of the month, and yeah, that would be
7569320	7575640	a flop, but seeing that it came out kind of at the end of the month, I wouldn't really
7575640	7583760	call it a flop yet, but once the April NPD numbers come out, then you can call it a flop.
7583760	7586080	Alright, I don't think this is a flop.
7586080	7589600	This sounds like it's going to be the truth, at least this website is placing all their
7589600	7590760	stock into it.
7590760	7595760	Planetxbox360.com is running a report saying that their tipster, who's been right 19 out
7595760	7602460	of 20 times, I like to know the one they were wrong on, but the tipster is saying that Capcom
7602460	7607880	had its captivate press event over in Hawaii this past weekend, and apparently what was
7607880	7612440	being shown at the event, well, final builds of Lost Planet 2 and Dead Rising 2, which
7612440	7616640	is to be expected, but there were also some surprise announcements that happened at this
7616640	7621420	event that you just haven't heard about yet, for whatever reasons, probably because the
7621420	7624320	journalists are still coming back, or they are-
7624320	7625320	Embargoes.
7625320	7628440	Yeah, embargoes for a certain day, absolutely, that's probably what's going on, because you
7628440	7629720	know why they do embargoes?
7629720	7632000	Well, I'll get into that rant in a minute.
7632000	7633000	Yeah.
7633000	7634000	First off-
7634000	7635000	I know why they do embargoes.
7635000	7636000	Yeah, there's two reasons they do embargoes.
7636000	7639720	We'll get into that in a minute, but first, the leaks that they're talking about, Marvel
7639720	7645760	vs. Capcom 3 is supposedly going to be one of the games that comes out of this, running
7645760	7649880	at a full 720p, actually, they have a little teaser art, I don't see Deadpool, but I can
7649880	7650880	see-
7650880	7651880	No, that's not-
7651880	7657680	Oh, duh, they wouldn't have the art, they would have to, yeah, of course, duh duh.
7657680	7661960	But anyway, it's gonna be a disc-based game, it is not Xbox Live Arcade, it is not PSN,
7661960	7668480	it is full 720p for the games, which is typical for video games, apparently they spotted a
7668480	7673600	Marvel employee at the event, the Twitter account for Marvel vs. Capcom popped back
7673600	7679720	up recently, yeah, I mean, it all kinda seems like this is going on, they are just saying
7679720	7684540	they're gonna blow fans out of the water with the sheer number of characters the game includes
7684540	7685720	on the disc.
7685720	7693440	It will be a 2D game, but think Street Fighter IV, like, Street Fighter IV had its 3D elements.
7693440	7703240	As far as that goes, I can't see how that is not true, because, I mean, Capcom has been
7703240	7709440	awesome at sucking the fanboy wank for the past couple years now, I mean, think about
7709440	7710440	it.
7710440	7713960	Think about the projects that Capcom's done, oh, we should do a Street Fighter IV that's
7713960	7717700	a little more inspired by Street Fighter II and it's like 2D, but, okay, is that what
7717700	7718700	you want, guys?
7718700	7719700	You got it.
7719700	7723160	Oh, you want a new Mega Man game that's just like Mega Man 2 and the old school games you
7723160	7724160	love on the NES?
7724160	7725840	Okay, guys, you got it.
7725840	7726840	What?
7726840	7731560	You want us to remake Bionic Commando and make it all souped up for Xbox Live- oh, okay,
7731560	7733400	you crazy kids, you got it.
7733400	7737520	Like, really, I mean, hasn't Capcom almost more so than any other company as of late
7737520	7741080	been like, fanboy wank, you want it, you got it?
7741080	7744400	Well, because they know if there's a cry for it, people are gonna spend money on it.
7744400	7747200	Exactly, and what is the next thing people have been crying for?
7747200	7748480	Marvel versus Capcom.
7748480	7752560	And the only reason people say it's not happening is because of agreements and deals and Marvel
7752560	7757280	and da-da-da, but when Marvel's got all these movies they wanna do, right?
7757280	7758280	What better time?
7758280	7759840	Especially with Iron Man 2 coming out soon.
7759840	7762200	You know who I want in it?
7762200	7764920	Howard the Duck.
7764920	7765920	Maybe it's an unlockable character.
7765920	7769200	Howard the Duck's a Marvel character, and he knows quack-fu.
7769200	7773960	Dark Tetsuya says, uh, so more than the 56 that were in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, holy fuck.
7773960	7776560	I guess so, if this is to be believed.
7776560	7777560	I don't know.
7777560	7783680	I mean, I, again, it seems very logical, and why not.
7783680	7788200	Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 also being shown at the press event, apparently.
7788200	7790280	There I guess is not much about this.
7790280	7793520	There was just a trailer that was shown, but apparently they're saying there will be more
7793520	7798880	at E3 2010, but the big, big announcement was Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
7798880	7800740	So there you go.
7800740	7802400	I guess you'll hear more about it this week.
7802400	7805600	Now, do we wanna go onto the topic of Embargos and why you're not hearing about this right
7805600	7806600	now?
7806600	7807600	Please do.
7807600	7811820	Keep in mind, these journalists went to Hawaii.
7811820	7814440	They didn't pay to go to Hawaii.
7814440	7818400	Capcom paid for them to come out and go to Hawaii just to go to this event, and it probably
7818400	7822280	wasn't just the event, but there was probably some, like, hoo-ha fancy dinners and luaus
7822280	7828440	and all these other things that come with it, and, I mean, I don't know, there's a part
7828440	7831320	of me that's kinda like, wow, that's almost, I don't know.
7831320	7834400	You almost have to, you're gonna have to take reviews of these games with a grain of salt.
7834400	7838960	Well, there's something also here, I'd just like to point this out, because this was on
7838960	7839960	JoySig.
7839960	7842560	It was a little kind of note at the bottom.
7842560	7845840	It says, editor's note, JoySig is not attending Captivate this year.
7845840	7850280	We determined that the perceived environment and the associated downtime of the event was
7850280	7853400	not in accordance with our editorial policy.
7853400	7857480	We expected to provide complete coverage of all the Capcom titles shown at Captivate during
7857480	7863920	E3 this June, and then for more information on our policies, they have a link, and basically,
7863920	7868880	I actually read through their policies where they don't keep any of the promotional stuff
7868880	7874480	that they give them the kind of, you know, wet the whistle, I guess, you know, just to
7874480	7875480	make...
7875480	7876480	And they won't take trips and so forth.
7876480	7877800	They won't take trips or anything, so...
7877800	7878960	I can respect that.
7878960	7883800	I actually, I can respect that policy quite a bit, you know, and it's interesting because
7883800	7887520	they ran the same story, right, about the leaks, and now they're not, and they're not
7887520	7890680	held to any type of embargo because they didn't go to the event.
7890680	7895480	But it's very interesting because, I don't know how much we should say about this, but
7895480	7900400	the three of us, I believe all three of us, once went to a press event for a company,
7900400	7904360	and we won't say who, but we went to this press event and it was embargoed, meaning
7904360	7908920	we couldn't talk about it until, I believe, two days after the event.
7908920	7909920	Yeah.
7909920	7911800	Yeah, I want to say it was two days after.
7911800	7914760	And we were like, okay, fine, that gives us the time to kind of prep what we want to do
7914760	7917960	on it, and we want to do extensive coverage on some of these things that we saw at the
7917960	7918960	event.
7918960	7928080	And the next day, big websites like oneup.com, I want to say GamePro, IGN, they all were
7928080	7933400	suddenly running stories on certain games shown at this event, but each website was
7933400	7938880	showing one different game.
7938880	7945000	And we were kind of sitting here going, well, why did we do those embargoes then?
7945000	7949480	And it just, you know, kind of the realization was that, oh, these guys probably had sold
7949480	7955480	exclusive deals with these companies to get the first coverage on the game, because you
7955480	7960400	know that if IGN is the first one that's going to run a news story on let's make something
7960400	7965160	up, Capcom, Resident Evil, let's say Resident Evil 6 is announced, IGN has an exclusive
7965160	7967040	deal to announce Resident Evil 6.
7967040	7970780	The deal is they'll say what the company wants them to say, and they'll get hits from it.
7970780	7973960	It's kind of shady, this stuff that goes on.
7973960	7979440	Or they'll allow them to say later on, get a good deal on placing those giant splash
7979440	7983840	ads that cover the entire background of their front page or something like that.
7983840	7988200	Yeah, it's shady, but that's how the big boys do it.
7988200	7994400	Yeah, well that's why I'm perfectly fine with our show being off the radar, even if we suffer
7994400	7999960	in the number of listeners because of it, although if a game company wanted to fly me
7999960	8003000	to Hawaii to check out their game schedule, I'm not going to say no.
8003000	8006860	I don't think we have that same editorial policy, but I think the general understanding
8006860	8010400	is that we're going to be honest at the end of the day, period.
8010400	8014960	But I can see where people might be like, oh, but you getting all this lavish treatment,
8014960	8017320	you're going to have a biased opinion on the game.
8017320	8019320	And that's why Joystiq has the policy they do.
8019320	8020600	Not really, I can't imagine.
8020600	8021600	I don't either.
8021600	8026240	I've gone to events and seen games and said, you know what, they need to work on it.
8026240	8029920	We've gone to Konami events, and there's a lot of stuff that we've been pretty negative
8029920	8030920	about.
8030920	8039040	That's why we're not invited to Konami events anymore, probably.
8039040	8040480	You know what?
8040480	8045680	Until you stop going to IGN4U News and until you stop going to the very first website that
8045680	8049740	cracks all this information, this trend will continue, period.
8049740	8050740	So I'll bet you what?
8050740	8055480	I bet you some website beats the others to the punch on this news, assuming it turns
8055480	8059160	out to be true, which again, I'm sure it is.
8059160	8062420	This would make perfect sense for Capcom, period.
8062420	8064480	This is more of a will Marvel let them do it question and answer.
8064480	8067920	This is rumored to be revealed in a few weeks anyway, so.
8067920	8068920	That's true.
8068920	8070400	It was already going around.
8070400	8074400	Oh, now some people are bringing up the whole Adartetsuya saying, I'm sure they were buying
8074400	8075400	the 10s.
8075400	8076500	They were going to give in their review.
8076500	8080040	That kind of references the whole, um, oh God, what was it?
8080040	8081040	It was a game.
8081040	8082040	Kane and Lynch.
8082040	8083040	Yes.
8083040	8084040	Kane and Lynch and GameSpot.
8084040	8086880	And the guy ended up leaving over it and Gerstmann.
8086880	8087880	Oh man.
8087880	8088880	Oh man.
8088880	8089880	What a mess.
8089880	8090880	Act.
8090880	8093240	F wanted to reiterate that Kotaku has a similar policy.
8093240	8094480	I just, I missed it.
8094480	8095480	Okay.
8095480	8098400	I've been gone all weekend, but I'm sure there's lots of websites that have very similar policy.
8098400	8103240	So then my question would be who went, I don't know, not everybody can be trusted.
8103240	8104240	Somebody blabbed their mouth.
8104240	8105240	The planet.
8105240	8109200	I didn't see anybody saying, Hey, we're going to captivate and we'll be talking about it
8109200	8110200	because it's embargo.
8110200	8111680	They can't say they're going well.
8111680	8112680	Big Capcom news.
8112680	8120040	As soon as I get home from Hawaii, anyhow.
8120040	8121040	All right, let's move on.
8121040	8123680	Uh, we're going to get to the mailbag every week.
8123680	8127360	You guys send us emails, mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and we would like to crack
8127360	8132120	open the mailbag and read them here on the air.
8132120	8135160	Mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark Sakura dive in the mailbag head first.
8135160	8136160	Pull out some emails.
8136160	8137160	You know what, Rob though?
8137160	8138160	I have to say, you know what?
8138160	8141240	It sounded like you said you have to crap out.
8141240	8143680	I did some of this is what you said.
8143680	8145840	Why don't you crap out some emails star Sakura.
8145840	8147800	How about you bite my butt, Rob?
8147800	8149040	Not if you're going to crap out emails.
8149040	8151720	You're the one who brought up crap.
8151720	8152720	Okay.
8152720	8155440	Dear OLR crew, long time, no email.
8155440	8160160	So I figured I would chime in my thoughts regarding the shutdown of halo two Xbox life
8160160	8161160	support.
8161160	8162160	Really.
8162160	8163160	I'm not that sad to buy it.
8163160	8166440	Seeing how I've already moved on from the game, occasionally playing halo three online,
8166440	8169560	but the enjoyment I got out of halo two actually wasn't from the online play.
8169560	8174640	I remember back in the day when me and my friends used to schedule a halo party where
8174640	8177760	everyone would bring a TV in their systems and play via system link.
8177760	8178760	It was a freaking blast.
8178760	8185500	You know, we used to do that Dan's bachelor party was a halo land party using the system
8185500	8186500	link.
8186500	8188820	Wouldn't it be nice?
8188820	8193800	What would be nice is if bungee made a halo two map for halo map pack for halo three because
8193800	8197800	honestly the maps in halo three are boring in comparison, at least for me.
8197800	8201920	Oh, how I long through the headshots on coagulation and the headlong once more.
8201920	8203880	Thanks for reading Ospher.
8203880	8208680	P.S. here's a link to a simple but really moving YouTube that you can watch in your
8208680	8209680	own time.
8209680	8214920	It's a simple walk through the multiplayer maps the game set to songs from the halo two
8214920	8215920	soundtrack.
8215920	8217720	Ah, memories.
8217720	8220640	You know, I'm such a bad, bad, bad gaming journalist.
8220640	8222760	This is why I don't go to Hawaii.
8222760	8226160	I forgot that the Xbox closure was this week, but to be fair, there wasn't anything I was
8226160	8227360	playing regularly on Xbox.
8227360	8228360	I mean, yeah.
8228360	8232160	Halo two I used to play back in the day, but most of the guys that used to play that together
8232160	8235820	with me have kind of moved on to just other games in general, you know, be at halo three
8235820	8236820	or what have you.
8236820	8237820	So yeah, that's right.
8237820	8239560	I forgot to shut down this week.
8239560	8241240	Don't say fuck halos and thrills in.
8241240	8242240	All right.
8242240	8245400	Well, what bite my butt.
8245400	8246400	You get trout slapped.
8246400	8247400	All right.
8247400	8254100	Um, but the halo two, the guy, the emailer Ospher writes says, uh, why don't they do
8254100	8256200	halo two maps on halo three?
8256200	8259880	You do have to kind of wonder now the halo two is done and gone and what have you, as
8259880	8263880	far as Xbox live goes, there's gotta be something they're going to do.
8263880	8267920	And I know there's that rumor that, Oh, halo two will be an Xbox live arcade title.
8267920	8270660	And of course there's those that saying, well, if you really want to play halo two, just
8270660	8274760	system land it or play it on PC, but you got to wonder how they're going to kind of toss
8274760	8277340	out the bone, if you will, to the halo two fans.
8277340	8282240	And I think putting out the maps and halo three is actually a really good idea, especially
8282240	8285120	if you can somehow put in the halo two rules, I don't know.
8285120	8286800	Or you just let it die.
8286800	8288920	I don't know.
8288920	8289920	We'll see.
8289920	8290920	Maybe.
8290920	8292400	But, uh, yeah.
8292400	8299160	Rest in peace Xbox live on regular Xbox, but I am so welcome to now my friends list will
8299160	8300160	hopefully very soon.
8300160	8303080	I don't know when this is rolling out, but hopefully in the next couple of months after
8303080	8306440	E3, I will be able to have a friends list with over a hundred people because I feel
8306440	8310360	really bad because I have to delete people because new people will want to add me and
8310360	8313600	I'm like, Oh yeah, I really want to have you on my list shit, but I have a hundred friends.
8313600	8315720	Okay. Who hasn't signed on in the past two weeks?
8315720	8322120	I think I'm the studio's 54 of, uh, of Xbox live cause I'll just delete people because
8322120	8323920	I've decided that they're not elite enough.
8323920	8325320	I just, I'm kidding.
8325320	8326840	I just, I feel bad.
8326840	8329920	If you're an OLR listener and I deleted you, I'm really, really sorry.
8329920	8335520	It's just my list is full and I really, I am, but just people I know in real life and
8335520	8340680	actually see outside of, you know, the internet get precedence, they get preference.
8340680	8343160	But as soon as Xbox ups the limit, open season again.
8343160	8346640	I promise you can all at me and I'll add you back.
8346640	8347640	Excuse me.
8347640	8348640	All right.
8348640	8350600	And this person's doing this just to annoy me.
8350600	8352320	So thank you for messing with me.
8352320	8354600	Um, yo, OLR, what up?
8354600	8361080	This sentience is for number four, dark Sakura to read because I'm a bad enough dude to type
8361080	8368760	like dis grammar and all around linguistics is not my for, not me forte anyway on serious
8368760	8369760	business.
8369760	8370760	I have a question for Loki.
8370760	8375080	Is it possible to hook up mix slash soundboard up to an Xbox 360 controller and play sound
8375080	8376680	clips over Xbox live?
8376680	8382520	Cause when I play call of duty or any game with multiplayer in it, you're usually dealing
8382520	8386320	with 12 year olds that one out of every two words that come out of their mouth is something
8386320	8387640	not pleasant.
8387640	8388640	Don't get me wrong.
8388640	8389640	I love expletives.
8389640	8393860	Like the fuck show was funny as shit, but not racial slurs or other bigotry.
8393860	8398800	If I can get a soundboard, I would download a bunch of sounds and just fuck with people.
8398800	8399960	Only dickheads though.
8399960	8404600	Anyway, I got to go watch all the new stuff they added on Netflix like firefly.
8404600	8406680	I heard it was really good until it was canceled.
8406680	8407920	Well, bye bye.
8407920	8411200	Duh money 125 and yeah, firefly is excellent.
8411200	8412200	Watch the whole thing.
8412200	8414120	They aired it out of order and they did it.
8414120	8417360	They just treated it badly and then watch the movie seriously.
8417360	8421720	Um, PS, this email is brought to you by orange knowledge radio, your number one source for
8421720	8424320	news, previews, reviews, and talk for all things halo.
8424320	8425320	Just kidding.
8425320	8429200	Um, isn't that ironic considering the past email we just got?
8429200	8430200	I know, right?
8430200	8431200	LOLWTF.
8431200	8432200	LOL.
8432200	8433200	I don't know.
8433200	8435840	Loki, can you hook up a soundboard to, uh, the Xbox controller?
8435840	8436840	Yeah, of course.
8436840	8441560	Again, um, all you would need to do is basically just get the right, um, connector to plug
8441560	8449360	into your, you know, Xbox 360 controller, um, to out, you know, he'd basically just
8449360	8451800	be running a cord for your PC or whatever.
8451800	8456360	I guess PC probably be the easiest and a rain into your controller.
8456360	8462640	Um, and you just need, uh, some sort of headset adapter and they actually do have, uh, one
8462640	8463840	of those I think available.
8463840	8464840	I'm looking here right now.
8464840	8469340	It looks like in tech made one of those, although I'm not sure if that just plugs, uh, converts
8469340	8475440	it to any headset or what, uh, that mean we could broadcast our show on Xbox live.
8475440	8478720	Like we can start an Xbox live party and then invite people in and we could actually broadcast
8478720	8479720	our show.
8479720	8480840	You can only have so many people in your party though.
8480840	8482400	It's like four or something.
8482400	8484840	I wish there was a way exclusive.
8484840	8488440	Could we, could we like get, just get in a halo match and just stand there or stand where
8488440	8496800	no one can, can shoot us somehow and just do our show on red versus blue style possible.
8496800	8499360	I think this though would work.
8499360	8501240	Um, I'm not positive.
8501240	8504960	It says it's an Xbox 360 headset adapter from in tech.
8504960	8515120	It says allow you to plug in any, um, uh, 2.5 millimeter Jack plug, um, and I think
8515120	8521640	I got, I don't remember, you know, what size, uh, uh, Jack plugs there are for different
8521640	8522640	things.
8522640	8528300	Um, I'm sure though, seriously though, you can probably go online or even to like radio
8528300	8531920	shack or something like that and just basically bring your controller with you and you can
8531920	8534160	probably find some sort of an adapter.
8534160	8540560	Or if you want, use this adapter with a converter to convert it to the correct, um, size that
8540560	8541560	you need.
8541560	8545920	So, um, and it does have like a volume and mute controls on there as well.
8545920	8549960	So if you want to shut it off, so you know, you're not bugging everybody, you can do that.
8549960	8550960	Hmm.
8550960	8556120	I've wanted to do that as well cause I think it'd be funny just to play stuff over live,
8556120	8559000	but uh, some people don't like that.
8559000	8562000	That's actually not the only way you can do that.
8562000	8566320	There's another way you can actually do it, um, and I've seen it happen and I was going
8566320	8569440	to call somebody to talk about it, but they're testing, I'll come back to this.
8569440	8571000	I want to come back to this topic in just a minute.
8571000	8572480	So DarkSakura, do the next email.
8572480	8574960	Oh, we only have one more email.
8574960	8575960	Okay.
8575960	8580560	So, um, moving forward, and haha, funny to money.
8580560	8585120	Rob said something like, most DS owners are kids, and this is by the way from Robaba.
8585120	8588720	At first I thought, no, but if you really think about it, what is the most kid friendly
8588720	8590260	game console around?
8590260	8593440	By kid friendly, think about these factors and not the M ratings.
8593440	8594440	1.
8594440	8595440	You can put it in your pocket.
8595440	8598960	PSP Go and the iPhone slash iPod touch are the only others.
8598960	8602320	The DS is the only system that protects its own screen without peripherals.
8602320	8603640	Very pocket friendly.
8603640	8604640	2.
8604640	8605640	Kids are destructive.
8605640	8606640	Part 1.
8606640	8609680	The portable system will probably get destroyed or lost at some point, which is the cheapest
8609680	8612440	to replace, hence its initials are DNS.
8612440	8613440	3.
8613440	8614440	Kids are destructive.
8614440	8615440	Part 2.
8615440	8618160	The games are solid state chips as opposed to UMDs.
8618160	8621920	UMDs get crushed easily, whereas the DS chips survive most falls and step-ons.
8621920	8622920	4.
8622920	8624720	Parents are cheap.
8624720	8626120	Most of the cheap games are on the DS.
8626120	8629120	I'm still waiting for Imagine Having Fun.
8629120	8630120	5.
8630120	8632160	DS has buttloads of simpler games for the very young.
8632160	8636360	I have to admit I used these priorities to pick a DS over the PSP for the nephews when
8636360	8640280	they were younger, so I'm inclined to believe you were right for your comment.
8640280	8642400	Did I send this email back in 2005?
8642400	8643720	Kinda deja vu moment for me.
8643720	8645280	Of course I was right.
8645280	8649360	Poor Jamie, I just wanted to jump through the internet time machine and buy her soup.
8649360	8650360	Aww.
8650360	8652640	I hope you were surviving your allergies slash plague.
8652640	8653640	Rubba buh.
8653640	8660600	Um, yeah, it was funny, I had bad allergies, and then, um, I was sick, I ate a lot of cake.
8660600	8661720	And beer.
8661720	8663860	And then, um, yeah, I was actually sick.
8663860	8664860	This time around.
8664860	8666920	So, thank you Rubba buh.
8666920	8670240	Thank you, and thank you for saying I was right, because more people should do that,
8670240	8671240	actually.
8671240	8672240	Say I was right.
8672240	8676440	No, but I mean, I think you further just proved the point, though, is that, you know, all
8676440	8682160	those things you named about how it fits in the pocket, you know, it's true.
8682160	8686240	A lot of kids play those DSes.
8686240	8691240	It'll be interesting to see how the three DS impacts things, if at all.
8691240	8693200	But we'll see.
8693200	8698920	If they're the right games for it, they might be, you know, it might pick up, you know,
8698920	8702760	with the other crowds that are kind of into the more hardcore stuff.
8702760	8703760	Was that it for emails?
8703760	8704760	I said there were only three.
8704760	8705760	That's it?
8705760	8706760	We're done?
8706760	8708480	Well, I wasn't listening to you, as usual.
8708480	8709480	Mailbag?
8709480	8714200	Do not, do not make me break out Shermie's butt for you to bite.
8714200	8718280	Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com She's just giving you an offended look right
8718280	8719280	now.
8719280	8720280	Is she?
8720280	8721280	Yeah.
8721280	8722280	I'm looking.
8722280	8723280	Hey girl, how you doing?
8723280	8724280	Meow meow.
8724280	8725280	She's like, bitch.
8725280	8728200	Wait, let me see if I can get a picture of Shermie right now.
8728200	8729200	Hold on.
8729200	8730200	Someone fill time.
8730200	8734920	I'm propping a logo right now because apparently people don't know the concept of sending me
8734920	8739960	an individual zip, you know, a zip file with like, my logo's already JPEG-didded.
8739960	8741960	So I have to do it all myself.
8741960	8742960	No.
8742960	8743960	Actually, I have no problem doing this.
8743960	8749080	Rob is seriously taking a picture of this little fat butt down there, looking at him
8749080	8751440	all offended, sitting on her little throne.
8751440	8752440	I got a picture of it.
8752440	8755760	I'm gonna totally, I'm gonna totally post that on the, uh, Orangeloungeradio picture
8755760	8756760	feed here.
8756760	8757760	Rob's gonna totally do it.
8757760	8758760	All right.
8758760	8759760	Look.
8759760	8760760	Oh my God, Rob.
8760760	8761760	Oh my God.
8761760	8762760	I'm gonna totally do it.
8762760	8763760	Okay.
8763760	8764760	Hold on.
8764760	8765760	Because we're getting that call.
8765760	8766760	I want to take this earlier.
8766760	8767760	This is back on the email about how do I hook up the soundboard for the 360.
8767760	8770200	So, um, I wanted to invite SSJ 100 Matt on the show to talk about this for a minute.
8770200	8771200	And there's a reason why.
8771200	8772200	Matt, you there?
8772200	8773200	Oh yes, I'm here.
8773200	8774200	How you doing, Matt?
8774200	8775200	I'm doing good.
8775200	8779720	Now, the reason why I invited specifically SSJ 100 Matt on the show is A, he's a cool
8779720	8783880	guy, but B, no, the reason why, you might remember a couple of weeks on the show and
8783880	8787120	maybe you don't remember because maybe you want to send the email if you remember this,
8787120	8792040	but I was talking about, I'm just kidding, playing perfect dark with the folks on under
8792040	8793040	sedation live.
8793040	8798280	And it was the week that the, um, Xbox live had the release of perfect dark and it was
8798280	8803200	like me and Alan were playing in one place and then, uh, Travis was playing and John
8803200	8804200	was playing.
8804200	8808200	And then some of our listeners that we have in common, like Matt, Misty and so forth were
8808200	8809200	playing.
8809200	8810200	Well, okay.
8810200	8814280	When Matt joined our game, hilarity ensued because Matt was playing these sound clips
8814280	8818320	from like Duke Nukem and like, I don't know what else is in there, like probably old movies
8818320	8819320	and stuff.
8819320	8820320	Do we have my favorite one?
8820320	8821320	What?
8821320	8822320	Your face, your ass.
8822320	8823320	What's the difference?
8823320	8824320	Probably.
8824320	8825320	Probably.
8825320	8826440	I don't remember, but it was a hilarious epic match.
8826440	8831200	So SSJ 100 Matt, you were somehow putting in sound clips and our email or what?
8831200	8834320	Our email or wanted to trash talk 12 year olds or something like that.
8834320	8835320	I believe.
8835320	8836320	Okay.
8836320	8839000	So SSJ 100 Matt, you didn't hook up a soundboard and all this stuff, did you?
8839000	8843520	No, you know, I didn't really didn't do anything that complicated.
8843520	8848360	What I got was basically something that you could just buy like in the store.
8848360	8849360	Hold on.
8849360	8850360	You're really, really quiet.
8850360	8851360	Can you get a little close to your microphone?
8851360	8852360	Oh, I'm sorry.
8852360	8853360	That's all right.
8853360	8854360	Ooh, much better.
8854360	8855360	Yep.
8855360	8856360	Yeah.
8856360	8861680	Basically what I got here is a device called the Datel trash talker.
8861680	8862680	I've seen that.
8862680	8864280	It's actually called the trash talker.
8864280	8865280	Okay.
8865280	8866280	And?
8866280	8867280	Yeah.
8867280	8872600	And not to be confused with the knockoff version called the smack talker, which is crap.
8872600	8873600	Okay.
8873600	8876600	So you want the trash, not the smack.
8876600	8877600	Very important.
8877600	8879320	Yes.
8879320	8888840	Basically what it is is a little device that connects directly into your Xbox 360 controller.
8888840	8893560	It comes with software and basically in a USB cable it connects directly into your computer
8893560	8900720	and basically you take sound clips, wave clips, MP3s and just drop it into each bank.
8900720	8911000	Now it has four banks and four sets that you can use, but it also has a preset limit as
8911000	8912000	to what you can put on there.
8912000	8917080	It doesn't say in the instructions or anything, but it will give you a small progress bar.
8917080	8919640	You can't put long monologues and things in the buttons.
8919640	8921640	There is a limit to the space on the thing.
8921640	8928720	Yeah, you can, but you can only just take up more space on it.
8928720	8929720	Gotcha.
8929720	8932360	So, I kind of want to get one of these.
8932360	8933360	I do.
8933360	8934360	I think I'm going to get one of these.
8934360	8936040	But it's a great alternative to the sound board.
8936040	8940660	You can just dump these files from your computer right onto the trash talking device, hit the
8940660	8943360	button and drop in sound clips left and right.
8943360	8944840	Your very own personal sound board.
8944840	8945840	Yeah, basically.
8945840	8949580	I mean, I don't know how it sounds on the other people's end, but according to you guys
8949580	8950580	it sounds really...
8950580	8951580	It's hilarious.
8951580	8953440	It sounds just like somebody's dropping the sound file in.
8953440	8955360	Like I thought I was playing Duke Nukem for a minute.
8955360	8956360	It's great.
8956360	8959720	I think what I'm going to do, I'm going to get this, but instead of putting in clips
8959720	8964160	from Duke Nukem and stuff, I think I'll go to the Disney channel and get clips from That's
8964160	8969400	So Raven and play those with people when I'm playing shooting matches and stuff.
8969400	8975720	But you know, it's funny, I mostly use it whenever I'm playing Mom Warfare 2.
8975720	8979560	And whenever I play the Duke Nukem clips, a lot of the younger kids, they don't know
8979560	8980560	who Duke Nukem is.
8980560	8981560	They don't understand.
8981560	8987640	So what they think is, they think it's some 40 year old guy who's smoked a packed cigarette
8987640	8991920	since he was five.
8991920	8993160	Just talking trash.
8993160	8994160	That's great.
8994160	8995160	I love this.
8995160	8999080	Act Deft in our chat room just linked us to where you can buy this thing on amazon.com
8999080	9003360	and I love I'm looking at the box art of this thing here and the guy's just got this grin
9003360	9005880	on his face.
9005880	9007480	And it's trash talk.
9007480	9009660	Taunt your opponents at the touch of a button.
9009660	9011160	Don't get lost for words.
9011160	9012160	It's bad.
9012160	9013160	Oh, really?
9013160	9016520	It has it available on Amazon.
9016520	9018760	You can get it on Playasia.
9018760	9019920	But you know, it's a little more expensive.
9019920	9022620	I think I got it for like 15 bucks.
9022620	9023620	Order in bulk though.
9023620	9024620	Just go on eBay.
9024620	9025620	I bet it's on eBay.
9025620	9026880	And warning, it's a choking hazard.
9026880	9027880	They're small parts.
9027880	9028880	But you know.
9028880	9030760	You know what, that was for real.
9030760	9032240	Okay, well, Matt, I appreciate it.
9032240	9035760	I know I asked you last minute to kind of hop on the show and tell us about that a little
9035760	9038240	bit, even though I think you might have mentioned on the show before, but whatever, obviously
9038240	9039560	our emailer didn't hear it.
9039560	9041600	So it was worth talking about again, because it was so damn funny.
9041600	9042600	All right.
9042600	9045560	Also, do you want me to mention about the Phillips thing or I'll just call back during?
9045560	9046560	Oh, sure.
9046560	9047560	What the hell?
9047560	9048560	Why don't you tell us now?
9048560	9049560	What's your rant on Phillips?
9049560	9051160	The TV question we had earlier.
9051160	9056800	Well, you know, basically like two years ago for my birthday, my father gave me an HDTV,
9056800	9058680	Phillips HDTV for my birthday.
9058680	9061800	And it had a warranty.
9061800	9068360	But after the warranty expired, the TV basically crapped out a month after the warranty ended.
9068360	9072320	So basically I had to call the Phillips, ask them what to do.
9072320	9074840	They said, basically, it's out of warranty.
9074840	9078880	We can't do anything about it.
9078880	9080760	Tough shit, have a nice life, LOL?
9080760	9081760	Basically?
9081760	9085600	Yeah, pretty much, you know, they tell you to take it to a repair shop, you know, taking
9085600	9087600	a HDTV to a repair shop.
9087600	9092280	That's basically you're going to have to buy a brand new TV.
9092280	9095920	That would irritate me to buy a new TV and then have a break just a year later.
9095920	9101640	Yeah, but you know, the problem was, you know, it works now, but I have to let it warm up
9101640	9104880	for half an hour before I could use it, which is a pain in the ass.
9104880	9109640	But it turned out that the problem was there's a short, there's a short somewhere in the
9109640	9113320	circuit board, which is common for some of their TVs.
9113320	9115400	I don't know if it's common with their current stuff.
9115400	9122320	I don't know, maybe they fixed the problem two years after the fact, but I mean, that's
9122320	9124720	my problem with Phillips.
9124720	9131920	All right, well, so noted, so I will definitely take that into consideration before I spend
9131920	9133520	a lot of money on a television.
9133520	9136320	But again, like I said before, what I really need to do is get the car.
9136320	9141080	So when I get the car, then I'll worry about the TV because the TV I have is not bad.
9141080	9142080	All right.
9142080	9143080	But we have something for you.
9143080	9144080	Oh, yes.
9144080	9145080	Matt, before I...
9145080	9146080	Oh, go ahead.
9146080	9152680	Yeah, because I'm kind of in the same position, you know, an HDTV no matter how great it is,
9152680	9153680	can't drive you to work.
9153680	9154680	Exactly right.
9154680	9155680	Exactly.
9155680	9158160	Well, Matt, before we let you go, because we got to finish up the show, other people
9158160	9162520	are calling in because they think it's a Skype segment now, oops, but before we got to get
9162520	9165720	back to the show, but I wanted to leave you with one little thing, Matt, before we let
9165720	9166720	you go.
9166720	9167720	Yes.
9167720	9174080	Your face, your ass, what's the difference?
9174080	9175080	Have a good night, Matt.
9175080	9176080	You're welcome.
9176080	9177080	Thanks.
9177080	9178080	Thanks for letting us pick on you.
9178080	9179080	All right.
9179080	9187920	What's really hilarious is to get, like, what was it, that clip from Heavy Rain, Jason,
9187920	9189480	Jason, Jason.
9189480	9196960	I remember, though, you used to be able to put your own voice macros in.
9196960	9200600	You know, like, we did one, what are you, the poster child for abortion or something,
9200600	9201600	you know.
9201600	9202600	Anyway.
9202600	9209060	What you need to do is also get, like, the CSI Miami, you know, that little musical bit
9209060	9211320	there in the beginning of the song.
9211320	9212320	Yeah.
9212320	9215080	I wonder if this is the video, uh, that dark sucker might be referring to.
9215080	9238920	I don't know if this is what video, oh, no, I was your partner, oh, that'd be awesome.
9238920	9243400	Oh, these guys are filming the TV, it's not a direct feed, let me see if this is a direct
9243400	9244400	feed here.
9244400	9245400	This is the last one, I promise.
9245400	9246400	Oh, fancy.
9246400	9247400	Screw you.
9247400	9248400	Got some shoes for Sean.
9248400	9249400	Can you watch Jason for a minute?
9249400	9250400	I promise, he won't be long.
9250400	9251400	Sure, no problem.
9251400	9258400	Oh, God, we don't know where this is going.
9258400	9259400	Jason.
9259400	9260400	Jason.
9260400	9261400	Jason.
9261400	9275200	And there's a little X with Jason floating around, so I guess you just press X to say
9275200	9276200	Jason.
9276200	9279200	Jason, you really shouldn't want her off like that, you know?
9279200	9280200	All right.
9280200	9281200	You fail at parenting.
9281200	9284320	That was, uh, that was a Flash game, too, press X to Jason.
9284320	9285320	Was it?
9285320	9286320	Jason.
9286320	9287320	Loki.
9287320	9289320	All right, there's the door, keep opening.
9289320	9291640	Loki.
9291640	9292640	All right.
9292640	9293640	Oh, bye.
9293640	9296960	All right, let's get into the FUs of the week, because sometimes we get a little angsty on
9296960	9297960	the show.
9297960	9301080	You know, when I can't find Jason, I get a little upset, so I want to do some ranting
9301080	9302080	on the show.
9302080	9305080	So here we go, the FUs of the week.
9305080	9322800	FU to being pretty sick over the past few days.
9322800	9330560	I feel a lot better today, although my voice is starting to go again, but I really, I really
9330560	9337240	not like, I enjoy the projects I'm doing, but FU to this not being my job.
9337240	9341520	You know, to me not being able to freelance full time.
9341520	9343360	I need to be a design diva.
9343360	9348840	They need to pay me for being awesome.
9348840	9352040	If Lady Gaga can do it, so can I.
9352040	9359680	If she can walk around and call herself performance art, I can put something on a piece of paper
9359680	9362600	and be called a design diva.
9362600	9364400	Would you get your own show called Designing Women?
9364400	9367200	I'd be Designing Divas.
9367200	9368200	Low key.
9368200	9373120	That show would be more interesting if it was from the perspective of, say, a grand
9373120	9375600	deity like God or something.
9375600	9376600	Designing Women.
9376600	9377600	Yeah.
9377600	9380600	It would be a weird science.
9380600	9381600	Weird science.
9381600	9382600	Awesome.
9382600	9383600	I like that.
9383600	9390120	FU to my weed eater, or weed whacker, I guess, for shooting fire.
9390120	9394960	Apparently, it's not supposed to be doing that, so it is now broken.
9394960	9398040	It was very unfortunate that it...
9398040	9400280	Weed eaters do not shoot fire, just for the record.
9400280	9401280	That's not an added benefit.
9401280	9402280	Pretty sure.
9402280	9407360	There was a lot of smoke and then fire came out and I'm like, I think this is broken.
9407360	9414680	So yeah, the engine overheated and melted down, so that's too bad.
9414680	9415680	My FU of the week.
9415680	9416680	I don't...
9416680	9417680	Actually, things are pretty good right now.
9417680	9418680	I can't complain.
9418680	9419680	I don't have a lot of negative stuff going on.
9419680	9425320	I will take this opportunity to take a tangent, though, and this is actually gaming related.
9425320	9426320	So...
9426320	9427320	Not from Sorting Glue?
9427320	9429120	No, not from Sorting Glue.
9429120	9430120	World of Warcraft.
9430120	9434040	No, I'm not giving you, my FU, to World of Warcraft, but I am a little bit.
9434040	9439200	You might have heard this week, they put some new items on sale, and you can get a new $10
9439200	9442440	pet called Little XT, which is one of the raid bosses later in the game.
9442440	9443440	Whatever.
9443440	9444440	They've done the pet thing before.
9444440	9451520	But one of the other things they decided to sell was a Celestial Horse mount for $25.
9451520	9459120	That's right, 25 real life dollars would buy you this mount in game that, you know, granted
9459120	9467320	it has its own statistics or whatever, that you can, the mount scales with you, you know,
9467320	9470440	whatever your riding level happens to be in the game is what the mount will be, and so
9470440	9471680	on and so on.
9471680	9477200	But it's $25, and it doesn't really enhance anything.
9477200	9480560	You're not getting anything special that you can't, like, earn, you know, through other
9480560	9482060	means or what have you.
9482060	9485040	It's really just the ultimate vanity item.
9485040	9489200	And I have to admit, there was a part of me that was like, oh, that's kind of cool.
9489200	9491160	I kind of want to get one of those.
9491160	9494400	But then I was like, but really, $25?
9494400	9500000	That's like almost like half of what the new expansion is going to cost for WoW.
9500000	9501960	Cataclysm's going to cost that much money.
9501960	9506400	Well, sure enough, all these stories start popping up.
9506400	9513620	The queues on Blizzard's store just to buy My Little Magical Star Pony was like four
9513620	9516360	hours long, 17,000 people deep.
9516360	9519360	You would have thought BlizzCon tickets went on sale again.
9519360	9524160	And I log into the, all I had to do to convince myself I don't want a magical star pony was
9524160	9527700	to log into the game and go to Dalaran.
9527700	9531040	Everybody has a magical star pony.
9531040	9537760	Blizzard this week cooked up free money for their game, literally free money.
9537760	9541600	It's a test because you have to understand Blizzard is owned by Activision.
9541600	9547360	Activision loves money and Activision likes putting out map packs for $15.
9547360	9550000	Mark my words.
9550000	9552280	Mark my words.
9552280	9557720	When Blizzard puts out the item, I'm whatever they want to do vanity and people are whatever
9557720	9559000	enough to buy it, then whatever.
9559000	9560000	And you know what?
9560000	9561000	I'm not perfect.
9561000	9562000	I bought the panda thing when it came out.
9562000	9565940	I kind of regret doing so after the fact, but I don't because it was charity.
9565940	9568360	So I'm like, okay, at least in the end it was charity.
9568360	9571920	But after I bought it, I have to admit, I did have a little bit of buyer's remorse of,
9571920	9573340	you know, that was kind of stupid.
9573340	9574640	Everybody has one of these pandas.
9574640	9577120	I don't, I don't, I'm not actually going to use it that much in game.
9577120	9582000	This was a stupid vanity thing, but at least it was charity.
9582000	9586040	But never again am I making that mistake, but mark my words, the minute Blizzard releases
9586040	9591680	something that does enhance your stats or does give you an enhancement or especially
9591680	9595360	something you can't get through the game through other means, I quit period.
9595360	9599560	I'm done with wow, when that happens, because as far as I'm concerned at that point, wow
9599560	9604080	has become Farmville at that point.
9604080	9607080	Tell me the difference between wow and Farmville when that happens.
9607080	9609080	Facebook integration.
9609080	9610920	No wow has that now too.
9610920	9614600	You can't play wow on Facebook, but there is an official wow application.
9614600	9620160	So as soon as that happens, which I'm afraid is now after seeing how well this pony is
9620160	9624360	done and exactly what Loki says is in the not too distant future, I quit.
9624360	9631120	I'm done with wow because it is, it's kind of insane in some ways that Blizzard probably
9631120	9637000	sold easy, a half million of these Blizzard made a million dollars.
9637000	9638000	No more than that.
9638000	9641160	Blizzard probably made $10 million this week, right?
9641160	9643360	25 times half a million would be about what?
9643360	9644360	12.5 million, right?
9644360	9646200	What will you play?
9646200	9647200	I don't know.
9647200	9648200	Something else.
9648200	9649200	Please Star Trek Online with me.
9649200	9650200	Final Fantasy 14 for one.
9650200	9651200	But we'll see.
9651200	9652860	I don't know if Star Trek Online does the same thing.
9652860	9655540	And no MMO am I going to do that with.
9655540	9659440	What Star Trek Online does, I'll tell you, and I actually like this with the Cryptic
9659440	9660440	store.
9660440	9664920	You buy points and you've got them for whatever you want them for.
9664920	9671880	What I bought was, um, I actually bought the ability to play a Klingon on the Federation
9671880	9676200	side, play a Ferengi because they've each got their own bonuses, their own special abilities
9676200	9679880	because this might be something that I want and I'm kind of a weird completionist.
9679880	9682040	But I liked that.
9682040	9687120	I liked that you could pay, you know, you could pay to, um, to respect.
9687120	9691800	If you've completely through barred everything, you could pay to respect and, and it's, it's
9691800	9693440	not even a lot of points.
9693440	9698760	I've only spent $20 in buying points and I still have some left and I've gotten all this
9698760	9699760	stuff.
9699760	9700760	They make it affordable.
9700760	9701760	So.
9701760	9702760	All right.
9702760	9706040	I gotta, I gotta give some comments in chat because there's way too good comments here
9706040	9707040	in chat.
9707040	9712400	Uh, so I should pop says everyone has one, so whatever little originality your tune had
9712400	9713440	just got lessened.
9713440	9714440	That's true.
9714440	9715680	Uh, Chad 28 says cough.
9715680	9720240	I bought it cough, but I'm super addicted in amount or do you have, my question is though,
9720240	9723520	do you have buyer's remorse now that you see that everyone has, I like the design of it
9723520	9724520	though.
9724520	9726040	I will have to say that it's a pretty Mount.
9726040	9727160	I will say that.
9727160	9730040	But when I saw everybody had one, I was like, okay, whatever.
9730040	9731800	I would rather work and get that.
9731800	9734300	The Raven Mount is so fucking Epic.
9734300	9735300	It's the best Mount in the game.
9735300	9739520	Did you, but it's a bitch, but I'm saying that this is though, no, I said, did you see
9739520	9742920	the link in the chat where they made $2 million in four hours?
9742920	9745200	God, I'm not surprised.
9745200	9749440	I do have to though, give them props for actually having a very unique design.
9749440	9751920	I mean, I haven't seen anything done like this.
9751920	9755280	Legend is that who makes an excellent point and you thought paying for horse armor was
9755280	9756480	bad enough.
9756480	9768480	If you had a problem with horse armor in Oblivion and you bought this, um, um, uh, just saying,
9768480	9772360	let's see, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, let's see, I'm looking
9772360	9773360	at here.
9773360	9776840	Um, other chat rooms, chat, that orange laundry.com.
9776840	9783660	If you want to look, uh, let's see, as 200, Matt says, NHL 10 started letting you download
9783660	9787480	additional stats to your creative player for blank XBL space bucks.
9787480	9791540	You can unlock those bonus stats in game, but they were a real pain in the ass to obtain.
9791540	9793680	So a lot of people just bought the stats.
9793680	9796320	You know, gyromancer has something like that too, but I don't know.
9796320	9799520	I somewhat give gyromancer a pass because it's not a multiplayer game really.
9799520	9802640	I mean, I guess it does have a multiplayer mode, but it's, it's more of a single like
9802640	9803640	player puzzle game.
9803640	9804640	I don't know.
9804640	9805640	It just seems different.
9805640	9808360	And by the way, horse armor does actually make sense if your horse is part of your battle
9808360	9809360	stat.
9809360	9813240	Chad, Chad 28 says, there's also a rumor going around that they're going to charge 20 bucks
9813240	9814720	a month when cataclysm comes out.
9814720	9815720	Even I will leave.
9815720	9819480	If that happens, a shower ran and chat says, it doesn't matter if Rob's done with wow.
9819480	9820960	He'll be sucking MMO cock again.
9820960	9822960	The second final fantasy 14 comes again.
9822960	9823960	That's true.
9823960	9824960	True statement.
9824960	9827200	Um, and Ziba gave a look at that link earlier.
9827200	9828200	So there you go.
9828200	9829200	Rama says, sky.
9829200	9830200	I'm going to hold you to that.
9830200	9831200	Go for it.
9831200	9834640	Um, there you go.
9834640	9836640	Lots of chat comments, chat, that orange on trader.com.
9836640	9838540	If you want to join him anyhow, sorry.
9838540	9841800	That was actually my a few of the week that kind of turned into a story of its own, but
9841800	9843440	that happens here on the show.
9843440	9846000	Sometimes we have a couple more actual stories for you guys, and then we're going to get
9846000	9851160	into, um, the calls of the week, one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype,
9851160	9852160	orange laundry.
9852160	9853160	Oh, just one minute though.
9853160	9854160	Don't start calling yet.
9854160	9855160	Cause we've got a couple more stories.
9855160	9856160	Loki.
9856160	9861720	Um, apparently the 3d games, um, are going to be coming to the PlayStation network very
9861720	9862720	soon.
9862720	9870700	Um, of course you probably seen commercials and stuff for 3d TVs, um, on TV, um, including
9870700	9876960	some from Samsung will Sony's going to be releasing their new, um, Bravia 3d TV series.
9876960	9882480	And uh, with that will be a voucher for a, uh, kind of a free collection of games that
9882480	9889000	are going to be, uh, compiled onto a, um, it'll either be a PlayStation network code
9889000	9891320	or a compiled onto a disc.
9891320	9897680	And they include a wipeout HD, uh, Microsoft or not Microsoft, motor storm.
9897680	9904640	I saw the Ms, uh, motor storm, Pacific rift, pain, um, super stardust HD.
9904640	9908800	And um, I guess those will all be available on the places you never get at the same time.
9908800	9915000	Now granted though, these aren't all 3d, it's kind of like portions of like wipeout HD is
9915000	9919780	actually supposed to be in full 3d motor storm Pacific rift is supposed to have a level that's
9919780	9926720	in 3d pain has, I believe three levels and not positive about super stardust HD, but
9926720	9933280	it's kind of like a, I don't know, a little, uh, proof of concept games, I guess.
9933280	9936360	Toa gak in our chat room says 3d is overkill out the wazoo.
9936360	9937760	You know, I kind of agree.
9937760	9938760	I don't know.
9938760	9939760	I don't know.
9939760	9944680	Then again, maybe if I play it, I'll change my mind, but I already kind of said this earlier
9944680	9945680	in the show.
9945680	9949440	I just, I don't know how I feel about everything shifting towards 3d quite rapidly.
9949440	9953680	Might I add like, it's not just happening like slowly, it's happening fast.
9953680	9956120	It feels like 3d is taking over fast.
9956120	9957120	Thank you.
9957120	9958120	Avatar.
9958120	9959120	Me.
9959120	9964320	Just saying, by the way, do you know avatars out on a Blu Ray?
9964320	9965320	What?
9965320	9966320	The 22nd?
9966320	9967320	It's a week.
9967320	9968320	But what?
9968320	9969320	Yeah.
9969320	9970960	It's just the movie with none of the goodies.
9970960	9971960	You wait till November.
9971960	9972960	Hmm.
9972960	9973960	Interesting.
9973960	9975560	Do you get the Blu Ray that comes with all of the goodies?
9975560	9976680	Huh?
9976680	9979320	This is more like, okay, here's your bone.
9979320	9984280	Well, I, I love the fact that they're marketing it with go back to the world.
9984280	9986760	Like they're not even trying to say, Hey, you should see this movie.
9986760	9988160	They're just making an assumption.
9988160	9990560	Everybody's already seen it, which is pretty much true.
9990560	9992760	And then of course there's going to be chatters to say, I haven't seen it.
9992760	9993760	I haven't seen it.
9993760	9994760	Most people at this point have seen it.
9994760	9998360	And then, um, they actually were re-releasing it for the weekend.
9998360	9999360	Really?
9999360	10007280	Um, at certain theaters for the 3d blah, blah, whatever poop.
10007280	10010560	So are you going to pick up avatar on a, or you're going to wait, aren't you?
10010560	10011560	I'm going to wait.
10011560	10012560	Yeah.
10012560	10013560	I want the extra stuff.
10013560	10014560	I don't care.
10014560	10015560	I'll wait.
10015560	10017440	I've got avatar.
10017440	10019200	I mean, I, I like the movie.
10019200	10021640	I thought it was great.
10021640	10023920	I see what you did there.
10023920	10024920	All right.
10024920	10028800	Um, let's get into one more story here and then we're going to open up the Skype line
10028800	10034920	and uh, Oh, this is a very fitting last story of the day here on orange lounge radio.
10034920	10040840	Where do I even go with this?
10040840	10048560	So there's this woman and she's from Manchester and she's talking we fit this week.
10048560	10052440	And the reason why she's talking we fit, she's blaming it because it turned her into a sex
10052440	10053440	addict.
10053440	10054440	Yes.
10054440	10057640	We fit made me a sex addict on the next Oprah.
10057640	10059240	It's this 24 year old.
10059240	10060240	Her name is Amanda flowers.
10060240	10061240	Doesn't that sound?
10061240	10064600	I have to say, honestly, it doesn't like, is this for real?
10064600	10068560	Cause isn't there a porn star named Amanda flowers?
10068560	10069560	If not, there ought to be.
10069560	10073840	It doesn't have like a very, it sounds like a horny name, doesn't it?
10073840	10074840	I don't know.
10074840	10075840	We'll see.
10075840	10076840	D flowered number 50.
10076840	10077840	All right.
10077840	10078840	Well, anyhow.
10078840	10079840	Um, okay.
10079840	10086380	So, uh, yeah, she fell off the balance board and she claims that because of the stumble,
10086380	10088280	she is now a sex addict.
10088280	10095240	She wants sex 10 times a day, the slightest vibration in the air.
10095240	10099760	She says it begins as a twinge down below before surging through my body.
10099760	10102840	Sometimes it built up into a trembling orgasm with no cure.
10102840	10105880	I just have to try to control my passion by breathing deeply.
10105880	10108520	Hopefully one day I'll find a super stud who can satisfy me.
10108520	10110600	And I'm thinking here, I'm like, is this a fucking joke?
10110600	10112600	Like is April, is April fool's still happening?
10112600	10117640	Does someone not get the memo that April fools is supposed to be stuck to April 1st but it's,
10117640	10118840	it's all over the net this week.
10118840	10123760	So I guess we have to treat it like I don't watch a lot of TV remember, but I watched
10123760	10131160	an episode of CSI I think it was at my friend's house where like this teacher had ended up
10131160	10135960	like doing it with one of the students because she had been in an accident that messed up
10135960	10140440	her brain that made her addicted to sex.
10140440	10145280	I was like, and I just listening to this like just makes me think of that episode.
10145280	10149000	I'm like, did she hit her head?
10149000	10150840	Is she just, did she fall on her cooch or something?
10150840	10152760	No, there is actually, it's a real...
10152760	10154360	Did she hit herself in the labia?
10154360	10155360	I mean what...
10155360	10156360	It's a real syndrome.
10156360	10159360	It's a persistent sexual arousal syndrome.
10159360	10161120	From falling off the wee balance board?
10161120	10162120	I mean, I guess whatever...
10162120	10166120	I hate to bring back up that episode, but it was a head trauma that did it for the episode.
10166120	10167120	I don't know.
10167120	10169240	How did they pick like things that are kind of far fetched?
10169240	10170240	Hmm.
10170240	10173280	Uh, let's see here.
10173280	10174280	Are you on the Wiki?
10174280	10180200	No, I'm on the Boston University School of Medicine's, um, sexual medicine.
10180200	10184240	I think they're a sub, uh, page here.
10184240	10191400	Uh, let's see, uh, it doesn't really say what the causes are.
10191400	10197040	Um, it's, okay, whatever.
10197040	10198400	So it's, it's a real thing.
10198400	10201000	I mean...
10201000	10202240	Head trauma and sex drive.
10202240	10207340	I'm immediately going to go home and fall off my Wii Fit board as many times as possible.
10207340	10211180	Head trauma and sex drive are connected since a person suffering from brain injury usually
10211180	10212880	has a reduced sex drive.
10212880	10215080	Um, yeah, whatever.
10215080	10218680	Frisbee says in chat, if hitting your head makes you a sex addict, how is this Nintendo's
10218680	10219680	fault?
10219680	10222680	You know, part of me wants to say this story really has nothing to do with Wii Fit.
10222680	10223680	Wait a second.
10223680	10224680	You know what this reminds me of?
10224680	10226720	And oh my God, I can't believe I'm thinking about this.
10226720	10228600	Don't worry, mama will fix it.
10228600	10234840	What was that one movie that had, um, oh my God, the guy that did Hairspray, but...
10234840	10235840	John Waters.
10235840	10236840	John Waters.
10236840	10240040	John Waters movie where everyone was like a sexual deviant or whatever.
10240040	10244100	Desperate living and they go, they get exiled to the town of Mortville.
10244100	10245100	It's really disgusting.
10245100	10246760	Like it's the most disgusting movie ever made.
10246760	10247760	Is that what it is?
10247760	10252040	Um, I don't think it was that one, but she, like they were trying to figure out a new
10252040	10253800	sex act or whatever.
10253800	10257080	Oh, oh, uh, uh, you're, it's a newer one.
10257080	10260280	It's um, uh, damn it.
10260280	10261480	It's the one, I know what you're talking about.
10261480	10267480	They had that one girl and she had ginormous tits and Tracy Ullman was in it, um, I know
10267480	10268480	what you're talking about.
10268480	10273520	It'll come a desperate, no, desperate living already said somebody in chat will get, thank
10273520	10274520	you.
10274520	10275520	Low down, dirty shame.
10275520	10276520	Yes.
10276520	10277520	Low down, dirty shame.
10277520	10278520	It's like dirty.
10278520	10279520	No, it's not.
10279520	10280520	Low down, dirty shame was another movie.
10280520	10281520	Dirty shame is the name of it.
10281520	10282520	It's dirty shame.
10282520	10283520	Anyways.
10283520	10288760	Um, it's like that because that was their kind of sex act is she would, um, cause some
10288760	10294240	sort of head trauma and then she became like a sexy deviant.
10294240	10296620	So yeah, that's right.
10296620	10298200	That was the whole point of that movie, huh?
10298200	10301280	Tracy Ullman gets in a car accident and then like suddenly she's a sex addict.
10301280	10302280	Dirty shame.
10302280	10303280	Wow.
10303280	10311280	Well, I guess it's a dirty shame she fell off her Wii Fit board, huh?
10311280	10314360	Like I said, I'm going to go home and probably try to fall off my, uh, uh, board as many
10314360	10316360	times as possible.
10316360	10318840	All right.
10318840	10323760	Skype line is now open one eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype, orange
10323760	10324760	lounge radio.
10324760	10329420	The phones are open for business while we wait for some calls.
10329420	10330720	Last minute stories.
10330720	10331720	Anyone?
10331720	10334660	Gunblade is coming to the Wii.
10334660	10338280	They're going to do Gunblade New York and LA, um, machine guns packed together kind
10338280	10342520	of like what they did with, um, house of the dead two and three.
10342520	10347960	That makes me happy because I used to play the crap out of Gunblade accuser.
10347960	10348960	I don't remember.
10348960	10349960	Gunblade.
10349960	10353200	They have like these giant machine guns that you would shoot stuff with and they would
10353200	10355600	just constantly rumble as you're playing the game.
10355600	10356600	All right.
10356600	10357600	To the phones.
10357600	10358760	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
10358760	10359760	Who's this?
10359760	10360760	Hi.
10360760	10361760	Yeah.
10361760	10362760	This is spazzing you.
10362760	10363760	Hey spazzing here.
10363760	10364760	What is on your mind?
10364760	10365760	My friend.
10365760	10366760	All right.
10366760	10367760	Yeah.
10367760	10369760	Uh, you know, you know, two, uh, two things.
10369760	10374960	Um, uh, before I get to that, I just want to say I, you know, with the life story you
10374960	10382400	read off, I can just see every guy in America going out to store right now by we fit for
10382400	10383400	the girlfriend.
10383400	10384400	Actually.
10384400	10385400	Yeah.
10385400	10386920	I was going to say, I thought you, I thought you were going to say guys are going to run
10386920	10387920	out and buy it.
10387920	10392440	Uh, actually most, and I, obviously I was joking earlier when I was talking about, I'm
10392440	10396320	going to go fall off the thing, but I think most guys already are sex addicts.
10396320	10399080	It's just that they're going to like, they're going to get this game for their, you know,
10399080	10400560	girlfriends or wives and so forth.
10400560	10406400	And then like, you know, spray Pam all over the Wii fit board or they don't even have
10406400	10407400	to do that.
10407400	10411440	I mean, obviously it's just some hard surface or something and I want to know how she fell
10411440	10412920	off the Wii fit board.
10412920	10413920	I mean.
10413920	10414920	All right.
10414920	10415920	Anyhow.
10415920	10416920	I'm sorry.
10416920	10417920	Spaz.
10417920	10419720	That's probably not why you were calling it tonight, but what's up?
10419720	10420720	All right.
10420720	10421720	Yeah.
10421720	10428840	Um, you know, you know, I was wondering if you, uh, checked out, um, you know, uh, flowers,
10428840	10434920	the soundtrack yet or no, uh, no, I, I think I do remember reading a story that it was
10434920	10438280	available, but flower had a great like ambient soundtrack.
10438280	10442560	Like that would be like, remember how we had the story earlier tonight about the, um, study
10442560	10446640	about modern warfare two versus, uh, March of the penguins and which won't make you fall
10446640	10447640	asleep.
10447640	10450480	Uh, the flower soundtrack will be a great thing to fall asleep to.
10450480	10451840	It's very nice.
10451840	10452840	Ambient music.
10452840	10453840	Is that available to get now?
10453840	10454840	Oh yeah.
10454840	10455840	Yeah.
10455840	10459600	Uh, in fact, it's been out for roughly a week and a half now.
10459600	10467120	Uh, in fact, uh, just this past, uh, Friday, I ended up picking up, uh, just for the hell
10467120	10468120	of it.
10468120	10469120	And it's, uh, pretty good.
10469120	10470120	Yeah.
10470120	10475320	In fact, I, if you were kind of touching on there, uh, yeah, I, you know, ever since I
10475320	10481840	got it, I've been using it to, uh, fall asleep to whenever I, I get a bad case of insomnia.
10481840	10486200	So which is pretty much on a regular basis.
10486200	10489280	Flower by the way, is one of the best racing games I've played in the past year.
10489280	10490280	Yes.
10490280	10491280	I consider it a racing game.
10491280	10492280	It plays like a racing game to me.
10492280	10493280	Play it for yourself.
10493280	10494280	Find out.
10494280	10495280	But I think it's a great support.
10495280	10496280	Oh my gosh.
10496280	10497280	It's a beautiful game.
10497280	10498280	It's just such a beautiful game.
10498280	10503280	You know, there was some, um, uh, controversy, I guess Ebert spoke up again about another
10503280	10505680	whole games as art controversy came up again.
10505680	10507880	He said, games are not art and they're never going to be art.
10507880	10512680	And it's funny because like every blog story I see reporting on the news issue has got
10512680	10514620	a picture of flower to go with it.
10514620	10516280	It's kind of like the, Oh, games can't be art.
10516280	10518880	A so I wonder if there'll be a flower too.
10518880	10519880	We'll see.
10519880	10520880	Yeah.
10520880	10527720	Well, we'll probably get a flower or something, uh, you know, far too or something silly to
10527720	10528720	print.
10528720	10529720	No, pretty.
10529720	10535880	She thinks, uh, all of these have been doing well, flower flows, so on and so forth.
10535880	10543240	Um, no, you know, also, um, you know, it's very, my usual day, I usually do, um, every
10543240	10549360	so often, uh, there's a one show, you know, uh, uh, discovered that, um, I think you guys
10549360	10555080	made more, uh, like, especially, um, one of the fellow, the fellow working with DJ Ramel
10555080	10556080	out.
10556080	10557080	Hmm.
10557080	10558080	What's that?
10558080	10559080	Uh, it's called, uh, Toko.
10559080	10568600	It's, um, it's a talk episode, uh, anime series, uh, that, uh, that's been out on cable TV
10568600	10575280	and it's also available on, uh, Xbox live and, uh, PlayStation network.
10575280	10578400	It's, uh, it's kind of hard to describe.
10578400	10584040	It's kind of like, um, a cross between the X files and devil may cry.
10584040	10585040	Interesting.
10585040	10586040	Yeah.
10586040	10587040	Yeah.
10587040	10594760	Yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh, well, I've seen, uh, the first four episodes so far and based
10594760	10600440	on, you know, it's really kind of the same, uh, you know, what the whole fuse is like,
10600440	10605200	but just, uh, based on what level I've seen so far, it seems pretty good.
10605200	10612920	Um, you know, there are, there are a few race here moments in there that weren't necessarily
10612920	10618600	great for the younger crowd, but, uh, but if you're holding off to handle that kind
10618600	10620320	of thing, you know, it's pretty good.
10620320	10621960	For us mature folks who can handle it.
10621960	10624920	All right, well, Spaz- Spazinator, we'll have to check that out, but for now I'm gonna let
10624920	10628400	you go, but thanks for the chat and, uh, lots of different topics tonight and you have a
10628400	10629400	good week, okay?
10629400	10630400	Yep, you too.
10630400	10631400	Take care.
10631400	10632400	All right, later.
10632400	10637920	Uh, by the way, a comment from our chat room from, uh, Seg, uh, he wants to point out that.game.company,
10637920	10641680	the people who make Flower, they don't do sequels, but they don't fail to make something
10641680	10642680	new and beautiful.
10642680	10643680	And you know what?
10643680	10644680	I'm, I'm totally okay with that.
10644680	10645680	You know what?
10645680	10649960	Flower doesn't need a sequel, um, necessarily, but, uh, it would be awesome if there was
10649960	10656040	another game kind of in that same vein, just that very relaxing, beautiful art in motion
10656040	10657040	type of game.
10657040	10658040	I don't know.
10658040	10659040	Whatever it is they make.
10659040	10660040	I hope it's next.
10660040	10661040	Um, I'm sure it will be pretty cool.
10661040	10663040	Anyhow, uh, let's go to the phones.
10663040	10664040	Hi, you're on Orange Town's radio.
10664040	10665040	Who's this?
10665040	10667760	You know, all this talk about sex makes me want to just sit here and play a couple of
10667760	10668760	age games.
10668760	10671760	Well, hello, DJ Rama S. How are you?
10671760	10673480	Hey, I'm fine.
10673480	10677040	Uh, Spaznator was talking about a show he was recommending, Toko.
10677040	10679040	Have you heard of that?
10679040	10680040	No, I have not.
10680040	10681440	Hmm, you might have to ask him about it.
10681440	10685040	He specifically said it was for you, so, uh, and us, but he said you might get a kick out
10685040	10686040	of it.
10686040	10687040	Oh, okay.
10687040	10688040	Yeah, check it, check it out.
10688040	10689040	You never know.
10689040	10691880	Well, I'm already working a couple of anime titles right now, but that's not what I call
10691880	10692880	it though.
10692880	10693880	All right.
10693880	10694880	Well, what's up?
10694880	10695880	All right.
10695880	10696880	Why did you call?
10696880	10697880	Surely you didn't call to talk about Wii Fit.
10697880	10698880	What's on your mind?
10698880	10704920	Do you remember a couple of years ago, you guys talked about a Spanish DDR movie called
10704920	10706920	La Maquina de Bahia?
10706920	10711020	Yes, sadly enough, I do remember that.
10711020	10713840	Me and my friend Jerry watched it Friday night.
10713840	10714840	Really?
10714840	10715840	Yes.
10715840	10719880	Okay, so it's a Spanish movie about Dan Stan's revolution basically, right?
10719880	10720880	Not really.
10720880	10726860	It's the campiest feel-good movie of the year, really.
10726860	10729320	Of the two years ago, because the movie's been out a while.
10729320	10730320	Just seeing.
10730320	10731320	Pretty much.
10731320	10732320	All right.
10732320	10737200	I have to ask, A, what possessed you to, of all things, watch La Maquina de Bahia or whatever
10737200	10738520	it's called?
10738520	10743600	It was sitting on my computer for about a year and a half, and my roommate was playing
10743600	10749880	FF13, and getting him off the 360 is like getting the jaws of life, so I'm like, you
10749880	10750880	know what?
10750880	10754400	We might as well just watch the movie, and it was like, wow.
10754400	10755400	And?
10755400	10756400	Was it good?
10756400	10757400	It was pretty good.
10757400	10758720	I thought it was funny.
10758720	10766000	The part of the movie is about this kid who was playing DDR, works in a supermarket.
10766000	10770680	His boss asks him to watch his pet snake, so he's like, yeah, sure.
10770680	10777000	His friends find out that he has this place on his shelf, they bring chicks over, and
10777000	10779160	they find out that the snake has disappeared.
10779160	10784820	They run up to the back, they find the snake ate a propane gas tank.
10784820	10789120	When they try to pick up the snake, they drop the snake to the ground, they're like four
10789120	10791720	flags up, and the snake is destroyed.
10791720	10794280	The fuck does this have to do with DDR?
10794280	10801640	They end up entering a tournament to win the cash money to replace the snake.
10801640	10803200	Wow.
10803200	10806360	The funny part is...
10806360	10808920	So it's kind of like the wizard, right?
10808920	10812320	Weren't they entering the tournament to graze money to run away from home?
10812320	10813320	What were they doing?
10813320	10814320	I don't remember.
10814320	10816320	They were waiting for something, and he entered the tournament.
10816320	10817320	Mm-hmm.
10817320	10818320	Right?
10818320	10819320	Yes.
10819320	10821040	I see.
10821040	10825880	So it was basically the wizard in Spanish, but with less Power Glove and more snakes.
10825880	10827760	And a lot more butterfly.
10827760	10829760	Goody, goody.
10829760	10836160	All right, so thumbs up or thumbs down to, let me make sure I get this right, La Magina
10836160	10837160	de Bailar.
10837160	10838160	Bailar.
10838160	10839160	That's how it is.
10839160	10840160	Bailar.
10840160	10842160	Yes, I'd give it two thumbs up.
10842160	10843160	Bailarvos.
10843160	10844160	Bailar.
10844160	10845160	Bailarvos.
10845160	10846160	Bailarvos.
10846160	10847160	Sorry.
10847160	10849640	I give it two thumbs up with alcohol.
10849640	10855840	It's funny, so it's hilarious, drunk, because for some reason, I'm watching a movie.
10855840	10859280	I had this tendency to point out indifference.
10859280	10861960	In the movie, I'm pointing out, this is from DDR USA.
10861960	10863680	This is from Extreme 2.
10863680	10864680	This is from Max.
10864680	10866000	I'm like, look at the different screens.
10866000	10868200	I'm like, this is from this one, this is that one.
10868200	10869200	And we're...
10869200	10870200	Ramah.
10870200	10871200	Ramah.
10871200	10872200	Sorry.
10872200	10873200	It's because you're a nerd.
10873200	10875260	You're a fucking nerd.
10875260	10877800	And I love you for it, but you're a nerd.
10877800	10882520	I mean, you're not supposed to do that with nerd movies.
10882520	10884800	It's called the suspension of belief.
10884800	10891440	Well, me because it was so campy, my eyes started looking at all the other stuff, you
10891440	10892440	know?
10892440	10893440	Mm-hmm.
10893440	10895520	A true DDR nerd till you die.
10895520	10897200	I can respect that.
10897200	10898520	All right.
10898520	10903600	Anything else you wanna talk about tonight that isn't about DDR and snakes?
10903600	10907480	Before I hang up, I want this herd.
10907480	10909720	I'm holding you to that.
10909720	10910720	What?
10910720	10911720	About wow.
10911720	10912720	About wow.
10912720	10913720	Yeah.
10913720	10914720	Okay, but I wanna make it clear.
10914720	10916280	I wanna make it very, very clear.
10916280	10917280	Go for it.
10917280	10924400	They need to put something out for sale that is basically a way to cheat.
10924400	10930640	I should say that the item sale would give somebody a clear advantage just by spending
10930640	10931640	money for it.
10931640	10934060	Because obviously, you can already pay for faction transfers.
10934060	10935280	You can pay for server transfers.
10935280	10936280	That's fine and dandy.
10936280	10937280	I don't have a problem with that.
10937280	10938640	I don't have a problem with vanity items.
10938640	10945800	I'm gonna have a problem when the item that you spend hours and hours to grind and get
10945800	10950500	and raid for that gives you the bonus stats to intellect or whatever is suddenly available
10950500	10953040	for $15 through Blizzard's website.
10953040	10954520	That is where I draw the line.
10954520	10955520	Okay.
10955520	10956520	Alright.
10956520	10959260	I just wanna make it very clear because I know how the listeners are and every single
10959260	10964120	item that comes out, they're gonna say, oh, does Rob have to delete wow now?
10964120	10967320	That's why I wanted you to say it so everyone's all clear about it.
10967320	10970440	I don't care how many magical star ponies they put out.
10970440	10971440	And you know what?
10971440	10975200	If they put out a pink pony, I might have to do it.
10975200	10976200	I'm kidding.
10976200	10977200	I'm not gonna do it.
10977200	10978200	Well.
10978200	10979200	It depends on the price.
10979200	10980200	If it's $5, maybe.
10980200	10983040	But $25, that's the other problem.
10983040	10986680	There's a big difference between 10 and $25.
10986680	10991860	Like $25 is like the price of a used game.
10991860	10994720	This just proves that people are sheep.
10994720	10996080	And I have friends that bought it.
10996080	10999800	And I feel bad saying this, you know, and even a friend, a really good friend wanted
10999800	11000800	to gift it to me.
11000800	11004320	And I'm like, no, please don't you don't you re no, really?
11004320	11006980	You really, really don't have to do that.
11006980	11013200	Like I would like, go buy yourself a bottle of vodka and a porno and have yourself a wonderful
11013200	11014200	evening.
11014200	11018600	Like I would rather you do that than buy me the star pony.
11018600	11024000	All right, anyhow, Rama, we gotta let you go try to get some more calls.
11024000	11025000	But thank you so much.
11025000	11026000	No problem.
11026000	11027000	Bye.
11027000	11029000	Bye bye.
11029000	11030800	As Anakdev points out, yes, it is a big difference.
11030800	11032600	It sure is a big difference.
11032600	11034240	I hate this Skype spam.
11034240	11036360	Look at this.
11036360	11041680	European wait, this guy, this Skype spam I got European and American women are too arrogant
11041680	11042680	for you.
11042680	11044720	Well, I know of one.
11044720	11050520	Are you are you looking for a sweet lady that will be caring and understanding then you
11050520	11051520	came to the right place.
11051520	11052880	I didn't come to you, bitch.
11052880	11055120	You're sending me a spam message.
11055120	11056120	Let's see here.
11056120	11059280	You can find a Russian lady that will love you with all of her heart.
11059280	11060720	Can't find a queen to rule your heart.
11060720	11061720	How about beautiful Russian?
11061720	11067480	I'm going to tell you right now, well, not all Russian women are sweet.
11067480	11071960	I want to point out Loki married a Russian woman, not the kind that's being advertised
11071960	11072960	here.
11072960	11073960	Just so you know.
11073960	11074960	No, no.
11074960	11075960	Big difference.
11075960	11076960	Big difference.
11076960	11083360	Nelly's an independent woman, but one more call.
11083360	11084680	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11084680	11085680	Who's this?
11085680	11088800	One and only Legend of Zaku Zaku.
11088800	11091240	What is on your mind, my friend?
11091240	11092240	Nothing much.
11092240	11097320	Just like trying to spend whatever freedom I have tonight before going back, before the
11097320	11099360	case of the Mondays kicks in tomorrow.
11099360	11101680	Wait, but you're working.
11101680	11102680	That's good because I remember-
11102680	11103680	I know.
11103680	11104680	That's the important thing.
11104680	11105680	Yeah, of course.
11105680	11106680	Yeah.
11106680	11107680	Yeah.
11107680	11108680	I remember a time you were calling into the show and you were like, I'm unemployed.
11108680	11111720	I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to do this, but then you found a job,
11111720	11112720	so all's better.
11112720	11113720	Well, I know how you are.
11113720	11117680	We all get a case of the Mondays, you know, no matter what, you know, it happens, it happens.
11117680	11122380	Even the people that are job hunting kind of go, oh God, I hope this is the week.
11122380	11123380	You know?
11123380	11124380	I know how it goes.
11124380	11125380	Right.
11125380	11126380	So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
11126380	11128380	Activision's bullshit.
11128380	11130560	That's what's on my mind tonight.
11130560	11133480	Is it the star pony bullshit or is it Infinity War bullshit?
11133480	11139400	No, it's basically their executive trying to do their best to put lipstick on a pig
11139400	11142780	regarding the whole Infinity War situation.
11142780	11148240	In particular, how he's defending that they get compensated better in Activision.
11148240	11149240	Hold on, hold on.
11149240	11154720	I'm sorry, when you said lipstick on a pig, I immediately went to that whole Sarah Palin
11154720	11155720	thing.
11155720	11156720	No.
11156720	11158360	The whole Infinity War issue.
11158360	11162040	I just, I don't know why, my mind just went to Sarah Palin.
11162040	11164880	I'm not trying to, I'm not calling her an idiom, I'm just saying she said something
11164880	11166440	about lipstick on a pit bull.
11166440	11168520	That's where my mind went.
11168520	11174120	The idea is that Activision's trying to whitewash something, you know, basically their years
11174120	11179840	of trying to milk the proverbial golden calf that was Infinity Ward.
11179840	11185240	When you milk somebody to the point of, to the point of, you know, where you saturate
11185240	11189480	the market and everything else, because that's all it is, it's mediocrity, it's a race
11189480	11192320	to the bottom, unfortunately.
11192320	11198720	And in this case, Activision tries, they basically try to, you know, they're running a slave
11198720	11204360	ship in terms of, you know, not only Infinity Ward, but other studios that have to churn
11204360	11208200	out a new Call of Duty game every single year.
11208200	11209680	Quality be damned.
11209680	11214460	Well, at the same time though, Activision, their point in life or whatever is to make
11214460	11215460	money.
11215460	11219080	And there's investors that are expecting, hold on, investors expecting them to make
11219080	11222520	money and return on investment, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah, blah.
11222520	11226880	So, you know, and all these people are quitting left and right in, I believe Activision is
11226880	11231120	based in California, which would be an at-will employment state, or wherever they are, obviously
11231120	11234080	they're not signed to contracts because they are quitting left and right.
11234080	11238120	What else can Activision do but come out and say, well, don't worry, everything's going
11238120	11242320	to be okay, even though they might be pooping their pants behind the scenes because they
11242320	11244880	have investors to make happy at the end of the day and they're going to say, of course
11244880	11246080	this will be a great game.
11246080	11250240	No, these people are just going to be better off where they're at and we're much better
11250240	11251240	because of it.
11251240	11253920	And then behind the curtain, they're like, oh, my God, what are we going to do?
11253920	11254920	All right.
11254920	11259000	One thing is basically having to meet the demands of their investors.
11259000	11262800	As a public company, they have to, but that's only short term.
11262800	11269520	What they should be focusing on is long-term returns, basically long-term return on investment,
11269520	11274960	which is really hard to do because you need to be more original in terms of finding new
11274960	11281480	ideas that would stretch out even further, making other multi-million dollar franchises,
11281480	11284040	not just milking the current ones you have.
11284040	11289600	This is the problem with not only the business world in particular, but Activision and the
11289600	11290600	fact that they're so short-sighted.
11290600	11297920	EA basically woke up from that nightmare a few years back and actually started making
11297920	11301680	more original properties, more original games.
11301680	11306560	And as a result, they're still a publicly traded company, but they have a lot more in
11306560	11311000	the portfolio in terms of actually, you know, the franchises.
11311000	11315000	And they don't basically milk them every, they don't have to meet the 10-month deadline
11315000	11317760	for new games.
11317760	11320080	So maybe this will just come full circle, Zaku.
11320080	11321640	I mean, you said it yourself.
11321640	11327160	Yeah, I'm thinking Activision has to eventually reach a point where their mediocrity is going
11327160	11328740	to bite them in the ass.
11328740	11329740	And that's a fact.
11329740	11330740	That day is coming.
11330740	11337960	The day will come when people just realize that they're getting raped, they're getting
11337960	11342880	hoodwinked every single year with the same bullshit, with the same game that offers very
11342880	11346640	little in terms of fresh, you know, new content.
11346640	11350600	I am really curious to see what happens this year, Zaku, you know, being the music game
11350600	11351600	fan.
11351600	11352600	And I know you're in this boat too.
11352600	11357340	I'm very curious to see what happens at the end of the year with Guitar Hero 6 or whatever
11357340	11362720	they end up putting out, because you know it's going to happen, versus Rock Band 3.
11362720	11365640	Because especially when you take into light this whole lawsuit and all this other business
11365640	11370720	going on right now, I'm very curious to see how the, and I guess it's come out, the Guitar
11370720	11373820	Hero 5 and Band Hero and all that didn't sell too hot.
11373820	11374820	Of course.
11374820	11381240	So I'm really curious to see if Rock Band kicks it down or what happens.
11381240	11385200	I mean, the reason, you have to give it to Harmonix, that they actually took something
11385200	11389680	that has never been marketed that well, like the Beatles catalog.
11389680	11392360	And they actually made a boatload of money as a result.
11392360	11396640	I know it was a license, but still, that was a major license right there.
11396640	11399640	Here's the first thing that they've done right so far this year.
11399640	11405440	It's been almost four months now, and we haven't had a guitar release yet this year, so.
11405440	11406440	I mean that's something.
11406440	11407440	Well that makes sense.
11407440	11412920	I mean, that and the fact that, you know, Harmonix is not like trying to claw their
11412920	11416280	way to get another Rock Band version out next year.
11416280	11421880	It's been almost what, like what, almost more than a year since we had Rock Band 2.
11421880	11426160	And all they're doing is just shoveling new content, which is good because that's, it's
11426160	11431800	better to, you know, keep people, have people continue buying the current version and then
11431800	11436720	just focusing on delivering more DLC, because that's really where they're, that's really
11436720	11441080	the heart of the game, the music.
11441080	11442080	All right.
11442080	11447320	Uh, ZakuBuddy, we're gonna let you go, but some good thoughts on that, and we'll see
11447320	11448320	what happens.
11448320	11449320	It's gonna be very, I think you're right.
11449320	11453760	I think the cycle will come full circle, and somebody else will be the big bad evil dude
11453760	11454760	next year.
11454760	11459960	At least the folks from Infinity War broke out when they had the chance, and so now that
11459960	11465600	they're back in TGA, at least this time, they're not gonna get screwed over and be whipped
11465600	11472440	to, to chunk out, you know, to turn out Call of Duty games or any new IP that they have
11472440	11473440	every annual.
11473440	11474440	All right.
11474440	11476440	Well, we will see what happens.
11476440	11480160	All right, Zaku, we're gonna let you go, buddy, but you have a good one.
11480160	11481160	Have a good one.
11481160	11482160	Later.
11482160	11483160	All right.
11483160	11485520	I think that's gonna do it for the Skype calls tonight, and somebody in chat making a very
11485520	11486520	good point.
11486520	11489080	Did you notice that like every New York listener got in tonight?
11489080	11490960	Isn't that weird?
11490960	11495120	Like I guess technically, technically Spaznator is in New York City, but he's in Buffalo,
11495120	11499480	which is still upstate New York, so, so tonight was a very New York state of mind in many
11499480	11500480	ways.
11500480	11503920	So, I don't know what you New Yorkers are doing with your phones, but y'all got it.
11503920	11505160	Even SSJ100Matt, we called him.
11505160	11506160	He's in New York too.
11506160	11507160	Go figure.
11507160	11508920	I think they just really want me to come visit.
11508920	11510120	That's what you want, right?
11510120	11511400	I really want to go back to New York.
11511400	11512400	I really do.
11512400	11513400	We'll see.
11513400	11514400	Hopefully soon.
11514400	11515520	My friend doesn't live there anymore, so I have to go.
11515520	11519920	I'll have to crash at Rama's house.
11519920	11520920	See if he likes that.
11520920	11521920	All right.
11521920	11527080	So, we are going to start to wrap up here, because it's about 9.30 here on the west coast.
11527080	11529320	It's been kind of a long show tonight, at least three hours if not more.
11529320	11533940	So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight and be on our way out of here for the night.
11533940	11536920	So let's go around and make sure there's no more last-minute stories.
11536920	11538680	I don't know if Loki has anything else he wants to state.
11538680	11541800	Oh yeah, I got lots of stuff we can talk about.
11541800	11547480	Okay, first thing we're going to start off with here is, there's a possibility that there
11547480	11550600	might be a new Castlevania game coming, apparently because...
11550600	11551600	Another, another game?
11551600	11552600	Uh, yes.
11552600	11555360	This is going to be more for like a DS title or something like that.
11555360	11556360	Three DS?
11556360	11558520	Well, who knows.
11558520	11564220	Apparently there was a trademark registered by Konami Digital Entertainment for something
11564220	11566680	with the title of Harmony of Despair.
11566680	11570000	And if that doesn't sound like a Castlevania title, I don't know what it is.
11570000	11573760	Yeah, it sounds pretty Castlevania to me.
11573760	11578240	Apparently Jam with the Band on the DS is coming to Europe.
11578240	11580640	That game was originally only released in...
11580640	11583760	Didn't that come out like two years ago?
11583760	11584760	In Japan, yeah.
11584760	11585760	Oh, wow.
11585760	11586760	Okay.
11586760	11590760	Yeah, it's never been released over here or in Europe, so they're going to be getting
11590760	11591760	that.
11591760	11595160	And with a bunch of new songs, I guess.
11595160	11606020	A bunch of covers like ABC, Chariots of Fighter, I'm a Slave For You, Material Girl, among
11606020	11607020	other things.
11607020	11613160	And, of course, some Nintendo original songs including an F-Zero Medley, NES Classics Medley,
11613160	11620600	Legend of Zelda Medley, Super Mario Kart Medley, Super Mario Medley, and Onigashima Medley.
11620600	11625600	I gotta be honest, a lot of this sounds pretty good.
11625600	11628040	And let's see here.
11628040	11634520	Nintendo has actually won an appeal against Anascape in their suit saying that they had
11634520	11643240	a patent for, I guess, the Wave Bird and the classic controllers and whatnot.
11643240	11644920	So that's kind of cool.
11644920	11648960	Unfortunately, they have been sued again by somebody else.
11648960	11659280	Now, IA Labs apparently is going to be suing them because of a fitness game, Power Grid
11659280	11660280	Fitness.
11660280	11668240	They're saying that it infringes on their patent for it.
11668240	11673640	And apparently they said that they also approached Nintendo with the idea in the first place.
11673640	11676240	That would be interesting.
11676240	11681800	And lastly, there's going to be some new Xbox Live arcade games coming soon.
11681800	11688680	Apparently, there's information leaking out from PartnerNet, which I shake my head at
11688680	11689680	that.
11689680	11698200	So, Crazy Taxi will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade, as well as Quake Arena Arcade and
11698200	11699720	some other...
11699720	11700720	What?
11700720	11701720	Quake Arena Arcade?
11701720	11702720	Yes.
11702720	11703720	Rad.
11703720	11705200	That was already announced, I think, a while ago.
11705200	11706200	On Xbox?
11706200	11710880	Yeah, it's going to have 16 player online battles with 40 original maps.
11710880	11714640	Get your trash talker ready, Matt.
11714640	11718920	Some other titles, of course, on the way that apparently are appearing on PartnerNet as
11718920	11719920	well.
11719920	11728000	Metal Slug XX, Neo Geo Battle Colosseum, Raystorm HD, Sonic Adventure DX, The King of Fighters
11728000	11737240	2002 Unlimited Match, Quake Arena Arcade, Crazy Taxi, Bali, Card Game, and Doom II,
11737240	11738240	the arcade version.
11738240	11741440	Doom II arcade version?
11741440	11745520	And the first five of those titles, if you know where they'll look, have already been
11745520	11747520	leaked out.
11747520	11755080	All right, very cool.
11755080	11756280	Lots of good stuff in there.
11756280	11758360	That's it for last minute stories then, Loki?
11758360	11759360	That's it.
11759360	11760360	We've had a really full show tonight.
11760360	11761360	It's been kind of impressive.
11761360	11762360	I'm really out of stuff too.
11762360	11763360	All right.
11763360	11764360	That's why I'm sitting on the floor again.
11764360	11765360	I know why.
11765360	11766360	I noticed you're working on your decoupage.
11766360	11767360	I am.
11767360	11768360	So I figured you had to be out of things.
11768360	11769360	Well, you know...
11769360	11770360	Are you going to take a status picture for our chatters to see?
11770360	11772080	I am once I actually have something worth the status.
11772080	11775960	I'm actually gluing, doing extra layers of glue on the back to hold down these loose
11775960	11776960	ends.
11776960	11781240	Um, I'll tell you, I'm actually, there's X-Box stuff I'm excited about coming out.
11781240	11782240	What's that?
11782240	11783240	Well, I want to play them.
11783240	11784240	We're heroes.
11784240	11785240	Ah, very nice.
11785240	11788280	I see your decoupage pictures are already up on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
11788280	11789280	Very nice.
11789280	11790280	Very nice.
11790280	11792720	They've replaced the pictures of Matt with the double down last week, which is good because
11792720	11793720	I was taking a look at that thing.
11793720	11795800	Or me with the nose pond.
11795800	11797560	Yeah, you with the nose pond.
11797560	11800880	That was really bad, but funny from that episode.
11800880	11802800	Oh, that was the week Loki missed.
11802800	11803800	Oh boy.
11803800	11806560	You should be very glad you had family things to tend to that night.
11806560	11807560	What happened?
11807560	11813840	Uh, Dark Sakura had this thing in her nose that she used for her sinus things and it
11813840	11816000	looked like she was shoving a tampon in her nose.
11816000	11821480	And so we were calling it a nose pond and I dared her to take a picture and put it on
11821480	11822720	the website and she did it.
11822720	11823760	I looked crazy.
11823760	11826920	You know that Jamie doesn't like pictures of her.
11826920	11829480	Like she's very picky choosy about what she lets out on the internet.
11829480	11835080	She's like, I'll take one cause I know I look shitty today.
11835080	11836080	Good times.
11836080	11837080	Okay.
11837080	11838080	We got to go around and get some final thoughts.
11838080	11839080	We got to close up shop.
11839080	11842720	We're running very late tonight and I know some folks want to go to bed before you know
11842720	11843720	the sun rises.
11843720	11846320	So I will start with Dark Sakura cause you're on the floor.
11846320	11848800	Uh, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
11848800	11851240	I like glue.
11851240	11852880	Loki your final thought for our listeners tonight.
11852880	11855560	Why is Rama coming to Sacramento and going to kidnap Rama?
11855560	11856560	Uh oh.
11856560	11857560	Uh, he's coming.
11857560	11858720	He's coming to stay with me.
11858720	11859720	When is he coming?
11859720	11860720	I need to make sure I'm available.
11860720	11861720	For explosions.
11861720	11862720	Is Patty coming too?
11862720	11863720	Oh, 4th of July.
11863720	11864720	Right?
11864720	11865720	Yes.
11865720	11866720	That's what we should rename it.
11866720	11870000	You know, are they going to be here for pride the week before?
11870000	11873160	Oh, guys need to rearrange schedule and get here the week before.
