00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,100
Tonight, November 7th, 2010, the new Xbox Connect dashboard is designed for pirates.

2
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,960
Capcom brings Retro Arcade to the iFamily.

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:32,400
And as Microsoft swept indie games under the rug.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,680
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of that video

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,520
game talk show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,880
It is episode number 388 of our show.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,200
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura,

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Jamie Sommers.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,000
What have you got me on Rob?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,300
It's Knights of the Old Sorority, I was telling you, or whatever this is.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,240
It's Knights of the Crystals on Facebook, but it's just sorority life for the Final

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Fantasy characters.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,440
Yeah, I'm gonna stop playing this now.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800
Oh, you're no fun at all.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,840
I'll play it after the show, I'm being responsible.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
You should concentrate on the show.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
What do I save?

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
There will be plenty of time.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
You just close it.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
It saves as you go.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,940
The internet is a modern miracle.

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,120
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Hello.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
How are you doing, Loki?

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
I'm doing fine.

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Did you have a good week off, everybody?

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
Yeah, it was fun.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
Yeah.

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
I didn't have a week off.

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Why?

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
What'd you do?

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Recorded another podcast.

33
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
Oh, yeah, you had the other show.

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,480
Hey, hey, I started a new show, too, so you're not the only one that gets to plug a show

35
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
now.

36
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
Ha!

37
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Guess what?

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
What?

39
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
We still have a thing to do.

40
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Actually, we only taped a pilot, so we're not really a show yet, because I don't have

41
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
a place to host it.

42
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Is it a pilot light?

43
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,320
Yeah, it just means, is the show gonna work or not?

44
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Go for the Frankenstein, please.

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,120
Anyway, I'll get into that in a minute.

46
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
We'll talk about other side projects in a moment.

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,720
I do want to introduce, of course, as always, our fourth guest always here with us, the

48
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,520
chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, live on this Sunday evening as we tape at All Games

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,420
Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

50
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,960
Every Sunday night is when we tape Orange Lounge Radio.

51
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,160
Anyhow, right after the Bobby Blackwell show, of course, I gotta plug Bobby, because he's

52
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,840
always been there.

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,160
He calls himself the opening act, but, you know, I don't see it as a lesser billing.

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,720
He's a smart guy, knows a lot about gaming, so tune into his show sometime if you haven't

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
already.

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,000
Anyhow, we're gonna get into How Was Your Gaming Week.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,400
It's always how they start the show.

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
We are back from a week off.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,520
One week ago was Halloween, so we just decided, you know what, let's just take a weekend off.

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,160
There's a lot going on in the real world.

61
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,120
I had a bunch of stuff to do for one of my other hobbies, so we didn't even tape a show.

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,520
You know, Logie's got the baby.

63
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,480
Dark Soccer's got, I guess, other podcasts now that are bigger than this little shit

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
show.

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
No, I have a big fat hairy cat.

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Oh, you do?

67
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Who has a Twitter?

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
I saw this.

69
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Yeah, Shermy has a Twitter.

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
When did Shermy get a Twitter?

71
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
A few days ago.

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Who signed her up for Twitter?

73
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Was that you or was that a fan?

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
No.

75
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
That was me.

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Oh, okay.

77
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,400
But she does all the typing, right?

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,500
She has me to do it because she's lazy.

79
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,200
It's Shermy O-L-R S-H-E-R-M-I-E O-L-R.

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,020
Yes, Shermy has his own, or her own Twitter now.

81
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,520
She twitched when you said his.

82
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,880
I'm sorry, Shermy.

83
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Don't poop on me.

84
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,000
It was funny.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
This morning when I was recording the other thing, she actually, I put my foot down and

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,240
she rolls over and wraps her little stubby legs around my foot and hugs my foot and starts

87
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
licking my toe.

88
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Good times.

89
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,640
That's what I have to deal with sitting in that chair.

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
She doesn't do it to you.

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
No.

92
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
That's because Rob's feet smell.

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,120
My feet are smelly.

94
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,520
Let's quickly plug the side projects.

95
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,120
Usually we'll save this for the end of the show because this was brought up a minute

96
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
ago.

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Dark Soccer, you have a side project called?

98
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,620
Comic Insanity.

99
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,020
It's Insanity without an I in the front of it, so there's only one I and not two.

100
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,200
It's at Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net and we go live on Tuesdays.

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Awesome.

102
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,640
And it's just comic books, although today we were without a Mara and Marvel.

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Sad.

104
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,560
Yeah, because she has a new house or something.

105
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
I don't know.

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
No.

107
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Hard, hard, hard.

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,400
Um, but, uh, but it's me and Tiara, Mara and Marvel and Dan Shadow.

109
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Good times.

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Who, we're our group.

111
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Who plays well with me now.

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Who plays well with you now.

113
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Yes.

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,960
But, uh, I don't play well with you.

115
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Nope.

116
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,760
You're, both Mara and Marvel and Dan Shadow play well with me, but not you.

117
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm not a sheep.

118
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
That's fine.

119
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
That's fine.

120
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Speaking of well.

121
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
I play Star Trek.

122
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,560
Speaking of well, that's my new side project.

123
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,280
Xtaphir and I have reunited.

124
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,040
For those that listened to OLR back when it was a station, before the whole merger with

125
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,880
all games some time ago, we were doing a show called Guys on a Show, which is more like

126
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,340
a pop culture thing, but now we do a Warcraft show.

127
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,920
We just did a pilot, so the first episode, the first real episode will go up this week

128
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,840
because there were some problems with the pilot, namely audio.

129
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,680
The audio quality was not that great because of some of the, we don't tape it here in the

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,080
OLR studio, we tape it in my house.

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,480
So the sound quality was kind of meh.

132
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,360
If you want to get the pilot episode, the only place you can really find it is on my

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,200
Twitter and I might have posted it to the OLR Facebook, I don't remember.

134
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,120
If I didn't, I will tonight.

135
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,720
Twitter.com slash SKIE is where you can follow me on Twitter.

136
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,360
And the pilot episode there, the show is called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.

137
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,040
I think it's very sad that it had to be explained.

138
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,760
Also known as Horde House for sure, or we just, we really call it Horde House because,

139
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,640
but you know, it's funny.

140
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,200
So that's, that's our show.

141
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
I love the name.

142
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Thank you.

143
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,000
It was suggested actually by Mel B, our old pal.

144
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Anyhow, let's uh-

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Who's at Disneyland right now?

146
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,160
I know, bastard.

147
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,780
I've been getting a picture like every three hours from Melody.

148
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,920
I hate her.

149
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Not really though.

150
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,800
All right, let's talk video games and the games we've been playing this two weeks because

151
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
it's been a little while since we did a show.

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I guess it says Guys on an MMO.

153
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,680
Guys on an MMO, kind of, kind of, because when DC Universe comes out, I know I want

154
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,960
to check that out and Final Fantasy XIV.

155
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Just kidding.

156
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
All right.

157
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
DarkShackler, what have you been playing this week?

158
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,880
I did play some Star Trek Online and finally, now that I have a shiny new headset, I've

159
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,720
been able to play on TeamSpeak with my Scottish guild mates, or fleet mates I should say,

160
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,560
and I love listening to Scottish accents a whole lot.

161
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,200
Actually, one of the other guys is I think in Holland and one of the other guys was in

162
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
New York.

163
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,040
When we're playing, we have another guy in Hawaii.

164
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,000
There's I think like three or four of us who live in the United States.

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,120
The rest all live in the UK and other places in Europe, but it's pretty fun.

166
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,560
I only get to see them when it's like before four here because then it's, you know, close

167
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:29,880
to midnight there and then I, okay Rob, don't hate.

168
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Don't judge me.

169
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Judging.

170
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,760
Getting ready to judge.

171
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Gavel raised.

172
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:44,200
I got Second Life so that I could see what the stupid Na'vi universe look like.

173
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Wow.

174
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,960
Well, it's because I, I, you are guilty of nerd-dom.

175
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,480
Oh my God.

176
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,200
Well, I wanted to see, I wanted to, I said, you know, before I actually judged Second

177
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,040
Life, I was going to see what it's like.

178
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
That's fair.

179
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,280
I guess you should try something.

180
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,440
And I figured I would go to, instead of dressing up as a big smurf and running around, instead

181
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,960
of doing, you know, I would try to do something that I couldn't really do in another game

182
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
online.

183
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,720
Cause I, I kind of, I thought it would be a great idea for them to do like an avatar

184
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
MMO.

185
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,760
I guess that thing would be lose all self respect.

186
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,560
And I've only been on it like four times just running around and going, Oh, this is pretty,

187
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,120
Oh, this is pretty.

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,480
Second Life controls like shit, just letting you all know.

189
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,640
The chat on there sucks.

190
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,520
Controls like it is.

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,440
And I, it was free, okay.

192
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,800
In our chat room, SalaciousPop at chat.orangelandrady.com says, I am jumping in front of Jamie in slow

193
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,480
motion going, no, it's a terrorist bomb counts down to zero.

194
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,820
I mean, get some self respect.

195
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:04,320
Play a Harry Potter universe if you have to, Rob, I'm just, I'm messing with you.

196
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:12,840
Well, at any rate, it's, it's not horrible, but after seeing some of the other stuff on

197
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
there, I was like, yeah, I don't really have to play this that much.

198
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,440
I've actually got a good game to play.

199
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Um, we got Rock Band 3, so we played a lot of Rock Band 3 since a few days ago.

200
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,480
We actually got it on Halloween, so we've been playing it since then.

201
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,040
Um, I'm trying to think what else, cause I've played a lot of games.

202
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Did you guys get the keyboard?

203
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Yes, we did.

204
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Have you tried it?

205
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
I don't like it.

206
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,920
It hurts my hand after a while cause I want to hold the right keyboard position and it

207
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
makes my hand hurt.

208
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,240
Oh yeah, cause you had all the, um, surgery issues previously.

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
And I can't drum.

210
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
I can't drum at all.

211
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
What do you do?

212
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Sing?

213
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Yeah, pretty much.

214
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
And sometimes I'll play guitar.

215
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Okay.

216
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,680
But even that after a while it hurts my hand, but because I, um, I play kind of like bass

217
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,520
style where you pluck up instead of strum down, it doesn't hurt as much.

218
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,480
So um, so I played that, Dan has beaten Fable 3, like within a few days of getting the game.

219
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,640
Um, my, uh, my pro tip to everybody, make sure you have 6 million gold by the time you

220
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:16,320
actually beat that part of the game, the first, by the time you're the king, or queen, or

221
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
whatever you're gonna be.

222
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,440
Um, I love all the voices in that game because, seriously, Jonathan Ross is in it.

223
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Doing announcement when you're beating up, um, monsters, and I love it.

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,280
I love Jonathan Ross.

225
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,720
He's the one with the slight speech impediment, where he speaks with the ahs and not the r's.

226
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,160
Um, and, uh, oh.

227
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,680
House Fable 3, like, similar and different.

228
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,080
Simon Pegg does voices in it.

229
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
I love him.

230
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,840
House, by the way, somebody, uh, came to Rocky, which was the thing I was doing last week

231
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
and not here at the show.

232
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,560
We had a costume contest, the winner was dressed up as Sean from Sean of the Dead, and it was

233
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,640
like A+.

234
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
It was perfect.

235
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
The guy looked the part and everything.

236
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Oh.

237
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
A+.

238
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I would have to glomp on him.

239
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,160
Um, but, you were saying, how does it play?

240
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,600
I was gonna say, how's Fable 3 compared to the last one of Fable 2?

241
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,620
It's got lots of good and lots of bad.

242
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,920
The quest thing, instead of being able to just change your quest and thing, you don't

243
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,240
even have a menu anymore.

244
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,560
You go back to this sanctuary, and, um, and then if you're trying to find a person to

245
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,080
start a particular quest, it doesn't always teleport you right to them.

246
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,400
Oh, Rob's gonna give us diseases.

247
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Sorry.

248
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
No.

249
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,440
I have stuff going on, I have to do eye drops every three hours.

250
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Rob's a zombie.

251
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
It's time.

252
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Yeah, I'm a zombie.

253
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Brains.

254
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,640
Um, but, no, it's-

255
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Navi!

256
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Shut up.

257
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,560
But, uh, it's not bad.

258
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,320
I mean, there's definitely some, a lot of glitchiness in it, and you know what really

259
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,760
sucks is that when you have to take people places, you can't just tell them to follow

260
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
you.

261
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,360
You have to hold their hand and take them with you.

262
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,960
And that's really irritating.

263
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,560
And also, I can see the seam on the dog in the textures, and it's kind of, meh, creepy.

264
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,800
Dogs do have seams, though.

265
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,740
Yeah, but not like that.

266
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,280
Not from the top of their head to the base of their tail.

267
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Sure they do.

268
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
No.

269
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,080
He'd be expecting to see stitches or something.

270
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,880
And then there's like a bunch of annoying people.

271
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,780
I love one of the quote bad guys in the game, Reaver.

272
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,520
He's just so ostentatious, I love him.

273
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,520
And he's so evil and such a bastard, I love him to death.

274
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,960
And then I played Robot Unicorn Attack in the middle of Starbucks at 11 o'clock last

275
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
night.

276
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,640
And we had one of mine and Dan's friends over beat Little Nemo, the Dream Master, on Nintendo

277
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,320
in our vault last night.

278
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Wow, random.

279
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,440
That game's actually kind of hard, you know?

280
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,240
God, I played a bunch of other stuff, too.

281
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,960
I beat Peggle Knights.

282
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,820
It's actually kind of hard.

283
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,000
It's harder than the first Peggle.

284
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,120
Lots of Plants vs. Zombies, I've almost done growing my tree of life.

285
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,440
Or whatever, the tree of knowledge or whatever the crap the tree is.

286
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,120
Is the tree of worthless advice is what it is.

287
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,440
Okay, then.

288
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,720
Stuff I've already figured out, but you get an achievement for it, so whatever.

289
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,080
And for anyone who has beaten mustache mode, all you have to do is just type mustache while

290
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,440
you're playing and all the zombies will get mustaches and you'll be in mustache mode.

291
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,760
Kay.

292
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,960
I know, it's completely retarded.

293
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,480
I love how stupid that game is.

294
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,040
And I know I played a bunch of stuff this week.

295
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,560
Oh yeah, and I played Dance Masters tonight.

296
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
And I did Pala Pala.

297
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Dancing.

298
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,560
What did you think of Dance Masters on the Xbox Kinect, the other dance game?

299
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,960
I liked Para Para.

300
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,960
I know, that Night of Fire you were doing was just the Para Para dance.

301
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,480
And you were playing on easy mode, so it was less restrictive.

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,240
You only had to get like one out of every eight beats right.

303
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,040
I'm imagining the harder levels are like really kinda picky.

304
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,480
I don't know, I think I remembered it pretty well, so I should be able to do it on hard.

305
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,840
You did pretty good for what it looked like.

306
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
Yeah.

307
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
What did you think of the Kinect as a device?

308
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
You were watching Loki and I playing it a little bit.

309
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,480
I thought it was freakin' hilarious.

310
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:30,400
Especially, okay, they were playing Dance Central and there's like this little solo

311
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,700
freestyle part in it and Rob was going in and shaking his butt and jumping up and down.

312
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,840
And then it plays back in high speed, so you see Rob peeking out, Rob peeking out, Rob's

313
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,280
butt.

314
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,120
And you just see Loki kind of flailing, because he was actually doing stuff, but when it speeds

315
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,640
it up it looks like he's flailing.

316
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,800
Kind of what the Kinect is, it's the Microsoft flail.

317
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,480
Yeah, the Microsoft flail.

318
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Good times.

319
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
I like that.

320
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
That's what I'm going to call it for now on.

321
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,200
Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

322
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Bam!

323
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Which is what I'm going to take a picture of.

324
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Alright, you do that.

325
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
A little Para CD.

326
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,040
No, Dan and I found a bunch of our video game soundtracks, so we've been ripping them, and

327
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,080
I found a VCD of Para Para Panic, volume 2 and 3.

328
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Good times.

329
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,840
I also found a Para Para DVD that belongs to Loki.

330
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Random.

331
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,480
The Para Para Master.

332
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Loki's like, that ain't mine.

333
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Para Para Master?

334
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,800
Yeah, you loaned it to me like five years ago.

335
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
I don't even remember that.

336
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Hold on.

337
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Alright.

338
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Okay, everybody else.

339
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
Going to the chatroom real quick, Spaznator in our chatroom says, if someone were to put

340
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
Abba, our Rocky Horror Picture Show, Dan Central, and Sing Star into a blender, and then puked

341
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,680
out the resulting game, Sky would probably squeal.

342
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,560
Uh, yeah, probably.

343
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,760
Let's see, uh, ssta100matt, this has nothing to do with video games, whatever, we'll entertain

344
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
this.

345
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,740
He says, by the way, I want to hear Rob's review on the Glee Rocky Horror Picture Show

346
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
episode.

347
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,120
Okay, so ssta100matt wants to hear my review on the Glee Rocky Horror Picture Show episode.

348
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,160
Here you go, it stinks!

349
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,040
It was okay, I guess.

350
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,000
I like the message at the end, but otherwise it's kind of censored and dopey.

351
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Alright.

352
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What is this?

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a kid's bot.

354
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,960
Alright, uh, Loki, you want to talk about- This must have been something I got for free

355
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,800
back when I was wearing VCDs, because I remember this, get VCDs dot com, special price, must

356
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
have been free.

357
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,280
Um, yeah, stuff that I- Hi, you're gaming week, yes.

358
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,880
Stuff I played this week, of course I got the Kinect as well, a little bit earlier than

359
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,400
most because I like hunting on eBay sometimes.

360
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:43,680
Uh, with it came with actually one of the new S systems, so I have a nice new slimmer

361
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
system.

362
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,280
Um, so I've been playing a few things, you know, Kinect adventures a little bit, which

363
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,120
is, you know, it's a kind of fun pack-in game, I guess.

364
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
You know, pretty basic stuff on there.

365
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,280
Um, I started off playing some of the demos for Joyride and Dance Central, and really

366
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,720
the demo for Dance Central, which is on the disc, so, um, you know, if they put it on

367
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,360
Xbox Live Marketplace, you don't really need to download it because it's already on the

368
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
disc.

369
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,040
Um, it's only got two songs on the demo, which were, um, Poker Face by Lady Gaga and Poison.

370
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:25,280
Um, Poison is a lot more difficult than Poker Face, that's for sure, because I'm like,

371
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,760
okay, Poker Face, that was really easy, I'm gonna go in the Poison, and it's like, okay,

372
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,520
break it down, do this.

373
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,320
I'm like, I can't do that.

374
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,560
You know, some 90s dance moves and stuff, but I think actually if you play through,

375
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,720
um, Dance Central, through the songs in the actual order that they're in there, uh, from

376
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,240
easiest to hardest, I think it'd be a lot easier to pick up some of the stuff, because

377
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,920
some of the moves are just, it's a little tough for me to wrap my brain around it.

378
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,680
Um, but yeah, it's a fun game.

379
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,400
Um, played Dance Masters a little bit, um, or I should say I watched Dance Masters a

380
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,680
little bit, because the thing that's really frustrating about that game, although I have

381
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,240
to say I didn't try the lesson modes, so maybe that breaks it down a little bit more, but

382
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,520
it basically says, okay, go.

383
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,440
And then it starts doing stuff and you start messing up because you don't know what the

384
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,960
hell you're supposed to be doing, and that's it, and you just act confused, unless of course

385
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,440
you've played lots of Para Para, and you know some of the Para Para dances, in which case,

386
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,720
there's at least four songs you'll be able to do just fine, um, but the rest of them

387
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,400
are just very confusing.

388
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,160
A lot of songs from DDR, a ton of songs from DDR, um, everything from, you know, the Para

389
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:49,680
Para songs to, uh, Sakura, Exotic Ethnic, uh, Let the Beat Hit Em, um, Keep on Movin',

390
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:56,040
um, Higher, I'm trying to think of some of the other songs that were in there, um, but

391
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,240
yeah, a lot of DDR stuff, and honestly, as Rob was saying when, um, he was actually looking

392
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,360
at the game, the game looks a lot better than Dance Central.

393
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,440
Yeah, I was surprised, Dance Masters is actually like a better looking game than Dance Central,

394
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,440
like it, just the inter-, it, the way you watch it play out is a lot cooler than those

395
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,400
little like flashcards going up the side.

396
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,020
I think the flashcards going up the side makes the dance like impracticality, like you said,

397
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,280
it's easier to learn that way, whereas it's just kind of like throw it in and do it, but

398
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,880
like if you're just kind of like trying to show off the poses and stuff, I think with

399
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,000
like the silhouettes collapsing in and the rings that show up, I think the game looks

400
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,600
awesome, and like I think if you were to like pull it off the way you're supposed to, which,

401
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,280
I know some folks might be surprised, they were expecting me to come on here and say

402
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,640
Dance Masters is full of fail, but there's some interesting parts in there, like I think

403
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,520
that the interface itself is pretty sleek when you're playing the game, I like the look

404
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
a lot.

405
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,120
It's interesting, you know, as far as like some of the songs that are in there and stuff,

406
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,440
because I think it'd be fun to see what the routines are for them, um, obviously, and

407
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,440
this goes for both games, there are some songs like, for example, Poker Face and stuff that

408
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,960
I would feel like an idiot doing, you know, in real life versus, you know, some of the

409
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,040
songs, you know, like Poison and stuff that have really good dance steps to them, I mean

410
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,960
obviously they have the simple, you know, have some simple songs in there so you can

411
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,120
learn, because, you know, a lot of it is like, oh, I could do that, but it's actually really

412
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,160
hard sometimes to figure out what they want you to do, and you have to kind of do it a

413
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,280
few times to be able to understand what you need to do in the game, but, Dance Masters,

414
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,340
the other thing I don't like about Dance Masters is the actual menus, the way they have you

415
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,160
navigate it is not very intuitive, and a lot of times they end up selecting things they

416
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,520
didn't want to select, um, was it Dance Central? No, Dance Masters, I have problems with Dance

417
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,360
Central, I don't know if that's just the Kinect device itself, but, like, trying to select

418
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,440
a song is a pain in the ass sometimes on Dance Central, yeah, um, the thing with Dance Central

419
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,120
though is you can actually use the controller to select stuff if you want to, oh, didn't

420
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,560
even try it, derp derp, um, so that's kind of neat, um, and then other things, can I

421
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,520
say this real quick though about Dance Central, some of those moves are kind of embarrassing

422
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,920
too, this is Dance Central, again, we've been kind of going back and forth between the Dance

423
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,520
Masters, yeah, they are, here's the easiest way to remember, Dance Central has real songs,

424
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,440
Dance Masters has DDR songs, like, which, you know, I realize some people consider them

425
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,240
real songs, I don't mean to, you know, spit in the eye of what we grew up on, but it's

426
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,160
not music you're gonna hear out in the real world, if you're a fan of DDR, and you know,

427
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,160
you buy Dance Masters, you probably think, oh, originally you're like, okay, well I know

428
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,540
Para stuff is gonna be in there, and you think, oh, it's just all Para Para dancing, well,

429
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,480
they have, like, a lot of songs from DDR, and it was kind of cool to see a lot of stuff

430
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,320
on there, but there's really only a couple songs that weren't in DDR, or at least I didn't

431
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,800
recognize in DDR. I think though, those of you guys that, like, grew up on DDR, and have

432
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,160
been playing for years and years, ever logged into, if you had an account on DDR Freak at

433
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,420
any point in time, go buy Dance Masters, the rest of you, get Dance Central, that's, that's

434
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:04,280
really how it kind of breaks down. Dance Central I like because I've, long time ago, I actually

435
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,080
took a dance class, and the way they teach you how to do the different routines is the

436
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,560
way you would learn it in a dance class, which is kind of cool, so I enjoy that game a lot

437
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,680
more because it actually, you get an idea of what you're supposed to do, even though

438
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,860
they do have the flashcards, if that's not for you, if you just wanna, you know, you

439
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,060
know the routine, you just wanna do it, you can turn those flashcards off. Anybody who's

440
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:32,120
ever loved Para Para Paradise or even liked it, you need to get Dance Masters, because

441
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,100
it basically is Para Para Paradise under a different name, and just a different gameplay

442
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,800
mechanic, but like, the Night of Fire dance is the same dance. Yes, it is. You know, so,

443
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
it's something, remember, like way back in the day, I was like, hey, know what'd be kind

444
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,000
of cool is if they had a Para game with like, you know, different genres of music in there,

445
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,280
not just Para Para, that's Dance Masters, it's basically, funny, you know. Let me go

446
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,000
back to Dance Central for a minute, because Loki was talking about some of the embarrassing

447
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,040
dance moves that happened in that game, and I'll tell you, I don't know if you've, have

448
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,240
you played, you haven't really played the demo, outside the demo, huh? Not too much,

449
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,200
no. Okay, I was playing the full version, I was playing, there's a song by M.I.A. called

450
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,120
Galang, and I don't know if you've ever heard this song, but let me play a little bit of

451
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,320
it for listeners here in, listening to this song. This is an awesome song, yeah, I really

452
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:24,320
like this song, but like, the way you dance to this song, is like, you like, hop, bend

453
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,840
over, shake your butt, it's like, like the dance you're doing is like, really embarrassing,

454
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,360
but, it's kinda, I, when it all comes together, I think it looks pretty cool. Dance Masters,

455
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,080
supposedly, and I haven't actually checked it out yet, I think there's a way that you

456
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,320
can actually customize, like, the dances in there, like you can create your own, like

457
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,680
an edit mode almost. Dance Central? Dance Masters. Oh, I can't tell them apart! Dance

458
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,280
Central, I'm surprised that they didn't have that, because they have all the moves broken

459
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,400
down, you should be able to just order them in a way, you know, to create a routine, and

460
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,480
it wouldn't be that difficult for the actual on-screen dancers to follow it. Dance Central

461
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,440
is very much a first game, as is Dance Masters. I mean, you have to go, okay, Dance Central

462
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,880
is like the first Guitar Hero game, which led to Guitar Hero 2, which led to Rock Band

463
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,120
and Guitar Hero 3, which led to, you know, where we're at now with, like, Rock Band 3.

464
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,320
So the potential is there for something really cool, but this first game is definitely like

465
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,000
a bare bones thing, but it'll, it'll be a hit at parties. Either one will be, really.

466
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,960
It'll be pretty fun. Other things I played, Connect Joyride, which I enjoyed, you know,

467
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,520
some people have trouble controlling the game, but I actually had no problems with it, and

468
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,320
I actually thought it was pretty fun, and I played the demo that was on the disc and

469
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,800
I ended up buying it. A couple reasons why I bought it, one, because it looked fun, and

470
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,200
two, it was one of the games I was able to get early. And then also Connect Sports, which

471
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,160
I actually haven't touched yet, so I can't really give any impressions on. I do still

472
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:06,200
want to get possibly yourself fitness, or your shape fitness, or whatever the hell it's

473
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,960
called, just to try that out, because right now, I mean, I can't get out to the gym even

474
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,760
if I wanted to. There's just no time of the day, and I think it would be nice to have

475
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,840
some sort of exercise program, and honestly, I would prefer getting the EA Sports Active

476
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,920
2.0 one, because it looks like it's a lot more structured. They actually have a nine

477
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,840
week program you can go through, and a bunch of neat features for that. The problem is

478
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,240
it's 100 bucks, and I really don't want to spend $100 on a game, even if it does work

479
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,560
out pretty well, but I don't know. It would be neat to just try that stuff, because it

480
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,320
looks like that might work pretty well. But yeah, I'm looking forward to more stuff. Hopefully

481
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,880
they actually start having indie games, and Xbox Live Arcade games that support Connect

482
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,680
stuff, and hopefully we get into some more different types of games other than stuff.

483
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing the different genres, you know? Okay, because

484
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,760
all the games that are launched are like dance, fitness, interpretations of Wii games from

485
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,880
their launch party, but we have yet to see how is Connect going to affect Gears of War,

486
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,480
if at all. Like, I'm not, please hear me out, I'm not saying every game needs to have Connect

487
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,760
shoved in it. In fact, that would make me very disappointed. But I'm saying like a Gears

488
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,480
of War-esque kind of series that uses Connect. And I don't think you need to go too crazy

489
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,200
with some of that stuff. I think it would be neat to have a game where you play it on

490
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,640
the couch, it just supports Connect, but you're still using the controller. Say for example,

491
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,120
you're peeking around a corner or something, you just lean with your controller in hand,

492
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,160
you lean to the side and your character peeks around the corner instead of you having to

493
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,160
hit a button or something like that. Just really, you know, subtle stuff. I don't think

494
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,080
you need to actually flail around or something, but I think adding a little bit of extra stuff,

495
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,360
you know, or maybe like voice commands to different things might be kind of neat. Just

496
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,280
do it tastefully, you know? Don't have like, Halo Connect, you know? And something you

497
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,080
touched on a little bit there that I wanted to definitely mention and expand on a little

498
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,560
bit is the more minority report style stuff that's in the Xbox Connect, meaning that it

499
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,640
will identify your face and sign you in. If you have to calibrate, you have to go through

500
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,320
this somewhat extensive calibration in Connect ID, and for it to work really well, you have

501
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,680
to do it like in the daytime, in the nighttime, with all your lights on, with some of your

502
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,040
lights on, you have to do it a few times. But if you do, then when you go into the Connect

503
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Hub, which you can do just by yelling at your Xbox, Xbox, Connect, and it will go into the

504
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,640
Connect Hub. And if it can see your face, it will scan and it will go, oh, hey, Rob,

505
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,680
what you doing? You know, not really like that, but you know, it'll, it'll, hey, Rob,

506
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,920
what you doing? Hey, girl, what it do? No, it's not going to do that, okay? It's just

507
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,560
like, but it'll, I will not have to pick up a controller at all. In fact, I have gone

508
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,040
so far as to eject the game, put in the new game, walk away, and then it'll go Xbox, Connect,

509
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,760
close tray. And it knows who I am, starts, and closes the tray. I mean, it's, it's kind

510
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,280
of scary in some regards, but neat. I want to see that expanded on though, because it's

511
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,160
very limited right now. There's only very certain commands. Like, you can't be like

512
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,480
Xbox, paint my house. You know, it's not going to, it's not going to know how to do anything

513
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,000
but like close the tray and go to your friends list, you know? And then also, you know, like,

514
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,840
the fact that actually those voice commands work with pretty much anybody. You know, my

515
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,720
wife is like, you know, yelling stuff out. She's like, haha, I can hear fear through

516
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,520
your stuff without having to steal your controller. I can run in front of you and the game detects

517
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,520
me and it'll screw up your game. Haha. I heard though, it doesn't see people behind you.

518
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,680
It doesn't see people behind me. She runs in front of me. Oh, okay. And it sometimes

519
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,400
does that and sometimes it, sometimes it won't even get confused at all. It's just, it's

520
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,920
really interesting. The other thing, completely unrelated to actually playing Connect games,

521
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,000
which this isn't really a feature for a lot of people, but for me, since I have an infant

522
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,720
it is, the nice little calibration cards that come with a lot of the games that are high

523
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,520
contrast, black and white, it's a little... What do they do? It's for calibrating the

524
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,800
system. I have yet to use them. Well, you can use it to calibrate the system. It takes,

525
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,000
it's a little smiley face and it says, you know, place this so that the glasses are on

526
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,440
the smiley face and you see, you move it back and forth and it calibrates the sensor that,

527
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,320
you know, get distance or whatever you're running. Where is that? What do you, in the

528
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,480
dashboard? Uh, and then the little connect dashboard thing. I've done it once. Anyways,

529
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,560
but that's not the point. The point is my son loves staring at that thing and just like

530
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:50,560
plays with it and just like, and smiling is so happy, is literally his favorite toy. Loki,

531
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,640
I'm just saying you could go get like a little piece of cardboard at Target for like 10 cents

532
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,960
and a Sharpie marker. You can make a million of those. Oh, I know that, but I'm just saying

533
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,880
it's, it's an added bonus because they, they come with a bunch of them. Cause I, I got

534
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,680
it and you know, with it and says, do not throw this away. I'm like, the hell is this?

535
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,640
Um, so you know, do I have to hold this in front of the camera? And Bobby Blackwolf in

536
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,560
our chat room is, is echoing you. It's in the connect tuner on the connect hub. I thought

537
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,480
I went through that setup. So there's a whole nother calibration. There's another calibration

538
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,600
set up. There's a lot of calibrating to do with this, but it's been working fine without

539
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,480
all that fine calibration except the fact that I live in a tiny apartment and don't

540
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,840
have a lot of space. Yeah. That only means that you can't play connected ventures to

541
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,120
player because it requires not going to have feet, you know, or whatever in order to play

542
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,880
two players on that. A lot of the other games don't do, you know, really give a crap. In

543
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,280
fact, you know, I'd say, you know, Jamie's living room here. That mean that was maybe

544
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,160
like six feet. Yeah, it worked. If that it was just fine. I had no problem with it. Just

545
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,400
a little para para. Yeah. It's just connected ventures I think is really, I don't even know

546
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,160
if it necessarily needs that. It's just that they don't want you smacking into each other.

547
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,400
Yeah. Have you done the video chat at all? No, it's really creepy. Try it because the

548
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,300
connect will follow you around. Like I was sitting in the chair, like I wasn't actually

549
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,240
chatting with anyone, but you can see your window. And then like if I, if I stand up,

550
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,240
like the connect follows me and if I kind of move it, like it follows you around, which

551
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,280
is kind of creepy. You can only move up and down, right? Yeah. But well it also will zoom

552
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,440
in and pan left and right as it zooms it. Like it's zooming in on your face. Yeah. It's

553
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,960
kind of, kind of creepster, but cool. I liked it. I'm going to chat room and some comments

554
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,600
at chat.orangelandtrady.com. Um, Oh yes. Marissa con gusto in our chair and says, I do not

555
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,960
want a system that hits on me or notices if I have gained weight. Oh, that would be a

556
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,480
terrible wouldn't it? You know, X-Box connect. Hi Rob. Oh, you might want to stop eating

557
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,040
donuts. I thought they were having a feature or there was something, maybe it was in the

558
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,920
one of those, like, you know, here's what it possibly can do, you know, or I'm scanning

559
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:54,000
my skateboard and that bullcrap. Um, where like it could scan your image and it makes

560
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,660
an avatar character out of that. Well, what's also going to be interesting is what future

561
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,560
firmware updates will do because the technology is there now. Now it's about really kind of

562
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,400
squeezing out the potential of it. I'm kind of curious to see what next year's update

563
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,800
will bring because probably more of this stuff. Browsing, it won't probably be just like you'll

564
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,340
be able to browse the marketplace or something like that. Dance masters fact sheet. Apparently

565
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,040
there is a lesson mode. Yeah, that would be nice because stepping right into the dance

566
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,860
mode is like, huh? Yeah. All right. Anything else for your gaming week? Um, yeah. Other

567
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:31,560
than X-Box and connect stuff, um, well actually I played rock band three briefly. I just got

568
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,880
around to it. So one of my systems actually died on me and I had it fixed. So, um, that

569
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,380
was nice. And, um, I played, well, I spent a lot of the time just recreating my band,

570
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:49,440
the uh, what was it? Unfit barf bags because that was the random, that was the random band

571
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,640
name he gave me in rock band two. And so I just stuck with it and it was funny. Um, actually

572
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,160
they had something about like, it was one of the first random names he gave me. It was

573
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,000
like talking about parakeets or something like that. I thought that was fancy. Ah, that

574
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,300
is a close second there. Good name. Just talk about parakeets. Uh, but anyways, so I ended

575
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,680
up playing, um, you know, the power of love on, um, the keyboards because I had to try

576
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,900
that out and it was awesome. Um, and then, okay, then other than was relatively easy

577
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,380
for keyboard though. Yeah. And I, of course I didn't bother doing keyboards in normal

578
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,200
mode because that's just retarded with the five keys. Um, I stuck with the pro mode and

579
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,560
just, you know, stick with easy. Well, if you actually want to be able to play things

580
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,880
like Bohemian Rhapsody, you got to do five key. Well, why can't you just play it on easy?

581
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,460
Oh, okay. Yeah, you can do it on easy. I mean, you can do easy in promo that I think that's

582
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,840
the way to do it. Um, but I've done a little bit of both. Like I can, I can actually be

583
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,120
just like heaven and imagine on like expert pro keys, but it took a little while to kind

584
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,000
of get there, but it's cool that I can do it after practicing. I had problems with,

585
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,640
you know, um, lining up my hands because you know, it like for example, the power of love

586
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,360
is more on the right side of the keyboard. And so I see stuff come down the center of

587
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,080
the screen. I'm thinking, Oh, hand in the center of the keyboard and it would be lined

588
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,360
up normally like if I was playing keyboard mania or something like that. But I had my

589
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,940
hands too far to the left. So other than that, other than Grand Theft Auto, um, some iPod

590
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,840
games have been playing or iOS games, I guess, um, mainly stick wars, which I mentioned was

591
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,720
kind of a rip off of the game defender castle. It's basically a game where you flick a stick

592
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,280
figures up in the air and kill them. And, uh, kind of a tower defense game. And of course

593
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,600
the other tower defense game also involving stick figures I've been playing was, um, cartoon

594
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:45,040
wars two, uh, tried that, tried a little bit of Sonic for episode one on the iPod. And,

595
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:53,040
uh, it's terrible as I figured it would be. Thankfully I didn't buy it. Um, and what else?

596
00:33:53,040 --> 00:34:00,160
Um, Oh yeah. A little bit of a space invaders, uh, infinity gene, which I love that game.

597
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:06,200
It's pretty awesome. Um, that's pretty much it. Okay. We, I know we've been on the gaming

598
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,840
weeks for a while. Let me talk quickly, but we had a connect launch this week and a few

599
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,600
of us played it. Um, I had some, uh, stuff going on where I wasn't able to leave the

600
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,880
house this weekend. Long story. I don't want to get into it. Um, but I bought a connect

601
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,000
to hold me over. So I've been playing a lot of the same stuff we've already talked about

602
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,300
dance central, um, which is fine, but I, the interface bugs me like it doesn't control

603
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,840
very well, but now that I know about this extra calibration stuff, maybe I need to try

604
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,800
that. So now that I know and knowing is half the battle, um, I'll, I'll try that a little

605
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,480
more. But otherwise, like the dancers are kind of fun and it's a pretty good workout.

606
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,560
And that's, that's the best thing about connect is that it's a, it's a good calorie counter

607
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,520
for that. I noticed. Yeah. Oh yeah. I turned it on. It's, it's a good, um, the photo modes

608
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,760
a little creepy. I think I might need to turn that off cause I'm like, I don't like being

609
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,760
required to wear pants to play Xbox. You know what the connect adventures stuff, you know

610
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,200
how there's that connect share.com website. Yeah. Like I'm afraid that one day I'm going

611
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,360
to be sitting there playing with no pants on cause you know, look, it's the privacy

612
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,600
of my own house. Come on guys. You know, pants are restrictive. So sometimes you'd like to

613
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,400
play with no pants. So I was playing in my pajamas. Yeah. That's what I'll do now because

614
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,400
I am like deathly afraid that the machine is going to take a picture of me and like

615
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,760
upload it to my Facebook without me knowing. And I, I realized this is a totally irrational

616
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,020
fear and like, yes, these modes can be turned off, but come on. Like it's, it's like this,

617
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,160
this part of technology kind of freaks me out or it's like suddenly, you know, everybody's

618
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,960
going to know if it's boxers, boxers or briefs, you know, and I don't, there's certain things

619
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,560
that my Facebook friends do not need to know about and what color I'm wearing today is

620
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:50,400
one of them. You know what I mean? Yeah. So anyhow, I don't want people to see my completely

621
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,400
mismatched and way too big for me. Pajamas. That's like, that's, you know what, it's the

622
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,680
equivalent guys with pants are like women with bras. Like most women I talk to are like,

623
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:07,280
first thing I do when I get home, bras off. Well, and you don't want your connect. Take

624
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,480
a picture as you're jumping up and down and some of the jumblies going jumble, jumble,

625
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,580
jumble. Uh, look, look, look, I, I swear I didn't even look at you. I hear Jessica Harper's

626
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,360
in our chat tonight. Hell, I'd play braless. Well, I call it, did I call it or did I call

627
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,640
it? Thank you very much. I did after Loki was setting up the connectors I went in and

628
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,240
put on a sports bra because I didn't want to kill myself. Thank you. Jessica's backing

629
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,280
me up here. My house is a bra free zone. 100%. There you go. Uh, kitsune says, I don't want

630
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,320
people to see me in my undies, so I got to make sure I wear pants. That's, that's the

631
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:49,240
same completely irrational fear that I have. Like with this technology, the way it is like,

632
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,040
I need something in the intro to the game to assure me, hi Rob, I promise I won't take

633
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,720
pictures of you with no pants on. Then we'll be fine. Like as long as the connect and I

634
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,080
have that mutual understanding that we're not taking pictures, I'll be fine. Rob, but

635
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,480
we could have pencils rage. Rob. Now remember now, here's something to be afraid of, I guess.

636
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,360
Well, in fact, actually, I guess it doesn't really shine too much of a spot. Remember

637
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,440
those, uh, I think there were Sony cameras actually that had an infrared filter mode

638
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,000
or something like that, and people were using them to see through people's clothes. It might

639
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,440
not matter with the connect camera. They will, it will be undressing you with its lenses.

640
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,400
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, to be fair, connect share.com only shows your own photos or videos

641
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,360
that you upload from the game. You can't find anyone else's stuff. I, I, I just don't trust.

642
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,920
There's hackers out there, Bobby. They're hacking everyone on out here. You know, your

643
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,440
pants hide your bras. I want though with the connect, the fact that it shoots, you know,

644
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,960
infrared lights, you know, in a really neat, uh, you know, pattern across the room. I want

645
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,480
a laser light show. Damn it. Because it's already doing that. I want it so that I can

646
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
see it. Yes. The Michael Jackson game that's coming out should do a Michael Jackson laser

647
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,000
shows. Like the one I saw in Seattle last year. Um, am I the only one that feels like

648
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,280
I should not look directly into the connect? Cause there's that little red light that looks

649
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,280
like a laser, which I'm sure is the infrared. It is a laser. Oh my God. Have you ever caught

650
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,040
yourself staring right into it going, this isn't a good idea. Yes. Because it's like

651
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,000
the mind control device. It's like, wait a second. I recognize that red in your eye.

652
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,680
Your terminator sent back from the future to kill me. Oh, look what I started in chat

653
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,560
chat that orange on show.com satellite minded the climate in your windows. They're snatching

654
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:46,500
your pictures up. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Anyhow, moving on. Oh yes.

655
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,880
Other things I played this week. Let's see. I also played rock band three. You know, I

656
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,960
loves me some keyboards. My least favorite thing about rock band three is that there's

657
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,160
not enough songs to play with the keyboards because I have like 300 songs in my library

658
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,680
now, thanks to rock band one, rock band two, all the download stuff, which is a really

659
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,320
obscene amount. I really hope they go back soon and add the key support. Yes, I know

660
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,200
it's supposed to be coming, so I'll stop bitching, but that's the only thing that bugs me about

661
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,840
it. Otherwise, I think it's a fantastic upgrade. Uh, and if you own rock band two or rock band

662
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,960
one, drop the extra money, drop the 50, 60 bucks and get this. The whole dropping in

663
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,280
and out will be great for parties. I think the song select mode and being able to filter

664
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,120
stuff is so much more intuitive. I think they really have learned. They have just created

665
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,400
an incredible music game and it really makes me go the hell are we going to get in rock

666
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,080
band four and the sorting is already blowing my mind. Oh, the sorting is outstanding. Outstanding.

667
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,840
Um, real quick, just because it does kind of tie into the whole connect thing. What

668
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:46,940
do you think of the new dashboard? Um, it's not that different from the old one, although

669
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:52,920
how much have they tried to kind of emulate the Wii and right on down to the whole little

670
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:04,640
like little like background noises that you hear when you're in the, you know, kind of

671
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,480
what it sounds like when you're in the menus and just and all the cuteness and the, the,

672
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,360
it, it, how I don't like how white it has been inspired from a Nintendo. You got a problem

673
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,160
with white things? Yes, I do. Oh, sorry to hear that. Well, I don't know what to tell

674
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:30,320
you. I got nothing. All right. Uh, Black Wolf says they are adding Bon Jovi keyboard support

675
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,640
this week, so they're going through the back catalog. Yeah, I know. I know. And I'm just

676
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,800
impatient. So what if I have 63 songs to play right now? It's not enough. Plus some of the

677
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,720
keyboard parts are really dopey. Like, um, is it everybody wants to know that one? It's

678
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,440
the other one. Um, Oh, one of those songs that always get the bands mixed up. Tears

679
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,720
for fears is everyone wants to rule the world, right? In excess. Need you tonight is the

680
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,480
song has the dumbest keyboard part ever. It's just 27 notes even on expert. And it's just

681
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:11,620
do do do. And that's the keyboard part. Do do do. Wow. And so you're playing the wow

682
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:16,880
like 27 times in the song. It's ridiculous. Like you could beat it on expert and your

683
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:26,920
score will be like 4700 tops. This is funny. But anyhow, uh, yeah. Um, the game's fun and

684
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,280
the keyboard stuff will get better with the download packs and everything. You know, I'm

685
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,640
actually like tempted to go find like a $10 copy of Lego rock band just to import those

686
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,400
songs into my massive collection. I did. I bet you can find them really cheap use now

687
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:48,480
or not used with the code. Uh, new, new. Dude, they still make it, right? Yeah. I can probably

688
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,080
find it on Amazon or something. It's dropped in price too much. Uh, all right. I want to

689
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,720
talk about a game no one's talked about yet. No one get into gaming news. I know we've

690
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,700
been doing this for a very long time. There's been a lot of games this week. Uh, pinball

691
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:04,840
FX two came out on the Xbox live marketplace. It's free, which is awesome. And if you owned

692
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,800
pinball FX one, the game will go, Oh, Hey, since you were a loyal pinball FX one user,

693
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:16,000
I'm going to just import those tables right on into pinball FX two. Love it. Like, like

694
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,800
just a little thing like that just actually like made me go, that was like actually really

695
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,640
cool. Like they didn't really have to do that, but they did. And then, you know, you can

696
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,520
play demos of the other tables. Any download tables also come right in because I think

697
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,720
I downloaded a buccaneer. I either had paid a small amount and it was free for a time

698
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,880
or something. Oh yeah, it's fun. And that came right into, and just all the different

699
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,040
features that are in it now. Like you, supposedly it does stuff with the Xbox live vision camera,

700
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,960
which made me laugh. Cause uh, now that everything's pushing connect, it's kind of funny that the

701
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,640
vision camera's in there. I don't know if it uses either or I'm not interested in playing

702
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,120
pinball with a camera, but apparently it will take video of you when you're playing. I should

703
00:42:53,120 --> 00:43:01,840
try selling back my vision camera to like $5. All right. Um, but yeah, I was, I was

704
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,720
just very happy that all the tables re-imported and they have a more robust demo system and

705
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,640
yeah, just, just, you can sense that the physics have been upgraded and the interface has been

706
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,400
upgraded and everything has gotten a little tweaked. Just, we've been talking about rock

707
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,100
band, right? Same type of thing. Like it's pinball FX is now like the rock band of pinball

708
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:25,360
and I am okay with that. I would be even better with that if them and uh, Midway and Williams

709
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,840
and all that, even though I know they're long gone, but like the people who are doing those

710
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:33,020
pinball collections could somehow like sleep together and bring some of those really classic

711
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:40,400
pinball tables into the pinball FX engine. That would be awesome. Also, I look at a game

712
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,840
like this and I go with game room being in the state that it's in right now, like I want

713
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,200
Zen studios to get game room. Like I want Microsoft to give that to Zen studios cause

714
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,280
they seem to know how to do this whole micro transaction game within a game thing. Like

715
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,320
I don't know what Microsoft has planned for game room long term. Now, if anything, they

716
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,380
might just sweep it under the rug. Like they've been doing a lot of stuff, but if they plan

717
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,060
on keeping that going, I would love to see it go over there. Even though I think that

718
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:12,960
studio probably has no interest in anything but pinball, but you never know. Huh? So that's

719
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,800
really it. Uh, that was it for my gaming week. I don't really have anything else to say on

720
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,120
that. So let's get into housekeeping tonight. Join our Facebook, facebook.com slash orange

721
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,160
launch radio. We're also on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R. I think we have a MySpace, but

722
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,320
who is MySpace anymore? Is anyone on MySpace? Any MySpace fans? Didn't think so. Let's get

723
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,920
into some gaming news. We'll start off tonight with Loki. We're only what, 50 minutes into

724
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,840
the show, finally getting to gaming news? I'm totally on MySpace. Just kidding. I'm

725
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,280
not on MySpace cause no one uses it. Uh, I think anyone who's on MySpace just never deleted

726
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,160
their profile two years ago. Exactly. No, um, actually some pretty interesting stuff

727
00:44:53,160 --> 00:45:02,600
going on. Um, Gran Turismo 5. Yeah. It's supposed to be out this week, right? Right? No? Yes?

728
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:09,400
Um, it didn't end up coming out this week and it's been delayed again. And um, of course

729
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,400
they haven't really said when it's supposed to be coming out. Um, other than just a few

730
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,080
different comments based off of um, the producers of the game and what retailers are saying.

731
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:29,080
Uh, for example, the uh, creator, uh, Yamaguchi, or was it, uh, Yamauchi, basically was telling

732
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:36,080
uh, the website uh, um, Japolik, uh, that the discs were being stamped as we speak.

733
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,360
Which I can tell you right now is bullshit. That the game has not been, um, or has not

734
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:48,480
gone gold and I don't believe is being stamped right now. Um, also apparently retailers are

735
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:55,920
listing that the game is going to have a, uh, past Christmas release date. Um, some

736
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,240
of them are showing, you know, a 1-1 release date or December 31st. Which I can tell you

737
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,940
right now is just a temporary date. Um, the official word on what's going on with this

738
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:11,920
is actually, uh, they are shooting for a release before November, but they're not sure if they're

739
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,760
going to hit that mark. If not, it's going to be sometime early December. That's when

740
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,120
you can expect Gran Turismo 5 unless they screw something else up. Which case it will

741
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:26,640
probably be next year. So, that's what's going on with that. You just gotta wait longer.

742
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:32,360
The more this is going on, the more I'm kinda like forgetting about this game. Exactly.

743
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,200
You know what I mean? That's kinda sad because Gran Turismo's like a huge franchise and everything.

744
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,000
But the more this is going on, I'm just kinda like, oh, there's all this other stuff. Remember

745
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,640
when Gran Turismo 5 Prologue came out and it was supposed to be a taste of what the

746
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,760
game was like? And now it's not even close to what the game was like? That's funny. Remember

747
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:55,160
when they had, was it, Gran Turismo 5, like, what was it, it was like Concept or something

748
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:02,360
like that? It was the free download that was on, um, the Playstation Network. It was ridiculous.

749
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:07,600
Satellite Minded says in our chatroom at chat.artisanotraday.com, do Grand Theft, or, sorry, I was gonna say

750
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:13,560
Grand Theft. Gran Turismo 5 delays count as news anymore. I think in this case, yes, because

751
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:19,560
they're missing the holiday season, if this is all true, which is, you know, pretty damaging.

752
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,680
I mean, it is and it isn't. I think we've shown through this last year that games can

753
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,360
do very well, even if released after the holidays. Case in point, Mass Effect 2 came out, what,

754
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:35,280
like a week after the holidays. And it did fine. But still, to miss that holiday season

755
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,440
especially with such an epic, epic game, I think is newsworthy. When it's been one that

756
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,840
Sony's been hedging a lot of bets on. But maybe it's just me. Spazinator says, Gran

757
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,480
Turismo 5 is the new Duke Nukem forever. That would be sad. And that's funny, is that it's

758
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,000
actually supposed to be coming out relatively soon. Like, isn't it coming out like first

759
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,680
quarter next year soon? Yes. Wow. I know. I know. Blowing my mind. I may have to take

760
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,400
a day off work for that one. Really? That big a deal. I don't even think I'm taking

761
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:14,560
a day off for Cataclysm. All right. Anyhow, going to other Sony news. Did you know that

762
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,360
the Tester 2 started this week? Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. Yeah, that's right. I did and

763
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:25,660
don't care. The Tester 2, of course, you know, this is the sequel to the Tester 1, which

764
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:31,220
is Sony's original programming for PlayStation Network. And, you know, it's been getting

765
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,080
its share of crap. And, you know, even though I, even I myself am hazing the Tester 2 here

766
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,480
on the show, it's not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. It's just no better than

767
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:48,480
like an average bravo reality television show. But is that as far as Sony wants to go? Possibly

768
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,480
not if you were to believe PlayStation Network director Susan Fennico. They want to go all

769
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,000
the way. That's right. She wants to go all the way. Saying, quote, I hope five years

770
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:06,120
from now we'll be winning Emmys for quality shows. No. I'm sorry. No one wins Emmys for

771
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,720
reality shows. It starts with a dream. It starts with a dream, Loki. I look at what

772
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,820
HBO has done over several years, this being a quote, where they started just offering

773
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,720
movies and went into the original production business. By no means am I putting the Tester

774
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,240
with the Sopranos and what have you, but if you want to make yourself the go-to destination

775
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:30,240
for content, you need to provide content that people can't get anywhere else. We look at

776
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,760
original programming and the Tester as the foundation for building out something much

777
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,720
bigger. I will give them props to the fact that they are, you know, also a movie production

778
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:48,640
house. So they have the, you know, the resources. I just don't see the Tester as a good example

779
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,980
of what can be done with those resources. It all starts with a dream. I mean, because

780
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,160
honestly with the Tester, I mean, granted, if we knew a lot of, you know, big companies

781
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:05,400
that we could do wonderful little stunt events with, you know, and stuff, like the first

782
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,100
person driving or, you know, third person driving or whatever, you know, we could probably

783
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:17,000
pull something off like that on our own with no budget whatsoever. They should totally,

784
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,120
like, they should let- Oh wait, no, I'm sorry. That's, I'm thinking of a different game.

785
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,480
I'm actually thinking of the world's championship gaming show that's actually on there. No,

786
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,680
I haven't seen the Tester at all, actually, so I don't know what they do. But I'm sure

787
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,600
it's, you know, not high budget. They should let the PlayStation Network become the public

788
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,360
access of the gaming community and people should be able to put their own shows up on

789
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,600
there. Oh, like the new podcast. That would be awesome. That would be awesome. Spassinator

790
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,920
PSN in our chat room says, there's only one good thing about the Tester 2, Adrienne Curry.

791
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,680
Need I say more? Really? She's in that? She is a hot mess. Like, that might make it actually

792
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,200
worth watching. That bitch is a mess. Oh, they don't have house parks this year or something?

793
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,680
They have her instead? I think so. Interesting. Because that, oh man, she is, let's just say

794
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:05,280
she was very pro Prop 19. She was very sad, I'm sure. That didn't pass. Just saying. Satellite

795
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,440
Minded says, Sony will win an Emmy for PSN shows when GT5 comes out. Yeah, because I'm

796
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,320
sure now she won't be able to do pot. Yeah, that was the only thing stopping her. Oh yes,

797
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:21,920
ah, that no vote really stopped everyone. I'm sure California. Way to go. Anyhow, uh,

798
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,760
you know, you're right though, that Sony has the studio behind it to make this work if

799
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:33,400
they want to. It's just that this, I don't really see as the real motivator to get things

800
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,440
going, but you know, we'll see what happens. What Sony should do is take some of the pilots

801
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:45,480
that maybe don't work out very well or better yet, here's a great idea, Sony. Take shows

802
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,400
that get canceled before their prime. And if you want an example of this, just go to

803
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,080
Fox because Fox always loves to cancel things before their prime and get the rest of the

804
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:01,600
episodes and put them up on PSN. Especially like, can you imagine if something like PlayStation

805
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,120
store had been around when Firefly was on TV? Like hear me out. Like I know there's

806
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:12,520
Whedon nerds that listen to the show. So imagine like Fox cancels Firefly, but Sony is smart

807
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:17,160
enough to know, Oh, there was actually this really strong cult audience for the show.

808
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,160
Somebody's already paid to make this show. Let's just buy the rights to put them on PlayStation

809
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,860
network and have it be ad supported. And then that would just draw, you know, and then maybe

810
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:29,800
it finally finds its audience in this on demand network. Like that could be huge. Now I don't

811
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,680
think Firefly was a Sony studio show. I think, I don't know. Yeah, but, but anyway, take,

812
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:41,120
just take that idea and apply it to maybe a really good show that Sony might've had

813
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,520
or here's an idea since you've got, you know, you like doing television programming and

814
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,160
stuff like that. Make your own IPTV channels, you know, actually have some different channels

815
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,520
of content on there that are exclusive to the PlayStation network and say maybe you

816
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:02,600
have to pay a $5 a month fee to access this stuff. That would be kind of neat. Yeah. Oh,

817
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:08,920
so Hulu. No, not necessarily. That's an on demand type thing. I'm talking about actual

818
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,800
content that's, you know, like a live network where you can tune in at a certain time and

819
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:19,200
watch something not, you know, Oh, Hey, I want to watch old episodes of this and go.

820
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:25,360
All right. Well, we'll see what happens with Sony programming later on. Maybe they'll announce

821
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:32,040
an expansion at E3. Who knows? Uh, but I would expect that Xbox is going to announce a, um,

822
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,440
success for success for the one versus 100 first. Oh wait, they did. And I don't think

823
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,360
it came up anywhere on our show world tonight. Did you hear about this just quickly? I got

824
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,600
to throw this out there. There's a new game coming out for Xbox that is that whole one

825
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,980
versus 100 esque type of thing. The massively multiplayer game. Uh, it's a poker game, which

826
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:56,960
I'm kind of like sick of poker games. Yeah. Dan plays Texas. Too many of them. Does he

827
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,240
really? Yeah. I mean, there's an audience for it. It's an easy game to learn. It'll

828
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,720
have an audience. I'll try it once, but not interested unless it's strip poker. And even

829
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,560
then I probably wouldn't be connected. That's possible. Connect poker. Now you can connect

830
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:19,280
in a whole new way. Dark soccer. What do you have for us? Well, we have, uh, something

831
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,360
regarding Apple. They have, uh, filed a patent that looks like it's going to be an augmented

832
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:33,840
reality game. It has, uh, something on there for targeting and using a real world interactive

833
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,140
game environment. And yeah, from what it looks like on here, it's going to be so you can

834
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:49,120
shoot people. In the face. Yeah. It even, um, has a mention of a gun attachment for

835
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:56,260
it. Um, I really don't know what they're doing. I mean, it could be maybe laser tag or could

836
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:01,320
be that they're just filing it so that no one else does it. Or it could be, you know,

837
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:06,720
a money shot game. Sorry, I just can't help but think of that thing we played on the show

838
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,240
a couple of weeks ago from the onion. That was the shoot people in the face over and

839
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:18,360
over game. And then it was like cute furry animals too. Yeah. Yeah. This will be controversial

840
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:24,080
at all. If you can shoot your friends in the face, maybe it can be like ink blaster. Right,

841
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:31,840
right. Red ink. Yeah. Red ink. Um, they could also just be patenting this so no one else

842
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:40,120
can. That's what my thought was. Yeah. Anyhow, that's all I got to say on that. Um, so other

843
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,640
interesting things. Apparently with the new dashboard, and this is, you know, totally

844
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:51,320
not unexpected. Um, they are actually going to be implementing new features to try to

845
00:55:51,320 --> 00:56:01,480
stop piracy. Um, unhackable. Yeah, about that. Let me guess, some mucky muck up there came

846
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,640
out and said that you can't pirate on this thing. It's, we have, we have made this hackproof.

847
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:13,240
I don't think anyone said anything about it, but basically they have, um, a new, uh, series

848
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:19,280
of checks that they do for disks, uh, which I guess hackers are referring to as AP 2.5.

849
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,880
I guess that work in conjunction with security sectors embedded in the disk. If the checks

850
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,780
come back negative, the player receives a dirty disk error and his or her console is

851
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:35,520
flagged for perma ban. Um, it says, uh, pirates though can hypothetically avoid these checks

852
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,880
by not updating to the new firmware. And though this will prevent them from playing on Xbox

853
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:47,980
live, which kind of defeats the purpose of avoiding the perma ban. Um, yes, apparently

854
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:53,440
if you know, well one, if you're burning a copy of the game anyways, you could just delete

855
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,160
the update on it. So that would, uh, you know, bypass that cause not all games that have

856
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:07,120
the new, uh, firmware attached with them actually require that firmware to run. Um, and also

857
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:12,360
if you have a J tag console, you can just play and delete the update anyways. And, um,

858
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,680
that way you can avoid actually, you know, having to update your system. Of course, well,

859
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,040
if you have a J tag, you can't update it anyways. Well look, Microsoft has a right to protect

860
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,960
their assets and I get that and everything, but are they bragging about it? Did they come

861
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:31,280
out and say? No. Digital Foundry did. Well then, you know, it's to be expected in this

862
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,520
case. I just, the only thing that gets me is when they come out and say, oh, well this

863
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,440
system, we've put measures in this to make this unhackable and it's going to do this

864
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,480
and this. That's just an open invitation for people to say, please hack me. But you know,

865
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,380
if Microsoft just quietly did this, that's how it should be done really. Well, here's

866
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:55,760
the thing too though. Um, it's not foolproof though, because apparently old Samsung and

867
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,280
Hitachi drives do not have that security check in their hardware. So it completely bypasses

868
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,040
it. So you know what people can do? They can spoof their drive with one of these older

869
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:11,040
drives, and then they can get past all those checks. And replacement drives are only about

870
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,480
20 bucks. Yeah, but that's a lot of work. And that's not a lot of work for someone that's

871
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,040
really determined. Well, yeah, but how many people are that determined? I don't know.

872
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,880
I've spoofed a drive before because I've messed up flashing a firmware on there. It's really

873
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:32,880
simple to do. Um, but yeah, I mean, you'd really have to want to play burn games. Interesting.

874
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,640
Well, you know, I'm sure we're going to continue to hear news like this as more of these firmware

875
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,080
updates come out. It's really no surprise that half the time new firmware updates. It's

876
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,680
always a back and forth. They'll win. They'll figure out a way around it and they'll come

877
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,720
out with something new, and they'll figure out a way around that, and so on and so forth.

878
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,240
Alright, well let's move on to something a little different, and this has to do with

879
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:59,080
the iPhone slash iTouch slash iPad, the iOS family of games. There's a brand new service

880
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:05,440
from Capcom out there. It's a free-to-play iPhone arcade app. It's called Capcom Arcade.

881
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,840
It is free, and you can play Street Fighter II, Commando, Ghouls and Ghosts in 1942. Ooh,

882
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:16,200
ah, but here's the catch. It's just like Game Room in the sense where you can get tokens

883
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:22,860
to play games for 99 cents, or you can pay three bucks for unlimited access. Or, here's

884
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:28,960
the best part, you get three free plays per day. So if you just want to download and play

885
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,840
three times a day, free! Yay! Go get it. What's the sobby from just changing data on your

886
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:42,120
phone? I have no idea. I'm not that desperate to play more Street Fighter II. I mean, I

887
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:47,160
played that game until my fingers were bleeding back when I was like 12. You know, I'll play

888
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:53,200
it once and I'll go, hee hee, this sure controls, like, ass on my iPhone, but it was fun to

889
00:59:53,200 --> 01:00:01,940
try. That's really what it's gonna be. Let's not forget, they make terrible controllers.

890
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:05,840
That's the one thing that's really stopping iOS from moving on is the lack of something

891
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:11,780
tangible right now. Exactly. But hey, I'm all about free, even if it's just three times

892
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:17,480
a day. I'll get as much of that out as I can. But where's Quiz and Dragons? That's what

893
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:24,880
I'm waiting for. Hey, you gotta, you know, keep room for updates. Mm-hmm. Alright, moving

894
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,880
on, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? We have release dates coming up right after

895
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,640
this, and classic game of the week, not that far away. Well this sounds really cool, and

896
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:38,720
something I'm actually thinking about participating in is that Capcom's forum has these contest

897
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:44,760
rules. Basically until November 22nd, you can do your own artwork for Marvel vs. Capcom

898
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:51,640
3, and if it basically wins, then you get an Xbox 360, and a couple of Marvel vs. Capcom

899
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:59,820
3, and a framed print of your own work. Make sure it's not dirty. And your work gets to

900
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:06,600
actually be in the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 art book. That's pretty cool. I mean, I don't

901
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:13,080
think that my stuff is all that fantastic, but it'd still be fun to participate. I guess

902
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:19,480
if you have artistic talent, which won't be me. When they do the voice actor thing, then

903
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,080
I'll try, but for now. I'd see, I'd just probably end up drawing a picture of Deadpool in his

904
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:28,600
boxers eating Cheetos, or something. What kind of sick fetish are you into over there?

905
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,280
Because that's usually how you see them in the comic book. I see. She has a boxer Cheeto

906
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:37,680
fetish. That's what it is. Well good luck Dark Soccer if you choose to participate.

907
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,360
If not, you're lazy. Alright, let's move on to some release dates. Travel the world and

908
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:49,660
see what's coming out in a country near you. Yes, this week has a few releases coming out.

909
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:55,320
Some games I'm sure you've heard about coming out this week, including one. Some modern

910
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:01,280
warfare and military game called Call of Duty Black Ops will be coming out on a few systems.

911
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,400
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. There's a version for the Wii, but really isn't going

912
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:17,520
to play it. And DS. Yeah, I'm sure DS sells a lot of Call of Duty Black Ops. Other fun

913
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:28,920
things coming out this week of course. I know there's more Kinect games. Oh yay, more? Yes,

914
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:40,200
more. No, actually, let's see here. God, I hate the new site that they have here. Well,

915
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:45,840
you know you could always prep these things in advance. Of course not. Just saying. Let's

916
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,240
see, let's talk about other things that are not necessarily Kinect games, because there's

917
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:56,200
a lot of those too. We gotta mention all of them, because everybody wants to know. Chuck

918
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:02,160
E. Cheese's Playhouse, a crappy game for kids, and that's on Nintendo DS. Noah's Ark, also

919
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,960
on the Nintendo DS. Chuck E. Cheese's Game Room on Nintendo DS. Nickelodeon Fit on the

920
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,880
Wii, that's really for little kids. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, that's right, the

921
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,080
one that's Claymation that they have each year, they base the game off that. That's

922
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:23,440
on the Wii and DS. Family Feud, decades coming out on the Nintendo Wii. What the hell is

923
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:29,320
Family Feud Decades? Is that like where you get Richard Dawson from the 70s? No, no, no.

924
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,800
Ray Combs from the 80s? It's much simpler than that. You have families dressed up like

925
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:39,520
different cliches of decades. That is the cheapest cash-in I have ever heard in my life.

926
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:48,840
Cha-ching. Monster Jam Path of Destruction on the Wii, DS, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and

927
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,240
they actually do have bundles that include a steering wheel, even one for the Playstation

928
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:58,440
3, but not for the move. You'd be surprised to find out it's actually for the stupid DualShock

929
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:06,240
3, because I guess the game uses 6-axis steering. Just Dance Kids, this is also another game

930
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,560
for little kids. It's Just Dance with the wheels on the bus go round and round and other

931
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:17,760
things like music from The Wiggles and whatnot. Definitely not something that our age demographic

932
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:23,480
listeners would be interested in. Also, Karaoke Revolution Glee, they have a bundle coming

933
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:32,800
out on the Wii. This game gives me nightmares. Let's see here. Honda Fever, it's basically

934
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:39,560
just a repackage of another game that came out that sucked. Beyblade Metal Fusion, I

935
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,120
guess this is actually a series that's still on TV, but they have that game coming out

936
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:50,200
on the Nintendo DS and the Wii. Oh, and I guess Monster Jam Path of Destruction came

937
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:56,520
out on PSP as well. This has got to be the worst game I've ever seen. Reload Target Down

938
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:02,880
for the Nintendo Wii. It is a game where you test fire guns. That's right, it's a game.

939
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,800
You don't shoot people, you target shoot with guns. Well, that way it's safe for the whole

940
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,720
trashy family. Oh yeah, I'm sure. It's still rated team. Because it's guns! It's not even

941
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,120
worth it, just by Call of Duty. I mean, seriously. Style Lab Fashion Design on the Nintendo DS.

942
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,200
Hasbro Family Game Night, they're doing some bundles for that. One and two are bundled

943
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:28,720
together on the Wii. Challenge Me Brain Puzzles 2 on the Nintendo DS. Remington Super Slam

944
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:37,400
Hunting North America on the Wii. Okay, let's see here. Remington Super Slam Hunting Africa

945
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:44,760
on the Wii. My Sims Collection with both My Sims Racing and I believe just My Sims. Tom

946
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:52,000
Clancy's Hawks 2 on the Wii, finally coming out now. Rune Factory 3 of a fantasy Harvest

947
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,560
Moon on the Nintendo DS. Apparently they're doing an ESA game pack. This is something

948
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:03,680
that they do every year. Usually a certain game manufacturer will actually put out a

949
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:12,080
collection of stuff. This one comes with Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, Tomb Raider, and Mercenaries

950
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:19,840
2 for $29.99 and all the proceeds I believe go to charity for that to the ESA if you want

951
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:27,120
to support that. Some really old ass games. Sing Star Dance, a very terrible add-on to

952
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:33,920
the Sing Star series. That is on the Playstation 3. The fight lights out. Seriously, do not

953
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,160
buy this game. It was terrible. It's got horrible reviews. You really do not need this game.

954
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:44,460
The Sly Collection, that's coming out on Playstation 3. It's a recreation of, or I guess, HD versions

955
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:51,920
of the old Sly Cooper games, and the third one is actually in 3D as well. Ah, yes. Man,

956
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:58,360
there's a ton of crap coming out. Digging for Dinosaurs on Nintendo DS. Zuzu Pets has

957
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:04,080
some more games coming out. The Kung Zu on Nintendo DS. I'm just gonna skip past a bunch

958
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:10,600
of this crap. I guess Harvest Moon is being re-released on Nintendo DS. Really? Well,

959
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:16,520
same with, they're doing a lot of re-releases on stuff. Rune Factory 2 is coming out. They're

960
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:20,680
re-releasing that. I think there's probably a price drop. Same with the first one. Re-releasing

961
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:26,360
all that stuff. The new Xbox controller with that wonderful fixed D-pad is now coming out

962
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:32,860
this week for $65 if you really want to buy that. And then a few things one week from

963
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:39,220
today. Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini Land Mayhem coming out on Nintendo DS. And then also one

964
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:46,200
week from today will be the potential for a new Mario Paint U-Draw tablet with U-Draw

965
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,740
Studios will be coming out. And then of course the two games that go along with that. Dude's

966
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:55,400
Big Adventure and Pictionary. And of course that's that tablet thing that looked like

967
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:01,040
the Mario Paint type pen tablet thing. And then of course Pictionary is also on Nintendo

968
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:07,000
DS. And that's it. Finally, jeez. Sorry, there's a lot of crap coming out of this one. And

969
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,560
I fenced this on crap. Let's go to Japan and see what's coming out over there. On the Xbox

970
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:16,400
360, Forza Motorsport 3 on November 11th. This is the ultimate edition by the way. Mushihima

971
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:22,640
Sama Futari version 1.5 is the Platinum Collection. Why do you want this so bad? This is a shooter

972
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,200
game, isn't it? It is. And it's a really cool shooter. And there's also an iPhone version

973
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:32,960
adventure game coming out. Also Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2, Mafia 2, and Scared 2 Fallen

974
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,160
Angel. Also getting a price reduction. Those are all on the Xbox 360 this week. What did

975
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:45,840
I say? Scared. Oh, my bad. Yeah, Sacred 2. I like a game called Scared 2. Scared 2. PlayStation

976
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:51,160
3 has Biohazard 5 alternative edition. That would be Resident Evil 5 with the move. Dragon

977
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:59,200
Ball Raging Blast 2, Mafia 2, Scared 2, Fallen Angel, my bad. Shinsengoku Musou Online, Soton

978
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:07,000
Rambo comes out this week as well on the PlayStation 3. This is the online version of, why can

979
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,880
I, name is slipping my head, the one where you kill everything and smash the button.

980
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,360
There's like 7 of those game, Dynasty Warriors, is that it? Yeah. It's that. Oh, what was

981
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:23,240
the one? Oh, Dynasty Warriors Online. Yeah, it's that. Moving on to other systems on the

982
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:29,960
Nintendo Wii in Japan this week on the 11th. The 25th anniversary Mario game comes out

983
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,600
over there as well as see Nintendo Wii in some different colors. Something called the

984
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,000
Party Game Box 100, use your imagination. Wii Remote Plus controls in all sorts of different

985
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,680
colors. Black, blue, pink, red, white, Wii. Puyo Puyo 7 gets a price reduction. No one

986
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:50,640
cur. Jinsei Game, Happy Family gets released as well. Speaking of things that we don't

987
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:57,120
care about. Uh, PlayStation 2 gets one game this week called Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica

988
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,920
After School. I can only guess what this game is gonna be about. I'll give you a hint, there's

989
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:07,560
a girl in a school outfit on the cover. Porn? No, sadly it's not that, but it's probably

990
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,880
just another, like, you know, we're angsty, we're in school, da da da. Nintendo DS, Crafting

991
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:17,360
Mama comes out this week. Puyo Puyo 7 gets a price reduction there as well. Tamagotchi!

992
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:23,360
Bet you thought those games were dead, yep. Tamagotchi no Narikiri Challenge comes out

993
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:29,920
as well. That's on the Nintendo DS this week. And lastly going to the Sony PSP, God of War

994
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:35,480
Goes to Sparta gets its Japanese release this week. Tactics Ogre, Unmei no Wa gets a release

995
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:41,720
this week. I know that'll be a game that has some people excited. And, uh, Karu Batake

996
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:47,480
de Sukamete Portable comes out this week. I originally had read that as Karu Bekake,

997
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:55,120
but it actually is not that, although it looks like this game stars plenty of... Bekake?

998
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:59,200
People that you'd probably want to see in a bukake porn. I'm just kidding, they're kids,

999
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,640
that's gross. Alright. What's wrong with you? How about something else? What's wrong with

1000
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:09,520
you? How about it? Well in the UK we have on the 9th Call of Duty Black Ops, then we

1001
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:17,240
have on the 10th Dance Central, Dance Paradise, Dance Evolution, Dance Masters, Fighters Uncaged,

1002
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:23,160
Game Party in Motion, the Kinect, Kinect Adventures, Kinect Joyride, Kinect Sports, Kinectimals,

1003
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:30,280
Motion Sports, Kinect Adventures, Your Shape Fitness Evolved, and also Raving Ravage, Travel

1004
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:40,040
in Time, and Sonic Colors, Tom Clancy's Hawks 2. That's it. That's all I'm gonna say anyway.

1005
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:44,360
See I like how you filter the crap out. Well just cause I go to a... I'm sorry I don't

1006
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:50,280
understand what you're talking about. I'm just messing with you. Alright, uh, let's

1007
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,140
move on. A couple more stories in the Classic Game of the Week. You want me to filter all

1008
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:59,920
the crap out? I'll just mention one game the next time. Stop. Sorry, this week only comes

1009
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:05,480
out. We're gonna filter all the crap. It is Chuck E. Cheese as the only game coming this

1010
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:13,120
week. Now, Xbox Live Indie Games has disappeared off the main marketplace menu and you actually

1011
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:18,120
have to dig for it now. It's in Specialty Shops. By the way, it's not that hard to find

1012
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:24,000
you guys. I know. It is a couple menus deep, but it's not like impossible to find. But

1013
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,580
I understand why people are pissed. Sorry, I'll shut up. Yeah, so it is now under Specialty

1014
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:33,960
Shops. Of course, Avatar Marketplace being the first spot on there, but Indie Games is

1015
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:41,360
a close second. And, of course, Xbox Live Indie Game creators are bummed over the fact

1016
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:49,920
that the menu has been slightly hidden, you know, if you will. And, uh, I don't know.

1017
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:57,960
It's just, uh, they kind of feel like they've been brushed off, I guess. I don't think it's

1018
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:04,720
that big a deal, to be honest. You know, don't they still let you use web links to, like,

1019
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,840
link directly to items in the store? That's really how you're gonna have to start selling

1020
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,340
games, I think, is really kind of using the web as a presence. And click here to download

1021
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:17,600
to your Xbox now. It is kind of a shame, and I'm really surprised Microsoft hasn't gone

1022
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:23,640
here yet, that they haven't tried to make something like iTunes on your PC that would

1023
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:31,080
be automatically to download to your Xbox. Like, imagine a whole integration with Windows

1024
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,060
Media Center, since that's, you know, where Microsoft, you know, obviously they can't

1025
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:38,200
make iTunes, but they're kind of like competitors to Windows Media Player. Imagine if they had

1026
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,900
something like Windows Media Player with a store in it, where it wasn't just the music

1027
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:46,700
and movies, but things that you could download to your Xbox. Or maybe, like, when you download

1028
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:52,640
a movie, it would download to your PC and your Xbox. But, within that, they could do,

1029
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,700
like, this whole indie games thing, kind of like iTunes does. Like, I don't know, I could

1030
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:04,060
kind of see that being kind of neat. But, at the same time, maybe it's too much work.

1031
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,080
Maybe they're trying to sell this whole Kinect thing. And they haven't opened up Kinect to

1032
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:10,760
indie developers yet, have they? Probably won't for a long time.

1033
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:17,160
Um, I don't remember if they have or not. I think maybe Xbox Live Arcade, but not, um,

1034
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,880
I don't know.

1035
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,760
Ross Steel, UT is in our chat room. Is there really? Ross Steel, UT, I haven't seen him

1036
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,400
in, like, two years. The indie games aren't any less easy to find than they were before.

1037
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,760
They're just butthurt.

1038
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:34,760
Well, yeah, I mean, I didn't find them particularly hard to find. And I think, again, if you sell

1039
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,080
yourself on the web, you'll be fine. I can understand, though, where the developers are

1040
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,760
feeling a little bit unloved. But keep in mind, there's a lot of things at Microsoft

1041
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,440
right now being unloved. Game Room's another one. Everything's all about the Kinect.

1042
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:51,400
Kinect, Kinect, Kinect, Kinect. Maybe after the holidays, they can focus on that other

1043
01:14:51,400 --> 01:15:00,820
stuff again, but we'll see. Although I somehow, uh, wouldn't be holding my breath.

1044
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:05,640
Something you know is inevitable, though, and is going to happen, is a Bejeweled 3.

1045
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,920
That's right, Bejeweled 1 and Bejeweled 2 are some of the biggest freaking games ever

1046
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,560
made. Bejeweled 3 is coming out on December 7th.

1047
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,040
And my wife didn't care.

1048
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,040
What?

1049
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,040
She's like...

1050
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,040
I thought Bejeweled was the only game she plays.

1051
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,320
What were they going to add to it? I'm like, well, they have this, like, new poker mode

1052
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,880
thing. She's like, that's dumb.

1053
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:27,240
Well, wait until she tries. There are also, just so you know, new Quest and Zen modes

1054
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:32,400
are coming to the game, unlockable secret game variants, and there's also supposed to

1055
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:37,800
be smoother gameplay and new music and sound. Twenty dollars if you want to get it through

1056
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:43,520
PopCap.com, but I bet you'll have to wait not even six months and it'll be out on iPhone

1057
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:49,320
and Xbox Live and PlayStation Network and pretty much anything with a controller or

1058
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,320
touch screen.

1059
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,100
We'll have Bejeweled 3.

1060
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:57,120
If Bejeweled 3 isn't cutting it for you, there's plenty of other Bejeweled stuff to come, including

1061
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:02,200
Bejeweled Blitz Live. That's right, Bejeweled Blitz Live.

1062
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:07,260
It might be on the PC, but they're saying that the classification says it's an Xbox

1063
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:11,340
360 title. So who knows? Maybe it will show up on both.

1064
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:17,460
Maybe it's something where now you'll be able to intermix the Xbox with the Facebook game.

1065
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,880
Could be interesting.

1066
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,880
By the way, Zuma Blitz is supposed to be coming out very soon as well, too. I think that's

1067
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,720
in beta right now. So lots of new games coming out of Pop Crack.

1068
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,440
What about Plants vs. Zombie Blitz? I guess I shouldn't hold my breath on that one.

1069
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:40,560
Hey, it's the time of the show where we take a stroll down memory lane and allow Dark Sakura

1070
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,440
to take the reins for a little bit. Oh, we must be crazy.

1071
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:49,440
As she says, hey, this is a classic video game that you ungrateful children need to

1072
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:54,120
go back and show a little of. Forget these K'Nex with their fancy infrared lasers and

1073
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:58,200
the move with their flashing little ice cream cone light thingies.

1074
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,700
These are games you can play in your underwear.

1075
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:06,080
That's right. These are games you can play with no pants on and you'll like it.

1076
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1077
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:17,000
The classic game of the week is Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Superheroes.

1078
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,640
Because I got a big excited girl boner for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 today.

1079
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,920
A bit of Lady Wood? Yes.

1080
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,920
So we have to start off with the characters from the game.

1081
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,920
This is my favorite movie in the game, for the record.

1082
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:40,920
So, yes, the game is the fifth of the Marvel Comics licensed fighting games.

1083
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:49,200
This one, actually, instead of being just an X-Men vs. or Marvel Superheroes vs. Street

1084
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:55,200
Fighter, this goes all over the place. And you have to basically get all of these

1085
01:17:55,200 --> 01:18:01,200
people against Onslaught, who I felt was actually kind of a retarded character in the comics

1086
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:08,200
but that's just me. So, moving forward, we have this one is where

1087
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,240
you actually have a random assist character that you start off before the match instead

1088
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,920
of bringing one of your teammates in, which I think they've gotten rid of for Marvel vs.

1089
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,920
Capcom 3. And then, you know, there were also ways that

1090
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,520
you could select who your little bonus person was.

1091
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:32,520
And then, you also had duo team attacks. And this music is awesome, too.

1092
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:39,520
It's the theme of the Strider family. He's not in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so far, but

1093
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,240
this one. Yet.

1094
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,320
So far, I said so far. I thought he was.

1095
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,520
I was like, why not? But, no, not yet.

1096
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:56,520
So anyway, the different characters in this one is you had Spider-Man, Captain America,

1097
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,680
Hulk, Wolverine, Venom, Gambit, War Machine, Gold War Machine, Red Venom, Orange Hulk,

1098
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:09,680
and Onslaught on the Marvel side. And on Capcom, you had Ryu, Chun-Li, Zangief,

1099
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:17,080
Mega Man, Jin, Morrigan, Strider Hiryu, Captain Commando, Roll, you should play Roll's music

1100
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,880
now. Lilith, or Shadow Lady.

1101
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:27,880
I love Roll had singy-songy music. Yeah, she had singy music.

1102
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:42,840
As far as your special partners, you got Unknown Soldier, Luance, and Siva, Saki Omakane, Piran

1103
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:49,840
Fur, Psylocke, Michelle Hart, Iceman, Arthur, Tonpu, Juggernaut, Devilot, Thor, Magneto,

1104
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:56,840
US Agent, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Anita, Jubilee, Rogue, Shadow, and Sentinel.

1105
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,840
It at least gave the nods over to Tonpu. That was just cool. I laughed.

1106
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:08,840
At any rate, there is a perfect version that came out on Dreamcast in 1999, and it had

1107
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:14,840
cross fever modes so you could have four players play simultaneously. There was a version that

1108
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:19,840
came out on the Playstation, which was the EX edition in Japan, but it didn't have the

1109
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:26,840
tag team gameplay, and it didn't have the secondary characters, except just for assists.

1110
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:33,840
But it did have the crossover, you could play a tag team with identical teams, which was

1111
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:40,840
kind of stupid. But it did allow you to play as onslaught, and if you beat the game with

1112
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,840
Mega Man or something. And yeah, the soundtrack came out, which I've got the soundtrack, and

1113
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,840
it is amazing. And it was great, and it opened the door for all this other funness.

1114
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:03,840
Of course, Dan got me hooked on playing with Strider Neo. This is other good music.

1115
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:10,840
Everyone should recognize that.

1116
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:18,840
Yep, the theme of Mega Man. It was a lot of fun. It's a great game. Definitely one worth

1117
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:23,840
having on the Dreamcast, because it was perfect. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is really good. I'm looking

1118
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,840
forward to Marvel vs. Capcom 3, but I had to start it with somewhere, and I think this

1119
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,840
is a good place to do it.

1120
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,840
It's as good of a place as any.

1121
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,840
Yep, so that's it. That's your classic game of the week.

1122
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:41,840
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Marvel vs. Capcom 1. Back before

1123
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:48,840
there was all these other sequels, and now this new fancy one, although I gotta say,

1124
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:54,840
the videos I was looking at online for the new one, and even seeing it at E3, although

1125
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,840
it looks like it's come a long way, just even in the videos I've been seeing online.

1126
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,840
Pretty awesome, gotta say. Looking forward to it.

1127
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,840
Alright, we're gonna take a break. We'll be right back though, guys. Stay tuned. We have

1128
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,840
plenty more show to come. We got our rapid fire news, which there's a lot since we have

1129
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,840
to make up for last week. We're also gonna talk a little more about that whole Kinect

1130
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,840
hacking stuff. We have another story on that coming up in a minute. We're gonna talk about

1131
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:21,840
Fable 3 and Saints Row as well in the Xbox Live Arcade. So don't go anywhere, guys.

1132
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,840
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1133
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:31,840
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. We are taping the 388th episode of

1134
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:37,840
our show live on this November the 7th of 2010. We've been talking a little bit in

1135
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,840
Part A tonight about the new Kinect obviously is out, and we all had a chance to get our

1136
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,840
hands on it, which is weird because I still have yet to really play PlayStation Move

1137
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,840
outside of E3. But, Loki, you've gotten a chance to get your hands on both at this point

1138
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:55,840
now. What do you think both are gonna offer us in a year's time?

1139
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:00,840
The move, I think it's gonna pretty much be pretty much what you see right now with

1140
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,840
the Nintendo Wii. The only difference being that since you have the camera in there,

1141
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,840
they can do some of the augmented reality stuff, which is actually pretty cool with it.

1142
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:17,840
I don't think it's really that different. They have more of a setup now where they're

1143
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,840
gonna use it with more of their hardcore games, I guess, because Killzone 3 is already

1144
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,840
gonna have that. SOCOM 4, they've got support for it. So it'll be interesting to see

1145
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:31,840
how they implement that stuff or if it's even gonna be necessary or if you're gonna

1146
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,840
be able to play as well with it. And then, of course, the Kinect. It's hard to say

1147
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,840
how that's gonna really... I think there's a lot more potential with the Kinect because

1148
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,840
they can pretty much do whatever they want with no controller gaming, but then they

1149
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:51,840
can also, if they wanted to, and they've said it before, they're like, you know we

1150
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,840
can have this so that it works with you playing not using the controller, right?

1151
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:01,840
The complaint is, oh, there's no buttons and stuff. It's like, well, who says that

1152
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:08,840
I can't do that or put out another controller later or whatever. I think there's a lot

1153
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,840
more creative freedom with the Kinect than there is with the Move.

1154
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:21,840
What do you think this is going to do anyway about the possible Xbox 720, the PlayStation 4,

1155
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,840
the Wii 2, and obviously all these names are hypothetical.

1156
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,840
I don't know, but if you notice, and I'm not sure if this is necessarily because

1157
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,840
Microsoft is spending more money on advertising, because they are spending a lot of money

1158
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,840
on advertising, but have you noticed with the whole Kinect stuff, there's been a lot

1159
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:41,840
bigger of a splash with the Kinect stuff as far as all the talk shows and stuff like that.

1160
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,840
Oh, absolutely.

1161
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,840
Then there was the Move. The Move just came out and like...

1162
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,840
It's here, guys.

1163
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,840
It's here.

1164
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:50,840
They had commercials. That's mostly of what you've seen for the Move and targeted

1165
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,840
commercials during things like South Park. You'd always see a commercial for the Move.

1166
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,840
You know, things of that sort. But yeah, definitely the Kinect is definitely trying to go

1167
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:06,840
that Nintendo route of being on Ellen, being on the News, doing the whole Times Square

1168
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,840
thing that they did. Gonna be very interesting.

1169
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,840
Of course, Nintendo gets to go through this whole hub-a-loo again with the 3DS,

1170
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,840
because that's going to be another big thing that, you know, they'll parade that out on

1171
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,840
the Ellen show, too, and she'll go like, wow, it's like I could really see 3D, guys.

1172
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,840
You know, and that whole thing. Some corny joke. Ooh, let's dance. You know.

1173
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,840
Yeah.

1174
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,840
That'll be what happens. So...

1175
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,840
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

1176
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,840
ActDeaf says, I think the next Wii will be a Super Wii.

1177
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,840
Certainly a possibility. I mean, that might be a silly idea, but, you know, the Wii has

1178
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:46,840
that recognition, just like Nintendo had back in the day as a system.

1179
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,840
And then there was the Super NES. You know, that whole Wii HD everyone likes to theorize about it.

1180
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,840
And Frisbee follows that up with, and then the Wii 64.

1181
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,840
RasteelUT says, the Kinect is more novel than the Move. Let's be real.

1182
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:00,840
You agree?

1183
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,840
I think so. And the other thing, like I've said that...

1184
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,840
Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I think it's more something we haven't seen before.

1185
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:12,840
I mean, it is and it isn't. It feels like more of an evolution than the Move does.

1186
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:18,840
Although, the technology behind the Move sounds pretty cool compared to what we've seen on the Wii.

1187
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,840
We just don't see a lot of that in motion yet.

1188
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,840
But this whole augmented reality and all that stuff you talk about makes me very excited.

1189
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:25,840
The potential.

1190
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:35,840
And that's the other thing too. The augmented reality stuff is possible with, you know, the Kinect.

1191
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,840
I mean, who's to say? Because it can track your body.

1192
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:43,840
Who's to say you can't, I don't know, even just have a game come out and have something as simple as

1193
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,840
you hold up a piece of cardboard and there you go.

1194
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,840
I mean, it just has to have something like a target for it.

1195
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:56,840
And it basically uses the sensors that are in the Move controller and the orb to track that.

1196
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:01,840
So, there's potential they could do all the same stuff.

1197
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:07,840
And, you know, it has a good, you know, it can track you really well as we saw with, you know,

1198
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:13,840
Dance Masters where it can do a literal, almost like a green screen of myself while I'm playing the game.

1199
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,840
Not that I really want to see that because that's very, I feel like an idiot already.

1200
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:24,840
And looking at myself playing the game, it's just like, why are you doing this?

1201
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:29,840
Let me ask Jamie here for a minute. I don't mean to take you away from our lovely chatters.

1202
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,840
We have a chat room at chat.orangetotraday.com.

1203
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,840
But I know you don't get as into the new stuff, I think, as you have the classics.

1204
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,840
You definitely, the most room in your heart is for the classic games.

1205
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:45,840
What do you think about this new, I mean, certainly this is technology we never really saw before in the classic gaming world.

1206
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:52,840
What do you think about the Kinect and the Move and all this and its potential impact on gaming?

1207
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,840
I think the Move looks like a sex toy, so I'm completely not interested.

1208
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:06,840
The Kinect I like. I really do. I think that it combines everything that they were trying to do with the Move and with the iToy.

1209
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:14,840
Except it does it right. And it definitely gives you more of that virtual environment feel to your games.

1210
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:20,840
That, I think, is great. I think that I can see it going two ways.

1211
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:25,840
I can think we're going to get more and more and more like that and it'll be great. Or it will wear off after a while.

1212
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,840
The novelty will wear off and people want to sit back on their couches with their, you know, controllers in their hands.

1213
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:37,840
I like half agree with Dark Sakura. I kind of, the Kinect, there's some things about it that strike me as gimmicky too.

1214
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,840
I mean, and I think it's that we haven't really seen its full potential yet.

1215
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,840
Whereas at least Sony's kind of like throwing these things out there.

1216
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:50,840
Like, I don't write off the Move quite as fast, but I will say right now, there's nothing I really want on the Move.

1217
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,840
There's nothing the Move is doing for me and the type of games I like right now.

1218
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:00,840
Well, there's a lot of possibilities for things they can do. Remember the whole head tracking demo that we saw with the Wii?

1219
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:05,840
Where they have the guy wearing the Wii Remote? You can do that with the Kinect because it tracks your head.

1220
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,840
So they can do that kind of stuff for like first person cheers. That's what I was saying.

1221
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:15,840
That it's not necessarily, you don't have to have a game where you're just moving around like crazy.

1222
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,840
They can just have it where they track your head. You're doing all your movements and stuff on the controller.

1223
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:25,840
And you can still be slightly more immersed in the game and it can be an optional feature, which is kind of cool.

1224
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,840
You can bring the mocap games home.

1225
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,840
Yeah.

1226
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,840
I'm really interested to see what next year's E3 is going to be.

1227
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,840
Because at next year's E3, all of this is going to be the norm.

1228
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:41,840
The 3DS is going to be out by next E3. You know, and all the rumors about the March release date or what have you.

1229
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:42,840
It'll be March.

1230
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,840
It'll be out before June. That's a given.

1231
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,840
All of this stuff is now going to be the norm at next E3.

1232
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,840
Move is now out. Kinect is now out. 3DS is now out.

1233
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:57,840
And it's going to be really interesting because the next E3 is now going to be all about, okay, now what are you going to do with this?

1234
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,840
Now that it's out. What have you come up with in the past year for how to use this technology?

1235
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:07,840
It's going to be a very interesting show. I'm really excited about it. Even though it's like, what, nine months away?

1236
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,840
I want to go this year.

1237
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,840
Yeah. Hopefully we can make it all work for us.

1238
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,840
Alright.

1239
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:23,840
But, you know, I was just thinking, if you put both in front of me and said pick which one you want for free, I'd grab the Kinect.

1240
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:30,840
I think me too, but only because it goes back to the rule of the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1241
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:36,840
And I wouldn't write the move off yet because a year from now we might be looking at the opposite.

1242
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,840
Like, kind of like, that's just kind of what I see.

1243
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,840
Is that I'm not sure I really see where Kinect is going, but maybe I'll be proven wrong at the next E3.

1244
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:54,840
I think, if anything, if the whole point of releasing these new motion systems were to capture the new audience that they're looking for, the more casual audience,

1245
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,840
I think the Kinect has done a better job of that.

1246
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,840
Or at least it seems like it.

1247
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,840
I don't think a lot of people care.

1248
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,840
And that's too bad, because it's not a bad piece of hardware.

1249
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,840
It's just it's not too different than what's already being done with the Wii.

1250
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:16,840
It's just slightly better, and yeah, granted the hardware is better, so you can do better looking games, but it's not completely different.

1251
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:21,840
Whereas I would say the Kinect is completely different than what they're doing with the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

1252
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,840
It is separate.

1253
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:30,840
Well I think one thing to consider as far as new hardware goes, I don't think it came up anywhere else in our show roll, but something that's been coming up.

1254
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:37,840
This was a lot the week we were out, but were those rumors of the PSP phone, and some of the screenshots that showed up and all that.

1255
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,840
So if this new PSP evolution is going to be shown at E3, could be interesting.

1256
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:48,840
But I don't think it's going to be anything outside of this whole motion gaming stuff and what we're talking about here.

1257
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,840
But we'll see.

1258
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:55,840
Anyhow, let's move on into some rapid fire news and some of the quick stories we have for you now.

1259
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,840
We have a lot since we had a week off, so Loki, we're going to start with you for the quick news.

1260
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:00,840
Yes.

1261
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,840
Oh sorry, Twitter topics. Get them in quick. You have about two more minutes.

1262
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,840
Yes. So anyways, some interesting stuff going on.

1263
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:14,840
Of course, we were talking a little bit about Dance Central and Harmonix being the ones that like to support download content.

1264
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:18,840
They had some download content day one, whether you like that or not.

1265
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:25,840
New songs that are coming out for Dance Central are going to run you 299 or 240 Microsoft points each.

1266
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:35,840
The first three songs that they had available, Neo's Because of You, Lady Sovereign's I've Got You Dancing, and Sean Paul's Temperature.

1267
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:40,840
And I guess those are all available now, and hopefully we'll see some more download content next week.

1268
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:52,840
And let's see here. It didn't really say if the same moves are in there or if they're recycled or whatever, but I think it's kind of neat.

1269
01:32:52,840 --> 01:33:00,840
I really wish that the game had like a kind of a routine editor because they could easily do that with the flash cards and stuff they have on there.

1270
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,840
Can anyone say the sequel?

1271
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:04,840
Yeah.

1272
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:11,840
Of course, Black Friday is not too far away, and with Black Friday, of course, the ads will leak out.

1273
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:17,840
The first one to leak out with gaming related information, of course, would be from Sears.

1274
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:24,840
And they had some new bundles and stuff for the holidays and some new interesting colors for different things.

1275
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:31,840
For example, the limited edition red and green DSI bundles for $150, which include Mario Party DS.

1276
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:42,840
They've got a 160GB PlayStation 3 bundle for $300, which includes Uncharted 2 and a Blu-ray of the new movie Karate Kid.

1277
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,840
PSP...

1278
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,840
What a deal.

1279
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,840
The PSP 3000? Well, I think those two games are free.

1280
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,840
No, just the whole Karate Kid Blu-ray and...

1281
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,840
It's not a bad movie. I liked it.

1282
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,840
I just refuse to see it. I'm being stuck up for no reason.

1283
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,840
It was good, okay?

1284
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:09,840
The PSP 3000, a bundle for $130, which includes LittleBigPlanet and UMD of the Karate Kid.

1285
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:14,840
4GB Xbox 360 bundle for $200, which includes Halo Reach.

1286
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,840
That's not bad.

1287
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:21,840
They had $10 off of a standard, I guess, Wii bundle.

1288
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:30,840
Also, they're going to be doing discounts on different games like Medal of Honor, Fable 3, Halo Reach.

1289
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:35,840
All will be available for $40, which is pretty awesome.

1290
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,840
Actually, this is kind of cool.

1291
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:42,840
One of the games that's being marked down to $40, which will be just coming out around that time,

1292
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,840
Need for Speed Hot Pursuit.

1293
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:50,840
If you're interested in that game, which you should be because it's by Criterion and they do really awesome racing games,

1294
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,840
you should definitely check it out.

1295
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:59,840
I'm just saying, Loki, that of the Smith Kids, I think Willow is more talented because she whips her hair back and forth.

1296
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,840
I don't know. The movie was not bad. I liked it.

1297
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,840
Whatever you say. Isn't it the Kung Fu Kid?

1298
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,840
Yes, it is the Kung Fu Kid.

1299
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,840
Just saying.

1300
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:13,840
They think we're dumb, so whatever.

1301
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:21,840
Then, of course, with that, there's some new Xbox demos that came out on the marketplace this week.

1302
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,840
Rock Band 3, which is pretty awesome, so you can check out a few songs from that.

1303
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:33,840
Apache Air Assault, which is a helicopter attack game that's coming out on the 360 and PS3 in, I believe, next week or so.

1304
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:41,840
Then, the most retarded addition to that would be Joyride, which, if you have the Kinect,

1305
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:47,840
you'll realize that there is already a demo for Joyride on the disc of Kinect Adventures.

1306
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:54,840
Why you would need to download an additional demo is beyond me, but have at it, I guess.

1307
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:58,840
Definitely check out those demos if you haven't yet.

1308
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:05,840
Dance Central, Joyride, Your Shape Fitness, and I believe that was it on there.

1309
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:11,840
But, hey, three games you can check out for free, because I didn't notice that right away, and it said,

1310
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:16,840
Other Kinect games? What's that? I'm like, oh, there's demos on here! Awesome!

1311
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,840
Oh my gosh!

1312
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,840
So, yeah, check that out.

1313
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:30,840
And then, finally, I don't know, this is kind of ridiculous, but apparently with the Wii version of the Michael Jackson,

1314
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:38,840
the experience game, you're gonna get the jewel-studded white glove to play the game with,

1315
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,840
I guess, so that you can feel more like Michael Jackson.

1316
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:46,840
Is it possible to think something is lame and yet totally awesome at the same time?

1317
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:50,840
Like, this is totally awesomely lame.

1318
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:57,840
Like, it's so bad, it's good. It's bad, it's bad, it's really, really bad.

1319
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,840
You know it.

1320
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:07,840
Oh, what I would pay to see Loki modeling one of these Michael Jackson gloves.

1321
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,840
I may have to get the game when it comes out for the Kinect.

1322
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,840
You know, I gotta say, it actually looks kind of awesome.

1323
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:18,840
Like, let's face it, Michael Jackson had some badass songs, and you know there's gonna be good dances.

1324
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:23,840
It's just dance with Michael Jackson songs, and with optional karaoke.

1325
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,840
I don't give a shit about the optional karaoke, but I think that would be awesome.

1326
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,840
I fucking love Michael Jackson's stuff. I don't care what people say that he did or did not do.

1327
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,840
He was an awesome music artist.

1328
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,840
I'm with you. If you just ignore all the other stuff.

1329
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:43,840
And he has some new songs coming out apparently that there are rumors saying that they're so sound like doing some of them, but who gives a fuck?

1330
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,840
Okay, everything that's been going on with like Tupac and Biggie when they were, you know, gone before their time,

1331
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:52,840
and yet it seems like Tupac is still releasing a new album every other year from some shit they dig up,

1332
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:56,840
expect it to be even worse with Michael Jackson.

1333
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:05,840
Like, there will be a new album every year for as long as you're alive, and then there will soon be the rumors about he never really died.

1334
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:10,840
They faked the death, and the body that came out of the house wasn't really him, and all this stuff.

1335
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:16,840
And, you know, he did it to escape his personal problems, even though his kids were up there on stage crying.

1336
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:20,840
And two more songs apparently have been announced for the game.

1337
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:28,840
One of which is my wife's absolute favorite Michael Jackson song, one I kind of like, Speed Demon, and Dirty Diana.

1338
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,840
Her absolute favorite song.

1339
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,840
That's one of my favorites too.

1340
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:37,840
You know what? My favorite actually isn't one of his dancey ones.

1341
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,840
Uh, Man in the Mirror?

1342
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,840
Well, she's out of my life.

1343
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,840
Interesting.

1344
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:52,840
Anyhow, we need to have a whole Michael Jackson the game launch party, but I just don't think everyone else would be as into it.

1345
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,840
I just don't want to get in on the weed.

1346
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,840
I think the generation after us too, which makes up a lot of our listeners.

1347
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:01,840
They have terrible taste in music, okay?

1348
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:07,840
They weren't around when it was about Michael Jackson on MTV, you know what I mean?

1349
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,840
Like, we literally grew up with him, you know?

1350
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,840
It's just different.

1351
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:16,840
I remember when Thriller was on every hour.

1352
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,840
Well, he and my mom were the same age.

1353
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:19,840
Oh wow.

1354
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:27,840
So, you know, I went through all of, you know, her old stuff and, you know, I grew up with the whole thing.

1355
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:31,840
Alright, anyhow, let's move on and talk about other gaming news.

1356
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:35,840
You Don't Know Jack, oh god, I love this game and I'm so excited it's making a comeback.

1357
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,840
Because they did kind of burn that series into the ground.

1358
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,840
Like, there was all these You Don't Know Jack games back in the day, like You Don't Know Jack the Ride and all this stuff.

1359
01:39:43,840 --> 01:40:09,840
Those are actually kind of cool.
