1
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:15,485
[SPEAKER_03]: and I November 7th, 2010.

2
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:25,278
[SPEAKER_03]: The new Xbox Kinect dashboard is designed to thwart pirates, Capcom brings retro arcade to the i-family, and as Microsoft swept indie games under the rug,

3
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:32,683
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

4
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:53,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Knights of the Old Sorority, I was telling you, or whatever this is.

5
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:59,087
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Knights of the Crystals on Facebook, but it's just sorority life with Final Fantasy characters.

6
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:01,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to stop playing this now.

7
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:02,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're no fun at all.

8
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:04,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play it after the show.

9
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being responsible.

10
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you should concentrate on the show.

11
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:07,591
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I save?

12
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:08,352
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be plenty of time.

13
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:08,972
[SPEAKER_05]: You just close it.

14
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:09,832
[SPEAKER_05]: It saves as you go.

15
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,454
[SPEAKER_05]: The internet is a modern miracle.

16
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:14,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

17
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:15,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

18
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:16,656
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Loki?

19
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:17,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

20
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:18,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a good week off, everybody?

21
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:20,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's fun.

22
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:21,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have a week off.

23
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, what'd you do?

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Recorded another podcast.

25
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, you had the other show.

26
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:29,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, I started a new show too, so you're not the only one that gets to plug a show now.

27
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:30,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha!

28
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:31,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

29
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:31,526
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

30
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:32,827
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have a thing to do.

31
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:37,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we only taped a pilot, so we're not really a show yet, because I don't have a place to host it.

32
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:38,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a pilot light?

33
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:41,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it just means, is the show going to work or not?

34
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:42,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the Frankenstein place.

35
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:44,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I'll get into that in a minute.

36
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:45,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about other side projects in a moment.

37
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:59,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to introduce, of course, as always, our fourth guest, always here with us, the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, live on this Sunday evening as we tape at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

38
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:01,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Every Sunday night is when we tape Orange Lounge Radio.

39
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, right after the Bobby Blackwell show, of course, I've got to plug Bobby because he's always been there.

40
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:12,138
[SPEAKER_05]: He calls himself the opening act, but I don't see it as a lesser billing.

41
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:15,961
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a smart guy, knows a lot about gaming, so tune into his show sometime if you haven't already.

42
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, we're going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week.

43
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:20,045
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always how they start the show.

44
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:22,566
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back from a week off.

45
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:27,167
[SPEAKER_05]: One week ago was Halloween, so we just decided, you know what, let's just take a weekend off.

46
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:28,848
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot going on in the real world.

47
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:33,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a bunch of stuff to do for one of my other hobbies, so we didn't even tape a show.

48
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,530
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Loki's got the baby.

49
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,672
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's got, I guess, other podcasts now that are bigger than this little shit show.

50
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,512
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have a big, fat, hairy cat.

51
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:41,312
[SPEAKER_05]: You do?

52
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:42,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has Twitter?

53
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:43,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Shermie has Twitter.

54
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:44,714
[SPEAKER_05]: When did Shermie get a Twitter?

55
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:45,614
[SPEAKER_02]: A few days ago.

56
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:47,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Who signed her up for Twitter?

57
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:48,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that you or was that a fan?

58
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:50,076
[SPEAKER_02]: That was me.

59
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

60
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,844
[SPEAKER_05]: But she does all the typing, right?

61
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:54,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

62
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,540
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I have to deal with sitting in that chair.

63
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,320
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't do it to you.

64
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:24,561
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

65
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:26,042
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because Rob's feet smell.

66
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:26,942
[SPEAKER_05]: My feet are smelly.

67
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:29,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's quickly plug the side projects.

68
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:31,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually we'll save this for the end of the show because this was brought up a minute ago.

69
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:35,087
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you have a side project called?

70
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Comic Insanity.

71
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:40,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insanity without an I in the front of it.

72
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's only one I and not two.

73
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:46,273
[SPEAKER_02]: That's at Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

74
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:48,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And we go live on Tuesdays.

75
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:49,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

76
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:54,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just comic books, although today we were without a Maren Marvel.

77
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:55,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

78
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:57,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because she has a new house or something.

79
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:57,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,700
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

81
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard, hard, hard.

82
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:07,143
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's me and Tiara, Maren Marvel, and Dan Shadow.

83
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:08,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

84
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:10,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Who plays WoW with me now.

85
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Who plays WoW with you now.

86
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:12,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, good times.

87
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,467
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't play WoW with you.

88
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:19,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, both Marvel and Dan Shadow play WoW with me, but not you.

89
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a sheep.

90
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:21,593
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine, that's fine.

91
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of WoW... I play Star Trek.

92
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:25,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of WoW, that's my new side project.

93
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Extifer and I have reunited.

94
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:37,941
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that listened to OLR back when it was a station, before the whole merger with All Games some time ago, we were doing a show called Guys on a Show, which is more like a pop culture thing, but now we do a Warcraft show.

95
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:39,222
[SPEAKER_05]: We just did a pilot...

96
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:40,663
[SPEAKER_05]: The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth

97
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the name Is it Disneyland right now?

98
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:31,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says guys on an MMO

99
00:05:46,764 --> 00:06:14,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play some Star Trek online and finally now that I have a shiny new headset I've been able to play on TeamSpeak with my Scottish guildmates or fleetmates I should say and I love listening to Scottish accents a whole lot actually one of the other guys I think in Holland and one of the other guys was in New York when we're playing we have another guy in Hawaii there's I think like three or four of us who live in the United States the rest all live in the UK and other places in Europe

100
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:16,079
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty fun.

101
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:22,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I only get to see them when it's like before four here because then it's, you know, close to midnight there.

102
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:29,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I... Okay, Rob, don't hate.

103
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:30,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't judge me.

104
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Judging.

105
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting ready to judge.

106
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Gavel raised.

107
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:35,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Second Life.

108
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:42,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I could see what the stupid Na'vi universe looks like.

109
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:45,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

110
00:06:46,296 --> 00:06:49,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's because I... You are guilty of nerddom!

111
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

112
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:57,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wanted to see... I said, you know, before I actually judged Second Life, I was going to see what it's like.

113
00:06:58,847 --> 00:06:59,447
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fair.

114
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:06,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you should try something... And I figured I would go to... Even if it's dressing up as a big smurf and running around...

115
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:13,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I said instead of doing, you know, I would try to do something that I couldn't really do in another game online.

116
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:18,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I kind of, I thought it would be a great idea for them to do like an Avatar MMO.

117
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that thing would be lose all self-respect.

118
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:21,501
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

119
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:28,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've only been on it like four times just running around and going, oh, this is pretty, oh, this is pretty.

120
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:30,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Second Life controls like shit.

121
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:32,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Just letting you all know.

122
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,547
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat on there sucks.

123
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:36,188
[SPEAKER_04]: It controls like it is.

124
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:42,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And... I... It was free, okay?

125
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,544
[SPEAKER_05]: In our chatroom, salaciouspop at chat.orangelondradio.com says, I am jumping in front of Jamie in slow motion going, No!

126
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:51,705
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a terrorist bomb counts down to zero.

127
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:57,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, get some self-respect.

128
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Play a Harry Potter universe if you have to.

129
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

130
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:02,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just... I'm messing with you.

131
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:09,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at any rate, it's not horrible.

132
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:14,811
[SPEAKER_02]: But after seeing some of the other stuff on there, I was like, yeah, I don't really have to play this that much.

133
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:16,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually got a good game to play.

134
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:17,452
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Rock Band 3.

135
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:21,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So we played a lot of Rock Band 3 since a few days ago.

136
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:23,575
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually got it on Halloween.

137
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:25,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been playing it since then.

138
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:26,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

139
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:29,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think what else because I've played a lot of games.

140
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys get the keyboard?

141
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:31,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did.

142
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:32,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tried it?

143
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:33,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like it.

144
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:38,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurts my hand after a while because I want to hold the right keyboard position and it makes my hand hurt.

145
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan has beaten Fable 3 within a few days of getting the game.

146
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,270
[SPEAKER_05]: My pro tip to everybody...

147
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:11,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you have six million gold by the time you actually beat that part of the game.

148
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:17,406
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time you're the king or queen or whatever you're going to be.

149
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:26,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all the voices in that game because seriously, Jonathan Ross is in it doing announcement when you're beating up monsters and I love it.

150
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:28,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Jonathan Ross.

151
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,967
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one with the slight speech impediment.

152
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:38,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he speaks with the ahs and not the ahs.

153
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:40,813
[SPEAKER_05]: How's Fable 3 similar or different?

154
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Simon Pegg does voices in it.

155
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:42,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I love him.

156
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:48,739
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, somebody came to Rocky, which was the thing I was doing last week and not here at the show.

157
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,039
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a costume contest.

158
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,061
[SPEAKER_05]: The winner was dressed up as Sean from Shaun of the Dead.

159
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:53,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like A+.

160
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:54,222
[SPEAKER_05]: It was perfect.

161
00:09:54,242 --> 00:09:55,423
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy looked the part and everything.

162
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:56,063
[SPEAKER_02]: A+.

163
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to glomp on him.

164
00:10:00,186 --> 00:10:02,688
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you were saying how does it play?

165
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:05,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, how's Fable 3 compared to the last one, Fable 2?

166
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,591
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got lots of good and lots of bad.

167
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:15,196
[SPEAKER_02]: The quest thing, instead of being able to just change your quests and things, you don't even have a menu anymore.

168
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:24,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You go back to this sanctuary, and then if you're trying to find a person to start a particular quest, it doesn't always teleport you right to them.

169
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:26,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Rob's going to give us diseases.

170
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:28,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

171
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:28,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

172
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:30,186
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

173
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:32,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I have stuff going on.

174
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:33,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to do eye drops every three hours.

175
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:33,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's a zombie.

176
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:34,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time.

177
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm a zombie.

178
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Brains.

179
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:38,852
[SPEAKER_02]: But, no.

180
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:39,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Navi.

181
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:40,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

182
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:44,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But, it's not bad.

183
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:47,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's definitely a lot of glitchiness in it.

184
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:54,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what really sucks is that when you have to take people places, you can't just tell them to follow you.

185
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:58,405
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to hold their hand and take them with you.

186
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:00,706
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's really irritating.

187
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:07,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I can see the seam on the dog and the textures and it's kind of meh.

188
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Dogs do have seams though.

189
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:11,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but not like that.

190
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:14,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Not from the top of their head to the base of their tail.

191
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:15,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure they do.

192
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,957
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd expect you to see stitches or something.

193
00:11:19,657 --> 00:11:22,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then there's, like, a bunch of annoying people.

194
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I love one of the, quote, bad guys in the game, Reaver.

195
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:29,966
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just so ostentatious.

196
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:30,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I love him.

197
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's so evil and such a bastard.

198
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:34,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I love him to death.

199
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:35,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

200
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:43,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played Robot Unicorn Attack in the middle of Starbucks at 11 o'clock last night.

201
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:54,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we had one of mine and Dan's friends over beat Little Nemo, the Dream Master, on Nintendo in our vault last night.

202
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:55,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, random.

203
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,957
[SPEAKER_02]: That game's actually kind of hard, you know?

204
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a bunch of other stuff too.

205
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:03,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat Peggle Knights.

206
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:05,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually kind of hard.

207
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:09,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's harder than the first Peggle.

208
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of plants versus zombies.

209
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:14,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost done growing my tree of life.

210
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:20,634
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, the Tree of Knowledge or whatever the crap the tree is.

211
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:23,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Tree of Worthless Advice is what it is.

212
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:25,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then.

213
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:27,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff I've already figured out, but you get an achievement for it, so whatever.

214
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:36,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and for anyone who has beaten mustache mode, all you have to do is just type mustache while you're playing and all the zombies will get mustaches and you'll be in mustache mode.

215
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

216
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's completely retarded.

217
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how stupid that game is.

218
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've played a bunch of stuff this week.

219
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and I played Dance Masters tonight.

220
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:54,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did Pala Pala dancing.

221
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:57,162
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think of Dance Masters on the Xbox Kinect?

222
00:12:57,562 --> 00:12:58,423
[SPEAKER_02]: The other dance game.

223
00:12:58,703 --> 00:12:59,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked Para Para.

224
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,076
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

225
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:35,619
[SPEAKER_02]: They were playing Dance Central and there's this little solo freestyle part in it and Rob was going in and shaking his butt and jumping up and down.

226
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it plays back in high speed.

227
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:40,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob peeking out, Rob peeking out, Rob's butt.

228
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:46,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just see Loki kind of flailing.

229
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:49,266
[SPEAKER_02]: He was actually doing stuff but when it speeds it up it looks like he's flailing.

230
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:51,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of what the Kinect is.

231
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:52,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Microsoft flail.

232
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:54,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Microsoft flail.

233
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:55,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

234
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,875
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm going to call it from now on.

235
00:13:56,915 --> 00:13:58,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

236
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:00,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Bam!

237
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what I'm going to take a picture of.

238
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:03,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you do that.

239
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:12,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I found a bunch of our video game soundtracks so we've been ripping them and I found a VCD of Parapara Panic Volume 2 and 3.

240
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:14,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

241
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I also found a Parapara DVD that belongs to Loki.

242
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:19,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Random.

243
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:20,444
[SPEAKER_02]: The Parapara Master.

244
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:21,305
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, that ain't mine.

245
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:23,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Parapara Master?

246
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:25,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you loaned it to me like five years ago.

247
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:26,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember that.

248
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

249
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:30,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, everybody else.

250
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:31,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to the chat room real quick.

251
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:40,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator in our chat room says, if someone were to put ABBA, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Dance Central, and SingStar into a blender and then puked out the resulting game, Sky would probably squeal.

252
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:42,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably.

253
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:44,807
[SPEAKER_05]: It stinks!

254
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It was okay, I guess.

255
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:09,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the message at the end, but otherwise it was censored and dopey.

256
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:10,755
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

257
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:12,116
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Kidz Bop.

258
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:17,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you want to talk about digging through old treasures?

259
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It must have been something I got for free when I was ordering VCDs.

260
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Get VCDs.com, special price.

261
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:26,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Must have been free.

262
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're Gaming Week, yes.

263
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:29,275
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

264
00:15:56,451 --> 00:16:00,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I started off playing some of the demos for Joyride and Dance Central.

265
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:08,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And really the demo for Dance Central, which is on the disc, so if they put it on Xbox Live Marketplace, you don't really need to download it because it's already on the disc.

266
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:17,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only got two songs on the demo, which were Poker Face by Lady Gaga and Poison.

267
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:23,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Poison is a lot more difficult than Poker Face, that's for sure, because...

268
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, Poker Face, that was really easy.

269
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:28,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go in the poison.

270
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:30,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay, break it down.

271
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:31,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Do this.

272
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:34,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I can't do that.

273
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Some 90s dance moves and stuff.

274
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:49,211
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think actually if you play through Dance Central, through the songs in the actual order that they're in there, from easiest to hardest, I think it would be a lot easier to pick up some of the stuff because some of the moves are just...

275
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:53,394
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little tough for me to wrap my brain around it.

276
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:55,596
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's a fun game.

277
00:16:55,856 --> 00:17:01,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Dance Masters a little bit, or I should say I watched Dance Masters a little bit.

278
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:10,727
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing that's really frustrating about that game, although I have to say I didn't try the lesson modes, so maybe that breaks it down a little bit more, but...

279
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:14,669
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically says, okay, go.

280
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it starts doing stuff and you start messing up because you don't know what the hell you're supposed to be doing.

281
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

282
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just act confused.

283
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:31,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless, of course, you've played lots of Parapar and you know some of the Parapar dances, in which case there's at least four songs you'll be able to do just fine.

284
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,753
[SPEAKER_04]: But the rest of them are just very confusing.

285
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,034
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of songs from DDR.

286
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:38,935
[SPEAKER_04]: A ton of songs from DDR.

287
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:51,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything from the Parapar songs to Sakura, Exotic Ethnic, Let the Beat Hit Em, Keep on Movin', Higher...

288
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:54,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think of some of the other songs that were in there.

289
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, a lot of DDR stuff.

290
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:05,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, as Rob was saying when he was actually looking at the game, the game looks a lot better than Dance Central.

291
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was surprised.

292
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:10,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Masters is actually a better looking game than Dance Central.

293
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:10,736
[SPEAKER_05]: The way...

294
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,302
[SPEAKER_05]: is a lot cooler than those little flashcards going up the side.

295
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:23,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the flashcards going up the side makes the dance, in practicality, like you said, it's easier to learn that way, whereas it's just kind of like throw it in and do it.

296
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:31,894
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're just kind of trying to show off the poses and stuff, I think with the silhouettes collapsing in and the rings that show up, I think the game looks awesome.

297
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:37,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think if you were to pull it off the way you're supposed to, which I know some folks might be surprised.

298
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:39,601
[SPEAKER_05]: They were expecting me to come on here and say Dance Masters is full of fail.

299
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:40,342
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's...

300
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Some interesting parts in there.

301
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:45,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the interface itself is pretty sleek when you're playing the game.

302
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:46,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the look a lot.

303
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:55,273
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting as far as some of the songs that are in there and stuff, because I think it'd be fun to see what the routines are for them.

304
00:18:55,654 --> 00:18:59,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, and this goes for both games, there are some songs like, for example...

305
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:10,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Poker Face and stuff that I would feel like an idiot doing, you know, in real life versus, you know, some of the songs, you know, like Poison and stuff that have really good dance steps to them.

306
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:25,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously they have to simple, you know, have some simple songs in there so you can learn it because, you know, a lot of it's like, oh, I could do that, but it's actually really hard sometimes to figure out what they want you to do and you have to kind of do it a few times, Bill, to understand what you need to do in the game, but...

307
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:26,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Masters.

308
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:30,669
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I don't like about Dance Masters is the actual menus.

309
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:37,071
[SPEAKER_04]: The way they have you navigate it is not very intuitive, and a lot of times they end up selecting things they didn't want to select.

310
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:39,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that Dance Central?

311
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:40,353
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Dance Masters.

312
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:41,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I have problems with Dance Central.

313
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:48,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's just the Kinect device itself, but trying to select a song is a pain in the ass sometimes on Dance Central.

314
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

315
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:54,417
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing with Dance Central, though, is you can actually use the controller to select stuff if you want to.

316
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:55,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, didn't even try it.

317
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:56,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

318
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Derp, derp.

319
00:19:57,938 --> 00:19:59,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

320
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:01,859
[SPEAKER_04]: And then other things... Can I say this real quick, though, about Dance Central?

321
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:03,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those moves are kind of embarrassing, too.

322
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,579
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Dance Central.

323
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we keep kind of going back and forth between the dance moves.

324
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they are.

325
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the easiest way to remember.

326
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Central has real songs.

327
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Masters has DDR songs.

328
00:20:14,182 --> 00:20:14,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, which...

329
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:18,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize some people consider them real songs.

330
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:24,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean to spit in the eye of what we grew up on, but it's not music you're going to hear out in the real world.

331
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:31,587
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a fan of DDR and you buy Dance Masters, you probably think, oh, originally, you're like, okay, well, I know para stuff is going to be in there.

332
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,368
[SPEAKER_04]: You think, oh, it's just all para-para dancing.

333
00:20:33,988 --> 00:21:00,199
[SPEAKER_05]: well they have like a lot of songs from DDR and it was kind of cool to see a lot of that stuff on there but there's really only a couple songs that weren't in DDR or at least I didn't recognize in DDR I think though those of you guys that like grew up on DDR and have been playing for years and years ever logged into if you had an account on DDR Freak at any point in time go buy Dance Masters the rest of you get Dance Central that's that's really how it kind of breaks down

334
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:12,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Central I like because a long time ago I actually took a dance class and the way they teach you how to do the different routines is the way you would learn it in a dance class, which is kind of cool.

335
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:19,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy that game a lot more because you get an idea of what you're supposed to do, even though they do have the flashcards.

336
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:24,986
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's not for you, if you know the routine and you just want to do it, you can turn those flashcards off.

337
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:53,134
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody who's ever loved Para Para Paradise or even liked it you need to get Dance Masters because it basically is Para Para Paradise under a different name and just a different gameplay mechanic but like the Night of Fire dance is the same dance yes it is it's something remember like way back in the day I was like hey you know what would be kind of cool is if they had a para game with like different genres of music in there not just para para that's Dance Masters it's basically funny

338
00:21:54,055 --> 00:22:02,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go back to Dance Central for a minute, because Loki was talking about some of the embarrassing dance moves that happened in that game, and I'll tell you, I don't know if you've tried, have you played, you haven't really played the demo, or outside the demo, huh?

339
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:04,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, not too much, no.

340
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I was playing the full version I was playing, there's a song by M.I.A.

341
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:13,730
[SPEAKER_05]: called Galang, and I don't know if you've ever heard this song, but let me play a little bit of it for the listeners here in, uh, listening to the song.

342
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:21,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, this is an awesome song, yeah, I really like this song, but like, the way you dance to this song, it's like you like...

343
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:23,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Central?

344
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:24,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Masters.

345
00:22:47,004 --> 00:22:48,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell them apart!

346
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:52,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Central, I'm surprised that they didn't have that because they have all the moves broken down.

347
00:22:52,549 --> 00:23:00,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be able to just order them in a way to create a routine and it wouldn't be that difficult for the actual on-screen dancers to follow it.

348
00:23:00,576 --> 00:23:01,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Central...

349
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,400
[SPEAKER_05]: is very much a first game, as is Dance Masters.

350
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:18,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you have to go, okay, Dance Central is like the first Guitar Hero game, which led to Guitar Hero 2, which led to Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3, which led to where we're at now with Rock Band 3.

351
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:25,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So the potential is there for something really cool, but this first game is definitely like a bare-bones thing.

352
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,896
[SPEAKER_05]: But it'll be a hit at parties.

353
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:28,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Either one will be, really.

354
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:29,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be pretty fun.

355
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:47,244
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple reasons why I bought it.

356
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,325
[SPEAKER_04]: One, because it looked fun.

357
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:51,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And two, it was one of the games I was able to get early.

358
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:55,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also Kinect Sports, which I actually haven't touched yet.

359
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:58,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't really give any impressions on it.

360
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:05,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I do still want to get possibly your self-fitness or your shape fitness or whatever the hell it's called.

361
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:11,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to try that out because right now I can't get out to the gym even if I wanted to.

362
00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:13,459
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just no time of the day.

363
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it would be nice to have some sort of exercise program.

364
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:25,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, I would prefer getting the EA Sports Active 2.01 because it looks like it's a lot more structured.

365
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:29,933
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have a nine-week program you can go through and a bunch of neat features for that.

366
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:31,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Problem is, it's $100.

367
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:37,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really don't want to spend $100 on a game, even if it does work out pretty well.

368
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

369
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:41,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

370
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:45,006
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be neat to just try that stuff because it looks like that might work pretty well.

371
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:47,669
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I'm looking forward to more stuff.

372
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:57,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully they actually start having indie games and Xbox Live Arcade games that support Kinect stuff and hopefully we get into some more different types of games other than stuff.

373
00:24:57,658 --> 00:25:00,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing the different genres.

374
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:03,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Because all the games that are launched are like dance, fitness...

375
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:09,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Interpretations of Wii games from their launch party.

376
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:15,276
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have yet to see how is Kinect going to affect Gears of War, if at all.

377
00:25:16,037 --> 00:25:16,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Please hear me out.

378
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:19,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying every game needs to have Kinect shoved in it.

379
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:21,664
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, that would make me very disappointed.

380
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,467
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm saying a Gears of War-esque...

381
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:28,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you think you need to go too crazy with some of that stuff.

382
00:25:28,648 --> 00:25:35,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be neat to have a game where you play it on the couch, it just supports Kinect, but you're still using the controller.

383
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:47,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Say, for example, you're peeking around a corner or something, you just lean with your controller in hand, you lean to the side and your character peeks around the corner instead of you having to hit a button or something like that.

384
00:25:47,574 --> 00:25:51,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Just really subtle stuff.

385
00:25:51,795 --> 00:26:00,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you need to actually flail around or something, but I think adding a little bit of extra stuff or maybe voice commands to different things might be kind of neat.

386
00:26:03,106 --> 00:26:04,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do it tastefully.

387
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:06,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have Halo Connect.

388
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:21,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And something you touched on a little bit there that I wanted to definitely mention and expand on a little bit is the more minority report style stuff that's in the Xbox Kinect, meaning that it will identify your face and sign you in.

389
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,201
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to calibrate.

390
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:25,463
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go through this somewhat extensive calibration in Kinect ID.

391
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:32,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And for it to work really well, you have to do it in the daytime, in the nighttime, with all your lights on, with some of your lights on.

392
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:33,429
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to do it a few times.

393
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:33,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rob, but...

394
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:51,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey girl, what it do?

395
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:52,268
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not going to do that, okay?

396
00:26:52,368 --> 00:26:57,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like... But I will not have to pick up a controller at all.

397
00:26:57,752 --> 00:27:05,679
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I have gone so far as to eject the game, put in the new game, walk away, and then I'll go Xbox, connect, close tray.

398
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:08,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And it knows who I am, starts and closes the tray.

399
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:09,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's...

400
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:13,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of scary in some regards, but neat.

401
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see that expanded on, though, because it's very limited right now.

402
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:18,485
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only very certain commands.

403
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,126
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't be like, Xbox, paint my house.

404
00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:25,608
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to know how to do anything but close the tray and go to your friends list.

405
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:34,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, the fact that actually those voice commands work with pretty much anybody.

406
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,151
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife is yelling stuff.

407
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:39,612
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, I can hear a fear through stuff without...

408
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:40,542
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

409
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:13,987
[SPEAKER_04]: The nice little calibration cards that come with a lot of the games that are high contrast, black and white.

410
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:15,047
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they do?

411
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:16,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for calibrating the system.

412
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:17,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I have yet to use them.

413
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:19,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can use it to calibrate the system.

414
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:29,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little smiley face, and it's placed so that the glasses are on the smiley face, and so you move it back and forth, and it calibrates the sensor to get distance or whatever.

415
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:31,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is that?

416
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:31,532
[SPEAKER_05]: In the dashboard?

417
00:28:31,552 --> 00:28:31,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

418
00:28:33,232 --> 00:28:34,953
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the little Kinect dashboard thing.

419
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:36,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it once.

420
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:38,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, but that's not the point.

421
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:48,137
[SPEAKER_04]: The point is my son loves staring at that thing and just like plays with it and just like and smiling is so happy.

422
00:28:48,157 --> 00:28:50,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally his favorite toy now.

423
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:55,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I'm just saying you could go get like a little piece of cardboard at Target for like 10 cents and a Sharpie marker.

424
00:28:55,939 --> 00:28:57,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make a million of those.

425
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know that, but I'm just saying it's an added bonus.

426
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:02,722
[SPEAKER_04]: because they come with a bunch of them.

427
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:06,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I got it with it and it says, do not throw this away.

428
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what the hell is this?

429
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:10,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have to hold this in front of the camera or something?

430
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:12,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room is echoing you.

431
00:29:12,948 --> 00:29:14,249
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the Connect Tuner on the Connect Hub.

432
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:15,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I went through that setup.

433
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a whole nother calibration I didn't even do?

434
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:18,871
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another calibration setup.

435
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:19,412
[SPEAKER_05]: God.

436
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:21,413
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of calibrating to do with this.

437
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:22,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, that's the other thing too.

438
00:29:22,473 --> 00:29:26,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been working fine without all that fine calibration except the fact that I live in a tiny apartment and don't have a lot of space.

439
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:34,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that only means that you can't play Connected Adventures two-player because it requires eight feet or whatever in order to play two players on that.

440
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:37,421
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the other games don't really give a crap.

441
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:41,885
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'd say Jamie's living room here, that was maybe like six feet.

442
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:43,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it worked.

443
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:44,107
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked just fine.

444
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no problem with that little par-par-a.

445
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just Connect Adventures, I think, is really... I don't even know if it necessarily needs that.

446
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:54,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that they don't want you smacking into each other.

447
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you done the video chat at all?

448
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:57,713
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

449
00:29:58,233 --> 00:29:59,333
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really creepy.

450
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Try it, because the Connect will follow you around.

451
00:30:02,154 --> 00:30:03,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I was sitting in the chair.

452
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:05,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I wasn't actually chatting with anyone, but you can see your window.

453
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:08,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like, if I stand up, like, the Connect follows me.

454
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:12,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I kind of move... Like, it follows you around, which is kind of creepy.

455
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:13,217
[SPEAKER_05]: You can only move up and down, right?

456
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:17,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa Congusto I do not want a system that hits on me or notices if I have gained weight

457
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:33,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that would be a terrible one, wouldn't it?

458
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:35,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox, connect.

459
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Rob.

460
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:39,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you might want to stop eating donuts.

461
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were having a feature or there was something.

462
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:47,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was in one of those, like, you know, here's what it possibly can do.

463
00:30:47,183 --> 00:30:50,004
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where I'm scanning my skateboard and that bull crap.

464
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:55,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Where, like, it could scan your image and it makes an avatar character out of that.

465
00:30:55,612 --> 00:31:00,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what's also going to be interesting is what future firmware updates will do because the technology is there now.

466
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:02,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's about really kind of squeezing out the potential of it.

467
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:08,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of curious to see what next year's update will bring because it's probably more of this stuff.

468
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably more like browsing.

469
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:12,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't probably be just like you'll be able to browse the marketplace or something like that.

470
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:14,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Masters fact sheet.

471
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:16,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there is a lesson mode.

472
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:21,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would be nice because stepping right into the dance mode is like, huh?

473
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:21,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

474
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:22,199
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

475
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:23,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else for your gaming week?

476
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:30,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, other than Xbox and Kinect stuff, well, actually, I played Rock Band 3 briefly.

477
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:32,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got around to it.

478
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:37,258
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my systems actually died on me, and I had it fixed, so that was nice.

479
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:50,946
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played, well, I spent a lot of the time just recreating my band, the, what was it, Unfit Barf Bags, because that was the random band name it gave me in Rock Band 2.

480
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:53,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just stuck with it, and it was funny.

481
00:31:54,027 --> 00:31:57,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to try that out, it was awesome I thought it was relatively easy for keyboard though

482
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:24,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and of course, I didn't bother doing keyboards in normal mode because that's just retarded with the five keys.

483
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I stuck with the pro mode and just stick with easy.

484
00:32:27,683 --> 00:32:31,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you actually want to be able to play things like Bohemian Rhapsody, you got to do five key.

485
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why can't you just play it on easy?

486
00:32:34,406 --> 00:32:35,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, yeah, you can do it on easy.

487
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:36,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can do easy in promo.

488
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the way to do it.

489
00:32:39,631 --> 00:32:40,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a little bit of both.

490
00:32:40,753 --> 00:32:47,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I can actually beat Just Like Heaven and Imagine on, like, expert pro keys, but it took a little while to kind of get there.

491
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:50,182
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's cool that I can do it after practicing.

492
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:52,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I had problems with, you know...

493
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:54,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

494
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:12,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I had my hands too far to the left

495
00:33:38,538 --> 00:34:04,157
[SPEAKER_04]: tried that tried a little bit of Sonic 4 Episode 1 on the iPod and it's terrible as I figured it would be thankfully I didn't buy it and what else oh yeah a little bit of Space Invaders Infinity Gene which I love that game it's pretty awesome that's pretty much it

496
00:34:05,182 --> 00:34:05,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

497
00:34:21,073 --> 00:34:26,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Central, which is fine, but the interface bugs me and doesn't control very well.

498
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:29,878
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that I know about this extra calibration stuff, maybe I need to try that.

499
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:34,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So now that I know, and knowing's half the battle, I'll try that a little more.

500
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,342
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise, the dances are kind of fun, and it's a pretty good workout.

501
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:40,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the best thing about Connect, is that it's a good workout.

502
00:34:40,343 --> 00:34:42,285
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a calorie counter for the Dance Central.

503
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:42,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed.

504
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:43,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, oh yeah, I turned it on.

505
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:44,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.

506
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:47,347
[SPEAKER_05]: The photo mode's a little creepy.

507
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:48,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I might need to turn that off.

508
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:53,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like being required to wear pants to play Xbox in my own house.

509
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, with the Connect Adventures stuff, there's that ConnectShare.com website.

510
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

511
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm afraid that one day I'm going to be sitting there playing with no pants on.

512
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:04,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, it's the privacy of my own house.

513
00:35:05,112 --> 00:35:05,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, guys.

514
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:07,532
[SPEAKER_05]: You know pants are restrictive.

515
00:35:07,812 --> 00:35:09,393
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes you like to play with no pants.

516
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:12,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing in my pajamas.

517
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:20,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I'll do now because I am like deathly afraid that the machine is going to take a picture of me and like upload it to my Facebook without me knowing.

518
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:24,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realize this is a totally irrational fear and like, yes, these modes can be turned off.

519
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:30,545
[SPEAKER_05]: But come on, like it's like this part of technology kind of freaks me out or it's like suddenly, you know.

520
00:35:31,815 --> 00:35:34,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's going to know if it's boxers or briefs.

521
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:38,999
[SPEAKER_05]: There's certain things that my Facebook friends do not need to know about.

522
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And what color I'm wearing today is one of them.

523
00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:44,301
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

524
00:35:45,082 --> 00:35:45,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

525
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:47,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyhow.

526
00:35:49,042 --> 00:35:49,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumble, jumble, jumble

527
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, look, I swear I didn't even look at you.

528
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:20,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Jessica Harper's in our chat tonight.

529
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:21,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, I'd play braless.

530
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:23,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I call it or did I call it?

531
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:23,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

532
00:36:24,177 --> 00:36:29,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first thing that I did after Loki was setting up the connectors, I went in and put on a sports bra.

533
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:33,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I didn't want to kill myself.

534
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:34,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jess.

535
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:35,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Jessica's backing me up here.

536
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:37,209
[SPEAKER_05]: My house is a bra-free zone, 100%.

537
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,569
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

538
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:42,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Kitsune says, I don't want people to see me in my undies, so I got to make sure I wear pants.

539
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,110
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the same completely irrational fear that I have.

540
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:55,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, with this technology, the way it is, like, I need something in the intro to the game to assure me, hi, Rob, I promise I won't take pictures of you with no pants on.

541
00:36:56,072 --> 00:36:56,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll be fine.

542
00:36:56,772 --> 00:37:01,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, as long as the Connect and I have that mutual understanding that we're not taking pictures, I'll be fine.

543
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:07,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, now remember now, here's something to be afraid of, I guess.

544
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:10,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in fact, actually, I guess it doesn't really shine too much of a spot.

545
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:19,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember those, I think they were Sony cameras, actually, that had an infrared filter mode or something like that, and people were using them to see through people's clothes?

546
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:23,188
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not matter with the Kinect camera.

547
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:27,011
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be undressing you with its lenses.

548
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:27,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

549
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:34,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf says, to be fair, ConnectShare.com only shows your own photos or videos that you upload from the game.

550
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:37,977
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't find anyone else's stuff.

551
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:39,618
[SPEAKER_05]: There's hackers out there, Bobby.

552
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:41,819
[SPEAKER_05]: They're hacking everyone on out here.

553
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:45,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Hide your pants, hide your bras.

554
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:47,030
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I want, though, with the Kinect?

555
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:52,634
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that it shoots infrared lights in a really neat pattern across the room.

556
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:55,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a laser light show, damn it, because it's already doing that.

557
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:56,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I want it so that I can see it.

558
00:37:57,178 --> 00:38:02,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the Michael Jackson game that's coming out should do Michael Jackson laser shows, like the one I saw in Seattle last year.

559
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:09,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I the only one that feels like I should not look directly into the Kinect because there's that little red light that looks like a laser, which I'm sure is the infrared thing.

560
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:10,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a laser.

561
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:14,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, have you ever caught yourself staring right into it going, this isn't a good idea?

562
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

563
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:18,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the mind control device.

564
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:18,651
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Skynet.

565
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:23,153
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, wait a second, I recognize that red lint in your eye.

566
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:24,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You're Terminator.

567
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:26,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Sent back from the future to kill me.

568
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:29,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh oh, look what I started in chat.

569
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:32,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.orange.com Satellite minded.

570
00:38:32,536 --> 00:38:34,016
[SPEAKER_05]: They're climbing in your windows.

571
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:35,576
[SPEAKER_05]: They're snatching your pictures up.

572
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:40,378
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what I'm talking about.

573
00:38:41,983 --> 00:38:42,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

574
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:46,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

575
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:47,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes, other things I played this week.

576
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I also played Rock Band 3.

577
00:38:49,332 --> 00:38:50,734
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I loves me some keyboards.

578
00:38:51,094 --> 00:39:01,387
[SPEAKER_05]: My least favorite thing about Rock Band 3 is that there's not enough songs to play with the keyboards because I have like 300 songs in my library now thanks to Rock Band 1, Rock Band 2, all the download stuff which is a really obscene amount.

579
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope they go back soon and add the key support.

580
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:07,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I know it's supposed to be coming, so I'll stop bitching.

581
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,249
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the only thing that bugs me about it.

582
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:11,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I think it's a fantastic upgrade.

583
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:15,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you own Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 1, drop the extra money.

584
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Drop the 50, 60 bucks and get this.

585
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,871
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole dropping in and out will be great for parties.

586
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:23,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the song select mode and being able to filter stuff is so much more intuitive.

587
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:25,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they really have learned.

588
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,213
[SPEAKER_05]: They have just created an incredible music game.

589
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:28,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really makes me go...

590
00:39:28,473 --> 00:39:30,094
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell are we going to get in Rock Band 4?

591
00:39:30,274 --> 00:39:31,255
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sorting is awesome.

592
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:32,276
[SPEAKER_04]: This is already blowing my mind.

593
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:34,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the sorting is outstanding.

594
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:35,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Outstanding.

595
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:39,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick, just because it does kind of tie into the whole Kinect thing.

596
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:40,963
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of the new dashboard?

597
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:44,306
[SPEAKER_05]: It's purpley.

598
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:46,247
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that different from the old one.

599
00:39:46,387 --> 00:39:51,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, how much have they tried to kind of emulate the Wii?

600
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:52,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on down to the whole little...

601
00:39:56,149 --> 00:40:06,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Little background noises that you hear when you're in the... Kind of what it sounds like when you're in the menus.

602
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:08,179
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the cuteness.

603
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:11,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like how white it is.

604
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,924
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been inspired from Nintendo.

605
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:16,025
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a problem with white things?

606
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:16,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

607
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:18,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear that.

608
00:40:28,013 --> 00:40:32,277
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf says they are adding Bon Jovi keyboard support this week, so they're going through the back catalog.

609
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:33,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, I know.

610
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:35,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just impatient.

611
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,001
[SPEAKER_05]: So what if I have 63 songs to play right now?

612
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:38,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not enough.

613
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:42,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, some of the keyboard parts are really dopey.

614
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:43,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, um...

615
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Everybody Wants to Rule?

616
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,211
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that one, it's the other one.

617
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:51,253
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those songs, I always get the bands mixed up.

618
00:40:52,273 --> 00:40:54,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Tears for Fears is Everyone Wants to Rule the World, right?

619
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:54,874
[SPEAKER_05]: In Excess.

620
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:57,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Need You Tonight is the song.

621
00:40:57,595 --> 00:40:59,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Has the dumbest keyboard part ever.

622
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:02,757
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just 27 notes, even on expert.

623
00:41:02,817 --> 00:41:05,779
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just do, do, do, boo.

624
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:07,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the keyboard part.

625
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Do, do, do, wah.

626
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:18,318
[SPEAKER_05]: and so you're playing the wow like 27 times in the song it's ridiculous like you could beat it on expert and your score will be like 4700 tops this is funny

627
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:46,362
[SPEAKER_05]: but anyhow uh yeah um the game's fun and and the keyboard stuff will get better with the download packs and everything you know i'm actually like tempted to go find like a ten dollar copy of lego rock band just to import those songs into my massive collection i did i because i bet you can find them really cheap used now or not used uh with the code uh new new dude they still make it right

628
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:49,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can probably find it on Amazon or something.

629
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's dropped in price too much.

630
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:54,284
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I want to talk about a game no one's talked about yet, and then we'll get into gaming news.

631
00:41:54,384 --> 00:41:55,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've been doing this for a very long time.

632
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:56,825
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a lot of games this week.

633
00:41:57,466 --> 00:42:00,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinball FX 2 came out on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

634
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:01,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it, by the way.

635
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,748
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free, which is awesome.

636
00:42:04,228 --> 00:42:12,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you owned Pinball FX 1, the game will go, oh, hey, since you were a loyal Pinball FX 1 user, I'm going to just import those tables right on into Pinball FX 2.

637
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:16,043
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

638
00:42:36,781 --> 00:42:38,942
[SPEAKER_05]: and just all the different features that are in it now.

639
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:46,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly it does stuff with the Xbox Live vision camera, which made me laugh because now that everything's pushing Kinect, it's kind of funny that the vision camera's in there.

640
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it uses either or.

641
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:53,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not interested in playing pinball with a camera, but apparently it will take video of you when you're playing on Xbox Live.

642
00:42:53,387 --> 00:42:54,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I should try selling back my vision camera too.

643
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:56,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Like five bucks.

644
00:42:56,548 --> 00:42:58,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you can play Totem Ball.

645
00:42:58,849 --> 00:42:59,109
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

646
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Give you a nickel.

647
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:06,612
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I was just very happy that all the tables re-imported and they have a more robust demo system.

648
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:12,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, just you can sense that the physics have been upgraded and the interface has been upgraded and everything has gotten a little tweak.

649
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:14,695
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been talking about Rock Band, right?

650
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:15,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Same type of thing.

651
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:18,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Pimbal FX Pimbal FX

652
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:48,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at a game like this and I go, with Game Room being in the state that it's in right now, I want Zen Studios to get Game Room.

653
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:56,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Microsoft to give that to Zen Studios because they seem to know how to do this whole microtransaction game within a game thing.

654
00:43:57,374 --> 00:43:59,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what Microsoft has planned for Game Room long term now.

655
00:43:59,696 --> 00:44:02,419
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, they might just sweep it under the rug like they've been doing a lot of stuff.

656
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:06,501
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they plan on keeping that going, I would love to see it go over there.

657
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:12,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I think that studio probably has no interest in anything but pinball, but you never know.

658
00:44:12,503 --> 00:44:13,424
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really it.

659
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:15,565
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it for my gaming week.

660
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have anything else to say on that, so let's get into housekeeping tonight.

661
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:23,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Join our Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

662
00:44:23,654 --> 00:44:26,135
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR.

663
00:44:26,715 --> 00:44:29,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have a MySpace, but really, who uses MySpace anymore?

664
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Is anyone on MySpace?

665
00:44:31,238 --> 00:44:31,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Any MySpace fans?

666
00:44:31,978 --> 00:44:32,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't think so.

667
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:34,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some gaming news.

668
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,841
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start off tonight with Loki.

669
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:39,102
[SPEAKER_05]: We're only, what, 50 minutes into the show, finally getting to gaming news?

670
00:44:39,162 --> 00:44:40,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally on MySpace.

671
00:44:41,283 --> 00:44:43,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding, I'm not on MySpace, because no one uses it.

672
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:48,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I think anyone who's on Myspace just never deleted their profile two years ago.

673
00:44:49,071 --> 00:44:49,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

674
00:44:50,674 --> 00:44:54,719
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually some pretty interesting stuff going on.

675
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Gran Turismo 5.

676
00:44:57,123 --> 00:44:59,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's supposed to be out this week, right?

677
00:44:59,886 --> 00:45:00,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

678
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:01,352
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

679
00:45:01,853 --> 00:45:02,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

680
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:06,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't end up coming out this week, and it's been delayed again.

681
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:19,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they haven't really said when it's supposed to be coming out, other than just a few different comments based off of the producers of the game and what retailers are saying.

682
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:24,612
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the creator, Yamauchi,

683
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:36,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it was telling the website, Japolik, that the discs were being stamped as we speak.

684
00:45:37,197 --> 00:45:43,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I can tell you right now is bullshit, that the game has not gone gold, and I don't believe it's being stamped right now.

685
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:54,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, apparently retailers are listing that the game is going to have a past Christmas release date.

686
00:45:55,793 --> 00:46:01,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are showing a 1-1 release date or December 31st, which I can tell you right now is just a temporary date.

687
00:46:02,663 --> 00:46:03,424
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

688
00:46:24,642 --> 00:46:25,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Just gotta wait longer.

689
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:30,405
[SPEAKER_05]: The more this is going on, the more I'm kind of like forgetting about this game.

690
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:31,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

691
00:46:32,286 --> 00:46:32,807
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

692
00:46:32,827 --> 00:46:35,748
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of sad because Gran Turismo is like a huge franchise and everything.

693
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:38,810
[SPEAKER_05]: But the more this is going on, I'm just kind of like, oh, there's all this other stuff.

694
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:43,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when Gran Turismo 5 Prologue came out and it was supposed to be a taste of what the game was like?

695
00:46:43,373 --> 00:46:46,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's not even close to what the game is like?

696
00:46:46,494 --> 00:46:47,075
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

697
00:46:47,595 --> 00:46:53,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when they had, was it Gran Turismo 5, like, what was it?

698
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like Concept or something like that.

699
00:46:55,682 --> 00:47:00,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the free download that was on the PlayStation Network.

700
00:47:01,046 --> 00:47:01,727
[SPEAKER_05]: It was ridiculous.

701
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:10,635
[SPEAKER_05]: SatelliteMinded says in our chatroom at chat.ownershuntradio.com, do Gran Theft, or sorry, I was going to say Gran Theft, Gran Turismo 5 delays count as news anymore?

702
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:10,695
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

703
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:19,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in this case, yes, because they're missing the holiday season, if this is all true, which is pretty damaging.

704
00:47:19,642 --> 00:47:21,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is and it isn't.

705
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:26,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've shown through this last year that games can do very well, even if released after the holidays.

706
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:30,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point, Mass Effect 2 came out, what, like a week after the holidays?

707
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:32,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And it did fine.

708
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:38,339
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, to miss that holiday season, especially with such an epic, epic game, I think is newsworthy.

709
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,821
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

710
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:00,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

711
00:48:00,518 --> 00:48:00,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

712
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Blowing my mind.

713
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have to take a day off work for that one.

714
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:04,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

715
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:05,962
[SPEAKER_05]: That big a deal?

716
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:06,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.

717
00:48:06,523 --> 00:48:08,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think I'm taking a day off for Cataclysm.

718
00:48:10,165 --> 00:48:10,446
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

719
00:48:10,906 --> 00:48:13,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, going to other Sony news.

720
00:48:13,948 --> 00:48:16,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that the Tester 2 started this week?

721
00:48:18,153 --> 00:48:43,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, and don't care The Tester 2, of course, you know, this is the sequel to The Tester 1 Which is Sony's original programming for PlayStation Network And, you know, it's been getting its share of crap And, you know, even though I myself am hazing The Tester 2 here on the show It's not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be It's just no better than, like, an average Bravo reality television show

722
00:48:45,185 --> 00:48:47,487
[SPEAKER_05]: But is that as far as Sony wants to go?

723
00:48:48,088 --> 00:49:10,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly not, if you were to believe PlayStation Network director Susan Panico They want to go all the way That's right, she wants to go all the way Saying, quote, I hope five years from now we'll be winning Emmys for quality shows No, I'm sorry No one wins Emmys for reality shows It starts with a dream It starts with a dream, Loki

724
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:11,714
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

725
00:49:35,603 --> 00:49:41,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I will give them props to the fact that they are also a movie production house.

726
00:49:42,266 --> 00:49:50,889
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the resources, I just don't see the tester as a good example of what can be done with those resources.

727
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:52,570
[SPEAKER_05]: It all starts with a dream.

728
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:53,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

729
00:50:10,328 --> 00:50:11,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

730
00:50:39,192 --> 00:50:43,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Spastinator PSN in our chatroom says, there's only one good thing about the tester too, Adrian Curry.

731
00:50:43,895 --> 00:50:44,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Need I say more?

732
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:45,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

733
00:50:45,196 --> 00:50:45,656
[SPEAKER_05]: She's in that?

734
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:46,617
[SPEAKER_05]: She is a hot mess.

735
00:50:47,137 --> 00:50:49,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that might make it actually worth watching.

736
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:49,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she's a judge.

737
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:50,579
[SPEAKER_05]: That bitch is a mess.

738
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they don't have Hal Sparks this year or something?

739
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:54,282
[SPEAKER_05]: They have her instead?

740
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:55,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

741
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:56,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

742
00:50:56,243 --> 00:51:00,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that, oh man, she is, let's just say she was very pro Prop 19.

743
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:02,127
[SPEAKER_05]: She was very sad, I'm sure.

744
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:02,747
[SPEAKER_05]: That didn't pass.

745
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:03,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

746
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:09,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Satellite Minded says Sony will win an Emmy for PSN shows when GT5 comes out.

747
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I'm sure now she won't be able to do pot.

748
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:14,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was the only thing stopping her.

749
00:51:14,592 --> 00:51:14,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

750
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:19,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That no vote really stopped everyone, I'm sure, California.

751
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:19,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Way to go.

752
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:21,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

753
00:51:21,853 --> 00:51:27,520
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're right, though, that Sony has the studio behind it to make this work if they want to.

754
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:33,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that this I don't really see as the real motivator to get things going.

755
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:36,269
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we'll see what happens.

756
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,794
[SPEAKER_05]: What Sony should do is take some of the pilots that maybe don't work out very well or better yet.

757
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:42,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a great idea, Sony.

758
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:47,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Take shows that get cancelled before their prime.

759
00:51:48,492 --> 00:51:50,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want an example of this, just go to Fox.

760
00:51:51,014 --> 00:51:53,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Fox always loves to cancel things before their prime.

761
00:51:54,035 --> 00:51:57,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And get the rest of the episodes and put them up on PSN.

762
00:51:57,998 --> 00:52:03,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially, like, can you imagine if something like PlayStation Store had been around when Firefly was on TV?

763
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:04,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, hear me out.

764
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:07,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I know there's Whedon nerds that listen to this show.

765
00:52:08,263 --> 00:52:35,142
[SPEAKER_05]: so imagine like Fox cancels Firefly but Sony is smart enough to know oh there was actually this really strong cult audience for the show somebody's already paid to make this show let's just buy the rights to put them on PlayStation Network and have it be ad supported and then that would just draw you know and then maybe it finally finds its audience in this on-demand network like that could be huge now I don't think Firefly was a Sony studio show I think I don't know Universal or yeah but

766
00:52:35,502 --> 00:53:03,192
[SPEAKER_04]: but anyway just take that idea and apply it to maybe a really good show that Sony might have had or here's an idea since you've got you know you like doing television programming and stuff like that make your own IPTV channels you know actually have some different channels of content on there that are exclusive to the PlayStation Network and say maybe you have to pay a $5 a month fee to access this stuff that would be kind of neat you know oh so Hulu

767
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,350
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not necessarily.

768
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:07,991
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an on-demand type thing.

769
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:14,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about actual content that's like a live network where you can tune in at a certain time and watch something.

770
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:19,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Not, oh hey, I want to watch old episodes of this and go.

771
00:53:20,973 --> 00:53:24,615
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we'll see what happens with Sony programming later on.

772
00:53:24,675 --> 00:53:26,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll announce an expansion at E3.

773
00:53:26,795 --> 00:53:27,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

774
00:53:28,156 --> 00:53:34,459
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would expect that Xbox is going to announce a success for the 1 versus 100 first.

775
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:35,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, they did.

776
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think it came up anywhere on our show roll tonight.

777
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear about this?

778
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Just quickly, I've got to throw this out there.

779
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:46,984
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new game coming out for Xbox that is that whole 1 versus 100-esque type of thing, the massively multiplayer game.

780
00:53:47,744 --> 00:53:57,229
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a poker game which I'm kind of like sick of poker games too many of them does he really?

781
00:53:58,129 --> 00:54:15,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean there's an audience for it it's an easy game to learn it'll have an audience I'll try it once not interested unless it's strip poker and even then I probably wouldn't be interested and now with Kinect that's possible Kinect poker now you can Kinect in a whole new way DarkSakura what do you have for us?

782
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:20,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have something regarding Apple.

783
00:54:20,545 --> 00:54:26,347
[SPEAKER_02]: They have filed a patent that looks like it's going to be an augmented reality game.

784
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:35,090
[SPEAKER_02]: It has something on there for targeting and using a real-world interactive game environment.

785
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, from what it looks like on here, it's going to be so you can shoot people.

786
00:54:40,532 --> 00:54:41,132
[SPEAKER_04]: In the face.

787
00:54:42,438 --> 00:54:49,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it even has a mention of a gun attachment for it.

788
00:54:51,202 --> 00:54:52,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know what they're doing.

789
00:54:52,782 --> 00:55:02,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it could be maybe laser tag, or it could be that they're just filing it so that no one else does it, or it could be, you know, a money shot game.

790
00:55:03,948 --> 00:55:13,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just can't help but think of that thing we played on the show a couple weeks ago from The Onion that was just the shoot people in the face over and over game and then it was like cute furry animals too.

791
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:19,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this won't be controversial at all if you can shoot your friends in the face.

792
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:23,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it can be like Ink Blaster.

793
00:55:24,414 --> 00:55:25,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right, red ink.

794
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:28,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, red ink.

795
00:55:28,856 --> 00:55:29,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You got red on you.

796
00:55:29,856 --> 00:55:31,916
[SPEAKER_05]: They could also just be patenting this so no one else can.

797
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:33,457
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my thought was.

798
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:33,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

799
00:55:36,388 --> 00:55:39,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that's all I got to say on that.

800
00:55:39,392 --> 00:55:40,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So, other interesting things.

801
00:55:41,834 --> 00:55:53,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, with the new dashboard, and this is totally not unexpected, they are actually going to be implementing new features to try to stop piracy.

802
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:55,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Unhackable.

803
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

804
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me guess.

805
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:03,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Some mucky muck up there came out and said that you can't pirate on this thing.

806
00:56:05,372 --> 00:56:06,952
[SPEAKER_05]: We have made this hack-proof.

807
00:56:07,252 --> 00:56:17,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone said anything about it, but basically they have a new series of checks that they do for disks, which I guess hackers are referring to as AP 2.5.

808
00:56:19,555 --> 00:56:23,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that work in conjunction with security sectors embedded in the disk.

809
00:56:23,399 --> 00:56:30,184
[SPEAKER_04]: If the checks come back negative, the player receives a dirty disk error, and his or her console is flagged for permaban.

810
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:45,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It says pirates, though, can hypothetically avoid these checks by not updating to the new firmware, and though this will prevent them from playing on Xbox Live, which kind of defeats the purpose of avoiding the permaban, it

811
00:56:47,395 --> 00:57:04,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, apparently, one, if you're burning a copy of the game anyways, you could just delete the update on it, so that would bypass that, because not all games that have the new firmware attached with them actually require that firmware to run.

812
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:13,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, if you have a JTAG console, you can just plain delete the update anyways, and that way you can avoid actually...

813
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:18,339
[SPEAKER_04]: you know having to update your system of course well if you have a JTAG you can't update it anyways

814
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:24,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look, Microsoft has a right to protect their assets, and I get that and everything, but are they bragging about it?

815
00:57:24,431 --> 00:57:25,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they come out and say?

816
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:25,852
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

817
00:57:26,432 --> 00:57:27,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Digital Foundry did.

818
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:31,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then, you know, it's to be expected in this case.

819
00:57:32,237 --> 00:57:40,664
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that gets me is when they come out and say, oh, well, this system, we put measures in this to make this unhackable, and it's going to do this and this.

820
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:44,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just an open invitation for people to say, please hack me.

821
00:57:44,947 --> 00:57:45,808
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

822
00:58:07,532 --> 00:58:09,033
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they can get past all those checks.

823
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:10,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And replacement drives are only about $20.

824
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:12,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's a lot of work.

825
00:58:12,754 --> 00:58:15,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a lot of work for someone that's really determined.

826
00:58:15,235 --> 00:58:17,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but how many people are that determined?

827
00:58:17,776 --> 00:58:18,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

828
00:58:18,076 --> 00:58:21,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I've spoofed a drive before because I've messed up flashing a firmware on there.

829
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:23,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really simple to do.

830
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:30,481
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, you'd really have to want to play burn games.

831
00:58:32,002 --> 00:58:32,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

832
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:38,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I'm sure we're going to continue to hear news like this as more of these firmware updates come out.

833
00:58:38,492 --> 00:58:41,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really no surprise that half the time new firmware updates are too dressed.

834
00:58:41,975 --> 00:58:43,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a back and forth.

835
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:49,122
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll figure out a way around it and they'll come out with something new and they'll figure out a way around that and so on and so forth.

836
00:58:50,002 --> 00:58:57,407
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, let's move on to something a little different, and this has to do with the iPhone slash iTouch slash iPad, the iOS family of games.

837
00:58:57,848 --> 00:59:00,369
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a brand new service from Capcom out there.

838
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:03,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a free-to-play iPhone arcade app.

839
00:59:03,371 --> 00:59:04,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Capcom Arcade.

840
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:09,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It is free, and you can play Street Fighter II, Commando, Ghouls N' Ghosts in 1942.

841
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:12,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, ah, but here's the catch.

842
00:59:13,118 --> 00:59:21,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like Game Room in the sense where you can get tokens to play games for 99 cents or you can pay three bucks for unlimited access.

843
00:59:22,505 --> 00:59:26,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, here's the best part, you get three free plays per day.

844
00:59:27,548 --> 00:59:31,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you just want to download and play three times a day, free!

845
00:59:32,071 --> 00:59:33,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, go get it.

846
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:35,273
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the subbie from just changing the date on your phone?

847
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:37,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

848
00:59:38,485 --> 00:59:41,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not that desperate to play more Street Fighter 2.

849
00:59:41,626 --> 00:59:45,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I played that game until my fingers were bleeding back when I was like 12.

850
00:59:46,909 --> 00:59:53,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll play it once and I'll go, hee hee, this sure controls like ass on my iPhone, but it was fun to try.

851
00:59:53,651 --> 00:59:55,552
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what it's going to be.

852
00:59:56,513 --> 01:00:00,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Because let's not forget, they make terrible controllers.

853
01:00:01,855 --> 01:00:06,717
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one thing that's really stopping iOS from moving on is the lack of something tangible right now.

854
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:08,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

855
01:00:09,361 --> 01:00:12,182
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, I'm all about free, even if it's just three times a day.

856
01:00:12,382 --> 01:00:15,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get as much of that out as I can.

857
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:16,204
[SPEAKER_05]: But where's Quiz and Dragons?

858
01:00:17,305 --> 01:00:18,125
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm waiting for.

859
01:00:21,387 --> 01:00:22,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep room for updates.

860
01:00:24,468 --> 01:00:25,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

861
01:00:25,129 --> 01:00:26,409
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

862
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:27,970
[SPEAKER_05]: We have release dates coming up right after this.

863
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic Game of the Week, not that far away.

864
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:39,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this sounds really cool and something I'm actually thinking about participating in is that Capcom's forum has these contest rules.

865
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:47,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, until November 22nd, you can do your own artwork for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and if it basically wins...

866
01:00:48,426 --> 01:00:54,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get an Xbox 360 and a couple of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and a framed print of your own work.

867
01:00:55,728 --> 01:00:56,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure it's not dirty.

868
01:00:57,729 --> 01:01:03,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And your work gets to actually be in the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 art book.

869
01:01:04,691 --> 01:01:05,331
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

870
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:10,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think that my stuff is all that fantastic, but it'd still be fun to participate.

871
01:01:12,793 --> 01:01:15,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess if you have artistic talent, which won't be me.

872
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:20,894
[SPEAKER_05]: When they do the voice actor thing, then I'll try, but for now...

873
01:01:26,718 --> 01:01:27,639
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

874
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:50,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC

875
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:06,893
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a version for the Wii, but really isn't anyone going to play it.

876
01:02:07,153 --> 01:02:07,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And DS.

877
01:02:09,996 --> 01:02:16,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sure DS sells a lot of Call of Duty Black Ops.

878
01:02:17,202 --> 01:02:19,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Other fun things coming out this week, of course.

879
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:25,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's more Kinect games.

880
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:28,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yay, more?

881
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:29,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, more.

882
01:02:29,772 --> 01:02:30,793
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually...

883
01:02:32,845 --> 01:02:33,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see here.

884
01:02:34,907 --> 01:02:36,508
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hate the new site that they have here.

885
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, you could always prep these things in advance.

886
01:02:43,353 --> 01:02:43,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course not.

887
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

888
01:02:45,574 --> 01:02:46,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

889
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:51,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about other things that are not necessarily Kinect games, because there's a lot of those, too.

890
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:53,500
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to mention all of them, because everybody wants to know.

891
01:02:54,741 --> 01:02:54,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

892
01:02:56,062 --> 01:03:00,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuck E. Cheese's Playhouse, a crappy game for kids, and that's on Nintendo DS.

893
01:03:00,885 --> 01:03:03,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Noah's Ark, also on the Nintendo DS.

894
01:03:03,466 --> 01:03:05,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuck E. Cheese's Game Room on Nintendo DS.

895
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:08,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Nickelodeon Fit on the Wii.

896
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:10,249
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really for little kids.

897
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, that's right, the one that's claymation that they have each year.

898
01:03:15,432 --> 01:03:16,753
[SPEAKER_04]: They based the game off that.

899
01:03:16,933 --> 01:03:18,134
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on the Wii and DS.

900
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:22,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Family Feud, decades coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

901
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,798
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell is Family Feud Decades?

902
01:03:24,898 --> 01:03:28,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like where you get Richard Dawson from the 70s?

903
01:03:28,281 --> 01:03:29,162
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

904
01:03:29,342 --> 01:03:30,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray Combs from the 80s?

905
01:03:30,143 --> 01:03:31,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much simpler than that.

906
01:03:31,324 --> 01:03:36,108
[SPEAKER_04]: You have families dressed up like different cliches of decades.

907
01:03:36,169 --> 01:03:38,791
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the cheapest cash-in I have ever heard in my life.

908
01:03:40,932 --> 01:04:02,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster Jam Path of Destruction on the Wii DS, Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and they actually do have bundles that include a steering wheel even one for the Playstation 3 but not for the move you'd be surprised to find out it's actually for the stupid DualShock 3 because I guess the game uses 6 axis steering

909
01:04:03,437 --> 01:04:04,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Dance Kids.

910
01:04:05,217 --> 01:04:07,178
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also another game for little kids.

911
01:04:07,378 --> 01:04:14,540
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Just Dance with the wheels on the bus go round and round and other things like music from the Wiggles and whatnot.

912
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:19,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely not something that our age demographic of listeners would be interested in.

913
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:21,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Karaoke Revolution Glee.

914
01:04:22,821 --> 01:04:24,322
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a bundle coming out on the Wii.

915
01:04:24,382 --> 01:04:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: This game gives me nightmares.

916
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:29,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

917
01:04:29,893 --> 01:04:31,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Honda Fever.

918
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:36,000
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically just a repackage of another game that came out that sucked.

919
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:39,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyblade Metal Fusion.

920
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:46,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this is actually a series that's still on TV, but they have that game coming out on the Nintendo DS and the Wii.

921
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:51,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I guess Monster Jam Path of Destruction came out on PSP as well.

922
01:04:51,963 --> 01:04:54,406
[SPEAKER_04]: This has got to be the worst game I've ever seen.

923
01:04:55,167 --> 01:04:57,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Reload Target Down for the Nintendo Wii.

924
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:00,353
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a game where you test fire guns.

925
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:01,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

926
01:05:01,915 --> 01:05:02,536
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game.

927
01:05:02,836 --> 01:05:04,118
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't shoot people.

928
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,421
[SPEAKER_04]: You target shoot with guns.

929
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:12,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Style Lab Fashion Design Hasbro Family Game Night Challenge Me Brain Puzzles 2 Nintendo DS

930
01:05:27,765 --> 01:05:31,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Remington Super Slam Hunting North America on the Wii.

931
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:35,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's see here.

932
01:05:35,171 --> 01:05:38,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Remington Super Slam Hunting Africa on the Wii.

933
01:05:39,274 --> 01:05:43,538
[SPEAKER_04]: My Sims Collection with both My Sims Racing and I believe just My Sims.

934
01:05:44,618 --> 01:05:47,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 on the Wii finally coming out now.

935
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:53,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Rune Factory 3 of A Fantasy Harvest Moon on the Nintendo DS.

936
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:53,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

937
01:05:54,806 --> 01:05:57,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently they're doing an ESA game pack.

938
01:05:57,307 --> 01:05:59,547
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that they do every year.

939
01:06:00,047 --> 01:06:04,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually a certain game manufacturer will actually put out a collection of stuff.

940
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:21,813
[SPEAKER_04]: This one comes with Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, Tomb Raider, and Mercenaries 2 for $29.99 and all the proceeds I believe go to charity for that to the ESA if you want to support that and some really old ass games.

941
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:28,295
[SPEAKER_04]: SingStar Dance, a very terrible add-on to the SingStar series.

942
01:06:28,755 --> 01:06:29,896
[SPEAKER_04]: That is on the PlayStation 3.

943
01:06:29,936 --> 01:06:32,937
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fight lights out.

944
01:06:33,077 --> 01:06:34,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, do not buy this game.

945
01:06:34,878 --> 01:06:35,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.

946
01:06:35,798 --> 01:06:37,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got horrible reviews.

947
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:38,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Really do not need this game.

948
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,120
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sly Collection, that's coming out on PlayStation 3.

949
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:48,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a recreation of, or I guess, HD versions of the old Sly Cooper games, and the third one's actually in 3D as well.

950
01:06:50,643 --> 01:06:51,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.

951
01:06:51,604 --> 01:06:54,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, there's a ton of crap coming out.

952
01:06:55,006 --> 01:06:57,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Digging for Dinosaur on Nintendo DS.

953
01:06:57,668 --> 01:06:59,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Zuzu Pets has some more games coming out.

954
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:01,630
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kungzoo on Nintendo DS.

955
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:05,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to skip past a bunch of this crap.

956
01:07:05,913 --> 01:07:08,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Harvest Moon is being re-released on Nintendo DS.

957
01:07:09,495 --> 01:07:09,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

958
01:07:10,315 --> 01:07:15,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, same with... They're doing a lot of re-releases on stuff.

959
01:07:15,138 --> 01:07:16,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Rune Factory 2 is coming out.

960
01:07:16,419 --> 01:07:17,299
[SPEAKER_04]: They're re-releasing that.

961
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's probably a price drop.

962
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with the first one.

963
01:07:20,282 --> 01:07:21,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Releasing all that stuff.

964
01:07:21,843 --> 01:07:29,112
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Xbox controller with that wonderful fixed D-pad is now coming out this week for $65 if you really want to buy that.

965
01:07:30,678 --> 01:07:58,287
[SPEAKER_04]: and then a few things one week from today Mario vs. Donkey Kong Miniland Mayhem coming out on Nintendo DS and then also one week from today will be the potential for a new Mario Paint U-Draw tablet with U-Draw Studios will be coming out and then of course the two games that go along with that Dude's Big Adventure and Pictionary and of course that's that tablet thing that looked like the Mario Paint type pen tablet thing

966
01:07:58,928 --> 01:08:01,296
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course Pictionary is also on Nintendo DS.

967
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:01,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

968
01:08:03,544 --> 01:08:04,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, jeez.

969
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, there's a lot of crap going on.

970
01:08:05,626 --> 01:08:06,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, no, I know it's holidays.

971
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:07,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And emphasis on crap.

972
01:08:08,388 --> 01:08:09,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to Japan and see what's coming out over there.

973
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,513
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Xbox 360, Forza Motorsport 3 on November 11th.

974
01:08:13,633 --> 01:08:14,814
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Ultimate Edition, by the way.

975
01:08:15,555 --> 01:08:20,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Mushihima-sama Futari Version 1.5 is the Platinum Collection.

976
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:21,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you want this so bad?

977
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:22,861
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a shooter game, isn't it?

978
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:24,302
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, and it's a really cool shooter.

979
01:08:25,543 --> 01:08:28,005

983
01:08:36,815 --> 01:08:37,296
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I say?

984
01:08:37,616 --> 01:08:37,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Scared.

985
01:08:38,337 --> 01:08:38,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my bad.

986
01:08:38,957 --> 01:08:39,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Sacred 2.

987
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I like a game called Scared 2.

988
01:08:42,962 --> 01:08:43,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Scared 2.

989
01:08:45,244 --> 01:08:48,348
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 has Biohazard 5 Alternative Edition.

990
01:08:48,388 --> 01:08:49,970
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be Resident Evil 5 with the move.

[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2, Mafia 2, Scared 2, Fallen Angel, Shinsengoku Musou Online, Soten Ranbu comes out this week as well on the PlayStation 3.

993
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:13,784
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like seven of those games.

994
01:09:13,804 --> 01:09:14,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Dynasty Warriors, is that it?

995
01:09:15,265 --> 01:09:16,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that, but online.

996
01:09:17,026 --> 01:09:17,627
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the one?

997
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Dice Wars Online.

01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:22,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to other systems.

1000
01:09:22,952 --> 01:09:27,175
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Nintendo Wii in Japan this week on the 11th.

1001
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:32,520
[SPEAKER_05]: The 25th anniversary Mario game comes out over there, as well as the Nintendo Wii in some different colors.

[SPEAKER_05]: Something called the Party Game Box 100.

[SPEAKER_05]: Jinsei Game, Happy Family gets a release as well.

1009
01:09:49,492 --> 01:09:51,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of things that we don't care about.

1010
01:09:52,013 --> 01:09:58,136
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 2 gets one game this week called Shinkyoku Sokai Polyphonica After School.

1011
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:00,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only guess what this game is going to be about.

1012
01:10:01,017 --> 01:10:01,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you a hint.

1013
01:10:01,737 --> 01:10:04,259
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a girl in a school outfit on the cover.

1014
01:10:04,839 --> 01:10:05,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Porn?

1017
01:10:47,999 --> 01:11:04,081
[SPEAKER_05]: and it actually is not that although it looks like this game stars plenty of bukkake people that you'd probably want to see in a bukkake porn I'm just kidding they're kids that's gross alright what's wrong with you what's wrong with you how about it

1018
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:25,566

[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1021
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:38,294
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm going to say anyway.

1022
01:11:39,975 --> 01:11:41,636
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I like how you filter the crap out.

1023
01:11:42,897 --> 01:11:45,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're talking about.

1024
01:11:47,739 --> 01:11:48,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just messing with you.

1025
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1026
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,361
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more stories in the Classic Game of the Week.

1027
01:11:54,382 --> 01:11:55,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to filter all the crap out.

1028
01:11:56,143 --> 01:11:58,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just mention one game the next time.

1029
01:11:58,143 --> 01:11:58,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

1030
01:11:58,784 --> 01:12:02,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, this week only comes out when we're going to filter all the crap.

1031
01:12:02,245 --> 01:12:03,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Chuck E. Cheese.

1032
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:04,486
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the only game coming out this week.

1033
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:14,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Xbox Live Indie Games has disappeared off the main marketplace menu and you actually have to dig for it now.

1034
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in specialty shops.

1035
01:12:16,371 --> 01:12:18,472
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, it's not that hard to find, you guys.

1036
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:19,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1037
01:12:19,653 --> 01:12:23,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a couple menus deep, but it's not impossible to find.

1038
01:12:23,876 --> 01:12:25,237
[SPEAKER_05]: But I understand why people are pissed.

1039
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:25,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'll shut up.

1040
01:12:25,977 --> 01:12:29,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it is now under Specialty Shops.

1041
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Avatar Marketplace being the first spot on there.

1042
01:12:33,002 --> 01:12:34,763
[SPEAKER_04]: But Indie Games is a close second.

1043
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:46,171
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, Xbox Live Indie Game Creators are bummed over the fact that the menu has been slightly hidden, if you will.

1044
01:12:46,852 --> 01:12:59,010
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know it's just they kind of feel like they're being brushed off I guess I don't think it's that big a deal to be honest

1045
01:13:00,205 --> 01:13:01,526
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1046
01:13:18,522 --> 01:13:19,023
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1047
01:13:37,601 --> 01:13:45,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine if they had something like Windows Media Player with a store in it where it wasn't just the music and movies, but things that you could download to your Xbox.

1048
01:13:45,544 --> 01:13:49,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe like when you download a movie, it would download to your PC and your Xbox.

1049
01:13:50,685 --> 01:13:55,027
[SPEAKER_05]: But within that, they could do like this whole indie games thing, kind of like iTunes does.

1050
01:13:55,087 --> 01:13:55,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know.

1051
01:13:56,547 --> 01:13:58,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I could kind of see that being kind of neat.

1052
01:13:59,168 --> 01:13:59,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1053
01:14:01,368 --> 01:14:02,008
[SPEAKER_05]: at the same time.

1054
01:14:02,828 --> 01:14:03,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's too much work.

1055
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:05,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they're trying to sell this whole Kinect thing.

1056
01:14:05,849 --> 01:14:08,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And they haven't opened up Kinect to indie developers yet, have they?

1057
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably won't for a long time.

1058
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:12,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember if they have or not.

1059
01:14:12,831 --> 01:14:18,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe Xbox Live Arcade, but not, I don't know.

1060
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:20,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Ross Steel UT is in our chat room.

1061
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:20,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really?

1062
01:14:21,014 --> 01:14:22,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Ross Steel UT, I haven't seen him in like two years.

1063
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:26,215
[SPEAKER_05]: The indie games aren't any less easy to find than they were before.

1064
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:27,236
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just butthurt.

1065
01:14:27,876 --> 01:14:28,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

1066
01:14:29,986 --> 01:14:58,287
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah I mean I didn't find them particularly hard to find and I think again if you sell yourself on the web you'll be fine I can understand though where the developers are feeling a little bit unloved but keep in mind there's a lot of things at Microsoft right now being unloved Game Room's another one everything's all about the Kinect Kinect Kinect Kinect Kinect Kinect maybe after the holidays they can focus on that other stuff again but we'll see although I somehow wouldn't be holding my breath

1067
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Something you know is inevitable, though, and is going to happen is a Bejeweled 3.

1068
01:15:04,643 --> 01:15:09,185
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, Bejeweled 1 and Bejeweled 2 are some of the biggest freaking games ever made.

1069
01:15:09,566 --> 01:15:12,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Bejeweled 3 is coming out on December 7th.

1070
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:13,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And my wife didn't care.

1071
01:15:14,268 --> 01:15:14,549
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1072
01:15:15,169 --> 01:15:16,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Bejeweled was the only game she plays.

1073
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:18,251
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, what are they going to add to it?

1074
01:15:18,271 --> 01:15:20,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, they have this new poker mode thing.

1075
01:15:20,592 --> 01:15:21,333
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, that's dumb.

1076
01:15:21,989 --> 01:15:23,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wait until she tries.

1077
01:15:23,349 --> 01:15:36,972
[SPEAKER_05]: There are also, just so you know, new Quest and Zen modes are coming to the game, unlockable secret game variants, and there's also supposed to be smoother gameplay and new music and sound.

1078
01:15:36,992 --> 01:15:49,934
[SPEAKER_05]: $20 if you want to get it through PopCap.com, but I bet you'll have to wait not even six months and it'll be out on iPhone and Xbox Live and PlayStation Network and pretty much anything with a controller or touchscreen.

1079
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:50,934
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have Bejeweled 3.

1080
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:52,735
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1081
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:30,256
[SPEAKER_05]: by the way, Zuma Blitz is supposed to be coming out very soon as well too I think that's in beta right now so lots of new games coming out of Pop Crack what about Plants vs. Zombie Blitz?

1082
01:16:31,436 --> 01:16:43,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I shouldn't hold my breath on that one hey, it's the time of the show where we take a stroll down memory lane and allow Dark Sakura to take the reins for a little bit oh, we must be crazy

1083
01:16:44,286 --> 01:16:47,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1084
01:17:09,986 --> 01:17:14,492
[SPEAKER_02]: The classic game of the week is Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Superheroes.

1085
01:17:14,972 --> 01:17:17,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, ah.

1086
01:17:17,636 --> 01:17:22,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I got a big excited girl boner for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 today.

1087
01:17:22,742 --> 01:17:23,643
[SPEAKER_05]: A bit of Ladywood.

1088
01:17:24,144 --> 01:17:24,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1089
01:17:24,885 --> 01:17:27,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to start off with the characters that came out of it.

1090
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,352
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my favorite music in the game, for the record.

1091
01:17:35,215 --> 01:17:42,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, the game is the fifth of the Marvel Comics licensed fighting games.

1092
01:17:43,782 --> 01:17:51,189
[SPEAKER_02]: This one actually, instead of being just an X-Men vs. or Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, this goes all over the place.

1093
01:17:52,389 --> 01:18:01,875
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have to basically get all of these people against Onslaught who I thought was actually kind of a retarded character in the comics but that's just me.

1094
01:18:02,616 --> 01:18:18,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving forward we have this one is where you actually have a random assist character that you start off with bringing one of your teammates in which I think they've gotten rid of for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and

1095
01:18:22,196 --> 01:18:26,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, there were also ways that you could select who your little bonus person was.

1096
01:18:27,422 --> 01:18:30,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also had duo team attacks.

1097
01:18:30,726 --> 01:18:31,907
[SPEAKER_02]: This music is awesome, too.

1098
01:18:32,848 --> 01:18:33,809
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the theme of Strider 3.

1099
01:18:39,201 --> 01:18:41,462
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so far.

1100
01:18:41,942 --> 01:18:42,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet.

1101
01:18:43,203 --> 01:18:43,583
[SPEAKER_02]: So far.

1102
01:18:43,663 --> 01:18:44,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I said so far.

1103
01:18:44,624 --> 01:18:45,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was.

1104
01:18:45,404 --> 01:18:46,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, why not?

1105
01:18:47,085 --> 01:18:48,946
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, not yet.

1106
01:18:49,486 --> 01:19:04,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, the different characters in this one is you had Spider-Man, Captain America, Hulk, Wolverine, Venom, Gambit, War Machine, Gold War Machine, Red Venom, Orange Hulk, and Onslaught on the Marvel side.

1107
01:19:05,614 --> 01:19:15,381
[SPEAKER_02]: and on Capcom you had Ryu Chun-Li, Zangief, Mega Man, Jin, Morrigan, Strider Hero, Captain Commando, Roll.

1108
01:19:16,221 --> 01:19:17,382
[SPEAKER_02]: You should play Roll's music now.

1109
01:19:18,683 --> 01:19:20,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Lilith or Shadow Lady.

1110
01:19:20,984 --> 01:19:23,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Roll had singy-songy music.

1111
01:19:26,488 --> 01:19:26,828
[SPEAKER_02]: As in his...

1112
01:19:36,735 --> 01:19:56,041
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as your special partners, you've got Unknown Soldier, Lu and Siva, Saki Omokane, Pure and Fur, Psylocke, Michelle Hart, Iceman, Arthur, Tonpoo, Juggernaut, Devilot, Thor, Magneto, US Agent, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Anita, Jubilee, Rogue, Shadow, and Sentinel.

1113
01:19:57,762 --> 01:19:58,862
[SPEAKER_02]: At least gave the nods over.

1114
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:00,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Tonpoo, that was just cool.

1115
01:20:00,943 --> 01:20:01,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I laughed.

1116
01:20:02,043 --> 01:20:12,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at any rate, there is a perfect version that came out on Dreamcast in 1999, and it had cross-fever mode, so you could have four players play simultaneously.

1117
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:17,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was a version that came out on the PlayStation, which is the EX edition in Japan.

1118
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:45,903
[SPEAKER_02]: but it didn't have the tag team gameplay and it didn't have the secondary characters except just for assists but it did have the crossover you could play a tag team with identical teams which was kind of stupid but it did allow you to play as Onslaught and if you beat the game with well that's I think if you beat the game with Mega Man or something

1119
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:50,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the soundtrack came out, which I've got the soundtrack, and it is amazing.

1120
01:20:51,891 --> 01:20:55,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great, and it opened the door for all this other funness.

1121
01:20:57,894 --> 01:21:02,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Dan got me hooked on playing with Strider New Year.

1122
01:21:03,056 --> 01:21:03,956
[SPEAKER_02]: This is other good music.

1123
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone should recognize that.

1124
01:21:11,522 --> 01:21:12,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, the theme of Mega Man.

1125
01:21:13,504 --> 01:21:15,406
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.

1126
01:21:15,806 --> 01:21:17,007
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great game.

1127
01:21:18,088 --> 01:21:21,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely one worth having on the Dreamcast because it was perfect.

1128
01:21:22,933 --> 01:21:24,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is really good.

1129
01:21:24,234 --> 01:21:30,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to Marvel vs. Capcom 3, but I had to start it with somewhere and I think this is a good place to do it.

1130
01:21:31,582 --> 01:21:32,623
[SPEAKER_05]: It's as good of a place as any.

1131
01:21:33,043 --> 01:21:33,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so that's it.

1132
01:21:34,004 --> 01:21:35,045
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your classic game of the week.

1133
01:21:35,499 --> 01:21:40,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Marvel vs. Capcom 1.

1134
01:21:41,444 --> 01:21:47,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Back before, there was all these other sequels, and now this new fancy one.

1135
01:21:47,928 --> 01:22:00,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I gotta say, the videos I was looking at online for the new one, and even seeing it at E3, although it looks like it's come a long way, just even in the videos I've been seeing online, pretty awesome, gotta say.

1136
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:01,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking forward to it.

1137
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:03,344
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to take a break.

1138
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:04,685
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back, though, guys.

1139
01:22:04,725 --> 01:22:05,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned.

1140
01:22:05,626 --> 01:22:07,527
[SPEAKER_05]: We have plenty more show to come.

1141
01:22:07,567 --> 01:22:10,670
[SPEAKER_05]: We got our rapid-fire news, of which there's a lot, since we have to make up for last week.

1142
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:13,933
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also going to talk a little more about that whole Kinect hacking stuff.

1143
01:22:13,953 --> 01:22:15,374
[SPEAKER_05]: We have another story on that coming up in a minute.

1144
01:22:15,694 --> 01:22:20,678
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about Fable 3 and Saints Row as well on the Xbox Live Arcade.

1145
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:21,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't go anywhere, guys.

1146
01:22:21,879 --> 01:22:25,983
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1147
01:22:27,495 --> 01:22:30,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1148
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:35,281
[SPEAKER_05]: We are taping the 388th episode of our show live on this November the 7th of 2010.

1149
01:22:37,122 --> 01:22:43,326
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been talking a little bit in Part A tonight about the new Kinect obviously is out and we've all had a chance to get our hands on it.

1150
01:22:43,607 --> 01:22:47,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is weird because I still have yet to really play PlayStation Move outside of E3.

1151
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:51,292
[SPEAKER_05]: But Loki, you've gotten a chance to get your hands on both at this point now.

1152
01:22:51,752 --> 01:22:52,313
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think...

1153
01:22:52,893 --> 01:22:54,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Both are going to offer us in a year's time.

1154
01:22:56,435 --> 01:23:02,577
[SPEAKER_04]: The move, I think, is going to pretty much be what you see right now with the Nintendo Wii.

1155
01:23:02,837 --> 01:23:08,860
[SPEAKER_04]: The only difference being that since they do have the camera in there, they can do some of the augmented reality stuff, which is actually pretty cool with it.

1156
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:34,012
[SPEAKER_04]: um I don't think it's really that different and they do um I don't know they have more of a setup now where they're going to kind of use it with more of their hardcore games I guess because like Killzone 3 is already going to have that SOCOM 4 they've got support for it so it'll be interesting to see how they implement that stuff or if you know it's even going to be necessary or you know you're going to be able to play as well with it

1157
01:23:34,712 --> 01:23:50,326
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course the Kinect it's hard to say how that's going to really I think there's a lot more potential with the Kinect because they can pretty much do whatever they want with no controller gaming but then they can also if they wanted to and they've said it before they're like

1158
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:56,432
[SPEAKER_04]: You know we can have this so that it works with you playing, not using the controller, right?

1159
01:23:56,692 --> 01:23:59,494
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the complaints, oh, there's no buttons and stuff.

1160
01:23:59,514 --> 01:24:06,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, who says that we can't do that or put out another controller later or, you know, whatever.

1161
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:12,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so there, it's, I think there's a lot more creative freedom with the Kinect than there is with the Move.

1162
01:24:14,224 --> 01:24:23,948
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think this says or is going to do anyway about the possible Xbox 720, the PlayStation 4, the Wii 2, and obviously all these names are hypothetical.

1163
01:24:24,328 --> 01:24:30,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but if you notice, and I'm not sure if this is necessarily because Microsoft's spending more money on advertising.

1164
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,812
[SPEAKER_04]: because they are spending a lot of money on advertising.

1165
01:24:33,213 --> 01:24:42,121
[SPEAKER_04]: But have you noticed, like, with the whole Kinect stuff, there's been a lot bigger of a splash with the Kinect stuff as far as, like, all the, you know, talk shows and stuff like that.

1166
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:42,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.

1167
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:43,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there was the movie.

1168
01:24:43,823 --> 01:24:45,184
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie just, like, came out and, like,

1169
01:24:45,644 --> 01:24:46,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It's here, guys.

1170
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:48,026
[SPEAKER_05]: They had commercials.

1171
01:24:48,466 --> 01:24:53,789
[SPEAKER_05]: That's mostly of what you've seen for the move and targeted commercials during things like South Park.

1172
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:55,831
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd always see a commercial for the move.

1173
01:24:56,151 --> 01:24:56,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Things of that sort.

1174
01:24:57,111 --> 01:25:08,719
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, definitely the Kinect is definitely trying to go that Nintendo route of being on Ellen, being on the news, doing the whole Times Square thing that they did.

1175
01:25:08,739 --> 01:25:10,440
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be very interesting.

1176
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:10,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1177
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:23,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Nintendo gets to go through this whole hub-a-loo again with a 3DS because that's going to be another big thing that, you know, they'll parade that out on the Ellen show too and she'll go like, wow, it's like I could really see 3D guys, you know, and the whole thing.

1178
01:25:24,377 --> 01:25:25,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Some corny joke.

1179
01:25:25,218 --> 01:25:25,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, let's dance.

1180
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:26,680
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.

1181
01:25:27,181 --> 01:25:27,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1182
01:25:27,641 --> 01:25:28,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be what happens.

1183
01:25:29,143 --> 01:25:29,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1184
01:25:31,138 --> 01:25:34,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1185
01:25:34,621 --> 01:25:37,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, I think the next Wii will be a Super Wii.

1186
01:25:38,423 --> 01:25:39,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It's certainly a possibility.

1187
01:25:39,724 --> 01:25:46,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that might be a silly idea, but, you know, the Wii has that recognition, just like Nintendo had back in the day as a system.

1188
01:25:47,069 --> 01:25:48,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was the Super NES.

1189
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:51,692
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that whole Wii HD, everyone likes to theorize about it.

1190
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:54,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and Frisbee follows that up with, and then the Wii 64.

1191
01:25:55,034 --> 01:25:58,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Ross Steel UT says, the Kinect is more novel than the Move.

1192
01:25:58,697 --> 01:25:59,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be real.

1193
01:26:00,018 --> 01:26:00,338
[SPEAKER_05]: You agree?

1194
01:26:01,659 --> 01:26:02,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

1195
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:08,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing, like I've said... Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I think it's more something we haven't seen before.

1196
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is and it isn't.

1197
01:26:10,425 --> 01:26:13,087
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like more of an evolution than the move does.

1198
01:26:13,547 --> 01:26:19,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, the technology behind the move sounds pretty cool compared to what we've seen on the Wii.

1199
01:26:19,371 --> 01:26:21,172
[SPEAKER_05]: We just don't see a lot of that in motion yet.

1200
01:26:21,192 --> 01:26:24,614
[SPEAKER_05]: But this whole augmented reality and all the stuff you talk about makes me very excited.

1201
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:25,715
[SPEAKER_05]: The potential.

1202
01:26:26,336 --> 01:26:27,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the other thing too.

1203
01:26:27,376 --> 01:26:28,897
[SPEAKER_04]: The augmented reality stuff...

1204
01:26:30,178 --> 01:26:35,800
[SPEAKER_04]: is possible with the Kinect.

1205
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:36,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, who's to say?

1206
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it can track your body.

1207
01:26:38,641 --> 01:26:47,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's to say you can't, I don't know, even just have a game come out and have something as simple as you hold up a piece of cardboard and there you go.

1208
01:26:47,683 --> 01:26:49,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it just has to have something like a target for it.

1209
01:26:50,284 --> 01:26:52,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And it basically uses the sensors that are in the

1210
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,647
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, move controller and the orb to track that.

1211
01:26:56,987 --> 01:27:01,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you... There's potential they could do all the same stuff.

1212
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:13,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it has a good, you know... It can track you really well, as we saw with, you know, Dance Masters, where it can do a literal... Almost like a green screen of myself while I'm playing the game.

1213
01:27:13,797 --> 01:27:22,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I really want to see that, because that's very... I feel like an idiot already, and looking at myself playing the game, it's just like...

1214
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:23,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you doing this?

1215
01:27:25,264 --> 01:27:26,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask Jamie here for a minute.

1216
01:27:26,704 --> 01:27:29,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean to take you away from our lovely chatters.

1217
01:27:29,586 --> 01:27:31,227
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatroom at chat.orange.com.

1218
01:27:31,527 --> 01:27:37,491
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know you don't get as into the new stuff, I think, as you have the classics.

1219
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,333
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely, the most room in your heart is for the classic games.

1220
01:27:40,813 --> 01:27:45,356
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this new, I mean, certainly this is technology we never really saw before in the classic gaming world.

1221
01:27:45,656 --> 01:27:52,340
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about the Kinect and the Move and all this and its potential impact on gaming?

1222
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:55,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the move looks like a sex toy, so I'm completely not interested.

1223
01:27:56,969 --> 01:27:57,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Connect, I like.

1224
01:27:58,690 --> 01:27:59,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

1225
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:08,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it combines everything that they were trying to do with the move and with the eye toy, except it doesn't write.

1226
01:28:10,213 --> 01:28:15,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And it definitely gives you more of that virtual environment feel to your games.

1227
01:28:15,394 --> 01:28:16,795
[SPEAKER_02]: That, I think, is great.

1228
01:28:16,935 --> 01:28:17,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that...

1229
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:20,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it going two ways.

1230
01:28:21,057 --> 01:28:26,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I can think we're going to get more and more and more like that and it'll be great or it will wear off after a while.

1231
01:28:26,503 --> 01:28:31,027
[SPEAKER_02]: The novelty will wear off and people want to sit back on their couches with their controllers in their hands.

1232
01:28:31,968 --> 01:28:34,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I like half agree with DarkSakura.

1233
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:34,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of...

1234
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:38,373
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kinect, there's some things about it that strike me as gimmicky too.

1235
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:44,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and I think it's that we haven't really seen its full potential yet, whereas at least Sony's kind of like throwing these things out there.

1236
01:28:44,536 --> 01:28:50,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't write off the move quite as fast, but I will say right now, there's nothing I really want on the move.

1237
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:54,581
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing the move is doing for me and the type of games I like right now.

1238
01:28:55,321 --> 01:28:57,543
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of possibilities for things they can do.

1239
01:28:57,563 --> 01:29:03,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the whole head tracking demo that we saw with the Wii where they have the guy wearing the Wii remote?

1240
01:29:03,329 --> 01:29:05,831
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do that with the Kinect because it tracks your head.

1241
01:29:07,052 --> 01:29:09,294
[SPEAKER_04]: They can do that kind of stuff for first-person shooters.

1242
01:29:09,314 --> 01:29:11,996
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was saying that it's not necessarily...

1243
01:29:12,737 --> 01:29:28,529
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't have to have a game where you're just moving around like crazy they could just have it where they track your head you're doing all your movements and stuff on the controller and you can still be slightly more immersed in the game and it can be an optional feature which is kind of cool you can bring the mocap games home yeah

1244
01:29:28,999 --> 01:29:36,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really interested to see what next year's E3 is going to be because at next year's E3, all of this is going to be the norm.

1245
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:43,960
[SPEAKER_05]: The 3DS is going to be out by next E3 and all the rumors about the March release date or what have you, but it'll be out before June.

1246
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:44,701
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a given.

1247
01:29:45,442 --> 01:29:48,425
[SPEAKER_05]: All of this stuff is now going to be the norm at NextE3.

1248
01:29:48,585 --> 01:29:49,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Move is now out.

1249
01:29:49,646 --> 01:29:50,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Connect is now out.

1250
01:29:50,947 --> 01:29:51,848
[SPEAKER_05]: 3DS is now out.

1251
01:29:52,188 --> 01:29:57,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be really interesting because the NextE3 is now going to be all about, okay, now what are you going to do with this?

1252
01:29:57,874 --> 01:30:01,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that it's out, what have you come up with in the past year for how to use this technology?

1253
01:30:02,057 --> 01:30:03,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a very interesting show.

1254
01:30:03,659 --> 01:30:05,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited about it.

1255
01:30:05,701 --> 01:30:07,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's like, what, nine months away?

1256
01:30:07,182 --> 01:30:07,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1257
01:30:08,243 --> 01:30:09,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go this year.

1258
01:30:09,164 --> 01:30:09,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1259
01:30:10,586 --> 01:30:12,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we can make it all work for us.

1260
01:30:13,229 --> 01:30:13,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1261
01:30:14,351 --> 01:30:22,321
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I was just thinking, I still, if you put both in front of me and said pick which one you want for free, I'd grab the Kinect.

1262
01:30:24,235 --> 01:30:30,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I think me too, but only because it goes back to the rule of the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1263
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:36,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wouldn't write the move off yet, because a year from now, we might be looking at the opposite.

1264
01:30:38,426 --> 01:30:39,647
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just kind of what I see.

1265
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:44,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure I really see where Kinect is going, but maybe I'll be proven wrong at the next E3.

1266
01:30:44,551 --> 01:30:51,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, if anything, if the whole point of releasing these new motion systems were to capture...

1267
01:30:51,676 --> 01:30:56,758
[SPEAKER_04]: The new audience that they're looking for, the more casual audience, I think that Kinect has done a better job of that.

1268
01:30:57,158 --> 01:30:58,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least it seems like it.

1269
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:01,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the move, I don't think a lot of people care.

1270
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:06,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's too bad, because it's not a bad piece of hardware, it's just not...

1271
01:31:07,502 --> 01:31:17,527
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just slightly better, and yeah, granted the hardware is better, so you can do better looking games, but it's not completely different.

1272
01:31:17,587 --> 01:31:22,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas I would say the Kinect is completely different than what they're doing with the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

1273
01:31:22,889 --> 01:31:24,030
[SPEAKER_04]: It is separate.

1274
01:31:26,052 --> 01:31:31,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think one thing to consider as far as new hardware goes, I don't think it came up anywhere else in our show role, but something that's been coming up.

1275
01:31:31,796 --> 01:31:38,040
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a lot the week we were out, but were those rumors of the PSP phone and some of the screenshots that showed up and all that.

1276
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:42,443
[SPEAKER_05]: So if this new PSP evolution is going to be shown at E3, it could be interesting.

1277
01:31:42,843 --> 01:31:49,007
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think it's going to be anything outside of this whole motion gaming stuff and what we're talking about here.

1278
01:31:49,707 --> 01:31:50,308
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

1279
01:31:51,095 --> 01:31:56,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on into some rapid fire news and some of the quick stories we have for you now.

1280
01:31:56,198 --> 01:31:57,799
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot since we had a week off.

1281
01:31:57,939 --> 01:31:59,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, we're going to start with you with a quick news.

1282
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:00,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1283
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:01,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

1284
01:32:01,521 --> 01:32:02,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter topics.

1285
01:32:02,201 --> 01:32:02,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Get them in quick.

1286
01:32:02,841 --> 01:32:03,862
[SPEAKER_05]: You have about two more minutes.

1287
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:04,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1288
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, some interesting stuff going on.

1289
01:32:09,051 --> 01:32:15,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we were talking a little bit about Dance Central and Harmonix being the ones that like to support download content.

1290
01:32:15,553 --> 01:32:18,593
[SPEAKER_04]: They had some download content day one, whether you like that or not.

1291
01:32:19,654 --> 01:32:23,834
[SPEAKER_04]: New songs that are coming out for Dance Central are going to run you $299 or $240 Microsoft points each.

1292
01:32:26,115 --> 01:32:26,896
[SPEAKER_04]: and Sean Paul's Temperature.

1293
01:32:26,956 --> 01:32:32,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess those are all available now and hopefully we'll see some more download content next week.

1294
01:32:42,978 --> 01:32:43,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

1295
01:32:43,838 --> 01:32:49,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't really say if the same moves are in there or if they're recycled or whatever.

1296
01:32:51,541 --> 01:32:52,441
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's kind of neat.

1297
01:32:52,461 --> 01:32:59,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish that the game had kind of a routine editor because they could easily do that with the flashcards and stuff they have on there.

1298
01:33:01,483 --> 01:33:03,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Can anyone say the sequel?

1299
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:04,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1300
01:33:05,312 --> 01:33:08,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Black Friday is not too far away.

1301
01:33:08,934 --> 01:33:11,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And with Black Friday, of course, the ads will leak out.

1302
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:17,198
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one to leak out with gaming-related information, of course, would be from Sears.

1303
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:24,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had some new bundles and stuff for the holidays and some new interesting colors for different things.

1304
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:29,385
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the limited edition red and green DSi bundles for $150, which include Mario Party DS.

1305
01:33:32,567 --> 01:33:42,354
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a 160 gigabyte PlayStation 3 bundle for $300, which includes Uncharted 2 and a Blu-ray of the new movie Karate Kid.

1306
01:33:43,395 --> 01:33:47,098
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP... What a deal.

1307
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:49,540
[SPEAKER_04]: The PSP 3000, well, I think those two games are free.

1308
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,902
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just the whole Karate Kid Blu-ray.

1309
01:33:53,803 --> 01:33:54,804
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bad movie, I liked it.

1310
01:33:56,384 --> 01:33:57,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I just refuse to see it.

1311
01:33:57,685 --> 01:33:59,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being stuck up for no reason.

1312
01:33:59,825 --> 01:34:00,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good, okay.

1313
01:34:01,286 --> 01:34:04,307
[SPEAKER_04]: The PSP 3000 bundle for $130, which includes LittleBigPlanet and UMD of the Karate Kid.

1314
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,208
[SPEAKER_04]: 4GB Xbox 360 bundle for $200, which includes Halo Reach.

1315
01:34:06,248 --> 01:34:06,988
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad.

1316
01:34:16,972 --> 01:34:21,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they had $10 off of a standard, I guess, Wii bundle.

1317
01:34:21,917 --> 01:34:31,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, also they're going to be doing, um, discounts on different games like, uh, Medal of Honor, Fable 3, Halo Reach, all will be available for $40.

1318
01:34:31,747 --> 01:34:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1319
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:52,445
[SPEAKER_04]: which is pretty awesome and actually this is kind of cool one of the games that's being marked down to $40 which will be just coming out about around that time Need for Speed Hot Pursuit so if you're interested in that game which you should be because it's by Criterion and they do really awesome racing games you should definitely check it out

1320
01:34:54,403 --> 01:34:59,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, Loki, that of the Smith kids, I think Willow is more talented because she whips her hair back and forth.

1321
01:35:00,869 --> 01:35:01,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1322
01:35:01,249 --> 01:35:02,350
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie was not bad.

1323
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:02,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

1324
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:03,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you say.

1325
01:35:03,551 --> 01:35:04,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed the movie a lot.

1326
01:35:04,352 --> 01:35:05,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it the Kung Fu Kid?

1327
01:35:06,153 --> 01:35:06,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

1328
01:35:07,795 --> 01:35:08,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the Kung Fu Kid.

1329
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:10,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1330
01:35:11,178 --> 01:35:12,999
[SPEAKER_04]: They think we're dumb, so whatever.

1331
01:35:15,525 --> 01:35:21,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and then of course, with that, there's some new Xbox demos that came out on the Marketplace this week.

1332
01:35:22,107 --> 01:35:25,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band 3, which is pretty awesome, so you can check out a few songs from that.

1333
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:33,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Apache Air Assault, which is a helicopter attack game that's coming out on the 360 and PS3 in, I believe, next week or so.

1334
01:35:35,131 --> 01:35:40,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, the most retarded addition to that would be Joyride, which...

1335
01:35:41,093 --> 01:35:47,576
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have the Kinect, you'll realize that there is already a demo for Joyride on the disc of Kinect Adventures.

1336
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:51,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you would need to download an additional demo is beyond me.

1337
01:35:53,687 --> 01:35:54,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Have at it, I guess.

1338
01:35:55,929 --> 01:35:58,251
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, definitely check out those demos if you haven't yet.

1339
01:35:58,991 --> 01:36:06,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Central, Joyride, Your Shape Fitness, and yeah, I believe that was it on there.

1340
01:36:06,437 --> 01:36:08,799
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, three games you can check out for free.

1341
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:11,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I didn't notice that right away, and it said other games.

1342
01:36:11,581 --> 01:36:12,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, other Kinect games?

1343
01:36:12,922 --> 01:36:13,262
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1344
01:36:13,282 --> 01:36:15,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, there's demos on here?

1345
01:36:15,043 --> 01:36:16,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome!

1346
01:36:17,325 --> 01:36:18,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh!

1347
01:36:20,193 --> 01:36:48,679
[SPEAKER_04]: so yeah check that out and then finally I don't know this is kind of ridiculous but apparently with the Wii version of the Michael Jackson the experience game you're going to get the jewel studded white glove to play the game with I guess so that you can feel more like Michael Jackson is it possible to think something is lame and yet totally awesome at the same time like this is totally awesomely lame

1348
01:36:51,810 --> 01:36:53,191
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so bad, it's good.

1349
01:36:53,811 --> 01:36:56,833
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad, it's bad, it's really, really bad.

1350
01:36:58,354 --> 01:36:58,894
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it.

1351
01:37:03,557 --> 01:37:07,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what I would pay to see Loki modeling one of these Michael Jackson gloves.

1352
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:11,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have to get the game when it comes out for the Connect.

1353
01:37:11,382 --> 01:37:13,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say, it actually looks kind of awesome.

1354
01:37:13,803 --> 01:37:19,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's face it, Michael Jackson had some badass songs, and you know there's gonna be good dances.

1355
01:37:19,066 --> 01:37:19,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

1356
01:37:20,347 --> 01:37:24,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Dance with Michael Jackson songs and with optional karaoke.

1357
01:37:24,648 --> 01:37:27,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit about the optional karaoke, but I think that would be awesome.

1358
01:37:27,929 --> 01:37:29,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking love Michael Jackson's stuff.

1359
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:31,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what people say that he did or did not do.

1360
01:37:32,651 --> 01:37:34,451
[SPEAKER_04]: He was an awesome music artist.

1361
01:37:34,511 --> 01:37:35,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with you.

1362
01:37:35,512 --> 01:37:36,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1363
01:37:36,072 --> 01:37:38,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Just ignore all the other stuff.

1364
01:37:38,132 --> 01:37:39,973
[SPEAKER_04]: He has some new songs coming out, apparently.

1365
01:37:40,413 --> 01:38:09,842
[SPEAKER_05]: their rumors are saying that there's a sound like doing some of them but who gives a fuck everything that's been going on with like Tupac and Biggie when they were you know gone before their time and yet it seems like Tupac is still releasing a new album every other year from some shit they dig up expect it to be even worse with Michael Jackson like there will be a new album every year for as long as you're alive and then there will soon be the rumors about he never really died they fake the death and the body that came out of the house wasn't really him and

1366
01:38:10,462 --> 01:38:39,931
[SPEAKER_04]: and all this stuff he did it to escape his personal problems even though his kids were up there on stage crying and two more songs apparently have been announced for the game one of which is my wife's absolute favorite Michael Jackson song one I kind of like, Speed Demon and Dirty Diana Dirty Diana her absolute favorite song that's one of my favorites too you know what, my favorite actually isn't one of his dancey ones Man in the Mirror

1367
01:38:40,575 --> 01:38:41,241
[SPEAKER_02]: She's out of my life.

1368
01:38:41,948 --> 01:38:42,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1369
01:38:45,259 --> 01:38:49,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, we need to have a whole Michael Jackson The Game launch party.

1370
01:38:49,821 --> 01:38:53,022
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just don't think everyone else would be as into it.

1371
01:38:53,062 --> 01:38:54,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to get in on the weed.

1372
01:38:54,903 --> 01:38:59,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the generation after us, too, which makes up a lot of our listeners.

1373
01:38:59,724 --> 01:39:02,025
[SPEAKER_05]: They have terrible taste in music, okay?

1374
01:39:02,485 --> 01:39:07,267
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't around when it was about Michael Jackson on MTV.

1375
01:39:07,347 --> 01:39:08,087
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1376
01:39:08,648 --> 01:39:10,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we literally grew up with him.

1377
01:39:11,429 --> 01:39:11,749
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

1378
01:39:12,509 --> 01:39:13,170
[SPEAKER_05]: This is different.

1379
01:39:13,871 --> 01:39:16,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when Thriller was on every hour.

1380
01:39:16,756 --> 01:39:18,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he and my mom were the same age.

1381
01:39:18,759 --> 01:39:19,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1382
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:26,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I went through all of her old stuff and I grew up with the whole thing.

1383
01:39:28,107 --> 01:39:31,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on and talk about other gaming news.

1384
01:39:31,873 --> 01:39:32,654
[SPEAKER_05]: You Don't Know Jack.

1385
01:39:32,835 --> 01:39:35,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, I love this game and I'm so excited it's making a comeback.

1386
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:40,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they did kind of burn that series into the ground.

1387
01:39:40,186 --> 01:39:42,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there was all these You Don't Know Jack games back in the day.

1388
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,332
[SPEAKER_05]: You Don't Know Jack, The Ride, and all this stuff.

1389
01:39:44,753 --> 01:39:45,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are actually kind of cool.

1390
01:39:45,895 --> 01:39:45,975
[SPEAKER_05]: But
