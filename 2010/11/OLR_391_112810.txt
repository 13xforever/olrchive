Sky, and Loki.
Tonight, November 28, 2010, BBC programming comes to video game consoles courtesy of PlayStation Network.
Could indie games soon feature the Kinect?
And another musician sues the makers of Guitar Hero.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is episode number 391 for November 28th of 2010.
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
I had balls.
Well, we want to go there this early in the show?
Fine.
They were meaty and tangy.
Oh, you're talking about meatballs, aren't you?
Yeah, barbecue meatballs.
Where did you get some barbecue meatballs?
From my husband.
I ate his balls.
So you got to eat his balls.
You wouldn't even let me lick his balls.
You can lick them.
There's some left.
Okay, good.
I'll lick them later.
He's got a lot of balls.
All right.
Anyway, let's also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
Hello.
Do I need to ask if you have any interest in licking Dan's balls?
No, I'm quite full.
I'm eating, uh, was it garlic parmesan twists?
Ah, you're downing the sticks over there, I see.
So, no interest in the balls.
That's fine.
They're twists, okay, not sticks.
How is your parmesan twists?
They're okay.
They were late, though, because I got, I, they said 15 to 20 minutes.
Got there 30 minutes later.
It should have been done by now.
I get there and they're like, oh yeah, we forgot to put them in the oven.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yeah.
Cool.
Alright, always present with us is the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Going to Breakman in our chat room starts us off tonight.
Every gamer has a voice, just please don't embarrass the rest of us.
I think that sums it up very well, actually.
Thank you, Breakman.
We do have another guest here in studio.
We are very excited to have her on the show.
She's a good friend of DarkSakura.
She's known for a very long time and I love her to bits too.
And Loki, I don't think they ever really hang out, but they'd probably be besties if they did.
Say hello to Marissa.
How are you?
Hi, kiddies.
How are you?
I'm good.
How are you?
Good.
And do you have like a nickname that you use that we should call you?
Well, I always go in by Marissa Con Gusto, but my boyfriend prefers to call me Marissa Con Busto.
That's right.
Here's the thing, and it's a bummer we don't have the webcam anymore, but Marissa has big boobs.
Oh my god, they're so big.
They're awesome.
So, but we love, we love, she's, and she also has a big brain, everybody, to go with it.
Thank you.
So don't just, don't just stare.
The, uh, the extra boobs are to hold extra brains.
That's right.
Exactly.
Um, and do you, do you even play video games or you're just kind of here for the lols?
Both, you know, actually I listen every week and I've always dated people that are really into games, but I'm kind of an old school gamer and I'm just going to wait for Eternity for another King's Quest to come out and Thief is never going to come out.
I don't care what they say.
Okay, you can stay because retro game, especially if you're going to go straight to King's Quest, which is something like the Holy Grail of PC games.
And, you know, we've actually had a lot of talk about the, and you may not even know this is out here, the fan-made King's Quest, the silver lining.
I've heard about that.
Yeah, it's like totally free, and I think they're on like the second episode now.
And Roberta Williams, even though I think she lives out in the woods in a fort now and has totally disavowed all the gaming industry.
The fort?
That might be her fort, actually, out there in the wilderness.
All I know is that she wants nothing to do with the gaming industry in this day and age.
But she actually kind of gave it a blessing without giving it her blessing.
Like, legally, she can't.
It's basically like...
Hey, I'm not going to make any more of that series until I need more money.
Kind of like how J.K.
Rowling's, I'm not going to make any more books, but maybe I could revisit the world at some point.
When I start running out of money, of course.
I love adventure games, and that's always been my thing, but there was all this hype about Siberia coming out, and that's like, to sit like no one ever boldly sat before.
I bet you would like some of the stuff that Telltale does, because they're trying to make that live on with the whole Sam & Max games.
They've got the Back to the Future games coming out soon.
I bet you that type of stuff would be right up their alley.
We need to get you and Seg here on the same night, because he works there, and he could...
He could sell you much better than I could.
Anyhow, I just have to go to the chat room.
I just want to give you a taste at the chatters.
I'm not even going to read the names here.
Here we go.
You ready?
Let's see.
Actually, I will say Jessica Harper said, bigger than mine.
Possibly.
I think so.
I think you might both have to whip them out and we'll see.
Whoever wins this contest doesn't actually win.
You know what I mean?
But here's some of the other comments.
Awesomely big.
Big boobs.
The mighty rack.
Take a photo and post it in the OLR gallery.
OMG boobs.
Her boobs have brains in them.
Everybody likes boobs.
Boobs.
Balls.
That's what this show's turned into tonight.
Pics of tits or get the fuck out.
That was from a girl.
My boyfriend tells me tits are good for us, so it's okay.
Is it weird that I'm the one that's keeping the show grounded at this point?
Is that strange to you?
Clearly there was some type of crack cocaine in our turkey for the Thanksgiving holiday.
I hope you all had a pleasant Thanksgiving.
I hope you didn't get in a car wreck or anything.
But if you're listening to the show, you must be fine.
So congratulations, and I hope you had a wonderful... He's not a girl.
No, I know.
The names were all running together, and I read it to somebody else.
Sorry.
It's live radio.
I don't always do well at it.
Even though it's only been, what, nine years?
So anyway, Marissa's going to join us tonight and lol with us.
And Shirley, if you have any input, you just jump right in there.
And you will have no problem jumping right in there.
We might play a game later, too, in Part B. So that'll be fun.
We'll get the chatters involved.
It's called Guess Marissa's Cup Size.
Oh, stop.
That would be a hard one.
We don't want to give Marissa a complex or make people think it's only about her boobs because actually you are a musician, correct?
Yes.
And what type of music do you do?
I do a neo-folk pop thing, but as most professionals... Neo-folk pop?
Yeah.
Acoustic is probably the better word, because you say folky, and people think like Peter, Paul, and Mary, you know?
So like, Jewel, do you yodel?
Um, well, uh, no.
Okay.
Because if you said yes, I was going to make you do it.
Well, I think, you know, most musicians nowadays specialize in being broke, so that's my...
You are actually the definition of starving L.A.
artist.
What's that old joke?
What do you call a musician without a girlfriend?
Homeless.
DarkSakura.com
well we played some rock band of the Beatles and three variety and Marissa belted out a good one and some Star Trek online a lot of games on my phone that's about it
All right.
You look amused, like you're about to laugh about something.
It's just chat and boobs, and the show amuses me.
It's okay to laugh.
I am wearing my Silent Hill shirt, though.
I'm very happy.
Yes, you are.
Because it's cold, and I can wear my Silent Hill shirt.
At least it's not foggy.
Then that might be the right kind of atmosphere.
It was the other day.
Was it?
Yes, it was.
It was quite foggy last night.
All right, well, let's go to Loki.
How was your gaming week?
Anything new or exciting?
No, unfortunately not.
It really is just Grand Theft Auto this week and Stick Wars on my iPod.
That was about it.
I mean, really.
What is Stick Wars?
Stick Wars, remember that game Defender Castle where you take little stick figures and throw them into the air?
You told me a little bit about this last week.
It's basically like a knockoff of that.
And then, so I've been playing it forever now.
And...
Thanks for watching!
Well, it sounds like you didn't have much of a holiday.
You had more of a working past few days.
And fixed my sister's computer because she got like 65 different things of spyware on there.
That takes talent.
How many porn sites does one have to visit to get all of that?
Spyware install.
I just reinstalled Windows.
It's my old laptop that I used to bring in.
Thankfully, it, you know, because I was like, well, I hate the fact that this has a super recovery partition.
I love the fact that that has a stupid recovery partition because all it is, ah, fuck it, I don't care, backup, and it'll just erase everything out of there, reinstall Windows with all the stuff that was on there from when I got it, and any files that were important get backed up into a folder, delete everything else, and we're good.
So I can reinstall Windows, like, super quick.
It's awesome.
But yeah, that's pretty much all I was doing.
I was hoping to play some Kinect stuff.
Never got around to that.
In fact, can't now because I moved the coffee table to put the tree in.
So I don't have room anymore to play Kinect in my living room.
I notice a lot of people complaining about the amount of space that Kinect requires.
That for a lot of people, it actually isn't practical.
I've noticed that kind of buzz around the internet lately.
A lot of people complaining about the space you need.
Well, it's just that coffee table.
I don't like it anymore.
It's a coffee table I got from my grandparents.
I mean, it's old.
And it's really cumbersome.
I'm thinking of getting two Ottomans instead and just sitting them next to each other for a coffee table.
That way we can use them as seating as well if we need to.
And we can move them out of the way a lot easier.
It's just that set of furniture is just really old.
Um...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yes, our work, they do these parties once a month or whatever at the end of each month.
So last week was technically the end of the month because we weren't there this week.
And you rode a mechanical bull.
Yes.
This is sounding more like a drunken sorority party than... No.
Okay.
It was funny because I wanted to see, you know, I wanted to do it better than everybody else.
Sure, of course.
And how long did you last?
I did really well, actually.
In fact, I was taunting the guy that was operating it, and so he did it, you know, really difficult ride, and I kicked the crap out of it, so it was fun.
So you just have to hold on and...
Pretty much.
It was pretty easy.
No, but other than that, just a lot more Dance Central.
Actually, I did play a little bit of Dance Central during work.
Just some of the few songs on there.
I'm thinking of getting some download content, but I'm going to have to wait until I upgrade certain systems.
You do know there are very, very few people out there listening to the show or anywhere that can say, I played Dance Central at work.
Well, on my break, you know.
no I know but still this is funny and of course still working on editing Grand Theft Auto stuff and then yesterday I was messing with it's not even really a game well I consider it a game because I'm getting free money for exploiting a website so that was kind of a game it's this website appredeem.com you download free apps paid apps or if you have a jailbroken phone free apps and they give you money
Interesting.
Like straight into your PayPal account.
This sounds like one of those free iPod schemes.
It's not a scheme though, but here's the thing.
I mean, I guess they're trying to entice you to buy the apps, but if you really don't want to, you just put in your PayPal account, the email that you use for your PayPal account, and you can just go download the free apps and you get like $1.50 for free.
Weird.
So you don't even have to buy any of the paid apps.
Just download the free ones.
Hmm.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
See, if I was trying to exploit everything, I would give out a link or something that would have some sort of referral thing or something where I'd get credit for it, but I don't care.
I'm just saying, though, that all you do is download these apps, you go into them for like a second, go back to the website, you get credit for it, delete the app, you're done.
I like this comment in our chatroom.
Actdeft says, a week later, my PayPal account got hacked.
I don't think they can hack your PayPal account by just giving them an email address.
Or use a different one.
Yeah, exactly.
I didn't realize they were going to use that email address as a PayPal account, so I had to actually create a second PayPal account for the email address I gave them.
Whatever.
I'll just send it to my original PayPal account.
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
That's it.
Alright.
Marissa, I don't know if you've been playing any games recently, but I thought I'd ask if there's anything.
I know you have one of those fancy Windows phones now or something.
I don't know.
Maybe you've been playing games on that.
You don't put the word fancy and Windows phone together.
Well, they have this new thing.
Maybe it's like the new Windows phone.
They're really pushing, but it's this whole Xbox Live integration and it's trying to compete with the iPhone.
Excuse me.
I have a Touch Pro 2 and nobody cares anything for it.
It's Sprint, but
I only pay, you know, $35 a month, so I'll deal with it.
But I've, I don't know, I've heard just within the community, because I was looking, you know, like I'm ineligible for any upgrades, even though the hardware is capable of it, which stinks.
But HTC makes a good phone, so at least I know that everything else is solid.
And I lost my rock band virginity to Jamie.
Nice.
So...
So you actually did some of the singing in the game?
I did the singing and I played guitar and bass and I guess I have to go back and now tell my musician friends who are always bitching about it that they appreciate it.
This is where I wanted to go with this because a lot of musicians, I'm glad you brought this up, because a lot of musicians like to razz on rock band because it's not really playing an instrument and it's like dumbing down music.
Did you feel that way or were you like, no, this is just fun and nothing else?
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
I don't know if you got to see any of this, but probably not because I don't think the actual guitars are out or I don't think Jamie has them, but there's actually these pro modes now in Rock Band where you can learn to play the real instrument.
I've been doing it for keyboard, which is kind of fun because I used to play keyboard back when I was like 12, so it's kind of fun to get back into that.
And you know, if you wait long enough, even though it is kind of an inferior game, according to reviews, I'm sure Power Geek will drop in price really quickly.
And it has an electric guitar with it, too.
That's what I saw.
Actually, the thing that ticked me off about that, though, I mean, I know there's the gaming part of it, but you could get a really nice starter guitar for the price of that piece of crap.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
We're honest here at OLR.
Just like for the, you know, if you want to play the game, that's fine.
If you want to play and even use that to learn, that's fine too.
But it's way overpriced considering you can go get a nice squire.
I think for some people, though, it's really that interactivity, being able to kind of interact and get that.
We're a very instant gratification society, right?
So to pick up a guitar and just kind of strum sometimes isn't because you're not sure if you're doing it right.
Unless you're playing Green Day songs, then who cares?
What I think that we should do... Did you know there's a whole rock band that's just Green Day?
I don't know how you can do that.
It's only three chords.
Well, because there's five buttons.
So it works.
I'm sorry, man.
No, no.
What they need to do is just have another contest or something, like a power gig contest.
Once those things get cheap enough, you just smash the guitar at the end of each song.
It's fun.
It's like, yeah, this game sucks, but that felt good.
Thanks for watching!
Nice.
Will it blend?
All right.
So good.
I'm glad the musician got to try some rock bands.
So will you try it again at some point?
Oh, it was so much fun.
It really was.
Awesome.
Awesome.
The harmony feature is really neat, too.
Yeah, the harmony feature is kind of cool because it's hard for some people to hear the harmony, I think.
And that takes a little while to kind of train your ears to be able to hear that.
So kind of to...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I have found some new bands through Rock Band.
There's a song I really like in Rock Band 3, Last Dance.
And I'd never heard, I think the band's like the Ravenettes or something.
I'd never heard of them before.
But I really like the song.
I checked out their CD.
It's kind of cool.
So there you go.
All right.
My Gaming Week.
I actually played...
A few different games this week And a lot of that is thanks to the Steam sale But I'll get to that in a minute I did touch back on some of the games I played last week Now last week I'd only played demos But this week I did just jump in And I bought the full version of Super Meat Boy Which is, it's pretty great I gotta say, it's actually I would go so far as to say It's one of the best arcade games That is out there right now, period Like, at all And I would have never thought that this game would fall in that category But I love the kind of like
I want to say it's almost like a WarioWare-ish game, but Mario-style.
What I mean by that is that a lot of the levels in the game should take you no more than 30 seconds to beat.
And most of them are in the 15-20 second range.
So it's really about learning the exact right pattern to beat a level.
It's like playing an old Mega Man game or something, I don't know.
I'm just having a lot of fun getting extraordinarily frustrated playing Super Meat Boy when I'm like two seconds away from beating a level and just screwing it up.
And I gotta tell you, Alan was watching me play and he wants to watch me play just to laugh at me getting so frustrated when I get so close to beating a level and then I like, oops, fall in the gear and get Super Meat Boy all chopped up or whatever.
So yeah, I actually think Super Meat Boy is amazing.
My only, I guess, complaint is that I think in some ways it's almost too hard to
Like, there's a lot of people that are going to buy Super Meat Boy that are never going to get past the second level.
And it's kind of unfortunate.
But if you keep with it, I mean, that can also be the big reward with it.
Did you get to check out the internet?
No, I haven't got there yet.
I don't know if that's towards the end or what, but I'm only on like the third level.
It's taken me a long time to get there too.
I mean, it's been quite a bit of gaming time.
so uh I will keep trying to get there I love the warp zones that take you to the retro style levels I thought that was amazing and it has like retro music and the soundtrack is astounding I'm gonna um for the live listeners I'll do some of the soundtrack for break tonight but the soundtrack is astounding it is great and it's all like indie stuff I think the guy who did the soundtrack's not really done any other games before so it's um it's great there's really only one one Xbox Live Arcade game I'm waiting for um
and unfortunately, I don't know when it's coming out, the Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.
Never heard of that.
You gotta watch the video for it.
Okay.
It's awesome.
Should I look it up right now?
Yeah.
What is it?
It's got an awesome song that goes with it.
It's, I don't even know, it's not really a shooter, but you play it like a UFO.
It's this guy, he's a really good artist.
Alrighty, I'm loading up Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet debut trailer.
I'm gonna jump in the middle here though.
Awesome song goes along with it.
I'm not hearing... Oh, because I can't play.
Oh, this kind of has that... What's that game?
Limbo?
What the hell is that game?
I can't think of the name.
Not Braid, but the other artsy one.
Now it's looking like an anime or something.
Planets collide!
No, like when they get down to the actual gameplay.
Well, that's... It's a little like UFOs flying.
This is part of the game where the UFOs fly?
Yeah, that's all part of the game.
What is this, an arcade release?
Yeah, Xbox Live Arcade and PC.
Arcade games are getting very interesting.
It's almost like you're like this little UFO and you're flying through different levels and dodging obstacles.
Wow, something that's really interesting.
Okay.
Yeah, the art style is pretty rad on this.
I like that.
That does look pretty cool.
I like that.
Kind of like a half-shooter, half... Almost like the same concept as Super Meat Boy.
You're trying to get through a level, get through these tricky ways.
I'm going to paste the link there in chat.
Sorry, folks listening on podcasts, but you won't be able to get that link.
But just look for Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.
Interesting.
Alright.
Also, I played more Pac-Man Championship Edition Deluxe, which I love.
There's very, very satisfying rewards when you gobble up a train of 30 ghosts and get the high score.
Again, the music's great.
Kind of the same stuff I was saying last week.
Buying the retail version didn't really change my opinions there.
I still think it's a worthy upgrade if you like the last one.
New games I played this week, thanks to Steam and some of the sales going on there.
I did finally play Poker Night at the Inventory, because that finally came out, which is the Texas Hold'em poker game that features some of the characters that you see in various Telltale games, and Valve, really, because Heavy from Team Fortress is in there, Tycho is in there, and Strong Bad.
It's a Texas Hold'em game.
and uh it's it's really kind of that's it it's really a no frills poker game there's not a whole lot of modes there is not a multiplayer so you might be wondering well then why would i bother with this game well a it's five dollars right i think it's only five dollars to get this game and uh ten and most i think it's only five though and there was a lot of sales going on during the pre-order i think i paid five for it like two months ago
Thank you for watching!
The rest, like the heavy and the max, I can kind of give and take.
But yeah, I loved Strong Bad.
Tycho's all right, but I don't know.
There's something about him where he comes off as a real smug asshole in the game.
That's exactly his character.
Yes, but I don't know.
When I read Penny Arcade, I don't quite get it as strong as I get it in the Poker Night game.
Maybe even better if it was Gabe.
But it was fine.
It's fine.
I mean, for a $5 poker game, I more look at it as you're buying laughs.
If you want an actual poker game, this is not the game to get.
It's not.
It's a very no-frills, low thing.
DarkSakura.com
But don't expect a lot of modes and extra stuff.
Unless there's unlockable things that I haven't found yet, which I wouldn't doubt at all, actually.
I wouldn't doubt at all that there'd be some hidden shit in there that I just haven't found yet, and that's fine.
I actually bought the game.
I didn't get a review copy that has the little sheet that tells you how to get all the unlocks that a lot of publishers do.
Also, another game that I got, Reketeer, an item shop's tale, I think was the name of the game.
It's a PC version of a game that looks like it was done on the PlayStation 1.
And I don't know if it was translated or what the deal is, but Alan summed it up perfectly.
He was looking at it going, this game is so weeaboo.
And that's really what it is.
It's just this very...
Chibi, Teehee, I'm playing a dumb girl that's opening an item shop and I have this little fairy that helps navigate me through the complex item shop stuff and we go to the village and find a hero to take us through the dungeons.
It's just like, oh my god, I'm gonna barf.
This is so just stupid.
But...
I will say one thing I liked about it.
Well, A, I bought it in a pack of like five games for five bucks.
So like considering I paid a whole dollar for Reketeer, it's hard to complain.
But B, I actually really like the idea of the game because the idea of the game is that you're not the hero.
You run the item shop in a hero's game.
It's on my wish list.
Which is kind of, oh, it's a bummer you didn't sign in a couple days ago and it was on sale for like five bucks.
I've been too busy having fun with Marissa.
Oh, fine.
I guess that's fair enough.
Having pillow fights and talking about boobies.
All right.
So yeah, Reketeer, I honestly would not pay more than $5 for this game.
And even then, it's like, you might want to check out a demo first and see if it's really for you.
But some of the like, okay, I didn't even really describe the game.
I'm all over the place tonight, guys.
Sorry.
You run an item shop.
and so you can buy and sell things you can buy things from people to come in or you can sell things that you find in dungeons and in order to go into a dungeon you hire a hero to go into the dungeon for you and I don't know they somehow write this into the very chibi story that the item shop girl is protected and she can't get hit by the monsters but the hero can
DarkSakura.com
I'm looking in our chatroom at chat.orangeentredo.com and some of the folks talking about Poker Night at the Inventory.
Deathwishing says, Sky, there's Team Fortress 2 hats.
Yes, I have heard that there are unlocks for other games in it.
I did miss that.
So yeah, that's correct.
You can unlock some items that show up in other games.
It's pretty cool.
Breakman in chat says, What the fuck?
Sky buys his games after heavily drinking?
I don't think I was drinking heavily when I bought that game, actually.
So there you go.
Alright, anyhow, yeah, so Reketeer is, if you like those like chibi import PlayStation 1 games, then this is right up your alley, but if you're looking for like a serious RPG, don't bother.
But I like the concept.
I like that idea that you're not always the hero, that sometimes you're the girl running the item shop who's kind of a ditz.
Fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's why we had to get Marissa up here this time.
But we will still be bringing you much OLR through the rest of the year.
If you like the show, and we hope you do, please consider adding us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
We're also on Facebook.
You can like us at Orange Lounge Radio.
Just search for that and we should come right up.
We always want more fans on Facebook.
It helps us spread the word about our show because we don't have big budgets of advertising dollars or any of that good stuff.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We haven't reported on PSP firmware updates in a while, probably because a lot of people have kind of written off the PSP.
But anyways, there is a firmware update, 6.35, and it adds Curiosity, which I guess is a new music streaming service called Music Unlimited, which I guess is powered by Curiosity.
X-Radar GPS Mapping Software
I feel like this is something that's been in there a while, or maybe it's like a newer technology, I don't know.
Well, they've had a GPS add-on for a long time, and I want to say that I believe all the other regions have support for it, but they just never sold it over here, which is too bad, because that'd be pretty awesome to have GPS on, you know, a PSP might make it kind of worth it, but at this point I think they've just given up on it.
Um...
And I'm also assuming that there's some sort of fixes for software hacks and stuff like that in there because that's always something that they kind of do.
But that is available, I believe, now.
So, neat.
It's kind of late, if you ask me, though, to add a music service to the PSP, considering, I mean, it's almost at the end of its life cycle.
Or are you saying that just because we've had all this talk about PSP 2 news lately?
It's going to be announced next year.
I mean, come on.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's coming out next year.
Oh, it's coming out, I bet you, by holiday next year.
Well, that's still one year away from today.
That's still at the end of its life cycle.
I mean, what big games have they announced for the PSP that haven't come out yet?
Well, they're kind of still being powered by some of the big titles that came out.
Like, that Kingdom Hearts game is pretty beautiful, if you kind of see it.
Yeah, but, I mean, come on.
Like, the only things that they had come out in November that were worthwhile, I guess, the new God of War game goes to Sparta, which...
I mean, come on.
How many prequel games to the God of War series do we really need?
And then they did have another Ghost Recon game come out on the PSP, but there's not a lot of other things that are available for the PSP that are kind of worthwhile.
It's really slowing down.
I don't really know.
I'm just assuming it's going to be kind of going away at some point very soon.
Breakman in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we tape live on this Sunday evening asks, I thought they were going to heavily market the PSP this year.
Didn't they get a kid to be the face of the PSP?
I haven't seen a PSP commercial in a long time.
Yeah, thank God because he's so fucking annoying.
Well, is that maybe because their big focus this year has been on the move?
That they really want to sell the PlayStation Move?
They are really trying to focus on marketing the PSP, but the stuff that they're focusing on, it's just like catalog titles and, you know, just what small releases that they have coming out.
I mean, what few, or I shouldn't say small, what few releases they have coming out.
I mean, their big marketing campaign is, hey, look, we got these old games that are $10 now.
I mean, that's great, I guess.
You know, these games that have been out for a long time.
I mean, really, do we need to be marketing Mod Nation Racers still?
I mean, that game came out six months ago.
Akuma JP in our chatroom says, Monster Hunter 3rd is big here.
He lives over in Japan, so...
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom says, I'm still wondering when Kingdom Hearts 3 itself will come out.
I believe a lot of that is tied to Final Fantasy XIII Versus.
If I remember right, it's the same team that usually does the Kingdom Hearts games.
Part of the reason Kingdom Hearts 3 has been so unheard of is because Final Fantasy XIII Versus has taken so long.
Next Kingdom Hearts game is also going to be on DS, recoded, so...
Well, then there's the 3DS title, too.
They've got in the works, right?
Yes, there is a 3DS title in the works as well.
I mean, just once the 3DS comes out, I think it's going to be just the final blow for the PSP until they announce the PSP 2.
Then that might pick things up.
Especially with these rumors that it might be the phone as well.
I think it's going to be something separate.
I don't think it's going to be a phone integrated into it.
I can see it's something like the iPod Touch or something where it has many of the features of the phone minus the phone, you know, like the whole marketplace and stuff.
They're probably going to try to emulate a lot of that stuff, but I don't know.
I guess if you have a PSP, you know, neat that they have another update, which will probably be cracked in a few days anyways.
But, I mean, there's not a lot of titles on the horizon for you guys, unfortunately.
But hey, just...
Wait, don't be tempted by some of these Black Friday sales, which I did see they had one as a PSP Go for $150 and it came with three games, including LittleBigPlanet and stuff like that.
So that's kind of cool.
But once again, they're just trying to soccer you in so they can clear out inventory.
And really, do you want a PSP Go when it's at the end of its life cycle?
See, here's the thing, though.
SolarFlare in our chatroom says, I never regret getting my PSP.
And I still think if you don't have a PSP after all this time still, I still think there's a great back catalog of games that are getting cheaper by the day as the console is nearing the end of its life cycle.
I think it's definitely worth looking to go get.
And let's not forget, I've always said, and I think you guys agree, that the PSP's biggest strength is not necessarily its games library, although that's gotten a lot better.
But the fact that the PSP also plays MP3s, does the movies, does the internets, does... That's the problem, though, with the PSP, though, is all that stuff, even nowadays, with the new, like, technology that's out there, with the new smartphones and everything, it's getting really weak.
That's a weak argument now, because before, it was like, hey, yeah, I can, you know, browse the web, and, yeah, the web browser's kind of crappy, it doesn't support a lot of things, you know.
But now, I mean, a lot of the smartphones and stuff that are coming out
That comparison is no longer really valid because everything plays MP3s now.
Everything watches movies.
But if you're a gamer, you can't look at the iPhone games and take any of them seriously.
99% of them suck.
Especially the ones that are bad, bad, bad ports of real games.
That's true, but also 99% of them are under $20.
Hold on, I think Jamie wanted to jump in here.
No, I was just going to say I've been enjoying Final Fantasy 2 and Vi and a lot of games on there.
But I still think Final Fantasy 2 is better on the PSP.
Yes, because it has buttons.
Yes, exactly.
Exactly.
The argument does stand.
But I get it.
You're right.
The price is huge, too.
It's kind of cool, though.
One of the things, actually, I forgot to mention that I did this week as far as my game stuff, because I do have a jailbroken iPod, I downloaded an NES emulator on it, which is kind of neat.
But what's neat about it is you can actually, it has support via Bluetooth to sync a Wii Remote to it to use the Wii Remote to play the NES games on.
just totally random tangent question I want to ask Marissa so she doesn't feel left out here because the Wii is supposed to be that system that gets everybody no matter if you're a gamer or not it's just supposed to reach out to everybody have you ever played the Wii?
Oh yeah, my dad has a Wii and he likes my boyfriend to come over to play Mario with him so we can finally progress in levels.
Now your boyfriend doesn't try to get you to play Wii Fit while he sits behind you with a camera, right?
No, but it was funny, my dad thought that yoga was for wussies.
Oh wait, we're on the internet.
My dad thought yoga was for pussies until he tried the Wii Fit yoga.
Oh, you can say naughty language on the show, it's okay.
The internet is for porn, so why not?
That's right, that's right.
No, I've played the Wii, but I think the interesting thing is that so many games have come out now that's not just the emphasis on the schtick of using the motion control anymore.
Which is what a lot of us wanted in the very beginning, actually.
Like, okay, yay, we get it, there's motion control, now don't go overboard with it.
No, don't, stop, stop, you're getting too close to the edge.
Stop!
Hey, you know, it's better than the, at least the controller's better than the Gamecock, so the PSP.
You know, there was actually a game company called Gamecock.
I don't even know if they're still around.
I think I heard something about them shutting down.
They're terrible.
Didn't they do the Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game?
That was like their big thing.
Anyhow, moving on.
Let's talk about some other gaming news that doesn't have to do with the PSP.
Let's talk about the Kinect.
We were talking about Japanese and the way things were received in Japan a minute ago.
How about the Kinect launch in Japan?
Well, in Japan, Microsoft's new Kinect sold 26,000 units during the launch weekend of November 20th.
That includes both standalone and 360 bundled Kinects.
Now, here's something to keep in mind.
It sold a million of them.
I believe in the rest of the world.
so the fact that it sold 26,000 is actually pretty good considering the user base that exists compared to the rest of the world so there's a million ways you can kind of slice it but regardless that's what it is what I also thought was very interesting especially to a lot of the audience of this show guess what the highest selling launch title was in Japan it was Dance Masters was the highest selling launch title in Japan 6,000 copies of Dance Masters they didn't like their part
Well, keep in mind, they also don't have Dance Central, because Dance Central was a very kind of American type of game, especially when it comes to the licenses.
Being that Dance Masters relied pretty much completely on Konami Originals and Avex songs that I'm sure were dirt cheap to license here in the US, you pretty much have the same game overseas that you have here.
So very interesting the way that worked out.
But that almost sounds to me like
I'm not so sure that Kinect in Japan has that must-have title.
I mean, not to slam on Dance Masters, but I think that a game like Dance Central, maybe localized with J-pop hits and songs that are big in Japan, might do well.
I mean, heck, probably even a lot of the songs that are in it already.
I know there's a lot of the kind of cross-culture going on there.
Probably would do a lot better.
So I don't know, I'm kind of interested.
Does anybody kind of read into those numbers at all?
What do you guys think about those numbers?
Is that a good launch or is that a shitty launch?
Well, they just have a really small install base in Japan, so I'm not surprised that the numbers are a lot smaller than we have over here in the North American regions.
I'd say that's not bad, considering...
So we'll see.
I mean, it's so interesting now kind of where we're at in this generation where, you know, the PlayStation is such the bigger deal over in Japan.
I'd be more curious, and I haven't seen these numbers yet, as to how the move is doing over there compared to here because I bet it's doing better.
It is doing way better than that because there's more of an installed base.
Right.
But is it doing better there than it is here comparatively?
I don't think so.
I'd be curious.
Anyway, that's all I really had.
Kinect launched in Japan and we'll see what games come out over there and what all gets localized for Japan or vice versa, perhaps.
I just actually found something really sad just now.
What's that?
Leslie Nielsen died.
Oh, no!
The guy from Airplane Run?
The Naked Gun?
Yeah.
No!
He was getting really old.
Yeah, but I just happened to look and... That's horrible.
Sad.
That's a bummer.
Yeah, he was funny.
Way to bring down the show.
How about some happy news?
Let's talk about Marissa's boobs some more.
That'll cheer me up.
So, Marissa... No, I'm kidding.
I can see your dirty pillows.
Well, Eidos kind of got sucked into Square Enix.
Because, you know, Tomb Raider is still getting cranked out, but it's now by Square Enix.
And actually, the last arcade game they did, anyway, was really good.
So, you know, there's always hope.
Cross those fingers.
How about Something Happy?
How about Something Happy?
Well, BBC America is having programming available on PlayStation Network.
There will be the first episode of the U.S.
version of Top Gear, which is normally $1.99 SD or $2.99 HD.
And that's going to be up there for the first two weeks for free.
And Dan said it was actually really good.
He's a big Top Gear fan, so he said it was really up there.
It gets the Dan stamp of approval.
It gets the Dan stamp of approval.
Very nice.
Also, Doctor Who and Being Human will be up there on the launch list.
I'm sure everyone's heard me go off about Doctor Who, about how awesome it is, but Being Human is a really, really cool show.
It sounds kind of cheesy about a werewolf and his vampire friend moving into a flat that happens to be haunted by this girl that was killed there.
So yeah, a werewolf, a ghost, and a vampire live together.
Walk into a bar?
No.
But actually, it's a really good drama.
I actually really like it.
So it's one I recommend to people to watch.
But they're going to be adding more BBC shows on there.
I'm hoping to see Primeval show up.
That's another good show.
That's really cool.
That makes me happy.
That means that I actually have a reason to use my PlayStation store since I don't have cable.
Just cable internets.
Then again, I also have the internet.
Shh.
We're not supposed to be encouraging that here on this program.
What are you talking about?
I just watched streaming BBC TV.
There you go.
I'm telling you what not to do.
So the chat room is kind of reacting to the whole news about Leslie Nielsen.
He was 84 years old.
I didn't realize he was that old.
I'm telling you, he was old.
He was at least 60 when those Naked Gun movies came out in the 90s.
But he didn't age ever.
Ezam in our chatroom says, Happy news.
Leslie Nielsen is now a zombie and there's a new naked gun in the works.
So there you go.
Oh, that's... It'll probably be funnier than the last one.
The only movie I think he's done that I really didn't care for was Dracula Dead and Loving It, which is also sad because it was a Mel Brooks movie too and it wasn't all that good.
I can't say that there was a movie that he did that I did not like.
Say maybe Mr. Magoo.

Connect support is coming to the X and A in the future.
Apparently, developers will be getting the tools to make games supporting the Connect.
Just not right now.
They said that they're pleased to see developers tinkering around with, to a degree, the device.
And, of course...
They're saying that Microsoft classifies as someone accessing algorithms on the side of the Xbox for ill use or someone explaining the Kinect in a cheating manner not tolerable.
Of course, they're saying creating a driver that might open the USB connection or read C inputs from the sensor, on the other hand, are totally cool at Microsoft.
They're kind of referring to some of the homebrew hacks people have done on their PC.
And they said they have no timetable when Kinect support will come to the XNA, but it possibly will.
I imagine they will at some point.
They're going to want people taking advantage of their peripherals.
They'll be like saying, you know...
We're not really going to give you the algorithms and the device drivers to use our controllers.
But you can make games.
You just can't have anything to control them.
You know, maybe they're afraid that the indie developers are going to make better games than what's out there right now.
That wouldn't be that difficult.
When you open it up to the public, there's going to be all those ideas.
And there's going to be somebody that thinks it's something that the publishers have been too afraid to do.
And they're going to come up with that must-have game.
You know what I mean?
So...
Which reminds me, we actually need to do something a little bit out of order and out of character here on Orange Lingerie, but I need to go to the Twitters real quick.
I'm actually going to Twitter topics a little bit early in the show.
I'm not going to do them all, but there's one particular Twitter that caught my attention before the show tonight, and it has to do with XNA and all this stuff.
So I'm going to the Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and I want to read some tweets from Blue Swim.
Hey, you ready?
Okay.
BlueSwim had asked us a question on Twitter.
Have any of you played the Xbox Live indie game Techno Kitten Adventure?
Kitten plus jetpack plus club music plus rainbows plus pink ponies equals win.
And he actually sent us a little YouTube here of what the game in motion looks like.
And of course, that doesn't make for great radio.
But just to give you an idea, here's what the soundtrack sounds like.
Now, to tell you what's going on, in the game, there's a little kitten on a jetpack flying through different obstacles, and he's dodging these pink unicorns that are flying at him, and these UFOs, and falling stars, which are referenced in the song, if you listen to the lyrics of the song, and these little boats with colored tracks.
I don't think he actually has to dodge all that.
I think it's just the blocks he has to dodge.
The rest is just background music.
This is kind of like Robot Unicorn Attack, but like 10 times more awesome!
I like the stars.
And whenever he crashes into objects, he goes, meow.
Look at the high scores.
It's like a bad, like, was it YTMD or something?
If you were high, this game would just make you pass out.
Like, seriously.
I just don't even know.
So, my point is, this is quite possibly the most amazing thing I've ever seen someone do on the Xbox 360.
And it's on the indie market.
In fact, I've decided we are going to track this guy down and get him on the show, whoever made this game, because I need to know more about this right now.
Right now.
Obviously, the publishers and the big activisions and EAs of the world are too afraid of Techno Kitten Adventure.
And getting their, you know, multi-millions from, I'm sure, what this is going to sell on the indie marketplace.
Amazing.
Techno Kitten Adventure.
There you go.
Damn, that was amazing.
Thank you to Blue Swim for pointing that out.
I am immediately going home and buying that after the show, just so you know.
I will too, buy that.
Look at that, look at that.
You just sold two copies off that game, and how hard could that game have possibly been to make?
And I haven't bought anything off of X and A for a long time.
But it was an idea that no one else had thought of yet, or was too afraid to do.
Meow.
I don't know.
Meow.
And I welcome the sequel.
That game scared Shermie out of the room.
Did it?
The chatters are like, what is this?
Link now.
Send us a link.
Here you go.
I'll give you the same link Blue Swim gave me.
There you go.
I'll put watch now.
There you go.
I just put that there.
Azam in the chat says, President Jetpack Cat.
Actdeft says, we have our new President Cat and it has a jetpack.
Orange Right says, Jetpack Cat.
Sure.
We endorse this.
Jetpack Cat.
President Cat's Cousin.
In fact, I will make a tweet right now.
Right now.
President Cat's Cousin, Jetpack Cat, you must get this game right now.
There you go.
Some indie guy is going to be like, WTF?
All right, anyhow, let me get into another story here.
And there's a link right there in chat, Alphina, Canandagram, because now you can, of course, set everything up to download.
Thank you.
See, you know what's funny is that half our listeners are going to buy it tonight, and then the guy's going to go in like,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But whatever, Sony seems to think that 3D is the place to be But wait, did you see the box art?
No I didn't
Can you try to describe the box art because it is a radio show?
The box art is of a little kitten staring up at something that looks really fucking trippy and it's awesome.
And of course, their little description, it says, Navigate a kitten by jetpack fueled by hopes and dreams through a fantastical world of techno music.
I want him on our show.
Who made this game?
I want him on the show next week or her.
Whoever.
Featuring DJ Hixie, Sea of Love, Frisco, all around the world, Productions Limited.
Who made this game?
Bring them to me.
OL Army, find me this person and bring them to me.
Mono X. Mono X. Marissa's laughing over there.
She's dying.
You all right?
That's awesome.
I'm going to submit this image of the box art to our image feed there.
Fueled by hopes and dreams.
Blue Swim, if this is a friend of yours, I want them on the show now.
Bring them to me.
All right.
Maybe bathe him and bring him to me.
He is being summoned to our castle.
All right.
All right.
Sony, 3D, whatever
20 games internally at Sony alone are going to be converted for the 3D TV a quote here from Mick Hocking with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe overall we have more than 50 titles currently being converted into 3D and this number is growing fast some of them are massive names that's a really really good sign that the industry is behind our unique message that 3D is a key element in the future of home consoles
is it just me or do I kind of read that as well you know the 3DS everybody's got a boner about so 3D must be the future is that kind of I don't know maybe that's just what I read and this would be Sony saying this yeah Mick Hawking with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe that's odd that they would think that 3D is the future of entertainment
because Sony makes 3D TVs.
Imagine that.
That's so crazy in that they would have 3D Blu-rays that they'd be pushing for their console.
Yeah, biased much?
By the way, over 50 3D games in development overall.
20 of them are just the internals there at Sony.
So 3D is the wave of the future, everybody.
There you go.
I have officially purchased Technokitten Adventure.
I need to make the tweet about that, but I've been reading the news, so I need DarkSakura to do a new story so I can go to the Twitters.
Well, how about something about Piece of Shit 14?
I mean, Final Fantasy 14.
It looks like they're actually going to be doing an update to it.
It's going to be fixing the skill point allocation, UI response time, more accessible user interface.
There's actually a lot of stuff up on their official website.
But basically, everyone said, it's crap!
So, the Square Enix VP of Software Development, Hiromichi Tanaka said, The development team is working really hard to bring it back to the level we plan to have ready for the players.
Yeah, in fact, there's a whole bunch of updates ready for it.
According to the site, and I'm trying to pull all the information up...
More tutorials, more stuff to some of the scenarios.
Yes, no confirmation prompt when you're selecting a path companion.
Difficulties have been adjusted.
Lots of stuff.
Let me know if it's less crappy, people.
Do they patch in fun?
Is fun in one of the bullet points?
There's one that says collecting seashells.
Well, that sounds kind of stupid.
Maximum HP has been increased.
What about kittens with jetpacks?
Do we have any of those yet?
Let me see kittens, kittens, kittens.
Hey, man, I got a game idea, man.
You won't believe this.
Kittens, jetpacks.
Nothing about kittens.
Nothing about kittens, Rob.
Fail!
Fail.
Well, actually, though, Final Fantasy does have the Mithra, or whatever they're calling them now in Final Fantasy XIV.
Maybe they changed the name to Mazithra.
I don't know.
But the kitten people, the cat people.
Isn't Mazithra like a pasta or something like that?
It's kind of cheese.
It's my favorite dish.
It's my favorite dish at the old spaghetti factory.
Mazithra con gusto, actually.
Oh my god, we were talking about that before the show.
Favorite dish.
I hope your boyfriend isn't listening because you might get that line when you get home.
It's time for Mazithra Congusto.
He's long hair, Chris.
Sorry, boys.
She's taken.
Anyhow.
Let's move on.
Talk about some release dates of other games that are coming out around the world.
And we'll start off in the U.S.
Although things are starting to slow down a little bit, right?
That would be correct.
Not a lot this week.
And thankfully not a lot of crappy games I can talk about.
But there's a few.
So we'll talk about Chevrolet Camaro Wild Ride, which I'm sure is awesome.
That's coming out on the Wii.
Deadliest Catch Sea of Chaos coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
And you better believe it, the Xbox 360 will be supporting the Kinect and the PS3, the Move.
Sniper Elite on the Nintendo Wii.
Let's see here.
A game called Nailed.
That's supposed to be a pretty awesome ATV off-road racing game.
That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
Epic Mickey on the Wii.
A game called Spellforce 2.
Faith in Destiny.
That's on PC.
And Golden Sun, Dark Dawn.
Coming out on DS this week.
And that is it.
Oh, there's still some big titles in there.
I thought Epic Mickey had already come out.
No, it came out this week.
Oh, okay.
And it's epic.
Oh, and it looks like Hello Kitty Seasons was delayed another week.
That is now coming out this week.
Yippee skippee.
All right, let's go over to Japan.
Oh, and I'm sorry, real quick.
No, you're done.
This isn't a game, but the wireless pro guitar for the Wii is coming out this week.
All right.
All right, moving on to Japan and the Japanese release dates.
Things are slowing down a tad over there as well, but there are still some games.
Battlefield Bad Company 2 gets the Ultimate Edition.
That's the Japanese version, not an import.
That comes out in Japan this week.
December 2nd, also going on to the PlayStation 3.
There's a few games on there.
There's Battlefield Battle Company there.
Dante's Inferno gets a price reduction, so does Killzone 2.
Hokuto Musou International comes out this week, as well as Fusa Sareta Shibuya Day.
That's a price reduction as well.
A new game called Tales of Graces F, that's from Namco Bandai, comes out this week.
I'm assuming that is in the Tales of Graces series.
Oh, it was a Wii game, originally.
And they're saying it's not just a port, it actually expands the world and adds a whole new epilogue to the game.
So, neat.
On other platforms, this week in Japan, looking at the Nintendo Wii, trying to see if there's anything, just Taiko no Tatsujin, some of our music game fans like that game, Mina de Party comes out this week, Naruto Shippuden, Gekkoutou Ninja Taisen Special comes out this week, and Babysitter Mama,
is a big release this week in Japan.
Outro Music
I'm sorry, but in this screenshot in the game, is she throwing a baby?
Like, what is happening in this picture?
There's like some type of like, throw the Wiimote this way.
It's like baby tossing into a hot frying pan or something.
Is she cooking the baby?
It's a liver, a nice candy.
I'm going to put that in our chat room.
You come up with your own opinions.
I'm sorry.
It looks like she's throwing the baby into a pot.
Do not throw the baby.
What are they teaching the kids over there in Japan?
All right, at All Serious is some other games on the Sony PSP this week.
Kamen Rider Climax Heroes 000.
Ooh.
That's really the name of the game.
Kamen Rider Climax Heroes.
Ooh.
Climax Heroes.
Ooh.
Riders from Cougar to Oz.
Cougar.
Breaks through the boundaries that separates their series in this game.
It's a fighting game.
And it's powered up the men with more skills.
LocoRoco 2 gets a price reduction on the PSP.
That's it.
I'm spent.
That's it for releases this week in Japan.
How about UK?
Ace Combat 11 Skies of Incursion, BlazBlue Continuum Shift, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition, and the Sly Collection.
That's about it.
A few biggies.
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
But first, Loki.
By the way, I found a way to contact the guy.
Did you?
Yes.
All right.
We'll get to that later.
We'll talk offline.
Yes.
Okay.
So, fun stuff.
This is kind of neat.
CD Projekt, and that's spelled P-R-O-J-E-K-T, like Jekt, as in Final Fantasy X.
Um, they're fighting Witcher 2 piracy with a threat of a fine.
That's right, there's not going to be any DRM in the actual title, but if they find out that you're pirating the game, they're going to hunt you down.
We are signing with legal firms and torrent sneaking companies to hunt down gamers who download The Witcher 2 unlawfully.
Such offenders will be sent a letter demanding they pay a fine, the sum of which was left unspecified, though it sounds they'll be more than the game's suggested retail price.
And it says, we don't want to be harsh, but there's a chance that this might happen to some people if they download it illegally.
Or in other words, I guess, don't make them mad.
So is this like policing through fear?
Or what exactly is the deal?
It sounds like it.
Honestly, though, I don't think that they're going to be able to follow through with this.
You know what I mean?
It's a cute picture.
I don't know.
I thought that's why you sent it to me.
Oh, no, it's fine.
It's fine.
It seems like an awful lot.
Considering that as soon as this gets pirated, it's going to be all over the place.
It's going to be a little hard to track down every single person that's downloaded it.
I'd say it's more of an empty thread if you ask me.
They may try, but...
Or they'll make an example of one.
Like they did that one chick that was in Wisconsin or whatever that, you know, some mom that they took to court over some crappy songs that she downloaded and they want to put her through the ringer for like $2 million or whatever it is.
You know, crazy.
Well, just here's what you do.
You just don't download it on a torrent site because they get you for sharing and so therefore, you know, you're, you know...
I guess pirating stuff or you're sharing it with other people so they can claim a loss that's more than the retail copy of the game but if you download it like a direct download or something like that really they're only losing one copy so it'd be a harder argument for them and I don't think they can really track you that well and who really gives a crap about The Witcher 2 anyways that's my opinion
Did a pic of Marissa's boobs go up on the internet or something?
Because I just noticed the chat.
I thought that she sent me the picture for the sake of showing the listeners.
But it was for your private collection.
It is not the entire boobs.
I thought it would be a good promo for the afterbirth.
Watch the whole show.
Hang out for the boobs.
Ranma says, God damn, those are some tig old biddies.
They actually look bigger because of the way I'm posing that photo.
Just let them believe whatever they want.
Let them believe whatever they want.
Don't get rid of their hope!
It does suck when you wake up in the morning and you hit yourself in the face, but...
You know what, though?
Despite all the fun we're having, sometimes the tickle bitties can kind of be a pain in the ass.
Like, it's not all fun and games.
Pain in the ass?
More like a pain in the back.
Yes, exactly.
All right.
Anyhow, do we mention she's a musician as well?
And you should buy her music if you're going to like be all like boobies.
All right.
Anyhow.
No, I actually this is a kind of a serious story.
And this this kind of shit just makes me so angry.
I want to talk about this for a minute because this is serious.
So less titties, more serious.
This is about something going on in Call of Duty's Black Ops.
And
I guess, and again, these are not usually the type of games I play, but I guess there is a mode where you can design your own logos, and these logos will kind of go on the uniforms of the people that you are controlling.
Well, of course, give a guy a...
PEN AND PAPER
doesn't find it funny at all and says, quote, it's not political correctness, it's fundamental respect.
If you think the swastika symbol should be reevaluated by societies all over the earth, I think that's great.
Your Xbox Live profile or in-game logo, which doesn't have the context to explain your goal, is not the right place to do that.
And by the way, that doesn't just go for the swastika, it applies to many other symbols as well that my team does indeed take action on when we see it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
uh uh uh
you are on a private network and part of the terms of service is don't be a douchebag and I'm sorry but if you're putting this logo you're only doing it to provoke a reaction of some sort you're just trying to be a douchebag there's really no nice way to say it you're just trying to cause a little controversy and be a douchebag can't you just play the fucking game like seriously like why do people have to just be dicks you know draw a penis
Penises aren't offensive.
Draw a cunt if that makes you feel better.
Draw Marissa's boobies if you want.
That's not offensive at all.
I can't believe though in Call of Duty already they've managed to black ops everything is a dick or my boyfriend's icon is humping bunnies and yeah it's just ever since you know prehistoric times you see ancient cave paintings of penises that just continues to this day there you go so you know what especially in a war game it's just unappropriate thank you very much he-man stuff
Actdeft in our chatroom says, Don't be a douchebag should really be there.
Textual in the terms of service.
You know what I say.
I'm not offended by the symbol itself.
It's been used in many cultures.
It's a good luck charm in many of them.
It's on American architecture from before 1942.
But when you have it up there in black on a white background with red around it,
That's saying something, and that's offensive.
Especially in the context of a war game.
Exactly.
It's like, you know what you're doing.
And I'm sure there's these guys, what about my freedom of speech?
It's just a symbol.
You go on the street and yell whatever you want.
You agree to the terms you play by them.
Exactly.
You know what?
If you want to display whatever you want to, then you can do it without their service.
You don't have to pay for it.
You know, here's the thing.
If you are the type of person that just feels this need to provoke people with the symbol, why don't you stop hiding behind your Xbox and why don't you go out onto the street and yell, I love Hitler and see what happens to you?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I just think it's ironic that people that are usually supposed to be the example of white supremacy aren't really good examples, and people you never want to fuck anyway, so.
Yeah.
It's just the most, I always think of the Greg Probst bit, the white race is a superior race.
It's like most homophobes I meet are usually like, well, I don't like gay guys because, you know, they all want to put it in my butt.
Really?
Yeah.
Don't flatter yourself.
Yeah, exactly.
You're like not even on the list.
You're not in the top 20.
You know what?
You're not even in the top 9 million, actually.
In fact, there is no list that you're on whatsoever.
So just don't flatter yourself.
Exactly.
And you know what?
And honestly, if a guy did happen to hit on you, I have to say, not interested.
Yeah.
Usually, that'll say, well, I'm not interested.
You know what it is?
I think all of hate comes back to?
Insecurity.
Don't you think?
Absolutely.
And so these people who think, oh, well, I'm going to bring attention to myself by using something that I know is going to offend people and I'm going to do all this shock value.
All it's doing is just making you look like a douche.
Give me attention!
Well, this is what I would like.
And I'm sorry for getting a little ranty on this.
No, it's okay.
I think that, and I have the same opinion towards cussing, by the way.
We needed some good controversy tonight, so... I think that by bringing... The more people make a big deal out of something, you know what I mean?
I mean, about certain things.
The more power they're actually giving to it as opposed to what should be happening, and that's taking the power out of it.
That's taking the fear out of an object, you know what I mean?
Taking...
And I understand that you don't want to ever forget what happened, what brought these about.
But at the same time, you don't want to keep giving people the power to hurt you with whatever means they want to.
And I think it's very good that they're going to ban the use on Xbox Live.
That's good.
But I do at the same time think that that's just also giving a little bit more fuel to...
and, you know, I'm trying to see how to phrase this right because I believe they were right.
I'm 100% behind that.
I think that's good.
Thank you for taking a stand.
I think that's really good.
But at the same time, I think that that's just lighting a little bit more fire under their butts and starting more controversy by going out and making a big statement about it.
I just think the band should have been quiet.
Does that make sense?
No, it does.
Ban it, but don't go out and do a press statement saying, oh, we're banning it.
Here's your cookie.
Haters gonna hate, man.
That's it.
Haters gonna hate.
Hey, that's my line.
Why make a big deal out of the haters when you can just, you know, if they protest it, send them an email, you've been banned for this, this, and this.
I will say this.
It wasn't quite a press release.
Just so you know, the guy who is with Xbox runs a personal blog, and he addressed this issue in his personal blog, which the game blogs picked up because he happens to have that position.
So just to be fair, it is not a press release.
It was his personal blog, where I think that's actually kind of neat that he touches on these touchy subjects in his personal blog, where maybe he can't say it in a press release.
That I'm better with.
I mean, but if it had been out like a press release, that's just, you know, it's sort of like, you know, when a little kid, you tell them they can't do something and they want to do it even more because you tell them that they can't do it.
here's a direct quote from the dude's blog and I love this because it's the TLDR too long didn't read at the end if you see offensive symbols in Call of Duty Black Ops report them using the in-game option and they will be taken care of if you want to argue that swastikas are actually awesome go to another forum on Xbox Live they are not allowed happy face
I agree with that.
I agree.
Because it's just making them think it's all the better to do.
Oh, it's pushing buttons.
Let's do it some more.
I could get into this whole other topic.
Obviously, you have a lot of passion on a lot of these types of issues because of your recent conversion to Judaism.
I have a lot of passion on the homophobia issues.
And I could get into this whole thing about the whole, like, I don't agree with trying to drag people out of the closet.
But that's for another episode when that's the topic.
But there's always different perspectives.
I just think people just need to get over themselves.
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
The classic game of the week is Smash TV!
Yes, we're going to blow shit up this Classic Game of the Week.
Awesome.
Skip up a little bit.
Skip up a little bit.
Smash TV was made in 1990.
It was William's game.
Mark Tramiel was one of the people behind it.
He, of course, gave us Mortal Kombat.
Any big surprise there?
It was published by Acclaim for the home systems.
And basically, it is based off of... The other creator was Eugene Jarvis.
It was based off of his game Robotron 2084.
So it's got a dual joystick control.
and it's sort of taking elements from The Running Man where basically you're on a violent video game show you're on a violent game show it's set in 1999 and basically you have to run around and shoot people who are trying to kill you and you get power-ups and weapons and bonus prizes and it has a game show host who has the best lines ever I'd buy that for a dollar
Big money, big prizes.
I love it.
Exactly.
And actually, the I'd buy that for a dollar was from a comic in Robocop.
Wow, nice.
Yeah.
Thank you for watching!
Um, it's come out on the NES, the SNES as Super Smash TV, on the Game Gear, the Genesis slash Master System slash Mega Drive as Super Smash TV.
Um, you actually can use, on the NES, you can use the directional pad on the second controller to, uh, control where you're shooting.
Um, you have to use the multi-tap though to get that done.
It also came out, it was produced by Ocean for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Commodore Amiga in 1992.
I actually had no idea it was on the Commodore 64.
I thought I had every game.
Oh, Rob failed.
I know.
It came out in 1999 as part of the Arcade Party Pack that came out on PlayStation, which is, I do believe, where the clip that I sent you came from.
It was on Midway Arcade Treasures, which is on PC, GameCube, Xbox, PS2.
And they will save your high scores.
You can get it on the Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360.
It's 400 Microsoft points.
But I think that they've actually taken the purchase off.
But yeah, the creators had said that they were considering a Smash TV 2.
So that's pretty interesting.
But anyway, the game's fun.
Dan was actually, I mentioned it on the show before, but his buddy Eric was over here, and Eric had never played Smash TV.
So Dan's like, edumacation!
DJ Dark Knight in our chatroom asks, wasn't the host the final boss?
I never got that far like I said I remember your husband has like the achievements on Xbox Live for like the really uber stuff that's like oh my god how does he do it yeah it's a hard game yeah no Dan Dan's really good at and he used to play it all the time from what I remember him saying and you can I say something else you're speaking of Dan sure tomorrow is his birthday oh he's gonna be years old 21 that's good to know
35.
Okay.
And I love my sweetie.
So I dedicate this classic game of the week to my boy, to my Dan-chan.
Shut up!
No, that's cute.
He's not even here to hear it, the jerk!
You'll have to play it back for him.
Hearts.
There you go.
Happy birthday, Dan.
Happy birthday, Dan!
Hippo birdies.
Hippo birdies?
Hippo birdies to yous.
Oh, okay.
Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.
Come on back for part B. There's plenty more to come tonight, including the rest of your Twitter topics, of which there's quite a few tonight.
A lot of rapid news tonight.
Some mailbag stuff.
Get in your emails if you haven't gotten them in yet.
Some news about new Castlevania download content.
Maybe a game if I have time to write questions.
Maybe.
We're running a little bit long tonight, though, so we'll see.
I kind of want to take a lot of calls if we can, so we might push the game around.
We'll see.
We will be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back.
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
We are taping live on this Sunday evening as we do every week at allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
It is episode number 391 of our show for November the 28th of 2010.
We are joined here tonight with our special guest Marissa, Marissa Congusto with the busto.
But we do love her.
And she likes her old school adventure games.
You know, she might not be much of a hardcore gamer, but she definitely has an appreciation for what King's Quest you were saying.
What's your favorite King's Quest game?
You know what?
Say four, say four, say four.
Because that was my favorite.
I'm losing track of the numbers even though I just played them the other day.
The one with the really annoying owl.
I know that sounds like I don't know the game, but I adored that game.
Oh, good game!
That sounds like five.
I think that's five, yeah.
And that's sad that I know that, but I think that might be five.
Sorry, I'm having a blonde moment mixing up my numbers.
It's all good.
Space Quest I also loved, and of course Salmon Max.
There you go, there you go.
Yeah.
I'm doing a search for King's Quest Annoying Owl and it was King's Quest 5.
Oh, yes.
Have you previously played King's Quest 5?
No.
Every goddamn game.
So you were just a Sierra fangirl, basically.
I really was.
I loved Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.
And LucasArts.
That was an awesome game.
And it's desktop adventures.
What the fuck?
The Annoying Owl
Crazy, crazy.
Huge week in World of Warcraft.
We had a jumbo podcast this week.
It's called Horde House.
That's how you found it on Twitter.
Well, yeah, it's on Twitter, but also iTunes.
H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E.
The best little Horde House in Azeroth.
Myself and Extra were talking about Warcraft.
And DarkSakura has a comic book podcast that she hosts with some friends.
A comic book podcast.
A comic-ass podcast.
It's called Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y.
And we record on Sunday in the mornings and we go up on Tuesday.
And we're an excellent little podcast involving me and Mar and Marvel, or Tiara, and Dan Shadow.
And we talk about comics.
Today was mostly talking about Star Trek.
One of these days we need to get Worlds to collide and we need to get Tiara, Dan, and Extifer all on a show and just see what happens.
World of Warcraft.
It would be fun.
Oh yeah, I would just revert to World of Warcraft talk because they play WoW, huh?
Yeah, meanwhile I'm the one with taste that plays Star Trek Online.
We need to get them on Horde House.
I did make Vice Admiral, by the way.
Congratulations.
I can't rank anymore.
I leveled a priest to 24 in like three days.
Good.
I'm now on my Klingon character who's not actually Klingon.
Alright, let's get back into some rapid fire news.
Loki's just like, I don't have a spinoff show.
I have a baby.
Thanks for watching!
It was named after a soda.
Shut up.
You mixed video game music live on air.
You actually had turntables and maybe like nine people listened because it was on a Friday night.
It was so underappreciated, but you did such an awesome job.
If there's still MP3s of that show floating around, people should try to find them.
This is a great show.
I have all of them.
Uh, yeah, so, rapid fire news, um, the VGA is right around the corner, and of course with the Video Game Awards shows that are on, um, Spike, they of course show some new trailers for games that haven't been announced yet, and one of those trailers is being teased right now, and of course, um, no one knows exactly what it is, but yeah, we know exactly what it is.
Um, apparently the game is going to be a new Resident Evil game.
The way we know that is because apparently a while back they made a Resident Evil t-shirt with the exact same silhouettes of the zombies that are featured in the teaser.
Oopsie.
So yes, it's a new Resident Evil game.
Wow, that is recycled artwork if I've ever seen it before.
I mean, it's hard to convey on the radio, but Loki's looking at a side-by-side comparison.
This is also the same zombie just flipped.
That or someone just flat-out stole from someone else, which would also be hilarious if it didn't end up being Resident Evil at this point.
But there's another image or whatever that says, you know, stay alert, stay alive, report symptoms.
And it has a Biohazard logo on it.
So, you know, Biohazard, Resident Evil.
It's not a stretch.
I mean, come on.
Sequel to successful game franchise?
No.
So, yeah.
Expect a new Resident Evil game to be announced.
Um, it's kind of fun.
With the new firmware that came out for, or I should say the new dashboard for the Xbox 360, there was a new, they were calling it the AP 2.5 protection that was supposed to flag consoles as being banned, or flag them if you were playing a burnt game or whatever on modified drives.
Well...
Apparently, not, what, a couple weeks after the firmware or the new dashboard came out, they have already found a way around it.
And they've actually come it over forever.
The custom firmware group has released new firmwares for iXtreme LT+, for Lino and BenQ drives for the Xbox 360.
It allows...
It says, Defeats current AP-25 protection, protects consoles from logging AP-25 violations, full disc stealth, and yadda yadda yadda.
Basically, it means that they've found a way past their
New, uh, I don't know if it's supposed to be undefeatable, but, um, new copy protection.
Didn't take very long, so.
Interesting.
Um, and then, finally, and this is kind of neat, uh, we were talking a little bit about, I should say, uh, Rob was talking about how he likes Super Meat Boy, and I was asking him about, um, you know, the internets, uh, t-internets.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and also two non-character specific DLC packs will arrive via internets in December.
Meat Boy, a retro chapter based on the best of Meat Boy Flash prototype and iMeat Boy, a pack of remixed levels from the main game made more difficult.
Yes, that's right.
They're taking levels from the game and making them even more difficult than they were.
They already have the Dark World and the Light World.
Well, now they're even more difficult.
Darker World or what?
Like, yeah, every level in the game, if you get an A+, meaning you clear it under the par time, then there's a Dark World version that's just even meaner.
Because some of those levels, like the Light World levels, like, some of them were really hard.
Like, I almost cried.
Just ask SalaciousPop, he laughed the whole time.
And Rob, I guess to internets, I'm trying to see how you would access them.
It says there's a level called to internets.
It's a world that can and will be automatically updated with free level packs using the title managed storage system.
I probably just haven't dug around enough in the game.
There's a lot in there.
Yeah, but they have this cool little path or whatever that they have, a bunch of different levels.
Yeah, most of the worlds have that, but it looks like the background's a little different.
I wonder if there's warp zones and stuff, too, because some of the warp zone retro stuff is the hilarious stuff.
Yeah.
DarkToicAk in our chatroom says, I'm sorry, but Super Meat Boy really sounds like a porno.
Oh, that's what it is?
Like, it...
It's the worst title and some of the worst cover art I've ever seen, but the game is amazing.
To get the internets, you have to obtain 20 bandages.
Oh, I'm really terrible, you guys.
I have like four bandages.
So I'll work on that.
That makes sense.
Alfred Cananogram is echoing that in the chatroom.
Alright, I'll work on that.
I'll work on getting 20 bandages.
Guys, it is a really hard game, okay?
That's all I'm saying.
DJ Tiesto 3 Track Pack for DJ Hero 2
DJ Hero 2 DLC sounds like...
I think electronic music is very cool.
I don't want to hear the guy talking.
I just wanted to hear some music.
So, there you go.
The DJ Hero one is a little bit harder to find.
I believe it's mycookrewards.com slash rewards slash dj-hero- I have TFs spelled wrong.
DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto
Well, fuck.
TigerClaw wanted to know what songs for Tiesto.
Traffic mixed with Louder Than Boom.
The Feel It In My Bones song he did with Tegan and Sarah, which I actually really like that song.
It's a cool song.
And Knock You Out featuring Emily Haynes mixed with Young Lions.
Those are the songs.
Bulletproof Heart, Helena, Teenagers, and Welcome to the Black Parade.
And they will become paid DLC once that expires.
So even if you don't own the game, just download, get the code, and then that way you have it for when you do buy the game.
Those are actually songs that I would really like because I've got the ones that they did for Rock Band and I wanted more.
Helena is such a great song.
It'd be really fun to have.
Now, going on to another news story.
I am so confused by this next story.
This is just so crazy.
Alright, Game Room, right?
It was kind of neat when it first came out, and then the games that have been released for it have been kind of bleh.
And then, you know, Chrome has been having problems, and so we've all just kind of written off Game Room, right?
Well, did you hear what games came out on Game Room this week?
If you missed it, Game Pack 12 has...
The arcade version of Blades of Steel Trick Trap 1771 Pitfall 2 on the Atari 2600 Which by the way is my favorite 2600 game ever made And the Intellivision's Vectron Now some of the game room people You can go in on the PC version and kind of see what games are going to be coming out soon Get this, you know what else is in the pack?
Amidar, Food Fight, Puyan, Sunset Riders
from Konami, and DarkSakura, Twinbee is in this pack.
Right?
So, I'm sitting here going, you're putting this out now?
You waited until now to give us this stuff?
Like, when everybody was declaring, ah, Game Room's a bore.
You waited until now to whip out Sunset Riders.
Twinbee!
and, yeah, Twinby, whatever.
TWINBY!
Like, I don't even understand the idea behind that or what.
That's, oh my gosh.
And Blades of Steel?
Like, the best hockey game ever made?
Arcade version, nonetheless, which I bet a lot of people haven't even played because we all just remember the NES version.
Yeah, so if you haven't been on Game Room in a while, now you have reason to go check it out again.
Like, seriously.
Surely one of those games made you go, what, what, what?
And yeah, the pricing is still the same.
It's what, $3 on one platform?
$5 on both?
Crazy.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I have to leave on Tuesday morning.
Ah, shit.
If I didn't have this whole work thing tomorrow, I'd be like, I'm bringing Dance Central over and we're playing Whoop, there it is.
Come down for Tron, you can crash on my floor.
I wish I could make it work.
We'll see, we'll see.
You can sleep in Chris's gamer chair.
And then Black Eyed Peas.
The one that makes the creepy noises.
Yeah, it makes creepy noises at night when the temperature changes.
It's haunted chair.
If you actually like the Black Eyed Peas, I Got a Feelin' is coming out.
David Guetta did kind of help with that track and he's cool, so I'll give it that.
There you go, that's your Dance Central DLC.
DarkSakura?
Well, we have some other stuff.
For the consoles, there is on Capcom's official Japanese language blog, there are screens of Yun and Yang in their arranged costumes.
So instead of their little kind of street-y looking fun outfits, they are dressed as a chef and a waiter.
And, yeah, chef and a waiter.
So that should be cool.
Apparently there's going to be achievements open for both of the characters as well.
And rumors of an evil Ryu, a grain of salt territory, and some other stuff.
Also, for those waiting for Otomedius Excellent, it's not going to be out until... Looks like spring 2011, not fall 2010 like they originally said.
So they say it's a delay in production.
More games getting delayed.
Same story every week.
I hope it's for a good reason.
I hope it's for a good reason.
And finally, Doctor Who Mazes of Time will be out for the iPhone and iPad.
Actually for the holiday season.
I hope that's going to be in the US as well.
But basically, it's being put out by Tag that's done other apps for different Channel 4 shows in the UK.
Come Dine With Me and Peep Show.
So, maybe that'll be cool.
Alright, are we ready to get to some Twitter topics and get to the tweets that people have been tweeting us all night?
We ready?
Yes, let's.
We already know that it's a great Twitter tonight because of the whole Jetpack Cat thing that's been going on, so very excited about that.
Yes, we did start a new hashtag.
We're hoping you'll catch on.
Alright, anyhow, for now...
I don't even know if I've heard of that second game.
Donkey Kong Country Returns, not yet.
The second one's kind of a little bit like that last Guardian game.
You have this kind of golem...
Thank you for watching!
Sorry, I'm looking at a little... Wow, that's really stylistic.
Is that on an arcade or is that like an actual retail game?
That's a retail game.
That looks kind of awesome, actually.
The problem is these games are $60.
You know what I mean?
That game is $40.
Really?
Yes.
This actually looks kind of awesome.
And if you shopped on Amazon, you could have gotten it for $30.
Really?
Really?
M.A.J.I.N.
Donkey Kong Returns, I'm kind of like, eh.
My Wii is still in a box, and this game does not really motivate me to get it out of the box.
You put your Wii in a box?
My Wii in a box?
All right, Spazinator PSN says, if I can get through tonight on the phone, I'll call in giving a mini review of Voodoo on the PS3.
What's Voodoo?
V-U-D-U?
It's a movie streaming service.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Oh, okay, so it's like a Netflix competitor type thing?
something like that I guess now here's why I like having a live chat room because when we're sitting here going I don't know the game I've never played the game our chatters help fill in the gaps here so Miklatov in our chat room says Donkey Kong Returns is hard as hell and Solar Flare says Donkey Kong Returns is only fun with a group of friends and booze there you go
Deathwishing says Rob should dust off his PS3 because Konami Space on Home has DDR in it.
So they brought DDR to PlayStation Home now, I guess?
I'll look at it.
I haven't played the PS3 in a while, but I'll take a look.
It's not that I hate the PS3, it's just there haven't been a lot of games on it I've been wanting to check out.
And is 3D.GameHeroes worth a buy?
Yes, if you like the Zelda games, yes.
Although this game is a lot harder than the Zelda games.
If you're a video game nerd, which you probably are if you're listening to this show, there's lots of video game nerd references all over the game.
And it's very Zelda-like.
And you can probably find that stuff on sale.
I mean, it was only $30 originally when it came out, right?
So now you can probably find it for like $15 or $20 and it's absolutely worth it at that price.
The only drawback, it's not a very long game once you know what you're doing.
You'll probably beat it in like six hours.
So...
Something to consider.
I would say if you can find it on sale, absolutely.
Don't pass it up.
Moving on to some other tweets.
Some people are venting that they weren't able to listen to OLR.
Sorry.
DJ Ranma S says, I had a problem with three of the titles.
I'm not even going to look at this and I'm going to tell you they're probably trying to just create controversy to get page hits.
Period.
They want people to dig this and what have you and just get more page hits.
It's probably not really accurate but I'm going to look now and see what they came up with.
So again, this is a link from
DJ Ranma S on Twitter, it's IGN's top 10 worst games of 2010, and he says he has a problem with three of these titles, number 10, Sonic the 4, Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the 4, Sonic the Hedgehog 4, episode 1, I can see where that's landing on people's lists, it was a bit of a disappointment for a lot of people, number 9, the PlayStation Move, see, that's not even really a game,
8.
Lost Planet 2 7.
Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Days 6.
Crackdown 2 Would you say that was one of the 10 worst games of the year, Loki?
It's not the worst game, but it was definitely a disappointment compared to the last one.
But it's not... I wouldn't say that's the worst game.
That's not even a bad game, really.
Number five, Microsoft Connect.
Oh, fuck off.
It's too early to tell if Connect is... They gave it a good review, even.
No, that's just... It's for page hits.
This is why you do not read corporate media websites.
I mean, this is a... Anyhow.
Four, Fable 3.
I've been hearing raves about Fable 3.
They gave it good reviews also.
Number three, Medal of Honor.
2.
Gran Turismo 5 1.
Final Fantasy XIII Fuck off!
How can you put XIII on the list and not XIV?
Your opinion is invalid, person that wrote this article.
Is that even an article or is that a blog post?
I stopped caring.
It's a piece of poop.
It's just a joke.
Who gives a crap?
I don't know, it says slash articles.
It doesn't say blog.
No, it says editor.
There's some dude that has an editor badge or whatever.
Great.
That's awesome.
Fail.
Yeah, I'm reading some comments in our chat room.
IGN equals fail.
IGN equals we need more hits.
I bet FFXII is worse than Final Fantasy XIII.
That's what you get for reading IGN.
There you go.
Enough said.
All right.
Tigerclaw sends us some links.
He sent us a few.
I don't know which ones to read.
Oh, I like this one, and this didn't make our show tonight, and I remember reading this.
Tigerclaw sends us this link.
Actor Billy Bob Thornton...
Speaking of people that need to fuck off, blames video games for the death of quality in Hollywood.
Here's some lovely quotes from Billy Bob Thornton, because when I want an expert on video games, I think, I wonder what Billy Bob Thornton thinks.
I even actually have a sticker that says, WWBBTD
I just like the word lovely and Billy Bob Thornton going together Says the man who used to wear a vial of blood around his neck Why are game blogs even reporting what this asshole has to say?
Why is he fucking relevant?
Why are we not talking more about Jetpack Cat?
Why are we not more talking about her boobs?
They're right here in the studio and yet I'm talking about some dickhead Billy Bob Thornton story
Hey, it's where every gamer has a voice.
That's the stuff they tweeted us.
Next in all games radio, Marissa's tits.
What we need is Jetpack Cat to bounce off your boobies.
Meow, meow, meow, meow.
Oh, the boyfriend every morning comes up to me and he does the cat paw thing on the cleavage, you know, like when they're adjusting to get into bed.
Uh-huh.
Just bump, bump, bump, bump.
They're geared towards the video game playing generation.
And these video games, which I'm on my sum about constantly, these games are people killing for fun and I think traditionally in movies there's always been some kind of lesson in the violent movies.
By the way, his next picture is called Faster and it stars Dwayne The Rock Johnson as an ex-convict on a quest for revenge against the people who set him up in which the actor plays a flawed cop.
Oh, and by the way, he goes on a killing spree.
Not the cop, but you know.
Penalizing users of big breasts Penalizing users of big breasts
I think I'll also penalize players for making female characters with large breasts by applying common sense to that too oh this must be from like a role playing blog so like if you're gonna make a female character with big boobies just so that she can have big boobies this DM wants to have decreased maximum stamina stamina drains faster and you can't wear some sizes of torso armor have you ever found Marissa that there's certain torso armor you're unable to wear because I somehow doubt that
I have torso armor.
Actually, Rob.
What?
I played D&D once and if we were to we would actually have to roll for fitting sometimes for certain armors depending on different stats.
I'm serious.
He would actually say if you're going to be extra especially for the guys who would play female characters and would make them that busty.
Yes, I have been at many a D&D game where guys have played women.
Oh, right.
Yeah, they were too busty.
Yeah, they'd actually roll sizes for armor and then make them get a different class.
He was very nitpicky, but I've been at real tabletop games where they've done that.
Thanks for watching!
So I played the one lesbian.
I decided to play the very stereotypical man-hating lesbian because it was high school.
We're all stupid-ass kids.
So it was fun.
It was a lot of fun.
I always threatened to kick their ass.
It was good times.
I mean, I have boob armor in the Uta's brassier's Nazi bras.
So, I think I've told that story before.
I still love that.
I may do that for Dan.
Because Dan hadn't heard it.
By the way, the name is pronounced and he's in chat, so sorry about that.
Majinamikon.
Majinamikon.
Oh, like Necronomicon, but Maginomicon.
Yes.
Let's see.
We've got other stories from Tigerclaw.
I wanted to read at least one other one of these here.
How about the Kinect being hacked into a Super Mario Bros.
emulator controller?
Yes, somebody has hacked their Kinect.
There's this whole little video here of some dude on YouTube playing.
Oh, it's that same guy I saw in a video last week.
He hacked his Kinect, and he's actually running to the right and left and jumping to jump.
That's actually kind of cool.
When he jumps, Mario jumps.
And when he goes to the right side, the character moves right.
When he goes to the left side, the character moves left.
Okay, neat.
They're starting to get a little craftier with these Kinect add-ons.
So, you go, guy.
His name on YouTube, if you want to look at the video yourself, YankeeYan.
Y-A-N-K-E-Y-A-N.
Check that out.
You can see him kind of like doing the Mario Brothers dance.
It's a lot of fun there.
Mario.
One more tweet from DarkKisuke sends us, is AC Brotherhood amazing but pretty buggy?
I don't see a link with that, but has anyone played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood?
I've heard really good things about it.
A lot of my guildies in WoW are like, can't play WoW right now.
I'm playing Assassin's Creed.
Sorry.
So I sadly have not played the game myself.
But, gee, another console game being bugged on release.
What a surprise.
What a big surprise.
That's going to do it for Twitters this week.
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets for next week.
Meanwhile, back into some gaming news.
Loki.
Um, so yeah, there's some other interesting stuff.
This is kind of neat because the game came out so long ago, but apparently now Axl Rose is suing Activision over the inclusion of Slash in Guitar Hero 3.
Apparently, they're saying that, um...
They filed a $20 million lawsuit against the publisher for associating Guns N' Roses music, specifically Welcome to the Jungle, with the former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash and his new band Velvet Revolver in 2007's Guitar Hero 3 Legends Rock.
It says,
Broke its contract with Rose by including imagery of Slash in the game and offering music by Velvet Revolver as downloadable content.
It says the juxtaposition exploits the prior association between Slash and Guns N' Roses and promotes Slash and Velvet Revolver.
Separate interest includes...
VR tracks as available downloads, all of which was and is indirectly contrary to the contractual obligations of the defendants.
That's a query in the filing.
And...
Let's see.
How were sales of Chinese Democracy?
Just out of curiosity.
That album that took, what, like 10 years to make?
I have no idea.
Is he being a bitter Betty?
Because I think Axl Rose is being a bitter Betty.
It says...
Apparently, there's a comment, Activision's EVP of Music Affairs, Tim Riley, is quoted as saying, Come on, Beta, you can't believe everything you read on the internet.
In response to rumors of Slash's inclusion, heard by Rose's rep, Beta Labase, I guess, whether Rose's claims of treachery on Activision's part turn out to be true or not, that remains to be determined.
Oh, we actually have another comment that's coming in right now over email from Activision.
Official comment on this whole piece.
Quote, fuck you, Rose.
What do you know?
There it is.
It's more of Axl Rose being an ass.
It's Axl Rose being Axl Rose, actually.
Well, it sounds like here that, well, I don't know.
They said that
It's just weird, like, a lot of these losses, I guess, take a really long time, maybe?
I mean, because they're on, what, Guitar Hero... It'd be the equivalent of Guitar Hero, like, 6?
Yeah, this is about Guitar Hero 3.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, if Slash actually has songwriting credit on that song, I don't know how legitimate that claim could really be, because, you know, he's allowed to be represented as a musician, unless they make him not exist.
Here's the thing, is it's not really saying, you know... It's just...
Just because Slash is in the game, I understand that people would associate Slash maybe with Guns N' Roses, but he's kind of moved on now.
Just because there's a Guns N' Roses song in there and Slash is in there doesn't necessarily mean that
I don't know.
You can hire a lawyer to say anything.
I think of Slash as independent at this point.
I don't necessarily associate Slash strictly with Guns N' Roses.
I associate Slash with that kind of like fro-y, hairy thing he has.
It's not even really like a fro though.
He just has beautiful hair you just want to run your fingers through even though you know it's a wig.
What exactly is wrong with associating all that stuff anyways?
What kind of damages were actually caused to Guns N' Roses?
I think Guitar Hero 3
You know, arguably was probably a pretty good game, I mean, at the time.
And...
I don't think it's really negative for them.
I mean, didn't they have Chinese democracy as download content?
I love this.
As J100Matt says, well, you know what they say, every rose has its thorn up its ass.
Giovedea, I love this.
Also, it's a guitar game.
Who is the guitar player in the band?
I mean, that's just what Activision should take to court right there.
Giovedea should be a lawyer.
There you go.
Ah, whatever.
Whatever, dude.
I also love the comment here from Deathwishing.
It was a while ago, but at chat.orange.com Axel Rose needs money for cocaine and blow.
Yeah, that's what it's come to.
Well, let's move on to something happy, bouncy, fun, and talk about Virtual Console.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Lufia and the Fortress of Doom and Lufia 2 Rise of the Sinistrals those were all very recent trademarks that were applied for that means that these games could be coming out on virtual console very soon usually that is what this ends this kind of ends up meaning
Just so you know, Daria's twin was actually released on the Japan version earlier this year.
Lufia, I don't think, has been released just yet, but it looks like it might be.
Well, hooray for Virtual Console actually getting some new content.
That's got to be exciting for them, right?
Good games, too.
Uh-huh.
There you go.
No, not Daria's twin.
No.
Marissa, that's not Daria's twin.
Just so you know.
All right.
DarkSakura, what do you have?
Thanks for watching!
um anyway Julius is uh has the extra long whip that can work as a grappling hook and Yoko has uh magic which definitely goes back to the old games so that's pretty cool um so let's just hope that it improves the game some all right
No!
No!
Actually, you're wrong.
The answer is yes.
Apparently there is an extremely realistic racing simulator called iRacing.
No, it's not for the iPod or iPad.
Apparently the top driver won $10,000 despite never driving over 100 miles an hour in real life.
TopGear put him into an actual race car to see if the digital skills translate into real racing prowess.
Apparently, he did pretty well.
He clocked in a lap time 3 seconds off of what an experienced driver would be expected to deliver.
Of course, they say three seconds is an eternity in motorsports, but, you know, considering this is his very first time, it's pretty awesome.
His braking points were spot on, and he seemed firm and precise on the throttle.
And in the fastest corner, he's entering 100 miles an hour compared to an experienced driver's 110 miles an hour, a sign of absolute confidence and natural feel for grip, as Top Gear wrote.
and so apparently, I guess, you know, training on a really, I mean, it kind of makes sense.
If you're training on a game that's an extreme simulation of the real thing, it's almost like doing the real thing since it's a simulation of that.
But can you change a tire?
Okay.
That's not the driver's job, okay?
That's what your pit crew is for.
Right, it just takes down sexiness points, that's all I'm saying.
Okay.
My only worry is that, you see, I look at this and go, well hold on though, just because I play Microsoft Flight Simulator or whatever they're calling it now, Microsoft Flight, doesn't mean I can fly a plane.
But we should see if you can.
No, we shouldn't.
No, they have simulators for that.
I just...
But see, my thought is that it's supposed to work the other way around.
If I know how to fly a plane, then Microsoft Flight Simulator is supposed to be a way for me to kind of like, I don't know, I guess practice without practicing or sort of like relive that experience from the comfort of my own home.
But Rob, you're saying that if I'm good at an arcade game, I can't go fight off an alien race?
You know, I believe that is what I'm saying, yes, actually.
That's not...
I don't wanna live in that world.
I think you do, I'm sorry.
You can sense the gravity movement within the car itself, and when it needs something... I mean, I know this isn't a regular driving simulation, but still, drivers get an intuition about their own car, with all the moving parts and everything.
Of course, with the simulators that I play, I'd need an Uzi, and I'd be firing at the back of their car, and destroying their tires.
Does the simulator simulate the G-forces and all that stuff, too, though?
No, see...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No, it's not that at all.
It's just saying that, you know, you're just not, you haven't experienced those G-forces and stuff and the physical toll of driving that fast, you know, you have to compensate for that.
And if you can't do that with a simulator, then you're not really ready for the real thing.
For the record though, I mean, most 16-year-olds drive like they learned on Grand Theft Auto anyway, so.
True.
There's some real dipshit drivers out there on the road.
Watch out for my sisters.
How did you get a license?
Jesus.
All right.
Anyhow, how about a story about Tron?
Yes, Tron.
We heart Tron.
Which, by the way, the Tron soundtrack is out around the internets.
Got it.
Thanks for watching!
So the PC, the PS3, and the 360 versions of the game, they will actually include codes that will allow you to unlock some additional multiplayer maps and a character skin that is basically Sam Flynn.
So I guess think of that as your whole encouragement to not buy the game used, some additional maps and the code and all that.
Yes, but that's some of the downloadable Day 1 DLC.
So at least they're not charging you to play the game online if it's a used copy, but yeah, only with the new copy are you going to get some of this extra stuff.
And that's usually the way publishers do it.
They don't pull this dick-ass move like EA or, you know, THQ.
EA at least will, you know, give you a trial, and it's only really with their sports games, so if, you know, you want to play online, I mean, most of the sports games you're probably buying new anyways, but like THQ with their martial arts games and stuff,
It's just a dick move.
I'm sorry.
Sorry, no trial whatsoever.
You have to pay money up front if you don't buy this game.
I'm new.
Alright, well we're going to open up the mailbag at mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com and dive into the email bag and DarkSakura is going to go in and pull out some emails and read them for us.
Just two.
Just two?
One says, non-credible rumor.
Okay.
Just a silly rumor I may or may not have heard.
Chayark may be doing a side project to bring casual gamers to Star Trek Online, allowing players to establish a Klingon salon.
The first salon to be set up, Modern Warfare.
I'm gonna guess this is just a joke, DarkSakura.
Yes, it is.
That's what I said.
And a congratulations to our winner of our Castlevania Symphony of the Night code.
It goes to Mike.
And enjoy it.
You are quite welcome.
He says, oh my gosh, thank you so much.
I love you guys.
Heart.
Smile.
There's probably like a hundred guys named Mike that listen to this show.
Well, this Mike who won.
Okay.
Mike who won.
Mike who won.
That's now your last name.
Mike who won.
The winner is you.
That's it?
That's it.
We've had some kind of like not very full mail times lately.
Turkey coma.
I guess.
Turkey coma.
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.
You really need to fill her up for next week.
Like I want part B to be nothing but DarkSakura reading emails.
That'd be fun.
Do it and die.
All right.
Well, let's do the FUs of the week then.
Um, F you to, uh, money and my lack thereof.
I want my severance check, do you hear me, you bastards?
But... They might if you bang a little louder.
But I am glad to be free of that horrid, horrid place.
Okay.
I have to say, Nephew, too, the fact that this week is actually a regular week and not a short week like last week was.
I don't know.
I get spoiled by the short weeks.
It's awesome.
But, yeah, Nephew the Roundtable for forgetting to put my order in when I ordered it.
That's why I call ahead, you know, because if I wanted it not ready, I would just go in and order it.
But, you know, that's technicality, I guess.
I don't really have a lot to be angsty about right now.
Things are pretty good all things considered.
I'll just say F you to the fact that I had a nice long weekend and it's over.
Oh, F you to the fact that I stayed up until 4 in the morning last night.
That really wasn't smart.
Because I have to get up at 4 in the morning on Thursday to catch a flight to Burbank.
So that really wasn't smart of me.
Just saying.
Marissa, do you have any FUs you want to throw out there?
Maybe you have some angst?
It's my shock, anyone who knows me, but I'm not mad at anything right now.
I guess FUs are not being able to stay out here long enough.
But I'm having a great time, so thank you.
Well, you're on vacation, so it's hard to give an FU.
If I'm in Hawaii and I'm full of FUs, if it's not about some bitch stewardess or bad hotel service, I'm really kind of a dick.
Oh, you know what?
I do have an FU.
I have an FU to the fact that I always have to fly on screaming baby airlines.
Thank you for flying.
I love how the stewardesses just don't care anymore.
Like, do you want peanuts?
You want to have some peanuts?
The thing that pisses me off is that I used to be neurotic about signing on 24 hours in advance so I could get the A1 boarding pass.
But now they got smart and they sell like 1 through 30 for an additional 10 bucks.
So I could be the first one on at like, you know, 24 hours before and I'll have like B1 to board.
And like that is soul crushing.
I used to have to do that for my boss, she was always flying southwest of here to my work for a law firm, and yeah, she was completely anal retentive about that, but the funniest thing now is that, I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but I said maybe like if you're a B and it's really obvious, and now they have the standing in the number order.
Don't give a shit.
They just take you.
You don't have to stand.
You can stand at 16 if you're number 50.
They don't care.
Right, yeah.
It's not exact.
But you definitely have those people that are like, Oh, excuse me.
I believe you need to be on this side of the sign because you're holding that number.
You just put your hand over that part where you're holding it.
I know.
So yeah, although I didn't have to get scanner molested, which was nice because I was not going to offer that picture.
Thanks for watching!
and like, it wasn't the part that they were taking the picture that bothered me, but they were just being such jerks.
Like, you need to put your hands up, sir!
It's like, give someone a badge and it just gives them the right to be a total asshole, you know?
It's like, God.
Learn customer, as someone who taught customer service for nine years, a lot of those security type people really bother me.
Yeah, they, actually, at least in my experience, they're really nice at Burbank, but, I mean, you talk about those image scanners, I mean, there's plenty of images that have already shown up on the internet, okay?
You take a scan of somebody that has gigantic boobs, or a big wing, or something unusual on your body, they don't get paid enough to be professional, I'm sorry.
They're totally gonna be like, hey guys, look at this, check this out, and, you know, like I said, I'll opt for the pat-down.
and, I mean, unlike anyone, you know, over 14 nowadays, I actually haven't, that picture of me from the site is, like, the dirtiest thing of me I'll find dry.
Right.
Um, but, um, but yeah, I'll offer the pat down, and my professor was saying in my law class that, um, that they even check your cleavage, and now I'm like, great, this'll take two days.
Shit.
I better get the hard hat on in the canary.
You know what?
My cleavage is like, you know that bag in Mary Poppins where she just pulls out stuff?
I can plug a lamp out of my cleavage.
She has an umbrella with a parrot head that talks to her in her boobs.
Yes, exactly.
So, airports are fun.
I don't mind having the nudie pictures taken.
It's faster.
Sit here and memorize it.
You should just strike a pose.
One of my friends when we were at the airport, when we went to Boston for PAX East, funny enough, she got picked for the random screening.
Because then it was not everybody did it.
It was just random.
I don't know if maybe it's still that way now.
So I didn't have to do it, but Amanda had to do it.
And she was excited.
She's like, I get to do the nudie picture.
Yay!
So she's like running over there and she like totally does this pose where she has her hands up and she's like, dude, this is because she's fucking adorable to begin with.
And then she does this whole like little like pose thing when she's standing there.
And I'm just like, you are having way too much fun with the nudie picture.
I like the people that have the idea of doing the the spinal tap thing and having a cucumber wrapped in a wrap and foil in your pants.
So, you can always spinal tap it.
Oh, boy.
Can you technically bring a cucumber wrapped in foil along?
Well, they'd find it in the scanner, but you cannot.
As they did in spinal tap.
Sorry, that was lunch.
I needed something to suck on on the plane.
Anyhow, let's move on.
Hey, more stories for you guys.
Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
As if this show couldn't go any further down the toilet, we're about to open it up to callers.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
But not just yet.
We still have a couple more stories for you guys.
Yeah, this is kind of neat.
Apparently EA Tiburon is rumored to be in early development for a new NFL Blitz because, hey, Midway sucked it up with that series and Warner didn't do too much better.
So now they're going to give it a new shot since, hey, NBA Jam did all right.
So, I don't know, NFL Blitz could be kind of fun.
I liked NFL Blitz.
I still haven't played any NBA Jam yet, though.
At least the new one.
But they say it probably won't arrive until 2012.
So, it's a rumor for now.
Alright, I like rumors, I guess.
NFL Blitz is kind of cool, so it'll be interesting if that's coming back as well as NBA Jam did earlier this year.
I'm sorry, I'm just distracted by a link that was posted in chat by SolarFlare.
Is it a fig leaf?
Yes, I guess you can buy panties or boxer briefs or whatever that have a giant fig leaf on them that are made of some type of radiation-proof material, so when they scan you, the little fig leaf will come up.
It must be for bras, too.
Oh, you can get the hands for the bras.
Yes.
Like the Barbra Streisand dress Or I don't know if you've seen Burlesque yet but there's definitely a nod to that Has it been a hot mess of glitz and glam?
I did see Burlesque this week, the day after Thanksgiving.
Actually, no, I saw it on Thanksgiving, and it was very, very, very gay.
It was Cher the best.
People were complaining that it wasn't hot mess enough.
That's what I heard.
Look, if you're going to go see Burlesque, and you're going to go see a movie starring Cher and Christina Aguilera, you ought to know exactly what you're going to get.
And the movie does deliver.
You get exactly that.
but I'm just saying it's it's it's a movie starring Cher I mean there's you know if this is for you or not like there's no surprise here I would not recommend Loki go see this unless maybe he wants to check out there are some scantily clad women but they don't ever deliver on the actual I know I was saying where's the real burlesque with the pasties
Yeah, no, they don't do any of that.
It is kind of like, it's watered down burlesque a little bit.
But then there's that part of me, it's like, but Cher is a fucking fierce, fierce bitch, and she steals every scene she's in.
Every scene Cher is in.
Is it like an extended Lady Marmalade video?
Yeah, that's fair, that's fair.
But with Cher, and she's made of awesome, so...
And I know a lot of the listeners probably don't want to hear this, but we'll have girl talk here for a minute.
I will say the guy that plays Christina Aguilera's love interest in the movie is smoking hot.
Smoking hot.
He kind of reminded me of the previews of a young Cary Elwes, but he's aged weird, so.
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
He was so cute back in the day.
I saw Cary Elwes in a preview for Saw 3D, and I was like, oh, wow.
Wow.
He's back in that?
Yeah.
I don't really like to follow the Saw movies from what I understand.
They bring him back as part of a... Flashback film?
No, people who've all survived the games from prior.
But he didn't survive.
I don't know.
Whatever.
Chat wants to know, was it better or worse than Showgirls?
On a scale of 1 to Showgirls?
It's not really any surprises.
But if you're just going to have fun and just not really think for a couple hours, it's good for that.
I just heard people complaining that they want it to be showgirls era hot mess.
No, it's not that much of a hot mess.
To keep it on the gamer topic, what about Burlesque the game?
Well, I'd like to see that on Xbox Connect, actually.
Actually, I'd have to shake your titties.
No, I'm kidding.
You know that somebody's going to come up with something like a concerted connect thing specifically for that.
Oh, hey, back to video games.
I do have one more.
Hey, actually, funny enough, this is about the boobs and Kinect.
So maybe they could use this in a burlesque-type game.
But the Xbox 360's Kinect, it can track the head, it can track the hands, but now it can track the breasts.
That's right, this is Dan Wilcox actually hacked the Kinect to see if it could spot his chest.
And what happens is that the computer is looking for his man boobs and draws a bra or pasties on top.
Ha ha ha ha!
and music plays when titties are detected.
So sure enough, there's this little video called the Connect Titty Tracker and the guy's moving back and forth and like it draws a little bra on his chest.
I look for a person-sized blob and use its centroid to approximate a search box wherein to detect two boobs.
So I don't know if it would work on women yet, but we haven't seen that video, or at least it's not appropriate to be on family websites.
I don't know.
But there you go.
The Connect can now officially track your movies.
You are just giggling way too much, Rob.
Like a little girl.
There's so much stupid shit on tonight's show.
Like, really?
I love it.
Alright, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.
Let's just take it from bad to worse.
Let's open up the Skype line.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
Or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Give us a call.
We'll talk.
Hi, this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator, did you call in to talk about boobs?
Well, that wasn't even my intention, but sure, why not?
They're always relevant.
What did you call in to talk about tonight?
Well, as I had mentioned on Twitter, and you had turned red earlier in the show, I was going to call out about...
That new Voodoo service over on PlayStation Network Oh yes, tell us a little bit about Voodoo Because I'm not very familiar with it What's up with Voodoo?
Well, as far as I know, it's a relatively new service I think it was started by either Walmart or Best Buy Or one of those big retail chains Basically, they're equivalent to the PlayStation Network video store
basically you can rent or buy movies from their service kind of like what you can do from PlayStation Network and plus it has full Twitter and Facebook integration on that and not only that but you know here's kind of a
Unusual interface to it, or at least unusual compared to, say, the Xbox video marketplace and compared to PlayStation Network.
Now, it has a multi-page menu to it where
It'll give you a whole bunch of information regarding the movie like a plot summary Oops, sorry, I'm on the website and it started a video I hate this fucking autoplay shit Sorry, I was on the Voodoo website trying to educate myself but it started an autoplay video Well, basically it has a multi-page menu to it where it'll tell you all about the movie who made it, who's in it, plot summary so on and so forth, even the
The box art to the movie, like what you would see on DVD or Blu-ray, whatever.
Now, there is an interface thing on it.
I love the interface.
It's a whole lot better than PlayStation Network and Microsoft's service.
And plus, you know,
with their videos, you know, you can even get 5.1 surround sound on the videos.
So, okay, so it has a very pretty interface.
Does it cost money to use it?
Yeah, it's basically, you know, you pay actual dollars and cents to rent or buy the movie just like you would for Blockbuster video or Hollywood video or anywhere else.
You know,
Unlike where, you know, unlike Netflix where you got like, you know, one flat fee, rent everything.
Now you pay per movie on Vudu.
All right.
Well, you know what I find interesting?
Vudu, I'm reading about it.
They were just recently bought by Walmart.
So it's the Walmart movie company now, although they're still called Vudu.
It's actually owned by Walmart.
So I hope they don't go in and edit movies like they do CDs that get sold in the stores.
That would be disappointing.
and the thing is with the Voodoo app over on PlayStation Network they actually give you the first rental free everything else after that you know you have to pay for so does that mean everybody can go get one free movie just by like signing up yep the only thing you gotta do is put in like an email address well yeah but everybody has an email address they send all their spam to so that'll work
Yeah.
Now, there's a couple minor downsides to it.
Well, even... No, I should... Wait, wait, wait.
I gotta say something.
Hold on.
This is very interesting.
I'm sorry.
Voodoo apparently at one point actually would rent adult titles.
But on February 25th, to comply with the policies of its parent company, Voodoo discontinued operating the AVN After Dark channel, which had the adult movies on it.
Aww.
Now see, it's a bummer they didn't keep that open, because I've been saying this for the longest time, whoever brings us the porno first is going to win this video on demand war.
So if Voodoo had done it, man, nobody would even be talking about Hulu, because Voodoo has the titties.
Yeah, despite all the things I do like about the Voodoo service, there's a couple things I don't like about it, which are kind of major issues.
First of all, you can't download any videos that you rent or buy locally to your hard drive.
You have to stream it.
And combine that with the fact that you have to be logged into PlayStation Network while you're viewing the movies.
So if, God forbid, for whatever reason, your internet goes out or whatever, basically you're SOL.
And not only that, but I have
as a side note, a really fast internet connection roughly about 20 megabits per second and even with that and having every other device turned off like my 360 and PSP and so forth when I rented the really high quality HDD expendables with 5.1 surround sound the movie was constantly stuttering, trying to buffer
and what not and that shouldn't happen because I have a fast internet service and not only that but it seems like every minute and a half to two minutes it literally would stop streaming out the gallery saying oh yeah we can't there's some kind of network problem
If you're willing to deal with a few headaches, go ahead and try it.
There's a free rental.
But
No, I wouldn't actually pay money out of pocket for it, though.
Alright, there you have it.
Spazinator, thanks for the review on Voodoo.
We're going to let you go so we can get more calls.
Alright, have a good one.
Alright, have a good one.
Later.
Alright, it's a bummer he missed out on all the pornography, but I guess that was the pre-PlayStation 3 era or something, IDK.
1877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
By the way, some kind of late-breaking news here, I guess I can go ahead and say this, it's not really a secret, Loki was successfully able to get a hold of the Techno Kitten Adventure guys, so we're going to
We're going to see when he's available.
He says he's available Sundays.
As soon as next week, we'll try to get him.
That's astounding.
I'm so excited.
Alright, more calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Deathwishing.
Deathwishing.
What is on your mind, my friend?
Well, first of all, I want to say that this episode has made me laugh very hard for returning back after, like, I don't know how many months I lost track.
I know, I was going to say, we haven't heard from you in a little while, so I'm glad we are still once in a while funny.
That's good to know.
Well, I want to say you need to get on PlayStation Home.
A lot has changed.
Okay, tell me why I need to get on PlayStation Home.
I got an email from them the other day, like, come visit us and see what's changed.
And I just kind of wrote it off as... They did a 3D.
I think they have 3D support on some stuff.
I don't know if something's loaded.
I'm not sure if it's just a little icon thing.
3D, like it's a 3D item.
Okay, well, I don't have a 3D device.
There's a DDR room.
There's that DDR room I've been talking about on the chat room all night long.
Okay, what's the DDR room?
Do I actually get to play actual DDR or do I get to watch my avatar stomp on a fake machine?
You go...
You go into the Konami penthouse.
Yes, a penthouse because I guess Konami thinks you're like players or something.
And you go out there and there's a Konami points and it's integrated with Facebook too.
Your Konami points will be on Facebook if you download the Facebook leaderboards app.
I can spam on my friends via home?
Yay!
Just like a Facebook game.
But now you go out there and there's a dance floor of all these people with their really messed up avatars.
Guys dressed up as the PlayStation Move dildo thing, whatever.
And you can go out there and every now and then there's a group dance-off and then a dance-off item.
And it's actual DDR.
You play, it's like, you know, you press the buttons up, down, left, right on your D-pad.
I don't know if they have support for the pad, someone could confirm that for me.
When they have it and you do it, they earn points.
It's pretty cool, but I have yet to win a match because I'm white.
Well, just because you recommended it, sir, I will make it a point to check it out this week and see what's going on.
A lot different.
There's a lot of different stuff to it.
Well, what else besides just the Konami space?
So we get it.
There's DDR in there now.
What else is available?
There's a park.
What am I trying to say?
You missed out on some Thanksgiving event with chasing turkeys.
Could people dress up as turkeys?
Because I remember one of their big events was the furry event.
You chase the turkeys around and you could get a turkey costume.
I swear, Home doesn't even try to hide that it's catering to the furries.
It really doesn't try to hide it at all.
Well, you know they actually have costumes now that you could dress up as a cat or a bulldog or stuff like that.
I think the people that need to know that already know it.
Can I do anything with the OLR club now?
I'm not sure.
I kind of canceled my join request because I...
I know, we got full!
We can only hold 25 people, and by some miracle of God, there's more than that that want to join.
Ooh, if that's true, then I'll go add more people.
Hold on, I gotta send a video of DDR and PlayStation Home.
This looks fucking stupid.
It's just all these people moving around on a dance club.
Let me see if this gets interesting at all.
Oh, hold on, I turned the audio off.
And it has the whole, like, chibi music.
Oh, a group dance-off is starting.
That looks like any douchebaggy club on Sunset.
Well, you'll have to pay $10 to get in there and get stared at by a bouncer, so... Wow, it is kind of DDR at home, I'll give it that.
That's... okay.
It's just kind of interesting.
It's a little minigame, you know?
Something to do on home, because there's really not much to do on home.
Why does the guy have, like, landing flares?
I want to get in the costume and go dancing home like this.
Why am I not seeing, like, a single pedo bear on the dance floor?
That's what I want to know.
I saw some dude dressed up as, like, Mr. Muscle Man up there with his pedo on.
I was just like I was at a rave.
Pants on the ground.
Pants on the ground.
They're DDRing too.
Pants on the ground.
So yeah, anything else in home besides pants on the ground and turning into a turkey?
Actually, if your pants could go on the ground, home would probably be a lot more popular with a certain crowd.
Midway, which is like that one place on the pier, whatever that place is.
You can play carnival games there and earn prizes.
It's still a standard home affair.
and I don't see how it's still open beta.
It's been open beta forever.
It's just like Gmail's been in beta.
Actually, I think Gmail finally came out of beta like five years later.
I think it's just like they put it there open beta just to say it's going to grow.
It's just a constant reminder that they don't owe you shit.
That's really... The beta tag being on there so long is really just a reminder like we don't owe this to you.
There's actually some clothing that costs $15.
Like, no joke.
$15?
It's a golden suit.
What is it?
It's a golden suit and it rains money.
The Birthday Suit
Hold on, I'm googling this right now.
$15 home suit.
My character, which I haven't logged on to home in forever, still looks like a hobo Santa Claus.
I was going to say, didn't you buy the Santa Claus outfit?
That is the only outfit I will be wearing.
You are a dumbass.
I don't know why you spent actual money on that.
I have a character I made, but I have like two characters I made.
One looks like I somehow got punched in the jaw by Mike Tyson, so it looks like it's chint and that's unbelievable strength.
I'm actually looking here on the... We can hear you typing over there, hun.
It should be a golden suit.
Yeah, I'm looking.
I got linked to a GameFAQs thread where they're saying that the gold suit is located inside the store made out of gold.
Who would have thought?
No one told me it dispenses money when you wear it.
I has a want.
It's in a store called Exclusives.
You go in there and have exclusive items.
And I want the really exclusive item because it rains money.
You have to have $15 to buy it.
We can walk around the home and be like, hey guys, check out my pixels.
It actually rains down your money so your bank account gets drained even faster.
I don't understand.
Alright, but if that's what you're into, then hooray.
Alright, I will check out home this week, I promise, but we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls.
We wanna get at least one more call in, okay?
Shout out to Mass San Francisco.
What's that?
Is that a rave?
It's your bike club.
Okay, should I go?
I go to San Francisco all the time.
No, you have to be kind of a hipster.
I don't think you're a hipster.
Oh, I don't have a Tumblr.
All right.
Have a good one.
All right.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Use the name on Skype.
It's Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
We'll go to the phones, take another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hola.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hi?
It sounds like the microphone got lost under a pile of dirty laundry.
Hello?
Hi!
Hello?
Hello?
Hi, who's this?
Nathan.
Hey, Nathan!
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Nathan.
Yes, Nathan, yes, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
That was like Space Age sounding.
Yeah, do you have a question, Nathan?
Yes, is this an Xbox?
Run that by me again?
Did he ask, is this an Xbox?
No, this is not an Xbox, sir.
It's an internet radio program.
I can't handle it.
I can't hear.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
I can't.
Echo 123 before you give us a call on Skype.
Make sure your connection works.
Echo 123.
Did I hear that wrong?
I thought I heard... I think his mic started cutting off.
I think it was like, you know, something about on Xbox, something, something.
All right.
Well... Or is like Xbox, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah.
Try again next week.
All right.
1877GAMEOLR, username on Skype.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Do you have any last-minute stories, Loki, before we get to another call?
Oh, we have another call coming in right now, so forget it.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
True, yeah, hello there, you American things over there.
It's that one, Swede Akeripper.
Fuck yes, I was hoping that a Swede would call us tonight.
What's on your mind?
Well, I could finally talk about Sims 3 that I've been playing since it came out.
Sims 3 that you've been playing since it came out.
What's up about Sims 3?
No, no, no.
Modification.
The expansion.
The expansion.
Late Night.
Ah, Sims 3 Late Night.
What happened to DarkSakura in Sims 3?
That's what I want to know.
I haven't heard DarkSakura talk about Sims 3 in a long time.
Like, she used to be like... Because I have to reinstall all of my stuff so I can use my mods again.
You have to get on that, miss.
I know.
Rob, I'm in school.
I'm busy.
All right, well, Aki River's going to tell us all about the expansion then.
Yeah, well, the expansion is, as usual, really nice.
But the whole thing is that, well, the celebrity thing is a bit stupid, as one can be expected.
But the vampire thing is kind of like meh, almost, in some way.
But what are the... Well, the kind of like good thing is that, well, we finally have...
Penthouse and such and apartments which is kind of good in one way if you're having a small Sims family.
So you can get a penthouse, huh?
Alright, I'm liking where this is going.
Do you get to get a $15 gold suit?
No, you can't.
Not yet.
Alright.
Do they do anything else besides just like items?
Are there new like game modes or new things in your Sims experience?
Oh, um...
What are their new skills?
Oh yeah, the new music stuff is kind of cool once you get the hang of it.
And one of the annoying parts about vampires that really frustrates me like hell is that if you have vampire children, they can skill up
Hold on, hold on.
Hold on, back up, rewind, press pause.
You can be a vampire now in The Sims?
Yeah.
Can you sparkle?
Yeah, so you can, well, be all that series.
Do you get to sparkle?
Is this like Twilight vampires?
No, no, it's not exactly like that.
Oh, thank God.
They don't sparkle.
Oh, thank God.
So they're not Mormon vampires.
Yeah.
Okay.
There are vampires, but there aren't any werewolves, so it's not...
So it's not 100% Twilight Well that's a relief, thank god So you can do more like, I don't know, Dark Shadows As opposed to Because like Dark Shadows, cool vampires Twilight, not cool vampires Big difference Barnabas, awesome R. Pattinson, not awesome
Oh yeah, but one of the kind of like cool is that you can actually build your own swimming pool within a few stories up of sorts.
Before you couldn't actually build a pool.
Yes, I could drown people on a roof.
Wait, can you torture the vampires by, like, putting them in sunlight or, like, you know, putting a bunch of garlic in the kitchen?
That's really, like, fun because vampires here can't...
Be in the twilight, be in the sun that often, but if you do, you will get this, oh, can't stand too much sun, and they, like, um, oh, how do you say it, though?
They, um, they, uh, oh, they lose their heads, of course.
So, it's quite hilarious.
I haven't killed anyone yet doing that.
Torturing Sims is the whole reason to play Sims.
You need to get on that.
yeah alright well Aki Ripper let's try to wrap up here is the Sims 3 night time expansion a must have yeah it is and oh and let's not forget there is actually some nice very very very very nice clothing for your Sims do we mean lack of clothing or like actual clothing actual clothing in this one
Thanks for watching!
Won't see any pixels, but you won't see anything anyway, so.
They're just Sims, people.
All right.
All right, Aki Ripper, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for calling in to talk about the Sims, and please torture some Twilight vampires for us.
Yeah, I will.
All right.
Later, buddy.
Was he swearing in Swedish at the end?
He probably was.
Alright.
He was casting a voodoo hex on us in Swedish.
He'd be saying, die American scum.
Exactly.
And I'm just like, ooh, I love ABBA, yay!
Alright.
Anyhow, that's going to do it for the calls tonight.
Sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through, but we've got to wrap things up.
It's almost midnight on the East Coast, so at 9 o'clock here, and I've got to have tacos.
So we're going to wrap things up, but quickly, Loki has not really had an opportunity to do the rest of the last-minute story, so I want to see if... Yeah, I don't really care either.
Would you have anything you want to get out there?
No.
Well, fine.
See if I care.
That's it then.
We're done.
We're out of here.
I was seeing if there was any last things.
I can do one thing.
Oh, changed our minds.
Yeah, one thing.
The game Ilo Milo, I guess it's not out yet, at least on Xbox Live Arcade, but there is a way you can get to play it and actually be... It's a way of promoting the game virally, I guess.
and it is out for free on Windows Phone 7 devices but on Xbox Live Arcade there is a way to download the demo which if you want to you can download the full game before it's released.
And to do that you go to the website which is...
WP7SuperSecretAccess.ilomilo.com
You should copy-paste that link in chat so our chatters can just click it and go get their game if they want.
Sounds like fun.
Of course, that's just the demo, though.
It's a demo, but you can buy the game through that so you can be playing the full game technically before it's released.
Alright.
Very nice.
Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up the show for tonight.
Marissa, I want to thank you for being here.
I know you're not huge on the video games, but I still love having you on the show.
You laugh and validate our jokes, and I really appreciate that.
Because sometimes I think the jokes I say are so stupid.
I tune in every week, man.
I always have a good time.
Thank you.
That's a high compliment.
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight, or any last things you want to plug before you leave?
Yeah.
I don't know.
No, just thank you to everyone for entertaining me and apparently being entertained by my bosom.
This was a great time, thanks.
Please come back.
Thank you.
DarkSakura, who's got her headphones on over there.
She's jamming to something other than OLR.
I'm trying to figure out what my cage match song is.
Oh, you're worried about the post-OLR stuff.
You should talk to this one over here.
She has some ideas.
All right, anyway.
Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
Uh, words.
Happy birthday, Dan!
Uh, my final thought tonight is, um, I hope I, uh, get to bed before 4 a.m.
tonight.
That would be good.
Does that have to work tomorrow?
Uh, Loki, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
Um, I...
I want to put Christmas lights up in my tree, but my tree is very tall and my ladder is very short.
So that'll be interesting.
Good luck with that.
It was fun.
I had the MacGyver them up using a broomstick handle and a paint can opener.
Awesome.
All right, that's it.
We're going to wrap up for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show, be it live here at All Games Radio or through the podcast feed.
We really appreciate it and your guys' support.
Next week on the show, more LOL game news and whatever comes up during the week.
Plus, we're going to try and track down the Techno Kitten Adventure guy.
Loki is an excellent stalker, apparently, and found the guy, so we're going to try to get him on within the next couple weeks and ask about the greatness that is that game and where we can get the soundtrack, absolutely.
So we'll have all that coming up in the next few weeks.
In the meantime, the show is free.
All we ask, tell a person or two about the show.
Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because we do not have a big website backing us up.
We don't write bullshit top ten lists to get hits or anything like that.
We just rely on you guys and your friends to help us spread the word so we can slowly take over the world.
Sound good?
Alright, we'll be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Until then, have a wonderful week.
