1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,760
The creators of Rock Band are up for sale.

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,520
A popular DS title finally gets localized for Japan and did the indie games movement

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,600
Backlash caused change at Microsoft.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,920
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Radio.

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,400
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,520
Walking you through gaming chat over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and with

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,040
me as always, my awesome co-host, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm upset with you, Rob.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
Why now?

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Because of this game.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
What game?

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,320
Ooh, you're playing Knights of the Old Sorority as we talked about last week.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Yes.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,120
Knights of the Vampire Mafia War thing.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Excellent.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
I blame you.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,120
Well, it is my fault.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,400
We'll talk about stupid clicky games in a minute.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,840
But we have to say hello, of course, to the one and only tech master, eBay-loving, Loki.

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Hey.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,360
How you doing, Loki?

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
I'm doing fine.

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
All right.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
What are you shopping for on eBay now?

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Oh, I'm not shopping for anything.

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
I was just looking at something.

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,720
I was just curious to see how much it went for.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,760
Do you do this at home too, shopping on eBay all the time, or does the wife get pissed?

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,440
I don't actually shop on eBay all the time.

31
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
All right.

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
All right.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,480
I was going to pick up something later on, but not for a while.

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,240
They have this XCM VBox 2.

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,760
It allows you to play Xbox games and stuff like that, or pretty much anything that has

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,960
a component in or a component out on your PC without lag.

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,080
So like, for example, the other day when I was shuffling to get it to work correctly-

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,920
I remember the DJ Hero 2 on a break.

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,820
I would have been able to play it just fine.

40
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,520
So I might pick that up, because it will be handy for different things.

41
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,960
But yeah.

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,000
That and my- rather be playing Grand Theft Auto license plate frame that I probably should

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,520
get for my car, because that'd be funny.

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,940
All right.

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,320
By the way, I went over to Loki's house to play some Kinect the other night, and that

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,040
was Good Times.

47
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Yep.

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,080
Shaking the butt in front of the camera that takes the pictures over and over again.

49
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,440
My room is really small to play.

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,000
So is my apartment, so it's all good.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,560
I'm thinking of mounting the TV to the wall, just for multiple reasons, because the cat

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,960
also likes to use a scratching post.

53
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,600
There you go, pretty soon you're going to have the baby running around, so it might

54
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
not be a bad idea.

55
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Nah, I'm not too worried.

56
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,120
Well, I mean, you get a bit of- you got at least nine months to go, but you know.

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm not worried about that.

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,600
I think, though, mounting it to the wall would give me an extra foot or two to be able to,

59
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,800
you know, so I won't have to be up against the couch to actually play, you know, Kinect

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
adventures.

61
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,880
It's dumb, that requirement.

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,280
By the way, finally, because it's just, I hardly ever get to Loki's house anymore, I

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,360
don't know why, but I finally got to meet the baby, and I got to see the nursery that

64
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,280
is all internet famous, like, you know, the pictures were on, what, Game Stops magazine

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,640
thingy, right?

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
They found him through Flickr or whatever.

67
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,840
I was going to take some video for you guys, but there was, you know, the baby was going

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,440
to bed, it wasn't a good time, but maybe one of these days I'll get the video.

69
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,200
I can take video too, I guess.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
I mean, I do have video cameras.

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,640
It's a nice setup, you should kind of show off a little more.

72
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,000
It's very gamer nerdy.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,420
Let's just hope the baby does not grow up to resent video games, that would be a tragedy.

74
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,200
By the way, speaking of nerdy stuff, I saw the best license plate in the world today.

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
You ready?

76
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Ready, nerds?

77
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,760
It was LoadStar81.

78
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,000
So I don't know, like, I don't know if the driver of that car, California plate, LoadStar81

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,760
listens to the show, but if you do, you made me laugh.

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,880
I was behind you today, and yeah, good times.

81
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,680
Also joining us tonight, say hello to, we have a special guest in the studio, he's been

82
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,520
joining us off and on over the past few months, and he's having an on night tonight.

83
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,400
Say hello to the one and only, Alan.

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Hello.

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Or Salacious Pop.

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Yes.

87
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
That's the case maybe.

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
How are you, Salacious Pop?

89
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm great.

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,560
I don't know why, but I feel like I should say that name all British style.

91
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Salacious Pop!

92
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Yeah.

93
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
All right.

94
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,840
So what, how's your week been, Salacious Pop?

95
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Good.

96
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Good?

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
Are you going to be giving me one word answers all night?

98
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,720
It's going to be a great radio show.

99
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Yes.

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
All right.

101
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,120
Maybe you'll have more to say when we get into gaming weeks, which I think we'll start

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
off with now.

103
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,960
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

104
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,240
Knights of the Vampire War, Crystals, Sorority Life, Farm Town.

105
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah, I played some of that crap.

106
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,960
And I played some, what is it, Chocobo's Tower, because it's really cute, and it plays the

107
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,000
Chocobo Farm music from Final Fantasy 7.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,400
Should I tell my story about Chocobo Farm Town or whatever that is now or later?

109
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
Go ahead.

110
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,920
So I started playing that game because they have a banner under the whole, like, Knights

111
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,040
of the old Crystal Sorority War game on Facebook.

112
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,800
I started playing the Chocobo Tower, and it's actually kind of cute.

113
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,240
There's some things about it, but I was, like, there's a lot to it, and a lot of it's just

114
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
kind of WTF.

115
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,040
And Alan walks in while I'm trying to play this earlier.

116
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
He's like, what are you doing?

117
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,160
I'm like, I'm trying to play this game, and I'm trying to breed my Chocobo with Jamie's

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Chocobo.

119
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,960
Like, I went to her farm to try and sex her Chocobo while she's not online to defend it.

120
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,720
And Alan's like, well, wait, your Chocobo's just a baby.

121
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
You can't do that.

122
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm like, I just fed it a growth cake.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then I'm like, what is this?

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,520
Is this what my life has become?

125
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,240
I'm talking about breeding Chocobos like it's real life?

126
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,560
Is this the future of video games?

127
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
It's a sad, sad world.

128
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,680
It's all defensive that you aged it with the magical cake.

129
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
You're like, I gave it the cake.

130
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,760
What are you talking about?

131
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Look at your life.

132
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Look at your choices.

133
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,400
Like, I hear you judging me, but I gave it cake.

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
It looks what I saw of it.

135
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,400
It just looked like a sort of more detailed web, sort of digipet Tamagotchi type thing.

136
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Because you have to brush it when it gets dirty.

137
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
So you click on the little bird.

138
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,980
It's like pet society, only they go battle each other.

139
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,680
It's ridiculous stupid, yet I'm playing it anyway.

140
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,120
They go off for hot chicken love.

141
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,320
And I totally sex Jamie's chicken when she wasn't looking.

142
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,840
And, and I snuck in her ranch last night and put feathers in the Chocobos hair.

143
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm going to go take them because then I'll get extra luck for them.

144
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Oh, nice.

145
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
You punked out my Chocobo.

146
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,040
You pimped my Chocobo.

147
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,360
It's called Pimp My Chocobo.

148
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
You know, this is not any better than playing, say, Farmville.

149
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,200
So I am going to look at you in shame.

150
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,560
No, because it's Square Enix.

151
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
No, I'm sorry.

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,300
And all the artwork in the Knights of the Crystal Republic, Vampire Wars, is by the

153
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,960
same guy who did Tactic's artwork.

154
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
So that's why it's all pretty.

155
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
And it's not Farmville.

156
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Oh, okay.

157
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
Well, I must be completely wrong then.

158
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Yes, you are.

159
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Except I'm not.

160
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,240
Because that's never happened in the course of this show.

161
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
I'm never wrong.

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,280
Are there any other video games you'd like to talk about?

163
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Yes.

164
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,040
I played a bunch of the Avatar game that got left at my house, what, three months ago?

165
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,480
So you're finally getting around to it?

166
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
I like it.

167
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,400
So being an Avi in Second Life didn't work out for you.

168
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
So now you get to...

169
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,040
I got tired of those people.

170
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,680
But I really liked the game, except that you're Ikran, the banshee thing.

171
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,480
I parked it so I could go get some stuff out of these flowers.

172
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,360
I came back and it was dead.

173
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
It got shot up.

174
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,620
It was laying dead in the water, and I'm like, now where am I going to get another one?

175
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,600
So I was like, well crap.

176
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,720
Did you have an emotional breakdown like the characters in the movie went there?

177
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Yeah.

178
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,880
Well, it's sort of one thing to be neurologically tied to a creature as it's dying, but that's...

179
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Apparently not too much.

180
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,920
It's like, eh, I'm going to go pick some flowers over here.

181
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Hm.

182
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,200
Since something's being shot, better not worry about that.

183
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Flower picking time.

184
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,680
No, I didn't even hear it getting shot.

185
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,120
Because there's like little tiny soldier men all over the place, because you're like ten

186
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,240
feet tall and they're like, little.

187
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,040
In fact, it was like when the character first hops around in her Avatar body and walks around,

188
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,360
she goes up to the human people and goes, you're so tiny!

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
It's cute!

190
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,400
Let me squish your tail in your head!

191
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,680
I picked a female character.

192
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,560
I need to introduce the ever-present fourth guest on our show, even though technically

193
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,920
Salacious Pulp is the fourth guest tonight.

194
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,080
We have our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night

195
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,220
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and you can join us in chat at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

196
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,260
Let's see, Jim Salley in our chatroom says, Japan's working on genetically creating chocobos

197
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
right now.

198
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Hm, could be.

199
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,760
They need to talk to the KFC people.

200
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,600
Frisbee says, Navi or Navi?

201
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Hello!

202
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Hey!

203
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Watch out!

204
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Listen!

205
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Hey!

206
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Dark Sakura!

207
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Listen!

208
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Hey!

209
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,320
Don't make me smite you.

210
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,680
Dan got Call of Booty Black Ops.

211
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,200
Now that's a game I play.

212
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
No, it's Call of Duty.

213
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,480
And speaking of Avatar, because it has a dude as the main guy's voice.

214
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Oh really?

215
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah.

216
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Did you hear though that you can play the full game of Zork in there?

217
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Yes you can.

218
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,680
I was listening to Bobby tonight on the car ride over, and yes, he was talking about it

219
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,280
on his show, and I was like, that's actually really cool.

220
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,400
Like Call of Duty, not my genre of game, not disrespect in the game, I realize a lot of

221
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,560
people play those games, I don't.

222
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
And the minigame.

223
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,600
But I think that's cool.

224
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,240
That plays a lot like Smash TV.

225
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,560
Oh, the zombie game or whatever, yeah yeah yeah.

226
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,480
Dan was like all over that, and then he was like, oh it's like Smash TV, and his friend

227
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,040
had never played Smash TV, so Dan's like we're turning this off, we're playing Smash TV.

228
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Call of Booty.

229
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,640
They need to make that porn.

230
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
I know, totally.

231
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
It would not be as great as the porn.

232
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,800
Oh, porn tangent!

233
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Sound the alarm.

234
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Woop woop!

235
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,520
Okay, so we're at Loki's house, right?

236
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,220
And uh, Loki has tons, just so y'all know, Loki and the Mrs. have tons and tons and tons

237
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,360
of pornography stored on their Xbox.

238
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,600
But it's not like real- It's actually on my PC, but we stream it.

239
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Whatever.

240
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,760
It's not real porn.

241
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,040
It's all like funny porn.

242
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,120
And we watched a porno called Not the Cosby's- No, there's lots of real porn on there too,

243
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
but we watched funny porn.

244
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
We watched funny ones.

245
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Okay.

246
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
That's just inappropriate.

247
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
You don't just whip out normal porn.

248
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Oh, okay.

249
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Sorry.

250
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Having a dinner party.

251
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
Hey, look, wow!

252
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
I'm such a 12-year-old.

253
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
I know you are.

254
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,720
All right, if you want to see her 12-year-old antics, join her tear room.

255
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,660
We were watching Not the Cosby's 2, which were all these Cosby family lookalikes, and

256
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,600
they were like having sex, but not really with each other.

257
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,720
There were all these like get- But the weird thing about it to me was that there was like

258
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,440
15 minutes of setup and like parity to the plot.

259
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,240
And it was very- It was probably the longest intro I've ever

260
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
seen where it was actually just dialogue.

261
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,720
I like how my gaming helped turn to porn.

262
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,160
I just want to say it was also very disturbing that there was a Rudy.

263
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,560
There is already a Call of Booty, actually.

264
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Is there really?

265
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,880
It is Call of Booty, Modern Horror Fair.

266
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,460
Ah, of course, Modern Horror Fair.

267
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
My bad.

268
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,460
Ah, yes.

269
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,440
God bless the porn industry.

270
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Amen.

271
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,480
Speaking of video games and porn, and we covered this on Comic Insanity this morning because

272
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,760
it was WTF news.

273
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:13,880
Some guy on RPG Maker 3000 made Marvel Brothel, where Professor X decides that instead of

274
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,680
bridging the gap between humans and mutants, instead of sending out his heroines to go

275
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,880
help people, he's going to pimp them out.

276
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,920
I had a story coming up on that later.

277
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
You did?

278
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
That's all right.

279
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Nobody cared.

280
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
It's all right.

281
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
I didn't know.

282
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Here's the deal, guys.

283
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Here's the deal, guys.

284
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,680
When I report it as news later on in the second half of the show, I want you all to act surprised.

285
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,840
You've never heard about this before.

286
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,320
This is totally new information.

287
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Okay.

288
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
So just- I'm sorry.

289
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
No, it's okay.

290
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Just everybody just make me feel important.

291
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,920
And when I talk about this in the second half, I want you all to pretend you've never heard

292
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
about this before.

293
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Anyway, continue.

294
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Pretend Rob's covered in angry ticks.

295
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Oh, well, Rob.

296
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
You're buzzing.

297
00:11:51,920 --> 00:12:01,720
Anyways, yeah, they look- the guy that they have playing Bill Cosby is just a ringer for

298
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Bill Cosby.

299
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
He's a comedian, though, so he doesn't actually do any of the porn in there.

300
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,640
He takes the high road, I guess, but no, but seriously, though, the guy looks and sounds

301
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
like Bill Cosby.

302
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
It's just weird.

303
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
He does.

304
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
It's kind of scary.

305
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,600
And then I was really disturbed by the fact there was a Rudy, but at least I didn't see

306
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,720
her naked, even though I'm sure she was 18.

307
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,640
I mean, that would just be wrong.

308
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,400
But there was- I think Denise was the only one I saw.

309
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,440
Who went off to college in a different world?

310
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Okay, that was Denise.

311
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,840
Denise got banged in one of the scenes, and that's the one we watched.

312
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,980
And I was like, okay, yeah, all right, turn it off.

313
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,360
And then we watched Harry Potter, God of the Little Fire with Netflix- or Netflix with

314
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Riff Tracks.

315
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
That has to be funny.

316
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,000
I watched part of Avatar with Riff Tracks.

317
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That was pretty funny.

318
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,400
I know I played other stuff.

319
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:55,040
I played Robot Unicorn Attack in the middle of Starbucks again, which is pretty fun.

320
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,280
And yeah, that's Carl of Duty.

321
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Yeah, Tigerclaw linked me to this.

322
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Carl of Duty.

323
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I've seen that.

324
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
It's Black Cops, and it's Carl from Family Matters.

325
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,160
And it's very badly photoshopped.

326
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,800
Which, funny enough, when we were watching this Not The Cosbys thing, I said, when are

327
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,680
they going to do the one with Family Matters, but they will actually have the daughter from

328
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Family Matters.

329
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,360
Oh, she's doing porn?

330
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Yeah.

331
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
The middle one.

332
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,520
That'd be tough, because they had also done the same thing with Saved by the Bell, but

333
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
they didn't.

334
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,600
Instead, they chose to have really funny wigs on them.

335
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,320
And Rob, I totally saw something that made me think of you.

336
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,080
The Showgirls Anniversary Edition.

337
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
I bought it.

338
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,680
Damn it, now I can't buy it for you.

339
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
I'm sorry.

340
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Which anniversary?

341
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Blu-ray, whatever.

342
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
15th, I think.

343
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,800
Is it sad that I know that?

344
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Yes it is.

345
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Anyhow, video games.

346
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Yes, your gaming wig.

347
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,560
What else did you want to talk about?

348
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
No.

349
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,720
Loki, how was your gaming wig?

350
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,280
I didn't play a whole lot.

351
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,680
Mainly just Grand Theft Auto, and then the Kinect stuff, I played a little bit of Dance

352
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,240
Central because it was odd.

353
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,280
My living room was big enough to play, you know, Kinect Adventures at one time, but somehow

354
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,100
I guess it shrunk.

355
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,760
Or maybe I didn't calibrate my system again since I switched TVs.

356
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,960
But for whatever reason, I couldn't play Kinect Adventures because it kept saying that I was

357
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,420
too close to the camera even though I was, you know, several feet away.

358
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,000
So you ended up playing Dance Central, and it's fun.

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,600
I tried playing some of the harder songs, like Poison, and I tried it on Medium, and

360
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
I'm sorry.

361
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,400
When it asked me to do the Charleston, I just was like, I'm not following this.

362
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,080
I do not have the coordination to do what they wanted me to do.

363
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,840
I know how to do that dance.

364
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Well good.

365
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,080
I finished that part of the song, but this is the rest of it.

366
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,600
Oh, and everybody had fun laughing at me because I had to do the, like, I don't know, they

367
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,840
called it the poison where you're like, I don't know.

368
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
It's hard to describe.

369
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,000
But yeah, I haven't really played too much on that, and actually I had to go back and

370
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,680
play them again because I had all my stuff saved on my just offline account that's on

371
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
that system.

372
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,720
Because it's a pain in the ass because I use a different system at work, and so I have

373
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,840
to constantly, you know, because god forbid they make it simple, you know, to move your

374
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,120
profile back and forth between two systems.

375
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,720
Oh no, you have to recover it between systems.

376
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,220
That is a little ridiculous.

377
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,840
I mean, it should be as easy as putting in your username and password, and they'll make

378
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,280
it so easy to go to friends' houses and, you know, do the rock band thing or whatever.

379
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Exactly.

380
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
Connect.

381
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,480
Or, or, a memory card, you know, because that works with a memory card if you play offline.

382
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,640
But as soon as you connect it to live, oh I'm sorry, this is not meant for this system,

383
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,800
you need to recover your profile.

384
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
And your profile is not that big.

385
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,000
I mean, it's a few megs at the most.

386
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,960
But it takes like a goddamn half hour to download.

387
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,680
It takes forever to go through this step.

388
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,240
Well, I don't know about a half hour, because Alan and I kind of have to do that a lot.

389
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,800
It took me ten minutes, and I have a really fast internet connection, so it's just, it

390
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,360
doesn't matter how fast your connection is, it just takes forever to download a stupid,

391
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,880
you know, ten meg file or whatever.

392
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
It just, it's very inconvenient.

393
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,600
That's why I haven't really done that yet.

394
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,880
I just need to get rid of my other system and then, you know, go from there.

395
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Good times.

396
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,240
And then other than stuff on there, I played some iOS games.

397
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,200
I just played a little bit of rock band, and that's kind of fun.

398
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,920
And you know, it kind of makes me wish I had like an O2 jam game or something like that

399
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:44,160
on a, or a DJ Maxx or something like that on the iPhone or iPod, that'd be kind of cool.

400
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,160
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

401
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,280
I'll get into my gaming week, then I'll let Alan have a shot, although I know he watched

402
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,560
me play a lot of this stuff, so maybe he'll want to chime in, I don't know.

403
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,240
But I was playing a little bit of Dance Masters, which Logie was kind enough to loan me, and

404
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,480
I thought I brought, didn't I put it in the car, I was going to bring it back to him?

405
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
I don't know.

406
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
Yeah, you grabbed something.

407
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,680
I had no big deal if you didn't.

408
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,280
I played a little bit of Dance Masters, which is, is, it's okay.

409
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,520
You know, again, I like the look of it a little better than Dance Central.

410
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,080
I do really like the look of the game.

411
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,800
But the song list, I mean, and I know this sounds kind of cannibalistic, seeing as our

412
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,300
show kind of started on the whole DDR thing, but the song list kind of blows.

413
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,040
Like there's a few cute songs, especially from the DDR days that are on there.

414
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,320
But as far as the Para dances go, I only caught like two Avex songs on there.

415
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,960
I mean, all the dances are definitely Para inspired, even the ones that didn't originally

416
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,200
come from that game.

417
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
But I only caught Night of Fire in yesterday.

418
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,960
Did you unlock any songs?

419
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
A few.

420
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
I haven't done a ton.

421
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,920
Because I've seen the full track list and yeah, it's a lot of DDR stuff, but I was just

422
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,540
surprised like to see like Afro Nova Primeval on there.

423
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,240
Why is it always got to be Primeval?

424
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,880
I mean, seriously, why can't you just put the regular Afro Nova?

425
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,060
I mean, I don't understand.

426
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,680
But the exotic ethnic dance is funny.

427
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,460
Well, I know though that a lot of the dances that were in there, you're saying look Para

428
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,640
influenced their Tek Para.

429
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,160
Well, I know like the exotic ethnic one, if you've ever heard that song is a very like

430
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,240
Egyptian kind of sounding song and you do like all these little like walk like an Egyptian

431
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,160
moves that are really stupid.

432
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,680
But yeah, Loki at the nail on the head, we talked about this game last night or last

433
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
week.

434
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,840
How are you supposed to learn these dances?

435
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,440
There's no break it down type of mode or anything.

436
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,040
I mean, easy, unlike Dance Central, easy, medium and hard are all the same dance.

437
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,840
It's just that you have more you have to hit.

438
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,240
So I think that's how it wants you to learn it is that you have to do the silhouettes

439
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
and easy.

440
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,280
And then you have to add some of the circles and medium and then as I think that's how

441
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
you learn.

442
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm not sure if it's as effective as Dance Central was.

443
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Just watching you play some of those dance master songs.

444
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,920
I didn't know how you were doing it.

445
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,420
And I know that you were playing them on expert.

446
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,120
But I was I mean, I could see you mimicking what was on the screen, but it was so fast.

447
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,880
I was like, how are you doing this?

448
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,980
Like I could I didn't understand you just memorize it, you memorize dance.

449
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,040
It's just the silhouettes is all that you're really mimicking.

450
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
It's basically learn to Para Para really quickly.

451
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,760
Act Definitely in our chat room says Primeval is from Dance Maniacs slash Freaks, which

452
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,160
is Para Para-esque.

453
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,920
I doubt it would be the same dance, though.

454
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,160
I mean, so you got to see what some of these things look like.

455
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,720
I just the whole like wax on wax off dancing wouldn't work.

456
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
There's lots of Sailor Moon sort of salutes.

457
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,760
Yeah, there are.

458
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,640
There's a lot of cute chibi things in the game.

459
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,380
So I mean, and here's the other thing.

460
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:28,800
And I know they've said, you know, numerous times, oh, this time around, we're going to

461
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,200
really support download content.

462
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Don't see anything yet.

463
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Yeah, exactly.

464
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,280
Um, I just don't believe them.

465
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,000
I mean, at this point, I don't believe them at all, because they said the same thing with

466
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,800
Karaoke Revolution.

467
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,320
Was there a lot of download content for that?

468
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,800
That came out what, a year ago?

469
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,840
Yeah, maybe like a couple months, but that's it.

470
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,720
I also played a little more Dance Central as Loki did, just trying to do some of the

471
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
harder dances.

472
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,260
And yeah, some of them get pretty funny.

473
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,600
I'm sure Alan had a great time watching me do the Come on, Ride the Train dance.

474
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,120
I wanted to try that one, but...

475
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,280
You actually get to go choo-choo a lot in it.

476
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Awesome.

477
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Yes, you go choo-choo.

478
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,880
And I think Alan was practically pointing and laughing the whole time.

479
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
It was pretty funny.

480
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,640
But yeah, he didn't play.

481
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,160
A new Kinect game I tried this week was Kinect Joyride.

482
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,320
I played the demo a little bit.

483
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,880
Why are you laughing?

484
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,600
The color of your car.

485
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Oh.

486
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,200
Wait, you saw the color of your car thing?

487
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
That was dumb.

488
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,080
It was the most fun I had playing the game.

489
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Really?

490
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,680
Maybe I don't want to share why, maybe Alan will, but I'm not sharing why it was the most

491
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
fun part of the game.

492
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:40,240
Well, if it's anything like what we did, then yes, it probably...

493
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,040
And it required my wife standing on the couch, but that's another story.

494
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,040
No, it's seriously the, you know, it's all pick a color, I'm like, I just want to pick

495
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
red.

496
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,360
I don't want to have to find something red in my house.

497
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,280
I just want to pick red.

498
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,840
Or pick green.

499
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
It's all, no, pick something in the camera.

500
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,200
And you've seen like, you know, webcams and how they're getting very pixelated and the

501
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,360
color's kind of off.

502
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,480
Everything ends up being like a palish white.

503
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Or pink.

504
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,700
Or like purple.

505
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,520
No matter whatever the color is.

506
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:17,040
I definitely got a pale pink color.

507
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,000
You went for ass pink?

508
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,600
Something like that, yeah.

509
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,120
Anyhow, so there was that.

510
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,920
And then, but then it went black for a second.

511
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,600
I just realized it captured my asshole.

512
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,360
Anyway, kidding.

513
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,960
Except I'm not.

514
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,440
Let's see.

515
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,640
So yeah, I played Joyride and it was, it was dopey.

516
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,000
I didn't like it at all.

517
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,200
I thought Mario Kart controlled better on the Wii.

518
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,320
Watching you play it, it looked like it had a pretty steep learning curve.

519
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,520
Because when it looked, at first couple minutes you were sort of all over the place.

520
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,960
And I was like, this game looks like it controls horribly.

521
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,760
And you said that it kind of did.

522
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,000
But by the end, by like the third or fourth lap, you were reading a lot better.

523
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,840
So I just think it has a, it might have a little learning curve to it.

524
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
I don't know.

525
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
I just, I did the demo.

526
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,400
And granted, I didn't, I only played the demo and I shouldn't base in person with the Game

527
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,480
of Demo.

528
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,040
But I, the demo did not leave me wanting to get the full game.

529
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,200
I got the full game.

530
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Did you?

531
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Did you like it better than the demo?

532
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
I actually haven't played the full game yet.

533
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,000
I also haven't played Kinect Sports yet.

534
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's the other game that I got.

535
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,040
But I haven't played that yet.

536
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm worried that it's not gonna, it's gonna say, well, sorry, your living room is too

537
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
small.

538
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Again.

539
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,280
Um, let's see, what else did I play this week?

540
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,040
Um, I was, most, I mean, otherwise the same old stuff, Warcraft, Rock Band 3, I've been

541
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
playing more of that.

542
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,880
I wanna try the Your Shape Fitness demo.

543
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,680
Is there a demo on the Adventures disc?

544
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Yeah.

545
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Oh.

546
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,320
If you put the disc in and go to your, um, you know, you can either go in there and play

547
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,400
the demo or you can just do it through your actual demo channel thing.

548
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,800
Um, so yeah, other than the dance games and that, that was pretty much it.

549
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,160
Not a lot of new stuff this week.

550
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,680
So maybe, maybe next week.

551
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,040
That was, that was the one big game.

552
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,840
Otherwise I've been playing the stuff I have.

553
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,360
Which is novel for me.

554
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,920
Uh, Alan, anything you want to add for your gaming week?

555
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,040
Just World of Warcraft.

556
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
More and more.

557
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,840
What's going on in your WoW worlds these days?

558
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,280
I've sort of set up these goals for myself to accomplish by the time Cataclysm comes

559
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,120
out and they're not necessarily things that are going away when Cataclysm comes out.

560
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,000
Um, it's just stuff that, uh, to keep me busy, occupied for the last four weeks.

561
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,960
Um, but yeah, I'm trying to get a hundred mounts to get that reward.

562
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,800
Good time.

563
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,760
Because once it comes out, I'm going to be looking at all the new content and I'm not

564
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,680
going to be able to grind all that stupid stuff.

565
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,260
So that's what I'm doing now.

566
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,080
Is there anything this holiday season that you're looking forward to besides Cataclysm?

567
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,200
I haven't really been following the releases because I can't, you know, I usually buy that

568
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
stuff for myself, so I don't, not following it really.

569
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
So all right.

570
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,360
Well, maybe you can find good deals on last year's holiday releases or just watch Steam.

571
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,960
Oh yeah, Steam I'm sure is going to have, you know, eight games for 10 cents or whatever

572
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,520
their Christmas sale is and I'll be like, sure, I'll pick up some stuff.

573
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Exactly.

574
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
All right.

575
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,120
Anyhow, uh, let's get into some quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's gaming news.

576
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,400
Um, not a whole lot of housekeeping tonight.

577
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,720
I will just say please join our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange launch radio.

578
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,600
Or of course you can follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R. Um, otherwise

579
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,480
I don't think I have a whole lot to report tonight.

580
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,720
Um, there's a, the spinoff shows, the dark soccer and myself have dark soccer.

581
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,880
I host a show called comic insant co-hosts, a show called comic insanity.

582
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,920
Uh, just drop the I and you can find them on iTunes and infamous.net.

583
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
That's right.

584
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,160
And uh, the official first episode of the new podcast I'm doing with extra for, if you

585
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,760
like Warcraft talk, I would let Alan go on forever, but there's a whole new show for

586
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
that now.

587
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,100
It's a hoard house, the best little hoard house in Azeroth.

588
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
It's not on iTunes yet.

589
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
We're trying to get it there.

590
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,520
Uh, but more information is available.

591
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,720
There's a link on our Twitter.

592
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,360
We have a Twitter over there too, twitter.com slash hoard house.

593
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,440
So that's our spinoff projects.

594
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,600
Probably won't end there.

595
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,240
Maybe Loki will get up a side project soon enough.

596
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Who knows?

597
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
And who knows what else is going to happen.

598
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Yeah.

599
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
When am I going to have time for a side project?

600
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Seriously.

601
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Raising a baby 101.

602
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
All right.

603
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,280
Uh, let's move on with some gaming news.

604
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Loki.

605
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
There's always time for gaming news at least.

606
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Yes, there is.

607
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,100
Um, of course, you know, the news came out this week that harmonics is being sold by

608
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,380
Viacom.

609
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,320
The question in everybody's mind is to whom?

610
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:35,560
Um, of course, you know, EA sounds like a likely candidate because for one, they've

611
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:42,360
been publishing their games lately and two, they seem to like snap up, um, you know, popular

612
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
developers.

613
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,840
I mean, they did the same thing with valve and with a bunch of other ones.

614
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,400
I mean, they have literally a slew of development houses working on games for them.

615
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,720
So, uh, it seems like it might be likely other things that people have thrown out there that

616
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,440
might be interesting possible candidates, Microsoft, which would be really interesting

617
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
if that happened.

618
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:10,280
Um, cause then they would have basically rock band to themselves should be very strange.

619
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,560
Um, and then possibly Activision, but God, I hope that doesn't happen.

620
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,320
A lot of people in our chat room yelling out Konami.

621
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,120
Nah, they don't have enough money.

622
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,000
Konami would be bought up by, like, another company, you know, they, I mean, seriously,

623
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,840
what big titles do they have coming out each year?

624
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,640
Pro Evolution Soccer.

625
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
That's basically it.

626
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,000
I mean, you know, there are other titles, you know, top titles that they have coming

627
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
out.

628
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,800
Yeah, they have a DDR game.

629
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,120
By the way, I think Dance Dance Revolution came out this week on PlayStation 3 and Wii.

630
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Oh, congrats, I guess.

631
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
Um, yeah.

632
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,240
Uh, that made a big splash.

633
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Really?

634
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,560
Um, you know, Dance Masters, but those aren't really going to make them a ton of money,

635
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
I think.

636
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,480
Tiger Claws throwing out Ubisoft.

637
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,800
I don't know if Ubisoft would do that.

638
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,100
I mean, they have their own music stuff, and I don't know if they're big enough to where

639
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,640
they'd be purchasing this stuff.

640
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,000
If anything, it's probably going to be EA, cause they've got-

641
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,180
Okay, X-Link says Atlus.

642
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,180
Come on, guys.

643
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
Now you're just reaching.

644
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
I don't think-

645
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
That's just retarded.

646
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Squeenix Eidos.

647
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
Squeenix.

648
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,040
Squeenix Eidos Harmonix.

649
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,760
Final Fantasy Dance Master, whatever.

650
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
Oh my gosh.

651
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,640
Um, so, other things, you know, you may be concerned because they're being sold and stuff.

652
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,040
What's that mean about the download content, um, that's going to be coming out for these

653
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
games?

654
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,360
Well, apparently it's not going to interrupt the download content that's going on.

655
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,340
Uh, they've already been working on stuff, and that's not going to be affected by the

656
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,340
sale at all.

657
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
So, uh-

658
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,840
They work on that stuff, like, four months out.

659
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,600
So, they're set through the holidays, at least.

660
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Yeah.

661
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,080
So, that's- nothing's really going anywhere there.

662
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,040
Um, and then, of course, also, if you are interested in purchasing some new download

663
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,200
content for Rock Band 2, you may not be able to do that anymore.

664
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:06,440
In fact, actually, all Rock Band tracks, both DLC and, um, I guess, uh, yeah, just the DLC

665
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,120
is actually going to be incompatible with Rock Band 1 and 2.

666
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,160
It says apparently the Rock Band Network tracks will be compatible with all versions.

667
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,560
So at least you have an avenue for that stuff until, I guess, they update the software for

668
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
that.

669
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,680
Um, so you will need to upgrade to Rock Band 3.

670
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,920
Please don't tell me people are bitching about this.

671
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,760
Like, are people seriously bitching that, uh, that they're not backwards compatible

672
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
anymore?

673
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
Some people, I guess.

674
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
I don't know.

675
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,000
Um, the other thing, too, is they're also adding, um, updates for other tracks, um,

676
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,320
old download content.

677
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,520
They're adding legacy support to be able to allow you to play those songs with keyboards,

678
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,960
uh, pro guitars, uh, pro bass, that kind of stuff.

679
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,600
Uh, it's gonna cost you $2 to pay for the new Rock Band 3 version of the songs if you'd

680
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,240
like to have keyboard and harmony upgrades.

681
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,120
If you want pro guitar, bass versions of those songs, you're gonna need to buy, um, or need

682
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,000
to purchase the pro upgrade, which will be for another dollar.

683
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,400
So $3 for, um, an upgrade for these songs.

684
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,040
Um, and that's each song, by the way.

685
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,920
Um, so yeah.

686
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,400
It's very interesting stuff.

687
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,920
Sorry, I got distracted because I got an email.

688
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,320
I'm not allowed to say it because it's under non-disclosure agreement, but I just got into

689
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,600
a beta I've been waiting to get into for months and months and months and months, so I'm like

690
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
eeee.

691
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Sorry.

692
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,720
Invite, please.

693
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,620
If I'm shaking, I'll try, but it's under NDA, so I can't say anything more about it,

694
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,520
but I'm, um, shaking and crying over here.

695
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
My bad.

696
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
I'm sorry, I know everybody hates that.

697
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,480
I know something you don't know, guy, but that's why I'm distracted.

698
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm just telling y'all I have an excuse.

699
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
I have a very good excuse.

700
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Is it for Naughty Bear 2?

701
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
I know.

702
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,320
Yes, it's for Naughty Bear 2, okay, now they're gonna boot me, I'm so, so sad.

703
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,560
It's for Final Fantasy XIV.

704
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,120
Oh wait, I'm sorry, that's just a regular subscription.

705
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,040
No, that's just called buying the PC version.

706
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,480
I like how they, this one didn't make their show roll or whatever, but I like how they

707
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,920
came out and said, yeah, we understand that the game's terrible.

708
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,240
We're working on it, though.

709
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,000
It's like, that doesn't excuse the fact that you put the game out and it's terrible.

710
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,360
Um, so I wanted to say also about the developer situation and Harmonix getting sold and all

711
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,240
that stuff, I don't think this is quite the end of the world, I think some people are

712
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
making it out to be.

713
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
No.

714
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,760
Harmonix is still, I mean, they are very well respected in the industry.

715
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,880
They do a lot of great stuff.

716
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,600
I do think losing the relationship with MTV Games is gonna be a bummer for them because

717
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,960
I think that's part of what's pushed that Rock Band DLC to the next level, but let's

718
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:45,600
face it, Rock Band DLC has always been, like, above and beyond like any other game and their

719
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
supported DLC.

720
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,560
And it's a household name now, I don't really think that people need to convince, you know,

721
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,240
they don't need the MTV backing to convince bands to be in Rock Band.

722
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Yeah.

723
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,840
I mean, they have plenty of history and plenty of, you know, data to show them, hey, look,

724
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,400
you'll see DLC on this, you know, cells and you'll make some money or, you know, it's

725
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
worthwhile.

726
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
So.

727
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,720
Um, yeah, so, I don't think it's the end of the world for them.

728
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,200
I don't know if we'll hear much through this holiday season, but, you know, I don't know

729
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,680
if we'll hear about a change of hands just before Christmas, but I think probably in

730
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
the new year.

731
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,440
But I wouldn't, I wouldn't say Doom and Gloom for the Rock Band franchise yet.

732
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,240
I think it'll still sell well through the holidays, too.

733
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,920
I can't believe people are already saying this game is a sales failure.

734
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,840
People have been saying before these games even came out, they've been saying music games

735
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
are over.

736
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,680
Music games will never be over.

737
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
People are dumb.

738
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,140
They're like, well, I can't take it to the plastic instrument.

739
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,440
You don't have to fucking buy another plastic instrument for every goddamn game that comes

740
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
out.

741
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,240
Why are you buying multiple plastic instruments for these things?

742
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,880
Um, music games might not be the next big fad anymore, but music games are a long way

743
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,520
from going out.

744
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,840
We'll always have Glee.

745
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,400
It's things like Glee that will kill different franchises for certain people, like, you know.

746
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,360
Well, isn't it kind of sad that it was probably Activision saturating the market that ruined

747
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,440
it for, you know, because most people can't tell the difference between guitar hero and

748
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,440
rock band.

749
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
I don't think it really ruined it for anybody.

750
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
I mean, people can see through.

751
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,760
If there's a lot of games coming out, say, for guitar hero or whatever, I mean, sure

752
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,840
people get jaded about the fact that, you know, oh, they're just out for money.

753
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,040
And you know, Green Day Rock Band kind of seemed like, oh, they're out for money.

754
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,640
You know, instead of saying, oh, it's the Green Day Rock Band track pack or something

755
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
like that.

756
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,600
And, you know, they used to do track packs where they'd put stuff out and there'd be

757
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,320
some download content that you could get and play, you know, before, you know, it hits

758
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,080
the, you know, service or whatever.

759
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,800
Or you could play these games, you know, standalone by themselves and, you know, it's like twenty

760
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,320
bucks for a game versus, you know, full price.

761
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,480
Rama in our chat room is asking, Loki, question, do you think that the music games are declining?

762
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Are they declining?

763
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,560
I don't think so.

764
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,080
I mean, I think...

765
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,560
I think Rock Band 3, sorry, I'm cutting you off and interjecting my own answer, but whatever.

766
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,800
Rock Band 3 is definitely a step above Rock Band 2 and it's a worthy upgrade.

767
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,100
DJ Hero 2 is a worthy step above DJ Hero 1.

768
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:19,040
I think maybe there might be room to do something more original, but at the same time, don't

769
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,440
put another plastic instrument in my house.

770
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,800
Yeah, and that being said, also though, you know, Rock Band 3 did introduce the keyboards,

771
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,000
which I don't see that as a bad thing.

772
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,600
It's not like we're, you know, first off, it's not required that you have a keyboard.

773
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,860
If it's something that you want, then you can pick it up.

774
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,080
You don't need to necessarily go and buy, you know, some brand new stuff.

775
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,140
And the instruments that they released this year, because they do have standalone instruments

776
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,360
for Rock Band 3, they're not really, other than the pro, you know, the pro guitar that

777
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,360
they have out there, and then the guitar that's a real guitar, other than those optional instruments,

778
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,360
all the instruments are the same.

779
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,480
Dan was just saying today how he wanted the wireless Logitech guitar controller.

780
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
What for?

781
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Just for- For Rock Band?

782
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,800
No, he wants it.

783
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Okay.

784
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,660
The higher quality, better made, but he pointed it out and said, this is what I want.

785
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,860
So I think that the whole plastic instrument thing argument can go right down the toilet

786
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,240
because an enthusiast is gonna buy them.

787
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
I have a guitar.

788
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,680
I have a Fender guitar that's actually a wood guitar that's made for Rock Band.

789
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,720
It was a $300 guitar at one time, got it for a third of the price, but it's pretty awesome.

790
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,040
Let me ask this question when you guys talk about music games dying and all this stuff.

791
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,520
Would you consider Child of Eden a music game?

792
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
No.

793
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,680
I never really consider Child of Eden.

794
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,520
No, you know what I'm talking about, or is it Children of Eden?

795
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,960
I've never really considered it.

796
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
And I have that preordered.

797
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,380
I cannot wait to get that game.

798
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,400
But Children of Eden, you know, the rezzy- Yeah, but I never considered it.

799
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Like you never- you don't want to buy it?

800
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,920
You're not interested in it at all?

801
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,280
No, just- I keep forgetting about it because I have a lot of other stuff going on.

802
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,880
Well, it's not also gonna be out this year anyway.

803
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,360
Yeah, it's like I haven't really bothered to think about it until it comes an option

804
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,720
for me to be able to get.

805
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,780
Well, the reason why I'm throwing that out there is because maybe we're looking at an

806
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,980
evolution of music games or something new, and I think that's just what the music game

807
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,180
genre needs is something new that's interesting.

808
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:27,840
And this whole connect slash move slash, you know, whatever, 3DS even, is, you know, could

809
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,600
bring us kind of the next interesting thing in gaming.

810
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,040
But as far as the whole plastic guitars and drums, I think there's only so much you can

811
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,960
do with that, and it's really hard to surpass what Rock Band 3 is bringing to the table.

812
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,080
It is, and that's- And honestly, Rock Band 3's features aren't

813
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
for everyone.

814
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,880
That's, and it's basically the response, you know, both companies, both Harmonix and both

815
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,960
Activision, understand that, you know, maybe their sales are taking a hit a little bit

816
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,840
and the music games aren't exactly as, I should say, not necessarily as popular, but aren't

817
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,800
making as big of a splash anymore as, you know, they were previously.

818
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,880
And with Rock Band, though, they haven't really been trying to put out tons of releases.

819
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,480
I mean, the Green Day thing was kind of a one-off thing, and then the Beatles, that

820
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,640
was kind of something different, where it was mainly, that was just gonna be all-inclusive

821
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
in it.

822
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,960
And yeah, I know they had the Lego Rock Band game, but that was more of a grab to try to

823
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,480
get the family audience in there.

824
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,120
It also wasn't Harmonix.

825
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,240
Well, they developed it, but it was Warner Brothers, yeah, that published it.

826
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,680
I thought another developer kind of took the Rock Band code and did it.

827
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Yeah, I know what you mean.

828
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
You're Traveler's Hills, yeah.

829
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Yeah, yeah.

830
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
That's it.

831
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
But anyways.

832
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,000
But that game had an awesome soundtrack, and I, you know-

833
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,240
I'm actually trying to find a copy of Lego Rock Band for super cheap.

834
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,640
I think I could just order it on Amazon for, like, 14 bucks, just to get the songs in my

835
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Rock Band 3 collection.

836
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,720
It really is worth it.

837
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,920
But other than that, I mean, they've kind of taken it two different routes.

838
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,560
You know, Guitar Hero decided this year that they're gonna go back to their roots.

839
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:03,880
They said to make it all about rock, and that's cool and all, and they had a decent tracklist

840
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,040
and stuff like that, but it's not, like, that big a deal.

841
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,480
I mean, if you like the songs, cool, and you can buy them and, you know, upgrade and stuff

842
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,280
like that, but it's not like it's adding new ways to play the game other than this quest

843
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,800
mode that- and they had, like, challenges per songs and stuff like that, download content.

844
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,520
That's neat, but it's just- it doesn't seem like a lot worse.

845
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,240
Rock Band 3, they went ahead, added new instruments, new pro modes, new lessons and stuff like

846
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,460
that, you know, harmonies, just a bunch of stuff to it.

847
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,880
And plus it has a library of thousands of songs.

848
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,200
Let me throw this out there, too, speaking of this whole, like, next evolution of the

849
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,760
music-based game and so forth, is, you know, think about this, too.

850
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,820
I think you have to consider this a music game.

851
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,840
What is the number one Kinect title gonna be this holiday season, besides Kinect Adventures,

852
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
the pack-in game?

853
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Dance Central.

854
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
It's gonna be Dance Central.

855
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,160
Dance Central made by Harmonics, so, you know, that's gonna be a big thing for them, I think,

856
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,280
and you know, even if not everybody is into dancing, it just shows you there are other

857
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,040
things that haven't been done yet that can't be done.

858
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,880
We've already got download content for it.

859
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
No.

860
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,880
Alright.

861
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Anyway, let's move on.

862
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,280
Sorry, I don't want to spend too much time on this, but, you know, we have a soft spot

863
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,680
for music-based games here at OLR, so.

864
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,400
Speaking of the Kinect, though, this is somewhat interesting slash exciting, a new open source

865
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,840
Kinect camera driver has been released.

866
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,840
So, you know, ever since the Kinect came out, it's been everybody's job to try and hack

867
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,640
it slash crack it, although some people have criticized me, like, earlier this evening

868
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,880
about my usage of that term, whatever you want to call it.

869
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,680
People are using the Kinect for their own purposes on the PC.

870
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:50,080
A hacker by the name of Hector Martin has managed to do basically what the NUI groups

871
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,960
Alex P announced that they did, the whole Kinect functionality versus the PC.

872
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,640
Martin released his code out to the public, so you can actually see what that looks like

873
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,860
when you're running it there.

874
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,880
They have, like, a little YouTube up right there, and you can, all it does right now

875
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:12,240
is it displays what the Kinect quote unquote sees right now, kind of using little RGB.

876
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,800
It looks like one of those, like, thermal cams, when you're kind of looking at what

877
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
it sees.

878
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,960
So, very interesting that the driver is out there.

879
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,440
Kind of strange that if this will run on a PC, which, since it's USB, I think we all

880
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,880
figured it would, kind of interesting that Microsoft just didn't try to jump on it for

881
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
its own purposes.

882
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,440
I mean, why would Microsoft pigeonhole the Kinect for, well, I guess it makes sense,

883
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,280
because they want to sell more 360s.

884
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,480
But now that this is kind of out there, why doesn't Microsoft take advantage of this for

885
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,400
their own purposes and try to put out Kinect PC games and fitness-type games for the PC?

886
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I don't know.

887
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Am I crazy?

888
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,720
So, anyhow, also something to throw out there is that there is now a Homebrew PC Kinect

889
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,820
photo app that is out there.

890
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,540
It's by the coder Flowemuc, Flowemuc?

891
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,040
It's a proof of concept, what they call application, and there's another YouTube video out there

892
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:08,480
using Kinect to track the hand movements, manipulating, resizing photos.

893
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,360
He has not released the software yet, but it's out there on YouTube, so there it is.

894
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,400
And this is all done within the course of a few weeks, so imagine what we're going to

895
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,120
be looking at early next year, as far as PC Homebrew stuff goes.

896
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,080
I guess people have more free time than I do, anyway.

897
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,400
Hey, you know what, though?

898
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,520
Better your free time on this than, I don't know, World of Warcraft.

899
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Says the addict.

900
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,840
Or Star Trek Online.

901
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,520
Which I play maybe once a week.

902
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Okay, justify, justify, justify.

903
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,600
For 18 hours at a stretch.

904
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
No.

905
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,280
More like one or two.

906
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,640
Mr. I have scheduled raids on Wednesday.

907
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,360
This week, we'll see.

908
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
Scheduled raids.

909
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,920
Hanging out with friends, I know them all in real life.

910
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
Scheduled raids.

911
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Almost.

912
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,560
And we can also go out for pizza together.

913
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,280
I didn't go this last- why am I justifying this to you?

914
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
I don't care!

915
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Screw you!

916
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,800
Judge, judge, judge.

917
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,200
Well, how about Nintendo?

918
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,120
This is almost douchey, but not quite.

919
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,320
They trademarked the phrase, it's on like Donkey Kong.

920
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:25,200
Sorry, SSJ100Matt said in chat, I don't know, JB did play Second Life.

921
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,680
I do love the chatters.

922
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,320
Oh yeah, Donkey Kong, hey!

923
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,760
Well, Nintendo owns the phrase now, and pretty much it's gonna be because of Donkey Kong

924
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,160
Country Returns on November 21st.

925
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,400
Their catchphrase, on November 21st, it's on like Donkey Kong.

926
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,240
So they had to trademark the phrase.

927
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,640
I thought that had to be approved and all that stuff by the government first, like they're-

928
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,120
Well, they filed the request.

929
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,680
And apparently, I guess they got it.

930
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,080
It's Nintendo's phrase now.

931
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,440
So now I'm just gonna say it's on like Pong.

932
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,800
Well, I mean, like, I don't even like that saying, to be honest.

933
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,120
No matter where this kind of argument stands, like, I don't even use the phrase, it's on

934
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,000
like Donkey Kong, because you know what?

935
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,320
When it comes to my gaming on the Wii, it's off.

936
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,040
Like I- it's unplugged, actually.

937
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,360
Mine has a layer of dust on it right now.

938
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,400
Yeah, it's sitting in a box somewhere.

939
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,800
I've been playing a lot of stuff on my iPhone.

940
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,600
So yeah, I mean, have fun, I guess, with the trademark.

941
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,600
But I guess if they want to sell shirts or whatever- Didn't the Scott Pilgrim movie use

942
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,640
that in like their trailers and the posters and stuff?

943
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,960
Maybe that's what they were trying to do is, although it's kind of ironic, because it kind

944
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,520
of comes full circle, because there was the whole King Kong thing from Universal, and

945
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,880
Universal has the Scott Pilgrim- well, forget it.

946
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,320
It's actually not that interesting at all.

947
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,160
I'm just rolling my eyes.

948
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
They just want to sell t-shirts.

949
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Yeah.

950
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
So they're just waiting.

951
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
Yeah.

952
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
Damn them.

953
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,160
So.

954
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
It's off.

955
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
I don't care.

956
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,600
You can say it's on like Tron, that makes more sense, because Tron is cooler than Donkey

957
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
Kong.

958
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
It's on like Tron?

959
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
It rhymes!

960
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,960
Donkey Kong Country was an awesome game.

961
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,100
It is an awesome game, and I like how the new game is like, you know, just like the

962
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:37,280
old games, you know, they didn't really try to change it up too much, I guess, hoping

963
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,640
to catch the new Super Mario Brothers crowd, I'm guessing.

964
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,880
Act F in our chat room says, and numerous people are referencing this in chat too, Act

965
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,960
F says, Sky, yeah, the Scott Pilgrim trailers use that phrase.

966
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,040
Don't kid yourself, that's what this is really about.

967
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,640
This isn't, this isn't, uh, never mind.

968
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,280
So we talk about stupid Donkey Kong, that's what it was about.

969
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,280
And we did.

970
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Well it worked!

971
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,320
It was on like CNN, and MSNBC, and like every frickin' news station ran with it.

972
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,880
I feel terrible for contributing to the promotion of that game, so I'm just not gonna buy it.

973
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Alright.

974
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,680
Oh wait, I was gonna not buy it anyway, so that's so funny!

975
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:27,680
A game that people purchased a lot of recently, not Call of Duty, because Call of Duty did

976
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,160
sell a lot as well, but it took Fallout New Vegas just a little bit longer.

977
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:39,920
They did sell five million units as well, and I guess, combined I guess with a heavy

978
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:47,800
volume of digital downloads, the game stands to generate 300 million dollars in sales.

979
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,840
And it says, of course, that they are working to patch the game to fix the numerous bugs

980
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,840
that were in there.

981
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:05,520
Whatever, you know, we can rant on and on about how games get released, unfinished,

982
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:12,120
just so that they can sell them and have people test them, whatever.

983
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,360
So there's gonna be a PC patch coming out soon, I think there was already a patch that's

984
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:21,320
in the works for the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions.

985
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,600
Breakman in our chat room is asking, is Fallout New Vegas fixed yet, kind of I guess a reference

986
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,840
to the story, because that game is broken as fuck, is the quote.

987
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,240
It's not fixed yet.

988
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,440
But it will be soon, don't worry.

989
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,080
You know, you're just gonna have a broken game for a while.

990
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,760
How broken is broken as fuck?

991
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,760
Is it seriously like we're talking no boss shows up on level 30?

992
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,080
They're having save issues, where I think save games are getting erased.

993
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,520
Oh, that sucks.

994
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,000
Is it Cogwheel cursor broken?

995
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,640
Nice, nice reference.

996
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,600
Wow reference, sorry.

997
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:59,100
They're also doing some tweaks for Nvidia graphics card users, and I guess there's some

998
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,480
problems with the Havok drivers.

999
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,840
Casey in our chat room at chat.org.com says, yeah right, you already bought it, why fix

1000
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,320
it?

1001
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,640
They will, I trust that they will, I mean Fallout 3 I think was kind of the same issue,

1002
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,880
they'll have the same issues where it was buggy.

1003
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,000
And you know, even like with Oblivion and stuff, they had a lot of buggy stuff in there

1004
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
that they went and patched.

1005
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,800
I mean, those games are pretty complex, but once again that's still no excuse for testing

1006
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,320
your games.

1007
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,040
But I understand why they release it when they do, because you know, especially towards

1008
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,880
the holidays, getting your game to a duplicator to get it done, I mean there's such a backlog

1009
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:45,040
with duplicators right now that you have to release it then in order to make it out before

1010
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,280
Call of Duty comes out.

1011
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:54,160
But still though, I mean, put a little bit more effort into, you know, testing your games

1012
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,680
for bugs.

1013
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,800
Alright, well, hopefully these games have been very well tested for bugs.

1014
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,680
It's actually a follow up to something we were talking about last week, it's the indie

1015
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,680
games.

1016
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,840
You remember how indie games on Xbox Live, they were kind of shoved under the rug a little

1017
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,720
bit and people were pissed.

1018
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,280
Well, what's interesting is that it's been fixed already, and when I say fixed I mean

1019
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,880
pretty much moved back sort of to where it was before.

1020
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,560
It's now under the games and demos section of the Xbox Live marketplace.

1021
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,840
So yeah, and there was no dashboard update or anything, so they must have done all that

1022
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,360
updating on the server end somehow.

1023
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,360
So yeah, some interesting feedback in the Microsoft forums, there's of course celebrating

1024
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
going on.

1025
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,960
Microsoft is listening, indie games are back in the games section, we are having an effect.

1026
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,440
The new placement isn't perfect, because they want to be front and center, but it's a huge

1027
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,760
step in the right direction.

1028
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,840
The icon feels very out of place being such a different style and in searches and so forth.

1029
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,580
It doesn't look like indie games are included, but we are in the games section.

1030
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:59,820
So congrats, they're back, and you know, it seems like a logical place for them to be,

1031
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,920
and I can see why they were kind of mad the first time.

1032
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,560
But what's also very interesting, not only is it that, there's now going to be this developer

1033
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,960
led initiative going on called Indie Games Winter Uprising.

1034
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,320
It's not quite the same thing that you would think as like Summer of Arcade, because it's

1035
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,520
not Microsoft sponsoring this.

1036
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,240
This is actually a developer enabled thing, but they're going to actually price over a

1037
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,340
dozen games and indie games between 80 to 400 Microsoft points.

1038
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,000
So the developers are going to take a hit to try and bring more notice to the indie

1039
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
games.

1040
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Which means Microsoft takes a cut too.

1041
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,560
But a lot of the indie games are already 80 Microsoft points to 400 Microsoft points.

1042
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,400
So it's not like they're really going to be doing anything.

1043
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,780
Well supposedly these are like big indie titles, I mean I'm not sure exactly what that means.

1044
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:54,200
But yeah, 80 to 400 Microsoft points during the first week of December.

1045
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,520
But you know, what's kind of sad about this though is that how are people going to know

1046
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,920
about this outside of I guess gaming blogs and maybe the gaming hardcore if something

1047
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,680
is not mentioned on the Microsoft dashboard.

1048
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,760
I mean it's kind of a bummer that Microsoft won't say, hey good idea, let's put a little

1049
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,360
banner or something or you know.

1050
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,760
And I think that's kind of what the developers want is they just want Microsoft to throw

1051
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,760
them a bone.

1052
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,400
It's not like Microsoft ain't making money on it.

1053
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,920
Yeah but the problem with these developers though is they're pissed off that there's

1054
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,880
a lot of like cheap crappy games like all these massage apps and stuff like that.

1055
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,960
Hey Babymaker Extreme is awesome.

1056
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,920
But you know what, you just need to suck it up and get over it because that's what there

1057
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,040
is on the stupid Apple app store and stuff like that.

1058
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,200
Just you have to differentiate your product and I understand there's a lot of massage

1059
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,200
apps.

1060
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,040
But people are buying them sadly.

1061
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,800
Unless you're making a massage app, who gives a crap what other massage apps are out there?

1062
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,160
And yes I understand that people are dumb and will buy a lot of them and rate it up

1063
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,920
or whatever and it'll appear at the top of some you know top sellers list and they'll

1064
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,680
just you know keep regurgitating the cycle I guess of bad purchases.

1065
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,880
But you need to do something other than just upload your game and be done with it.

1066
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,840
You need to go market your game.

1067
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,440
You can't just expect people to purchase the game, rate it high and hope that it appears

1068
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,840
at this top list because there's a lot of games coming out.

1069
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,040
I don't ever get contacted by indie developers on this show save for the ones you've already

1070
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,440
heard on this program in the past like YYR and a couple others.

1071
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:32,440
But you know I'm just saying indie developers maybe you need to aim a little lower to like

1072
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:39,240
and I'm not like stop trying to go for the big big coverage and come to like indie shows

1073
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,480
and things like that.

1074
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,320
I will happily have indie developers on the one to pimp their games just send us an email.

1075
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,520
Know what I mean?

1076
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,480
There's plenty of outlets for them to do that kind of stuff.

1077
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,640
So we'll see what happens.

1078
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,480
Dark Soccer what do you have for us before we get into the release dates and then the

1079
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,200
classic end of the week is not that far away either.

1080
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,000
Oh I was making fun of somebody for being wrong on the contest because they didn't listen

1081
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,560
to all the instructions.

1082
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,560
Aww.

1083
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,680
Sorry you lose.

1084
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:14,800
Well Scribblenauts is getting a Japanese release and it's actually just the first one not Super

1085
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,720
Scribblenauts and it's called Flash Puzzle Maxwell's Peculiar Notebook.

1086
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:26,000
Or into the Peculiar it could be mysterious it's Fushigi.

1087
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,320
I love that word Fushigi anyway.

1088
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:36,200
So yeah they are have had to change the 22,000 word dictionary and it's going to be a budget

1089
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,640
release on top of that I mean.

1090
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,640
Interesting.

1091
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,640
Yeah.

1092
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,680
But the speculation is that they're already working on localizing the sequel as well.

1093
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:53,320
No word on if it's being changed as far as aesthetically cosmetically.

1094
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,720
Now when you say localized you mean they are changing as well all of the like words and

1095
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,000
things to be in Japanese language.

1096
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,400
Localizing it for Japan.

1097
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,360
That has got to be a pain in the ass.

1098
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:11,180
Oh yes because I honestly think there's going to have to be more universal memes there used.

1099
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,480
What alphabet are they going to use?

1100
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,040
I would expect that they're going to use the...

1101
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,680
What's that it's Kanji and Katakana?

1102
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,160
I think they're going to use all of them I would hope.

1103
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,840
Probably use the...

1104
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,480
You know how with the iPhone you can actually just type it in either way and it will bring

1105
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,560
up the Kanji dictionary that will let you pick which one.

1106
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,840
Or like using the Shift Jest translate changer on Windows.

1107
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,840
Oh okay.

1108
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,840
Yeah.

1109
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,960
I would expect it would work the same way.

1110
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,440
I wonder if Lolcats are going to be in it and all the other internet memes or if they

1111
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,040
kind of took those out because maybe it's not quite the same.

1112
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,040
President Kat!

1113
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,200
Yeah they should put President Kat in the game that would be awesome.

1114
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,800
But I'm not going to hold my breath.

1115
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,200
Let's travel around the world and look at some releases coming soon to a store near

1116
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,200
you.

1117
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,200
We'll start in the US.

1118
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Loki.

1119
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,360
Still keeping up with lots of releases coming out and I think this is probably going to

1120
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,860
be the last big week and it's going to start dying down.

1121
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:13,080
Today actually was the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini Land Mayhem on the Nintendo

1122
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,080
DS.

1123
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,280
Also this Sunday there was also You Draw.

1124
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,840
Hold on is that that same puzzle game series that started a long time ago on the Game Boy

1125
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Advance?

1126
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,840
The Mario vs. Donkey Kong games?

1127
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,840
Yeah the ones like Lemons.

1128
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,840
Wow.

1129
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,840
I never realized that was such a huge series.

1130
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,120
Well, tell it Nintendo.

1131
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,640
They don't seem to understand.

1132
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,440
Wasn't a bad game the first time.

1133
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,320
It wasn't a bad game but I mean I could think of them developing some other games though

1134
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,440
that might not be so bad.

1135
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
Well if they're selling.

1136
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,040
People like Mario games.

1137
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,720
I mean standard Mario games.

1138
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,720
You don't have to go.

1139
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
It's on like Mario.

1140
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,720
Don't have to go too crazy.

1141
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,320
Some people like myself may like Mario RPG.

1142
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,640
Just a thought.

1143
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,640
You Draw.

1144
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:57,680
They're coming out with the tablet plus the drawing software and then Dude's Big Adventure

1145
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,840
which is some doodling platformer game and Pictionary because everyone loves Pictionary.

1146
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,400
And then of course Pictionary for the DS.

1147
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,400
So that's all today.

1148
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:11,640
And then of course this week we have NBA Jam coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 for

1149
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,640
the almost full price of $50 instead of $60.

1150
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,640
Okay.

1151
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,040
It's $10 cheaper.

1152
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,200
Sims 3 for the Wii kind of delayed from the rest of the other console versions.

1153
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:33,260
Marvel Superhero Squad the Infinity Gauntlet on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, I concur.

1154
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,260
It's terrible.

1155
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,680
It's like Mario, Marvel Superhero Babies or something like that.

1156
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:46,640
National Geographic Challenge Wildlife on Playstation 3 and Wii.

1157
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:52,920
Pac-Man Party, ugh, that's coming out on the Wii.

1158
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,040
Barbie Grooming Glam Pups on the Wii and DS.

1159
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,320
Is there a single listener of Orange Launch Radio that's going to be picking up Barbie

1160
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,680
Grooming Glam Pups?

1161
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,680
No but it is.

1162
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,840
Why do we list them on the release dates?

1163
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,480
Because they're coming out, okay?

1164
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,240
I don't care about all of these titles.

1165
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,000
Well maybe it should stay in.

1166
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,760
People go to jail over protesting cosmetic use on animals and you have a game where you

1167
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,640
have to put mascara on a dog or something.

1168
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,360
I don't even want to know what that game involves.

1169
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:28,000
You Gave Your Cat a Perm, 20 points.

1170
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,160
That's pretty much the Chocobo game on Facebook.

1171
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,440
Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii.

1172
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,080
Yes that's not confusing at all, just repeating the title because oh yeah it's going back

1173
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,320
to its roots I guess.

1174
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,880
Will that work as well as it did on Kariok Revolution, the game that everybody forgot

1175
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,760
was even out there that you said you were going to support with download content but

1176
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,760
never did?

1177
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,400
Yeah, I thought so.

1178
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,120
Namco Museum Megamix.

1179
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,040
It's more Namco arcade games for the Wii.

1180
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,120
Split second on PSP this week.

1181
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,200
Apache Air Assault on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

1182
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:11,680
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and I believe PC as well.

1183
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,240
We'll skip past all this crap since you don't want to talk about iCarly 2.

1184
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,200
iCarly, I believe it's I Join the Click.

1185
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,560
I think that's what it was called.

1186
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,000
I Stab Myself.

1187
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,840
And then I Told You, I don't know if I mentioned this last week, but reload target down on

1188
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,840
the Wii.

1189
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,640
It's a target shooting game.

1190
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,680
That's right, you don't actually kill real people in it.

1191
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,960
That's terrible.

1192
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,960
What's the point?

1193
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
Yes, exactly.

1194
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:48,720
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon on the Wii, Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2011, god I don't

1195
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,720
care.

1196
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:55,240
Oh yeah Dance Dance Revolution on Playstation 3 as well with the move support, oooh.

1197
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,320
EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp.

1198
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,320
That's a hundred bucks by the way.

1199
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,040
That's coming out on the Wii.

1200
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,720
Hello Kitty Seasons on the Wii.

1201
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,040
What does that come with to justify the hundred dollar price?

1202
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,880
Does it come with one of those full training dummies that you slam into to try and tackle

1203
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,880
for your living room?

1204
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,600
No, they actually do have, it's a set of wireless sensors, they've got a pedometer, some sort

1205
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,480
of thing built in, it's a bunch of sensors and what not, heart rate monitors.

1206
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,920
For your ass.

1207
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,760
For your ass, yes that's right, cause your ass has its own heart.

1208
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:36,080
Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, that's on the Nintendo DS this week, why'd you even

1209
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,080
ask?

1210
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:45,240
Harry, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Spartan 1, that's coming out on PS3, Xbox

1211
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:53,800
360, Wii, DS, PC, and I believe the Xbox 360 version, you can cast spells with the Kinect,

1212
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,800
oooh.

1213
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:00,040
Wii Sports Active 2.0, that's also a hundred bucks each, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii,

1214
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:04,400
and on top of all that, you need the Move, or Kinect, well then the Wii, you just need

1215
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
the Wii stuff.

1216
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,240
That's expensive all around.

1217
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,280
Other fun stuff this week, and there is some fun stuff, and this is pretty awesome, Need

1218
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:22,080
for Speed Hot Pursuit, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and this is from

1219
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:27,640
Criterion, I mean the guy's behind the Burnout series, so you know it's gonna be good.

1220
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:36,320
Sonic Colors on the Wii and Nintendo DS, and then there's this game called Create, which

1221
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:41,520
is from EA, it's, they're trying to make it like some sort of little big planet thing,

1222
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,640
but really it's not.

1223
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:54,000
That's on PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and, and finally rounding things

1224
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:01,560
out here, Zumba Fitness, it's some Latin dance exercise thing, I keep seeing infomercials

1225
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:07,320
for early in the morning, because I have to get up with the baby, Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation

1226
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,840
3, and of course those do support the Move and Kinect.

1227
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:15,400
Deck of Sports Freedom, that is a Kinect game that's based off that Wii game that they put

1228
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,440
out, and then finally, I'm told those Deck of Sports games do really well.

1229
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,840
They do actually, and they're not too terrible, remember we played Deck of Sports 1, yeah

1230
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:30,280
because it had curling, which made it the best, figure skating, made it the best, oh

1231
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,680
I hope they have figure skating on the Kinect, that would be tons of fun to do in that living

1232
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,680
room.

1233
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,040
I don't think they have figure skating, but they have some other stuff.

1234
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,720
I could be my own Brian Boitano.

1235
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,220
And then Pro Evolution Soccer 2011.

1236
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,220
And that's it.

1237
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,120
That was on the Wii, of course.

1238
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:49,220
Looking in our chatroom at chat.orangessontrady.com, Frisbee says, speaking of worthless, what

1239
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,880
ever happened to the Vitality sensor?

1240
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,000
Good question.

1241
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Never came out.

1242
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Okay.

1243
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,480
Maybe that'll be the big thing in X-T3.

1244
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:02,040
Well if you remember though, Ubisoft does have their own version of that that's on PC

1245
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:06,120
though, remember that, I don't remember the hell it was called, but it was just like,

1246
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,720
okay, breathe in and out.

1247
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,720
Breathe in and out of the game.

1248
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,720
No, we relax, right?

1249
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,720
Or whatever.

1250
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,720
I don't know.

1251
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,720
It wasn't real.

1252
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,720
Breathe the game.

1253
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,720
I like to breathe.

1254
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,560
Alright, let's go to our Japanese release dates, hooray.

1255
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:25,640
Call of Duty Black Ops gets a subtitle edition released in Japan this week on November 18th.

1256
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:31,840
EA Sports MMA, The Sims 3, Crossboard 7, and Dance Evolution all as well come out this

1257
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,080
week on the Xbox 360.

1258
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,640
In fact, I think this is the big week for Kinect in Japan.

1259
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,040
November 20th is their launch day over there, so it's about what, six days away?

1260
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,240
20 is an important number.

1261
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
Is it?

1262
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Yes it is.

1263
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
Oh, 20 November, get it?

1264
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,200
They're getting Dance Evolution on 20 November.

1265
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,200
Tell me that's not a coincidence.

1266
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,680
Alright, so yeah, those are all those releases.

1267
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,160
So some of the Kinect games, I guess I should read some of these other Kinect games that

1268
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,160
are coming out in Japan.

1269
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,160
What are they getting?

1270
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,640
Crossboard 7, Karada D- What's Crossboard 7?

1271
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,920
Well now I gotta look, it's from Konami.

1272
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,120
It is a Kinect game.

1273
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,820
Oh, Adrenaline Misfits.

1274
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:10,820
Is that what that is?

1275
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,820
That's what it is over here.

1276
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:21,200
Okay, then there's Karada de Kitaro Ashitari no Torre, which is, looks like a game that

1277
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,640
uses like, it's like a brain training type of game but with Kinect.

1278
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:29,440
Uh, Dr. Kiyosawa's brain and body training is what it's gonna be coming out over here.

1279
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,920
Wow, look at you.

1280
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:36,080
Sonic Sports, Sonic Free Riders, and that's all I'm seeing for their releases out the

1281
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,080
gate.

1282
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,240
So I don't know if it's just not as huge of a launch over there or what.

1283
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,800
And that brain training game is, it's by the guy that did Brain Age.

1284
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,000
Very interesting that there's no localized Dance Central, so the only dance game they're

1285
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,160
gonna have is Dance Masters.

1286
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,160
Interesting.

1287
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:57,860
Uh, Playstation 3, Agreste Senke 2 comes out in regular and limited edition.

1288
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,100
Why are you laughing over there?

1289
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,880
It's Record of the Agreste Wars, remember the bringing game?

1290
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,240
Oh, yes.

1291
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,840
Oh my gosh.

1292
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:12,440
You play an amnesiac murderer, you have killed a god, to revive him you must travel the land

1293
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,880
with three heroines and choose one of them to soul pleat.

1294
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,160
Yeah, soul pleat.

1295
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:23,240
I know, I know what they mean by that.

1296
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,000
Call of Duty Black Ops has a subtitle edition there as well.

1297
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,960
A candy pink version of the DualShock 3, hooray.

1298
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:35,680
Gekyatsu, Pachi Game Tamashi, Evangelion, Hajimari no Fukuin comes out this week.

1299
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,000
More Evangelion, is it based on the new series?

1300
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I don't know.

1301
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,920
It looks like a card game and it has clips from the anime in it.

1302
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,720
Oh, is it a pachinko game or a card game?

1303
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,720
I think it's pachinko.

1304
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,420
Oh yeah, that looks like a pachinko game.

1305
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,640
That part does, but I don't know, there might be more to it.

1306
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,680
It might be a party game or something.

1307
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,640
Move to Party comes out as well.

1308
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:01,320
That's just what, the move, PlayStation move, party game, but it's cute.

1309
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:05,360
Nikudan comes out this week as well from Sony in Japan.

1310
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:09,400
I don't know what game this is, but it's like a fighting game that uses the move.

1311
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,400
What is this?

1312
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,260
That's the fight the lights out.

1313
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,640
Is this out here already?

1314
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,720
Yeah, it's terrible.

1315
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,760
Looks very hardcore.

1316
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,320
Sims 3 also comes out this week on PlayStation 3 in Japan as well.

1317
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,400
This is a big week for releases in Japan.

1318
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,800
Nintendo Wii gets Sonic Colors this week.

1319
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,680
I'm sorry, that's a US release that a lot of people in Japan are bringing over.

1320
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,280
Oh no, it is out as well on the 18th.

1321
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,440
It's on there twice.

1322
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,720
Tatyate Hasumu Smash Ball Plus with a pink Wii Remote Plus.

1323
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,720
That comes out.

1324
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,080
That's the game that was circulating earlier is coming with the, it's Fling Smash.

1325
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,200
Yeah, that's what it is.

1326
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:54,060
Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin, and this comes with a power-up kit.

1327
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:58,040
That's a price reduction of a game that was already out.

1328
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:03,160
And then World Soccer Winning 11 2011 comes out on the Wii this week as well.

1329
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:08,000
Going to the handhelds real quick, on the Nintendo DS, there is the Pokemon Black and

1330
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,200
White DSIs are coming out very soon.

1331
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:16,920
Otherwise Sonic Colors is coming out as well as a game called Motostitich Rhythm de Rakugaki

1332
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,840
Daisakusen comes out from Disney this week, so it must be some type of Disney rhythm game.

1333
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,600
I'm trying to load more information on that right now.

1334
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,200
Oh, it is Stitch.

1335
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,240
Why did they put an extra T in his name?

1336
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,840
They have that camo I wrote over here around March.

1337
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,480
It was a Stitch music game.

1338
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,400
So the Stitch music game is coming out in Japan this week.

1339
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,800
I forgot what it was called though.

1340
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,920
Yeah, it probably isn't that notable.

1341
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,480
And then on the Sony PSP this week, a brand new PSP bundle in Black and Red and White

1342
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:49,600
and Blue, those all come out this week, as well as Criminal Girls is the game that comes

1343
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,440
out this week.

1344
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,440
I'll leave that to your imagination.

1345
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:57,920
It's an RPG and it has chicks in prisoner outfits with big boobies and cop outfits in

1346
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:05,040
big boobies and yep, lots of big boobies in that chibi anime style for your PSP.

1347
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,000
Criminal Girls, because they've been very bad and they need to be punished.

1348
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,440
Just like Dark Sakura in the UK releases.

1349
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,040
I don't need to be punished.

1350
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,000
I'm a good girl.

1351
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,720
Now I've got to find them again.

1352
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,720
Okay.

1353
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,720
On the 19th, the whole bunch of stuff.

1354
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:26,720
We have Apache Air Assault, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Blood Drive, Create, EA Sports

1355
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:32,880
Active 2.0, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, Harvest Moon Animal Parade, Harvest

1356
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:39,000
Moon Sunshine, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, and Prince of Persia Trilogy and Split Second

1357
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,600
Velocity, and the Piece of Crap Superhero Squad.

1358
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,000
I love Marvel, but damn.

1359
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,780
Oh, and on the 21st, Super Crate Box.

1360
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:49,780
Super Crate Box?

1361
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,200
I'm going to see what this is.

1362
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
Or Crepe Box.

1363
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,200
Crepe.

1364
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,880
Because I was like, mm, crepe sounds really good right now.

1365
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,760
I don't know about you guys, but crepe.

1366
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,160
It doesn't have anything for it.

1367
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,160
Oh, Crepe Box?

1368
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
It's a Super Crepe Box.

1369
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,640
Like, isn't that redundant?

1370
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,640
Crepe Box?

1371
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,120
Well, it's a box that you store crates in.

1372
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,720
It makes sense.

1373
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,400
That makes as much sense as Forklift.

1374
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,680
They're talking about that Criminal Girls game in our chat room and Breakman is like,

1375
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,680
Criminal Girls?

1376
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,240
This is a girls' prison game, and Frisbee chimes in with, OK, girls, shower time.

1377
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,240
You guys all need to get laid, seriously.

1378
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,240
Alright.

1379
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,920
Nothing wrong with that.

1380
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,120
They're just trying to be cleanly.

1381
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:35,600
So, uh, how about that Microsoft?

1382
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,640
How about it?

1383
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,640
How about them?

1384
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,120
Um, they are suing Motorola.

1385
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:46,560
No, not because some bad phone deal, but apparently they licensed some technology from Motorola

1386
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,160
and Motorola decided, hey, you know what?

1387
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,800
We want more money.

1388
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:56,360
And they've been charging royalties that are excessive and discriminatory, according to

1389
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,520
Microsoft.

1390
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:05,960
And apparently, I guess this is regarding its video decoding and wireless LAN technology.

1391
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:10,680
I guess that's incorporated into the Xbox 360.

1392
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,680
And apparently they are going to court over it to see whether or not Microsoft has to

1393
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:23,760
pay those excessive royalties that Motorola thinks are deserved.

1394
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,520
Hmm.

1395
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,600
Yay, lawsuits.

1396
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,960
There's always some lawsuit.

1397
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,560
Somebody suing somebody over something.

1398
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,200
Oh, yeah.

1399
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:39,920
Will this change gaming as we know it, or is this just kind of a cock-waving competition?

1400
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,760
It just, I don't think it's going to change anything.

1401
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,880
It's just about rights and stuff.

1402
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,680
It just means that they make less money.

1403
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:52,280
You know, maybe if you were investing in Microsoft or Motorola, that might matter to you, but

1404
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,680
probably not.

1405
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:59,320
And if Microsoft loses the case, they'll just pass the expense onto the consumers.

1406
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,040
And then the sun will continue to rise tomorrow.

1407
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,040
Exactly.

1408
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,040
Nice.

1409
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:08,920
By the way, just, I don't mean to backtrack, but sometimes the chat room is a little lagged,

1410
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:13,640
but I'm getting some tells about the Stitch game that we were talking about before.

1411
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,640
Apparently it's getting a...

1412
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,640
Stitch Jam is what it was called.

1413
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,640
Stitch Jam.

1414
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,280
But the Japanese version of Stitch Jam.

1415
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,560
Apparently they're liking it over there.

1416
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,240
Famitsu's given it a silver rating.

1417
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:25,240
So just because they're based off of movies does not necessarily mean they're...

1418
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,240
Anything that Famitsu doesn't totally fart on has to be somewhat decent.

1419
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,240
Well, yeah.

1420
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,600
I mean, Famitsu's harsh, at least they used to be.

1421
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,080
Well, if you want it now, I'm sure it's dirt cheap because it's been out since March and

1422
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,320
it wasn't that hot of a seller.

1423
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,920
In fact, it wasn't really much of a seller at all.

1424
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,520
I wonder if it's gonna do better over there than it did here.

1425
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
Interesting.

1426
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,880
Stitch is super, super popular.

1427
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,880
That makes sense, actually.

1428
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,420
Like, you can get, like, total, um, the UFO catchers, like, are just totally Stitch loaded

1429
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,420
in some places.

1430
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,420
Hmm.

1431
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,420
So...

1432
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,420
Stitch is adorable, though.

1433
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:58,420
Stitch is great.

1434
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,420
Alright.

1435
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:05,400
I saw a Stitch costume online in one of those costume contest things online.

1436
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,960
I don't want to get into all the details, but it was a cute costume.

1437
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,960
Good times.

1438
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,960
That's cute.

1439
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,960
Mm-hmm.

1440
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,960
Hey!

1441
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,480
Let's talk about Instant Action.

1442
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,560
They've now ceased to be.

1443
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,560
That's too bad.

1444
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,560
Instant...

1445
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,040
I remember seeing these guys at PAX one year.

1446
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,680
I think they were at PAX East earlier this year.

1447
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,680
I don't know.

1448
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,680
But, yeah.

1449
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,720
These guys were famous because they were developing this technology where you could play Monkey

1450
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:32,760
Island in your browser window, and Instant Jam, I think, had a whole thing going on.

1451
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,400
Well, here's the deal.

1452
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,600
Instant Action actually informed their employees that they're going to wind down operations.

1453
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,600
They are shutting down instantaction.com.

1454
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:48,040
They are, however, going to continue torquepower.com while they look for buyers for torque.

1455
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,040
So there you go.

1456
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,960
Ah, yep.

1457
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,080
I guess there's also a comment that was made to the Kotaku website in that, quote, it was

1458
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:02,040
an operating in a highly competitive industry, and the business didn't scale profitably in

1459
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,840
the manner we had expected.

1460
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,680
Well, unfortunately, you know, some of these things just take kind of time to build, and

1461
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:12,480
it doesn't sound like they had a huge catalog of the streaming games, and, you know, I think

1462
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:16,680
in order to make a splash, you've got to kind of have that must-have game that's available

1463
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:20,800
through your technology, and unfortunately, Monkey Island, as good of a game as it was,

1464
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,960
just wasn't it, because it had already been out for a little while, and I think most people

1465
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,520
that wanted to play it probably already did, so bummer.

1466
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,480
Hopefully those guys, though, are able to land on their feet again in new positions

1467
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,880
somewhere very soon, or maybe that whole torque-powered thing will work out.

1468
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,880
Who knows?

1469
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:40,800
Anyhow, it's now time for the part of our show where we will take a trip down memory

1470
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:48,800
lane, and ask Dark Soccer to climb into the vault, but not too quickly, because we don't

1471
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,720
want to get trapped in there.

1472
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:56,360
And pick a classic game that she says, hey, listen kids, you should be playing this game

1473
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,360
right now.

1474
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,520
Get up off your couch and shake your butt.

1475
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,720
And I gotta say, I know what the classic game of the week this week is, and it kind of pains

1476
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:08,080
me to think that, yeah, this game is like nine years old, and now qualifies as a classic

1477
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,080
game.

1478
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:17,120
Rob's text to me was, I have to read this, because this is funny, hold on, where is it?

1479
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,800
I just lolled when I said I'd put it out.

1480
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,560
Well tell us what it is already, I can't stand the suspense.

1481
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,620
Para Para Paradise!

1482
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:38,600
And I picked the long version of my favorite song from that one.

1483
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:45,600
Tell me you don't want to shake your butt to this.

1484
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:52,280
This is my favorite song.

1485
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,280
Those chicks can't count.

1486
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,480
They use different numbers in Japan.

1487
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:05,920
Okay, Para Para Paradise, which was made by Konami, and it is a Gamani game, and it's

1488
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,080
for Para Para Dancing!

1489
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:16,360
It uses a motion sensor controller that's in an octagonal platform shape, and has five

1490
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,840
directional sensors that lets you, where it is, you've got Para Para mode where you do

1491
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,240
all the set, actual routines for the songs, and freestyle mode where you can dance around

1492
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:33,240
however you want to as long as you hit them, or like Iguana Girl does, goth dance.

1493
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,120
I've seen all sorts of creative interpretations to the dancing in this game, it's pretty awesome.

1494
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,160
I've seen people just use their pelvis, actually, to activate the arrows.

1495
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,160
Yes, it is.

1496
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,960
I've seen people do it with just their legs.

1497
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,360
Pretending they have a, you know, pretending they have their penis out, or in some cases

1498
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,360
in the privacy of their own home, not pretending.

1499
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,640
If you've got the pink biscuits, then you do.

1500
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,560
Well there were different versions, there was of course the first mix, and then there

1501
01:12:53,560 --> 01:13:00,600
was a second mix that had the actual models dancing along with you mirrored so that you

1502
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:08,640
could see them, and it even had a learn the Para mode, learn the dance mode, which, that's

1503
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,640
how I learned a few of them was playing that.

1504
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,080
I think Stockton Golf Land still has theirs.

1505
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,600
I need to get back there.

1506
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,480
Yeah, it was super fun.

1507
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:24,040
It had, for the US, oh not the US, I'm just saying we never got it over here, for the

1508
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:32,080
home version, it had actual dancers that you could play in mirrored mode, or it had it

1509
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,520
in the corner, you could watch Learn It Too.

1510
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,400
Which is what Dance Masters is now.

1511
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:45,080
Yeah, well Dance Masters is, it defaults mirrored, so that's pretty cool.

1512
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:51,520
It basically, it was really neat, I thought, because it was something, now, I'll tell you

1513
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:59,160
what, I had actually just heard about Para Para dancing right about the same time the

1514
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,840
game came out, and then I saw pictures of people playing, I was like, they're doing

1515
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,680
those little dances!

1516
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,040
The first time we ever met was over at Para Para Para Ice Machine, wasn't it?

1517
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:15,500
And that was, I learned like half of Eurobeat, that particular song.

1518
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:20,400
Your song's over, so I'm gonna play one of mine, it's in Dance Masters actually.

1519
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,400
Like a Virgin?

1520
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,400
I don't know.

1521
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,400
Where, oh.

1522
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,680
These are all people playing the stupid game, no I do love that song though, let me see

1523
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,680
if I can find that.

1524
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,680
It's by Virginelle, I think.

1525
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,680
God, how do I know this?

1526
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,540
Well, and also one of our listeners has been kind of hooking me up with lots and lots and

1527
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:40,240
lots of super Eurobeat CDs and dance manias and stuff.

1528
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,920
I've been quite the pleased little fangirl.

1529
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:51,600
But yeah, and the other thing with the whole Para Para genre is that it really came up

1530
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:56,600
with the whole Gyaru sub, oh you found it?

1531
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Was I right?

1532
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,600
Huh.

1533
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:04,760
Sorry, I just wanted the bones in there.

1534
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,480
It was really attached very strongly to the Gyaru subculture too, which is actually still

1535
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:16,760
going on, 10 plus years strong, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they all Para Para and

1536
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,760
go to clubs.

1537
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:25,800
Velfar, the song that, the first song, got Rob sitting in his chair doing the damn dance.

1538
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:31,240
But the club- I can't believe I remember this, I feel so gay right now.

1539
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:37,560
But the big Para Para club, Velfar, that that song was made for, they, since it's gone out

1540
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,760
of business I think it's gone down, or it's turned into a different place.

1541
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:45,400
But yeah, I mean there were all kinds of Avex tracks, songs like Velfar 2000, Anniversary,

1542
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:52,320
Boom Boom Fire, some of the J-Euro tracks, which my favorite was Deluxe because that

1543
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,800
was the one where you shook your butt, really, a lot.

1544
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,520
Rob's back to doing the dance again.

1545
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,520
There was a Korean version that came out.

1546
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,840
Now Para Para Paradise only came out at the Jabbalies Market, but there were the three

1547
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,960
arcade versions because there was a 1.5 and then the second J-Mix.

1548
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:18,640
But there was a Korean version called Para Para Dancing that was pretty much mostly Korean

1549
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:27,240
music, like it had BoA and SES and it had a version of Hold On Me done in Korean.

1550
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:35,360
And it said that you could, I guess, play front to back and it had some in the back

1551
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:41,800
so you could face, instead of facing the machine, you could face the crowd so you could dance

1552
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:47,640
to them.

1553
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:52,680
And by the way, Rob was looking at the video that I have been watching to relearn the dances.

1554
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:57,120
This is not a play through, it's a little piggy crying wee wee wee.

1555
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,120
Stupid advertisements.

1556
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,120
I'll talk over it.

1557
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,120
Alright.

1558
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,520
Then there was an open source one.

1559
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:09,440
The StepMania had support for Para Para Paradise and then there's one called Parastar that's

1560
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:16,680
a StepMania 4.0 modification you can get at Club Parastar if you just look up their website.

1561
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:22,240
Then they're actually, the main developers are trying to crack it.

1562
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,760
They've gotten pretty far with it.

1563
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,280
They've gotten through the test menu but they can't operate it since they can't find the

1564
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,280
input ports.

1565
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,280
And there you have it, Rob.

1566
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,880
You wanna turn this one up?

1567
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,720
I can't, it's not playing.

1568
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,720
There we go.

1569
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,240
Here we go.

1570
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,240
This is in Dance Masters.

1571
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,240
Did you mention the Dreamcast one?

1572
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,240
Yes, it was the Dreamcast one too.

1573
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:45,680
I believe it's not mentioned here, but yeah, you had the Dreamcast one, didn't you?

1574
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,680
Is Dream Para, yeah.

1575
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,680
Dream Para.

1576
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,400
They had the, what, blue biscuits or purple?

1577
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,400
They're purple.

1578
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,400
Yeah.

1579
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,400
Or no, green.

1580
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,400
Green biscuits.

1581
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,400
Green biscuits.

1582
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,400
That was it.

1583
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:01,400
Because I think that green is the opposite of the Para pink.

1584
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,400
That hot green.

1585
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:10,400
I got it because I can get a controller adapter to hook them up to my PC so I could use it

1586
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,400
for, you know.

1587
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:16,400
I actually was just wrong because it wouldn't be a neon green, it would be a dark green.

1588
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,400
It would be the opposite of hot pink.

1589
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,400
Anyway, that's a different story.

1590
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,640
That's me going into color theory, sorry.

1591
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,120
I'm just staring at this girl, she's so adorable.

1592
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:29,160
You should watch her one for Velfar because she's absolutely even more adorable.

1593
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:32,240
She does the little happy pose.

1594
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,320
So how is it detecting what she's doing, is it like a semicircle on the floor that she's

1595
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,320
standing in?

1596
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,640
Well, she's actually just doing the dance.

1597
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,640
Okay.

1598
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,480
But in the game, it has five sensors.

1599
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,480
There's one to each side, one diagonally on each side, and then one in front of you.

1600
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:52,200
So when you do your hand waving, it'll fit.

1601
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:57,760
And it doesn't necessarily register your height of where your hands are, it just measures

1602
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,720
that they're in the right position.

1603
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,720
So.

1604
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,920
Good times.

1605
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,920
Yep.

1606
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,200
So it's Para-para-paradise.

1607
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:09,080
Your classic game of the week, Para-para-paradise.

1608
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,000
Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1609
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,760
Old favorite from back in the Bimani fandom days, although I'm still a fan of Bimani,

1610
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,760
you know, back when it was good.

1611
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:21,140
All right, anyhow, that's gonna do it for part A, but hey, we have plenty more show

1612
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,140
to come.

1613
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:23,140
Don't go anywhere.

1614
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:24,640
When we come back, we're gonna talk plenty more.

1615
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,360
We have a lot of quick, quick news tonight.

1616
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:31,000
Things about like Yars' Revenge, more Facebook games, Lame Castle, Naughty Bear 2, believe

1617
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
it or not.

1618
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,960
We're gonna talk about Black Ops a little bit.

1619
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:37,800
I know it's not usually the type of game we get into on the show, but it's broken sales

1620
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,800
records.

1621
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,520
We have to say something about it and talk a little bit about maybe a change in how to

1622
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,520
price games.

1623
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,800
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

1624
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,840
So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1625
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:55,920
We'll be back right after this.

1626
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,560
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1627
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:06,280
We are live on November the 14th of 2010 here for the 389th episode of our show.

1628
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,760
Join us in our chat room if you are listening live because we do tape live every week Sunday

1629
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,860
night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

1630
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:17,480
You can join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where some of the chatters were reacting

1631
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,360
to the music that we were playing during the break.

1632
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,360
Some loved it.

1633
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,360
Some hated it.

1634
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,160
Sadly, we can't do the music during the podcast because it is copyrighted stuff.

1635
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,840
We were playing some of the music from the Classic Game of the Week, Pa-da-pa-da-pa-da-dice,

1636
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,120
and it's all happy, bouncy stuff, and it's, you know, very interesting.

1637
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,160
I'll certainly say that.

1638
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:38,520
So anyhow, we're gonna get back into some gaming news here real quick.

1639
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,000
I guess we'll start off with Loki.

1640
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,140
Yes, some rapid fire news here.

1641
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:49,720
We've got news that, and I don't know if this is too exciting, I liked at least one of these

1642
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,720
games.

1643
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:56,480
Wet 2 and Naughty Bear 2 are confirmed in development at Behaviour.

1644
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:02,280
Wet was kind of cool, it was sort of supposed to be like a punk-rockish action game, and

1645
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,880
I thought it was alright.

1646
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,840
Naughty Bear 2, eh, wasn't all that great.

1647
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,560
Naughty Bear 2 was one of those things that, like, looked great on paper.

1648
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:13,760
Yeah, Naughty Bear, it was just kinda, eh, didn't do very well.

1649
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:19,440
Well it also just got raped by the critics, and, you know, and it's not for lack of reason,

1650
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,680
you know, it was kinda crap.

1651
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:26,440
Yeah, I'd actually like to go back and play Wet, because I think that'd be pretty cool.

1652
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:32,680
Naughty Bear 2, really don't need to work on that, it's, eh, whatever.

1653
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:36,640
This is kinda neat, I guess, if you're into the whole social gaming stuff.

1654
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:41,920
Connect Sports has an app now on Facebook, and it'll allow you to actually track your

1655
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:48,960
player's league results, and allow them to issue invitations to have others be invited,

1656
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,120
and also, I guess, video highlights from the game.

1657
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:59,400
I haven't played the game yet, so I guess it takes video of you, and, of course, videos

1658
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:04,280
won't be shown unless you go ahead and give it the okay to do so.

1659
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:10,880
But yeah, that is available now on Facebook, so if you wanna check it out, go to apps.facebook.com

1660
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,880
slash Connect Sports.

1661
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,880
Do you own Connect Sports?

1662
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:13,880
I do.

1663
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:14,880
What do you think?

1664
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:15,880
Haven't played it.

1665
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,880
Like, I just said, haven't played it yet.

1666
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,880
I'm sorry.

1667
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,880
I was trying to-

1668
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:21,600
I don't have a lot of time, and, you know, honestly, when it's like, well, I could try

1669
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:26,080
Connect Sports, or I could play Dance Central.

1670
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,720
I saw, like, five seconds of it in a store, an electronics store, where they had it on

1671
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,280
demo and the bowling game was up, and it looked cute.

1672
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:39,960
You know, that reminds me, since I went to Burger King before I came over here, which,

1673
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:46,920
by the way, I had three of the buck doubles, I stacked them onto a six-pattie burger and

1674
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:52,600
proceeded to eat that, which is slightly better for me than eating the three burgers because

1675
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,960
I didn't eat all the buns to go along with it.

1676
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:55,960
I saved-

1677
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:56,960
Slightly better.

1678
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:57,960
That's the set.

1679
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,200
That's eating three-quarters of the carton of ice cream instead of the whole carton.

1680
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,200
It was good for you.

1681
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,200
All right.

1682
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,700
But anyways, I just thought I'd mention for the Sacramento area listeners, actually, it's

1683
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:11,760
funny enough, this week, the Connect Tour that Microsoft is doing is actually coming

1684
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:19,160
to the Burger King that I went to to get my food, which would be on 7760 Sunrise Boulevard

1685
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,160
Citrus Heights.

1686
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:24,880
They're going to be there November 17th and 18th from 1030 to 730 p.m.

1687
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,920
So if you want to go check out some of the stuff and maybe get some swag, yeah, it's

1688
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:36,120
like literally up the street from here, so, you know, you can go ahead and do that there.

1689
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:40,060
So I just thought I'd mention that or Xbox.com such Burger King if you want to know those

1690
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,560
dates later on.

1691
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,560
But yeah, that's later this week.

1692
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,960
It's kind of cool.

1693
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,960
Yeah.

1694
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:49,740
So if you're interested, like I said, if you're into social gaming, honestly, I would never

1695
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:53,360
use this because I hate when people do that kind of stuff.

1696
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:58,360
And maybe I'm just not the right person for that kind of thing.

1697
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,280
Finally, this is kind of cool.

1698
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:07,760
Apparently there is the PSP commercial where they were dissing, I guess, gaming on phones

1699
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,600
and whatnot, and they had a game called Lame Castle that was in this PSP commercial.

1700
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:18,160
Well, funny enough, someone apparently decided, hey, you know what, we're going to make Lame

1701
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,240
Castle.

1702
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:28,040
So apparently it is actually in development by a team called B-Rad Entertainment and they

1703
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:34,880
have released Lame Castle on Android and there's an iPhone version also apparently in the works.

1704
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,840
So that's kind of funny.

1705
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,840
Lame Castle.

1706
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,840
Lame Castle.

1707
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:39,840
Well, they're getting free advertising.

1708
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,840
I mean, why not?

1709
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:41,840
Yeah.

1710
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,840
All right.

1711
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,720
Some other news going on in the gaming world real quick here.

1712
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:50,520
A little bit of a WoW story, but this is big enough to report on here.

1713
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,520
There's now a dial-in battle.net authenticator.

1714
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,920
You know how WoW accounts are very prone to getting hacked sometimes by shady people?

1715
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,200
Well, authenticators have been something that Blizzard's really been pushing and if you

1716
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:06,560
have an iPhone or a Droid or really any mobile phone capable of running apps, you can get

1717
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,560
a free authenticator.

1718
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,600
I wasn't even serious about the game and I had an authenticator.

1719
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Yeah.

1720
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,040
I mean, and anybody that's going to play the game that really values their stuff really

1721
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,260
ought to get one.

1722
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:19,320
It's sad that it's come to this, but it's really not Blizzard's fault.

1723
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,340
I mean, people are trying to hack this game left and right.

1724
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:28,000
So one thing that Blizzard is putting out there is that they now have a dial-in authenticator.

1725
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,400
It's basically a phone number that you can call.

1726
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:35,880
It's an 800 number and any time that the game detects suspicious activity, the game will

1727
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,480
call you and give you a password to put in.

1728
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,560
You basically like give it a phone number.

1729
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,560
You call this number.

1730
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:45,120
I haven't used it myself, but it's kind of interesting.

1731
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,800
It's a standby telephone-based way of verifying you.

1732
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,720
Again, you only have to use it when it detects suspicious activity.

1733
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:57,800
Then I guess, you know, basically that the logins are coming from a foreign country.

1734
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:03,080
So kind of interesting that they've put that as a solution as well.

1735
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,480
You know, Atari's been updating some of their old classics lately.

1736
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,080
Haunted House was just released on the Xbox as a fourth.

1737
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,080
Never played it.

1738
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,080
And did anyone care?

1739
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,080
I don't know.

1740
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,320
More people might care about this one though, because this was one of the best Atari 2600

1741
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,320
games that was out there.

1742
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:18,200
Yars Revenge apparently is coming out.

1743
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,880
It's supposed to be quarter one of 2011 coming out on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live

1744
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,440
Arcade, and of course the PC.

1745
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:28,920
That is from a financial results briefing that Atari had earlier this week.

1746
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,840
Yars Revenge is on its way.

1747
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,600
Also, by the way, Asteroids, Star Raiders, and Centipede are all supposed to be getting

1748
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,920
remakes within the next year.

1749
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,680
Those are already previously announced.

1750
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,480
Didn't they do that stuff?

1751
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:45,200
I know they've done Asteroid remakes and they haven't been that good.

1752
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,960
Some of the remakes are really hit and miss.

1753
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,880
I think back though, remember when they redid Pong on the PlayStation 1?

1754
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,480
That was actually kind of a cool game.

1755
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,720
At least back in the PS1 game.

1756
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,400
And I guess Tempest 2000 or whatever was supposed to be.

1757
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,280
As far as recent remakes though, I don't know.

1758
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,840
I didn't play the Haunted House one, but I have zero interest in it.

1759
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,520
But if the Yars Revenge one's any good, I'll check it out.

1760
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,520
Why not?

1761
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:10,280
Anyhow, one other news story for you guys.

1762
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:15,760
This is about a game that has come out of RPG Maker 2003.

1763
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,560
It's called Marvel Brothel.

1764
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:22,600
Yes, it is a sex RPG.

1765
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:27,480
It's basically a 16-bit style game because it was done in RPG Maker.

1766
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:31,160
And yeah, if you're a fan of Marvel, I don't know how you're going to feel about this.

1767
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:38,160
But hey, at least there's appearances from Mojo, and Forge, and Kingpin, and yeah.

1768
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:42,920
The best comment about that is one that was made by Toad from a particular screen capture

1769
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,480
that I saw.

1770
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,880
Magneto says to stop it.

1771
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,400
This is a retarded and stupid idea.

1772
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:54,760
Do you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad?

1773
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:59,320
Same thing that happens when you let Joss Whedon write a screenplay.

1774
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,200
Hey.

1775
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,480
You can address those emails to Salacious Pop.

1776
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,800
Actually he doesn't have an email in the Orange Lounge.

1777
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,520
Maybe we need to get him one for all the hate mail he's going to generate there.

1778
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,520
Alright.

1779
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,720
Anyhow, let's move on, Dark Sakura.

1780
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:20,280
Well, in other news, for those of us who are mobile phone gamers, Splatterhouse is coming

1781
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,280
out.

1782
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,240
Splatterhouse is cool.

1783
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:30,040
Namco is going to be doing a release of Splatterhouse on November 23rd.

1784
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:33,180
And yeah, Splatterhouse.

1785
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:40,000
We also have Angry Birds, which is a game that I just heard of and downloaded yesterday.

1786
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,280
Because my husband's aunt is addicted to it.

1787
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,040
It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and WiiWare.

1788
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,880
And there's going to be a sequel.

1789
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:55,560
And basically this game, you slingshot different varieties of birds into castles and buildings

1790
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,560
and other things.

1791
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,320
And different birds have different powers.

1792
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,240
You have bomb birds and you have birds that drop eggs.

1793
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,820
Or maybe poop.

1794
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:09,680
It's really the most popular iPhone game right now and I'm not as into it, but I don't hate

1795
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,680
it.

1796
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,680
I mean, whatever.

1797
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,680
If that's what people want to play.

1798
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,040
It's better than fart apps.

1799
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:19,000
Someone on the Bart train that I rode up here was playing Three Angry Birds right next to

1800
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
me.

1801
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,760
And I just wanted to smack it out of his hand.

1802
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,760
Why is that?

1803
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:23,760
Why all the hate?

1804
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:29,560
I played it on the iPad when you got your iPhone 4 and I got to like the third level

1805
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,020
and I don't get it.

1806
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:32,020
It's kind of stupid.

1807
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,020
I didn't like it.

1808
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,080
Well now you can play it on Xbox Live Arcade or not.

1809
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,080
Or you can make fun of it there.

1810
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,080
Yes.

1811
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,080
There you go.

1812
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,120
But you won't be using your fingers to do it.

1813
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,120
No.

1814
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,120
No.

1815
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,120
No.

1816
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,840
Anything else, DarkSakura, before we get to Twitter topics?

1817
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:45,840
Yes.

1818
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,240
Rock band releases.

1819
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,240
Ooh.

1820
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,240
Um.

1821
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:53,160
The, the, the, the Bee Gees.

1822
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,160
The Bee Gees are awesome.

1823
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,160
Yeah.

1824
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,160
Look at that hair.

1825
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:03,640
Actually, that particular image is the same image that was used on the back cover of the

1826
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,000
Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.

1827
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,040
And you know how I know this.

1828
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,280
I had two versions of it on vinyl.

1829
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,920
A double LP.

1830
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:12,760
The guy in the middle looks kind of like Jesus.

1831
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,760
Like, you can't deny that.

1832
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:14,760
I'm going to post this in the chatroom.

1833
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,760
He's Disco Jesus.

1834
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:16,760
Yeah, he's Disco Jesus.

1835
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:17,760
Uh.

1836
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:24,000
But you know, I actually do like the Bee Gees.

1837
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:32,560
But anyway, there's going to be A Wider Shade of Pale by Procol Harum and The Thrill is

1838
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,560
Gone by B.B.

1839
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,560
King.

1840
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,560
That's always cool.

1841
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,960
The Bee Gees pack is going to have Jive Talkin, Night Fever, Stand Alive, Nights on Broadway,

1842
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,080
Tragedy, and You Should Be Dancing.

1843
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:46,680
The first three and the last one were all on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.

1844
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:50,640
You Should Be Dancing, yeah.

1845
01:30:50,640 --> 01:31:00,200
Tragedy is the name of a heavy metal Bee Gees cover band because I've played some of them

1846
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,920
on the show before.

1847
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,040
Wow.

1848
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:13,640
And there's also a couple of them, which is Stand Alive and The Thrill is Gone have pro

1849
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:17,280
guitar bass expansions for 80 Microsoft points.

1850
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:21,280
You gotta have the Stand Alive with the pro expansions.

1851
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,280
Awesome.

1852
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:27,520
And I remember this picture very vividly because, like I said, I grew up with both copies of

1853
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,500
this album and played them until they skipped.

1854
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,000
You know I've never seen Saturday Night Fever?

1855
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Isn't that weird?

1856
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Am I weird?

1857
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,480
This is the beginning of it really, just watching John Travolta all young and strutting down

1858
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:38,640
the street with those shoes.

1859
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:43,160
I hear it's actually kind of a shit movie, but yet it was insanely popular.

1860
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:48,420
The sequel is something else, Directed by Sylvester Stallone.

1861
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:52,120
It actually has some showgirls aspects to it because there are these big musical numbers

1862
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:55,160
where everyone's half naked and it's like, what am I watching?

1863
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,160
What is this?

1864
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:01,360
Headbands and short shorts, which leads up to Xanadu, which is headbands and leg warmers

1865
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,680
and roller skates.

1866
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,440
Shall we move on to Twitter topics?

1867
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:12,240
I think we shall fire up the tweeter and look at some tweeter topics as we get into, oh,

1868
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,480
where's my Twitter topic music?

1869
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,480
It disappeared.

1870
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:15,480
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

1871
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:16,480
Who ate it?

1872
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,480
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

1873
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:20,160
I deleted it when you were in the can.

1874
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,160
Clearly.

1875
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,160
Somebody deleted it.

1876
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:27,400
Who's hatin' on Santa Morete?

1877
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:31,520
I guess Star Sackers is going to have to see it.

1878
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,240
Didn't this happen last week with Twitter music?

1879
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,240
Oh, there it is.

1880
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,240
There it is.

1881
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,240
We're saved.

1882
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:40,760
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

1883
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:47,080
Going on to our Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. Let's get into a tweet here from Potculture

1884
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,480
is going to start us off tonight.

1885
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:53,720
Don't know if you guys discussed it before, but I just found an Android and iOS mobile

1886
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,360
MMO game called Pocket Legends.

1887
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,480
The game is free, does have microtransactions.

1888
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,400
Pretty fun and well worth checking out.

1889
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,840
Cross platform 2, supposedly.

1890
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,360
Actually I have played this game because I also noticed it was free.

1891
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,720
It doesn't support Game Center or any of that stuff, but who cares?

1892
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,360
Game Center was kind of a flop, as was Ping.

1893
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:17,320
But anyhow, for a free game, it's very robust because it runs on like 3D graphics and it

1894
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,800
is MMO-y.

1895
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,480
Definitely a lot of Warcraft inspired things.

1896
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,520
Not something I'd play long term, but for a free diversion when you're sitting on the

1897
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,520
toilet.

1898
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,520
Good times.

1899
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,200
You totally reminded me of the shirt I want to get.

1900
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,200
What's that?

1901
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,040
It says iPhone changed the way I use the bathroom.

1902
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,040
There you go.

1903
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,200
Moving on to actdeft sends us a tweet.

1904
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:44,080
Sly 4 is being teased in the Sly collection for the PS3.

1905
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:50,080
I guess there's actually a little teaser trailer thingy on the PS3 that is teasing a new Sly

1906
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,360
game.

1907
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,480
But I mean, if there were three others and they've all been doing well, then it's a

1908
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,480
state of collection.

1909
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,520
Is this really a surprise to anybody?

1910
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:02,120
But it's nice to have it somewhat officially confirmed.

1911
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,000
Redertainment says it's a tweet.

1912
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Boxy.

1913
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,360
Overpriced, oddly shaped box or over-fucking-priced, oddly shaped piece of shit.

1914
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,360
I've never heard...

1915
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,360
What is...

1916
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,360
Boxy?

1917
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,360
What is that?

1918
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,440
Does anyone know what that is?

1919
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,000
I think it's a streaming device.

1920
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,960
Now I gotta Google it.

1921
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,720
Boxy.

1922
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:25,280
Watch movies, TV shows, and clips from the internet on your TV.

1923
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,240
Can't you already do that with a PS3?

1924
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:28,240
Pretty much.

1925
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,240
Yep.

1926
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,240
That's...

1927
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,240
You're right.

1928
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,240
It's...

1929
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,360
You can watch things that are already on the internet.

1930
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,360
It's a whole...

1931
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,560
It's basically an answer to an Apple TV, it looks like.

1932
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,560
How much do they want for it?

1933
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,560
Let me see.

1934
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,960
Buy a Boxy.

1935
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,080
It's $199.

1936
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,080
But it has...

1937
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:44,080
Braces an Apple TV.

1938
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,080
But...

1939
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,200
Isn't an Apple TV only $99 now?

1940
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,200
Really?

1941
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:51,040
Actually, Boxy puts a little comparison right there.

1942
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:54,280
They're saying there's more than there is to iTunes.

1943
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:59,660
There's twice the HD, and Boxy plays more file formats.

1944
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:04,160
Don't the new TiVos have a lot of internet integration in it now?

1945
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,160
I think so.

1946
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,160
Like if you want Hulu Plus, you can get it on TiVo, I think.

1947
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,560
I have a way around that.

1948
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,120
I have a computer hooked up to my television.

1949
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:15,180
I would say, honestly, before you spend the money on this, I mean, I guess if you really

1950
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,440
want something like this, yay.

1951
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,320
But if you already have a Playstation or Xbox 360, look into the streaming alternatives

1952
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,440
you have on there.

1953
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:26,960
Or spend like $300 on a cheap-ass laptop.

1954
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,960
And use that.

1955
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,880
And then you can actually take the cheap-ass laptop with you.

1956
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,520
Or you can build yourself a micro for like, what, $200?

1957
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,920
I guess it depends on your budget, sir.

1958
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:40,600
Our computer that we have in the front room was Leftovers.

1959
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:46,200
And now it's our internet computer for the front room so that Dan can watch Top Gear.

1960
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:54,600
You can get a PC that can stream stuff off the internet or play stuff for under $100.

1961
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,480
Our buddy SSJ100Matt is sending us a pair of tweets here.

1962
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,680
I'll read these real quickly.

1963
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:01,240
One of them has to do with Galgun.

1964
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:05,840
I guess Galgun is having a fight with Microsoft over panties.

1965
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:10,640
Because apparently the official Galgun site is down.

1966
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:14,600
I guess Galgun was supposed to be out on January 27th.

1967
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,280
But they're having some problems with Microsoft.

1968
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:21,080
There's negotiations over the moral issues about the game.

1969
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:25,360
Microsoft is objecting to the content in the shooter.

1970
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,360
Okay.

1971
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,880
I don't think this is a game that's ever going to come out over here anyway, just because

1972
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:30,880
of what it is.

1973
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,880
So enjoy.

1974
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:37,600
Also, SSJ100Matt sends us another tweet saying, hey, I know hockey doesn't bring the girls

1975
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:42,240
to the yard, but Sony released NHL Game Center Live this week for the PS3.

1976
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:46,160
And this is this whole thing where, and I was reading about this, I gotta say, yeah,

1977
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:49,440
I don't watch every hockey game that's out there, but this sounds like the way to watch

1978
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,440
a game.

1979
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,560
This is pretty impressive from what I'm reading anyway.

1980
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:57,560
I haven't watched it and compared it to the ESPN app.

1981
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,640
You have to buy the subscription.

1982
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:03,480
Okay, but if you're like an Uber hockey fan, you have to buy sports channels sometimes

1983
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,480
too.

1984
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:05,480
I mean, this sounds kind of interesting.

1985
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,920
It's an app that's going to be in the video section of the Cross Media Bar.

1986
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:13,240
It's going to be $10 unless you're a PlayStation Plus member, then it's free.

1987
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:17,920
But apparently it's very similar to MLB TV, which also came out earlier on the PS3 this

1988
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:18,920
year.

1989
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:24,280
And if you subscribe to Game Center Live, which is $169 annually, you get all of these

1990
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,280
features.

1991
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:30,000
You stream live out of market games, select playoff broadcasts.

1992
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,060
But what's cool is that it looks like the scoreboard kind of comes up live on your TV

1993
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:36,800
and you can kind of use the controllers to switch events and stuff.

1994
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,000
Kind of looks like a neat way to watch live sporting events.

1995
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,120
I like this whole like interactive stuff.

1996
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,920
Kind of cool.

1997
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:46,040
So yeah, maybe I don't watch every sports game that's out there, but I think this kind

1998
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:48,160
of technology is neat.

1999
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:53,160
It's going to change the way we watch television forever.

2000
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,400
The SEG is sending us a tweet.

2001
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:58,120
You might remember he was here a few weeks ago and he was talking about UMLoud and he

2002
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:02,400
wanted us to mention that now they've got a Pac-Man eBay auction that's going on at

2003
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,400
UMLoud.

2004
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,480
Y'all a fan of Pac-Man?

2005
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,480
Well here's the deal.

2006
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,520
They're actually going to be auctioning off at UMLoud.

2007
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,080
Actually no, I'm sorry.

2008
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,960
It's going to be on eBay right now.

2009
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:17,500
I don't think they're, I don't know if they're actually going to do this at the event.

2010
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,920
I guess since it's going on right now, you can get this right now.

2011
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:24,520
I think they know this thing's worth a lot of money and they want to do it right now.

2012
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,160
So yeah, it's Pac-Man for the Famicom.

2013
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:33,280
So this is an old ass version of Pac-Man signed by Toro Iwatani.

2014
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,680
Cool.

2015
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,520
So, very cool.

2016
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,560
Currently going for how much?

2017
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,640
Right now it's up to $565, but it's autographed by the creator of Pac-Man.

2018
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,460
That's pretty awesome.

2019
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,640
More information available at UMLoud.org.

2020
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:48,480
That's just in a couple of weeks.

2021
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,800
I can't believe it's like right around the corner.

2022
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,520
Can you believe it?

2023
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,040
Crazy stuff.

2024
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,040
Let's see.

2025
01:38:54,040 --> 01:39:00,920
Also on the tweets, going to Dark Tetsuya.

2026
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:03,640
As if Naked Dance Central weren't enough, someone did this.

2027
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,960
I'm always most afraid to click this link here, good God.

2028
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,440
It's probably the IGN Naked story.

2029
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:11,000
No, it's the Nuts.

2030
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,720
Not safe for work, two naked girls playing Kinect.

2031
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:15,720
It's topless.

2032
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,720
Enter your date of birth.

2033
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:17,720
Oh, then I want to see this.

2034
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,720
Let's see.

2035
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:25,720
June 26, 1932.

2036
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,720
Sponsor message?

2037
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:28,920
What's this bullshit?

2038
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,120
Shut up.

2039
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,120
This thing sucks.

2040
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,760
Ah, don't buy this product.

2041
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:39,320
How dare you link us to a video that has all these stupid sponsor messages in front.

2042
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,320
Okay.

2043
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,320
Here we go.

2044
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:45,040
Oh, yes, I see movies.

2045
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:49,320
Is it sad that I recognize which song they were playing and which difficulty in Dance

2046
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,320
Central?

2047
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,320
You can tell who's fake and who's not.

2048
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,320
Actually, I think they're both fake.

2049
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,320
They're both fake.

2050
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:56,320
This makes for great radio.

2051
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,920
We're looking at two topless chicks in studio right now.

2052
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,320
They're playing Lady Gaga on Easy.

2053
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,320
Oh, God, they are, aren't they?

2054
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:06,320
Yeah.

2055
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,320
Poker face.

2056
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,320
That is sad that you recognize that.

2057
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,320
It is very sad.

2058
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,320
I think she has nice boobies.

2059
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:12,320
But they're fake.

2060
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:13,320
They don't move right.

2061
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,320
And now they're doing the freestyle portion.

2062
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,320
What do you think, Alan?

2063
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16,320
Do you like the boobies?

2064
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,320
He's refusing to comment.

2065
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:28,960
If O.L.R. and Howard Stern were to ever overlap, this is as far as it gets, except he would

2066
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,520
have them in studio doing it in front of him.

2067
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:34,400
Well, we're low budget.

2068
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:39,440
I like this link from Tigerclaw sends us this link to a story here.

2069
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:44,600
Reggie is wondering where the Metroid Other M sales went wrong.

2070
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:45,600
Here's a quote.

2071
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,440
Chew on this for a minute from Reggie Fils-Aime.

2072
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:51,480
We believe that it could be, should be a million unit title.

2073
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:54,080
We're not going to get there, not through the holiday.

2074
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:57,520
And we are doing a lot of thinking as to why, because it's a great game.

2075
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,480
The consumer reaction because of the quality has been strong.

2076
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:04,560
I think the marketing was strong, advertising was very good, the social media we did was

2077
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,560
very positive.

2078
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,960
Yeah, and the story is crap.

2079
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,600
Why is that?

2080
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:17,120
So it kind of just sounds like they just, like, I.D.K., L.O.L., like, they're like,

2081
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:18,120
it's a good game.

2082
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,800
Why is it, like, they don't get at all why it didn't, it's not.

2083
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,840
People actually care about the characterization.

2084
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:23,840
Yeah.

2085
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,280
I honestly think it more has to do with the fact that people are, like, the hardcore gamers

2086
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:29,720
are kind of over the Wii.

2087
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:33,440
Like, I get that this was a game to kind of throw a bone at the hardcore gamers, but I

2088
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,240
think it was kind of too late.

2089
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,240
They've moved on a while ago.

2090
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:40,960
I think there's a lot of people like me who have put their Wii in a box.

2091
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,240
Wii in a box.

2092
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,560
It's my Wii in a box.

2093
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,560
We're 12.

2094
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,640
Should I bring out the booby video again?

2095
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,640
All right.

2096
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:51,640
I think you got a few more messages.

2097
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:55,440
Hold on, I got another one here from, uh, another one from Tiger Claw.

2098
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:59,960
Tiger, see, you know what's funny is that Tiger Claw actually sent us, like, five tweets.

2099
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:01,240
No, wait, four.

2100
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,320
But what happened is that the other two were stories we covered a minute ago, so he was

2101
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:07,920
like, oh, I know they're not going to read those, so I'm going to send new tweets.

2102
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,520
Tiger Claw has, is working the Twitters.

2103
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,760
He has the system down.

2104
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,760
But I'll allow it.

2105
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:19,920
Uh, anyhow, uh, let's see, Tiger Claw also sends us this, oh, the Wii patent infringement

2106
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:24,320
investigation, the International Trade Commission is going to be moving forward looking this,

2107
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:28,320
that the Wii system is actually infringing on patents, uh, held by Motiva.

2108
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,120
Have you never heard of them?

2109
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:31,120
They're in Ohio.

2110
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:36,880
Well, anyhow, it's, uh, they're going to complete their investigation by March 5th, 2012.

2111
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:40,960
There will be an initial determination on the matter by November 4th, 2011.

2112
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,320
Yeah, by that time, I'm sure the new Wii will be announced.

2113
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:45,320
2012.

2114
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,320
Well, we'll see.

2115
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,320
I don't know.

2116
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:48,320
Maybe not.

2117
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,320
It'll be called the what?

2118
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:50,320
The what?

2119
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,320
The what?

2120
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:52,320
So there you go.

2121
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:56,920
Uh, and by the way, just, just for historical purposes, Nintendo did win an appeal of a

2122
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:00,960
2008 decision where they were supposed to pay 21 million dollars to Anescape over the

2123
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,800
Wavebird wireless controller.

2124
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,940
So, uh, Nintendo has a good track record on these cases.

2125
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:06,940
We'll see.

2126
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:10,800
Oh, it looks like ShermeyOLR has been tweeting us here.

2127
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,640
ShermeyOLR sent us a tweet that says Rob's feet smell funny.

2128
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:14,640
Thanks for that.

2129
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,640
I appreciate that, DarkSakura, because I know that was you.

2130
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:17,640
Tell Shermey.

2131
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:20,920
I sent it telepathically to my brain that made it up.

2132
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:21,920
Whatever.

2133
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,920
Whatever.

2134
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:25,880
She's gotta sit there and smell your feet all during the show.

2135
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:26,880
Trick or treat.

2136
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:27,880
Smell my feet.

2137
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,880
She's a very patient little girl.

2138
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:30,880
Alright.

2139
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:37,840
Um, I don't know if we are still streaming because our Winamp is frozen here on our side.

2140
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:41,280
Um, so we're gonna just ride it out and see what happens.

2141
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:45,080
Uh, we're gonna keep taping for podcasts, so let's keep moving.

2142
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:47,480
Uh, we'll get into some more gaming news.

2143
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:48,560
That's it for the Twitters tonight.

2144
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,560
Disconnected.

2145
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,640
Thank you guys.

2146
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,120
Are we disconnected right now?

2147
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,120
Okay.

2148
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:55,120
I will-

2149
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,120
The IRC just disconnected.

2150
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:57,120
Okay, I'll reconnect us, guys.

2151
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,120
Yeah, it's got kicked off too.

2152
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,120
Alright.

2153
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,120
Got it.

2154
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,120
The live radio happens.

2155
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:02,120
Let's keep moving.

2156
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:03,120
Just get into the next story.

2157
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,120
I'll restart the stream.

2158
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,120
Okay.

2159
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,560
Um, let's see.

2160
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,680
Well, this is kind of interesting.

2161
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:14,280
Well, not too surprising, but Black Ops sold a lot, I guess.

2162
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:20,680
Um, they are now calling it the largest entertainment launch in history.

2163
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:29,520
It sold 5.6 million units in the US and the UK and grossed $360 million in sales for the

2164
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,120
first 24 hours.

2165
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:41,120
And apparently you want to compare that to last year's where it was 4.7 million units

2166
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,480
during the launch for Modern Warfare 2.

2167
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,520
So quite an increase from last year.

2168
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:52,360
And of course, to go along with that, Activision is saying that Call of Duty's download content

2169
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:55,560
will be the largest digital offering ever.

2170
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:56,560
Alright.

2171
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,320
Sorry to interrupt, but thanks to the live drama going on.

2172
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:01,520
Okay, so here's what happened.

2173
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,200
Our show went down for whatever reason.

2174
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,860
We had an internet clog or whatever.

2175
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:09,360
So we all get kicked from the chat room and then we all rejoin it while our ghosts are

2176
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,360
in there.

2177
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:14,320
We ran from the chat network, but at least our feed's back up and running.

2178
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:15,560
But unfortunately we're not in chat.

2179
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,000
I'll hop in chat in an hour.

2180
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
I can get you on IRC real quick if you want to switch places.

2181
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,960
Oh, yeah, you can do the whole backdoor thing.

2182
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:22,960
So why don't you...

2183
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:23,960
I'm gonna let...

2184
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:28,040
Well, let me do the next story after Loki's done here and then I'll move into that.

2185
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,040
Oh, I'm done.

2186
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,040
Oh, sorry.

2187
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:33,400
So what do you think?

2188
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,880
Why do you think this game is doing so phenomenally well?

2189
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,040
Here, actually, this is what I wanted to chew on a little bit here is that wasn't there

2190
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,040
supposed to be this whole backlash because of the Infinity Ward stuff that happened,

2191
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:44,680
which I think everyone had agreed was kind of fucked up?

2192
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:48,080
Like, wasn't there supposed to be this huge backlash against the game that didn't really

2193
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:50,480
end up happening or what?

2194
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:57,720
Yeah, probably pretty similar to the backlash, you know, that was supposed to happen with,

2195
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:02,640
you know, what, Left 4 Dead 2, remember?

2196
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:05,680
So I don't know.

2197
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:09,120
Why do you think games like these are doing extremely well?

2198
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:17,400
What is it about this genre of video game that really attracts people, you think?

2199
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:20,960
People like their first-person shooters, and especially something that has such a strong

2200
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:26,680
online component to it, you know, that's why they're all over games like Halo Reach and

2201
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:32,680
you know, Modern Warfare 2, and of course Black Ops and whatnot, especially, you know,

2202
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:38,960
more realistic shooters, you know, that have real military weapons in them and stuff.

2203
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,280
It's just, it's the perfect storm, I guess.

2204
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:47,440
But it's funny, though, because even though it's a Treyarch game, usually it's like,

2205
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:55,040
oh, Treyarch, Call of Duty, ugh, but yet they still buy it, and lots of it.

2206
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,600
Is it just the name that's attached to it, or what's the deal?

2207
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,520
Yeah, I think franchise definitely helps, but yeah, it's just funny.

2208
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,520
Interesting.

2209
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:16,280
Um, it's GameSurge.net, sorry, we're trying to work on technical difficulties here, IRC.GameSurge.net.

2210
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:18,040
But that is the IRC network we're on.

2211
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:21,240
If you want to join us, if you don't, for whatever reason, want to connect to our website

2212
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:24,400
at chat.orangehonestrated.com.

2213
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,600
You could be uncool and not go in our chat room.

2214
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,240
I know.

2215
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:31,240
All the cool kids are there except us.

2216
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:35,200
Well, how about, how about something else in news?

2217
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,200
Sure.

2218
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:41,080
Rob, I think that this might make you roll your eyes and go, what?

2219
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,080
Okay.

2220
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:46,560
U.K. retailers are deciding that they don't like Steam.

2221
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:53,400
They actually are going to try to boycott Steam effectively.

2222
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:57,400
One of them is quoted as saying, if we have a digital service, then I don't want to start

2223
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:01,240
selling a rival in store.

2224
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:05,880
So basically they're saying that not only are you competing, you know, with your product

2225
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:10,560
in the store, but you've got rivals in there as well that could be taking your market and

2226
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,640
you can do a side by side comparison for price.

2227
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,880
Took them long enough to realize this, by the way.

2228
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:16,880
Yeah.

2229
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:20,120
Well, and you know, that's the same thing that was going on with Apple and now it's

2230
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:22,080
going to be going on with Steam.

2231
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:26,640
Although honestly, from a consumer point of view, I love Steam.

2232
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:29,120
I do too because of all the sales they always do on there.

2233
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:30,120
It's great.

2234
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:31,120
Yeah.

2235
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:34,320
And pre-orders and getting to play Join Trill.

2236
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,880
I mean, I mean, I didn't say that, did I?

2237
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:37,880
Hey, I'm back in chat.

2238
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:38,880
Hooray.

2239
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:39,880
Thank you, Alan, for hooking that up.

2240
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:40,880
Chat.orangecountry.com.

2241
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:47,280
ActDeaf says U.K. retailers equals stupid, so damn stupid.

2242
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,280
I don't know though.

2243
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:53,200
I mean, if I were a retailer and you know, I'm practically selling this program that

2244
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:57,800
is going to install a store that makes it easier to take sales away from me, I don't

2245
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:58,800
know.

2246
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,680
I think they have a right to not sell it.

2247
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:04,120
I mean, it's a tricky line to balance though.

2248
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:10,000
It's up to them, but honestly, I mean, they're going between the easy sale and market profit,

2249
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,660
whatever to the what's going to be better for them in the long term.

2250
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:16,920
And I don't even know that that's still going to be good for them in the long term.

2251
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:21,360
So GameGuru in our chat room says, so they aren't going to sell Civ 5 and Call of Duty.

2252
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,360
That's a good point.

2253
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:27,680
I mean, you get such huge releases included, it's hard to like not have it.

2254
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,680
You know what I mean?

2255
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:32,800
And honestly, I think that Steam would facilitate more sales, at least in those big titles,

2256
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,240
but I can see smaller developers maybe, well, honestly though, it's still a friend of smaller

2257
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:42,400
developers too, because they come up as budget games, so I'm just saying.

2258
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,400
All right.

2259
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:48,720
Well, anyhow, let me talk about a new sales model that's out there from THQ.

2260
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:53,320
Apparently, they've decided that $39.99 is the place to be.

2261
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:59,120
Hey, this doesn't sound so bad, although careful, there might be kind of a but here.

2262
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:00,120
Here's the deal.

2263
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:05,440
This is a quote from the Capital Markets Conference from THQ President Brian Farrell.

2264
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:09,640
Quote, what we're thinking about the business is we're turning it on its head a little bit.

2265
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:13,520
It's not how high can a price we get, but how many users.

2266
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:19,200
So when we launched MX versus ATV at $59.99, we do some units, and then when we brought

2267
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:23,840
the price down to the mass market friendly price of $39.99, it would just pop.

2268
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:27,660
So the thinking at this time is, let's initially launch at $39.99.

2269
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:32,400
It's a AAA title at that price point, but then win a series of DLCs so people can extend

2270
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,400
their experience.

2271
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:34,400
Hmm.

2272
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:39,080
Isn't THQ also one of those companies that does the $10 online thing?

2273
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:41,080
Yes.

2274
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:45,280
But doesn't that seem to sting a lot less when they're only charging $40 for the game

2275
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:46,640
to begin with?

2276
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:50,920
Well, $10 online is only if you buy the game used.

2277
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,440
True, true.

2278
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:57,120
Well, I mean, I'm liking this idea of the fact that maybe the game will only cost $40,

2279
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,120
you know?

2280
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:02,680
It's a nice idea.

2281
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:06,680
We've heard a lot about this kind of stuff, though, is that games tend to sell, I mean,

2282
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:11,800
this is kind of a duh, but some games, I should say, have really sold better after a price

2283
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:12,800
reduction, right?

2284
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:13,800
Yeah.

2285
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,160
Like, DJ Hero was an example.

2286
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:17,160
We had the first DJ Hero game.

2287
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:21,880
Didn't sell too hot for a few, but then they cut the price and it sells a lot.

2288
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:24,480
Interesting, huh?

2289
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:25,480
Mm-hmm.

2290
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:31,040
So, that could be interesting if it starts this new trend, although, I don't know, you

2291
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:34,360
know, they have to make back their money, but I think the guy makes a good point.

2292
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:39,280
If you have more users, even if it's a lower price, you still end up making the same amount

2293
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,160
of money, right?

2294
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,280
Maybe even more.

2295
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:47,720
Well, and they're saying more opportunity for DLC, because if you have, you know, two

2296
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:53,320
users that are willing to buy the game for $39.99, and, you know, versus, you know, one

2297
01:51:53,320 --> 01:52:00,440
person that wants to buy it for, you know, $59.99, then you have the opportunity to sell

2298
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:05,080
two $10 DLCs, or multiple $10 DLCs.

2299
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:06,080
Good point.

2300
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,080
Ooh, Robert M. has a really good comment in our chatroom at chat.orangewise.com.

2301
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:15,760
Would the original Katamari have been as successful at more than $20?

2302
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:16,760
Good point.

2303
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:19,520
That's what really drove sales of that first game, was the fact that it was a $20 game,

2304
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:23,200
and everybody was like, you gotta get this Katamari game, it's only 20 bucks, it's awesome.

2305
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,800
But if it had been a, you know, $50 game or whatever they were charging at the time, would

2306
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,480
it have been as exciting?

2307
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,120
I don't know.

2308
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:32,720
Hmm.

2309
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:33,720
So anyhow.

2310
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:35,200
Loki, what do you have for us?

2311
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:37,260
Ah, yes.

2312
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:43,800
So there's more fun stuff we can talk about, and this is more THQ-related things.

2313
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:48,160
I don't know if I should be excited or disappointed that they're planning on doing this, but Saints

2314
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:52,680
Row apparently is gonna become a movie, according to THQ.

2315
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:58,520
They're gonna be announcing it next month, although they've just announced it, I don't

2316
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,520
know, I guess officially.

2317
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,520
So they've announced that an announcement is coming?

2318
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,960
Um, yes.

2319
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:11,120
And so apparently, I guess, they're gonna have some sort of movie coming out.

2320
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:14,400
I think it's gonna be kind of cool, because, you know, Saints Row, unlike Grand Theft Auto,

2321
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:19,960
it does have like a single storyline that goes along, whereas Grand Theft Auto is kind

2322
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,800
of all over the place.

2323
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:24,280
So it could work, perhaps.

2324
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:27,760
I definitely think that they should get the people that did the voice acting for the game,

2325
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,880
you know, kind of in there, so that would be kind of cool.

2326
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,840
But I'd probably go see it.

2327
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:37,000
What would you want to see most in a Saints Row movie?

2328
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,280
How about a good plot?

2329
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:39,280
A musical.

2330
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,120
Um, yeah, a good plot would be nice.

2331
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:43,120
Nudity!

2332
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:46,440
Nudity would be fine, yeah, I don't know.

2333
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,440
Random glitches.

2334
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:55,600
Um, yeah, it could be interesting, I don't know, I would like to see just some of the

2335
01:53:55,600 --> 01:54:00,080
main characters that they have in the game, um, make a return.

2336
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:04,280
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're gonna get into the mailbag, because

2337
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:08,160
we read your emails every week here on the show, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2338
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:09,160
We do.

2339
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:10,160
Yeah, we do.

2340
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:11,160
You better get that ready.

2341
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:15,440
Alright, but anyhow, I wanna read this article here, this is something that Kotaku ran with

2342
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:21,360
earlier this week about the Wii 2, and how it, uh, really isn't necessarily gonna happen

2343
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:26,800
in 2011, but is that just because they really aren't gonna announce one in 2011, or because

2344
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:30,320
they just don't wanna cannibalize sales here in 2010?

2345
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:34,120
And there was a bit of talk with Reggie Fils-Aime, and let me read you some of the, uh, quotes

2346
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:38,520
here, because Kotaku actually kind of asked Reggie about this and said, Wii 2 is not a

2347
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:40,120
must for next holiday?

2348
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:41,860
And he said, no.

2349
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:44,920
But you sort of expect that that answer's coming, because when you announce the Wii

2350
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:47,400
2, then people are gonna stop buying the Wii.

2351
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:52,320
Um, Reggie did say, by the way, that the Wii's sales have, uh, peaked in the system's third

2352
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,320
year.

2353
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:55,940
There are more than 30 million Wiis out there right now.

2354
01:54:55,940 --> 01:55:00,560
He also has these charts and things that show that the Wii is selling now faster than the

2355
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,440
PlayStation 2 was at the same point in time.

2356
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:07,360
23% faster, if you wanna be exact.

2357
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,360
Hmm.

2358
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:13,560
So, anyhow, uh, the Wii 2, um, might come in Christmas 2011, but it's all speculation

2359
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,600
right now.

2360
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:18,740
Of course, Nintendo's really gonna be behind the 3DS next year, we know that.

2361
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:22,000
One interesting other note that Reggie did leave, uh, the interview on.

2362
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,320
As we sit here today, we're saying the Wii has many, many more units to sell.

2363
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:30,740
After we've reached an install base of 45 million units in the US, then we can have

2364
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:33,080
a conversation about the next generation.

2365
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:34,320
Hmm.

2366
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:37,000
I guess we can see kind of where their goals are at.

2367
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,080
But I don't know, what do you guys think?

2368
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,080
Do they need to announce a Wii 2 next year?

2369
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,080
It prints money!

2370
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:45,400
They don't need a new Wii lease.

2371
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:47,080
Wii Reese.

2372
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:51,240
They need a system that's better.

2373
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:56,080
I think, uh, this is funny, cause to me, this and the whole why isn't Metroid selling thing

2374
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:59,200
go hand in hand to me.

2375
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:03,180
And I think the next Wii, one thing Nintendo does pretty well these days is the backwards

2376
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:06,160
compatibility thing, the next Wii will be like a super Wii.

2377
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:09,120
It's gonna be a Wii that runs on HD and it uses all the same stuff.

2378
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:10,120
You know what?

2379
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:15,560
This is my thing, with that comment and everything, the why isn't this selling?

2380
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:18,800
It's not really that he's being that dumb.

2381
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:23,080
It's trying to talk it up so that people will go out and buy it.

2382
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:27,640
I mean, it's just more, we believe in our product, we stand behind it, even though they

2383
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:31,000
may be sitting in a boardroom going, what the hell were they thinking when they wrote

2384
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
the story for this game?

2385
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,680
How can you people be so stupid to not buy this amazing video game?

2386
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:36,680
Exactly.

2387
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:40,800
Going to our chat at chat dot orange launch radio dot com, uh, Casey says, so now they

2388
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,960
are treating their home consoles like they're handhelds with the replacing them with a new

2389
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:45,760
version of the same thing.

2390
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,600
Well, there was all that talk that the Wii was just a souped up GameCube, but at the

2391
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:54,840
same time, the Wii is the most successful console ever, per sales.

2392
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,640
I mean, as much as we sit here and give it a hard time and as much as you might roll

2393
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:03,440
your eyes at games like Metroid Other M, uh, money is what money is.

2394
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:09,800
Let's see, uh, also, um, saying this, uh, GameGuru in our chat room says they want 3DS

2395
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:13,560
to have this Christmas and save Wii 2 for 2012.

2396
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:17,440
I think 3DS for this Christmas, meaning really Christmas 2011.

2397
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,720
And that could very well be the case.

2398
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:23,160
I think the 3DS will really be where it's at next year, but, and it'll print money.

2399
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:24,160
Right?

2400
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:25,160
Salacious Pop?

2401
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:26,160
It'll print money.

2402
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:27,160
Yes.

2403
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:28,160
All right.

2404
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:32,040
Let's go to the email bag, mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com is where you send your

2405
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:36,320
emails every week, dark soccer will dive into the mailbag head first and pull out some of

2406
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:39,120
her favorite emails and read them for you right now.

2407
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:44,400
One of them, um, I'm not going to read the email, um, but in regards to the contest to

2408
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:51,680
get the code for symphony of the night for Xbox live arcade, I said specifically not

2409
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:59,000
orange lounge radio, who is it that is he who shall not be named on comic insanity.

2410
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:06,280
It's called cross promotion as in you kind of got to go listen to both podcasts if you're

2411
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:08,060
going to win.

2412
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:09,840
So no, yes ma'am.

2413
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:14,040
You're automatically disqualified for not following the rules.

2414
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,040
I don't know.

2415
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,660
I might give you another chance.

2416
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:21,200
Way to scare off the listeners.

2417
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:25,840
I heard the story about GameStop that had the call of duty black ops.

2418
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:30,800
I shop at that store, but the story confuses me.

2419
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,080
Why would this particular robbery about my little town make all of the game blogs?

2420
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:38,580
The only thing I can think of is that it promotes call of duty.

2421
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:43,880
So the story by making the rounds is inadvertently condoning the robbery for the sake of advertisement.

2422
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:47,680
The store is actually pretty nice and in a nice area.

2423
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:49,200
It's odd that it was robbed.

2424
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:53,800
The highways allow for a very quick trip to I 95 and probably made it to the street vendors

2425
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,320
in New York City and D.C. by Sunday.

2426
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,320
Later rob a book.

2427
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:59,320
I can actually think of a lot of answers to the questions.

2428
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:01,680
Why was it so important?

2429
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:07,000
Well, it probably wasn't in the scope of things, but think about it made the news for the same

2430
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:12,000
reason that all these murders that involve fights over Xbox controllers and stuff make

2431
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
news.

2432
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,960
I mean, it just kind of remotely has to do with video games and so people talk about

2433
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:16,960
it.

2434
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:22,340
Also, it was probably all over the place because you said it happened in a place you didn't

2435
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:26,820
expect it to happen and when these sorts of things happens in places where, you know,

2436
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:27,860
you kind of go, wow, really?

2437
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:28,860
It happens there.

2438
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:29,860
People setting fire.

2439
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:30,860
Makes people talk.

2440
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:36,600
In the back of a GameStop slash Macy's in Roseville and you can still see the broken

2441
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:37,600
roof.

2442
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:40,960
And because that was like a super nice mall, if that had happened at Florin Mall, it would

2443
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:43,960
have been just like, oh, Sunday.

2444
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:44,960
Seriously.

2445
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:50,880
But, well, I mean, I worked at GNC and got held up at gunpoint.

2446
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:55,000
This guy was going around and hitting GNCs.

2447
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,260
It was my first job when I moved out here.

2448
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:01,180
So I was like, dude, you suck.

2449
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:07,360
Those giant tubs of bulk gainer 4,000 are like 60 bucks a bottle, so they got money.

2450
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:11,640
The moron came after I had done a deposit in the safe.

2451
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:14,200
And yeah, I could get into the safe, but I just said, dude, we've got a safe.

2452
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:15,760
I can't get into it.

2453
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:17,140
It's on time lock.

2454
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:18,140
It's I can't get in.

2455
02:00:18,140 --> 02:00:24,240
When, when, when I'm in panic mode, I either will go completely crazy or completely calm.

2456
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,320
And I went completely calm.

2457
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:26,960
And so I could like write down the make of his gun.

2458
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:27,960
What he looked like.

2459
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:28,960
I drew the guy for the cops.

2460
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:29,960
It was kind of fun.

2461
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:30,960
That's awesome.

2462
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:31,960
And they caught him.

2463
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:32,960
Good times.

2464
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:38,640
Like what idiot robs a GNC is the same thing as what idiot robs a GameStop in an ice area.

2465
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:41,920
Anyway, what idiot burns down a GameStop in a nice mall?

2466
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,480
Oh, this guy was on the drugs.

2467
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:50,400
Well, and every news station in the entirety of Northern California and CNN, probably.

2468
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:56,160
This one person on this Facebook, his friend of his says, dude, you are stupid on his Facebook.

2469
02:00:56,160 --> 02:01:00,920
A guy that I was sitting next to in my magazine thing, went to high school with him.

2470
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:01,920
Oh, random.

2471
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:02,920
Yeah.

2472
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:03,920
Okay.

2473
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:04,920
Next one.

2474
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:08,940
Just to ask an actually intelligent question for change with the latest incarnations of

2475
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:12,080
these games are reasonably recently published.

2476
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:16,480
What do you think was the most influential for defining the console first person genre,

2477
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,040
Halo or Goldeneye?

2478
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:22,440
Or as the giant bomb guys were discussing Call of Duty 4 for its multiplayer structure

2479
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:23,440
or none of the above.

2480
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:26,960
Thanks as always, Robert M. I'm going to say Goldeneye right off the bat and Goldeneye

2481
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:30,760
did have multiplayer.

2482
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:31,920
Slow down for me.

2483
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:36,360
The question is console first person shooter the most impactful on consoles?

2484
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:41,480
What was more influential for defining the console first person genre?

2485
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:44,400
Halo or Goldeneye or Call of Duty 4?

2486
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:49,440
I would say Halo 2 because of online Xbox Live.

2487
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:55,280
And I think that really set the stage for everything after it was Xbox Live.

2488
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:58,920
Not the original Halo didn't have Xbox Live, but Halo 2, I think was Xbox Live.

2489
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:02,440
I still say Duke Nukem 3D.

2490
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:08,100
But then when I go influential first person shooters, honestly, I go back to PC games

2491
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:16,560
because my mind says, but, but, but, but Quake and Half Life and Doom and Wolfenstein 3D

2492
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:17,560
really.

2493
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:20,680
Quake 3 was out on Dreamcast with internet play.

2494
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:22,000
Interesting.

2495
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,640
So still, though, not quite the impact, I think, of the Halo 2 on Xbox Live.

2496
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:30,000
But Halo was by no means the first.

2497
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
No.

2498
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Oh, no.

2499
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,800
Well, Super, I'm sorry, Wolfenstein 3D was on Super Nintendo.

2500
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,680
But in the US, the Satellaview thing never went through.

2501
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:44,360
But I'm saying, you know, I'm going for talking about online play on a console.

2502
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:47,560
And I don't really think that there were first person, you know, shooters like that that

2503
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:53,400
played through the Satellaview or through the Genesis Link.

2504
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:59,120
But for Dreamcast, Quake 3 was like the big modem game that you played.

2505
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:02,880
PSO didn't work on the US one.

2506
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:08,560
First, first person shooters that ended up on console were usually ports that came from

2507
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:09,560
the PC.

2508
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:13,680
First, sold a couple million copies and then, okay, now there's a console version where

2509
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:15,320
they tweak the controls.

2510
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:21,440
Goldeneye is the first one that was relevant for consoles where it was a console exclusive.

2511
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:25,320
And because we've gone into the whole fight before about how I only play first person

2512
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:28,940
shooters on a PC because I need a keyboard and mouse.

2513
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:31,720
When Goldeneye came out, I was like, okay, this is on console.

2514
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:35,680
I'm going to sit and figure out how to play this game because it's awesome.

2515
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:40,400
So I think Goldeneye is really the first one that made console first person shooters like

2516
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,040
stand out.

2517
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:46,780
I got to give this one a shout out, though, even though the game was kind of crap.

2518
02:03:46,780 --> 02:03:50,720
It was a really early type of first person game called Baseball 2000.

2519
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:51,720
Does anyone remember this one?

2520
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:52,720
Yes, I remember Baseball 2000.

2521
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:55,960
It was a Game Boy game, I believe, and they had it on Super Nintendo.

2522
02:03:55,960 --> 02:04:00,360
And it was the whole, like, it was a very rudimentary shooter game.

2523
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:04,400
I only throw that out there not because necessarily it was a great game, but because it was kind

2524
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:12,280
of the first type of maze, shoot your opponents type of thing that was only on consoles.

2525
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:15,880
But I wouldn't recommend you, like, run out and find a copy because it was kind of shit.

2526
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:21,100
It was a lot of crap, but you know, but for me, my first LAN experience was playing Duke

2527
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:22,100
Nukem 3D.

2528
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:23,100
Oh, yeah, Duke Nukem.

2529
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:24,100
Oh, man.

2530
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:25,100
That was crazy.

2531
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:26,100
At my first Mobicon.

2532
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:29,780
Oh, and one more first person type of game, even though it was a multiplayer.

2533
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:33,800
Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo in all its surround sound glory, because those first

2534
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:36,320
person shooter phases scare the crap out of me.

2535
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:39,960
What if Velociraptor would run up behind you in all his pixelated open mouth glory?

2536
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:47,720
I love that voice, you sound like Chewbacca.

2537
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:48,720
So there you go.

2538
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:51,360
There's a variety of first person shooter games for you.

2539
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:54,720
I think all of those have had impact in different ways.

2540
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:55,720
Was that it for emails?

2541
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:56,720
No.

2542
02:04:56,720 --> 02:04:57,720
Oh.

2543
02:04:57,720 --> 02:04:58,720
Well, then what's next?

2544
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:00,040
Just assuming, huh?

2545
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:01,040
Well.

2546
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:02,600
Ignoring our poor listeners.

2547
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:03,720
Well.

2548
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,660
Dear OLR.

2549
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:07,000
Dear listener.

2550
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,040
I was listening to Episode 388, and while listening to your discussion of the recently

2551
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:15,840
announced delay of Chinese Democracy, I was mortified by the derision I heard.

2552
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:19,960
Sure Chinese Democracy was supposed to be a PS3 launch game, and sure Chinese Democracy

2553
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:25,440
is touted as the best racing game of all time, but how does any of that change with another

2554
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:26,440
delay?

2555
02:05:26,440 --> 02:05:27,440
Oh, I see what you're doing.

2556
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,440
Yes.

2557
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:32,560
Chinese Democracy is like a girlfriend you have that unexpectedly moves to India.

2558
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:37,360
Yes, she keeps on extending her stay in India, but she does send you saucy pictures every

2559
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:41,180
so often, so she keeps on delaying her return home, and yes, she does occasionally call

2560
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:46,440
you Tom, but is any of that any reason to break up with her?

2561
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:49,120
I will make a bold declaration here and now.

2562
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:52,480
Chinese Democracy will come out this calendar year.

2563
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:56,440
I will go one step further when Chinese Democracy is released this year.

2564
02:05:56,440 --> 02:06:02,000
What if, but when, I will buy each and every person in the all-games community a bottle

2565
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
of Dr. Pepper?

2566
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Nasty.

2567
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,040
Hey, I like Dr. Pepper.

2568
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:07,040
You're welcome to it.

2569
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:10,360
I am that confident in Chinese Democracy coming out this year.

2570
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:12,160
Stay black, redertainment.

2571
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:17,320
There's a note, offer valid only to residents of the continuous, I think it means continental,

2572
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:20,480
United States, and contingent on Loki wearing the tingle costume.

2573
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:21,480
Oops.

2574
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:24,120
But he didn't say tinkle, he said tinkle.

2575
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:25,120
Tinkle.

2576
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:28,800
I don't think they were going to dress him up in yellow foil.

2577
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,640
First off, I see what you did there.

2578
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:35,920
Second off, you know what's funny, and this is so true, I get what you're trying to parallel,

2579
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39,100
and if you didn't pick up on it, obviously it's the Gran Turismo 5 thing, right?

2580
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:43,200
But here's the funny thing that I think takes your parallel one step further.

2581
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:49,000
When Chinese Democracy finally came out, no one cared anymore.

2582
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Just saying.

2583
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,240
Well, I will say this.

2584
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:56,400
It is going to be this year, from what I understand.

2585
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:57,720
And no one cares anymore.

2586
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:05,080
No, actually, that's wrong, because Dan and his cousin were just talking about it yesterday.

2587
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:06,080
Two people care anymore.

2588
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:07,080
Just kidding.

2589
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:09,760
And we're talking about other people asking about it.

2590
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:11,240
Ah, fine, fine, fine.

2591
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:12,800
People do still care.

2592
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:17,560
I don't think as many as would have cared two years ago.

2593
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:18,560
But we'll see.

2594
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:21,800
Sales will be where it is all at.

2595
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:43,640
Now is the part of the show where we get angsty and rude and mad because, well, we can.

2596
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:52,240
I'm giving a fork you to the culinary department at my school for, um, well, I was all excited

2597
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:56,080
and giddy because even though they were a week past the deadline and getting me their

2598
02:07:56,080 --> 02:08:03,280
stuff, three of the recipes that they gave me were not even remotely related to any of

2599
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,280
the pictures I got.

2600
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:09,120
On top of that, the pictures were in 240 dpi and I needed them at least 300 dpi so I could

2601
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:10,120
use them.

2602
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:13,360
So now I've had to have people do stuff to the pictures for me, thank goodness I can

2603
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:17,960
delegate this stuff so that I can use the pictures and I still can't use as many of

2604
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:20,060
the recipes as I wanted to.

2605
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:25,280
So they're gonna just gonna have to deal with only having three recipes in the damn magazine

2606
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:28,720
because they couldn't get their crap together and if they do this crap next year, they don't

2607
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:29,720
get a section.

2608
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:35,520
I'm a little, I'm a little irritated at them and they also didn't give us a title for their

2609
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:38,120
section so I'm gonna call it porky culinary.

2610
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:45,080
I'm probably not, but that's what I feel.

2611
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:48,080
Well tell us how you really feel.

2612
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:49,080
Uh, Loki!

2613
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:55,200
Um, I guess F you to, um, my JTAG system for being very finicky because it was red rained

2614
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:59,600
actually earlier this week and I got it fixed and so I was like, ooh yeah, I can work back

2615
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:04,480
on my, uh, Grand Theft Auto stuff and now it's doing this stupid E79 error crap.

2616
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:09,040
I think that may go away though because that's supposed to be a firmware, like, glitch or,

2617
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:12,480
you know, corrupted firmware or something and I'm updating the firmware anyways on it

2618
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:15,920
so, uh, it's not a big deal, I guess.

2619
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:16,920
But that's still something.

2620
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:19,120
At least I know how to fix it.

2621
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:21,360
Fix it by breaking it further.

2622
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:22,360
That's science.

2623
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:26,240
Uh, I want to give an F you to that salad I had for lunch.

2624
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:29,120
I don't know what you did but, um, I didn't like it.

2625
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:33,720
Uh, and then I want to give an F you to pink eye because it continues to destroy my life.

2626
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:37,000
Um, apparently, I don't think I have it.

2627
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,340
I'm always, I'm always paranoid I'm gonna get it again.

2628
02:09:39,340 --> 02:09:42,080
Apparently now there's like a big old outbreak in my work and a couple of my coworkers got

2629
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:43,080
it too.

2630
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:44,080
Although it took a week.

2631
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:45,080
So...

2632
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:46,080
I don't have it.

2633
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:47,080
I don't have it.

2634
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:48,680
And I'm thinking like, okay, but it took a week.

2635
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:51,000
Something's wrong in my work, I think.

2636
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,800
Like it wouldn't have taken a week for my coworkers to get it from me.

2637
02:09:54,800 --> 02:10:02,440
I think some disgruntled, uh, person, I'll say customer, came into the front door just

2638
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:04,360
long enough to spread the infection.

2639
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:08,640
I think we're just all becoming zombies, but like I'm here every time my eye itches, I'm

2640
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:10,120
like, Oh my God, his big eye.

2641
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:11,120
All right.

2642
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:12,120
It's called allergies.

2643
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:14,120
No, I don't think it's allergies.

2644
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:19,660
Alan, do you have anything if you want to go?

2645
02:10:19,660 --> 02:10:20,660
Not really.

2646
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:21,660
Had a pretty mellow week.

2647
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:23,360
Well, F you to being so happy.

2648
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:27,900
I guess F you to having to get up early tomorrow, like an employed person without actually having

2649
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:28,900
a job.

2650
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:31,840
These are real problems.

2651
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:32,840
Yeah.

2652
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:33,840
I know.

2653
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:34,840
Right.

2654
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:35,840
All right.

2655
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:40,520
Let's move on to a couple more news stories and then your phone calls where anything can

2656
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:41,520
happen.

2657
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:42,520
Joy and rapture.

2658
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:43,520
Loki, what do you have for us?

2659
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:44,960
More rapture though.

2660
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:48,160
Um, super Mario brothers three has actually been remade.

2661
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:56,360
Uh, funny enough, it's a mod, uh, to the new super Mario brothers DS, um, game and they

2662
02:10:56,360 --> 02:11:00,200
did new super Mario brothers three and it's kind of cool.

2663
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:05,040
It's a completely renewed, well, redone game for all the Mario brothers three levels plus

2664
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:10,680
some additional challenge levels, uh, plus some actual like hybrid levels with like,

2665
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:15,800
you know, the, um, Metroid stuff in there and all sorts of other crazy stuff.

2666
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:24,880
Um, you can download the actual mod for the ROM, um, off of, uh, GBA temp.net and, uh,

2667
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:26,960
it's actually pretty awesome looking.

2668
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:29,400
I'm thinking about checking it out with my, uh,

2669
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:30,800
wait, this is a ROM.

2670
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:31,800
What system is this?

2671
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:38,760
It's a mod for ROM for the DS, uh, have, you know, jail, not necessarily jailbreak device,

2672
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:45,200
but like, you know, a device to play ROMs on your, like an R four, like an R four.

2673
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,200
Yes.

2674
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:51,160
You can download this and play it and it's pretty shady, but interesting.

2675
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:52,160
I'm watching the video.

2676
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:53,160
It's really sweet.

2677
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:54,160
Hmm.

2678
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:55,160
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

2679
02:11:55,160 --> 02:12:02,080
It looks like they had to do a few creative liberties, but still, uh, you know, overall

2680
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:03,080
very impressive.

2681
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:04,080
Mm hmm.

2682
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:06,440
Good for them.

2683
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:10,620
How many, how long till Nintendo sues?

2684
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:13,540
At least they didn't say new Super Mario brothers three.

2685
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:14,540
It's on like don't.

2686
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:17,800
So in that case you want to get, well, the fact that it's been on the internet longer

2687
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:22,100
than a day, it'll never go away.

2688
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:23,100
Everyone has it now.

2689
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:26,400
Well, then a follow up to something we were discussing just a minute ago.

2690
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:30,100
I think this is an appropriate last main story for tonight.

2691
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:36,360
Gran Turismo five has a release date and I would like my Dr Pepper please.

2692
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:39,920
November 24th is the day.

2693
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:46,240
This is coming from a polyphony digital's Kazunori Yamauchi did we not call it satisfying

2694
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:50,200
the loyal Gran Turismo followers is at the heart of all our efforts, which is why it

2695
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:53,920
was such a difficult decision to delay the release of the release of the game and one

2696
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:55,400
which you did not take lightly.

2697
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:58,760
I can only apologize to everyone for making you wait so long and I hope that when you

2698
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:02,720
try out the wealth of driving experiences available in Gran Turismo five, you will not

2699
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:04,080
be disappointed.

2700
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:05,080
So there it is.

2701
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:07,200
November 24th is the big day.

2702
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,880
That's um, really soon.

2703
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:14,080
Was it 200 cars, 200 plus cars, 1033 cars.

2704
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:16,320
Oh wow.

2705
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,620
I want my Bugatti.

2706
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:20,840
Can I race like my Honda Civic?

2707
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:27,280
Can I just probably whatever the racing model would be good to have cart racing.

2708
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:28,880
Nice and NASCAR, but no Mario Kart.

2709
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:30,280
I just want my Bugatti.

2710
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:31,280
I'll be happy.

2711
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:33,020
Well, you don't have a track editor, Rob.

2712
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:36,860
So maybe you will get Mario Kart.

2713
02:13:36,860 --> 02:13:39,840
If there's a track editor, then it's just a matter of time before Mario Kart circuit

2714
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:40,840
shows up.

2715
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:41,840
That's for sure.

2716
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:49,840
So I guess we should go ahead and open up our Skype line, shall we one eight seven seven

2717
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:53,100
game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

2718
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:55,760
Give us a call right now during the show.

2719
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,600
We are, oops, I should actually, Oh no, we are set to taking calls.

2720
02:13:58,600 --> 02:13:59,600
My bad.

2721
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:02,320
One eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

2722
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:04,300
The Skype line is open for business.

2723
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:05,300
Give us a call.

2724
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:06,300
We'll talk.

2725
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:08,200
Meanwhile, uh, last minute stories.

2726
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:13,520
Yes, and it was not even a week after the new dashboard came out and they've already

2727
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:17,040
ported it over to J tag systems for the Xbox three 60.

2728
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:24,320
So now all those people with J tags like myself can play, you know, connect games.

2729
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:30,740
Of course, for people like me that bought a connect system with connect or a slim system

2730
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:39,200
with connect, I had to order a really expensive adapter to play said thing on my old consoles.

2731
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:40,200
You're so cryptic.

2732
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:41,200
I love it.

2733
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:43,640
Let's go to El Telefonos and take some calls.

2734
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:45,240
Hi, you're on orange lounge radio.

2735
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:46,240
Who's this?

2736
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:49,440
It's the only listener with the fastest internet finger in the whole wide world.

2737
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:50,440
Wrong.

2738
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:53,080
Clearly you are the king of iron fingering finger.

2739
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:54,080
What's on your mind?

2740
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:57,880
Wait, well I can barely hear you guys.

2741
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:00,880
You are the king of iron fingering.

2742
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:03,000
I try.

2743
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,680
What's up?

2744
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:07,680
Did he just cut out?

2745
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:10,360
Rama, you there?

2746
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:11,360
I'm right here.

2747
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,360
Hi.

2748
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:13,360
What's on your mind?

2749
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:14,360
Okay.

2750
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:17,920
I don't know why you brought the whole family matters thing at the beginning of the show

2751
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:19,840
because I can reference that and it's really sad.

2752
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:20,840
Wait, wait, wait.

2753
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:21,840
Hold on.

2754
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,240
Didn't you hear us talking about the new cause or the, no, I'm sorry.

2755
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:24,240
Not the Cosby's.

2756
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:29,040
Yes, I did, and you also mentioned family matters as well.

2757
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:30,040
Yes.

2758
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:31,040
Okay.

2759
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:37,480
To clear that up, the middle daughter, she only did two adult movies.

2760
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:38,480
Only two?

2761
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:40,480
Just two?

2762
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:42,040
Hello.

2763
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:43,520
Hello.

2764
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:47,200
Oh, he's gone.

2765
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,760
Oh well.

2766
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:52,840
Man, he wanted to talk about pornography.

2767
02:15:52,840 --> 02:15:53,840
And that's the internet sensor.

2768
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:54,840
I don't know if you can hear us.

2769
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:55,840
We can't hear you.

2770
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:56,840
All right.

2771
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:57,840
He's been bleeped out.

2772
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:59,320
I have to hang up on him.

2773
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:00,320
I'm sorry, guys.

2774
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:01,320
That was so dirty.

2775
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:02,960
We had to bleep that out from our show.

2776
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:06,960
I can't believe you and your language.

2777
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:07,960
All right.

2778
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:12,960
Well, apparently she was only ever actually in two movies, but you know, it's just like

2779
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:15,440
the whole new Super Mario Brothers thing hitting the internet.

2780
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:19,120
Once your vajay is on the internet, always on the internet.

2781
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:21,680
Just ask Paris Hilton, right?

2782
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:24,400
It was just that one little homemade porn they did.

2783
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:25,400
Just one!

2784
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:27,640
She's a talentless hack.

2785
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:29,160
And I'm talking about the porno, too.

2786
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:34,360
You know what's crazy is that how much money does she have now, and like, who was she before

2787
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:35,440
that porn came out?

2788
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:40,840
She sent an heiress to the Hilton Hotel, you know, Fortune or whatever.

2789
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,040
And no one cared until we all saw her vajay.

2790
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:45,680
And she was terrible at porn.

2791
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:46,680
She was not good.

2792
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:51,120
I give her a thumbs down.

2793
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,120
You all right over there, Dark Soccer?

2794
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:53,120
You fighting with something?

2795
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,280
I hate this shit.

2796
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:58,080
Let's go to the phones and try to take another call.

2797
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:59,080
Hi, everyone.

2798
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:00,080
Who's this?

2799
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:01,640
Yes, it's Legend of Zaku here.

2800
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:02,640
Hey, Legend of Zaku.

2801
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:03,640
How are you doing?

2802
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:05,960
Oh, pretty good as usual.

2803
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:10,000
Just trying to like get in, you know, the phone calls before going to Betty Buys.

2804
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,200
Well, what's on your mind tonight?

2805
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:16,520
Anyways, I'd like to, I guess, I don't know if you brought it up about, you know, harmonics

2806
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:19,320
getting put up on the market.

2807
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:22,480
Why yes, it was our first story tonight.

2808
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,480
So I don't know.

2809
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:28,520
I'm thinking, I don't know what good will come out of like whoever else owns harmonics

2810
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:29,520
at this point.

2811
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:34,880
I mean, unless, of course, they go back to Activision, which is like a really, really

2812
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:35,880
fucked up situation.

2813
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:39,040
You know, I don't think it'll ever happen just because of battered white syndrome of

2814
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:42,380
the experience, the whole guitar hero thing.

2815
02:17:42,380 --> 02:17:47,480
So I'm willing, you know, I was wondering, I guess we should propose like taking bests

2816
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:50,760
to see who will be their next suitor.

2817
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:51,760
It'll be EA.

2818
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:53,200
Are you sure?

2819
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:54,200
Yes.

2820
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:56,160
I mean, what certainty do you have?

2821
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:57,800
Because it logically makes sense.

2822
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:00,240
EA has been publishing their games for a while.

2823
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:01,360
What other suitors are there?

2824
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:05,760
Bobby Kotick came out and said, I should have bought harmonics when I had the chance.

2825
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:07,560
I underestimated them.

2826
02:18:07,560 --> 02:18:10,120
And you know, I think he's kind of already missed the boat on that one.

2827
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:14,080
Konami, as much as the fanboys want that to happen, they can't afford it.

2828
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:16,720
Ubisoft, I just don't, EA makes sense.

2829
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:19,440
I've been surprised before.

2830
02:18:19,440 --> 02:18:20,480
Maybe I'll be surprised again.

2831
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:21,480
Who knows?

2832
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:23,720
It could be something completely fucking random like Sega.

2833
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:26,520
Like could you, who knows?

2834
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:30,600
But I'm thinking the Shumans are definitely, you're right, EA and then Konami.

2835
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:36,160
Konami making more logical sense just because it'll pretty much rein in all the musical

2836
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,880
game talent into one house.

2837
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:39,880
It would be interesting.

2838
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:44,960
But again, I think that's more of a fanboys dream because this might be a harsh thing

2839
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:50,000
to say, but I'm not sure what musical talent house is left at Konami.

2840
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,160
Poor Naoki Madaya is fighting for his life over there.

2841
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:57,960
And you know, he's a great guy, really sweet, nice guy, but Dance Masters was extremely

2842
02:18:57,960 --> 02:19:00,360
rushed and mostly recycled.

2843
02:19:00,360 --> 02:19:03,520
Although I think Dance Masters 2 could be very interesting, I don't know if they'll

2844
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:06,920
get the chance unless the game does really well in Japan, which it might.

2845
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:11,920
Well, I mean, on one hand, you still have those old timers, the ones who basically started

2846
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:17,840
the whole music game genre in Konami, you still have most of them still, you know, whatever's

2847
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:22,360
left of them trying to see whether or not they can take, you know, if they make the

2848
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:27,480
argument that maybe they should bring harmonics on board, then it will be in safer hands because

2849
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:31,840
you know, you have a company that has a crap ton more experience with that whole genre

2850
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:38,160
than EA would ever do in their history.

2851
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:40,920
As much as we want to sit here and say it makes sense.

2852
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:46,400
I just think it's a little bit of a wishful thinking and I honestly think EA is already

2853
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:48,240
having those talks.

2854
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:52,680
But then again, as long as EA doesn't rock the boat, you know, the idea is whoever buys

2855
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:57,680
them has to give them the autonomy, the light of day to operate it as an independent company

2856
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:58,680
in that sense.

2857
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:02,800
Maybe it won't be such a terrible thing if EA buys them.

2858
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:04,800
It may not be such a terrible thing if EA buys them.

2859
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:06,880
EA has access to all the music.

2860
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:11,080
On one hand, I wouldn't want EA to buy them just because I know it would be a lot better

2861
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:17,280
than Activision or any other company that would just like, you know, drain them and

2862
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:21,520
make them and whore them out every like every year for a single new release.

2863
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:23,880
No, I think we can all agree not Activision.

2864
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:26,760
No, yeah, of course, obviously.

2865
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:29,800
They're going to milk that proverbial cap and that's pretty much what's killing that

2866
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:30,800
genre.

2867
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:34,880
You have companies that are going, you know, they're doing, you know, twice or three times

2868
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:39,600
as worse as Konami has ever done in terms of milking out the franchise.

2869
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:43,820
I know if one could argue, you could say the same thing with DDR, but there were certain

2870
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:49,920
periods in that, you know, in that game's history where there was time in between any

2871
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:54,360
major release, especially in the arcade versions.

2872
02:20:54,360 --> 02:21:22,120
And that goes to show, boys and girls, that you don't let any big corporate non-video

2873
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:27,520
game company buy a video game company for the sake of doing it, because chances are,

2874
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:31,600
I don't care if they have the best connections to your genre, they're going to, they're going

2875
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,560
to pimp you out and bleed you dry.

2876
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:37,400
Well, but here's the thing, I'm not so sure I totally agree with that.

2877
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:41,560
Like I'm all for the whole like, I'm all for the idea of Fight the Man and all that stuff

2878
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:45,320
and Stay Independent and all that, but I wonder if Rock Band would have been quite the cultural

2879
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:49,640
phenomenon if it hadn't been attached to MTV and Viacom.

2880
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:54,440
I'll tell you this much, that Beatles game would have never happened without the, that

2881
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:58,080
Beatles game would never have happened without the Viacom.

2882
02:21:58,080 --> 02:21:59,640
You're right, yeah.

2883
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:03,840
I mean, they have the connections, but on the other hand, they don't understand the

2884
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,760
business, they don't understand the video game industry that well.

2885
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:11,040
They just see it as something they could easily ride in the short term.

2886
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:14,180
And now that they think they've ridden it to full term, because unfortunately the Beatles

2887
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:19,760
game did not perform to expectations, but there's a whole variety of reasons why they

2888
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:20,760
haven't.

2889
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:25,120
Same thing with corporate America, it's mostly short-sighted, especially those guys at Viacom.

2890
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:28,240
All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls.

2891
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:29,240
Thank you very much.

2892
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:30,240
Good one, though.

2893
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,240
Take care.

2894
02:22:31,240 --> 02:22:33,240
Have a good one.

2895
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:34,240
Bye-bye.

2896
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:41,040
So, yeah, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangeallentrader.com, lots of good stuff

2897
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:46,000
that we're getting in our chat room here.

2898
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,720
Some folks are saying, AkumaJP says in our chat room, I'm not saying Konami is buying

2899
02:22:49,720 --> 02:22:52,160
anything, but Konami is not that small.

2900
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:54,320
They're in a lot of businesses, not just games.

2901
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:59,560
Here's my reasoning for saying that, is that I think a lot of that is very Japanese-based,

2902
02:22:59,560 --> 02:23:04,060
and Harmonix is also an American developer, and Konami has really scaled back their operations

2903
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:05,060
here in America.

2904
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:10,440
I mean, some of the best music stuff they were producing was out of Hawaii, gone, and

2905
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:11,440
then Emeryville, gone.

2906
02:23:11,440 --> 02:23:12,920
Or, no, was it Emeryville?

2907
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:17,840
No, they were in, somewhere in the North Bay, or Bay Area.

2908
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:18,840
Not San Rafael.

2909
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:19,840
They were...

2910
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:20,840
San Leandro?

2911
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:21,840
No, not San Leandro.

2912
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:22,840
They were...

2913
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:23,840
Tiburon?

2914
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:24,840
No.

2915
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:25,840
No, I think it was around San Rafael.

2916
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:26,840
I thought.

2917
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:29,840
Well, regardless, they were in the Bay, and now they're not anymore.

2918
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:31,880
Was it in Redwood City or something?

2919
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:32,880
Yeah.

2920
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:33,880
Redwood City.

2921
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:34,880
No, that's in Washington.

2922
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:35,880
No.

2923
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:36,880
No, that's Redmond, is Washington.

2924
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:37,880
Redmond.

2925
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:38,880
Yeah, no.

2926
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:39,880
It's somewhere.

2927
02:23:39,880 --> 02:23:40,880
Yeah.

2928
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:44,320
The point is, they've scaled back their American operations quite a bit, so unless they've

2929
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:49,360
got the money to throw down to try and expand it again, I don't know if I see that happening.

2930
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:55,840
Anyhow, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word if

2931
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:57,280
you want to give us a call.

2932
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,400
We're taking calls right now.

2933
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:02,320
Any other last minute stories you want to get to, Loki, while we wait for some calls?

2934
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:04,600
If any of you are going to come in?

2935
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:05,600
Let's see.

2936
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:08,800
Mushi Hime Sama, Bug Panic is coming out.

2937
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,800
Hime.

2938
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:13,800
Mushi Hime Sama, Bug Panic is coming out on iPhone.

2939
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,600
Mushroom Princess.

2940
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:18,120
November 18th.

2941
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:20,680
I'm looking forward to that.

2942
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:22,200
It's actually a cave adventure game.

2943
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,760
That's the Castlevania person doing music, right?

2944
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:25,760
Yes, it is.

2945
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:26,760
I remember that from the previous show.

2946
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:34,280
The actual Mushi Hime Sama is a shooter, but this is an adventure game.

2947
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:35,280
Gotcha.

2948
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:36,280
I have covered this.

2949
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:37,280
All right.

2950
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,280
Call us, people!

2951
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:39,880
Call us, people!

2952
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:41,960
It's still a shooter.

2953
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:44,360
It's just she's running around instead.

2954
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:46,000
Wow, it works.

2955
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,400
Like right as she said that, DarkSakura, our phones started lighting off the hook.

2956
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:50,400
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2957
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:51,400
Who's this?

2958
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,400
Hey, this is X-Link.

2959
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:54,120
Hey, it's like all our regular callers tonight.

2960
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:55,120
What's on your mind, buddy?

2961
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:56,120
Hey, not much.

2962
02:24:56,120 --> 02:24:58,400
I'm making it short and sweet.

2963
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:01,800
What kind of games are you looking forward to this holiday season?

2964
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:02,800
Hmm.

2965
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:06,680
Well, definitely the WoW nerd in me is excited for Cataclysm.

2966
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:07,680
I think that's a duh.

2967
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:10,560
I think, otherwise, most of them have come out now.

2968
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:13,800
I think Kinect was one of the things I was looking forward to with Dance Central and

2969
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:14,800
all that.

2970
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:15,800
Very interesting.

2971
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:19,720
Civ V was certainly one that I was looking forward to as well, and now that's already

2972
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:20,720
happened.

2973
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:25,160
Otherwise, you know, we're not looking at a lot of big games that I'm interested in

2974
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:31,240
because of the fact that we have the console evolutions, if you will, between the Move

2975
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:35,440
and the Kinect.

2976
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:37,960
As far as the Wii goes, though, sadly, not a lot.

2977
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:40,840
The other thing I'm really looking forward to is the 3DS, and sadly, they didn't make

2978
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:42,840
it for this holiday, but next year.

2979
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:45,080
Will you be playing it?

2980
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:47,880
Because I know you're not really big in handheld games.

2981
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:48,880
You know what?

2982
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:51,080
I'm not, but the 3DS was something else.

2983
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:55,160
The 3DS brings me something that I can't get on my TV.

2984
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:58,480
Do you think just by getting it, you're going to be doing it because...

2985
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:00,840
I'm not sure you said because of the hype, but it's going to be one of those things where

2986
02:26:00,840 --> 02:26:03,960
you're like, oh, I want to play it, and then after you play, you're like, okay, I played

2987
02:26:03,960 --> 02:26:07,720
it, and kind of like Wii and the rest of these systems, and just put it aside, and it's like

2988
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:08,720
this?

2989
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:10,800
Uh, probably.

2990
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:14,960
But there's also that part of me that's kind of like, as a gaming enthusiast, this is definitely

2991
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:17,920
something really new for games.

2992
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:18,920
Well, I guess...

2993
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:22,680
Yeah, I mean, you could say, well, what about Rad Racer and the Virtual Boy?

2994
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:23,680
But I don't know.

2995
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:29,920
Something about the 3DS, I think, is going to really resonate with people the way these

2996
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:32,480
things of the past haven't.

2997
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:36,200
I think just part of it as a gaming fanatic, I kind of owe it to myself to pick one up.

2998
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:37,200
Yeah.

2999
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:40,640
Are you going to pick it up on day one?

3000
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:44,640
Most likely, because if that Kid Icarus game is coming out day one, which I don't see why

3001
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:49,240
it wouldn't be, again, I really have to have that.

3002
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:52,780
Somebody who's loved that game since it was out back in the day.

3003
02:26:52,780 --> 02:26:56,640
Are you afraid possibly the Kid Icarus games are going to turn into the Metroid M?

3004
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:00,800
I haven't played Metroid M. I'm not so sold on the fact that it's as terrible as everyone's

3005
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:03,960
making it out to be, but I'm also a Metroid fanboy.

3006
02:27:03,960 --> 02:27:08,360
Yeah, of course, there's always the possibility the game's going to be terrible.

3007
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:13,480
So I guess I'll weigh some of the early reviews and early impressions, but I don't think that'll

3008
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:15,240
stop me from eventually wanting to pick it up.

3009
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:20,280
I mean, most Nintendo first-party games are still pretty solid.

3010
02:27:20,280 --> 02:27:24,480
It's very rare that Nintendo puts out a first-party stinker.

3011
02:27:24,480 --> 02:27:28,000
Let's not forget Other M isn't a first-party game.

3012
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,800
I mean, it is and it isn't.

3013
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:30,880
You know what I mean?

3014
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:35,240
So most games that Nintendo does in-house themselves are pretty darn good.

3015
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:41,640
I mean, they have made some stinkers and some things that were better on paper than they

3016
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:45,420
were in-game, like Nintendogs.

3017
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:49,720
But Nintendogs also really called out to a certain audience that just wasn't me, you

3018
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:50,720
know?

3019
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:52,720
Little kids love Nintendogs.

3020
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:55,240
And get mauled by them, too, because they're playing them.

3021
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:57,900
Yes, I remember that story from a few weeks ago.

3022
02:27:57,900 --> 02:28:00,920
What about you, XLink, turning around and putting it right back on you?

3023
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:03,240
What are you looking forward to this holiday season?

3024
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:04,240
Too many games.

3025
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:05,240
Too little time.

3026
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:08,640
I have too many on my Steam account to still go through, and then I'm worried about what's

3027
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:12,120
going to happen come this Christmas if Steam does something compared to last year.

3028
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:13,120
Oh, they will.

3029
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:14,120
Absolutely they will.

3030
02:28:14,120 --> 02:28:19,560
And, you know, it's funny because I have Metroid Other M. I haven't got the time since I moved

3031
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:20,560
to set up my Wii.

3032
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:24,120
I just recently set up my Wii, so I'm going to probably sit down this week and play it

3033
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:28,840
for a little while to see how good it is, or see how much of a flop.

3034
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:31,080
But it should be interesting, but I don't.

3035
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:33,680
Anyone in the studio want to chime in on this, the game they're really looking forward to

3036
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:35,680
this holiday?

3037
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:39,520
I'm not really looking forward to a game, actually.

3038
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:42,160
I want to save my money and go to Disneyland.

3039
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,720
There you go.

3040
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:46,480
A lot of other stuff that I wasn't- I want to play in Flynn's Arcade!

3041
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:47,680
Oh, the Tron game!

3042
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:49,080
I'm looking forward to the Tron game.

3043
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:50,080
Yes, yes, yes, the Tron game.

3044
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:51,580
The Tron game does look good.

3045
02:28:51,580 --> 02:28:53,080
It's Prince of Persia with Tron.

3046
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:56,480
Are you very afraid of them dropping the ball on that also?

3047
02:28:56,480 --> 02:29:01,200
That's my biggest concern, is that it looks good, and you see pictures, you see the demos

3048
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:06,360
and stuff, but then when it comes out, it'll be like, what on earth did they do to this?

3049
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:07,360
Excellent.

3050
02:29:07,360 --> 02:29:09,400
Movie tie-in games are almost always terrible.

3051
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:12,880
There are very few movie tie-in games that ever do very well.

3052
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:18,520
GoldenEye is like the biggest exception to a rule in the history of ever.

3053
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:19,520
Like you know what I mean?

3054
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:22,040
But GoldenEye wasn't in the movie, though.

3055
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:24,760
Well, it was later on, but it didn't come out beforehand.

3056
02:29:24,760 --> 02:29:27,520
No, no, that's why Pierce Brosnan was in it.

3057
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:32,400
It was out there to support the movie, and the game was better than the movie.

3058
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:36,480
I mean, that never happens, you know what I mean?

3059
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:43,820
So I think Tron- I don't think Tron is going to be like the, oh my god, face melting-est

3060
02:29:43,820 --> 02:29:48,120
awesome game ever, but I think it will be cool, you know, just even based on what little

3061
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:49,600
bit I played at E3.

3062
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:53,480
I think if they can kind of bring something into the story and sort of bridge the gap

3063
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:56,800
between the two movies, which is what the game is supposed to do, that'll be kind of

3064
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:57,800
neat.

3065
02:29:57,800 --> 02:30:01,640
Yeah, hopefully they'll keep it as much to the movie as possible.

3066
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:07,760
That's what I like to hopefully see in that and play, because I loved Tron growing up

3067
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:09,120
as a kid, when I grew up as a kid.

3068
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:13,160
I saw that and I was totally amazed by the way they did that, and I'm looking forward

3069
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:16,360
for the new one when it comes out, so.

3070
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:21,000
Giovedea in our chatroom brings up another Wii game that we're kind of neglecting here

3071
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
for the holidays.

3072
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Epic Mickey.

3073
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,560
Giovedea says, I want Epic Mickey.

3074
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:28,840
I think that is going to be probably one of the biggest sellers on the Wii this holiday

3075
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:35,700
season, because I think it does a good job of something for hardcore and casual players.

3076
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:39,080
At least for the hardcore who haven't abandoned their Wiis altogether.

3077
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:43,760
And I think at the same time it's a game that kids can play, and they'll be kind of excited

3078
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:44,760
about it.

3079
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:49,040
It's kind of like, this is going to sound weird, but it's kind of like Kingdom Hearts.

3080
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:53,920
Like not the game itself, but just kind of the audience it's going to reach.

3081
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:57,480
It's very Kingdom Hearts.

3082
02:30:57,480 --> 02:30:59,880
And I'm looking forward to the new Donkey Kong.

3083
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:05,440
I really want to see how that lives up to the other ones, so that would be fun, so.

3084
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:06,440
Alright.

3085
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:08,680
Well buddy, we're going to let you go so we can go wrap up the show.

3086
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:10,560
Thank you so much for your call, I appreciate it.

3087
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:11,560
No problem.

3088
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:12,560
I'm going to go fishing, see ya.

3089
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:14,800
You'll be able to play a million games this holiday season.

3090
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:15,800
Yeah, I don't know.

3091
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:16,800
But you better still make great nights.

3092
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:19,640
Between WoW and everything, I don't know how it's going to go, so.

3093
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:21,000
Alright, have a good one buddy.

3094
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Yep, you too.

3095
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:26,040
Alright, that's going to do it for calls tonight, thank you guys so much for trying to call.

3096
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:29,520
For those of you who didn't get through, because we got slammed at the end there, I don't know,

3097
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:32,000
it's so weird how it comes in phases like that.

3098
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,600
Please send us an email, share your thoughts over email, we'd appreciate it.

3099
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:40,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, or what I like to call, Make Jamie Work.

3100
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Anyhow that's good.

3101
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:42,000
What?

3102
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I love you.

3103
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,000
I work plenty.

3104
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I know you do.

3105
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Alright.

3106
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
You're working very hard on your Knights of the Magic Crystals.

3107
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:51,920
I'm not playing it right now.

3108
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:52,920
Right now?

3109
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:53,920
Yeah, because it's all on cooldown.

3110
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:56,420
Yeah, it's all on cooldown, she spent all her points for the hour.

3111
02:31:56,420 --> 02:31:59,160
If the chat room was working for me, I would be in there.

3112
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:02,400
I am messing, slow your roll.

3113
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:03,400
It's going to be okay.

3114
02:32:03,400 --> 02:32:04,400
What?

3115
02:32:04,400 --> 02:32:06,400
903 is when the band was lifted, I looked.

3116
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:07,400
Just so you know.

3117
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:08,400
What?

3118
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:09,400
Oh, 903?

3119
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:10,400
Yeah.

3120
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:13,480
It's going to be interesting because we're about ready to end the show, and, uh, I-

3121
02:32:13,480 --> 02:32:14,480
No FUs tonight!

3122
02:32:14,480 --> 02:32:17,720
Yeah, that we can't do FUs or a cage match, we can't take votes in a cage match.

3123
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:18,720
You can't do-

3124
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:20,440
Well, 903 is only a few minutes away.

3125
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:23,360
Yeah, well, can we stretch for 12 more minutes?

3126
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:24,880
Do you have more last minute stories?

3127
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:28,720
It's not really 12 minutes, it's, I guess it's 12 minutes.

3128
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:32,840
We can indeed still do cage match, Rob, because you tally the votes.

3129
02:32:32,840 --> 02:32:35,440
And I can, I can add some extra windows to that, and it'll help you.

3130
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:37,560
Oh, okay, I was like, I don't know how to do private messages on here.

3131
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:40,320
Okay, if you know how to do it, then we can figure it out.

3132
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:43,340
But I, I still should ask if there's any other last minute stories, because I didn't really

3133
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:45,040
let Loki finish.

3134
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:46,040
Uhhh...

3135
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:47,040
No.

3136
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:50,840
Well, I can talk about some other stuff, I guess.

3137
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:51,840
Sure!

3138
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:52,840
I suppose.

3139
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:53,840
Um...

3140
02:32:53,840 --> 02:33:00,480
The PlayStation 3, there was supposed to be a new jailbreak device that got put out, but,

3141
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:02,600
uh, it was supposed to be a downgrader.

3142
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:07,000
Of course, right now it's kind of in limbo of whether or not that's actually legit or

3143
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
not.

3144
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,280
Um, most people think it's not.

3145
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:15,360
Um, but of course, people have found ways around different protections, including getting

3146
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:20,200
Black Ops to work, so it's kind of fine.

3147
02:33:20,200 --> 02:33:23,560
Um, and then, what else was I going to talk about?

3148
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:28,280
Oh, yeah, Darksiders 2 got announced, and it's supposed to take place alongside, uh,

3149
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:29,280
the original Darksiders series.

3150
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:33,960
I guess they're going to have up to four games, because it's going to be one for each horseman

3151
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:34,960
of the apocalypse.

3152
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:38,640
Because they're saying that there's only one apocalypse, and it wouldn't make sense to

3153
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:41,800
have a sequel to the game.

3154
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:43,600
Final Fantasy always has an apocalypse.

3155
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:49,000
Yeah, but that's Final Fantasy, and, you know, that's just very unrealistic.

3156
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:52,600
Whereas Darksiders, you know, absolutely full of realism.

3157
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:55,880
Aren't video games all supposed to be a little bit unrealistic, unless it's like, I don't

3158
02:33:55,880 --> 02:33:56,880
know, like a sports game?

3159
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:57,880
I'm being sarcastic, bro.

3160
02:33:57,880 --> 02:33:59,360
Oh, oh, oh, my bad.

3161
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:02,360
Yes, you just didn't seem to get it, did you?

3162
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:03,360
Uh...

3163
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:04,360
Story of my life.

3164
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:05,360
Yeah.

3165
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:06,360
Don't agree with that!

3166
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:11,080
I think that was more of a dismissive yeah.

3167
02:34:11,080 --> 02:34:15,360
Um, other fun stuff that we can mention here, we'll just go through all the stories.

3168
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:18,040
Um, Grand Theft Auto trilogy coming out on Macs.

3169
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,080
Wow, that took them a long enough time.

3170
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:26,040
What, I had Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on my old PC laptop that I got back in 05?

3171
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:30,440
Yeah, that took some time there.

3172
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:34,560
Glad to see that they're, uh, on the ball with that stuff.

3173
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:38,360
And then, uh, apparently it was at Crazy Taxis coming out later this month.

3174
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:39,360
That's kind of neat.

3175
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:40,840
Let's make some crazy money!

3176
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:41,840
On Xbox Live Arcade.

3177
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:46,720
Of course it's not going to have all the, uh, wonderful, you know, product placement

3178
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:47,720
in it.

3179
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:48,720
Just have fun.

3180
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:49,720
And all the music.

3181
02:34:49,720 --> 02:34:51,480
All the licensed music is not there anymore.

3182
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:52,920
Oh, darn.

3183
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:53,920
Um...

3184
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:54,920
I love it.

3185
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:56,560
AkumaJP in chat is like, what?

3186
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:59,800
Final Fantasy is real!

3187
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:00,960
Only at anime conventions.

3188
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:01,960
Is it real?

3189
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:03,200
And this is kind of neat.

3190
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:08,080
The tabletop game Zombies apparently is coming to Xbox Live Arcade as well.

3191
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:12,320
And I haven't actually played that tabletop game, but it looks like it might be fun.

3192
02:35:12,320 --> 02:35:14,160
America loves zombies.

3193
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:18,560
It's also, I guess, uh, it might be coming to Windows 7 as well, or Windows Phone 7.

3194
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:21,560
I love Plants vs. Zombies.

3195
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:25,800
Apparently that'll be the first quarter of 2011, and, uh, I guess it was announced three

3196
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:26,800
years ago.

3197
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:27,800
Alright.

3198
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:28,800
Wow.

3199
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:33,080
Um, we still need to go around and give everybody's final thought, so I don't want you to keep

3200
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:34,480
feeling like you have to buy time.

3201
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:37,480
Is that all you want to mention, or are there any other stories that are killing you over

3202
02:35:37,480 --> 02:35:38,480
there?

3203
02:35:38,480 --> 02:35:39,480
Nope, that's it.

3204
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:40,960
You know, we could always just watch the boobie video again.

3205
02:35:40,960 --> 02:35:41,960
I mean, that's all...

3206
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:42,960
No, I'm kidding.

3207
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:46,120
We're gonna go around and give everybody's final thought and wrap up for the night.

3208
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:48,540
We might actually end at midnight Eastern tonight.

3209
02:35:48,540 --> 02:35:49,860
What a change of pace.

3210
02:35:49,860 --> 02:35:52,520
The East Coast listeners will be getting embedded at a decent hour.

3211
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:53,520
Thanks, you guys.

3212
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:56,360
Uh, anyhow, let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts and try to wrap up the show

3213
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:59,440
tonight and, you know, say thanks for listening and all that.

3214
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:00,760
Salacious pulp!

3215
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:03,000
Thank you so much for being here, as always.

3216
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:06,880
And, uh, do you have any final thoughts tonight for our listeners?

3217
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:08,320
No.

3218
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:12,920
He's a man of many words tonight.

3219
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:16,240
All right, uh, Loki, do you have any final thoughts tonight?

3220
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:17,800
Um, not really.

3221
02:36:17,800 --> 02:36:21,480
I'm just gonna try to play more stuff this week and get some more sleep and...

3222
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:23,400
I don't know.

3223
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:25,160
That's all I can do.

3224
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:29,520
My final thought is I'm really gonna try to avoid getting pink eye again, because it sucks.

3225
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:32,160
Darzaka, your final thought?

3226
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:35,240
I'm still getting used to the stuff on my face.

3227
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:36,240
Your hair?

3228
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:37,240
My hair.

3229
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:38,240
My hair's cute.

3230
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:39,240
I have bangs now.

3231
02:36:39,240 --> 02:36:40,240
I like your hair.

3232
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:41,240
It's cute.

3233
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:44,120
All right, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3234
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:46,880
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and supporting us.

3235
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:48,040
We really appreciate it.

3236
02:36:48,040 --> 02:36:51,200
Hey, if you like what you heard tonight, please tell people about our show.

3237
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:52,720
Tell two people about our show.

3238
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:54,060
Help us spread the word.

3239
02:36:54,060 --> 02:36:56,320
Kind reviews on iTunes are always helpful as well.

3240
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:59,520
You know, just anything you can do because, you know, we don't have advertising.

3241
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:01,720
We're not running advertising on the show, you notice, too.

3242
02:37:01,720 --> 02:37:05,240
Uh, it's really the only way we can help spread word of mouth.

3243
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:08,480
And stop asking about me fixing the PSP site.

3244
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:13,200
It literally, I get, like, ten minutes a week to myself to work on stuff, so.

3245
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:14,800
I'd do it if I knew how, but I don't.

3246
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:17,920
Uh, I will need to talk to you about getting the FTP code.

3247
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:20,760
It's been so long since I've actually gone and done anything.

3248
02:37:20,760 --> 02:37:21,760
That I can do.

3249
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:22,760
Yeah, we can work that out.

3250
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:26,120
All right, that's gonna do it anyway, so Loki's aware, folks.

3251
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:27,120
He'll try what he can.

3252
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:28,640
Uh, but yeah, that's it.

3253
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:29,640
We're done.

3254
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:30,880
Thank you guys very much for tuning in.

3255
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:31,880
We'll see you next week.

3256
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:33,640
We'll do this all over again, episode 390.

3257
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:34,640
Oof.

3258
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:36,640
We're almost to 400.

3259
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:37,640
We'll see you next week, guys!

3260
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:41,640
