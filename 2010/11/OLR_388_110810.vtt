00:00.000 --> 00:20.100
Tonight, November 7th, 2010, the new Xbox Connect dashboard is designed for pirates.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.960
Capcom brings Retro Arcade to the iFamily.

00:22.960 --> 00:32.400
And as Microsoft swept indie games under the rug.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.680
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of that video

00:35.680 --> 00:39.520
game talk show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.880
It is episode number 388 of our show.

00:41.880 --> 00:46.200
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura,

00:46.200 --> 00:47.200
Jamie Sommers.

00:47.200 --> 00:51.000
What have you got me on Rob?

00:51.000 --> 00:54.300
It's Knights of the Old Sorority, I was telling you, or whatever this is.

00:54.300 --> 00:58.240
It's Knights of the Crystals on Facebook, but it's just sorority life for the Final

00:58.240 --> 00:59.240
Fantasy characters.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.440
Yeah, I'm gonna stop playing this now.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.800
Oh, you're no fun at all.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.840
I'll play it after the show, I'm being responsible.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.840
You should concentrate on the show.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.840
What do I save?

01:07.840 --> 01:08.840
There will be plenty of time.

01:08.840 --> 01:09.840
You just close it.

01:09.840 --> 01:10.840
It saves as you go.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.940
The internet is a modern miracle.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.120
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.120
Hello.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.120
How are you doing, Loki?

01:17.120 --> 01:18.120
I'm doing fine.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.120
Did you have a good week off, everybody?

01:19.120 --> 01:20.120
Yeah, it was fun.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.120
Yeah.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.120
I didn't have a week off.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.120
Why?

01:23.120 --> 01:24.120
What'd you do?

01:24.120 --> 01:25.120
Recorded another podcast.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.120
Oh, yeah, you had the other show.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.480
Hey, hey, I started a new show, too, so you're not the only one that gets to plug a show

01:29.480 --> 01:30.480
now.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.480
Ha!

01:31.480 --> 01:32.480
Guess what?

01:32.480 --> 01:33.480
What?

01:33.480 --> 01:34.480
We still have a thing to do.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.480
Actually, we only taped a pilot, so we're not really a show yet, because I don't have

01:37.480 --> 01:38.480
a place to host it.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.480
Is it a pilot light?

01:39.480 --> 01:41.320
Yeah, it just means, is the show gonna work or not?

01:41.320 --> 01:42.320
Go for the Frankenstein, please.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.120
Anyway, I'll get into that in a minute.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.960
We'll talk about other side projects in a moment.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.720
I do want to introduce, of course, as always, our fourth guest always here with us, the

01:49.720 --> 01:55.520
chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, live on this Sunday evening as we tape at All Games

01:55.520 --> 01:59.420
Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.960
Every Sunday night is when we tape Orange Lounge Radio.

02:01.960 --> 02:06.160
Anyhow, right after the Bobby Blackwell show, of course, I gotta plug Bobby, because he's

02:06.160 --> 02:07.840
always been there.

02:07.840 --> 02:12.160
He calls himself the opening act, but, you know, I don't see it as a lesser billing.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.720
He's a smart guy, knows a lot about gaming, so tune into his show sometime if you haven't

02:15.720 --> 02:16.720
already.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.000
Anyhow, we're gonna get into How Was Your Gaming Week.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.400
It's always how they start the show.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.000
We are back from a week off.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.520
One week ago was Halloween, so we just decided, you know what, let's just take a weekend off.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.160
There's a lot going on in the real world.

02:29.160 --> 02:33.120
I had a bunch of stuff to do for one of my other hobbies, so we didn't even tape a show.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.520
You know, Logie's got the baby.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.480
Dark Soccer's got, I guess, other podcasts now that are bigger than this little shit

02:38.480 --> 02:39.480
show.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.480
No, I have a big fat hairy cat.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.480
Oh, you do?

02:41.480 --> 02:42.480
Who has a Twitter?

02:42.480 --> 02:43.480
I saw this.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.480
Yeah, Shermy has a Twitter.

02:44.480 --> 02:45.480
When did Shermy get a Twitter?

02:45.480 --> 02:46.480
A few days ago.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.480
Who signed her up for Twitter?

02:47.480 --> 02:48.480
Was that you or was that a fan?

02:48.480 --> 02:49.480
No.

02:49.480 --> 02:50.480
That was me.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.480
Oh, okay.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.400
But she does all the typing, right?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.500
She has me to do it because she's lazy.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.200
It's Shermy O-L-R S-H-E-R-M-I-E O-L-R.

02:59.200 --> 03:03.020
Yes, Shermy has his own, or her own Twitter now.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.520
She twitched when you said his.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.880
I'm sorry, Shermy.

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
Don't poop on me.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.000
It was funny.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.080
This morning when I was recording the other thing, she actually, I put my foot down and

03:12.080 --> 03:18.240
she rolls over and wraps her little stubby legs around my foot and hugs my foot and starts

03:18.240 --> 03:19.240
licking my toe.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.240
Good times.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.640
That's what I have to deal with sitting in that chair.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.640
She doesn't do it to you.

03:24.640 --> 03:25.640
No.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.640
That's because Rob's feet smell.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.120
My feet are smelly.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.520
Let's quickly plug the side projects.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.120
Usually we'll save this for the end of the show because this was brought up a minute

03:32.120 --> 03:33.120
ago.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.960
Dark Soccer, you have a side project called?

03:35.960 --> 03:37.620
Comic Insanity.

03:37.620 --> 03:43.020
It's Insanity without an I in the front of it, so there's only one I and not two.

03:43.020 --> 03:49.200
It's at Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net and we go live on Tuesdays.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.200
Awesome.

03:50.200 --> 03:54.640
And it's just comic books, although today we were without a Mara and Marvel.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.640
Sad.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.560
Yeah, because she has a new house or something.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.560
I don't know.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.560
No.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.560
Hard, hard, hard.

04:00.560 --> 04:07.400
Um, but, uh, but it's me and Tiara, Mara and Marvel and Dan Shadow.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.400
Good times.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.400
Who, we're our group.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.400
Who plays well with me now.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.400
Who plays well with you now.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.400
Yes.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.960
But, uh, I don't play well with you.

04:14.960 --> 04:15.960
Nope.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.760
You're, both Mara and Marvel and Dan Shadow play well with me, but not you.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.760
I'm not a sheep.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.760
That's fine.

04:21.760 --> 04:22.760
That's fine.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.760
Speaking of well.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.760
I play Star Trek.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.560
Speaking of well, that's my new side project.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.280
Xtaphir and I have reunited.

04:28.280 --> 04:32.040
For those that listened to OLR back when it was a station, before the whole merger with

04:32.040 --> 04:35.880
all games some time ago, we were doing a show called Guys on a Show, which is more like

04:35.880 --> 04:38.340
a pop culture thing, but now we do a Warcraft show.

04:38.340 --> 04:41.920
We just did a pilot, so the first episode, the first real episode will go up this week

04:41.920 --> 04:43.840
because there were some problems with the pilot, namely audio.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.680
The audio quality was not that great because of some of the, we don't tape it here in the

04:47.680 --> 04:50.080
OLR studio, we tape it in my house.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.480
So the sound quality was kind of meh.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.360
If you want to get the pilot episode, the only place you can really find it is on my

04:55.360 --> 04:58.200
Twitter and I might have posted it to the OLR Facebook, I don't remember.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.120
If I didn't, I will tonight.

05:00.120 --> 05:03.720
Twitter.com slash SKIE is where you can follow me on Twitter.

05:03.720 --> 05:08.360
And the pilot episode there, the show is called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.040
I think it's very sad that it had to be explained.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.760
Also known as Horde House for sure, or we just, we really call it Horde House because,

05:14.760 --> 05:16.640
but you know, it's funny.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.200
So that's, that's our show.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.200
I love the name.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
Thank you.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.000
It was suggested actually by Mel B, our old pal.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Anyhow, let's uh-

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Who's at Disneyland right now?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.160
I know, bastard.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.780
I've been getting a picture like every three hours from Melody.

05:28.780 --> 05:29.920
I hate her.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
Not really though.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.800
All right, let's talk video games and the games we've been playing this two weeks because

05:33.800 --> 05:34.800
it's been a little while since we did a show.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.800
I guess it says Guys on an MMO.

05:35.800 --> 05:40.680
Guys on an MMO, kind of, kind of, because when DC Universe comes out, I know I want

05:40.680 --> 05:43.960
to check that out and Final Fantasy XIV.

05:43.960 --> 05:44.960
Just kidding.

05:44.960 --> 05:45.960
All right.

05:45.960 --> 05:46.960
DarkShackler, what have you been playing this week?

05:46.960 --> 05:51.880
I did play some Star Trek Online and finally, now that I have a shiny new headset, I've

05:51.880 --> 05:57.720
been able to play on TeamSpeak with my Scottish guild mates, or fleet mates I should say,

05:57.720 --> 06:00.560
and I love listening to Scottish accents a whole lot.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.200
Actually, one of the other guys is I think in Holland and one of the other guys was in

06:04.200 --> 06:05.200
New York.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.040
When we're playing, we have another guy in Hawaii.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.000
There's I think like three or four of us who live in the United States.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.120
The rest all live in the UK and other places in Europe, but it's pretty fun.

06:16.120 --> 06:21.560
I only get to see them when it's like before four here because then it's, you know, close

06:21.560 --> 06:29.880
to midnight there and then I, okay Rob, don't hate.

06:29.880 --> 06:30.880
Don't judge me.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.880
Judging.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.760
Getting ready to judge.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.760
Gavel raised.

06:34.760 --> 06:44.200
I got Second Life so that I could see what the stupid Na'vi universe look like.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.200
Wow.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.960
Well, it's because I, I, you are guilty of nerd-dom.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.480
Oh my God.

06:51.480 --> 06:56.200
Well, I wanted to see, I wanted to, I said, you know, before I actually judged Second

06:56.200 --> 06:59.040
Life, I was going to see what it's like.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.040
That's fair.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.280
I guess you should try something.

07:02.280 --> 07:08.440
And I figured I would go to, instead of dressing up as a big smurf and running around, instead

07:08.440 --> 07:12.960
of doing, you know, I would try to do something that I couldn't really do in another game

07:12.960 --> 07:13.960
online.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.720
Cause I, I kind of, I thought it would be a great idea for them to do like an avatar

07:17.720 --> 07:18.720
MMO.

07:18.720 --> 07:23.760
I guess that thing would be lose all self respect.

07:23.760 --> 07:27.560
And I've only been on it like four times just running around and going, Oh, this is pretty,

07:27.560 --> 07:29.120
Oh, this is pretty.

07:29.120 --> 07:33.480
Second Life controls like shit, just letting you all know.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.640
The chat on there sucks.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.520
Controls like it is.

07:37.520 --> 07:42.440
And I, it was free, okay.

07:42.440 --> 07:47.800
In our chat room, SalaciousPop at chat.orangelandrady.com says, I am jumping in front of Jamie in slow

07:47.800 --> 07:54.480
motion going, no, it's a terrorist bomb counts down to zero.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.820
I mean, get some self respect.

07:57.820 --> 08:04.320
Play a Harry Potter universe if you have to, Rob, I'm just, I'm messing with you.

08:04.320 --> 08:12.840
Well, at any rate, it's, it's not horrible, but after seeing some of the other stuff on

08:12.840 --> 08:14.840
there, I was like, yeah, I don't really have to play this that much.

08:14.840 --> 08:16.440
I've actually got a good game to play.

08:16.440 --> 08:21.440
Um, we got Rock Band 3, so we played a lot of Rock Band 3 since a few days ago.

08:21.440 --> 08:26.480
We actually got it on Halloween, so we've been playing it since then.

08:26.480 --> 08:30.040
Um, I'm trying to think what else, cause I've played a lot of games.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.040
Did you guys get the keyboard?

08:31.040 --> 08:32.040
Yes, we did.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.040
Have you tried it?

08:33.040 --> 08:34.040
I don't like it.

08:34.040 --> 08:37.920
It hurts my hand after a while cause I want to hold the right keyboard position and it

08:37.920 --> 08:38.920
makes my hand hurt.

08:38.920 --> 08:42.240
Oh yeah, cause you had all the, um, surgery issues previously.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.240
And I can't drum.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.240
I can't drum at all.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.240
What do you do?

08:45.240 --> 08:46.240
Sing?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.240
Yeah, pretty much.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.240
And sometimes I'll play guitar.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.240
Okay.

08:49.240 --> 08:53.680
But even that after a while it hurts my hand, but because I, um, I play kind of like bass

08:53.680 --> 08:58.520
style where you pluck up instead of strum down, it doesn't hurt as much.

08:58.520 --> 09:04.480
So um, so I played that, Dan has beaten Fable 3, like within a few days of getting the game.

09:04.480 --> 09:09.640
Um, my, uh, my pro tip to everybody, make sure you have 6 million gold by the time you

09:09.640 --> 09:16.320
actually beat that part of the game, the first, by the time you're the king, or queen, or

09:16.320 --> 09:18.000
whatever you're gonna be.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.440
Um, I love all the voices in that game because, seriously, Jonathan Ross is in it.

09:23.440 --> 09:27.440
Doing announcement when you're beating up, um, monsters, and I love it.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.280
I love Jonathan Ross.

09:30.280 --> 09:35.720
He's the one with the slight speech impediment, where he speaks with the ahs and not the r's.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.160
Um, and, uh, oh.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.680
House Fable 3, like, similar and different.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.080
Simon Pegg does voices in it.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.080
I love him.

09:43.080 --> 09:47.840
House, by the way, somebody, uh, came to Rocky, which was the thing I was doing last week

09:47.840 --> 09:48.840
and not here at the show.

09:48.840 --> 09:52.560
We had a costume contest, the winner was dressed up as Sean from Sean of the Dead, and it was

09:52.560 --> 09:53.640
like A+.

09:53.640 --> 09:54.640
It was perfect.

09:54.640 --> 09:55.640
The guy looked the part and everything.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.640
Oh.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.640
A+.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.640
I would have to glomp on him.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.160
Um, but, you were saying, how does it play?

10:03.160 --> 10:06.600
I was gonna say, how's Fable 3 compared to the last one of Fable 2?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.620
It's got lots of good and lots of bad.

10:08.620 --> 10:13.920
The quest thing, instead of being able to just change your quest and thing, you don't

10:13.920 --> 10:15.240
even have a menu anymore.

10:15.240 --> 10:21.560
You go back to this sanctuary, and, um, and then if you're trying to find a person to

10:21.560 --> 10:25.080
start a particular quest, it doesn't always teleport you right to them.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.400
Oh, Rob's gonna give us diseases.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400
Sorry.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
No.

10:29.400 --> 10:33.440
I have stuff going on, I have to do eye drops every three hours.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.440
Rob's a zombie.

10:34.440 --> 10:35.440
It's time.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.440
Yeah, I'm a zombie.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.440
Brains.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.640
Um, but, no, it's-

10:39.640 --> 10:40.640
Navi!

10:40.640 --> 10:41.640
Shut up.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.560
But, uh, it's not bad.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.320
I mean, there's definitely some, a lot of glitchiness in it, and you know what really

10:48.320 --> 10:54.760
sucks is that when you have to take people places, you can't just tell them to follow

10:54.760 --> 10:55.760
you.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.360
You have to hold their hand and take them with you.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.960
And that's really irritating.

11:00.960 --> 11:07.560
And also, I can see the seam on the dog in the textures, and it's kind of, meh, creepy.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.800
Dogs do have seams, though.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.740
Yeah, but not like that.

11:11.740 --> 11:15.280
Not from the top of their head to the base of their tail.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.280
Sure they do.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.280
No.

11:17.280 --> 11:21.080
He'd be expecting to see stitches or something.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.880
And then there's like a bunch of annoying people.

11:22.880 --> 11:27.780
I love one of the quote bad guys in the game, Reaver.

11:27.780 --> 11:31.520
He's just so ostentatious, I love him.

11:31.520 --> 11:37.520
And he's so evil and such a bastard, I love him to death.

11:37.520 --> 11:42.960
And then I played Robot Unicorn Attack in the middle of Starbucks at 11 o'clock last

11:42.960 --> 11:44.960
night.

11:44.960 --> 11:52.640
And we had one of mine and Dan's friends over beat Little Nemo, the Dream Master, on Nintendo

11:52.640 --> 11:54.320
in our vault last night.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.320
Wow, random.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.440
That game's actually kind of hard, you know?

11:57.440 --> 12:02.240
God, I played a bunch of other stuff, too.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.960
I beat Peggle Knights.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.820
It's actually kind of hard.

12:06.820 --> 12:12.000
It's harder than the first Peggle.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.120
Lots of Plants vs. Zombies, I've almost done growing my tree of life.

12:16.120 --> 12:21.440
Or whatever, the tree of knowledge or whatever the crap the tree is.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.120
Is the tree of worthless advice is what it is.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.440
Okay, then.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.720
Stuff I've already figured out, but you get an achievement for it, so whatever.

12:28.720 --> 12:33.080
And for anyone who has beaten mustache mode, all you have to do is just type mustache while

12:33.080 --> 12:37.440
you're playing and all the zombies will get mustaches and you'll be in mustache mode.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.760
Kay.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.960
I know, it's completely retarded.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.480
I love how stupid that game is.

12:44.480 --> 12:48.040
And I know I played a bunch of stuff this week.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.560
Oh yeah, and I played Dance Masters tonight.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
And I did Pala Pala.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.560
Dancing.

12:53.560 --> 12:58.560
What did you think of Dance Masters on the Xbox Kinect, the other dance game?

12:58.560 --> 13:00.960
I liked Para Para.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.960
I know, that Night of Fire you were doing was just the Para Para dance.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.480
And you were playing on easy mode, so it was less restrictive.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.240
You only had to get like one out of every eight beats right.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.040
I'm imagining the harder levels are like really kinda picky.

13:12.040 --> 13:16.480
I don't know, I think I remembered it pretty well, so I should be able to do it on hard.

13:16.480 --> 13:17.840
You did pretty good for what it looked like.

13:17.840 --> 13:18.840
Yeah.

13:18.840 --> 13:19.840
What did you think of the Kinect as a device?

13:19.840 --> 13:20.840
You were watching Loki and I playing it a little bit.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.480
I thought it was freakin' hilarious.

13:22.480 --> 13:30.400
Especially, okay, they were playing Dance Central and there's like this little solo

13:30.400 --> 13:35.700
freestyle part in it and Rob was going in and shaking his butt and jumping up and down.

13:35.700 --> 13:39.840
And then it plays back in high speed, so you see Rob peeking out, Rob peeking out, Rob's

13:39.840 --> 13:42.280
butt.

13:42.280 --> 13:48.120
And you just see Loki kind of flailing, because he was actually doing stuff, but when it speeds

13:48.120 --> 13:50.640
it up it looks like he's flailing.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.800
Kind of what the Kinect is, it's the Microsoft flail.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.480
Yeah, the Microsoft flail.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.480
Good times.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.480
I like that.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.480
That's what I'm going to call it for now on.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.200
Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

14:00.200 --> 14:01.200
Bam!

14:01.200 --> 14:02.200
Which is what I'm going to take a picture of.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.200
Alright, you do that.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.200
A little Para CD.

14:04.200 --> 14:09.040
No, Dan and I found a bunch of our video game soundtracks, so we've been ripping them, and

14:09.040 --> 14:14.080
I found a VCD of Para Para Panic, volume 2 and 3.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.080
Good times.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.840
I also found a Para Para DVD that belongs to Loki.

14:17.840 --> 14:18.840
Random.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.480
The Para Para Master.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.480
Loki's like, that ain't mine.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.480
Para Para Master?

14:23.480 --> 14:25.800
Yeah, you loaned it to me like five years ago.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.800
I don't even remember that.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.800
Hold on.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.800
Alright.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.800
Okay, everybody else.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.680
Going to the chatroom real quick, Spaznator in our chatroom says, if someone were to put

14:33.680 --> 14:37.680
Abba, our Rocky Horror Picture Show, Dan Central, and Sing Star into a blender, and then puked

14:37.680 --> 14:40.680
out the resulting game, Sky would probably squeal.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.560
Uh, yeah, probably.

14:43.560 --> 14:47.760
Let's see, uh, ssta100matt, this has nothing to do with video games, whatever, we'll entertain

14:47.760 --> 14:48.760
this.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.740
He says, by the way, I want to hear Rob's review on the Glee Rocky Horror Picture Show

14:51.740 --> 14:52.740
episode.

14:52.740 --> 14:58.120
Okay, so ssta100matt wants to hear my review on the Glee Rocky Horror Picture Show episode.

14:58.120 --> 15:04.160
Here you go, it stinks!

15:04.160 --> 15:06.040
It was okay, I guess.

15:06.040 --> 15:10.000
I like the message at the end, but otherwise it's kind of censored and dopey.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Alright.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
What is this?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
It's a kid's bot.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.960
Alright, uh, Loki, you want to talk about- This must have been something I got for free

15:17.960 --> 15:23.800
back when I was wearing VCDs, because I remember this, get VCDs dot com, special price, must

15:23.800 --> 15:24.800
have been free.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.280
Um, yeah, stuff that I- Hi, you're gaming week, yes.

15:28.280 --> 15:32.880
Stuff I played this week, of course I got the Kinect as well, a little bit earlier than

15:32.880 --> 15:37.400
most because I like hunting on eBay sometimes.

15:37.400 --> 15:43.680
Uh, with it came with actually one of the new S systems, so I have a nice new slimmer

15:43.680 --> 15:44.680
system.

15:44.680 --> 15:49.280
Um, so I've been playing a few things, you know, Kinect adventures a little bit, which

15:49.280 --> 15:53.120
is, you know, it's a kind of fun pack-in game, I guess.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.360
You know, pretty basic stuff on there.

15:55.360 --> 16:01.280
Um, I started off playing some of the demos for Joyride and Dance Central, and really

16:01.280 --> 16:05.720
the demo for Dance Central, which is on the disc, so, um, you know, if they put it on

16:05.720 --> 16:10.360
Xbox Live Marketplace, you don't really need to download it because it's already on the

16:10.360 --> 16:11.360
disc.

16:11.360 --> 16:18.040
Um, it's only got two songs on the demo, which were, um, Poker Face by Lady Gaga and Poison.

16:18.040 --> 16:25.280
Um, Poison is a lot more difficult than Poker Face, that's for sure, because I'm like,

16:25.280 --> 16:29.760
okay, Poker Face, that was really easy, I'm gonna go in the Poison, and it's like, okay,

16:29.760 --> 16:31.520
break it down, do this.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.320
I'm like, I can't do that.

16:34.320 --> 16:39.560
You know, some 90s dance moves and stuff, but I think actually if you play through,

16:39.560 --> 16:44.720
um, Dance Central, through the songs in the actual order that they're in there, uh, from

16:44.720 --> 16:48.240
easiest to hardest, I think it'd be a lot easier to pick up some of the stuff, because

16:48.240 --> 16:53.920
some of the moves are just, it's a little tough for me to wrap my brain around it.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.680
Um, but yeah, it's a fun game.

16:55.680 --> 17:01.400
Um, played Dance Masters a little bit, um, or I should say I watched Dance Masters a

17:01.400 --> 17:05.680
little bit, because the thing that's really frustrating about that game, although I have

17:05.680 --> 17:12.240
to say I didn't try the lesson modes, so maybe that breaks it down a little bit more, but

17:12.240 --> 17:15.520
it basically says, okay, go.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.440
And then it starts doing stuff and you start messing up because you don't know what the

17:18.440 --> 17:23.960
hell you're supposed to be doing, and that's it, and you just act confused, unless of course

17:23.960 --> 17:28.440
you've played lots of Para Para, and you know some of the Para Para dances, in which case,

17:28.440 --> 17:32.720
there's at least four songs you'll be able to do just fine, um, but the rest of them

17:32.720 --> 17:35.400
are just very confusing.

17:35.400 --> 17:41.160
A lot of songs from DDR, a ton of songs from DDR, um, everything from, you know, the Para

17:41.160 --> 17:49.680
Para songs to, uh, Sakura, Exotic Ethnic, uh, Let the Beat Hit Em, um, Keep on Movin',

17:49.680 --> 17:56.040
um, Higher, I'm trying to think of some of the other songs that were in there, um, but

17:56.040 --> 18:02.240
yeah, a lot of DDR stuff, and honestly, as Rob was saying when, um, he was actually looking

18:02.240 --> 18:05.360
at the game, the game looks a lot better than Dance Central.

18:05.360 --> 18:10.440
Yeah, I was surprised, Dance Masters is actually like a better looking game than Dance Central,

18:10.440 --> 18:15.440
like it, just the inter-, it, the way you watch it play out is a lot cooler than those

18:15.440 --> 18:17.400
little like flashcards going up the side.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.020
I think the flashcards going up the side makes the dance like impracticality, like you said,

18:21.020 --> 18:24.280
it's easier to learn that way, whereas it's just kind of like throw it in and do it, but

18:24.280 --> 18:26.880
like if you're just kind of like trying to show off the poses and stuff, I think with

18:26.880 --> 18:31.000
like the silhouettes collapsing in and the rings that show up, I think the game looks

18:31.000 --> 18:35.600
awesome, and like I think if you were to like pull it off the way you're supposed to, which,

18:35.600 --> 18:38.280
I know some folks might be surprised, they were expecting me to come on here and say

18:38.280 --> 18:42.640
Dance Masters is full of fail, but there's some interesting parts in there, like I think

18:42.640 --> 18:46.520
that the interface itself is pretty sleek when you're playing the game, I like the look

18:46.520 --> 18:47.520
a lot.

18:47.520 --> 18:52.120
It's interesting, you know, as far as like some of the songs that are in there and stuff,

18:52.120 --> 18:56.440
because I think it'd be fun to see what the routines are for them, um, obviously, and

18:56.440 --> 19:01.440
this goes for both games, there are some songs like, for example, Poker Face and stuff that

19:01.440 --> 19:06.960
I would feel like an idiot doing, you know, in real life versus, you know, some of the

19:06.960 --> 19:11.040
songs, you know, like Poison and stuff that have really good dance steps to them, I mean

19:11.040 --> 19:14.960
obviously they have the simple, you know, have some simple songs in there so you can

19:14.960 --> 19:19.120
learn, because, you know, a lot of it is like, oh, I could do that, but it's actually really

19:19.120 --> 19:22.160
hard sometimes to figure out what they want you to do, and you have to kind of do it a

19:22.160 --> 19:27.280
few times to be able to understand what you need to do in the game, but, Dance Masters,

19:27.280 --> 19:31.340
the other thing I don't like about Dance Masters is the actual menus, the way they have you

19:31.340 --> 19:36.160
navigate it is not very intuitive, and a lot of times they end up selecting things they

19:36.160 --> 19:41.520
didn't want to select, um, was it Dance Central? No, Dance Masters, I have problems with Dance

19:41.520 --> 19:45.360
Central, I don't know if that's just the Kinect device itself, but, like, trying to select

19:45.360 --> 19:51.440
a song is a pain in the ass sometimes on Dance Central, yeah, um, the thing with Dance Central

19:51.440 --> 19:55.120
though is you can actually use the controller to select stuff if you want to, oh, didn't

19:55.120 --> 20:00.560
even try it, derp derp, um, so that's kind of neat, um, and then other things, can I

20:00.560 --> 20:03.520
say this real quick though about Dance Central, some of those moves are kind of embarrassing

20:03.520 --> 20:06.920
too, this is Dance Central, again, we've been kind of going back and forth between the Dance

20:06.920 --> 20:11.520
Masters, yeah, they are, here's the easiest way to remember, Dance Central has real songs,

20:11.520 --> 20:17.440
Dance Masters has DDR songs, like, which, you know, I realize some people consider them

20:17.440 --> 20:22.240
real songs, I don't mean to, you know, spit in the eye of what we grew up on, but it's

20:22.240 --> 20:27.160
not music you're gonna hear out in the real world, if you're a fan of DDR, and you know,

20:27.160 --> 20:30.160
you buy Dance Masters, you probably think, oh, originally you're like, okay, well I know

20:30.160 --> 20:34.540
Para stuff is gonna be in there, and you think, oh, it's just all Para Para dancing, well,

20:34.540 --> 20:38.480
they have, like, a lot of songs from DDR, and it was kind of cool to see a lot of stuff

20:38.480 --> 20:43.320
on there, but there's really only a couple songs that weren't in DDR, or at least I didn't

20:43.320 --> 20:48.800
recognize in DDR. I think though, those of you guys that, like, grew up on DDR, and have

20:48.800 --> 20:53.160
been playing for years and years, ever logged into, if you had an account on DDR Freak at

20:53.160 --> 20:58.420
any point in time, go buy Dance Masters, the rest of you, get Dance Central, that's, that's

20:58.420 --> 21:04.280
really how it kind of breaks down. Dance Central I like because I've, long time ago, I actually

21:04.280 --> 21:09.080
took a dance class, and the way they teach you how to do the different routines is the

21:09.080 --> 21:14.560
way you would learn it in a dance class, which is kind of cool, so I enjoy that game a lot

21:14.560 --> 21:18.680
more because it actually, you get an idea of what you're supposed to do, even though

21:18.680 --> 21:21.860
they do have the flashcards, if that's not for you, if you just wanna, you know, you

21:21.860 --> 21:27.060
know the routine, you just wanna do it, you can turn those flashcards off. Anybody who's

21:27.060 --> 21:32.120
ever loved Para Para Paradise or even liked it, you need to get Dance Masters, because

21:32.120 --> 21:36.100
it basically is Para Para Paradise under a different name, and just a different gameplay

21:36.100 --> 21:41.800
mechanic, but like, the Night of Fire dance is the same dance. Yes, it is. You know, so,

21:41.800 --> 21:44.800
it's something, remember, like way back in the day, I was like, hey, know what'd be kind

21:44.800 --> 21:49.000
of cool is if they had a Para game with like, you know, different genres of music in there,

21:49.000 --> 21:54.280
not just Para Para, that's Dance Masters, it's basically, funny, you know. Let me go

21:54.280 --> 21:57.000
back to Dance Central for a minute, because Loki was talking about some of the embarrassing

21:57.000 --> 22:00.040
dance moves that happened in that game, and I'll tell you, I don't know if you've, have

22:00.040 --> 22:04.240
you played, you haven't really played the demo, outside the demo, huh? Not too much,

22:04.240 --> 22:08.200
no. Okay, I was playing the full version, I was playing, there's a song by M.I.A. called

22:08.200 --> 22:11.120
Galang, and I don't know if you've ever heard this song, but let me play a little bit of

22:11.120 --> 22:17.320
it for listeners here in, listening to this song. This is an awesome song, yeah, I really

22:17.320 --> 22:24.320
like this song, but like, the way you dance to this song, is like, you like, hop, bend

22:24.320 --> 22:28.840
over, shake your butt, it's like, like the dance you're doing is like, really embarrassing,

22:28.840 --> 22:34.360
but, it's kinda, I, when it all comes together, I think it looks pretty cool. Dance Masters,

22:34.360 --> 22:38.080
supposedly, and I haven't actually checked it out yet, I think there's a way that you

22:38.080 --> 22:43.320
can actually customize, like, the dances in there, like you can create your own, like

22:43.320 --> 22:48.680
an edit mode almost. Dance Central? Dance Masters. Oh, I can't tell them apart! Dance

22:48.680 --> 22:52.280
Central, I'm surprised that they didn't have that, because they have all the moves broken

22:52.280 --> 22:56.400
down, you should be able to just order them in a way, you know, to create a routine, and

22:56.400 --> 23:02.480
it wouldn't be that difficult for the actual on-screen dancers to follow it. Dance Central

23:02.480 --> 23:08.440
is very much a first game, as is Dance Masters. I mean, you have to go, okay, Dance Central

23:08.440 --> 23:14.880
is like the first Guitar Hero game, which led to Guitar Hero 2, which led to Rock Band

23:14.880 --> 23:19.120
and Guitar Hero 3, which led to, you know, where we're at now with, like, Rock Band 3.

23:19.120 --> 23:23.320
So the potential is there for something really cool, but this first game is definitely like

23:23.320 --> 23:29.000
a bare bones thing, but it'll, it'll be a hit at parties. Either one will be, really.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.960
It'll be pretty fun. Other things I played, Connect Joyride, which I enjoyed, you know,

23:35.960 --> 23:40.520
some people have trouble controlling the game, but I actually had no problems with it, and

23:40.520 --> 23:43.320
I actually thought it was pretty fun, and I played the demo that was on the disc and

23:43.320 --> 23:48.800
I ended up buying it. A couple reasons why I bought it, one, because it looked fun, and

23:48.800 --> 23:54.200
two, it was one of the games I was able to get early. And then also Connect Sports, which

23:54.200 --> 23:59.160
I actually haven't touched yet, so I can't really give any impressions on. I do still

23:59.160 --> 24:06.200
want to get possibly yourself fitness, or your shape fitness, or whatever the hell it's

24:06.200 --> 24:10.960
called, just to try that out, because right now, I mean, I can't get out to the gym even

24:10.960 --> 24:14.760
if I wanted to. There's just no time of the day, and I think it would be nice to have

24:14.760 --> 24:19.840
some sort of exercise program, and honestly, I would prefer getting the EA Sports Active

24:19.840 --> 24:25.920
2.0 one, because it looks like it's a lot more structured. They actually have a nine

24:25.920 --> 24:30.840
week program you can go through, and a bunch of neat features for that. The problem is

24:30.840 --> 24:37.240
it's 100 bucks, and I really don't want to spend $100 on a game, even if it does work

24:37.240 --> 24:43.560
out pretty well, but I don't know. It would be neat to just try that stuff, because it

24:43.560 --> 24:48.320
looks like that might work pretty well. But yeah, I'm looking forward to more stuff. Hopefully

24:48.320 --> 24:52.880
they actually start having indie games, and Xbox Live Arcade games that support Connect

24:52.880 --> 24:57.680
stuff, and hopefully we get into some more different types of games other than stuff.

24:57.680 --> 25:01.000
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing the different genres, you know? Okay, because

25:01.000 --> 25:08.760
all the games that are launched are like dance, fitness, interpretations of Wii games from

25:08.760 --> 25:14.880
their launch party, but we have yet to see how is Connect going to affect Gears of War,

25:14.880 --> 25:19.480
if at all. Like, I'm not, please hear me out, I'm not saying every game needs to have Connect

25:19.480 --> 25:23.760
shoved in it. In fact, that would make me very disappointed. But I'm saying like a Gears

25:23.760 --> 25:27.480
of War-esque kind of series that uses Connect. And I don't think you need to go too crazy

25:27.480 --> 25:31.200
with some of that stuff. I think it would be neat to have a game where you play it on

25:31.200 --> 25:36.640
the couch, it just supports Connect, but you're still using the controller. Say for example,

25:36.640 --> 25:42.120
you're peeking around a corner or something, you just lean with your controller in hand,

25:42.120 --> 25:46.160
you lean to the side and your character peeks around the corner instead of you having to

25:46.160 --> 25:52.160
hit a button or something like that. Just really, you know, subtle stuff. I don't think

25:52.160 --> 25:57.080
you need to actually flail around or something, but I think adding a little bit of extra stuff,

25:57.080 --> 26:03.360
you know, or maybe like voice commands to different things might be kind of neat. Just

26:03.360 --> 26:10.280
do it tastefully, you know? Don't have like, Halo Connect, you know? And something you

26:10.280 --> 26:13.080
touched on a little bit there that I wanted to definitely mention and expand on a little

26:13.080 --> 26:17.560
bit is the more minority report style stuff that's in the Xbox Connect, meaning that it

26:17.560 --> 26:22.640
will identify your face and sign you in. If you have to calibrate, you have to go through

26:22.640 --> 26:28.320
this somewhat extensive calibration in Connect ID, and for it to work really well, you have

26:28.320 --> 26:31.680
to do it like in the daytime, in the nighttime, with all your lights on, with some of your

26:31.680 --> 26:36.040
lights on, you have to do it a few times. But if you do, then when you go into the Connect

26:36.040 --> 26:42.040
Hub, which you can do just by yelling at your Xbox, Xbox, Connect, and it will go into the

26:42.040 --> 26:45.640
Connect Hub. And if it can see your face, it will scan and it will go, oh, hey, Rob,

26:45.640 --> 26:48.680
what you doing? You know, not really like that, but you know, it'll, it'll, hey, Rob,

26:48.680 --> 26:52.920
what you doing? Hey, girl, what it do? No, it's not going to do that, okay? It's just

26:52.920 --> 26:58.560
like, but it'll, I will not have to pick up a controller at all. In fact, I have gone

26:58.560 --> 27:05.040
so far as to eject the game, put in the new game, walk away, and then it'll go Xbox, Connect,

27:05.040 --> 27:10.760
close tray. And it knows who I am, starts, and closes the tray. I mean, it's, it's kind

27:10.760 --> 27:15.280
of scary in some regards, but neat. I want to see that expanded on though, because it's

27:15.280 --> 27:19.160
very limited right now. There's only very certain commands. Like, you can't be like

27:19.160 --> 27:23.480
Xbox, paint my house. You know, it's not going to, it's not going to know how to do anything

27:23.480 --> 27:30.000
but like close the tray and go to your friends list, you know? And then also, you know, like,

27:30.000 --> 27:34.840
the fact that actually those voice commands work with pretty much anybody. You know, my

27:34.840 --> 27:38.720
wife is like, you know, yelling stuff out. She's like, haha, I can hear fear through

27:38.720 --> 27:43.520
your stuff without having to steal your controller. I can run in front of you and the game detects

27:43.520 --> 27:48.520
me and it'll screw up your game. Haha. I heard though, it doesn't see people behind you.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.680
It doesn't see people behind me. She runs in front of me. Oh, okay. And it sometimes

27:51.680 --> 27:56.400
does that and sometimes it, sometimes it won't even get confused at all. It's just, it's

27:56.400 --> 28:01.920
really interesting. The other thing, completely unrelated to actually playing Connect games,

28:01.920 --> 28:07.000
which this isn't really a feature for a lot of people, but for me, since I have an infant

28:07.000 --> 28:12.720
it is, the nice little calibration cards that come with a lot of the games that are high

28:12.720 --> 28:16.520
contrast, black and white, it's a little... What do they do? It's for calibrating the

28:16.520 --> 28:19.800
system. I have yet to use them. Well, you can use it to calibrate the system. It takes,

28:19.800 --> 28:24.000
it's a little smiley face and it says, you know, place this so that the glasses are on

28:24.000 --> 28:28.440
the smiley face and you see, you move it back and forth and it calibrates the sensor that,

28:28.440 --> 28:32.320
you know, get distance or whatever you're running. Where is that? What do you, in the

28:32.320 --> 28:37.480
dashboard? Uh, and then the little connect dashboard thing. I've done it once. Anyways,

28:37.480 --> 28:43.560
but that's not the point. The point is my son loves staring at that thing and just like

28:43.560 --> 28:50.560
plays with it and just like, and smiling is so happy, is literally his favorite toy. Loki,

28:50.560 --> 28:54.640
I'm just saying you could go get like a little piece of cardboard at Target for like 10 cents

28:54.640 --> 28:58.960
and a Sharpie marker. You can make a million of those. Oh, I know that, but I'm just saying

28:58.960 --> 29:03.880
it's, it's an added bonus because they, they come with a bunch of them. Cause I, I got

29:03.880 --> 29:07.680
it and you know, with it and says, do not throw this away. I'm like, the hell is this?

29:07.680 --> 29:11.640
Um, so you know, do I have to hold this in front of the camera? And Bobby Blackwolf in

29:11.640 --> 29:14.560
our chat room is, is echoing you. It's in the connect tuner on the connect hub. I thought

29:14.560 --> 29:18.480
I went through that setup. So there's a whole nother calibration. There's another calibration

29:18.480 --> 29:23.600
set up. There's a lot of calibrating to do with this, but it's been working fine without

29:23.600 --> 29:26.480
all that fine calibration except the fact that I live in a tiny apartment and don't

29:26.480 --> 29:29.840
have a lot of space. Yeah. That only means that you can't play connected ventures to

29:29.840 --> 29:34.120
player because it requires not going to have feet, you know, or whatever in order to play

29:34.120 --> 29:37.880
two players on that. A lot of the other games don't do, you know, really give a crap. In

29:37.880 --> 29:41.280
fact, you know, I'd say, you know, Jamie's living room here. That mean that was maybe

29:41.280 --> 29:46.160
like six feet. Yeah, it worked. If that it was just fine. I had no problem with it. Just

29:46.160 --> 29:50.400
a little para para. Yeah. It's just connected ventures I think is really, I don't even know

29:50.400 --> 29:55.160
if it necessarily needs that. It's just that they don't want you smacking into each other.

29:55.160 --> 30:00.400
Yeah. Have you done the video chat at all? No, it's really creepy. Try it because the

30:00.400 --> 30:04.300
connect will follow you around. Like I was sitting in the chair, like I wasn't actually

30:04.300 --> 30:07.240
chatting with anyone, but you can see your window. And then like if I, if I stand up,

30:07.240 --> 30:11.240
like the connect follows me and if I kind of move it, like it follows you around, which

30:11.240 --> 30:15.280
is kind of creepy. You can only move up and down, right? Yeah. But well it also will zoom

30:15.280 --> 30:19.440
in and pan left and right as it zooms it. Like it's zooming in on your face. Yeah. It's

30:19.440 --> 30:23.960
kind of, kind of creepster, but cool. I liked it. I'm going to chat room and some comments

30:23.960 --> 30:29.600
at chat.orangelandtrady.com. Um, Oh yes. Marissa con gusto in our chair and says, I do not

30:29.600 --> 30:32.960
want a system that hits on me or notices if I have gained weight. Oh, that would be a

30:32.960 --> 30:39.480
terrible wouldn't it? You know, X-Box connect. Hi Rob. Oh, you might want to stop eating

30:39.480 --> 30:43.040
donuts. I thought they were having a feature or there was something, maybe it was in the

30:43.040 --> 30:47.920
one of those, like, you know, here's what it possibly can do, you know, or I'm scanning

30:47.920 --> 30:54.000
my skateboard and that bullcrap. Um, where like it could scan your image and it makes

30:54.000 --> 30:57.660
an avatar character out of that. Well, what's also going to be interesting is what future

30:57.660 --> 31:01.560
firmware updates will do because the technology is there now. Now it's about really kind of

31:01.560 --> 31:06.400
squeezing out the potential of it. I'm kind of curious to see what next year's update

31:06.400 --> 31:10.800
will bring because probably more of this stuff. Browsing, it won't probably be just like you'll

31:10.800 --> 31:15.340
be able to browse the marketplace or something like that. Dance masters fact sheet. Apparently

31:15.340 --> 31:20.040
there is a lesson mode. Yeah, that would be nice because stepping right into the dance

31:20.040 --> 31:24.860
mode is like, huh? Yeah. All right. Anything else for your gaming week? Um, yeah. Other

31:24.860 --> 31:31.560
than X-Box and connect stuff, um, well actually I played rock band three briefly. I just got

31:31.560 --> 31:36.880
around to it. So one of my systems actually died on me and I had it fixed. So, um, that

31:36.880 --> 31:43.380
was nice. And, um, I played, well, I spent a lot of the time just recreating my band,

31:43.380 --> 31:49.440
the uh, what was it? Unfit barf bags because that was the random, that was the random band

31:49.440 --> 31:54.640
name he gave me in rock band two. And so I just stuck with it and it was funny. Um, actually

31:54.640 --> 31:58.160
they had something about like, it was one of the first random names he gave me. It was

31:58.160 --> 32:03.000
like talking about parakeets or something like that. I thought that was fancy. Ah, that

32:03.000 --> 32:09.300
is a close second there. Good name. Just talk about parakeets. Uh, but anyways, so I ended

32:09.300 --> 32:13.680
up playing, um, you know, the power of love on, um, the keyboards because I had to try

32:13.680 --> 32:17.900
that out and it was awesome. Um, and then, okay, then other than was relatively easy

32:17.900 --> 32:22.380
for keyboard though. Yeah. And I, of course I didn't bother doing keyboards in normal

32:22.380 --> 32:26.200
mode because that's just retarded with the five keys. Um, I stuck with the pro mode and

32:26.200 --> 32:29.560
just, you know, stick with easy. Well, if you actually want to be able to play things

32:29.560 --> 32:33.880
like Bohemian Rhapsody, you got to do five key. Well, why can't you just play it on easy?

32:33.880 --> 32:37.460
Oh, okay. Yeah, you can do it on easy. I mean, you can do easy in promo that I think that's

32:37.460 --> 32:42.840
the way to do it. Um, but I've done a little bit of both. Like I can, I can actually be

32:42.840 --> 32:47.120
just like heaven and imagine on like expert pro keys, but it took a little while to kind

32:47.120 --> 32:52.000
of get there, but it's cool that I can do it after practicing. I had problems with,

32:52.000 --> 32:57.640
you know, um, lining up my hands because you know, it like for example, the power of love

32:57.640 --> 33:02.360
is more on the right side of the keyboard. And so I see stuff come down the center of

33:02.360 --> 33:07.080
the screen. I'm thinking, Oh, hand in the center of the keyboard and it would be lined

33:07.080 --> 33:11.360
up normally like if I was playing keyboard mania or something like that. But I had my

33:11.360 --> 33:16.940
hands too far to the left. So other than that, other than Grand Theft Auto, um, some iPod

33:16.940 --> 33:22.840
games have been playing or iOS games, I guess, um, mainly stick wars, which I mentioned was

33:22.840 --> 33:27.720
kind of a rip off of the game defender castle. It's basically a game where you flick a stick

33:27.720 --> 33:32.280
figures up in the air and kill them. And, uh, kind of a tower defense game. And of course

33:32.280 --> 33:36.600
the other tower defense game also involving stick figures I've been playing was, um, cartoon

33:36.600 --> 33:45.040
wars two, uh, tried that, tried a little bit of Sonic for episode one on the iPod. And,

33:45.040 --> 33:53.040
uh, it's terrible as I figured it would be. Thankfully I didn't buy it. Um, and what else?

33:53.040 --> 34:00.160
Um, Oh yeah. A little bit of a space invaders, uh, infinity gene, which I love that game.

34:00.160 --> 34:06.200
It's pretty awesome. Um, that's pretty much it. Okay. We, I know we've been on the gaming

34:06.200 --> 34:09.840
weeks for a while. Let me talk quickly, but we had a connect launch this week and a few

34:09.840 --> 34:14.600
of us played it. Um, I had some, uh, stuff going on where I wasn't able to leave the

34:14.600 --> 34:17.880
house this weekend. Long story. I don't want to get into it. Um, but I bought a connect

34:17.880 --> 34:21.000
to hold me over. So I've been playing a lot of the same stuff we've already talked about

34:21.000 --> 34:26.300
dance central, um, which is fine, but I, the interface bugs me like it doesn't control

34:26.300 --> 34:29.840
very well, but now that I know about this extra calibration stuff, maybe I need to try

34:29.840 --> 34:33.800
that. So now that I know and knowing is half the battle, um, I'll, I'll try that a little

34:33.800 --> 34:37.480
more. But otherwise, like the dancers are kind of fun and it's a pretty good workout.

34:37.480 --> 34:41.560
And that's, that's the best thing about connect is that it's a, it's a good calorie counter

34:41.560 --> 34:46.520
for that. I noticed. Yeah. Oh yeah. I turned it on. It's, it's a good, um, the photo modes

34:46.520 --> 34:50.760
a little creepy. I think I might need to turn that off cause I'm like, I don't like being

34:50.760 --> 34:55.760
required to wear pants to play Xbox. You know what the connect adventures stuff, you know

34:55.760 --> 35:01.200
how there's that connect share.com website. Yeah. Like I'm afraid that one day I'm going

35:01.200 --> 35:04.360
to be sitting there playing with no pants on cause you know, look, it's the privacy

35:04.360 --> 35:08.600
of my own house. Come on guys. You know, pants are restrictive. So sometimes you'd like to

35:08.600 --> 35:14.400
play with no pants. So I was playing in my pajamas. Yeah. That's what I'll do now because

35:14.400 --> 35:18.400
I am like deathly afraid that the machine is going to take a picture of me and like

35:18.400 --> 35:22.760
upload it to my Facebook without me knowing. And I, I realized this is a totally irrational

35:22.760 --> 35:27.020
fear and like, yes, these modes can be turned off, but come on. Like it's, it's like this,

35:27.020 --> 35:32.160
this part of technology kind of freaks me out or it's like suddenly, you know, everybody's

35:32.160 --> 35:36.960
going to know if it's boxers, boxers or briefs, you know, and I don't, there's certain things

35:36.960 --> 35:40.560
that my Facebook friends do not need to know about and what color I'm wearing today is

35:40.560 --> 35:50.400
one of them. You know what I mean? Yeah. So anyhow, I don't want people to see my completely

35:50.400 --> 35:54.400
mismatched and way too big for me. Pajamas. That's like, that's, you know what, it's the

35:54.400 --> 35:59.680
equivalent guys with pants are like women with bras. Like most women I talk to are like,

35:59.680 --> 36:07.280
first thing I do when I get home, bras off. Well, and you don't want your connect. Take

36:07.280 --> 36:14.480
a picture as you're jumping up and down and some of the jumblies going jumble, jumble,

36:14.480 --> 36:19.580
jumble. Uh, look, look, look, I, I swear I didn't even look at you. I hear Jessica Harper's

36:19.580 --> 36:23.360
in our chat tonight. Hell, I'd play braless. Well, I call it, did I call it or did I call

36:23.360 --> 36:28.640
it? Thank you very much. I did after Loki was setting up the connectors I went in and

36:28.640 --> 36:35.240
put on a sports bra because I didn't want to kill myself. Thank you. Jessica's backing

36:35.240 --> 36:40.280
me up here. My house is a bra free zone. 100%. There you go. Uh, kitsune says, I don't want

36:40.280 --> 36:43.320
people to see me in my undies, so I got to make sure I wear pants. That's, that's the

36:43.320 --> 36:49.240
same completely irrational fear that I have. Like with this technology, the way it is like,

36:49.240 --> 36:54.040
I need something in the intro to the game to assure me, hi Rob, I promise I won't take

36:54.040 --> 36:57.720
pictures of you with no pants on. Then we'll be fine. Like as long as the connect and I

36:57.720 --> 37:02.080
have that mutual understanding that we're not taking pictures, I'll be fine. Rob, but

37:02.080 --> 37:07.480
we could have pencils rage. Rob. Now remember now, here's something to be afraid of, I guess.

37:07.480 --> 37:11.360
Well, in fact, actually, I guess it doesn't really shine too much of a spot. Remember

37:11.360 --> 37:16.440
those, uh, I think there were Sony cameras actually that had an infrared filter mode

37:16.440 --> 37:21.000
or something like that, and people were using them to see through people's clothes. It might

37:21.000 --> 37:27.440
not matter with the connect camera. They will, it will be undressing you with its lenses.

37:27.440 --> 37:33.400
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, to be fair, connect share.com only shows your own photos or videos

37:33.400 --> 37:38.360
that you upload from the game. You can't find anyone else's stuff. I, I, I just don't trust.

37:38.360 --> 37:43.920
There's hackers out there, Bobby. They're hacking everyone on out here. You know, your

37:43.920 --> 37:48.440
pants hide your bras. I want though with the connect, the fact that it shoots, you know,

37:48.440 --> 37:52.960
infrared lights, you know, in a really neat, uh, you know, pattern across the room. I want

37:52.960 --> 37:56.480
a laser light show. Damn it. Because it's already doing that. I want it so that I can

37:56.480 --> 38:00.320
see it. Yes. The Michael Jackson game that's coming out should do a Michael Jackson laser

38:00.320 --> 38:05.000
shows. Like the one I saw in Seattle last year. Um, am I the only one that feels like

38:05.000 --> 38:08.280
I should not look directly into the connect? Cause there's that little red light that looks

38:08.280 --> 38:12.280
like a laser, which I'm sure is the infrared. It is a laser. Oh my God. Have you ever caught

38:12.280 --> 38:17.040
yourself staring right into it going, this isn't a good idea. Yes. Because it's like

38:17.040 --> 38:24.000
the mind control device. It's like, wait a second. I recognize that red in your eye.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.680
Your terminator sent back from the future to kill me. Oh, look what I started in chat

38:29.680 --> 38:34.560
chat that orange on show.com satellite minded the climate in your windows. They're snatching

38:34.560 --> 38:46.500
your pictures up. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Anyhow, moving on. Oh yes.

38:46.500 --> 38:49.880
Other things I played this week. Let's see. I also played rock band three. You know, I

38:49.880 --> 38:52.960
loves me some keyboards. My least favorite thing about rock band three is that there's

38:52.960 --> 38:57.160
not enough songs to play with the keyboards because I have like 300 songs in my library

38:57.160 --> 39:00.680
now, thanks to rock band one, rock band two, all the download stuff, which is a really

39:00.680 --> 39:05.320
obscene amount. I really hope they go back soon and add the key support. Yes, I know

39:05.320 --> 39:09.200
it's supposed to be coming, so I'll stop bitching, but that's the only thing that bugs me about

39:09.200 --> 39:13.840
it. Otherwise, I think it's a fantastic upgrade. Uh, and if you own rock band two or rock band

39:13.840 --> 39:17.960
one, drop the extra money, drop the 50, 60 bucks and get this. The whole dropping in

39:17.960 --> 39:22.280
and out will be great for parties. I think the song select mode and being able to filter

39:22.280 --> 39:26.120
stuff is so much more intuitive. I think they really have learned. They have just created

39:26.120 --> 39:29.400
an incredible music game and it really makes me go the hell are we going to get in rock

39:29.400 --> 39:35.080
band four and the sorting is already blowing my mind. Oh, the sorting is outstanding. Outstanding.

39:35.080 --> 39:39.840
Um, real quick, just because it does kind of tie into the whole connect thing. What

39:39.840 --> 39:46.940
do you think of the new dashboard? Um, it's not that different from the old one, although

39:46.940 --> 39:52.920
how much have they tried to kind of emulate the Wii and right on down to the whole little

39:52.920 --> 40:04.640
like little like background noises that you hear when you're in the, you know, kind of

40:04.640 --> 40:09.480
what it sounds like when you're in the menus and just and all the cuteness and the, the,

40:09.480 --> 40:15.360
it, it, how I don't like how white it has been inspired from a Nintendo. You got a problem

40:15.360 --> 40:21.160
with white things? Yes, I do. Oh, sorry to hear that. Well, I don't know what to tell

40:21.160 --> 40:30.320
you. I got nothing. All right. Uh, Black Wolf says they are adding Bon Jovi keyboard support

40:30.320 --> 40:34.640
this week, so they're going through the back catalog. Yeah, I know. I know. And I'm just

40:34.640 --> 40:39.800
impatient. So what if I have 63 songs to play right now? It's not enough. Plus some of the

40:39.800 --> 40:46.720
keyboard parts are really dopey. Like, um, is it everybody wants to know that one? It's

40:46.720 --> 40:52.440
the other one. Um, Oh, one of those songs that always get the bands mixed up. Tears

40:52.440 --> 40:56.720
for fears is everyone wants to rule the world, right? In excess. Need you tonight is the

40:56.720 --> 41:03.480
song has the dumbest keyboard part ever. It's just 27 notes even on expert. And it's just

41:03.480 --> 41:11.620
do do do. And that's the keyboard part. Do do do. Wow. And so you're playing the wow

41:11.620 --> 41:16.880
like 27 times in the song. It's ridiculous. Like you could beat it on expert and your

41:16.880 --> 41:26.920
score will be like 4700 tops. This is funny. But anyhow, uh, yeah. Um, the game's fun and

41:26.920 --> 41:30.280
the keyboard stuff will get better with the download packs and everything. You know, I'm

41:30.280 --> 41:35.640
actually like tempted to go find like a $10 copy of Lego rock band just to import those

41:35.640 --> 41:41.400
songs into my massive collection. I did. I bet you can find them really cheap use now

41:41.400 --> 41:48.480
or not used with the code. Uh, new, new. Dude, they still make it, right? Yeah. I can probably

41:48.480 --> 41:52.080
find it on Amazon or something. It's dropped in price too much. Uh, all right. I want to

41:52.080 --> 41:54.720
talk about a game no one's talked about yet. No one get into gaming news. I know we've

41:54.720 --> 41:57.700
been doing this for a very long time. There's been a lot of games this week. Uh, pinball

41:57.700 --> 42:04.840
FX two came out on the Xbox live marketplace. It's free, which is awesome. And if you owned

42:04.840 --> 42:09.800
pinball FX one, the game will go, Oh, Hey, since you were a loyal pinball FX one user,

42:09.800 --> 42:16.000
I'm going to just import those tables right on into pinball FX two. Love it. Like, like

42:16.000 --> 42:19.800
just a little thing like that just actually like made me go, that was like actually really

42:19.800 --> 42:24.640
cool. Like they didn't really have to do that, but they did. And then, you know, you can

42:24.640 --> 42:28.520
play demos of the other tables. Any download tables also come right in because I think

42:28.520 --> 42:32.720
I downloaded a buccaneer. I either had paid a small amount and it was free for a time

42:32.720 --> 42:37.880
or something. Oh yeah, it's fun. And that came right into, and just all the different

42:37.880 --> 42:42.040
features that are in it now. Like you, supposedly it does stuff with the Xbox live vision camera,

42:42.040 --> 42:45.960
which made me laugh. Cause uh, now that everything's pushing connect, it's kind of funny that the

42:45.960 --> 42:49.640
vision camera's in there. I don't know if it uses either or I'm not interested in playing

42:49.640 --> 42:53.120
pinball with a camera, but apparently it will take video of you when you're playing. I should

42:53.120 --> 43:01.840
try selling back my vision camera to like $5. All right. Um, but yeah, I was, I was

43:01.840 --> 43:06.720
just very happy that all the tables re-imported and they have a more robust demo system and

43:06.720 --> 43:10.640
yeah, just, just, you can sense that the physics have been upgraded and the interface has been

43:10.640 --> 43:14.400
upgraded and everything has gotten a little tweaked. Just, we've been talking about rock

43:14.400 --> 43:20.100
band, right? Same type of thing. Like it's pinball FX is now like the rock band of pinball

43:20.100 --> 43:25.360
and I am okay with that. I would be even better with that if them and uh, Midway and Williams

43:25.360 --> 43:27.840
and all that, even though I know they're long gone, but like the people who are doing those

43:27.840 --> 43:33.020
pinball collections could somehow like sleep together and bring some of those really classic

43:33.020 --> 43:40.400
pinball tables into the pinball FX engine. That would be awesome. Also, I look at a game

43:40.400 --> 43:46.840
like this and I go with game room being in the state that it's in right now, like I want

43:46.840 --> 43:52.200
Zen studios to get game room. Like I want Microsoft to give that to Zen studios cause

43:52.200 --> 43:57.280
they seem to know how to do this whole micro transaction game within a game thing. Like

43:57.280 --> 44:00.320
I don't know what Microsoft has planned for game room long term. Now, if anything, they

44:00.320 --> 44:03.380
might just sweep it under the rug. Like they've been doing a lot of stuff, but if they plan

44:03.380 --> 44:08.060
on keeping that going, I would love to see it go over there. Even though I think that

44:08.060 --> 44:12.960
studio probably has no interest in anything but pinball, but you never know. Huh? So that's

44:12.960 --> 44:18.800
really it. Uh, that was it for my gaming week. I don't really have anything else to say on

44:18.800 --> 44:23.120
that. So let's get into housekeeping tonight. Join our Facebook, facebook.com slash orange

44:23.120 --> 44:28.160
launch radio. We're also on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R. I think we have a MySpace, but

44:28.160 --> 44:33.320
who is MySpace anymore? Is anyone on MySpace? Any MySpace fans? Didn't think so. Let's get

44:33.320 --> 44:37.920
into some gaming news. We'll start off tonight with Loki. We're only what, 50 minutes into

44:37.920 --> 44:41.840
the show, finally getting to gaming news? I'm totally on MySpace. Just kidding. I'm

44:41.840 --> 44:47.280
not on MySpace cause no one uses it. Uh, I think anyone who's on MySpace just never deleted

44:47.280 --> 44:53.160
their profile two years ago. Exactly. No, um, actually some pretty interesting stuff

44:53.160 --> 45:02.600
going on. Um, Gran Turismo 5. Yeah. It's supposed to be out this week, right? Right? No? Yes?

45:02.600 --> 45:09.400
Um, it didn't end up coming out this week and it's been delayed again. And um, of course

45:09.400 --> 45:14.400
they haven't really said when it's supposed to be coming out. Um, other than just a few

45:14.400 --> 45:20.080
different comments based off of um, the producers of the game and what retailers are saying.

45:20.080 --> 45:29.080
Uh, for example, the uh, creator, uh, Yamaguchi, or was it, uh, Yamauchi, basically was telling

45:29.080 --> 45:36.080
uh, the website uh, um, Japolik, uh, that the discs were being stamped as we speak.

45:36.080 --> 45:41.360
Which I can tell you right now is bullshit. That the game has not been, um, or has not

45:41.360 --> 45:48.480
gone gold and I don't believe is being stamped right now. Um, also apparently retailers are

45:48.480 --> 45:55.920
listing that the game is going to have a, uh, past Christmas release date. Um, some

45:55.920 --> 46:00.240
of them are showing, you know, a 1-1 release date or December 31st. Which I can tell you

46:00.240 --> 46:05.940
right now is just a temporary date. Um, the official word on what's going on with this

46:05.940 --> 46:11.920
is actually, uh, they are shooting for a release before November, but they're not sure if they're

46:11.920 --> 46:15.760
going to hit that mark. If not, it's going to be sometime early December. That's when

46:15.760 --> 46:20.120
you can expect Gran Turismo 5 unless they screw something else up. Which case it will

46:20.120 --> 46:26.640
probably be next year. So, that's what's going on with that. You just gotta wait longer.

46:26.640 --> 46:32.360
The more this is going on, the more I'm kinda like forgetting about this game. Exactly.

46:32.360 --> 46:36.200
You know what I mean? That's kinda sad because Gran Turismo's like a huge franchise and everything.

46:36.200 --> 46:39.000
But the more this is going on, I'm just kinda like, oh, there's all this other stuff. Remember

46:39.000 --> 46:42.640
when Gran Turismo 5 Prologue came out and it was supposed to be a taste of what the

46:42.640 --> 46:48.760
game was like? And now it's not even close to what the game was like? That's funny. Remember

46:48.760 --> 46:55.160
when they had, was it, Gran Turismo 5, like, what was it, it was like Concept or something

46:55.160 --> 47:02.360
like that? It was the free download that was on, um, the Playstation Network. It was ridiculous.

47:02.360 --> 47:07.600
Satellite Minded says in our chatroom at chat.artisanotraday.com, do Grand Theft, or, sorry, I was gonna say

47:07.600 --> 47:13.560
Grand Theft. Gran Turismo 5 delays count as news anymore. I think in this case, yes, because

47:13.560 --> 47:19.560
they're missing the holiday season, if this is all true, which is, you know, pretty damaging.

47:19.560 --> 47:23.680
I mean, it is and it isn't. I think we've shown through this last year that games can

47:23.680 --> 47:29.360
do very well, even if released after the holidays. Case in point, Mass Effect 2 came out, what,

47:29.360 --> 47:35.280
like a week after the holidays. And it did fine. But still, to miss that holiday season

47:35.280 --> 47:39.440
especially with such an epic, epic game, I think is newsworthy. When it's been one that

47:39.440 --> 47:45.840
Sony's been hedging a lot of bets on. But maybe it's just me. Spazinator says, Gran

47:45.840 --> 47:52.480
Turismo 5 is the new Duke Nukem forever. That would be sad. And that's funny, is that it's

47:52.480 --> 47:57.000
actually supposed to be coming out relatively soon. Like, isn't it coming out like first

47:57.000 --> 48:02.680
quarter next year soon? Yes. Wow. I know. I know. Blowing my mind. I may have to take

48:02.680 --> 48:07.400
a day off work for that one. Really? That big a deal. I don't even think I'm taking

48:07.400 --> 48:14.560
a day off for Cataclysm. All right. Anyhow, going to other Sony news. Did you know that

48:14.560 --> 48:20.360
the Tester 2 started this week? Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. Yeah, that's right. I did and

48:20.360 --> 48:25.660
don't care. The Tester 2, of course, you know, this is the sequel to the Tester 1, which

48:25.660 --> 48:31.220
is Sony's original programming for PlayStation Network. And, you know, it's been getting

48:31.220 --> 48:35.080
its share of crap. And, you know, even though I, even I myself am hazing the Tester 2 here

48:35.080 --> 48:40.480
on the show, it's not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. It's just no better than

48:40.480 --> 48:48.480
like an average bravo reality television show. But is that as far as Sony wants to go? Possibly

48:48.480 --> 48:52.480
not if you were to believe PlayStation Network director Susan Fennico. They want to go all

48:52.480 --> 48:57.000
the way. That's right. She wants to go all the way. Saying, quote, I hope five years

48:57.000 --> 49:06.120
from now we'll be winning Emmys for quality shows. No. I'm sorry. No one wins Emmys for

49:06.120 --> 49:11.720
reality shows. It starts with a dream. It starts with a dream, Loki. I look at what

49:11.720 --> 49:15.820
HBO has done over several years, this being a quote, where they started just offering

49:15.820 --> 49:20.720
movies and went into the original production business. By no means am I putting the Tester

49:20.720 --> 49:25.240
with the Sopranos and what have you, but if you want to make yourself the go-to destination

49:25.240 --> 49:30.240
for content, you need to provide content that people can't get anywhere else. We look at

49:30.240 --> 49:34.760
original programming and the Tester as the foundation for building out something much

49:34.760 --> 49:40.720
bigger. I will give them props to the fact that they are, you know, also a movie production

49:40.720 --> 49:48.640
house. So they have the, you know, the resources. I just don't see the Tester as a good example

49:48.640 --> 49:53.980
of what can be done with those resources. It all starts with a dream. I mean, because

49:53.980 --> 49:59.160
honestly with the Tester, I mean, granted, if we knew a lot of, you know, big companies

49:59.160 --> 50:05.400
that we could do wonderful little stunt events with, you know, and stuff, like the first

50:05.400 --> 50:11.100
person driving or, you know, third person driving or whatever, you know, we could probably

50:11.100 --> 50:17.000
pull something off like that on our own with no budget whatsoever. They should totally,

50:17.000 --> 50:20.120
like, they should let- Oh wait, no, I'm sorry. That's, I'm thinking of a different game.

50:20.120 --> 50:24.480
I'm actually thinking of the world's championship gaming show that's actually on there. No,

50:24.480 --> 50:27.680
I haven't seen the Tester at all, actually, so I don't know what they do. But I'm sure

50:27.680 --> 50:32.600
it's, you know, not high budget. They should let the PlayStation Network become the public

50:32.600 --> 50:36.360
access of the gaming community and people should be able to put their own shows up on

50:36.360 --> 50:39.600
there. Oh, like the new podcast. That would be awesome. That would be awesome. Spassinator

50:39.600 --> 50:43.920
PSN in our chat room says, there's only one good thing about the Tester 2, Adrienne Curry.

50:43.920 --> 50:48.680
Need I say more? Really? She's in that? She is a hot mess. Like, that might make it actually

50:48.680 --> 50:53.200
worth watching. That bitch is a mess. Oh, they don't have house parks this year or something?

50:53.200 --> 50:58.680
They have her instead? I think so. Interesting. Because that, oh man, she is, let's just say

50:58.680 --> 51:05.280
she was very pro Prop 19. She was very sad, I'm sure. That didn't pass. Just saying. Satellite

51:05.280 --> 51:09.440
Minded says, Sony will win an Emmy for PSN shows when GT5 comes out. Yeah, because I'm

51:09.440 --> 51:15.320
sure now she won't be able to do pot. Yeah, that was the only thing stopping her. Oh yes,

51:15.320 --> 51:21.920
ah, that no vote really stopped everyone. I'm sure California. Way to go. Anyhow, uh,

51:21.920 --> 51:26.760
you know, you're right though, that Sony has the studio behind it to make this work if

51:26.760 --> 51:33.400
they want to. It's just that this, I don't really see as the real motivator to get things

51:33.400 --> 51:38.440
going, but you know, we'll see what happens. What Sony should do is take some of the pilots

51:38.440 --> 51:45.480
that maybe don't work out very well or better yet, here's a great idea, Sony. Take shows

51:45.480 --> 51:50.400
that get canceled before their prime. And if you want an example of this, just go to

51:50.400 --> 51:55.080
Fox because Fox always loves to cancel things before their prime and get the rest of the

51:55.080 --> 52:01.600
episodes and put them up on PSN. Especially like, can you imagine if something like PlayStation

52:01.600 --> 52:06.120
store had been around when Firefly was on TV? Like hear me out. Like I know there's

52:06.120 --> 52:12.520
Whedon nerds that listen to the show. So imagine like Fox cancels Firefly, but Sony is smart

52:12.520 --> 52:17.160
enough to know, Oh, there was actually this really strong cult audience for the show.

52:17.160 --> 52:21.160
Somebody's already paid to make this show. Let's just buy the rights to put them on PlayStation

52:21.160 --> 52:24.860
network and have it be ad supported. And then that would just draw, you know, and then maybe

52:24.860 --> 52:29.800
it finally finds its audience in this on demand network. Like that could be huge. Now I don't

52:29.800 --> 52:36.680
think Firefly was a Sony studio show. I think, I don't know. Yeah, but, but anyway, take,

52:36.680 --> 52:41.120
just take that idea and apply it to maybe a really good show that Sony might've had

52:41.120 --> 52:45.520
or here's an idea since you've got, you know, you like doing television programming and

52:45.520 --> 52:50.160
stuff like that. Make your own IPTV channels, you know, actually have some different channels

52:50.160 --> 52:54.520
of content on there that are exclusive to the PlayStation network and say maybe you

52:54.520 --> 53:02.600
have to pay a $5 a month fee to access this stuff. That would be kind of neat. Yeah. Oh,

53:02.600 --> 53:08.920
so Hulu. No, not necessarily. That's an on demand type thing. I'm talking about actual

53:08.920 --> 53:13.800
content that's, you know, like a live network where you can tune in at a certain time and

53:13.800 --> 53:19.200
watch something not, you know, Oh, Hey, I want to watch old episodes of this and go.

53:19.200 --> 53:25.360
All right. Well, we'll see what happens with Sony programming later on. Maybe they'll announce

53:25.360 --> 53:32.040
an expansion at E3. Who knows? Uh, but I would expect that Xbox is going to announce a, um,

53:32.040 --> 53:36.440
success for success for the one versus 100 first. Oh wait, they did. And I don't think

53:36.440 --> 53:39.360
it came up anywhere on our show world tonight. Did you hear about this just quickly? I got

53:39.360 --> 53:43.600
to throw this out there. There's a new game coming out for Xbox that is that whole one

53:43.600 --> 53:48.980
versus 100 esque type of thing. The massively multiplayer game. Uh, it's a poker game, which

53:48.980 --> 53:56.960
I'm kind of like sick of poker games. Yeah. Dan plays Texas. Too many of them. Does he

53:56.960 --> 54:02.240
really? Yeah. I mean, there's an audience for it. It's an easy game to learn. It'll

54:02.240 --> 54:06.720
have an audience. I'll try it once, but not interested unless it's strip poker. And even

54:06.720 --> 54:12.560
then I probably wouldn't be connected. That's possible. Connect poker. Now you can connect

54:12.560 --> 54:19.280
in a whole new way. Dark soccer. What do you have for us? Well, we have, uh, something

54:19.280 --> 54:25.360
regarding Apple. They have, uh, filed a patent that looks like it's going to be an augmented

54:25.360 --> 54:33.840
reality game. It has, uh, something on there for targeting and using a real world interactive

54:33.840 --> 54:38.140
game environment. And yeah, from what it looks like on here, it's going to be so you can

54:38.140 --> 54:49.120
shoot people. In the face. Yeah. It even, um, has a mention of a gun attachment for

54:49.120 --> 54:56.260
it. Um, I really don't know what they're doing. I mean, it could be maybe laser tag or could

54:56.260 --> 55:01.320
be that they're just filing it so that no one else does it. Or it could be, you know,

55:01.320 --> 55:06.720
a money shot game. Sorry, I just can't help but think of that thing we played on the show

55:06.720 --> 55:11.240
a couple of weeks ago from the onion. That was the shoot people in the face over and

55:11.240 --> 55:18.360
over game. And then it was like cute furry animals too. Yeah. Yeah. This will be controversial

55:18.360 --> 55:24.080
at all. If you can shoot your friends in the face, maybe it can be like ink blaster. Right,

55:24.080 --> 55:31.840
right. Red ink. Yeah. Red ink. Um, they could also just be patenting this so no one else

55:31.840 --> 55:40.120
can. That's what my thought was. Yeah. Anyhow, that's all I got to say on that. Um, so other

55:40.120 --> 55:45.640
interesting things. Apparently with the new dashboard, and this is, you know, totally

55:45.640 --> 55:51.320
not unexpected. Um, they are actually going to be implementing new features to try to

55:51.320 --> 56:01.480
stop piracy. Um, unhackable. Yeah, about that. Let me guess, some mucky muck up there came

56:01.480 --> 56:06.640
out and said that you can't pirate on this thing. It's, we have, we have made this hackproof.

56:06.640 --> 56:13.240
I don't think anyone said anything about it, but basically they have, um, a new, uh, series

56:13.240 --> 56:19.280
of checks that they do for disks, uh, which I guess hackers are referring to as AP 2.5.

56:19.280 --> 56:23.880
I guess that work in conjunction with security sectors embedded in the disk. If the checks

56:23.880 --> 56:28.780
come back negative, the player receives a dirty disk error and his or her console is

56:28.780 --> 56:35.520
flagged for perma ban. Um, it says, uh, pirates though can hypothetically avoid these checks

56:35.520 --> 56:40.880
by not updating to the new firmware. And though this will prevent them from playing on Xbox

56:40.880 --> 56:47.980
live, which kind of defeats the purpose of avoiding the perma ban. Um, yes, apparently

56:47.980 --> 56:53.440
if you know, well one, if you're burning a copy of the game anyways, you could just delete

56:53.440 --> 56:59.160
the update on it. So that would, uh, you know, bypass that cause not all games that have

56:59.160 --> 57:07.120
the new, uh, firmware attached with them actually require that firmware to run. Um, and also

57:07.120 --> 57:12.360
if you have a J tag console, you can just play and delete the update anyways. And, um,

57:12.360 --> 57:16.680
that way you can avoid actually, you know, having to update your system. Of course, well,

57:16.680 --> 57:21.040
if you have a J tag, you can't update it anyways. Well look, Microsoft has a right to protect

57:21.040 --> 57:24.960
their assets and I get that and everything, but are they bragging about it? Did they come

57:24.960 --> 57:31.280
out and say? No. Digital Foundry did. Well then, you know, it's to be expected in this

57:31.280 --> 57:35.520
case. I just, the only thing that gets me is when they come out and say, oh, well this

57:35.520 --> 57:40.440
system, we've put measures in this to make this unhackable and it's going to do this

57:40.440 --> 57:45.480
and this. That's just an open invitation for people to say, please hack me. But you know,

57:45.480 --> 57:50.380
if Microsoft just quietly did this, that's how it should be done really. Well, here's

57:50.380 --> 57:55.760
the thing too though. Um, it's not foolproof though, because apparently old Samsung and

57:55.760 --> 58:01.280
Hitachi drives do not have that security check in their hardware. So it completely bypasses

58:01.280 --> 58:06.040
it. So you know what people can do? They can spoof their drive with one of these older

58:06.040 --> 58:11.040
drives, and then they can get past all those checks. And replacement drives are only about

58:11.040 --> 58:14.480
20 bucks. Yeah, but that's a lot of work. And that's not a lot of work for someone that's

58:14.480 --> 58:18.040
really determined. Well, yeah, but how many people are that determined? I don't know.

58:18.040 --> 58:22.880
I've spoofed a drive before because I've messed up flashing a firmware on there. It's really

58:22.880 --> 58:32.880
simple to do. Um, but yeah, I mean, you'd really have to want to play burn games. Interesting.

58:32.880 --> 58:37.640
Well, you know, I'm sure we're going to continue to hear news like this as more of these firmware

58:37.640 --> 58:42.080
updates come out. It's really no surprise that half the time new firmware updates. It's

58:42.080 --> 58:45.680
always a back and forth. They'll win. They'll figure out a way around it and they'll come

58:45.680 --> 58:49.720
out with something new, and they'll figure out a way around that, and so on and so forth.

58:49.720 --> 58:53.240
Alright, well let's move on to something a little different, and this has to do with

58:53.240 --> 58:59.080
the iPhone slash iTouch slash iPad, the iOS family of games. There's a brand new service

58:59.080 --> 59:05.440
from Capcom out there. It's a free-to-play iPhone arcade app. It's called Capcom Arcade.

59:05.440 --> 59:10.840
It is free, and you can play Street Fighter II, Commando, Ghouls and Ghosts in 1942. Ooh,

59:10.840 --> 59:16.200
ah, but here's the catch. It's just like Game Room in the sense where you can get tokens

59:16.200 --> 59:22.860
to play games for 99 cents, or you can pay three bucks for unlimited access. Or, here's

59:22.860 --> 59:28.960
the best part, you get three free plays per day. So if you just want to download and play

59:28.960 --> 59:34.840
three times a day, free! Yay! Go get it. What's the sobby from just changing data on your

59:34.840 --> 59:42.120
phone? I have no idea. I'm not that desperate to play more Street Fighter II. I mean, I

59:42.120 --> 59:47.160
played that game until my fingers were bleeding back when I was like 12. You know, I'll play

59:47.160 --> 59:53.200
it once and I'll go, hee hee, this sure controls, like, ass on my iPhone, but it was fun to

59:53.200 --> 01:00:01.940
try. That's really what it's gonna be. Let's not forget, they make terrible controllers.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.840
That's the one thing that's really stopping iOS from moving on is the lack of something

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:11.780
tangible right now. Exactly. But hey, I'm all about free, even if it's just three times

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:17.480
a day. I'll get as much of that out as I can. But where's Quiz and Dragons? That's what

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:24.880
I'm waiting for. Hey, you gotta, you know, keep room for updates. Mm-hmm. Alright, moving

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.880
on, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? We have release dates coming up right after

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.640
this, and classic game of the week, not that far away. Well this sounds really cool, and

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:38.720
something I'm actually thinking about participating in is that Capcom's forum has these contest

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:44.760
rules. Basically until November 22nd, you can do your own artwork for Marvel vs. Capcom

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:51.640
3, and if it basically wins, then you get an Xbox 360, and a couple of Marvel vs. Capcom

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:59.820
3, and a framed print of your own work. Make sure it's not dirty. And your work gets to

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:06.600
actually be in the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 art book. That's pretty cool. I mean, I don't

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:13.080
think that my stuff is all that fantastic, but it'd still be fun to participate. I guess

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:19.480
if you have artistic talent, which won't be me. When they do the voice actor thing, then

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.080
I'll try, but for now. I'd see, I'd just probably end up drawing a picture of Deadpool in his

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:28.600
boxers eating Cheetos, or something. What kind of sick fetish are you into over there?

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.280
Because that's usually how you see them in the comic book. I see. She has a boxer Cheeto

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:37.680
fetish. That's what it is. Well good luck Dark Soccer if you choose to participate.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.360
If not, you're lazy. Alright, let's move on to some release dates. Travel the world and

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:49.660
see what's coming out in a country near you. Yes, this week has a few releases coming out.

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:55.320
Some games I'm sure you've heard about coming out this week, including one. Some modern

01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:01.280
warfare and military game called Call of Duty Black Ops will be coming out on a few systems.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.400
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. There's a version for the Wii, but really isn't going

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:17.520
to play it. And DS. Yeah, I'm sure DS sells a lot of Call of Duty Black Ops. Other fun

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:28.920
things coming out this week of course. I know there's more Kinect games. Oh yay, more? Yes,

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:40.200
more. No, actually, let's see here. God, I hate the new site that they have here. Well,

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:45.840
you know you could always prep these things in advance. Of course not. Just saying. Let's

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.240
see, let's talk about other things that are not necessarily Kinect games, because there's

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:56.200
a lot of those too. We gotta mention all of them, because everybody wants to know. Chuck

01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:02.160
E. Cheese's Playhouse, a crappy game for kids, and that's on Nintendo DS. Noah's Ark, also

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.960
on the Nintendo DS. Chuck E. Cheese's Game Room on Nintendo DS. Nickelodeon Fit on the

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:12.880
Wii, that's really for little kids. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, that's right, the

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.080
one that's Claymation that they have each year, they base the game off that. That's

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:23.440
on the Wii and DS. Family Feud, decades coming out on the Nintendo Wii. What the hell is

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:29.320
Family Feud Decades? Is that like where you get Richard Dawson from the 70s? No, no, no.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.800
Ray Combs from the 80s? It's much simpler than that. You have families dressed up like

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:39.520
different cliches of decades. That is the cheapest cash-in I have ever heard in my life.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:48.840
Cha-ching. Monster Jam Path of Destruction on the Wii, DS, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.240
they actually do have bundles that include a steering wheel, even one for the Playstation

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.440
3, but not for the move. You'd be surprised to find out it's actually for the stupid DualShock

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:06.240
3, because I guess the game uses 6-axis steering. Just Dance Kids, this is also another game

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.560
for little kids. It's Just Dance with the wheels on the bus go round and round and other

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:17.760
things like music from The Wiggles and whatnot. Definitely not something that our age demographic

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.480
listeners would be interested in. Also, Karaoke Revolution Glee, they have a bundle coming

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:32.800
out on the Wii. This game gives me nightmares. Let's see here. Honda Fever, it's basically

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:39.560
just a repackage of another game that came out that sucked. Beyblade Metal Fusion, I

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.120
guess this is actually a series that's still on TV, but they have that game coming out

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:50.200
on the Nintendo DS and the Wii. Oh, and I guess Monster Jam Path of Destruction came

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:56.520
out on PSP as well. This has got to be the worst game I've ever seen. Reload Target Down

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:02.880
for the Nintendo Wii. It is a game where you test fire guns. That's right, it's a game.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.800
You don't shoot people, you target shoot with guns. Well, that way it's safe for the whole

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.720
trashy family. Oh yeah, I'm sure. It's still rated team. Because it's guns! It's not even

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:18.120
worth it, just by Call of Duty. I mean, seriously. Style Lab Fashion Design on the Nintendo DS.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.200
Hasbro Family Game Night, they're doing some bundles for that. One and two are bundled

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:28.720
together on the Wii. Challenge Me Brain Puzzles 2 on the Nintendo DS. Remington Super Slam

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:37.400
Hunting North America on the Wii. Okay, let's see here. Remington Super Slam Hunting Africa

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:44.760
on the Wii. My Sims Collection with both My Sims Racing and I believe just My Sims. Tom

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:52.000
Clancy's Hawks 2 on the Wii, finally coming out now. Rune Factory 3 of a fantasy Harvest

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.560
Moon on the Nintendo DS. Apparently they're doing an ESA game pack. This is something

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:03.680
that they do every year. Usually a certain game manufacturer will actually put out a

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:12.080
collection of stuff. This one comes with Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, Tomb Raider, and Mercenaries

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:19.840
2 for $29.99 and all the proceeds I believe go to charity for that to the ESA if you want

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:27.120
to support that. Some really old ass games. Sing Star Dance, a very terrible add-on to

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:33.920
the Sing Star series. That is on the Playstation 3. The fight lights out. Seriously, do not

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:39.160
buy this game. It was terrible. It's got horrible reviews. You really do not need this game.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.460
The Sly Collection, that's coming out on Playstation 3. It's a recreation of, or I guess, HD versions

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:51.920
of the old Sly Cooper games, and the third one is actually in 3D as well. Ah, yes. Man,

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:58.360
there's a ton of crap coming out. Digging for Dinosaurs on Nintendo DS. Zuzu Pets has

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:04.080
some more games coming out. The Kung Zu on Nintendo DS. I'm just gonna skip past a bunch

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:10.600
of this crap. I guess Harvest Moon is being re-released on Nintendo DS. Really? Well,

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:16.520
same with, they're doing a lot of re-releases on stuff. Rune Factory 2 is coming out. They're

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:20.680
re-releasing that. I think there's probably a price drop. Same with the first one. Re-releasing

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:26.360
all that stuff. The new Xbox controller with that wonderful fixed D-pad is now coming out

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:32.860
this week for $65 if you really want to buy that. And then a few things one week from

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:39.220
today. Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini Land Mayhem coming out on Nintendo DS. And then also one

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:46.200
week from today will be the potential for a new Mario Paint U-Draw tablet with U-Draw

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.740
Studios will be coming out. And then of course the two games that go along with that. Dude's

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:55.400
Big Adventure and Pictionary. And of course that's that tablet thing that looked like

01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:01.040
the Mario Paint type pen tablet thing. And then of course Pictionary is also on Nintendo

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:07.000
DS. And that's it. Finally, jeez. Sorry, there's a lot of crap coming out of this one. And

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.560
I fenced this on crap. Let's go to Japan and see what's coming out over there. On the Xbox

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:16.400
360, Forza Motorsport 3 on November 11th. This is the ultimate edition by the way. Mushihima

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:22.640
Sama Futari version 1.5 is the Platinum Collection. Why do you want this so bad? This is a shooter

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.200
game, isn't it? It is. And it's a really cool shooter. And there's also an iPhone version

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.960
adventure game coming out. Also Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2, Mafia 2, and Scared 2 Fallen

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:37.160
Angel. Also getting a price reduction. Those are all on the Xbox 360 this week. What did

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:45.840
I say? Scared. Oh, my bad. Yeah, Sacred 2. I like a game called Scared 2. Scared 2. PlayStation

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.160
3 has Biohazard 5 alternative edition. That would be Resident Evil 5 with the move. Dragon

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:59.200
Ball Raging Blast 2, Mafia 2, Scared 2, Fallen Angel, my bad. Shinsengoku Musou Online, Soton

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:07.000
Rambo comes out this week as well on the PlayStation 3. This is the online version of, why can

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.880
I, name is slipping my head, the one where you kill everything and smash the button.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:17.360
There's like 7 of those game, Dynasty Warriors, is that it? Yeah. It's that. Oh, what was

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:23.240
the one? Oh, Dynasty Warriors Online. Yeah, it's that. Moving on to other systems on the

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:29.960
Nintendo Wii in Japan this week on the 11th. The 25th anniversary Mario game comes out

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.600
over there as well as see Nintendo Wii in some different colors. Something called the

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.000
Party Game Box 100, use your imagination. Wii Remote Plus controls in all sorts of different

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.680
colors. Black, blue, pink, red, white, Wii. Puyo Puyo 7 gets a price reduction. No one

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:50.640
cur. Jinsei Game, Happy Family gets released as well. Speaking of things that we don't

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:57.120
care about. Uh, PlayStation 2 gets one game this week called Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.920
After School. I can only guess what this game is gonna be about. I'll give you a hint, there's

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:07.560
a girl in a school outfit on the cover. Porn? No, sadly it's not that, but it's probably

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.880
just another, like, you know, we're angsty, we're in school, da da da. Nintendo DS, Crafting

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.360
Mama comes out this week. Puyo Puyo 7 gets a price reduction there as well. Tamagotchi!

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:23.360
Bet you thought those games were dead, yep. Tamagotchi no Narikiri Challenge comes out

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:29.920
as well. That's on the Nintendo DS this week. And lastly going to the Sony PSP, God of War

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:35.480
Goes to Sparta gets its Japanese release this week. Tactics Ogre, Unmei no Wa gets a release

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:41.720
this week. I know that'll be a game that has some people excited. And, uh, Karu Batake

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:47.480
de Sukamete Portable comes out this week. I originally had read that as Karu Bekake,

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:55.120
but it actually is not that, although it looks like this game stars plenty of... Bekake?

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.200
People that you'd probably want to see in a bukake porn. I'm just kidding, they're kids,

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.640
that's gross. Alright. What's wrong with you? How about something else? What's wrong with

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:09.520
you? How about it? Well in the UK we have on the 9th Call of Duty Black Ops, then we

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:17.240
have on the 10th Dance Central, Dance Paradise, Dance Evolution, Dance Masters, Fighters Uncaged,

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:23.160
Game Party in Motion, the Kinect, Kinect Adventures, Kinect Joyride, Kinect Sports, Kinectimals,

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:30.280
Motion Sports, Kinect Adventures, Your Shape Fitness Evolved, and also Raving Ravage, Travel

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:40.040
in Time, and Sonic Colors, Tom Clancy's Hawks 2. That's it. That's all I'm gonna say anyway.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:44.360
See I like how you filter the crap out. Well just cause I go to a... I'm sorry I don't

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:50.280
understand what you're talking about. I'm just messing with you. Alright, uh, let's

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.140
move on. A couple more stories in the Classic Game of the Week. You want me to filter all

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.920
the crap out? I'll just mention one game the next time. Stop. Sorry, this week only comes

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.480
out. We're gonna filter all the crap. It is Chuck E. Cheese as the only game coming this

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:13.120
week. Now, Xbox Live Indie Games has disappeared off the main marketplace menu and you actually

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:18.120
have to dig for it now. It's in Specialty Shops. By the way, it's not that hard to find

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:24.000
you guys. I know. It is a couple menus deep, but it's not like impossible to find. But

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.580
I understand why people are pissed. Sorry, I'll shut up. Yeah, so it is now under Specialty

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:33.960
Shops. Of course, Avatar Marketplace being the first spot on there, but Indie Games is

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:41.360
a close second. And, of course, Xbox Live Indie Game creators are bummed over the fact

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:49.920
that the menu has been slightly hidden, you know, if you will. And, uh, I don't know.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:57.960
It's just, uh, they kind of feel like they've been brushed off, I guess. I don't think it's

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:04.720
that big a deal, to be honest. You know, don't they still let you use web links to, like,

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.840
link directly to items in the store? That's really how you're gonna have to start selling

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.340
games, I think, is really kind of using the web as a presence. And click here to download

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:17.600
to your Xbox now. It is kind of a shame, and I'm really surprised Microsoft hasn't gone

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:23.640
here yet, that they haven't tried to make something like iTunes on your PC that would

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:31.080
be automatically to download to your Xbox. Like, imagine a whole integration with Windows

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.060
Media Center, since that's, you know, where Microsoft, you know, obviously they can't

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:38.200
make iTunes, but they're kind of like competitors to Windows Media Player. Imagine if they had

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.900
something like Windows Media Player with a store in it, where it wasn't just the music

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:46.700
and movies, but things that you could download to your Xbox. Or maybe, like, when you download

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:52.640
a movie, it would download to your PC and your Xbox. But, within that, they could do,

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.700
like, this whole indie games thing, kind of like iTunes does. Like, I don't know, I could

01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:04.060
kind of see that being kind of neat. But, at the same time, maybe it's too much work.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:07.080
Maybe they're trying to sell this whole Kinect thing. And they haven't opened up Kinect to

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.760
indie developers yet, have they? Probably won't for a long time.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:17.160
Um, I don't remember if they have or not. I think maybe Xbox Live Arcade, but not, um,

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.880
I don't know.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.760
Ross Steel, UT is in our chat room. Is there really? Ross Steel, UT, I haven't seen him

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.400
in, like, two years. The indie games aren't any less easy to find than they were before.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.760
They're just butthurt.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:34.760
Well, yeah, I mean, I didn't find them particularly hard to find. And I think, again, if you sell

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.080
yourself on the web, you'll be fine. I can understand, though, where the developers are

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:43.760
feeling a little bit unloved. But keep in mind, there's a lot of things at Microsoft

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.440
right now being unloved. Game Room's another one. Everything's all about the Kinect.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.400
Kinect, Kinect, Kinect, Kinect. Maybe after the holidays, they can focus on that other

01:14:51.400 --> 01:15:00.820
stuff again, but we'll see. Although I somehow, uh, wouldn't be holding my breath.

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:05.640
Something you know is inevitable, though, and is going to happen, is a Bejeweled 3.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.920
That's right, Bejeweled 1 and Bejeweled 2 are some of the biggest freaking games ever

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.560
made. Bejeweled 3 is coming out on December 7th.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.040
And my wife didn't care.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.040
What?

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.040
She's like...

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.040
I thought Bejeweled was the only game she plays.

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.320
What were they going to add to it? I'm like, well, they have this, like, new poker mode

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.880
thing. She's like, that's dumb.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:27.240
Well, wait until she tries. There are also, just so you know, new Quest and Zen modes

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:32.400
are coming to the game, unlockable secret game variants, and there's also supposed to

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:37.800
be smoother gameplay and new music and sound. Twenty dollars if you want to get it through

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:43.520
PopCap.com, but I bet you'll have to wait not even six months and it'll be out on iPhone

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:49.320
and Xbox Live and PlayStation Network and pretty much anything with a controller or

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.320
touch screen.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.100
We'll have Bejeweled 3.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.120
If Bejeweled 3 isn't cutting it for you, there's plenty of other Bejeweled stuff to come, including

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:02.200
Bejeweled Blitz Live. That's right, Bejeweled Blitz Live.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:07.260
It might be on the PC, but they're saying that the classification says it's an Xbox

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:11.340
360 title. So who knows? Maybe it will show up on both.

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:17.460
Maybe it's something where now you'll be able to intermix the Xbox with the Facebook game.

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:19.880
Could be interesting.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.880
By the way, Zuma Blitz is supposed to be coming out very soon as well, too. I think that's

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:28.720
in beta right now. So lots of new games coming out of Pop Crack.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.440
What about Plants vs. Zombie Blitz? I guess I shouldn't hold my breath on that one.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:40.560
Hey, it's the time of the show where we take a stroll down memory lane and allow Dark Sakura

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:44.440
to take the reins for a little bit. Oh, we must be crazy.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.440
As she says, hey, this is a classic video game that you ungrateful children need to

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.120
go back and show a little of. Forget these K'Nex with their fancy infrared lasers and

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.200
the move with their flashing little ice cream cone light thingies.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.700
These are games you can play in your underwear.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:06.080
That's right. These are games you can play with no pants on and you'll like it.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:17.000
The classic game of the week is Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Superheroes.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.640
Because I got a big excited girl boner for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 today.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.920
A bit of Lady Wood? Yes.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:28.920
So we have to start off with the characters from the game.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.920
This is my favorite movie in the game, for the record.

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:40.920
So, yes, the game is the fifth of the Marvel Comics licensed fighting games.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:49.200
This one, actually, instead of being just an X-Men vs. or Marvel Superheroes vs. Street

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:55.200
Fighter, this goes all over the place. And you have to basically get all of these

01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:01.200
people against Onslaught, who I felt was actually kind of a retarded character in the comics

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:08.200
but that's just me. So, moving forward, we have this one is where

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.240
you actually have a random assist character that you start off before the match instead

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:17.920
of bringing one of your teammates in, which I think they've gotten rid of for Marvel vs.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.920
Capcom 3. And then, you know, there were also ways that

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.520
you could select who your little bonus person was.

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.520
And then, you also had duo team attacks. And this music is awesome, too.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:39.520
It's the theme of the Strider family. He's not in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so far, but

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.240
this one. Yet.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.320
So far, I said so far. I thought he was.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:49.520
I was like, why not? But, no, not yet.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:56.520
So anyway, the different characters in this one is you had Spider-Man, Captain America,

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:02.680
Hulk, Wolverine, Venom, Gambit, War Machine, Gold War Machine, Red Venom, Orange Hulk,

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:09.680
and Onslaught on the Marvel side. And on Capcom, you had Ryu, Chun-Li, Zangief,

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:17.080
Mega Man, Jin, Morrigan, Strider Hiryu, Captain Commando, Roll, you should play Roll's music

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.880
now. Lilith, or Shadow Lady.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:27.880
I love Roll had singy-songy music. Yeah, she had singy music.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:42.840
As far as your special partners, you got Unknown Soldier, Luance, and Siva, Saki Omakane, Piran

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:49.840
Fur, Psylocke, Michelle Hart, Iceman, Arthur, Tonpu, Juggernaut, Devilot, Thor, Magneto,

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:56.840
US Agent, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Anita, Jubilee, Rogue, Shadow, and Sentinel.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:01.840
It at least gave the nods over to Tonpu. That was just cool. I laughed.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:08.840
At any rate, there is a perfect version that came out on Dreamcast in 1999, and it had

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:14.840
cross fever modes so you could have four players play simultaneously. There was a version that

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:19.840
came out on the Playstation, which was the EX edition in Japan, but it didn't have the

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:26.840
tag team gameplay, and it didn't have the secondary characters, except just for assists.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:33.840
But it did have the crossover, you could play a tag team with identical teams, which was

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:40.840
kind of stupid. But it did allow you to play as onslaught, and if you beat the game with

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:49.840
Mega Man or something. And yeah, the soundtrack came out, which I've got the soundtrack, and

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:55.840
it is amazing. And it was great, and it opened the door for all this other funness.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:03.840
Of course, Dan got me hooked on playing with Strider Neo. This is other good music.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.840
Everyone should recognize that.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:18.840
Yep, the theme of Mega Man. It was a lot of fun. It's a great game. Definitely one worth

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.840
having on the Dreamcast, because it was perfect. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is really good. I'm looking

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.840
forward to Marvel vs. Capcom 3, but I had to start it with somewhere, and I think this

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.840
is a good place to do it.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.840
It's as good of a place as any.

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.840
Yep, so that's it. That's your classic game of the week.

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:41.840
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Marvel vs. Capcom 1. Back before

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:48.840
there was all these other sequels, and now this new fancy one, although I gotta say,

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:54.840
the videos I was looking at online for the new one, and even seeing it at E3, although

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:58.840
it looks like it's come a long way, just even in the videos I've been seeing online.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.840
Pretty awesome, gotta say. Looking forward to it.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:05.840
Alright, we're gonna take a break. We'll be right back though, guys. Stay tuned. We have

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.840
plenty more show to come. We got our rapid fire news, which there's a lot since we have

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.840
to make up for last week. We're also gonna talk a little more about that whole Kinect

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.840
hacking stuff. We have another story on that coming up in a minute. We're gonna talk about

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:21.840
Fable 3 and Saints Row as well in the Xbox Live Arcade. So don't go anywhere, guys.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:25.840
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:31.840
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. We are taping the 388th episode of

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:37.840
our show live on this November the 7th of 2010. We've been talking a little bit in

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:42.840
Part A tonight about the new Kinect obviously is out, and we all had a chance to get our

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.840
hands on it, which is weird because I still have yet to really play PlayStation Move

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:50.840
outside of E3. But, Loki, you've gotten a chance to get your hands on both at this point

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:55.840
now. What do you think both are gonna offer us in a year's time?

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.840
The move, I think it's gonna pretty much be pretty much what you see right now with

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.840
the Nintendo Wii. The only difference being that since you have the camera in there,

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:08.840
they can do some of the augmented reality stuff, which is actually pretty cool with it.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:17.840
I don't think it's really that different. They have more of a setup now where they're

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.840
gonna use it with more of their hardcore games, I guess, because Killzone 3 is already

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:26.840
gonna have that. SOCOM 4, they've got support for it. So it'll be interesting to see

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:31.840
how they implement that stuff or if it's even gonna be necessary or if you're gonna

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.840
be able to play as well with it. And then, of course, the Kinect. It's hard to say

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:41.840
how that's gonna really... I think there's a lot more potential with the Kinect because

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:46.840
they can pretty much do whatever they want with no controller gaming, but then they

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:51.840
can also, if they wanted to, and they've said it before, they're like, you know we

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.840
can have this so that it works with you playing not using the controller, right?

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:01.840
The complaint is, oh, there's no buttons and stuff. It's like, well, who says that

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:08.840
I can't do that or put out another controller later or whatever. I think there's a lot

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:13.840
more creative freedom with the Kinect than there is with the Move.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:21.840
What do you think this is going to do anyway about the possible Xbox 720, the PlayStation 4,

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.840
the Wii 2, and obviously all these names are hypothetical.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:27.840
I don't know, but if you notice, and I'm not sure if this is necessarily because

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.840
Microsoft is spending more money on advertising, because they are spending a lot of money

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.840
on advertising, but have you noticed with the whole Kinect stuff, there's been a lot

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:41.840
bigger of a splash with the Kinect stuff as far as all the talk shows and stuff like that.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:42.840
Oh, absolutely.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.840
Then there was the Move. The Move just came out and like...

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:45.840
It's here, guys.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:46.840
It's here.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.840
They had commercials. That's mostly of what you've seen for the Move and targeted

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.840
commercials during things like South Park. You'd always see a commercial for the Move.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.840
You know, things of that sort. But yeah, definitely the Kinect is definitely trying to go

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:06.840
that Nintendo route of being on Ellen, being on the News, doing the whole Times Square

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.840
thing that they did. Gonna be very interesting.

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.840
Of course, Nintendo gets to go through this whole hub-a-loo again with the 3DS,

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:17.840
because that's going to be another big thing that, you know, they'll parade that out on

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.840
the Ellen show, too, and she'll go like, wow, it's like I could really see 3D, guys.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.840
You know, and that whole thing. Some corny joke. Ooh, let's dance. You know.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:27.840
Yeah.

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.840
That'll be what happens. So...

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.840
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.840
ActDeaf says, I think the next Wii will be a Super Wii.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.840
Certainly a possibility. I mean, that might be a silly idea, but, you know, the Wii has

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.840
that recognition, just like Nintendo had back in the day as a system.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.840
And then there was the Super NES. You know, that whole Wii HD everyone likes to theorize about it.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:55.840
And Frisbee follows that up with, and then the Wii 64.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.840
RasteelUT says, the Kinect is more novel than the Move. Let's be real.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.840
You agree?

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.840
I think so. And the other thing, like I've said that...

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:08.840
Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I think it's more something we haven't seen before.

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:12.840
I mean, it is and it isn't. It feels like more of an evolution than the Move does.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:18.840
Although, the technology behind the Move sounds pretty cool compared to what we've seen on the Wii.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.840
We just don't see a lot of that in motion yet.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.840
But this whole augmented reality and all that stuff you talk about makes me very excited.

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840
The potential.

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:35.840
And that's the other thing too. The augmented reality stuff is possible with, you know, the Kinect.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.840
I mean, who's to say? Because it can track your body.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:43.840
Who's to say you can't, I don't know, even just have a game come out and have something as simple as

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.840
you hold up a piece of cardboard and there you go.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.840
I mean, it just has to have something like a target for it.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:56.840
And it basically uses the sensors that are in the Move controller and the orb to track that.

01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:01.840
So, there's potential they could do all the same stuff.

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.840
And, you know, it has a good, you know, it can track you really well as we saw with, you know,

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:13.840
Dance Masters where it can do a literal, almost like a green screen of myself while I'm playing the game.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.840
Not that I really want to see that because that's very, I feel like an idiot already.

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:24.840
And looking at myself playing the game, it's just like, why are you doing this?

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:29.840
Let me ask Jamie here for a minute. I don't mean to take you away from our lovely chatters.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.840
We have a chat room at chat.orangetotraday.com.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:37.840
But I know you don't get as into the new stuff, I think, as you have the classics.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.840
You definitely, the most room in your heart is for the classic games.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.840
What do you think about this new, I mean, certainly this is technology we never really saw before in the classic gaming world.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:52.840
What do you think about the Kinect and the Move and all this and its potential impact on gaming?

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.840
I think the Move looks like a sex toy, so I'm completely not interested.

01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:06.840
The Kinect I like. I really do. I think that it combines everything that they were trying to do with the Move and with the iToy.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:14.840
Except it does it right. And it definitely gives you more of that virtual environment feel to your games.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:20.840
That, I think, is great. I think that I can see it going two ways.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.840
I can think we're going to get more and more and more like that and it'll be great. Or it will wear off after a while.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.840
The novelty will wear off and people want to sit back on their couches with their, you know, controllers in their hands.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:37.840
I like half agree with Dark Sakura. I kind of, the Kinect, there's some things about it that strike me as gimmicky too.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.840
I mean, and I think it's that we haven't really seen its full potential yet.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:43.840
Whereas at least Sony's kind of like throwing these things out there.

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:50.840
Like, I don't write off the Move quite as fast, but I will say right now, there's nothing I really want on the Move.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:54.840
There's nothing the Move is doing for me and the type of games I like right now.

01:28:54.840 --> 01:29:00.840
Well, there's a lot of possibilities for things they can do. Remember the whole head tracking demo that we saw with the Wii?

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:05.840
Where they have the guy wearing the Wii Remote? You can do that with the Kinect because it tracks your head.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.840
So they can do that kind of stuff for like first person cheers. That's what I was saying.

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:15.840
That it's not necessarily, you don't have to have a game where you're just moving around like crazy.

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:19.840
They can just have it where they track your head. You're doing all your movements and stuff on the controller.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:25.840
And you can still be slightly more immersed in the game and it can be an optional feature, which is kind of cool.

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.840
You can bring the mocap games home.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:28.840
Yeah.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:31.840
I'm really interested to see what next year's E3 is going to be.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:35.840
Because at next year's E3, all of this is going to be the norm.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:41.840
The 3DS is going to be out by next E3. You know, and all the rumors about the March release date or what have you.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:42.840
It'll be March.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.840
It'll be out before June. That's a given.

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.840
All of this stuff is now going to be the norm at next E3.

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:51.840
Move is now out. Kinect is now out. 3DS is now out.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:57.840
And it's going to be really interesting because the next E3 is now going to be all about, okay, now what are you going to do with this?

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:01.840
Now that it's out. What have you come up with in the past year for how to use this technology?

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:07.840
It's going to be a very interesting show. I'm really excited about it. Even though it's like, what, nine months away?

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.840
I want to go this year.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.840
Yeah. Hopefully we can make it all work for us.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:13.840
Alright.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:23.840
But, you know, I was just thinking, if you put both in front of me and said pick which one you want for free, I'd grab the Kinect.

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:30.840
I think me too, but only because it goes back to the rule of the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:36.840
And I wouldn't write the move off yet because a year from now we might be looking at the opposite.

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:39.840
Like, kind of like, that's just kind of what I see.

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:44.840
Is that I'm not sure I really see where Kinect is going, but maybe I'll be proven wrong at the next E3.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:54.840
I think, if anything, if the whole point of releasing these new motion systems were to capture the new audience that they're looking for, the more casual audience,

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.840
I think the Kinect has done a better job of that.

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.840
Or at least it seems like it.

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.840
I don't think a lot of people care.

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:05.840
And that's too bad, because it's not a bad piece of hardware.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:08.840
It's just it's not too different than what's already being done with the Wii.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:16.840
It's just slightly better, and yeah, granted the hardware is better, so you can do better looking games, but it's not completely different.

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:21.840
Whereas I would say the Kinect is completely different than what they're doing with the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.840
It is separate.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:30.840
Well I think one thing to consider as far as new hardware goes, I don't think it came up anywhere else in our show roll, but something that's been coming up.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:37.840
This was a lot the week we were out, but were those rumors of the PSP phone, and some of the screenshots that showed up and all that.

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:41.840
So if this new PSP evolution is going to be shown at E3, could be interesting.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:48.840
But I don't think it's going to be anything outside of this whole motion gaming stuff and what we're talking about here.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.840
But we'll see.

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:55.840
Anyhow, let's move on into some rapid fire news and some of the quick stories we have for you now.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:59.840
We have a lot since we had a week off, so Loki, we're going to start with you for the quick news.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:00.840
Yes.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.840
Oh sorry, Twitter topics. Get them in quick. You have about two more minutes.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.840
Yes. So anyways, some interesting stuff going on.

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:14.840
Of course, we were talking a little bit about Dance Central and Harmonix being the ones that like to support download content.

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:18.840
They had some download content day one, whether you like that or not.

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:25.840
New songs that are coming out for Dance Central are going to run you 299 or 240 Microsoft points each.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:35.840
The first three songs that they had available, Neo's Because of You, Lady Sovereign's I've Got You Dancing, and Sean Paul's Temperature.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.840
And I guess those are all available now, and hopefully we'll see some more download content next week.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:52.840
And let's see here. It didn't really say if the same moves are in there or if they're recycled or whatever, but I think it's kind of neat.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:33:00.840
I really wish that the game had like a kind of a routine editor because they could easily do that with the flash cards and stuff they have on there.

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:03.840
Can anyone say the sequel?

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.840
Yeah.

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:11.840
Of course, Black Friday is not too far away, and with Black Friday, of course, the ads will leak out.

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:17.840
The first one to leak out with gaming related information, of course, would be from Sears.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:24.840
And they had some new bundles and stuff for the holidays and some new interesting colors for different things.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:31.840
For example, the limited edition red and green DSI bundles for $150, which include Mario Party DS.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:42.840
They've got a 160GB PlayStation 3 bundle for $300, which includes Uncharted 2 and a Blu-ray of the new movie Karate Kid.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.840
PSP...

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.840
What a deal.

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:49.840
The PSP 3000? Well, I think those two games are free.

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.840
No, just the whole Karate Kid Blu-ray and...

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.840
It's not a bad movie. I liked it.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.840
I just refuse to see it. I'm being stuck up for no reason.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.840
It was good, okay?

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:09.840
The PSP 3000, a bundle for $130, which includes LittleBigPlanet and UMD of the Karate Kid.

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:14.840
4GB Xbox 360 bundle for $200, which includes Halo Reach.

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:17.840
That's not bad.

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:21.840
They had $10 off of a standard, I guess, Wii bundle.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:30.840
Also, they're going to be doing discounts on different games like Medal of Honor, Fable 3, Halo Reach.

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.840
All will be available for $40, which is pretty awesome.

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.840
Actually, this is kind of cool.

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:42.840
One of the games that's being marked down to $40, which will be just coming out around that time,

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.840
Need for Speed Hot Pursuit.

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:50.840
If you're interested in that game, which you should be because it's by Criterion and they do really awesome racing games,

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:53.840
you should definitely check it out.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:59.840
I'm just saying, Loki, that of the Smith Kids, I think Willow is more talented because she whips her hair back and forth.

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.840
I don't know. The movie was not bad. I liked it.

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.840
Whatever you say. Isn't it the Kung Fu Kid?

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:08.840
Yes, it is the Kung Fu Kid.

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.840
Just saying.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.840
They think we're dumb, so whatever.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:21.840
Then, of course, with that, there's some new Xbox demos that came out on the marketplace this week.

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.840
Rock Band 3, which is pretty awesome, so you can check out a few songs from that.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:33.840
Apache Air Assault, which is a helicopter attack game that's coming out on the 360 and PS3 in, I believe, next week or so.

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:41.840
Then, the most retarded addition to that would be Joyride, which, if you have the Kinect,

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:47.840
you'll realize that there is already a demo for Joyride on the disc of Kinect Adventures.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:54.840
Why you would need to download an additional demo is beyond me, but have at it, I guess.

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:58.840
Definitely check out those demos if you haven't yet.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:05.840
Dance Central, Joyride, Your Shape Fitness, and I believe that was it on there.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:11.840
But, hey, three games you can check out for free, because I didn't notice that right away, and it said,

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.840
Other Kinect games? What's that? I'm like, oh, there's demos on here! Awesome!

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:19.840
Oh my gosh!

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.840
So, yeah, check that out.

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:30.840
And then, finally, I don't know, this is kind of ridiculous, but apparently with the Wii version of the Michael Jackson,

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:38.840
the experience game, you're gonna get the jewel-studded white glove to play the game with,

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.840
I guess, so that you can feel more like Michael Jackson.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:46.840
Is it possible to think something is lame and yet totally awesome at the same time?

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.840
Like, this is totally awesomely lame.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:57.840
Like, it's so bad, it's good. It's bad, it's bad, it's really, really bad.

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.840
You know it.

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:07.840
Oh, what I would pay to see Loki modeling one of these Michael Jackson gloves.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.840
I may have to get the game when it comes out for the Kinect.

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:13.840
You know, I gotta say, it actually looks kind of awesome.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:18.840
Like, let's face it, Michael Jackson had some badass songs, and you know there's gonna be good dances.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:23.840
It's just dance with Michael Jackson songs, and with optional karaoke.

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:27.840
I don't give a shit about the optional karaoke, but I think that would be awesome.

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:31.840
I fucking love Michael Jackson's stuff. I don't care what people say that he did or did not do.

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.840
He was an awesome music artist.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.840
I'm with you. If you just ignore all the other stuff.

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:43.840
And he has some new songs coming out apparently that there are rumors saying that they're so sound like doing some of them, but who gives a fuck?

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.840
Okay, everything that's been going on with like Tupac and Biggie when they were, you know, gone before their time,

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:52.840
and yet it seems like Tupac is still releasing a new album every other year from some shit they dig up,

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:56.840
expect it to be even worse with Michael Jackson.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:05.840
Like, there will be a new album every year for as long as you're alive, and then there will soon be the rumors about he never really died.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:10.840
They faked the death, and the body that came out of the house wasn't really him, and all this stuff.

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:16.840
And, you know, he did it to escape his personal problems, even though his kids were up there on stage crying.

01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:20.840
And two more songs apparently have been announced for the game.

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:28.840
One of which is my wife's absolute favorite Michael Jackson song, one I kind of like, Speed Demon, and Dirty Diana.

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:32.840
Her absolute favorite song.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.840
That's one of my favorites too.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.840
You know what? My favorite actually isn't one of his dancey ones.

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.840
Uh, Man in the Mirror?

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.840
Well, she's out of my life.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:44.840
Interesting.

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:52.840
Anyhow, we need to have a whole Michael Jackson the game launch party, but I just don't think everyone else would be as into it.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.840
I just don't want to get in on the weed.

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.840
I think the generation after us too, which makes up a lot of our listeners.

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:01.840
They have terrible taste in music, okay?

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:07.840
They weren't around when it was about Michael Jackson on MTV, you know what I mean?

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:11.840
Like, we literally grew up with him, you know?

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:13.840
It's just different.

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.840
I remember when Thriller was on every hour.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.840
Well, he and my mom were the same age.

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:19.840
Oh wow.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:27.840
So, you know, I went through all of, you know, her old stuff and, you know, I grew up with the whole thing.

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:31.840
Alright, anyhow, let's move on and talk about other gaming news.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.840
You Don't Know Jack, oh god, I love this game and I'm so excited it's making a comeback.

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:39.840
Because they did kind of burn that series into the ground.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:43.840
Like, there was all these You Don't Know Jack games back in the day, like You Don't Know Jack the Ride and all this stuff.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:40:09.840
Those are actually kind of cool.
