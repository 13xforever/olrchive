0	18760	The creators of Rock Band are up for sale.
18760	23520	A popular DS title finally gets localized for Japan and did the indie games movement
23520	31600	Backlash caused change at Microsoft.
31600	35920	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35920	36920	Radio.
36920	39400	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
39400	43520	Walking you through gaming chat over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and with
43520	49040	me as always, my awesome co-host, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
49040	50640	I'm upset with you, Rob.
50640	51640	Why now?
51640	52640	Because of this game.
52640	53640	What game?
53640	56320	Ooh, you're playing Knights of the Old Sorority as we talked about last week.
56320	57320	Yes.
57320	59120	Knights of the Vampire Mafia War thing.
59120	60120	Excellent.
60120	61120	I blame you.
61120	62120	Well, it is my fault.
62120	64400	We'll talk about stupid clicky games in a minute.
64400	68840	But we have to say hello, of course, to the one and only tech master, eBay-loving, Loki.
68840	69840	Hey.
69840	71360	How you doing, Loki?
71360	72360	I'm doing fine.
72360	73360	All right.
73360	74360	What are you shopping for on eBay now?
74360	75360	Oh, I'm not shopping for anything.
75360	76360	I was just looking at something.
76360	78720	I was just curious to see how much it went for.
78720	81760	Do you do this at home too, shopping on eBay all the time, or does the wife get pissed?
81760	83440	I don't actually shop on eBay all the time.
83440	84440	All right.
84440	85440	All right.
85440	89480	I was going to pick up something later on, but not for a while.
89480	92240	They have this XCM VBox 2.
92240	97760	It allows you to play Xbox games and stuff like that, or pretty much anything that has
97760	101960	a component in or a component out on your PC without lag.
101960	106080	So like, for example, the other day when I was shuffling to get it to work correctly-
106080	107920	I remember the DJ Hero 2 on a break.
107920	109820	I would have been able to play it just fine.
109820	115520	So I might pick that up, because it will be handy for different things.
115520	116960	But yeah.
116960	122000	That and my- rather be playing Grand Theft Auto license plate frame that I probably should
122000	124520	get for my car, because that'd be funny.
124520	125940	All right.
125940	130320	By the way, I went over to Loki's house to play some Kinect the other night, and that
130320	132040	was Good Times.
132040	133040	Yep.
133040	137080	Shaking the butt in front of the camera that takes the pictures over and over again.
137080	141440	My room is really small to play.
141440	143000	So is my apartment, so it's all good.
143000	146560	I'm thinking of mounting the TV to the wall, just for multiple reasons, because the cat
146560	147960	also likes to use a scratching post.
147960	150600	There you go, pretty soon you're going to have the baby running around, so it might
150600	151600	not be a bad idea.
151600	152600	Nah, I'm not too worried.
152600	156120	Well, I mean, you get a bit of- you got at least nine months to go, but you know.
156120	157680	I'm not worried about that.
157680	162600	I think, though, mounting it to the wall would give me an extra foot or two to be able to,
162600	166800	you know, so I won't have to be up against the couch to actually play, you know, Kinect
166800	167800	adventures.
167800	169880	It's dumb, that requirement.
169880	173280	By the way, finally, because it's just, I hardly ever get to Loki's house anymore, I
173280	176360	don't know why, but I finally got to meet the baby, and I got to see the nursery that
176360	181280	is all internet famous, like, you know, the pictures were on, what, Game Stops magazine
181280	182640	thingy, right?
182640	183640	They found him through Flickr or whatever.
183640	186840	I was going to take some video for you guys, but there was, you know, the baby was going
186840	190440	to bed, it wasn't a good time, but maybe one of these days I'll get the video.
190440	192200	I can take video too, I guess.
192200	194200	I mean, I do have video cameras.
194200	197640	It's a nice setup, you should kind of show off a little more.
197640	200000	It's very gamer nerdy.
200000	205420	Let's just hope the baby does not grow up to resent video games, that would be a tragedy.
205420	211200	By the way, speaking of nerdy stuff, I saw the best license plate in the world today.
211200	212200	You ready?
212200	213200	Ready, nerds?
213200	218760	It was LoadStar81.
218760	223000	So I don't know, like, I don't know if the driver of that car, California plate, LoadStar81
223000	225760	listens to the show, but if you do, you made me laugh.
225760	229880	I was behind you today, and yeah, good times.
229880	232680	Also joining us tonight, say hello to, we have a special guest in the studio, he's been
232680	236520	joining us off and on over the past few months, and he's having an on night tonight.
236520	238400	Say hello to the one and only, Alan.
238400	239400	Hello.
239400	240400	Or Salacious Pop.
240400	241400	Yes.
241400	242400	That's the case maybe.
242400	243400	How are you, Salacious Pop?
243400	244400	I'm great.
244400	245560	I don't know why, but I feel like I should say that name all British style.
245560	246560	Salacious Pop!
246560	247560	Yeah.
247560	248560	All right.
248560	250840	So what, how's your week been, Salacious Pop?
250840	251840	Good.
251840	252840	Good?
252840	253840	Are you going to be giving me one word answers all night?
253840	255720	It's going to be a great radio show.
255720	256720	Yes.
256720	257720	All right.
257720	262120	Maybe you'll have more to say when we get into gaming weeks, which I think we'll start
262120	263120	off with now.
263120	264960	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
264960	270240	Knights of the Vampire War, Crystals, Sorority Life, Farm Town.
270240	272800	Yeah, I played some of that crap.
272800	279960	And I played some, what is it, Chocobo's Tower, because it's really cute, and it plays the
279960	283000	Chocobo Farm music from Final Fantasy 7.
283000	286400	Should I tell my story about Chocobo Farm Town or whatever that is now or later?
286400	287800	Go ahead.
287800	290920	So I started playing that game because they have a banner under the whole, like, Knights
290920	294040	of the old Crystal Sorority War game on Facebook.
294040	297800	I started playing the Chocobo Tower, and it's actually kind of cute.
297800	302240	There's some things about it, but I was, like, there's a lot to it, and a lot of it's just
302240	304040	kind of WTF.
304040	306040	And Alan walks in while I'm trying to play this earlier.
306040	307040	He's like, what are you doing?
307040	312160	I'm like, I'm trying to play this game, and I'm trying to breed my Chocobo with Jamie's
312160	313160	Chocobo.
313160	316960	Like, I went to her farm to try and sex her Chocobo while she's not online to defend it.
316960	319720	And Alan's like, well, wait, your Chocobo's just a baby.
319720	320720	You can't do that.
320720	322000	I'm like, I just fed it a growth cake.
322000	323000	And then I'm like, what is this?
323000	325520	Is this what my life has become?
325520	329240	I'm talking about breeding Chocobos like it's real life?
329240	331560	Is this the future of video games?
331560	332560	It's a sad, sad world.
332560	334680	It's all defensive that you aged it with the magical cake.
334680	336080	You're like, I gave it the cake.
336080	337760	What are you talking about?
337760	338760	Look at your life.
338760	340760	Look at your choices.
340760	344400	Like, I hear you judging me, but I gave it cake.
344400	346400	It looks what I saw of it.
346400	351400	It just looked like a sort of more detailed web, sort of digipet Tamagotchi type thing.
351400	353400	Because you have to brush it when it gets dirty.
353400	354800	So you click on the little bird.
354800	357980	It's like pet society, only they go battle each other.
357980	360680	It's ridiculous stupid, yet I'm playing it anyway.
360680	362120	They go off for hot chicken love.
362120	365320	And I totally sex Jamie's chicken when she wasn't looking.
365320	370840	And, and I snuck in her ranch last night and put feathers in the Chocobos hair.
370840	374360	I'm going to go take them because then I'll get extra luck for them.
374360	376360	Oh, nice.
376360	377800	You punked out my Chocobo.
377800	380040	You pimped my Chocobo.
380040	381360	It's called Pimp My Chocobo.
381360	384720	You know, this is not any better than playing, say, Farmville.
384720	386200	So I am going to look at you in shame.
386200	387560	No, because it's Square Enix.
387560	388560	No, I'm sorry.
388560	395300	And all the artwork in the Knights of the Crystal Republic, Vampire Wars, is by the
395300	397960	same guy who did Tactic's artwork.
397960	398960	So that's why it's all pretty.
398960	399960	And it's not Farmville.
399960	400960	Oh, okay.
400960	402720	Well, I must be completely wrong then.
402720	404720	Yes, you are.
404720	405720	Except I'm not.
405720	407240	Because that's never happened in the course of this show.
407240	408240	I'm never wrong.
408240	410280	Are there any other video games you'd like to talk about?
410280	411280	Yes.
411280	418040	I played a bunch of the Avatar game that got left at my house, what, three months ago?
418040	419480	So you're finally getting around to it?
419480	420480	I like it.
420480	422400	So being an Avi in Second Life didn't work out for you.
422400	423400	So now you get to...
423400	427040	I got tired of those people.
427040	432680	But I really liked the game, except that you're Ikran, the banshee thing.
432680	436480	I parked it so I could go get some stuff out of these flowers.
436480	438360	I came back and it was dead.
438360	439360	It got shot up.
439360	444620	It was laying dead in the water, and I'm like, now where am I going to get another one?
444620	446600	So I was like, well crap.
446600	450720	Did you have an emotional breakdown like the characters in the movie went there?
450720	451720	Yeah.
451720	456880	Well, it's sort of one thing to be neurologically tied to a creature as it's dying, but that's...
456880	457880	Apparently not too much.
457880	460920	It's like, eh, I'm going to go pick some flowers over here.
460920	461920	Hm.
461920	465200	Since something's being shot, better not worry about that.
465200	466200	Flower picking time.
466200	467680	No, I didn't even hear it getting shot.
467680	471120	Because there's like little tiny soldier men all over the place, because you're like ten
471120	474240	feet tall and they're like, little.
474240	478040	In fact, it was like when the character first hops around in her Avatar body and walks around,
478040	481360	she goes up to the human people and goes, you're so tiny!
481360	482360	It's cute!
482360	484400	Let me squish your tail in your head!
484400	485680	I picked a female character.
485680	489560	I need to introduce the ever-present fourth guest on our show, even though technically
489560	491920	Salacious Pulp is the fourth guest tonight.
491920	497080	We have our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night
497080	502220	at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and you can join us in chat at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
502220	506260	Let's see, Jim Salley in our chatroom says, Japan's working on genetically creating chocobos
506260	507260	right now.
507260	508260	Hm, could be.
508260	509760	They need to talk to the KFC people.
509760	512600	Frisbee says, Navi or Navi?
512600	513600	Hello!
513600	514600	Hey!
514600	515600	Watch out!
515600	516600	Listen!
516600	517600	Hey!
517600	518600	Dark Sakura!
518600	519600	Listen!
519600	520600	Hey!
520600	527320	Don't make me smite you.
527320	530680	Dan got Call of Booty Black Ops.
530680	534200	Now that's a game I play.
534200	537200	No, it's Call of Duty.
537200	540480	And speaking of Avatar, because it has a dude as the main guy's voice.
540480	541480	Oh really?
541480	542480	Yeah.
542480	544480	Did you hear though that you can play the full game of Zork in there?
544480	545480	Yes you can.
545480	549680	I was listening to Bobby tonight on the car ride over, and yes, he was talking about it
549680	552280	on his show, and I was like, that's actually really cool.
552280	556400	Like Call of Duty, not my genre of game, not disrespect in the game, I realize a lot of
556400	558560	people play those games, I don't.
558560	559560	And the minigame.
559560	560600	But I think that's cool.
560600	562240	That plays a lot like Smash TV.
562240	565560	Oh, the zombie game or whatever, yeah yeah yeah.
565560	569480	Dan was like all over that, and then he was like, oh it's like Smash TV, and his friend
569480	574040	had never played Smash TV, so Dan's like we're turning this off, we're playing Smash TV.
574040	575040	Call of Booty.
575040	576640	They need to make that porn.
576640	577640	I know, totally.
577640	579640	It would not be as great as the porn.
579640	580800	Oh, porn tangent!
580800	581800	Sound the alarm.
581800	582800	Woop woop!
582800	584520	Okay, so we're at Loki's house, right?
584520	589220	And uh, Loki has tons, just so y'all know, Loki and the Mrs. have tons and tons and tons
589220	591360	of pornography stored on their Xbox.
591360	594600	But it's not like real- It's actually on my PC, but we stream it.
594600	595600	Whatever.
595600	596760	It's not real porn.
596760	598040	It's all like funny porn.
598040	601120	And we watched a porno called Not the Cosby's- No, there's lots of real porn on there too,
601120	602120	but we watched funny porn.
602120	603120	We watched funny ones.
603120	604120	Okay.
604120	605120	That's just inappropriate.
605120	606120	You don't just whip out normal porn.
606120	607120	Oh, okay.
607120	608120	Sorry.
608120	609120	Having a dinner party.
609120	610120	Hey, look, wow!
610120	611120	I'm such a 12-year-old.
611120	612120	I know you are.
612120	615720	All right, if you want to see her 12-year-old antics, join her tear room.
615720	623660	We were watching Not the Cosby's 2, which were all these Cosby family lookalikes, and
623660	626600	they were like having sex, but not really with each other.
626600	629720	There were all these like get- But the weird thing about it to me was that there was like
629720	634440	15 minutes of setup and like parity to the plot.
634440	636240	And it was very- It was probably the longest intro I've ever
636240	637240	seen where it was actually just dialogue.
637240	639720	I like how my gaming helped turn to porn.
639720	642160	I just want to say it was also very disturbing that there was a Rudy.
642160	644560	There is already a Call of Booty, actually.
644560	645560	Is there really?
645560	647880	It is Call of Booty, Modern Horror Fair.
647880	650460	Ah, of course, Modern Horror Fair.
650460	651460	My bad.
651460	652460	Ah, yes.
652460	657440	God bless the porn industry.
657440	658440	Amen.
658440	664480	Speaking of video games and porn, and we covered this on Comic Insanity this morning because
664480	666760	it was WTF news.
666760	673880	Some guy on RPG Maker 3000 made Marvel Brothel, where Professor X decides that instead of
673880	678680	bridging the gap between humans and mutants, instead of sending out his heroines to go
678680	681880	help people, he's going to pimp them out.
681880	683920	I had a story coming up on that later.
683920	684920	You did?
684920	685920	That's all right.
685920	686920	Nobody cared.
686920	687920	It's all right.
687920	688920	I didn't know.
688920	689920	Here's the deal, guys.
689920	690920	Here's the deal, guys.
690920	694680	When I report it as news later on in the second half of the show, I want you all to act surprised.
694680	695840	You've never heard about this before.
695840	697320	This is totally new information.
697320	698320	Okay.
698320	699320	So just- I'm sorry.
699320	700320	No, it's okay.
700320	702840	Just everybody just make me feel important.
702840	705920	And when I talk about this in the second half, I want you all to pretend you've never heard
705920	706920	about this before.
706920	707920	Anyway, continue.
707920	708920	Pretend Rob's covered in angry ticks.
708920	709920	Oh, well, Rob.
709920	711920	You're buzzing.
711920	721720	Anyways, yeah, they look- the guy that they have playing Bill Cosby is just a ringer for
721720	722720	Bill Cosby.
722720	725760	He's a comedian, though, so he doesn't actually do any of the porn in there.
725760	731640	He takes the high road, I guess, but no, but seriously, though, the guy looks and sounds
731640	732640	like Bill Cosby.
732640	733640	It's just weird.
733640	734640	He does.
734640	735640	It's kind of scary.
735640	738600	And then I was really disturbed by the fact there was a Rudy, but at least I didn't see
738600	740720	her naked, even though I'm sure she was 18.
740720	742640	I mean, that would just be wrong.
742640	745400	But there was- I think Denise was the only one I saw.
745400	747440	Who went off to college in a different world?
747440	748440	Okay, that was Denise.
748440	750840	Denise got banged in one of the scenes, and that's the one we watched.
750840	754980	And I was like, okay, yeah, all right, turn it off.
754980	758360	And then we watched Harry Potter, God of the Little Fire with Netflix- or Netflix with
758360	759360	Riff Tracks.
759360	761120	That has to be funny.
761120	763000	I watched part of Avatar with Riff Tracks.
763000	767000	That was pretty funny.
767000	768400	I know I played other stuff.
768400	775040	I played Robot Unicorn Attack in the middle of Starbucks again, which is pretty fun.
775040	780280	And yeah, that's Carl of Duty.
780280	782280	Yeah, Tigerclaw linked me to this.
782280	783280	Carl of Duty.
783280	784280	I've seen that.
784280	786280	It's Black Cops, and it's Carl from Family Matters.
786280	788160	And it's very badly photoshopped.
788160	791800	Which, funny enough, when we were watching this Not The Cosbys thing, I said, when are
791800	795680	they going to do the one with Family Matters, but they will actually have the daughter from
795680	796680	Family Matters.
796680	798360	Oh, she's doing porn?
798360	799360	Yeah.
799360	800360	The middle one.
800360	803520	That'd be tough, because they had also done the same thing with Saved by the Bell, but
803520	804520	they didn't.
804520	806600	Instead, they chose to have really funny wigs on them.
806600	811320	And Rob, I totally saw something that made me think of you.
811320	813080	The Showgirls Anniversary Edition.
813080	814080	I bought it.
814080	816680	Damn it, now I can't buy it for you.
816680	817680	I'm sorry.
817680	818680	Which anniversary?
818680	819680	Blu-ray, whatever.
819680	820680	15th, I think.
820680	823800	Is it sad that I know that?
823800	824800	Yes it is.
824800	825800	Anyhow, video games.
825800	826800	Yes, your gaming wig.
826800	828560	What else did you want to talk about?
828560	829560	No.
829560	831720	Loki, how was your gaming wig?
831720	833280	I didn't play a whole lot.
833280	837680	Mainly just Grand Theft Auto, and then the Kinect stuff, I played a little bit of Dance
837680	840240	Central because it was odd.
840240	845280	My living room was big enough to play, you know, Kinect Adventures at one time, but somehow
845280	847100	I guess it shrunk.
847100	850760	Or maybe I didn't calibrate my system again since I switched TVs.
850760	854960	But for whatever reason, I couldn't play Kinect Adventures because it kept saying that I was
854960	859420	too close to the camera even though I was, you know, several feet away.
859420	864000	So you ended up playing Dance Central, and it's fun.
864000	870600	I tried playing some of the harder songs, like Poison, and I tried it on Medium, and
870600	871600	I'm sorry.
871600	878400	When it asked me to do the Charleston, I just was like, I'm not following this.
878400	882080	I do not have the coordination to do what they wanted me to do.
882080	883840	I know how to do that dance.
883840	884840	Well good.
884840	888080	I finished that part of the song, but this is the rest of it.
888080	893600	Oh, and everybody had fun laughing at me because I had to do the, like, I don't know, they
893600	896840	called it the poison where you're like, I don't know.
896840	898840	It's hard to describe.
898840	903000	But yeah, I haven't really played too much on that, and actually I had to go back and
903000	907680	play them again because I had all my stuff saved on my just offline account that's on
907680	908680	that system.
908680	913720	Because it's a pain in the ass because I use a different system at work, and so I have
913720	919840	to constantly, you know, because god forbid they make it simple, you know, to move your
919840	922120	profile back and forth between two systems.
922120	924720	Oh no, you have to recover it between systems.
924720	926220	That is a little ridiculous.
926220	929840	I mean, it should be as easy as putting in your username and password, and they'll make
929840	935280	it so easy to go to friends' houses and, you know, do the rock band thing or whatever.
935280	936280	Exactly.
936280	937280	Connect.
937280	942480	Or, or, a memory card, you know, because that works with a memory card if you play offline.
942480	946640	But as soon as you connect it to live, oh I'm sorry, this is not meant for this system,
946640	948800	you need to recover your profile.
948800	950600	And your profile is not that big.
950600	953000	I mean, it's a few megs at the most.
953000	955960	But it takes like a goddamn half hour to download.
955960	957680	It takes forever to go through this step.
957680	961240	Well, I don't know about a half hour, because Alan and I kind of have to do that a lot.
961240	965800	It took me ten minutes, and I have a really fast internet connection, so it's just, it
965800	970360	doesn't matter how fast your connection is, it just takes forever to download a stupid,
970360	972880	you know, ten meg file or whatever.
972880	974880	It just, it's very inconvenient.
974880	976600	That's why I haven't really done that yet.
976600	982880	I just need to get rid of my other system and then, you know, go from there.
982880	983880	Good times.
983880	987240	And then other than stuff on there, I played some iOS games.
987240	991200	I just played a little bit of rock band, and that's kind of fun.
991200	994920	And you know, it kind of makes me wish I had like an O2 jam game or something like that
994920	1004160	on a, or a DJ Maxx or something like that on the iPhone or iPod, that'd be kind of cool.
1004160	1007160	And yeah, that's pretty much it.
1007160	1010280	I'll get into my gaming week, then I'll let Alan have a shot, although I know he watched
1010280	1013560	me play a lot of this stuff, so maybe he'll want to chime in, I don't know.
1013560	1017240	But I was playing a little bit of Dance Masters, which Logie was kind enough to loan me, and
1017240	1019480	I thought I brought, didn't I put it in the car, I was going to bring it back to him?
1019480	1020480	I don't know.
1020480	1021480	Yeah, you grabbed something.
1021480	1022680	I had no big deal if you didn't.
1022680	1027280	I played a little bit of Dance Masters, which is, is, it's okay.
1027280	1030520	You know, again, I like the look of it a little better than Dance Central.
1030520	1032080	I do really like the look of the game.
1032080	1035800	But the song list, I mean, and I know this sounds kind of cannibalistic, seeing as our
1035800	1039300	show kind of started on the whole DDR thing, but the song list kind of blows.
1039300	1043040	Like there's a few cute songs, especially from the DDR days that are on there.
1043040	1048320	But as far as the Para dances go, I only caught like two Avex songs on there.
1048320	1051960	I mean, all the dances are definitely Para inspired, even the ones that didn't originally
1051960	1053200	come from that game.
1053200	1055280	But I only caught Night of Fire in yesterday.
1055280	1056960	Did you unlock any songs?
1056960	1057960	A few.
1057960	1058960	I haven't done a ton.
1058960	1063920	Because I've seen the full track list and yeah, it's a lot of DDR stuff, but I was just
1063920	1067540	surprised like to see like Afro Nova Primeval on there.
1067540	1069240	Why is it always got to be Primeval?
1069240	1071880	I mean, seriously, why can't you just put the regular Afro Nova?
1071880	1074060	I mean, I don't understand.
1074060	1075680	But the exotic ethnic dance is funny.
1075680	1080460	Well, I know though that a lot of the dances that were in there, you're saying look Para
1080460	1082640	influenced their Tek Para.
1082640	1087160	Well, I know like the exotic ethnic one, if you've ever heard that song is a very like
1087160	1090240	Egyptian kind of sounding song and you do like all these little like walk like an Egyptian
1090240	1092160	moves that are really stupid.
1092160	1095680	But yeah, Loki at the nail on the head, we talked about this game last night or last
1095680	1096680	week.
1096680	1097840	How are you supposed to learn these dances?
1097840	1100440	There's no break it down type of mode or anything.
1100440	1106040	I mean, easy, unlike Dance Central, easy, medium and hard are all the same dance.
1106040	1108840	It's just that you have more you have to hit.
1108840	1112240	So I think that's how it wants you to learn it is that you have to do the silhouettes
1112240	1113240	and easy.
1113240	1116280	And then you have to add some of the circles and medium and then as I think that's how
1116280	1117280	you learn.
1117280	1120640	I'm not sure if it's as effective as Dance Central was.
1120640	1122640	Just watching you play some of those dance master songs.
1122640	1123920	I didn't know how you were doing it.
1123920	1126420	And I know that you were playing them on expert.
1126420	1130120	But I was I mean, I could see you mimicking what was on the screen, but it was so fast.
1130120	1132880	I was like, how are you doing this?
1132880	1135980	Like I could I didn't understand you just memorize it, you memorize dance.
1135980	1139040	It's just the silhouettes is all that you're really mimicking.
1139040	1142040	It's basically learn to Para Para really quickly.
1142040	1145760	Act Definitely in our chat room says Primeval is from Dance Maniacs slash Freaks, which
1145760	1147160	is Para Para-esque.
1147160	1148920	I doubt it would be the same dance, though.
1148920	1151160	I mean, so you got to see what some of these things look like.
1151160	1154720	I just the whole like wax on wax off dancing wouldn't work.
1154720	1156720	There's lots of Sailor Moon sort of salutes.
1156720	1157760	Yeah, there are.
1157760	1159640	There's a lot of cute chibi things in the game.
1159640	1162380	So I mean, and here's the other thing.
1162380	1168800	And I know they've said, you know, numerous times, oh, this time around, we're going to
1168800	1171200	really support download content.
1171200	1172200	Don't see anything yet.
1172200	1173200	Yeah, exactly.
1173200	1175280	Um, I just don't believe them.
1175280	1178000	I mean, at this point, I don't believe them at all, because they said the same thing with
1178000	1179800	Karaoke Revolution.
1179800	1181320	Was there a lot of download content for that?
1181320	1182800	That came out what, a year ago?
1182800	1185840	Yeah, maybe like a couple months, but that's it.
1185840	1189720	I also played a little more Dance Central as Loki did, just trying to do some of the
1189720	1190720	harder dances.
1190720	1192260	And yeah, some of them get pretty funny.
1192260	1196600	I'm sure Alan had a great time watching me do the Come on, Ride the Train dance.
1196600	1198120	I wanted to try that one, but...
1198120	1200280	You actually get to go choo-choo a lot in it.
1200280	1201280	Awesome.
1201280	1202280	Yes, you go choo-choo.
1202280	1204880	And I think Alan was practically pointing and laughing the whole time.
1204880	1205880	It was pretty funny.
1205880	1208640	But yeah, he didn't play.
1208640	1212160	A new Kinect game I tried this week was Kinect Joyride.
1212160	1214320	I played the demo a little bit.
1214320	1216880	Why are you laughing?
1216880	1218600	The color of your car.
1218600	1219600	Oh.
1219600	1224200	Wait, you saw the color of your car thing?
1224200	1225200	That was dumb.
1225200	1228080	It was the most fun I had playing the game.
1228080	1229080	Really?
1229080	1232680	Maybe I don't want to share why, maybe Alan will, but I'm not sharing why it was the most
1232680	1233680	fun part of the game.
1233680	1240240	Well, if it's anything like what we did, then yes, it probably...
1240240	1245040	And it required my wife standing on the couch, but that's another story.
1245040	1250040	No, it's seriously the, you know, it's all pick a color, I'm like, I just want to pick
1250040	1251040	red.
1251040	1253360	I don't want to have to find something red in my house.
1253360	1255280	I just want to pick red.
1255280	1256840	Or pick green.
1256840	1258840	It's all, no, pick something in the camera.
1258840	1262200	And you've seen like, you know, webcams and how they're getting very pixelated and the
1262200	1263360	color's kind of off.
1263360	1265480	Everything ends up being like a palish white.
1265480	1266480	Or pink.
1266480	1267700	Or like purple.
1267700	1270520	No matter whatever the color is.
1270520	1277040	I definitely got a pale pink color.
1277040	1279000	You went for ass pink?
1279000	1281600	Something like that, yeah.
1281600	1285120	Anyhow, so there was that.
1285120	1286920	And then, but then it went black for a second.
1286920	1289600	I just realized it captured my asshole.
1289600	1291360	Anyway, kidding.
1291360	1293960	Except I'm not.
1293960	1295440	Let's see.
1295440	1299640	So yeah, I played Joyride and it was, it was dopey.
1299640	1301000	I didn't like it at all.
1301000	1304200	I thought Mario Kart controlled better on the Wii.
1304200	1307320	Watching you play it, it looked like it had a pretty steep learning curve.
1307320	1310520	Because when it looked, at first couple minutes you were sort of all over the place.
1310520	1312960	And I was like, this game looks like it controls horribly.
1312960	1314760	And you said that it kind of did.
1314760	1318000	But by the end, by like the third or fourth lap, you were reading a lot better.
1318000	1321840	So I just think it has a, it might have a little learning curve to it.
1321840	1322840	I don't know.
1322840	1323840	I just, I did the demo.
1323840	1327400	And granted, I didn't, I only played the demo and I shouldn't base in person with the Game
1327400	1328480	of Demo.
1328480	1333040	But I, the demo did not leave me wanting to get the full game.
1333040	1334200	I got the full game.
1334200	1335200	Did you?
1335200	1336200	Did you like it better than the demo?
1336200	1337200	I actually haven't played the full game yet.
1337200	1339000	I also haven't played Kinect Sports yet.
1339000	1340000	That's the other game that I got.
1340000	1341040	But I haven't played that yet.
1341040	1344200	I'm worried that it's not gonna, it's gonna say, well, sorry, your living room is too
1344200	1345200	small.
1345200	1346200	Again.
1346200	1349280	Um, let's see, what else did I play this week?
1349280	1355040	Um, I was, most, I mean, otherwise the same old stuff, Warcraft, Rock Band 3, I've been
1355040	1356040	playing more of that.
1356040	1358880	I wanna try the Your Shape Fitness demo.
1358880	1360680	Is there a demo on the Adventures disc?
1360680	1361680	Yeah.
1361680	1362680	Oh.
1362680	1366320	If you put the disc in and go to your, um, you know, you can either go in there and play
1366320	1370400	the demo or you can just do it through your actual demo channel thing.
1370400	1374800	Um, so yeah, other than the dance games and that, that was pretty much it.
1374800	1376160	Not a lot of new stuff this week.
1376160	1377680	So maybe, maybe next week.
1377680	1379040	That was, that was the one big game.
1379040	1380840	Otherwise I've been playing the stuff I have.
1380840	1383360	Which is novel for me.
1383360	1386920	Uh, Alan, anything you want to add for your gaming week?
1386920	1389040	Just World of Warcraft.
1389040	1390040	More and more.
1390040	1391840	What's going on in your WoW worlds these days?
1391840	1396280	I've sort of set up these goals for myself to accomplish by the time Cataclysm comes
1396280	1401120	out and they're not necessarily things that are going away when Cataclysm comes out.
1401120	1407000	Um, it's just stuff that, uh, to keep me busy, occupied for the last four weeks.
1407000	1411960	Um, but yeah, I'm trying to get a hundred mounts to get that reward.
1411960	1413800	Good time.
1413800	1416760	Because once it comes out, I'm going to be looking at all the new content and I'm not
1416760	1418680	going to be able to grind all that stupid stuff.
1418680	1420260	So that's what I'm doing now.
1420260	1425080	Is there anything this holiday season that you're looking forward to besides Cataclysm?
1425080	1429200	I haven't really been following the releases because I can't, you know, I usually buy that
1429200	1433120	stuff for myself, so I don't, not following it really.
1433120	1434120	So all right.
1434120	1438360	Well, maybe you can find good deals on last year's holiday releases or just watch Steam.
1438360	1444960	Oh yeah, Steam I'm sure is going to have, you know, eight games for 10 cents or whatever
1444960	1448520	their Christmas sale is and I'll be like, sure, I'll pick up some stuff.
1448520	1449520	Exactly.
1449520	1450520	All right.
1450520	1455120	Anyhow, uh, let's get into some quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's gaming news.
1455120	1457400	Um, not a whole lot of housekeeping tonight.
1457400	1460720	I will just say please join our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange launch radio.
1460720	1465600	Or of course you can follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R. Um, otherwise
1465600	1468480	I don't think I have a whole lot to report tonight.
1468480	1471720	Um, there's a, the spinoff shows, the dark soccer and myself have dark soccer.
1471720	1475880	I host a show called comic insant co-hosts, a show called comic insanity.
1475880	1481920	Uh, just drop the I and you can find them on iTunes and infamous.net.
1481920	1482920	That's right.
1482920	1487160	And uh, the official first episode of the new podcast I'm doing with extra for, if you
1487160	1490760	like Warcraft talk, I would let Alan go on forever, but there's a whole new show for
1490760	1491760	that now.
1491760	1494100	It's a hoard house, the best little hoard house in Azeroth.
1494100	1495100	It's not on iTunes yet.
1495100	1496100	We're trying to get it there.
1496100	1497520	Uh, but more information is available.
1497520	1498720	There's a link on our Twitter.
1498720	1502360	We have a Twitter over there too, twitter.com slash hoard house.
1502360	1504440	So that's our spinoff projects.
1504440	1505600	Probably won't end there.
1505600	1507240	Maybe Loki will get up a side project soon enough.
1507240	1508240	Who knows?
1508240	1509240	And who knows what else is going to happen.
1509240	1510240	Yeah.
1510240	1511240	When am I going to have time for a side project?
1511240	1512240	Seriously.
1512240	1513240	Raising a baby 101.
1513240	1514240	All right.
1514240	1516280	Uh, let's move on with some gaming news.
1516280	1517280	Loki.
1517280	1518280	There's always time for gaming news at least.
1518280	1519280	Yes, there is.
1519280	1524100	Um, of course, you know, the news came out this week that harmonics is being sold by
1524100	1525380	Viacom.
1525380	1528320	The question in everybody's mind is to whom?
1528320	1535560	Um, of course, you know, EA sounds like a likely candidate because for one, they've
1535560	1542360	been publishing their games lately and two, they seem to like snap up, um, you know, popular
1542360	1543360	developers.
1543360	1547840	I mean, they did the same thing with valve and with a bunch of other ones.
1547840	1552400	I mean, they have literally a slew of development houses working on games for them.
1552400	1556720	So, uh, it seems like it might be likely other things that people have thrown out there that
1556720	1561440	might be interesting possible candidates, Microsoft, which would be really interesting
1561440	1562440	if that happened.
1562440	1570280	Um, cause then they would have basically rock band to themselves should be very strange.
1570280	1575560	Um, and then possibly Activision, but God, I hope that doesn't happen.
1575560	1578320	A lot of people in our chat room yelling out Konami.
1578320	1580120	Nah, they don't have enough money.
1580120	1585000	Konami would be bought up by, like, another company, you know, they, I mean, seriously,
1585000	1587840	what big titles do they have coming out each year?
1587840	1591640	Pro Evolution Soccer.
1591640	1592640	That's basically it.
1592640	1597000	I mean, you know, there are other titles, you know, top titles that they have coming
1597000	1598000	out.
1598000	1599800	Yeah, they have a DDR game.
1599800	1604120	By the way, I think Dance Dance Revolution came out this week on PlayStation 3 and Wii.
1604120	1606120	Oh, congrats, I guess.
1606120	1607120	Um, yeah.
1607120	1610240	Uh, that made a big splash.
1610240	1611240	Really?
1611240	1616560	Um, you know, Dance Masters, but those aren't really going to make them a ton of money,
1616560	1617560	I think.
1617560	1620480	Tiger Claws throwing out Ubisoft.
1620480	1622800	I don't know if Ubisoft would do that.
1622800	1626100	I mean, they have their own music stuff, and I don't know if they're big enough to where
1626100	1627640	they'd be purchasing this stuff.
1627640	1630000	If anything, it's probably going to be EA, cause they've got-
1630000	1631180	Okay, X-Link says Atlus.
1631180	1632180	Come on, guys.
1632180	1633180	Now you're just reaching.
1633180	1634180	I don't think-
1634180	1635180	That's just retarded.
1635180	1636180	Squeenix Eidos.
1636180	1637180	Squeenix.
1637180	1639040	Squeenix Eidos Harmonix.
1639040	1640760	Final Fantasy Dance Master, whatever.
1640760	1641760	Oh my gosh.
1641760	1646640	Um, so, other things, you know, you may be concerned because they're being sold and stuff.
1646640	1650040	What's that mean about the download content, um, that's going to be coming out for these
1650040	1651040	games?
1651040	1653360	Well, apparently it's not going to interrupt the download content that's going on.
1653360	1656340	Uh, they've already been working on stuff, and that's not going to be affected by the
1656340	1657340	sale at all.
1657340	1658340	So, uh-
1658340	1660840	They work on that stuff, like, four months out.
1660840	1663600	So, they're set through the holidays, at least.
1663600	1664600	Yeah.
1664600	1667080	So, that's- nothing's really going anywhere there.
1667080	1672040	Um, and then, of course, also, if you are interested in purchasing some new download
1672040	1676200	content for Rock Band 2, you may not be able to do that anymore.
1676200	1686440	In fact, actually, all Rock Band tracks, both DLC and, um, I guess, uh, yeah, just the DLC
1686440	1691120	is actually going to be incompatible with Rock Band 1 and 2.
1691120	1695160	It says apparently the Rock Band Network tracks will be compatible with all versions.
1695160	1699560	So at least you have an avenue for that stuff until, I guess, they update the software for
1699560	1700560	that.
1700560	1703680	Um, so you will need to upgrade to Rock Band 3.
1703680	1705920	Please don't tell me people are bitching about this.
1705920	1710760	Like, are people seriously bitching that, uh, that they're not backwards compatible
1710760	1711760	anymore?
1711760	1712760	Some people, I guess.
1712760	1713760	I don't know.
1713760	1719000	Um, the other thing, too, is they're also adding, um, updates for other tracks, um,
1719000	1720320	old download content.
1720320	1725520	They're adding legacy support to be able to allow you to play those songs with keyboards,
1725520	1728960	uh, pro guitars, uh, pro bass, that kind of stuff.
1728960	1734600	Uh, it's gonna cost you $2 to pay for the new Rock Band 3 version of the songs if you'd
1734600	1737240	like to have keyboard and harmony upgrades.
1737240	1742120	If you want pro guitar, bass versions of those songs, you're gonna need to buy, um, or need
1742120	1746000	to purchase the pro upgrade, which will be for another dollar.
1746000	1750400	So $3 for, um, an upgrade for these songs.
1750400	1754040	Um, and that's each song, by the way.
1754040	1756920	Um, so yeah.
1756920	1759400	It's very interesting stuff.
1759400	1761920	Sorry, I got distracted because I got an email.
1761920	1765320	I'm not allowed to say it because it's under non-disclosure agreement, but I just got into
1765320	1768600	a beta I've been waiting to get into for months and months and months and months, so I'm like
1768600	1769600	eeee.
1769600	1770600	Sorry.
1770600	1771720	Invite, please.
1771720	1775620	If I'm shaking, I'll try, but it's under NDA, so I can't say anything more about it,
1775620	1778520	but I'm, um, shaking and crying over here.
1778520	1779520	My bad.
1779520	1780520	I'm sorry, I know everybody hates that.
1780520	1783480	I know something you don't know, guy, but that's why I'm distracted.
1783480	1785480	I'm just telling y'all I have an excuse.
1785480	1786480	I have a very good excuse.
1786480	1787480	Is it for Naughty Bear 2?
1787480	1788480	I know.
1788480	1795320	Yes, it's for Naughty Bear 2, okay, now they're gonna boot me, I'm so, so sad.
1795320	1796560	It's for Final Fantasy XIV.
1796560	1799120	Oh wait, I'm sorry, that's just a regular subscription.
1799120	1802040	No, that's just called buying the PC version.
1802040	1805480	I like how they, this one didn't make their show roll or whatever, but I like how they
1805480	1809920	came out and said, yeah, we understand that the game's terrible.
1809920	1811240	We're working on it, though.
1811240	1817000	It's like, that doesn't excuse the fact that you put the game out and it's terrible.
1817000	1822360	Um, so I wanted to say also about the developer situation and Harmonix getting sold and all
1822360	1825240	that stuff, I don't think this is quite the end of the world, I think some people are
1825240	1826240	making it out to be.
1826240	1827240	No.
1827240	1829760	Harmonix is still, I mean, they are very well respected in the industry.
1829760	1830880	They do a lot of great stuff.
1830880	1835600	I do think losing the relationship with MTV Games is gonna be a bummer for them because
1835600	1838960	I think that's part of what's pushed that Rock Band DLC to the next level, but let's
1838960	1845600	face it, Rock Band DLC has always been, like, above and beyond like any other game and their
1845600	1846600	supported DLC.
1846600	1849560	And it's a household name now, I don't really think that people need to convince, you know,
1849560	1853240	they don't need the MTV backing to convince bands to be in Rock Band.
1853240	1854240	Yeah.
1854240	1860840	I mean, they have plenty of history and plenty of, you know, data to show them, hey, look,
1860840	1865400	you'll see DLC on this, you know, cells and you'll make some money or, you know, it's
1865400	1866400	worthwhile.
1866400	1867400	So.
1867400	1871720	Um, yeah, so, I don't think it's the end of the world for them.
1871720	1877200	I don't know if we'll hear much through this holiday season, but, you know, I don't know
1877200	1880680	if we'll hear about a change of hands just before Christmas, but I think probably in
1880680	1881680	the new year.
1881680	1884440	But I wouldn't, I wouldn't say Doom and Gloom for the Rock Band franchise yet.
1884440	1886240	I think it'll still sell well through the holidays, too.
1886240	1888920	I can't believe people are already saying this game is a sales failure.
1888920	1892840	People have been saying before these games even came out, they've been saying music games
1892840	1893840	are over.
1893840	1896680	Music games will never be over.
1896680	1897680	People are dumb.
1897680	1901140	They're like, well, I can't take it to the plastic instrument.
1901140	1905440	You don't have to fucking buy another plastic instrument for every goddamn game that comes
1905440	1906440	out.
1906440	1909240	Why are you buying multiple plastic instruments for these things?
1909240	1913880	Um, music games might not be the next big fad anymore, but music games are a long way
1913880	1915520	from going out.
1915520	1918840	We'll always have Glee.
1918840	1923400	It's things like Glee that will kill different franchises for certain people, like, you know.
1923400	1927360	Well, isn't it kind of sad that it was probably Activision saturating the market that ruined
1927360	1930440	it for, you know, because most people can't tell the difference between guitar hero and
1930440	1931440	rock band.
1931440	1932440	I don't think it really ruined it for anybody.
1932440	1933440	I mean, people can see through.
1933440	1938760	If there's a lot of games coming out, say, for guitar hero or whatever, I mean, sure
1938760	1942840	people get jaded about the fact that, you know, oh, they're just out for money.
1942840	1947040	And you know, Green Day Rock Band kind of seemed like, oh, they're out for money.
1947040	1951640	You know, instead of saying, oh, it's the Green Day Rock Band track pack or something
1951640	1952640	like that.
1952640	1955600	And, you know, they used to do track packs where they'd put stuff out and there'd be
1955600	1960320	some download content that you could get and play, you know, before, you know, it hits
1960320	1963080	the, you know, service or whatever.
1963080	1966800	Or you could play these games, you know, standalone by themselves and, you know, it's like twenty
1966800	1970320	bucks for a game versus, you know, full price.
1970320	1975480	Rama in our chat room is asking, Loki, question, do you think that the music games are declining?
1975480	1978480	Are they declining?
1978480	1979560	I don't think so.
1979560	1981080	I mean, I think...
1981080	1985560	I think Rock Band 3, sorry, I'm cutting you off and interjecting my own answer, but whatever.
1985560	1989800	Rock Band 3 is definitely a step above Rock Band 2 and it's a worthy upgrade.
1989800	1993100	DJ Hero 2 is a worthy step above DJ Hero 1.
1993100	1999040	I think maybe there might be room to do something more original, but at the same time, don't
1999040	2001440	put another plastic instrument in my house.
2001440	2007800	Yeah, and that being said, also though, you know, Rock Band 3 did introduce the keyboards,
2007800	2010000	which I don't see that as a bad thing.
2010000	2015600	It's not like we're, you know, first off, it's not required that you have a keyboard.
2015600	2017860	If it's something that you want, then you can pick it up.
2017860	2022080	You don't need to necessarily go and buy, you know, some brand new stuff.
2022080	2025140	And the instruments that they released this year, because they do have standalone instruments
2025140	2030360	for Rock Band 3, they're not really, other than the pro, you know, the pro guitar that
2030360	2035360	they have out there, and then the guitar that's a real guitar, other than those optional instruments,
2035360	2038360	all the instruments are the same.
2038360	2043480	Dan was just saying today how he wanted the wireless Logitech guitar controller.
2043480	2044480	What for?
2044480	2045480	Just for- For Rock Band?
2045480	2046800	No, he wants it.
2046800	2047800	Okay.
2047800	2052660	The higher quality, better made, but he pointed it out and said, this is what I want.
2052660	2056860	So I think that the whole plastic instrument thing argument can go right down the toilet
2056860	2060240	because an enthusiast is gonna buy them.
2060240	2061240	I have a guitar.
2061240	2065680	I have a Fender guitar that's actually a wood guitar that's made for Rock Band.
2065680	2071720	It was a $300 guitar at one time, got it for a third of the price, but it's pretty awesome.
2071720	2076040	Let me ask this question when you guys talk about music games dying and all this stuff.
2076040	2079520	Would you consider Child of Eden a music game?
2079520	2080520	No.
2080520	2082680	I never really consider Child of Eden.
2082680	2085520	No, you know what I'm talking about, or is it Children of Eden?
2085520	2086960	I've never really considered it.
2086960	2087960	And I have that preordered.
2087960	2089380	I cannot wait to get that game.
2089380	2094400	But Children of Eden, you know, the rezzy- Yeah, but I never considered it.
2094400	2095400	Like you never- you don't want to buy it?
2095400	2096920	You're not interested in it at all?
2096920	2100280	No, just- I keep forgetting about it because I have a lot of other stuff going on.
2100280	2103880	Well, it's not also gonna be out this year anyway.
2103880	2107360	Yeah, it's like I haven't really bothered to think about it until it comes an option
2107360	2108720	for me to be able to get.
2108720	2112780	Well, the reason why I'm throwing that out there is because maybe we're looking at an
2112780	2116980	evolution of music games or something new, and I think that's just what the music game
2116980	2120180	genre needs is something new that's interesting.
2120180	2127840	And this whole connect slash move slash, you know, whatever, 3DS even, is, you know, could
2127840	2130600	bring us kind of the next interesting thing in gaming.
2130600	2134040	But as far as the whole plastic guitars and drums, I think there's only so much you can
2134040	2138960	do with that, and it's really hard to surpass what Rock Band 3 is bringing to the table.
2138960	2142080	It is, and that's- And honestly, Rock Band 3's features aren't
2142080	2143080	for everyone.
2143080	2148880	That's, and it's basically the response, you know, both companies, both Harmonix and both
2148880	2153960	Activision, understand that, you know, maybe their sales are taking a hit a little bit
2153960	2159840	and the music games aren't exactly as, I should say, not necessarily as popular, but aren't
2159840	2164800	making as big of a splash anymore as, you know, they were previously.
2164800	2168880	And with Rock Band, though, they haven't really been trying to put out tons of releases.
2168880	2172480	I mean, the Green Day thing was kind of a one-off thing, and then the Beatles, that
2172480	2176640	was kind of something different, where it was mainly, that was just gonna be all-inclusive
2176640	2177640	in it.
2177640	2180960	And yeah, I know they had the Lego Rock Band game, but that was more of a grab to try to
2180960	2182480	get the family audience in there.
2182480	2184120	It also wasn't Harmonix.
2184120	2189240	Well, they developed it, but it was Warner Brothers, yeah, that published it.
2189240	2193680	I thought another developer kind of took the Rock Band code and did it.
2193680	2194680	Yeah, I know what you mean.
2194680	2195680	You're Traveler's Hills, yeah.
2195680	2196680	Yeah, yeah.
2196680	2197680	That's it.
2197680	2198680	But anyways.
2198680	2200000	But that game had an awesome soundtrack, and I, you know-
2200000	2203240	I'm actually trying to find a copy of Lego Rock Band for super cheap.
2203240	2206640	I think I could just order it on Amazon for, like, 14 bucks, just to get the songs in my
2206640	2207640	Rock Band 3 collection.
2207640	2208720	It really is worth it.
2208720	2211920	But other than that, I mean, they've kind of taken it two different routes.
2211920	2215560	You know, Guitar Hero decided this year that they're gonna go back to their roots.
2215560	2223880	They said to make it all about rock, and that's cool and all, and they had a decent tracklist
2223880	2229040	and stuff like that, but it's not, like, that big a deal.
2229040	2233480	I mean, if you like the songs, cool, and you can buy them and, you know, upgrade and stuff
2233480	2238280	like that, but it's not like it's adding new ways to play the game other than this quest
2238280	2242800	mode that- and they had, like, challenges per songs and stuff like that, download content.
2242800	2246520	That's neat, but it's just- it doesn't seem like a lot worse.
2246520	2252240	Rock Band 3, they went ahead, added new instruments, new pro modes, new lessons and stuff like
2252240	2257460	that, you know, harmonies, just a bunch of stuff to it.
2257460	2260880	And plus it has a library of thousands of songs.
2260880	2264200	Let me throw this out there, too, speaking of this whole, like, next evolution of the
2264200	2267760	music-based game and so forth, is, you know, think about this, too.
2267760	2269820	I think you have to consider this a music game.
2269820	2273840	What is the number one Kinect title gonna be this holiday season, besides Kinect Adventures,
2273840	2274840	the pack-in game?
2274840	2275840	Dance Central.
2275840	2276840	It's gonna be Dance Central.
2276840	2281160	Dance Central made by Harmonics, so, you know, that's gonna be a big thing for them, I think,
2281160	2285280	and you know, even if not everybody is into dancing, it just shows you there are other
2285280	2287040	things that haven't been done yet that can't be done.
2287040	2288880	We've already got download content for it.
2288880	2289880	No.
2289880	2290880	Alright.
2290880	2291880	Anyway, let's move on.
2291880	2295280	Sorry, I don't want to spend too much time on this, but, you know, we have a soft spot
2295280	2297680	for music-based games here at OLR, so.
2297680	2302400	Speaking of the Kinect, though, this is somewhat interesting slash exciting, a new open source
2302400	2304840	Kinect camera driver has been released.
2304840	2309840	So, you know, ever since the Kinect came out, it's been everybody's job to try and hack
2309840	2314640	it slash crack it, although some people have criticized me, like, earlier this evening
2314640	2318880	about my usage of that term, whatever you want to call it.
2318880	2324680	People are using the Kinect for their own purposes on the PC.
2324680	2330080	A hacker by the name of Hector Martin has managed to do basically what the NUI groups
2330080	2334960	Alex P announced that they did, the whole Kinect functionality versus the PC.
2334960	2340640	Martin released his code out to the public, so you can actually see what that looks like
2340640	2341860	when you're running it there.
2341860	2345880	They have, like, a little YouTube up right there, and you can, all it does right now
2345880	2352240	is it displays what the Kinect quote unquote sees right now, kind of using little RGB.
2352240	2354800	It looks like one of those, like, thermal cams, when you're kind of looking at what
2354800	2355800	it sees.
2355800	2359960	So, very interesting that the driver is out there.
2359960	2364440	Kind of strange that if this will run on a PC, which, since it's USB, I think we all
2364440	2367880	figured it would, kind of interesting that Microsoft just didn't try to jump on it for
2367880	2368880	its own purposes.
2368880	2373440	I mean, why would Microsoft pigeonhole the Kinect for, well, I guess it makes sense,
2373440	2375280	because they want to sell more 360s.
2375280	2378480	But now that this is kind of out there, why doesn't Microsoft take advantage of this for
2378480	2383400	their own purposes and try to put out Kinect PC games and fitness-type games for the PC?
2383400	2384400	I don't know.
2384400	2385400	Am I crazy?
2385400	2390720	So, anyhow, also something to throw out there is that there is now a Homebrew PC Kinect
2390720	2392820	photo app that is out there.
2392820	2397540	It's by the coder Flowemuc, Flowemuc?
2397540	2402040	It's a proof of concept, what they call application, and there's another YouTube video out there
2402040	2408480	using Kinect to track the hand movements, manipulating, resizing photos.
2408480	2414360	He has not released the software yet, but it's out there on YouTube, so there it is.
2414360	2417400	And this is all done within the course of a few weeks, so imagine what we're going to
2417400	2421120	be looking at early next year, as far as PC Homebrew stuff goes.
2421120	2426080	I guess people have more free time than I do, anyway.
2426080	2428400	Hey, you know what, though?
2428400	2432520	Better your free time on this than, I don't know, World of Warcraft.
2432520	2433520	Says the addict.
2433520	2435840	Or Star Trek Online.
2435840	2437520	Which I play maybe once a week.
2437520	2439520	Okay, justify, justify, justify.
2439520	2441600	For 18 hours at a stretch.
2441600	2442600	No.
2442600	2445280	More like one or two.
2445280	2448640	Mr. I have scheduled raids on Wednesday.
2448640	2450360	This week, we'll see.
2450360	2451360	Scheduled raids.
2451360	2453920	Hanging out with friends, I know them all in real life.
2453920	2454920	Scheduled raids.
2454920	2455920	Almost.
2455920	2458560	And we can also go out for pizza together.
2458560	2462280	I didn't go this last- why am I justifying this to you?
2462280	2464280	I don't care!
2464280	2466280	Screw you!
2466280	2468800	Judge, judge, judge.
2468800	2472200	Well, how about Nintendo?
2472200	2475120	This is almost douchey, but not quite.
2475120	2478320	They trademarked the phrase, it's on like Donkey Kong.
2478320	2485200	Sorry, SSJ100Matt said in chat, I don't know, JB did play Second Life.
2485200	2486680	I do love the chatters.
2486680	2491320	Oh yeah, Donkey Kong, hey!
2491320	2496760	Well, Nintendo owns the phrase now, and pretty much it's gonna be because of Donkey Kong
2496760	2500160	Country Returns on November 21st.
2500160	2503400	Their catchphrase, on November 21st, it's on like Donkey Kong.
2503400	2505240	So they had to trademark the phrase.
2505240	2508640	I thought that had to be approved and all that stuff by the government first, like they're-
2508640	2512120	Well, they filed the request.
2512120	2514680	And apparently, I guess they got it.
2514680	2520080	It's Nintendo's phrase now.
2520080	2522440	So now I'm just gonna say it's on like Pong.
2522440	2527800	Well, I mean, like, I don't even like that saying, to be honest.
2527800	2533120	No matter where this kind of argument stands, like, I don't even use the phrase, it's on
2533120	2535000	like Donkey Kong, because you know what?
2535000	2538320	When it comes to my gaming on the Wii, it's off.
2538320	2541040	Like I- it's unplugged, actually.
2541040	2543360	Mine has a layer of dust on it right now.
2543360	2546400	Yeah, it's sitting in a box somewhere.
2546400	2550800	I've been playing a lot of stuff on my iPhone.
2550800	2554600	So yeah, I mean, have fun, I guess, with the trademark.
2554600	2559600	But I guess if they want to sell shirts or whatever- Didn't the Scott Pilgrim movie use
2559600	2563640	that in like their trailers and the posters and stuff?
2563640	2568960	Maybe that's what they were trying to do is, although it's kind of ironic, because it kind
2568960	2572520	of comes full circle, because there was the whole King Kong thing from Universal, and
2572520	2575880	Universal has the Scott Pilgrim- well, forget it.
2575880	2579320	It's actually not that interesting at all.
2579320	2582160	I'm just rolling my eyes.
2582160	2583160	They just want to sell t-shirts.
2583160	2584160	Yeah.
2584160	2585160	So they're just waiting.
2585160	2586160	Yeah.
2586160	2587160	Damn them.
2587160	2588160	So.
2588160	2589160	It's off.
2589160	2590160	I don't care.
2590160	2597600	You can say it's on like Tron, that makes more sense, because Tron is cooler than Donkey
2597600	2598600	Kong.
2598600	2599600	It's on like Tron?
2599600	2600600	It rhymes!
2600600	2604960	Donkey Kong Country was an awesome game.
2604960	2611100	It is an awesome game, and I like how the new game is like, you know, just like the
2611100	2617280	old games, you know, they didn't really try to change it up too much, I guess, hoping
2617280	2621640	to catch the new Super Mario Brothers crowd, I'm guessing.
2621640	2625880	Act F in our chat room says, and numerous people are referencing this in chat too, Act
2625880	2629960	F says, Sky, yeah, the Scott Pilgrim trailers use that phrase.
2629960	2634040	Don't kid yourself, that's what this is really about.
2634040	2638640	This isn't, this isn't, uh, never mind.
2638640	2642280	So we talk about stupid Donkey Kong, that's what it was about.
2642280	2643280	And we did.
2643280	2644280	Well it worked!
2644280	2648320	It was on like CNN, and MSNBC, and like every frickin' news station ran with it.
2648320	2653880	I feel terrible for contributing to the promotion of that game, so I'm just not gonna buy it.
2653880	2654880	Alright.
2654880	2659680	Oh wait, I was gonna not buy it anyway, so that's so funny!
2659680	2667680	A game that people purchased a lot of recently, not Call of Duty, because Call of Duty did
2667680	2673160	sell a lot as well, but it took Fallout New Vegas just a little bit longer.
2673160	2679920	They did sell five million units as well, and I guess, combined I guess with a heavy
2679920	2687800	volume of digital downloads, the game stands to generate 300 million dollars in sales.
2687800	2693840	And it says, of course, that they are working to patch the game to fix the numerous bugs
2693840	2696840	that were in there.
2696840	2705520	Whatever, you know, we can rant on and on about how games get released, unfinished,
2705520	2712120	just so that they can sell them and have people test them, whatever.
2712120	2715360	So there's gonna be a PC patch coming out soon, I think there was already a patch that's
2715360	2721320	in the works for the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions.
2721320	2725600	Breakman in our chat room is asking, is Fallout New Vegas fixed yet, kind of I guess a reference
2725600	2727840	to the story, because that game is broken as fuck, is the quote.
2727840	2729240	It's not fixed yet.
2729240	2731440	But it will be soon, don't worry.
2731440	2734080	You know, you're just gonna have a broken game for a while.
2734080	2735760	How broken is broken as fuck?
2735760	2739760	Is it seriously like we're talking no boss shows up on level 30?
2739760	2744080	They're having save issues, where I think save games are getting erased.
2744080	2745520	Oh, that sucks.
2745520	2748000	Is it Cogwheel cursor broken?
2748000	2750640	Nice, nice reference.
2750640	2752600	Wow reference, sorry.
2752600	2759100	They're also doing some tweaks for Nvidia graphics card users, and I guess there's some
2759100	2762480	problems with the Havok drivers.
2762480	2766840	Casey in our chat room at chat.org.com says, yeah right, you already bought it, why fix
2766840	2768320	it?
2768320	2773640	They will, I trust that they will, I mean Fallout 3 I think was kind of the same issue,
2773640	2775880	they'll have the same issues where it was buggy.
2775880	2780000	And you know, even like with Oblivion and stuff, they had a lot of buggy stuff in there
2780000	2781000	that they went and patched.
2781000	2785800	I mean, those games are pretty complex, but once again that's still no excuse for testing
2785800	2787320	your games.
2787320	2793040	But I understand why they release it when they do, because you know, especially towards
2793040	2798880	the holidays, getting your game to a duplicator to get it done, I mean there's such a backlog
2798880	2805040	with duplicators right now that you have to release it then in order to make it out before
2805040	2807280	Call of Duty comes out.
2807280	2814160	But still though, I mean, put a little bit more effort into, you know, testing your games
2814160	2815680	for bugs.
2815680	2820800	Alright, well, hopefully these games have been very well tested for bugs.
2820800	2823680	It's actually a follow up to something we were talking about last week, it's the indie
2823680	2824680	games.
2824680	2827840	You remember how indie games on Xbox Live, they were kind of shoved under the rug a little
2827840	2829720	bit and people were pissed.
2829720	2834280	Well, what's interesting is that it's been fixed already, and when I say fixed I mean
2834280	2838880	pretty much moved back sort of to where it was before.
2838880	2843560	It's now under the games and demos section of the Xbox Live marketplace.
2843560	2847840	So yeah, and there was no dashboard update or anything, so they must have done all that
2847840	2850360	updating on the server end somehow.
2850360	2855360	So yeah, some interesting feedback in the Microsoft forums, there's of course celebrating
2855360	2856360	going on.
2856360	2860960	Microsoft is listening, indie games are back in the games section, we are having an effect.
2860960	2864440	The new placement isn't perfect, because they want to be front and center, but it's a huge
2864440	2865760	step in the right direction.
2865760	2869840	The icon feels very out of place being such a different style and in searches and so forth.
2869840	2873580	It doesn't look like indie games are included, but we are in the games section.
2873580	2879820	So congrats, they're back, and you know, it seems like a logical place for them to be,
2879820	2881920	and I can see why they were kind of mad the first time.
2881920	2887560	But what's also very interesting, not only is it that, there's now going to be this developer
2887560	2892960	led initiative going on called Indie Games Winter Uprising.
2892960	2897320	It's not quite the same thing that you would think as like Summer of Arcade, because it's
2897320	2899520	not Microsoft sponsoring this.
2899520	2905240	This is actually a developer enabled thing, but they're going to actually price over a
2905240	2910340	dozen games and indie games between 80 to 400 Microsoft points.
2910340	2914000	So the developers are going to take a hit to try and bring more notice to the indie
2914000	2915000	games.
2915000	2916000	Which means Microsoft takes a cut too.
2916000	2921560	But a lot of the indie games are already 80 Microsoft points to 400 Microsoft points.
2921560	2924400	So it's not like they're really going to be doing anything.
2924400	2929780	Well supposedly these are like big indie titles, I mean I'm not sure exactly what that means.
2929780	2934200	But yeah, 80 to 400 Microsoft points during the first week of December.
2934200	2937520	But you know, what's kind of sad about this though is that how are people going to know
2937520	2941920	about this outside of I guess gaming blogs and maybe the gaming hardcore if something
2941920	2943680	is not mentioned on the Microsoft dashboard.
2943680	2948760	I mean it's kind of a bummer that Microsoft won't say, hey good idea, let's put a little
2948760	2951360	banner or something or you know.
2951360	2954760	And I think that's kind of what the developers want is they just want Microsoft to throw
2954760	2955760	them a bone.
2955760	2957400	It's not like Microsoft ain't making money on it.
2957400	2959920	Yeah but the problem with these developers though is they're pissed off that there's
2959920	2964880	a lot of like cheap crappy games like all these massage apps and stuff like that.
2964880	2966960	Hey Babymaker Extreme is awesome.
2966960	2971920	But you know what, you just need to suck it up and get over it because that's what there
2971920	2976040	is on the stupid Apple app store and stuff like that.
2976040	2980200	Just you have to differentiate your product and I understand there's a lot of massage
2980200	2981200	apps.
2981200	2983040	But people are buying them sadly.
2983040	2987800	Unless you're making a massage app, who gives a crap what other massage apps are out there?
2987800	2992160	And yes I understand that people are dumb and will buy a lot of them and rate it up
2992160	2996920	or whatever and it'll appear at the top of some you know top sellers list and they'll
2996920	3002680	just you know keep regurgitating the cycle I guess of bad purchases.
3002680	3007880	But you need to do something other than just upload your game and be done with it.
3007880	3009840	You need to go market your game.
3009840	3014440	You can't just expect people to purchase the game, rate it high and hope that it appears
3014440	3017840	at this top list because there's a lot of games coming out.
3017840	3022040	I don't ever get contacted by indie developers on this show save for the ones you've already
3022040	3026440	heard on this program in the past like YYR and a couple others.
3026440	3032440	But you know I'm just saying indie developers maybe you need to aim a little lower to like
3032440	3039240	and I'm not like stop trying to go for the big big coverage and come to like indie shows
3039240	3040480	and things like that.
3040480	3045320	I will happily have indie developers on the one to pimp their games just send us an email.
3045320	3047520	Know what I mean?
3047520	3051480	There's plenty of outlets for them to do that kind of stuff.
3051480	3054640	So we'll see what happens.
3054640	3057480	Dark Soccer what do you have for us before we get into the release dates and then the
3057480	3059200	classic end of the week is not that far away either.
3059200	3063000	Oh I was making fun of somebody for being wrong on the contest because they didn't listen
3063000	3064560	to all the instructions.
3064560	3065560	Aww.
3065560	3068680	Sorry you lose.
3068680	3074800	Well Scribblenauts is getting a Japanese release and it's actually just the first one not Super
3074800	3080720	Scribblenauts and it's called Flash Puzzle Maxwell's Peculiar Notebook.
3080720	3086000	Or into the Peculiar it could be mysterious it's Fushigi.
3086000	3089320	I love that word Fushigi anyway.
3089320	3096200	So yeah they are have had to change the 22,000 word dictionary and it's going to be a budget
3096200	3098640	release on top of that I mean.
3098640	3099640	Interesting.
3099640	3100640	Yeah.
3100640	3106680	But the speculation is that they're already working on localizing the sequel as well.
3106680	3113320	No word on if it's being changed as far as aesthetically cosmetically.
3113320	3117720	Now when you say localized you mean they are changing as well all of the like words and
3117720	3121000	things to be in Japanese language.
3121000	3122400	Localizing it for Japan.
3122400	3124360	That has got to be a pain in the ass.
3124360	3131180	Oh yes because I honestly think there's going to have to be more universal memes there used.
3131180	3133480	What alphabet are they going to use?
3133480	3137040	I would expect that they're going to use the...
3137040	3138680	What's that it's Kanji and Katakana?
3138680	3142160	I think they're going to use all of them I would hope.
3142160	3143840	Probably use the...
3143840	3148480	You know how with the iPhone you can actually just type it in either way and it will bring
3148480	3151560	up the Kanji dictionary that will let you pick which one.
3151560	3155840	Or like using the Shift Jest translate changer on Windows.
3155840	3156840	Oh okay.
3156840	3157840	Yeah.
3157840	3159960	I would expect it would work the same way.
3159960	3163440	I wonder if Lolcats are going to be in it and all the other internet memes or if they
3163440	3166040	kind of took those out because maybe it's not quite the same.
3166040	3167040	President Kat!
3167040	3171200	Yeah they should put President Kat in the game that would be awesome.
3171200	3173800	But I'm not going to hold my breath.
3173800	3178200	Let's travel around the world and look at some releases coming soon to a store near
3178200	3179200	you.
3179200	3180200	We'll start in the US.
3180200	3181200	Loki.
3181200	3184360	Still keeping up with lots of releases coming out and I think this is probably going to
3184360	3187860	be the last big week and it's going to start dying down.
3187860	3193080	Today actually was the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini Land Mayhem on the Nintendo
3193080	3194080	DS.
3194080	3197280	Also this Sunday there was also You Draw.
3197280	3201840	Hold on is that that same puzzle game series that started a long time ago on the Game Boy
3201840	3202840	Advance?
3202840	3203840	The Mario vs. Donkey Kong games?
3203840	3204840	Yeah the ones like Lemons.
3204840	3205840	Wow.
3205840	3206840	I never realized that was such a huge series.
3206840	3209120	Well, tell it Nintendo.
3209120	3211640	They don't seem to understand.
3211640	3213440	Wasn't a bad game the first time.
3213440	3217320	It wasn't a bad game but I mean I could think of them developing some other games though
3217320	3218440	that might not be so bad.
3218440	3219440	Well if they're selling.
3219440	3221040	People like Mario games.
3221040	3222720	I mean standard Mario games.
3222720	3223720	You don't have to go.
3223720	3224720	It's on like Mario.
3224720	3226720	Don't have to go too crazy.
3226720	3229320	Some people like myself may like Mario RPG.
3229320	3231640	Just a thought.
3231640	3232640	You Draw.
3232640	3237680	They're coming out with the tablet plus the drawing software and then Dude's Big Adventure
3237680	3242840	which is some doodling platformer game and Pictionary because everyone loves Pictionary.
3242840	3244400	And then of course Pictionary for the DS.
3244400	3245400	So that's all today.
3245400	3251640	And then of course this week we have NBA Jam coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 for
3251640	3255640	the almost full price of $50 instead of $60.
3255640	3256640	Okay.
3256640	3259040	It's $10 cheaper.
3259040	3264200	Sims 3 for the Wii kind of delayed from the rest of the other console versions.
3264200	3273260	Marvel Superhero Squad the Infinity Gauntlet on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, I concur.
3273260	3274260	It's terrible.
3274260	3279680	It's like Mario, Marvel Superhero Babies or something like that.
3279680	3286640	National Geographic Challenge Wildlife on Playstation 3 and Wii.
3286640	3292920	Pac-Man Party, ugh, that's coming out on the Wii.
3292920	3297040	Barbie Grooming Glam Pups on the Wii and DS.
3297040	3300320	Is there a single listener of Orange Launch Radio that's going to be picking up Barbie
3300320	3302680	Grooming Glam Pups?
3302680	3303680	No but it is.
3303680	3306840	Why do we list them on the release dates?
3306840	3308480	Because they're coming out, okay?
3308480	3310240	I don't care about all of these titles.
3310240	3312000	Well maybe it should stay in.
3312000	3316760	People go to jail over protesting cosmetic use on animals and you have a game where you
3316760	3318640	have to put mascara on a dog or something.
3318640	3322360	I don't even want to know what that game involves.
3322360	3328000	You Gave Your Cat a Perm, 20 points.
3328000	3331160	That's pretty much the Chocobo game on Facebook.
3331160	3333440	Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii.
3333440	3338080	Yes that's not confusing at all, just repeating the title because oh yeah it's going back
3338080	3340320	to its roots I guess.
3340320	3344880	Will that work as well as it did on Kariok Revolution, the game that everybody forgot
3344880	3347760	was even out there that you said you were going to support with download content but
3347760	3348760	never did?
3348760	3351400	Yeah, I thought so.
3351400	3353120	Namco Museum Megamix.
3353120	3357040	It's more Namco arcade games for the Wii.
3357040	3359120	Split second on PSP this week.
3359120	3363200	Apache Air Assault on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
3363200	3371680	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and I believe PC as well.
3371680	3376240	We'll skip past all this crap since you don't want to talk about iCarly 2.
3376240	3381200	iCarly, I believe it's I Join the Click.
3381200	3382560	I think that's what it was called.
3382560	3385000	I Stab Myself.
3385000	3390840	And then I Told You, I don't know if I mentioned this last week, but reload target down on
3390840	3391840	the Wii.
3391840	3393640	It's a target shooting game.
3393640	3397680	That's right, you don't actually kill real people in it.
3397680	3398960	That's terrible.
3398960	3399960	What's the point?
3399960	3400960	Yes, exactly.
3400960	3408720	Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon on the Wii, Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2011, god I don't
3408720	3409720	care.
3409720	3415240	Oh yeah Dance Dance Revolution on Playstation 3 as well with the move support, oooh.
3415240	3419320	EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp.
3419320	3421320	That's a hundred bucks by the way.
3421320	3424040	That's coming out on the Wii.
3424040	3425720	Hello Kitty Seasons on the Wii.
3425720	3428040	What does that come with to justify the hundred dollar price?
3428040	3431880	Does it come with one of those full training dummies that you slam into to try and tackle
3431880	3432880	for your living room?
3432880	3438600	No, they actually do have, it's a set of wireless sensors, they've got a pedometer, some sort
3438600	3443480	of thing built in, it's a bunch of sensors and what not, heart rate monitors.
3443480	3444920	For your ass.
3444920	3449760	For your ass, yes that's right, cause your ass has its own heart.
3449760	3456080	Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, that's on the Nintendo DS this week, why'd you even
3456080	3457080	ask?
3457080	3465240	Harry, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Spartan 1, that's coming out on PS3, Xbox
3465240	3473800	360, Wii, DS, PC, and I believe the Xbox 360 version, you can cast spells with the Kinect,
3473800	3474800	oooh.
3474800	3480040	Wii Sports Active 2.0, that's also a hundred bucks each, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii,
3480040	3484400	and on top of all that, you need the Move, or Kinect, well then the Wii, you just need
3484400	3486400	the Wii stuff.
3486400	3490240	That's expensive all around.
3490240	3494280	Other fun stuff this week, and there is some fun stuff, and this is pretty awesome, Need
3494280	3502080	for Speed Hot Pursuit, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and this is from
3502080	3507640	Criterion, I mean the guy's behind the Burnout series, so you know it's gonna be good.
3507640	3516320	Sonic Colors on the Wii and Nintendo DS, and then there's this game called Create, which
3516320	3521520	is from EA, it's, they're trying to make it like some sort of little big planet thing,
3521520	3523640	but really it's not.
3523640	3534000	That's on PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and, and finally rounding things
3534000	3541560	out here, Zumba Fitness, it's some Latin dance exercise thing, I keep seeing infomercials
3541560	3547320	for early in the morning, because I have to get up with the baby, Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation
3547320	3550840	3, and of course those do support the Move and Kinect.
3550840	3555400	Deck of Sports Freedom, that is a Kinect game that's based off that Wii game that they put
3555400	3560440	out, and then finally, I'm told those Deck of Sports games do really well.
3560440	3564840	They do actually, and they're not too terrible, remember we played Deck of Sports 1, yeah
3564840	3570280	because it had curling, which made it the best, figure skating, made it the best, oh
3570280	3573680	I hope they have figure skating on the Kinect, that would be tons of fun to do in that living
3573680	3574680	room.
3574680	3576040	I don't think they have figure skating, but they have some other stuff.
3576040	3578720	I could be my own Brian Boitano.
3578720	3581220	And then Pro Evolution Soccer 2011.
3581220	3582220	And that's it.
3582220	3584120	That was on the Wii, of course.
3584120	3589220	Looking in our chatroom at chat.orangessontrady.com, Frisbee says, speaking of worthless, what
3589220	3590880	ever happened to the Vitality sensor?
3590880	3594000	Good question.
3594000	3595000	Never came out.
3595000	3596000	Okay.
3596000	3597480	Maybe that'll be the big thing in X-T3.
3597480	3602040	Well if you remember though, Ubisoft does have their own version of that that's on PC
3602040	3606120	though, remember that, I don't remember the hell it was called, but it was just like,
3606120	3608720	okay, breathe in and out.
3608720	3609720	Breathe in and out of the game.
3609720	3610720	No, we relax, right?
3610720	3611720	Or whatever.
3611720	3612720	I don't know.
3612720	3613720	It wasn't real.
3613720	3614720	Breathe the game.
3614720	3615720	I like to breathe.
3615720	3620560	Alright, let's go to our Japanese release dates, hooray.
3620560	3625640	Call of Duty Black Ops gets a subtitle edition released in Japan this week on November 18th.
3625640	3631840	EA Sports MMA, The Sims 3, Crossboard 7, and Dance Evolution all as well come out this
3631840	3635080	week on the Xbox 360.
3635080	3637640	In fact, I think this is the big week for Kinect in Japan.
3637640	3641040	November 20th is their launch day over there, so it's about what, six days away?
3641040	3643240	20 is an important number.
3643240	3644240	Is it?
3644240	3645240	Yes it is.
3645240	3646240	Oh, 20 November, get it?
3646240	3649200	They're getting Dance Evolution on 20 November.
3649200	3651200	Tell me that's not a coincidence.
3651200	3653680	Alright, so yeah, those are all those releases.
3653680	3657160	So some of the Kinect games, I guess I should read some of these other Kinect games that
3657160	3658160	are coming out in Japan.
3658160	3659160	What are they getting?
3659160	3663640	Crossboard 7, Karada D- What's Crossboard 7?
3663640	3666920	Well now I gotta look, it's from Konami.
3666920	3668120	It is a Kinect game.
3668120	3669820	Oh, Adrenaline Misfits.
3669820	3670820	Is that what that is?
3670820	3671820	That's what it is over here.
3671820	3681200	Okay, then there's Karada de Kitaro Ashitari no Torre, which is, looks like a game that
3681200	3684640	uses like, it's like a brain training type of game but with Kinect.
3684640	3689440	Uh, Dr. Kiyosawa's brain and body training is what it's gonna be coming out over here.
3689440	3690920	Wow, look at you.
3690920	3696080	Sonic Sports, Sonic Free Riders, and that's all I'm seeing for their releases out the
3696080	3697080	gate.
3697080	3700240	So I don't know if it's just not as huge of a launch over there or what.
3700240	3703800	And that brain training game is, it's by the guy that did Brain Age.
3703800	3707000	Very interesting that there's no localized Dance Central, so the only dance game they're
3707000	3709160	gonna have is Dance Masters.
3709160	3710160	Interesting.
3710160	3717860	Uh, Playstation 3, Agreste Senke 2 comes out in regular and limited edition.
3717860	3719100	Why are you laughing over there?
3719100	3722880	It's Record of the Agreste Wars, remember the bringing game?
3722880	3724240	Oh, yes.
3724240	3726840	Oh my gosh.
3726840	3732440	You play an amnesiac murderer, you have killed a god, to revive him you must travel the land
3732440	3735880	with three heroines and choose one of them to soul pleat.
3735880	3738160	Yeah, soul pleat.
3738160	3743240	I know, I know what they mean by that.
3743240	3746000	Call of Duty Black Ops has a subtitle edition there as well.
3746000	3749960	A candy pink version of the DualShock 3, hooray.
3749960	3755680	Gekyatsu, Pachi Game Tamashi, Evangelion, Hajimari no Fukuin comes out this week.
3755680	3758000	More Evangelion, is it based on the new series?
3758000	3761000	I don't know.
3761000	3763920	It looks like a card game and it has clips from the anime in it.
3763920	3766720	Oh, is it a pachinko game or a card game?
3766720	3767720	I think it's pachinko.
3767720	3770420	Oh yeah, that looks like a pachinko game.
3770420	3772640	That part does, but I don't know, there might be more to it.
3772640	3774680	It might be a party game or something.
3774680	3776640	Move to Party comes out as well.
3776640	3781320	That's just what, the move, PlayStation move, party game, but it's cute.
3781320	3785360	Nikudan comes out this week as well from Sony in Japan.
3785360	3789400	I don't know what game this is, but it's like a fighting game that uses the move.
3789400	3790400	What is this?
3790400	3792260	That's the fight the lights out.
3792260	3793640	Is this out here already?
3793640	3795720	Yeah, it's terrible.
3795720	3797760	Looks very hardcore.
3797760	3801320	Sims 3 also comes out this week on PlayStation 3 in Japan as well.
3801320	3804400	This is a big week for releases in Japan.
3804400	3806800	Nintendo Wii gets Sonic Colors this week.
3806800	3811680	I'm sorry, that's a US release that a lot of people in Japan are bringing over.
3811680	3815280	Oh no, it is out as well on the 18th.
3815280	3817440	It's on there twice.
3817440	3823720	Tatyate Hasumu Smash Ball Plus with a pink Wii Remote Plus.
3823720	3824720	That comes out.
3824720	3828080	That's the game that was circulating earlier is coming with the, it's Fling Smash.
3828080	3830200	Yeah, that's what it is.
3830200	3834060	Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin, and this comes with a power-up kit.
3834060	3838040	That's a price reduction of a game that was already out.
3838040	3843160	And then World Soccer Winning 11 2011 comes out on the Wii this week as well.
3843160	3848000	Going to the handhelds real quick, on the Nintendo DS, there is the Pokemon Black and
3848000	3850200	White DSIs are coming out very soon.
3850200	3856920	Otherwise Sonic Colors is coming out as well as a game called Motostitich Rhythm de Rakugaki
3856920	3861840	Daisakusen comes out from Disney this week, so it must be some type of Disney rhythm game.
3861840	3864600	I'm trying to load more information on that right now.
3864600	3866200	Oh, it is Stitch.
3866200	3869240	Why did they put an extra T in his name?
3869240	3871840	They have that camo I wrote over here around March.
3871840	3873480	It was a Stitch music game.
3873480	3875400	So the Stitch music game is coming out in Japan this week.
3875400	3876800	I forgot what it was called though.
3876800	3878920	Yeah, it probably isn't that notable.
3878920	3883480	And then on the Sony PSP this week, a brand new PSP bundle in Black and Red and White
3883480	3889600	and Blue, those all come out this week, as well as Criminal Girls is the game that comes
3889600	3891440	out this week.
3891440	3892440	I'll leave that to your imagination.
3892440	3897920	It's an RPG and it has chicks in prisoner outfits with big boobies and cop outfits in
3897920	3905040	big boobies and yep, lots of big boobies in that chibi anime style for your PSP.
3905040	3908000	Criminal Girls, because they've been very bad and they need to be punished.
3908000	3910440	Just like Dark Sakura in the UK releases.
3910440	3913040	I don't need to be punished.
3913040	3915000	I'm a good girl.
3915000	3916720	Now I've got to find them again.
3916720	3917720	Okay.
3917720	3919720	On the 19th, the whole bunch of stuff.
3919720	3926720	We have Apache Air Assault, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Blood Drive, Create, EA Sports
3926720	3932880	Active 2.0, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, Harvest Moon Animal Parade, Harvest
3932880	3939000	Moon Sunshine, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, and Prince of Persia Trilogy and Split Second
3939000	3943600	Velocity, and the Piece of Crap Superhero Squad.
3943600	3945000	I love Marvel, but damn.
3945000	3948780	Oh, and on the 21st, Super Crate Box.
3948780	3949780	Super Crate Box?
3949780	3951200	I'm going to see what this is.
3951200	3952200	Or Crepe Box.
3952200	3953200	Crepe.
3953200	3954880	Because I was like, mm, crepe sounds really good right now.
3954880	3956760	I don't know about you guys, but crepe.
3956760	3958160	It doesn't have anything for it.
3958160	3959160	Oh, Crepe Box?
3959160	3960160	It's a Super Crepe Box.
3960160	3963640	Like, isn't that redundant?
3963640	3964640	Crepe Box?
3964640	3966120	Well, it's a box that you store crates in.
3966120	3967720	It makes sense.
3967720	3971400	That makes as much sense as Forklift.
3971400	3974680	They're talking about that Criminal Girls game in our chat room and Breakman is like,
3974680	3975680	Criminal Girls?
3975680	3980240	This is a girls' prison game, and Frisbee chimes in with, OK, girls, shower time.
3980240	3983240	You guys all need to get laid, seriously.
3983240	3984240	Alright.
3984240	3986920	Nothing wrong with that.
3986920	3990120	They're just trying to be cleanly.
3990120	3995600	So, uh, how about that Microsoft?
3995600	3996640	How about it?
3996640	3997640	How about them?
3997640	4000120	Um, they are suing Motorola.
4000120	4006560	No, not because some bad phone deal, but apparently they licensed some technology from Motorola
4006560	4009160	and Motorola decided, hey, you know what?
4009160	4010800	We want more money.
4010800	4016360	And they've been charging royalties that are excessive and discriminatory, according to
4016360	4018520	Microsoft.
4018520	4025960	And apparently, I guess this is regarding its video decoding and wireless LAN technology.
4025960	4030680	I guess that's incorporated into the Xbox 360.
4030680	4035680	And apparently they are going to court over it to see whether or not Microsoft has to
4035680	4043760	pay those excessive royalties that Motorola thinks are deserved.
4043760	4045520	Hmm.
4045520	4048600	Yay, lawsuits.
4048600	4049960	There's always some lawsuit.
4049960	4052560	Somebody suing somebody over something.
4052560	4054200	Oh, yeah.
4054200	4059920	Will this change gaming as we know it, or is this just kind of a cock-waving competition?
4059920	4062760	It just, I don't think it's going to change anything.
4062760	4064880	It's just about rights and stuff.
4064880	4066680	It just means that they make less money.
4066680	4072280	You know, maybe if you were investing in Microsoft or Motorola, that might matter to you, but
4072280	4073680	probably not.
4073680	4079320	And if Microsoft loses the case, they'll just pass the expense onto the consumers.
4079320	4082040	And then the sun will continue to rise tomorrow.
4082040	4083040	Exactly.
4083040	4084040	Nice.
4084040	4088920	By the way, just, I don't mean to backtrack, but sometimes the chat room is a little lagged,
4088920	4093640	but I'm getting some tells about the Stitch game that we were talking about before.
4093640	4094640	Apparently it's getting a...
4094640	4095640	Stitch Jam is what it was called.
4095640	4096640	Stitch Jam.
4096640	4098280	But the Japanese version of Stitch Jam.
4098280	4099560	Apparently they're liking it over there.
4099560	4101240	Famitsu's given it a silver rating.
4101240	4105240	So just because they're based off of movies does not necessarily mean they're...
4105240	4108240	Anything that Famitsu doesn't totally fart on has to be somewhat decent.
4108240	4109240	Well, yeah.
4109240	4112600	I mean, Famitsu's harsh, at least they used to be.
4112600	4116080	Well, if you want it now, I'm sure it's dirt cheap because it's been out since March and
4116080	4118320	it wasn't that hot of a seller.
4118320	4120920	In fact, it wasn't really much of a seller at all.
4120920	4123520	I wonder if it's gonna do better over there than it did here.
4123520	4124520	Interesting.
4124520	4126880	Stitch is super, super popular.
4126880	4127880	That makes sense, actually.
4127880	4133420	Like, you can get, like, total, um, the UFO catchers, like, are just totally Stitch loaded
4133420	4134420	in some places.
4134420	4135420	Hmm.
4135420	4136420	So...
4136420	4137420	Stitch is adorable, though.
4137420	4138420	Stitch is great.
4138420	4139420	Alright.
4139420	4145400	I saw a Stitch costume online in one of those costume contest things online.
4145400	4147960	I don't want to get into all the details, but it was a cute costume.
4147960	4148960	Good times.
4148960	4149960	That's cute.
4149960	4150960	Mm-hmm.
4150960	4151960	Hey!
4151960	4154480	Let's talk about Instant Action.
4154480	4155560	They've now ceased to be.
4155560	4156560	That's too bad.
4156560	4157560	Instant...
4157560	4159040	I remember seeing these guys at PAX one year.
4159040	4161680	I think they were at PAX East earlier this year.
4161680	4162680	I don't know.
4162680	4163680	But, yeah.
4163680	4166720	These guys were famous because they were developing this technology where you could play Monkey
4166720	4172760	Island in your browser window, and Instant Jam, I think, had a whole thing going on.
4172760	4174400	Well, here's the deal.
4174400	4178600	Instant Action actually informed their employees that they're going to wind down operations.
4178600	4181600	They are shutting down instantaction.com.
4181600	4188040	They are, however, going to continue torquepower.com while they look for buyers for torque.
4188040	4190040	So there you go.
4190040	4191960	Ah, yep.
4191960	4197080	I guess there's also a comment that was made to the Kotaku website in that, quote, it was
4197080	4202040	an operating in a highly competitive industry, and the business didn't scale profitably in
4202040	4203840	the manner we had expected.
4203840	4207680	Well, unfortunately, you know, some of these things just take kind of time to build, and
4207680	4212480	it doesn't sound like they had a huge catalog of the streaming games, and, you know, I think
4212480	4216680	in order to make a splash, you've got to kind of have that must-have game that's available
4216680	4220800	through your technology, and unfortunately, Monkey Island, as good of a game as it was,
4220800	4223960	just wasn't it, because it had already been out for a little while, and I think most people
4223960	4228520	that wanted to play it probably already did, so bummer.
4228520	4231480	Hopefully those guys, though, are able to land on their feet again in new positions
4231480	4234880	somewhere very soon, or maybe that whole torque-powered thing will work out.
4234880	4235880	Who knows?
4235880	4240800	Anyhow, it's now time for the part of our show where we will take a trip down memory
4240800	4248800	lane, and ask Dark Soccer to climb into the vault, but not too quickly, because we don't
4248800	4250720	want to get trapped in there.
4250720	4256360	And pick a classic game that she says, hey, listen kids, you should be playing this game
4256360	4257360	right now.
4257360	4259520	Get up off your couch and shake your butt.
4259520	4263720	And I gotta say, I know what the classic game of the week this week is, and it kind of pains
4263720	4268080	me to think that, yeah, this game is like nine years old, and now qualifies as a classic
4268080	4269080	game.
4269080	4277120	Rob's text to me was, I have to read this, because this is funny, hold on, where is it?
4277120	4282800	I just lolled when I said I'd put it out.
4282800	4285560	Well tell us what it is already, I can't stand the suspense.
4285560	4287620	Para Para Paradise!
4287620	4298600	And I picked the long version of my favorite song from that one.
4298600	4305600	Tell me you don't want to shake your butt to this.
4305600	4312280	This is my favorite song.
4312280	4315280	Those chicks can't count.
4315280	4317480	They use different numbers in Japan.
4317480	4325920	Okay, Para Para Paradise, which was made by Konami, and it is a Gamani game, and it's
4325920	4329080	for Para Para Dancing!
4329080	4336360	It uses a motion sensor controller that's in an octagonal platform shape, and has five
4336360	4340840	directional sensors that lets you, where it is, you've got Para Para mode where you do
4340840	4346240	all the set, actual routines for the songs, and freestyle mode where you can dance around
4346240	4353240	however you want to as long as you hit them, or like Iguana Girl does, goth dance.
4353240	4357120	I've seen all sorts of creative interpretations to the dancing in this game, it's pretty awesome.
4357120	4360160	I've seen people just use their pelvis, actually, to activate the arrows.
4360160	4361160	Yes, it is.
4361160	4362960	I've seen people do it with just their legs.
4362960	4366360	Pretending they have a, you know, pretending they have their penis out, or in some cases
4366360	4368360	in the privacy of their own home, not pretending.
4368360	4370640	If you've got the pink biscuits, then you do.
4370640	4373560	Well there were different versions, there was of course the first mix, and then there
4373560	4380600	was a second mix that had the actual models dancing along with you mirrored so that you
4380600	4388640	could see them, and it even had a learn the Para mode, learn the dance mode, which, that's
4388640	4390640	how I learned a few of them was playing that.
4390640	4393080	I think Stockton Golf Land still has theirs.
4393080	4395600	I need to get back there.
4395600	4397480	Yeah, it was super fun.
4397480	4404040	It had, for the US, oh not the US, I'm just saying we never got it over here, for the
4404040	4412080	home version, it had actual dancers that you could play in mirrored mode, or it had it
4412080	4414520	in the corner, you could watch Learn It Too.
4414520	4416400	Which is what Dance Masters is now.
4416400	4425080	Yeah, well Dance Masters is, it defaults mirrored, so that's pretty cool.
4425080	4431520	It basically, it was really neat, I thought, because it was something, now, I'll tell you
4431520	4439160	what, I had actually just heard about Para Para dancing right about the same time the
4439160	4443840	game came out, and then I saw pictures of people playing, I was like, they're doing
4443840	4445680	those little dances!
4445680	4449040	The first time we ever met was over at Para Para Para Ice Machine, wasn't it?
4449040	4455500	And that was, I learned like half of Eurobeat, that particular song.
4455500	4460400	Your song's over, so I'm gonna play one of mine, it's in Dance Masters actually.
4460400	4461400	Like a Virgin?
4461400	4462400	I don't know.
4462400	4463400	Where, oh.
4463400	4467680	These are all people playing the stupid game, no I do love that song though, let me see
4467680	4468680	if I can find that.
4468680	4469680	It's by Virginelle, I think.
4469680	4471680	God, how do I know this?
4471680	4475540	Well, and also one of our listeners has been kind of hooking me up with lots and lots and
4475540	4480240	lots of super Eurobeat CDs and dance manias and stuff.
4480240	4483920	I've been quite the pleased little fangirl.
4483920	4491600	But yeah, and the other thing with the whole Para Para genre is that it really came up
4491600	4496600	with the whole Gyaru sub, oh you found it?
4496600	4497600	Was I right?
4497600	4498600	Huh.
4498600	4504760	Sorry, I just wanted the bones in there.
4504760	4509480	It was really attached very strongly to the Gyaru subculture too, which is actually still
4509480	4516760	going on, 10 plus years strong, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they all Para Para and
4516760	4517760	go to clubs.
4517760	4525800	Velfar, the song that, the first song, got Rob sitting in his chair doing the damn dance.
4525800	4531240	But the club- I can't believe I remember this, I feel so gay right now.
4531240	4537560	But the big Para Para club, Velfar, that that song was made for, they, since it's gone out
4537560	4540760	of business I think it's gone down, or it's turned into a different place.
4540760	4545400	But yeah, I mean there were all kinds of Avex tracks, songs like Velfar 2000, Anniversary,
4545400	4552320	Boom Boom Fire, some of the J-Euro tracks, which my favorite was Deluxe because that
4552320	4555800	was the one where you shook your butt, really, a lot.
4555800	4559520	Rob's back to doing the dance again.
4559520	4563520	There was a Korean version that came out.
4563520	4568840	Now Para Para Paradise only came out at the Jabbalies Market, but there were the three
4568840	4573960	arcade versions because there was a 1.5 and then the second J-Mix.
4573960	4578640	But there was a Korean version called Para Para Dancing that was pretty much mostly Korean
4578640	4587240	music, like it had BoA and SES and it had a version of Hold On Me done in Korean.
4587240	4595360	And it said that you could, I guess, play front to back and it had some in the back
4595360	4601800	so you could face, instead of facing the machine, you could face the crowd so you could dance
4601800	4607640	to them.
4607640	4612680	And by the way, Rob was looking at the video that I have been watching to relearn the dances.
4612680	4617120	This is not a play through, it's a little piggy crying wee wee wee.
4617120	4618120	Stupid advertisements.
4618120	4620120	I'll talk over it.
4620120	4621120	Alright.
4621120	4623520	Then there was an open source one.
4623520	4629440	The StepMania had support for Para Para Paradise and then there's one called Parastar that's
4629440	4636680	a StepMania 4.0 modification you can get at Club Parastar if you just look up their website.
4636680	4642240	Then they're actually, the main developers are trying to crack it.
4642240	4643760	They've gotten pretty far with it.
4643760	4647280	They've gotten through the test menu but they can't operate it since they can't find the
4647280	4649280	input ports.
4649280	4650280	And there you have it, Rob.
4650280	4651880	You wanna turn this one up?
4651880	4653720	I can't, it's not playing.
4653720	4654720	There we go.
4654720	4657240	Here we go.
4657240	4658240	This is in Dance Masters.
4658240	4659240	Did you mention the Dreamcast one?
4659240	4660240	Yes, it was the Dreamcast one too.
4660240	4665680	I believe it's not mentioned here, but yeah, you had the Dreamcast one, didn't you?
4665680	4666680	Is Dream Para, yeah.
4666680	4667680	Dream Para.
4667680	4670400	They had the, what, blue biscuits or purple?
4670400	4671400	They're purple.
4671400	4672400	Yeah.
4672400	4673400	Or no, green.
4673400	4674400	Green biscuits.
4674400	4675400	Green biscuits.
4675400	4676400	That was it.
4676400	4681400	Because I think that green is the opposite of the Para pink.
4681400	4682400	That hot green.
4682400	4690400	I got it because I can get a controller adapter to hook them up to my PC so I could use it
4690400	4691400	for, you know.
4691400	4696400	I actually was just wrong because it wouldn't be a neon green, it would be a dark green.
4696400	4698400	It would be the opposite of hot pink.
4698400	4700400	Anyway, that's a different story.
4700400	4702640	That's me going into color theory, sorry.
4702640	4705120	I'm just staring at this girl, she's so adorable.
4705120	4709160	You should watch her one for Velfar because she's absolutely even more adorable.
4709160	4712240	She does the little happy pose.
4712240	4716320	So how is it detecting what she's doing, is it like a semicircle on the floor that she's
4716320	4717320	standing in?
4717320	4718640	Well, she's actually just doing the dance.
4718640	4719640	Okay.
4719640	4722480	But in the game, it has five sensors.
4722480	4726480	There's one to each side, one diagonally on each side, and then one in front of you.
4726480	4732200	So when you do your hand waving, it'll fit.
4732200	4737760	And it doesn't necessarily register your height of where your hands are, it just measures
4737760	4739720	that they're in the right position.
4739720	4740720	So.
4740720	4741920	Good times.
4741920	4742920	Yep.
4742920	4745200	So it's Para-para-paradise.
4745200	4749080	Your classic game of the week, Para-para-paradise.
4749080	4751000	Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4751000	4755760	Old favorite from back in the Bimani fandom days, although I'm still a fan of Bimani,
4755760	4756760	you know, back when it was good.
4756760	4761140	All right, anyhow, that's gonna do it for part A, but hey, we have plenty more show
4761140	4762140	to come.
4762140	4763140	Don't go anywhere.
4763140	4764640	When we come back, we're gonna talk plenty more.
4764640	4766360	We have a lot of quick, quick news tonight.
4766360	4771000	Things about like Yars' Revenge, more Facebook games, Lame Castle, Naughty Bear 2, believe
4771000	4772000	it or not.
4772000	4773960	We're gonna talk about Black Ops a little bit.
4773960	4777800	I know it's not usually the type of game we get into on the show, but it's broken sales
4777800	4778800	records.
4778800	4782520	We have to say something about it and talk a little bit about maybe a change in how to
4782520	4783520	price games.
4783520	4784800	That would be nice, wouldn't it?
4784800	4788840	So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
4788840	4795920	We'll be back right after this.
4795920	4798560	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4798560	4806280	We are live on November the 14th of 2010 here for the 389th episode of our show.
4806280	4809760	Join us in our chat room if you are listening live because we do tape live every week Sunday
4809760	4811860	night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
4811860	4817480	You can join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where some of the chatters were reacting
4817480	4819360	to the music that we were playing during the break.
4819360	4820360	Some loved it.
4820360	4821360	Some hated it.
4821360	4824160	Sadly, we can't do the music during the podcast because it is copyrighted stuff.
4824160	4827840	We were playing some of the music from the Classic Game of the Week, Pa-da-pa-da-pa-da-dice,
4827840	4832120	and it's all happy, bouncy stuff, and it's, you know, very interesting.
4832120	4834160	I'll certainly say that.
4834160	4838520	So anyhow, we're gonna get back into some gaming news here real quick.
4838520	4841000	I guess we'll start off with Loki.
4841000	4844140	Yes, some rapid fire news here.
4844140	4849720	We've got news that, and I don't know if this is too exciting, I liked at least one of these
4849720	4850720	games.
4850720	4856480	Wet 2 and Naughty Bear 2 are confirmed in development at Behaviour.
4856480	4862280	Wet was kind of cool, it was sort of supposed to be like a punk-rockish action game, and
4862280	4863880	I thought it was alright.
4863880	4866840	Naughty Bear 2, eh, wasn't all that great.
4866840	4869560	Naughty Bear 2 was one of those things that, like, looked great on paper.
4869560	4873760	Yeah, Naughty Bear, it was just kinda, eh, didn't do very well.
4873760	4879440	Well it also just got raped by the critics, and, you know, and it's not for lack of reason,
4879440	4881680	you know, it was kinda crap.
4881680	4886440	Yeah, I'd actually like to go back and play Wet, because I think that'd be pretty cool.
4886440	4892680	Naughty Bear 2, really don't need to work on that, it's, eh, whatever.
4892680	4896640	This is kinda neat, I guess, if you're into the whole social gaming stuff.
4896640	4901920	Connect Sports has an app now on Facebook, and it'll allow you to actually track your
4901920	4908960	player's league results, and allow them to issue invitations to have others be invited,
4908960	4913120	and also, I guess, video highlights from the game.
4913120	4919400	I haven't played the game yet, so I guess it takes video of you, and, of course, videos
4919400	4924280	won't be shown unless you go ahead and give it the okay to do so.
4924280	4930880	But yeah, that is available now on Facebook, so if you wanna check it out, go to apps.facebook.com
4930880	4931880	slash Connect Sports.
4931880	4932880	Do you own Connect Sports?
4932880	4933880	I do.
4933880	4934880	What do you think?
4934880	4935880	Haven't played it.
4935880	4937880	Like, I just said, haven't played it yet.
4937880	4938880	I'm sorry.
4938880	4939880	I was trying to-
4939880	4941600	I don't have a lot of time, and, you know, honestly, when it's like, well, I could try
4941600	4946080	Connect Sports, or I could play Dance Central.
4946080	4950720	I saw, like, five seconds of it in a store, an electronics store, where they had it on
4950720	4954280	demo and the bowling game was up, and it looked cute.
4954280	4959960	You know, that reminds me, since I went to Burger King before I came over here, which,
4959960	4966920	by the way, I had three of the buck doubles, I stacked them onto a six-pattie burger and
4966920	4972600	proceeded to eat that, which is slightly better for me than eating the three burgers because
4972600	4974960	I didn't eat all the buns to go along with it.
4974960	4975960	I saved-
4975960	4976960	Slightly better.
4976960	4977960	That's the set.
4977960	4981200	That's eating three-quarters of the carton of ice cream instead of the whole carton.
4981200	4982200	It was good for you.
4982200	4983200	All right.
4983200	4986700	But anyways, I just thought I'd mention for the Sacramento area listeners, actually, it's
4986700	4991760	funny enough, this week, the Connect Tour that Microsoft is doing is actually coming
4991760	4999160	to the Burger King that I went to to get my food, which would be on 7760 Sunrise Boulevard
4999160	5000160	Citrus Heights.
5000160	5004880	They're going to be there November 17th and 18th from 1030 to 730 p.m.
5004880	5009920	So if you want to go check out some of the stuff and maybe get some swag, yeah, it's
5009920	5016120	like literally up the street from here, so, you know, you can go ahead and do that there.
5016120	5020060	So I just thought I'd mention that or Xbox.com such Burger King if you want to know those
5020060	5021560	dates later on.
5021560	5023560	But yeah, that's later this week.
5023560	5024960	It's kind of cool.
5024960	5025960	Yeah.
5025960	5029740	So if you're interested, like I said, if you're into social gaming, honestly, I would never
5029740	5033360	use this because I hate when people do that kind of stuff.
5033360	5038360	And maybe I'm just not the right person for that kind of thing.
5038360	5040280	Finally, this is kind of cool.
5040280	5047760	Apparently there is the PSP commercial where they were dissing, I guess, gaming on phones
5047760	5052600	and whatnot, and they had a game called Lame Castle that was in this PSP commercial.
5052600	5058160	Well, funny enough, someone apparently decided, hey, you know what, we're going to make Lame
5058160	5059240	Castle.
5059240	5068040	So apparently it is actually in development by a team called B-Rad Entertainment and they
5068040	5074880	have released Lame Castle on Android and there's an iPhone version also apparently in the works.
5074880	5076840	So that's kind of funny.
5076840	5077840	Lame Castle.
5077840	5078840	Lame Castle.
5078840	5079840	Well, they're getting free advertising.
5079840	5080840	I mean, why not?
5080840	5081840	Yeah.
5081840	5082840	All right.
5082840	5085720	Some other news going on in the gaming world real quick here.
5085720	5090520	A little bit of a WoW story, but this is big enough to report on here.
5090520	5093520	There's now a dial-in battle.net authenticator.
5093520	5098920	You know how WoW accounts are very prone to getting hacked sometimes by shady people?
5098920	5102200	Well, authenticators have been something that Blizzard's really been pushing and if you
5102200	5106560	have an iPhone or a Droid or really any mobile phone capable of running apps, you can get
5106560	5107560	a free authenticator.
5107560	5110600	I wasn't even serious about the game and I had an authenticator.
5110600	5111600	Yeah.
5111600	5115040	I mean, and anybody that's going to play the game that really values their stuff really
5115040	5116260	ought to get one.
5116260	5119320	It's sad that it's come to this, but it's really not Blizzard's fault.
5119320	5122340	I mean, people are trying to hack this game left and right.
5122340	5128000	So one thing that Blizzard is putting out there is that they now have a dial-in authenticator.
5128000	5130400	It's basically a phone number that you can call.
5130400	5135880	It's an 800 number and any time that the game detects suspicious activity, the game will
5135880	5138480	call you and give you a password to put in.
5138480	5140560	You basically like give it a phone number.
5140560	5141560	You call this number.
5141560	5145120	I haven't used it myself, but it's kind of interesting.
5145120	5148800	It's a standby telephone-based way of verifying you.
5148800	5152720	Again, you only have to use it when it detects suspicious activity.
5152720	5157800	Then I guess, you know, basically that the logins are coming from a foreign country.
5157800	5163080	So kind of interesting that they've put that as a solution as well.
5163080	5165480	You know, Atari's been updating some of their old classics lately.
5165480	5168080	Haunted House was just released on the Xbox as a fourth.
5168080	5169080	Never played it.
5169080	5170080	And did anyone care?
5170080	5171080	I don't know.
5171080	5174320	More people might care about this one though, because this was one of the best Atari 2600
5174320	5175320	games that was out there.
5175320	5178200	Yars Revenge apparently is coming out.
5178200	5181880	It's supposed to be quarter one of 2011 coming out on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live
5181880	5184440	Arcade, and of course the PC.
5184440	5188920	That is from a financial results briefing that Atari had earlier this week.
5188920	5190840	Yars Revenge is on its way.
5190840	5194600	Also, by the way, Asteroids, Star Raiders, and Centipede are all supposed to be getting
5194600	5195920	remakes within the next year.
5195920	5197680	Those are already previously announced.
5197680	5199480	Didn't they do that stuff?
5199480	5205200	I know they've done Asteroid remakes and they haven't been that good.
5205200	5206960	Some of the remakes are really hit and miss.
5206960	5212880	I think back though, remember when they redid Pong on the PlayStation 1?
5212880	5214480	That was actually kind of a cool game.
5214480	5215720	At least back in the PS1 game.
5215720	5218400	And I guess Tempest 2000 or whatever was supposed to be.
5218400	5220280	As far as recent remakes though, I don't know.
5220280	5222840	I didn't play the Haunted House one, but I have zero interest in it.
5222840	5225520	But if the Yars Revenge one's any good, I'll check it out.
5225520	5226520	Why not?
5226520	5230280	Anyhow, one other news story for you guys.
5230280	5235760	This is about a game that has come out of RPG Maker 2003.
5235760	5237560	It's called Marvel Brothel.
5237560	5242600	Yes, it is a sex RPG.
5242600	5247480	It's basically a 16-bit style game because it was done in RPG Maker.
5247480	5251160	And yeah, if you're a fan of Marvel, I don't know how you're going to feel about this.
5251160	5258160	But hey, at least there's appearances from Mojo, and Forge, and Kingpin, and yeah.
5258160	5262920	The best comment about that is one that was made by Toad from a particular screen capture
5262920	5264480	that I saw.
5264480	5265880	Magneto says to stop it.
5265880	5268400	This is a retarded and stupid idea.
5268400	5274760	Do you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad?
5274760	5279320	Same thing that happens when you let Joss Whedon write a screenplay.
5279320	5282200	Hey.
5282200	5285480	You can address those emails to Salacious Pop.
5285480	5286800	Actually he doesn't have an email in the Orange Lounge.
5286800	5289520	Maybe we need to get him one for all the hate mail he's going to generate there.
5289520	5290520	Alright.
5290520	5293720	Anyhow, let's move on, Dark Sakura.
5293720	5300280	Well, in other news, for those of us who are mobile phone gamers, Splatterhouse is coming
5300280	5301280	out.
5301280	5304240	Splatterhouse is cool.
5304240	5310040	Namco is going to be doing a release of Splatterhouse on November 23rd.
5310040	5313180	And yeah, Splatterhouse.
5313180	5320000	We also have Angry Birds, which is a game that I just heard of and downloaded yesterday.
5320000	5323280	Because my husband's aunt is addicted to it.
5323280	5327040	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and WiiWare.
5327040	5328880	And there's going to be a sequel.
5328880	5335560	And basically this game, you slingshot different varieties of birds into castles and buildings
5335560	5336560	and other things.
5336560	5338320	And different birds have different powers.
5338320	5342240	You have bomb birds and you have birds that drop eggs.
5342240	5343820	Or maybe poop.
5343820	5349680	It's really the most popular iPhone game right now and I'm not as into it, but I don't hate
5349680	5350680	it.
5350680	5351680	I mean, whatever.
5351680	5352680	If that's what people want to play.
5352680	5354040	It's better than fart apps.
5354040	5359000	Someone on the Bart train that I rode up here was playing Three Angry Birds right next to
5359000	5360000	me.
5360000	5361760	And I just wanted to smack it out of his hand.
5361760	5362760	Why is that?
5362760	5363760	Why all the hate?
5363760	5369560	I played it on the iPad when you got your iPhone 4 and I got to like the third level
5369560	5371020	and I don't get it.
5371020	5372020	It's kind of stupid.
5372020	5373020	I didn't like it.
5373020	5375080	Well now you can play it on Xbox Live Arcade or not.
5375080	5376080	Or you can make fun of it there.
5376080	5377080	Yes.
5377080	5378080	There you go.
5378080	5380120	But you won't be using your fingers to do it.
5380120	5381120	No.
5381120	5382120	No.
5382120	5383120	No.
5383120	5384840	Anything else, DarkSakura, before we get to Twitter topics?
5384840	5385840	Yes.
5385840	5387240	Rock band releases.
5387240	5388240	Ooh.
5388240	5389240	Um.
5389240	5393160	The, the, the, the Bee Gees.
5393160	5394160	The Bee Gees are awesome.
5394160	5395160	Yeah.
5395160	5397160	Look at that hair.
5397160	5403640	Actually, that particular image is the same image that was used on the back cover of the
5403640	5405000	Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.
5405000	5407040	And you know how I know this.
5407040	5409280	I had two versions of it on vinyl.
5409280	5410920	A double LP.
5410920	5412760	The guy in the middle looks kind of like Jesus.
5412760	5413760	Like, you can't deny that.
5413760	5414760	I'm going to post this in the chatroom.
5414760	5415760	He's Disco Jesus.
5415760	5416760	Yeah, he's Disco Jesus.
5416760	5417760	Uh.
5417760	5424000	But you know, I actually do like the Bee Gees.
5424000	5432560	But anyway, there's going to be A Wider Shade of Pale by Procol Harum and The Thrill is
5432560	5433560	Gone by B.B.
5433560	5434560	King.
5434560	5435560	That's always cool.
5435560	5439960	The Bee Gees pack is going to have Jive Talkin, Night Fever, Stand Alive, Nights on Broadway,
5439960	5442080	Tragedy, and You Should Be Dancing.
5442080	5446680	The first three and the last one were all on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.
5446680	5450640	You Should Be Dancing, yeah.
5450640	5460200	Tragedy is the name of a heavy metal Bee Gees cover band because I've played some of them
5460200	5462920	on the show before.
5462920	5465040	Wow.
5465040	5473640	And there's also a couple of them, which is Stand Alive and The Thrill is Gone have pro
5473640	5477280	guitar bass expansions for 80 Microsoft points.
5477280	5481280	You gotta have the Stand Alive with the pro expansions.
5481280	5482280	Awesome.
5482280	5487520	And I remember this picture very vividly because, like I said, I grew up with both copies of
5487520	5490500	this album and played them until they skipped.
5490500	5492000	You know I've never seen Saturday Night Fever?
5492000	5493000	Isn't that weird?
5493000	5494000	Am I weird?
5494000	5497480	This is the beginning of it really, just watching John Travolta all young and strutting down
5497480	5498640	the street with those shoes.
5498640	5503160	I hear it's actually kind of a shit movie, but yet it was insanely popular.
5503160	5508420	The sequel is something else, Directed by Sylvester Stallone.
5508420	5512120	It actually has some showgirls aspects to it because there are these big musical numbers
5512120	5515160	where everyone's half naked and it's like, what am I watching?
5515160	5516160	What is this?
5516160	5521360	Headbands and short shorts, which leads up to Xanadu, which is headbands and leg warmers
5521360	5524680	and roller skates.
5524680	5526440	Shall we move on to Twitter topics?
5526440	5532240	I think we shall fire up the tweeter and look at some tweeter topics as we get into, oh,
5532240	5533480	where's my Twitter topic music?
5533480	5534480	It disappeared.
5534480	5535480	Tweet, tweet, tweet.
5535480	5536480	Who ate it?
5536480	5537480	Tweet, tweet, tweet.
5537480	5540160	I deleted it when you were in the can.
5540160	5541160	Clearly.
5541160	5542160	Somebody deleted it.
5542160	5547400	Who's hatin' on Santa Morete?
5547400	5551520	I guess Star Sackers is going to have to see it.
5551520	5553240	Didn't this happen last week with Twitter music?
5553240	5554240	Oh, there it is.
5554240	5555240	There it is.
5555240	5556240	We're saved.
5556240	5560760	Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.
5560760	5567080	Going on to our Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. Let's get into a tweet here from Potculture
5567080	5568480	is going to start us off tonight.
5568480	5573720	Don't know if you guys discussed it before, but I just found an Android and iOS mobile
5573720	5576360	MMO game called Pocket Legends.
5576360	5579480	The game is free, does have microtransactions.
5579480	5581400	Pretty fun and well worth checking out.
5581400	5583840	Cross platform 2, supposedly.
5583840	5586360	Actually I have played this game because I also noticed it was free.
5586360	5588720	It doesn't support Game Center or any of that stuff, but who cares?
5588720	5591360	Game Center was kind of a flop, as was Ping.
5591360	5597320	But anyhow, for a free game, it's very robust because it runs on like 3D graphics and it
5597320	5599800	is MMO-y.
5599800	5602480	Definitely a lot of Warcraft inspired things.
5602480	5606520	Not something I'd play long term, but for a free diversion when you're sitting on the
5606520	5607520	toilet.
5607520	5608520	Good times.
5608520	5611200	You totally reminded me of the shirt I want to get.
5611200	5612200	What's that?
5612200	5614040	It says iPhone changed the way I use the bathroom.
5614040	5616040	There you go.
5616040	5618200	Moving on to actdeft sends us a tweet.
5618200	5624080	Sly 4 is being teased in the Sly collection for the PS3.
5624080	5630080	I guess there's actually a little teaser trailer thingy on the PS3 that is teasing a new Sly
5630080	5631360	game.
5631360	5634480	But I mean, if there were three others and they've all been doing well, then it's a
5634480	5635480	state of collection.
5635480	5638520	Is this really a surprise to anybody?
5638520	5642120	But it's nice to have it somewhat officially confirmed.
5642120	5644000	Redertainment says it's a tweet.
5644000	5645000	Boxy.
5645000	5649360	Overpriced, oddly shaped box or over-fucking-priced, oddly shaped piece of shit.
5649360	5650360	I've never heard...
5650360	5651360	What is...
5651360	5652360	Boxy?
5652360	5653360	What is that?
5653360	5655440	Does anyone know what that is?
5655440	5658000	I think it's a streaming device.
5658000	5659960	Now I gotta Google it.
5659960	5661720	Boxy.
5661720	5665280	Watch movies, TV shows, and clips from the internet on your TV.
5665280	5667240	Can't you already do that with a PS3?
5667240	5668240	Pretty much.
5668240	5669240	Yep.
5669240	5670240	That's...
5670240	5671240	You're right.
5671240	5672240	It's...
5672240	5673360	You can watch things that are already on the internet.
5673360	5674360	It's a whole...
5674360	5676560	It's basically an answer to an Apple TV, it looks like.
5676560	5677560	How much do they want for it?
5677560	5678560	Let me see.
5678560	5679960	Buy a Boxy.
5679960	5682080	It's $199.
5682080	5683080	But it has...
5683080	5684080	Braces an Apple TV.
5684080	5685080	But...
5685080	5687200	Isn't an Apple TV only $99 now?
5687200	5688200	Really?
5688200	5691040	Actually, Boxy puts a little comparison right there.
5691040	5694280	They're saying there's more than there is to iTunes.
5694280	5699660	There's twice the HD, and Boxy plays more file formats.
5699660	5704160	Don't the new TiVos have a lot of internet integration in it now?
5704160	5705160	I think so.
5705160	5707160	Like if you want Hulu Plus, you can get it on TiVo, I think.
5707160	5708560	I have a way around that.
5708560	5711120	I have a computer hooked up to my television.
5711120	5715180	I would say, honestly, before you spend the money on this, I mean, I guess if you really
5715180	5717440	want something like this, yay.
5717440	5721320	But if you already have a Playstation or Xbox 360, look into the streaming alternatives
5721320	5722440	you have on there.
5722440	5726960	Or spend like $300 on a cheap-ass laptop.
5726960	5727960	And use that.
5727960	5730880	And then you can actually take the cheap-ass laptop with you.
5730880	5733520	Or you can build yourself a micro for like, what, $200?
5733520	5736920	I guess it depends on your budget, sir.
5736920	5740600	Our computer that we have in the front room was Leftovers.
5740600	5746200	And now it's our internet computer for the front room so that Dan can watch Top Gear.
5746200	5754600	You can get a PC that can stream stuff off the internet or play stuff for under $100.
5754600	5757480	Our buddy SSJ100Matt is sending us a pair of tweets here.
5757480	5758680	I'll read these real quickly.
5758680	5761240	One of them has to do with Galgun.
5761240	5765840	I guess Galgun is having a fight with Microsoft over panties.
5765840	5770640	Because apparently the official Galgun site is down.
5770640	5774600	I guess Galgun was supposed to be out on January 27th.
5774600	5777280	But they're having some problems with Microsoft.
5777280	5781080	There's negotiations over the moral issues about the game.
5781080	5785360	Microsoft is objecting to the content in the shooter.
5785360	5787360	Okay.
5787360	5789880	I don't think this is a game that's ever going to come out over here anyway, just because
5789880	5790880	of what it is.
5790880	5791880	So enjoy.
5791880	5797600	Also, SSJ100Matt sends us another tweet saying, hey, I know hockey doesn't bring the girls
5797600	5802240	to the yard, but Sony released NHL Game Center Live this week for the PS3.
5802240	5806160	And this is this whole thing where, and I was reading about this, I gotta say, yeah,
5806160	5809440	I don't watch every hockey game that's out there, but this sounds like the way to watch
5809440	5810440	a game.
5810440	5813560	This is pretty impressive from what I'm reading anyway.
5813560	5817560	I haven't watched it and compared it to the ESPN app.
5817560	5819640	You have to buy the subscription.
5819640	5823480	Okay, but if you're like an Uber hockey fan, you have to buy sports channels sometimes
5823480	5824480	too.
5824480	5825480	I mean, this sounds kind of interesting.
5825480	5827920	It's an app that's going to be in the video section of the Cross Media Bar.
5827920	5833240	It's going to be $10 unless you're a PlayStation Plus member, then it's free.
5833240	5837920	But apparently it's very similar to MLB TV, which also came out earlier on the PS3 this
5837920	5838920	year.
5838920	5844280	And if you subscribe to Game Center Live, which is $169 annually, you get all of these
5844280	5845280	features.
5845280	5850000	You stream live out of market games, select playoff broadcasts.
5850000	5853060	But what's cool is that it looks like the scoreboard kind of comes up live on your TV
5853060	5856800	and you can kind of use the controllers to switch events and stuff.
5856800	5859000	Kind of looks like a neat way to watch live sporting events.
5859000	5861120	I like this whole like interactive stuff.
5861120	5862920	Kind of cool.
5862920	5866040	So yeah, maybe I don't watch every sports game that's out there, but I think this kind
5866040	5868160	of technology is neat.
5868160	5873160	It's going to change the way we watch television forever.
5873160	5874400	The SEG is sending us a tweet.
5874400	5878120	You might remember he was here a few weeks ago and he was talking about UMLoud and he
5878120	5882400	wanted us to mention that now they've got a Pac-Man eBay auction that's going on at
5882400	5883400	UMLoud.
5883400	5885480	Y'all a fan of Pac-Man?
5885480	5886480	Well here's the deal.
5886480	5888520	They're actually going to be auctioning off at UMLoud.
5888520	5890080	Actually no, I'm sorry.
5890080	5891960	It's going to be on eBay right now.
5891960	5897500	I don't think they're, I don't know if they're actually going to do this at the event.
5897500	5900920	I guess since it's going on right now, you can get this right now.
5900920	5904520	I think they know this thing's worth a lot of money and they want to do it right now.
5904520	5908160	So yeah, it's Pac-Man for the Famicom.
5908160	5913280	So this is an old ass version of Pac-Man signed by Toro Iwatani.
5913280	5914680	Cool.
5914680	5916520	So, very cool.
5916520	5918560	Currently going for how much?
5918560	5922640	Right now it's up to $565, but it's autographed by the creator of Pac-Man.
5922640	5924460	That's pretty awesome.
5924460	5926640	More information available at UMLoud.org.
5926640	5928480	That's just in a couple of weeks.
5928480	5929800	I can't believe it's like right around the corner.
5929800	5931520	Can you believe it?
5931520	5933040	Crazy stuff.
5933040	5934040	Let's see.
5934040	5940920	Also on the tweets, going to Dark Tetsuya.
5940920	5943640	As if Naked Dance Central weren't enough, someone did this.
5943640	5945960	I'm always most afraid to click this link here, good God.
5945960	5948440	It's probably the IGN Naked story.
5948440	5951000	No, it's the Nuts.
5951000	5954720	Not safe for work, two naked girls playing Kinect.
5954720	5955720	It's topless.
5955720	5956720	Enter your date of birth.
5956720	5957720	Oh, then I want to see this.
5957720	5958720	Let's see.
5958720	5965720	June 26, 1932.
5965720	5966720	Sponsor message?
5966720	5968920	What's this bullshit?
5968920	5972120	Shut up.
5972120	5973120	This thing sucks.
5973120	5974760	Ah, don't buy this product.
5974760	5979320	How dare you link us to a video that has all these stupid sponsor messages in front.
5979320	5980320	Okay.
5980320	5981320	Here we go.
5981320	5985040	Oh, yes, I see movies.
5985040	5989320	Is it sad that I recognize which song they were playing and which difficulty in Dance
5989320	5990320	Central?
5990320	5992320	You can tell who's fake and who's not.
5992320	5994320	Actually, I think they're both fake.
5994320	5995320	They're both fake.
5995320	5996320	This makes for great radio.
5996320	5999920	We're looking at two topless chicks in studio right now.
5999920	6003320	They're playing Lady Gaga on Easy.
6003320	6005320	Oh, God, they are, aren't they?
6005320	6006320	Yeah.
6006320	6007320	Poker face.
6007320	6008320	That is sad that you recognize that.
6008320	6009320	It is very sad.
6009320	6011320	I think she has nice boobies.
6011320	6012320	But they're fake.
6012320	6013320	They don't move right.
6013320	6014320	And now they're doing the freestyle portion.
6014320	6015320	What do you think, Alan?
6015320	6016320	Do you like the boobies?
6016320	6017320	He's refusing to comment.
6017320	6028960	If O.L.R. and Howard Stern were to ever overlap, this is as far as it gets, except he would
6028960	6031520	have them in studio doing it in front of him.
6031520	6034400	Well, we're low budget.
6034400	6039440	I like this link from Tigerclaw sends us this link to a story here.
6039440	6044600	Reggie is wondering where the Metroid Other M sales went wrong.
6044600	6045600	Here's a quote.
6045600	6047440	Chew on this for a minute from Reggie Fils-Aime.
6047440	6051480	We believe that it could be, should be a million unit title.
6051480	6054080	We're not going to get there, not through the holiday.
6054080	6057520	And we are doing a lot of thinking as to why, because it's a great game.
6057520	6060480	The consumer reaction because of the quality has been strong.
6060480	6064560	I think the marketing was strong, advertising was very good, the social media we did was
6064560	6065560	very positive.
6065560	6068960	Yeah, and the story is crap.
6068960	6071600	Why is that?
6071600	6077120	So it kind of just sounds like they just, like, I.D.K., L.O.L., like, they're like,
6077120	6078120	it's a good game.
6078120	6080800	Why is it, like, they don't get at all why it didn't, it's not.
6080800	6082840	People actually care about the characterization.
6082840	6083840	Yeah.
6083840	6088280	I honestly think it more has to do with the fact that people are, like, the hardcore gamers
6088280	6089720	are kind of over the Wii.
6089720	6093440	Like, I get that this was a game to kind of throw a bone at the hardcore gamers, but I
6093440	6095240	think it was kind of too late.
6095240	6096240	They've moved on a while ago.
6096240	6100960	I think there's a lot of people like me who have put their Wii in a box.
6100960	6102240	Wii in a box.
6102240	6103560	It's my Wii in a box.
6103560	6104560	We're 12.
6104560	6107640	Should I bring out the booby video again?
6107640	6108640	All right.
6108640	6111640	I think you got a few more messages.
6111640	6115440	Hold on, I got another one here from, uh, another one from Tiger Claw.
6115440	6119960	Tiger, see, you know what's funny is that Tiger Claw actually sent us, like, five tweets.
6119960	6121240	No, wait, four.
6121240	6124320	But what happened is that the other two were stories we covered a minute ago, so he was
6124320	6127920	like, oh, I know they're not going to read those, so I'm going to send new tweets.
6127920	6131520	Tiger Claw has, is working the Twitters.
6131520	6133760	He has the system down.
6133760	6134760	But I'll allow it.
6134760	6139920	Uh, anyhow, uh, let's see, Tiger Claw also sends us this, oh, the Wii patent infringement
6139920	6144320	investigation, the International Trade Commission is going to be moving forward looking this,
6144320	6148320	that the Wii system is actually infringing on patents, uh, held by Motiva.
6148320	6150120	Have you never heard of them?
6150120	6151120	They're in Ohio.
6151120	6156880	Well, anyhow, it's, uh, they're going to complete their investigation by March 5th, 2012.
6156880	6160960	There will be an initial determination on the matter by November 4th, 2011.
6160960	6164320	Yeah, by that time, I'm sure the new Wii will be announced.
6164320	6165320	2012.
6165320	6166320	Well, we'll see.
6166320	6167320	I don't know.
6167320	6168320	Maybe not.
6168320	6169320	It'll be called the what?
6169320	6170320	The what?
6170320	6171320	The what?
6171320	6172320	So there you go.
6172320	6176920	Uh, and by the way, just, just for historical purposes, Nintendo did win an appeal of a
6176920	6180960	2008 decision where they were supposed to pay 21 million dollars to Anescape over the
6180960	6182800	Wavebird wireless controller.
6182800	6185940	So, uh, Nintendo has a good track record on these cases.
6185940	6186940	We'll see.
6186940	6190800	Oh, it looks like ShermeyOLR has been tweeting us here.
6190800	6193640	ShermeyOLR sent us a tweet that says Rob's feet smell funny.
6193640	6194640	Thanks for that.
6194640	6196640	I appreciate that, DarkSakura, because I know that was you.
6196640	6197640	Tell Shermey.
6197640	6200920	I sent it telepathically to my brain that made it up.
6200920	6201920	Whatever.
6201920	6202920	Whatever.
6202920	6205880	She's gotta sit there and smell your feet all during the show.
6205880	6206880	Trick or treat.
6206880	6207880	Smell my feet.
6207880	6209880	She's a very patient little girl.
6209880	6210880	Alright.
6210880	6217840	Um, I don't know if we are still streaming because our Winamp is frozen here on our side.
6217840	6221280	Um, so we're gonna just ride it out and see what happens.
6221280	6225080	Uh, we're gonna keep taping for podcasts, so let's keep moving.
6225080	6227480	Uh, we'll get into some more gaming news.
6227480	6228560	That's it for the Twitters tonight.
6228560	6229560	Disconnected.
6229560	6231640	Thank you guys.
6231640	6233120	Are we disconnected right now?
6233120	6234120	Okay.
6234120	6235120	I will-
6235120	6236120	The IRC just disconnected.
6236120	6237120	Okay, I'll reconnect us, guys.
6237120	6238120	Yeah, it's got kicked off too.
6238120	6239120	Alright.
6239120	6240120	Got it.
6240120	6241120	The live radio happens.
6241120	6242120	Let's keep moving.
6242120	6243120	Just get into the next story.
6243120	6244120	I'll restart the stream.
6244120	6245120	Okay.
6245120	6246560	Um, let's see.
6246560	6248680	Well, this is kind of interesting.
6248680	6254280	Well, not too surprising, but Black Ops sold a lot, I guess.
6254280	6260680	Um, they are now calling it the largest entertainment launch in history.
6260680	6269520	It sold 5.6 million units in the US and the UK and grossed $360 million in sales for the
6269520	6272120	first 24 hours.
6272120	6281120	And apparently you want to compare that to last year's where it was 4.7 million units
6281120	6283480	during the launch for Modern Warfare 2.
6283480	6286520	So quite an increase from last year.
6286520	6292360	And of course, to go along with that, Activision is saying that Call of Duty's download content
6292360	6295560	will be the largest digital offering ever.
6295560	6296560	Alright.
6296560	6300320	Sorry to interrupt, but thanks to the live drama going on.
6300320	6301520	Okay, so here's what happened.
6301520	6303200	Our show went down for whatever reason.
6303200	6305860	We had an internet clog or whatever.
6305860	6309360	So we all get kicked from the chat room and then we all rejoin it while our ghosts are
6309360	6310360	in there.
6310360	6314320	We ran from the chat network, but at least our feed's back up and running.
6314320	6315560	But unfortunately we're not in chat.
6315560	6317000	I'll hop in chat in an hour.
6317000	6320000	I can get you on IRC real quick if you want to switch places.
6320000	6321960	Oh, yeah, you can do the whole backdoor thing.
6321960	6322960	So why don't you...
6322960	6323960	I'm gonna let...
6323960	6328040	Well, let me do the next story after Loki's done here and then I'll move into that.
6328040	6329040	Oh, I'm done.
6329040	6330040	Oh, sorry.
6330040	6333400	So what do you think?
6333400	6335880	Why do you think this game is doing so phenomenally well?
6335880	6339040	Here, actually, this is what I wanted to chew on a little bit here is that wasn't there
6339040	6342040	supposed to be this whole backlash because of the Infinity Ward stuff that happened,
6342040	6344680	which I think everyone had agreed was kind of fucked up?
6344680	6348080	Like, wasn't there supposed to be this huge backlash against the game that didn't really
6348080	6350480	end up happening or what?
6350480	6357720	Yeah, probably pretty similar to the backlash, you know, that was supposed to happen with,
6357720	6362640	you know, what, Left 4 Dead 2, remember?
6362640	6365680	So I don't know.
6365680	6369120	Why do you think games like these are doing extremely well?
6369120	6377400	What is it about this genre of video game that really attracts people, you think?
6377400	6380960	People like their first-person shooters, and especially something that has such a strong
6380960	6386680	online component to it, you know, that's why they're all over games like Halo Reach and
6386680	6392680	you know, Modern Warfare 2, and of course Black Ops and whatnot, especially, you know,
6392680	6398960	more realistic shooters, you know, that have real military weapons in them and stuff.
6398960	6402280	It's just, it's the perfect storm, I guess.
6402280	6407440	But it's funny, though, because even though it's a Treyarch game, usually it's like,
6407440	6415040	oh, Treyarch, Call of Duty, ugh, but yet they still buy it, and lots of it.
6415040	6417600	Is it just the name that's attached to it, or what's the deal?
6417600	6422520	Yeah, I think franchise definitely helps, but yeah, it's just funny.
6422520	6423520	Interesting.
6423520	6436280	Um, it's GameSurge.net, sorry, we're trying to work on technical difficulties here, IRC.GameSurge.net.
6436280	6438040	But that is the IRC network we're on.
6438040	6441240	If you want to join us, if you don't, for whatever reason, want to connect to our website
6441240	6444400	at chat.orangehonestrated.com.
6444400	6447600	You could be uncool and not go in our chat room.
6447600	6449240	I know.
6449240	6451240	All the cool kids are there except us.
6451240	6455200	Well, how about, how about something else in news?
6455200	6456200	Sure.
6456200	6461080	Rob, I think that this might make you roll your eyes and go, what?
6461080	6462080	Okay.
6462080	6466560	U.K. retailers are deciding that they don't like Steam.
6466560	6473400	They actually are going to try to boycott Steam effectively.
6473400	6477400	One of them is quoted as saying, if we have a digital service, then I don't want to start
6477400	6481240	selling a rival in store.
6481240	6485880	So basically they're saying that not only are you competing, you know, with your product
6485880	6490560	in the store, but you've got rivals in there as well that could be taking your market and
6490560	6493640	you can do a side by side comparison for price.
6493640	6495880	Took them long enough to realize this, by the way.
6495880	6496880	Yeah.
6496880	6500120	Well, and you know, that's the same thing that was going on with Apple and now it's
6500120	6502080	going to be going on with Steam.
6502080	6506640	Although honestly, from a consumer point of view, I love Steam.
6506640	6509120	I do too because of all the sales they always do on there.
6509120	6510120	It's great.
6510120	6511120	Yeah.
6511120	6514320	And pre-orders and getting to play Join Trill.
6514320	6516880	I mean, I mean, I didn't say that, did I?
6516880	6517880	Hey, I'm back in chat.
6517880	6518880	Hooray.
6518880	6519880	Thank you, Alan, for hooking that up.
6519880	6520880	Chat.orangecountry.com.
6520880	6527280	ActDeaf says U.K. retailers equals stupid, so damn stupid.
6527280	6528280	I don't know though.
6528280	6533200	I mean, if I were a retailer and you know, I'm practically selling this program that
6533200	6537800	is going to install a store that makes it easier to take sales away from me, I don't
6537800	6538800	know.
6538800	6540680	I think they have a right to not sell it.
6540680	6544120	I mean, it's a tricky line to balance though.
6544120	6550000	It's up to them, but honestly, I mean, they're going between the easy sale and market profit,
6550000	6553660	whatever to the what's going to be better for them in the long term.
6553660	6556920	And I don't even know that that's still going to be good for them in the long term.
6556920	6561360	So GameGuru in our chat room says, so they aren't going to sell Civ 5 and Call of Duty.
6561360	6562360	That's a good point.
6562360	6567680	I mean, you get such huge releases included, it's hard to like not have it.
6567680	6568680	You know what I mean?
6568680	6572800	And honestly, I think that Steam would facilitate more sales, at least in those big titles,
6572800	6577240	but I can see smaller developers maybe, well, honestly though, it's still a friend of smaller
6577240	6582400	developers too, because they come up as budget games, so I'm just saying.
6582400	6583400	All right.
6583400	6588720	Well, anyhow, let me talk about a new sales model that's out there from THQ.
6588720	6593320	Apparently, they've decided that $39.99 is the place to be.
6593320	6599120	Hey, this doesn't sound so bad, although careful, there might be kind of a but here.
6599120	6600120	Here's the deal.
6600120	6605440	This is a quote from the Capital Markets Conference from THQ President Brian Farrell.
6605440	6609640	Quote, what we're thinking about the business is we're turning it on its head a little bit.
6609640	6613520	It's not how high can a price we get, but how many users.
6613520	6619200	So when we launched MX versus ATV at $59.99, we do some units, and then when we brought
6619200	6623840	the price down to the mass market friendly price of $39.99, it would just pop.
6623840	6627660	So the thinking at this time is, let's initially launch at $39.99.
6627660	6632400	It's a AAA title at that price point, but then win a series of DLCs so people can extend
6632400	6633400	their experience.
6633400	6634400	Hmm.
6634400	6639080	Isn't THQ also one of those companies that does the $10 online thing?
6639080	6641080	Yes.
6641080	6645280	But doesn't that seem to sting a lot less when they're only charging $40 for the game
6645280	6646640	to begin with?
6646640	6650920	Well, $10 online is only if you buy the game used.
6650920	6652440	True, true.
6652440	6657120	Well, I mean, I'm liking this idea of the fact that maybe the game will only cost $40,
6657120	6659120	you know?
6659120	6662680	It's a nice idea.
6662680	6666680	We've heard a lot about this kind of stuff, though, is that games tend to sell, I mean,
6666680	6671800	this is kind of a duh, but some games, I should say, have really sold better after a price
6671800	6672800	reduction, right?
6672800	6673800	Yeah.
6673800	6675160	Like, DJ Hero was an example.
6675160	6677160	We had the first DJ Hero game.
6677160	6681880	Didn't sell too hot for a few, but then they cut the price and it sells a lot.
6681880	6684480	Interesting, huh?
6684480	6685480	Mm-hmm.
6685480	6691040	So, that could be interesting if it starts this new trend, although, I don't know, you
6691040	6694360	know, they have to make back their money, but I think the guy makes a good point.
6694360	6699280	If you have more users, even if it's a lower price, you still end up making the same amount
6699280	6701160	of money, right?
6701160	6702280	Maybe even more.
6702280	6707720	Well, and they're saying more opportunity for DLC, because if you have, you know, two
6707720	6713320	users that are willing to buy the game for $39.99, and, you know, versus, you know, one
6713320	6720440	person that wants to buy it for, you know, $59.99, then you have the opportunity to sell
6720440	6725080	two $10 DLCs, or multiple $10 DLCs.
6725080	6726080	Good point.
6726080	6729080	Ooh, Robert M. has a really good comment in our chatroom at chat.orangewise.com.
6729080	6735760	Would the original Katamari have been as successful at more than $20?
6735760	6736760	Good point.
6736760	6739520	That's what really drove sales of that first game, was the fact that it was a $20 game,
6739520	6743200	and everybody was like, you gotta get this Katamari game, it's only 20 bucks, it's awesome.
6743200	6746800	But if it had been a, you know, $50 game or whatever they were charging at the time, would
6746800	6748480	it have been as exciting?
6748480	6751120	I don't know.
6751120	6752720	Hmm.
6752720	6753720	So anyhow.
6753720	6755200	Loki, what do you have for us?
6755200	6757260	Ah, yes.
6757260	6763800	So there's more fun stuff we can talk about, and this is more THQ-related things.
6763800	6768160	I don't know if I should be excited or disappointed that they're planning on doing this, but Saints
6768160	6772680	Row apparently is gonna become a movie, according to THQ.
6772680	6778520	They're gonna be announcing it next month, although they've just announced it, I don't
6778520	6779520	know, I guess officially.
6779520	6782520	So they've announced that an announcement is coming?
6782520	6783960	Um, yes.
6783960	6791120	And so apparently, I guess, they're gonna have some sort of movie coming out.
6791120	6794400	I think it's gonna be kind of cool, because, you know, Saints Row, unlike Grand Theft Auto,
6794400	6799960	it does have like a single storyline that goes along, whereas Grand Theft Auto is kind
6799960	6801800	of all over the place.
6801800	6804280	So it could work, perhaps.
6804280	6807760	I definitely think that they should get the people that did the voice acting for the game,
6807760	6811880	you know, kind of in there, so that would be kind of cool.
6811880	6814840	But I'd probably go see it.
6814840	6817000	What would you want to see most in a Saints Row movie?
6817000	6818280	How about a good plot?
6818280	6819280	A musical.
6819280	6822120	Um, yeah, a good plot would be nice.
6822120	6823120	Nudity!
6823120	6826440	Nudity would be fine, yeah, I don't know.
6826440	6828440	Random glitches.
6828440	6835600	Um, yeah, it could be interesting, I don't know, I would like to see just some of the
6835600	6840080	main characters that they have in the game, um, make a return.
6840080	6844280	Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're gonna get into the mailbag, because
6844280	6848160	we read your emails every week here on the show, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6848160	6849160	We do.
6849160	6850160	Yeah, we do.
6850160	6851160	You better get that ready.
6851160	6855440	Alright, but anyhow, I wanna read this article here, this is something that Kotaku ran with
6855440	6861360	earlier this week about the Wii 2, and how it, uh, really isn't necessarily gonna happen
6861360	6866800	in 2011, but is that just because they really aren't gonna announce one in 2011, or because
6866800	6870320	they just don't wanna cannibalize sales here in 2010?
6870320	6874120	And there was a bit of talk with Reggie Fils-Aime, and let me read you some of the, uh, quotes
6874120	6878520	here, because Kotaku actually kind of asked Reggie about this and said, Wii 2 is not a
6878520	6880120	must for next holiday?
6880120	6881860	And he said, no.
6881860	6884920	But you sort of expect that that answer's coming, because when you announce the Wii
6884920	6887400	2, then people are gonna stop buying the Wii.
6887400	6892320	Um, Reggie did say, by the way, that the Wii's sales have, uh, peaked in the system's third
6892320	6893320	year.
6893320	6895940	There are more than 30 million Wiis out there right now.
6895940	6900560	He also has these charts and things that show that the Wii is selling now faster than the
6900560	6904440	PlayStation 2 was at the same point in time.
6904440	6907360	23% faster, if you wanna be exact.
6907360	6908360	Hmm.
6908360	6913560	So, anyhow, uh, the Wii 2, um, might come in Christmas 2011, but it's all speculation
6913560	6914600	right now.
6914600	6918740	Of course, Nintendo's really gonna be behind the 3DS next year, we know that.
6918740	6922000	One interesting other note that Reggie did leave, uh, the interview on.
6922000	6926320	As we sit here today, we're saying the Wii has many, many more units to sell.
6926320	6930740	After we've reached an install base of 45 million units in the US, then we can have
6930740	6933080	a conversation about the next generation.
6933080	6934320	Hmm.
6934320	6937000	I guess we can see kind of where their goals are at.
6937000	6938080	But I don't know, what do you guys think?
6938080	6940080	Do they need to announce a Wii 2 next year?
6940080	6941080	It prints money!
6941080	6945400	They don't need a new Wii lease.
6945400	6947080	Wii Reese.
6947080	6951240	They need a system that's better.
6951240	6956080	I think, uh, this is funny, cause to me, this and the whole why isn't Metroid selling thing
6956080	6959200	go hand in hand to me.
6959200	6963180	And I think the next Wii, one thing Nintendo does pretty well these days is the backwards
6963180	6966160	compatibility thing, the next Wii will be like a super Wii.
6966160	6969120	It's gonna be a Wii that runs on HD and it uses all the same stuff.
6969120	6970120	You know what?
6970120	6975560	This is my thing, with that comment and everything, the why isn't this selling?
6975560	6978800	It's not really that he's being that dumb.
6978800	6983080	It's trying to talk it up so that people will go out and buy it.
6983080	6987640	I mean, it's just more, we believe in our product, we stand behind it, even though they
6987640	6991000	may be sitting in a boardroom going, what the hell were they thinking when they wrote
6991000	6992000	the story for this game?
6992000	6995680	How can you people be so stupid to not buy this amazing video game?
6995680	6996680	Exactly.
6996680	7000800	Going to our chat at chat dot orange launch radio dot com, uh, Casey says, so now they
7000800	7003960	are treating their home consoles like they're handhelds with the replacing them with a new
7003960	7005760	version of the same thing.
7005760	7009600	Well, there was all that talk that the Wii was just a souped up GameCube, but at the
7009600	7014840	same time, the Wii is the most successful console ever, per sales.
7014840	7017640	I mean, as much as we sit here and give it a hard time and as much as you might roll
7017640	7023440	your eyes at games like Metroid Other M, uh, money is what money is.
7023440	7029800	Let's see, uh, also, um, saying this, uh, GameGuru in our chat room says they want 3DS
7029800	7033560	to have this Christmas and save Wii 2 for 2012.
7033560	7037440	I think 3DS for this Christmas, meaning really Christmas 2011.
7037440	7038720	And that could very well be the case.
7038720	7043160	I think the 3DS will really be where it's at next year, but, and it'll print money.
7043160	7044160	Right?
7044160	7045160	Salacious Pop?
7045160	7046160	It'll print money.
7046160	7047160	Yes.
7047160	7048160	All right.
7048160	7052040	Let's go to the email bag, mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com is where you send your
7052040	7056320	emails every week, dark soccer will dive into the mailbag head first and pull out some of
7056320	7059120	her favorite emails and read them for you right now.
7059120	7064400	One of them, um, I'm not going to read the email, um, but in regards to the contest to
7064400	7071680	get the code for symphony of the night for Xbox live arcade, I said specifically not
7071680	7079000	orange lounge radio, who is it that is he who shall not be named on comic insanity.
7079000	7086280	It's called cross promotion as in you kind of got to go listen to both podcasts if you're
7086280	7088060	going to win.
7088060	7089840	So no, yes ma'am.
7089840	7094040	You're automatically disqualified for not following the rules.
7094040	7095040	I don't know.
7095040	7097660	I might give you another chance.
7097660	7101200	Way to scare off the listeners.
7101200	7105840	I heard the story about GameStop that had the call of duty black ops.
7105840	7110800	I shop at that store, but the story confuses me.
7110800	7115080	Why would this particular robbery about my little town make all of the game blogs?
7115080	7118580	The only thing I can think of is that it promotes call of duty.
7118580	7123880	So the story by making the rounds is inadvertently condoning the robbery for the sake of advertisement.
7123880	7127680	The store is actually pretty nice and in a nice area.
7127680	7129200	It's odd that it was robbed.
7129200	7133800	The highways allow for a very quick trip to I 95 and probably made it to the street vendors
7133800	7136320	in New York City and D.C. by Sunday.
7136320	7137320	Later rob a book.
7137320	7139320	I can actually think of a lot of answers to the questions.
7139320	7141680	Why was it so important?
7141680	7147000	Well, it probably wasn't in the scope of things, but think about it made the news for the same
7147000	7152000	reason that all these murders that involve fights over Xbox controllers and stuff make
7152000	7153000	news.
7153000	7155960	I mean, it just kind of remotely has to do with video games and so people talk about
7155960	7156960	it.
7156960	7162340	Also, it was probably all over the place because you said it happened in a place you didn't
7162340	7166820	expect it to happen and when these sorts of things happens in places where, you know,
7166820	7167860	you kind of go, wow, really?
7167860	7168860	It happens there.
7168860	7169860	People setting fire.
7169860	7170860	Makes people talk.
7170860	7176600	In the back of a GameStop slash Macy's in Roseville and you can still see the broken
7176600	7177600	roof.
7177600	7180960	And because that was like a super nice mall, if that had happened at Florin Mall, it would
7180960	7183960	have been just like, oh, Sunday.
7183960	7184960	Seriously.
7184960	7190880	But, well, I mean, I worked at GNC and got held up at gunpoint.
7190880	7195000	This guy was going around and hitting GNCs.
7195000	7198260	It was my first job when I moved out here.
7198260	7201180	So I was like, dude, you suck.
7201180	7207360	Those giant tubs of bulk gainer 4,000 are like 60 bucks a bottle, so they got money.
7207360	7211640	The moron came after I had done a deposit in the safe.
7211640	7214200	And yeah, I could get into the safe, but I just said, dude, we've got a safe.
7214200	7215760	I can't get into it.
7215760	7217140	It's on time lock.
7217140	7218140	It's I can't get in.
7218140	7224240	When, when, when I'm in panic mode, I either will go completely crazy or completely calm.
7224240	7225320	And I went completely calm.
7225320	7226960	And so I could like write down the make of his gun.
7226960	7227960	What he looked like.
7227960	7228960	I drew the guy for the cops.
7228960	7229960	It was kind of fun.
7229960	7230960	That's awesome.
7230960	7231960	And they caught him.
7231960	7232960	Good times.
7232960	7238640	Like what idiot robs a GNC is the same thing as what idiot robs a GameStop in an ice area.
7238640	7241920	Anyway, what idiot burns down a GameStop in a nice mall?
7241920	7244480	Oh, this guy was on the drugs.
7244480	7250400	Well, and every news station in the entirety of Northern California and CNN, probably.
7250400	7256160	This one person on this Facebook, his friend of his says, dude, you are stupid on his Facebook.
7256160	7260920	A guy that I was sitting next to in my magazine thing, went to high school with him.
7260920	7261920	Oh, random.
7261920	7262920	Yeah.
7262920	7263920	Okay.
7263920	7264920	Next one.
7264920	7268940	Just to ask an actually intelligent question for change with the latest incarnations of
7268940	7272080	these games are reasonably recently published.
7272080	7276480	What do you think was the most influential for defining the console first person genre,
7276480	7278040	Halo or Goldeneye?
7278040	7282440	Or as the giant bomb guys were discussing Call of Duty 4 for its multiplayer structure
7282440	7283440	or none of the above.
7283440	7286960	Thanks as always, Robert M. I'm going to say Goldeneye right off the bat and Goldeneye
7286960	7290760	did have multiplayer.
7290760	7291920	Slow down for me.
7291920	7296360	The question is console first person shooter the most impactful on consoles?
7296360	7301480	What was more influential for defining the console first person genre?
7301480	7304400	Halo or Goldeneye or Call of Duty 4?
7304400	7309440	I would say Halo 2 because of online Xbox Live.
7309440	7315280	And I think that really set the stage for everything after it was Xbox Live.
7315280	7318920	Not the original Halo didn't have Xbox Live, but Halo 2, I think was Xbox Live.
7318920	7322440	I still say Duke Nukem 3D.
7322440	7328100	But then when I go influential first person shooters, honestly, I go back to PC games
7328100	7336560	because my mind says, but, but, but, but Quake and Half Life and Doom and Wolfenstein 3D
7336560	7337560	really.
7337560	7340680	Quake 3 was out on Dreamcast with internet play.
7340680	7342000	Interesting.
7342000	7346640	So still, though, not quite the impact, I think, of the Halo 2 on Xbox Live.
7346640	7350000	But Halo was by no means the first.
7350000	7351000	No.
7351000	7352000	Oh, no.
7352000	7354800	Well, Super, I'm sorry, Wolfenstein 3D was on Super Nintendo.
7354800	7358680	But in the US, the Satellaview thing never went through.
7358680	7364360	But I'm saying, you know, I'm going for talking about online play on a console.
7364360	7367560	And I don't really think that there were first person, you know, shooters like that that
7367560	7373400	played through the Satellaview or through the Genesis Link.
7373400	7379120	But for Dreamcast, Quake 3 was like the big modem game that you played.
7379120	7382880	PSO didn't work on the US one.
7382880	7388560	First, first person shooters that ended up on console were usually ports that came from
7388560	7389560	the PC.
7389560	7393680	First, sold a couple million copies and then, okay, now there's a console version where
7393680	7395320	they tweak the controls.
7395320	7401440	Goldeneye is the first one that was relevant for consoles where it was a console exclusive.
7401440	7405320	And because we've gone into the whole fight before about how I only play first person
7405320	7408940	shooters on a PC because I need a keyboard and mouse.
7408940	7411720	When Goldeneye came out, I was like, okay, this is on console.
7411720	7415680	I'm going to sit and figure out how to play this game because it's awesome.
7415680	7420400	So I think Goldeneye is really the first one that made console first person shooters like
7420400	7422040	stand out.
7422040	7426780	I got to give this one a shout out, though, even though the game was kind of crap.
7426780	7430720	It was a really early type of first person game called Baseball 2000.
7430720	7431720	Does anyone remember this one?
7431720	7432720	Yes, I remember Baseball 2000.
7432720	7435960	It was a Game Boy game, I believe, and they had it on Super Nintendo.
7435960	7440360	And it was the whole, like, it was a very rudimentary shooter game.
7440360	7444400	I only throw that out there not because necessarily it was a great game, but because it was kind
7444400	7452280	of the first type of maze, shoot your opponents type of thing that was only on consoles.
7452280	7455880	But I wouldn't recommend you, like, run out and find a copy because it was kind of shit.
7455880	7461100	It was a lot of crap, but you know, but for me, my first LAN experience was playing Duke
7461100	7462100	Nukem 3D.
7462100	7463100	Oh, yeah, Duke Nukem.
7463100	7464100	Oh, man.
7464100	7465100	That was crazy.
7465100	7466100	At my first Mobicon.
7466100	7469780	Oh, and one more first person type of game, even though it was a multiplayer.
7469780	7473800	Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo in all its surround sound glory, because those first
7473800	7476320	person shooter phases scare the crap out of me.
7476320	7479960	What if Velociraptor would run up behind you in all his pixelated open mouth glory?
7479960	7487720	I love that voice, you sound like Chewbacca.
7487720	7488720	So there you go.
7488720	7491360	There's a variety of first person shooter games for you.
7491360	7494720	I think all of those have had impact in different ways.
7494720	7495720	Was that it for emails?
7495720	7496720	No.
7496720	7497720	Oh.
7497720	7498720	Well, then what's next?
7498720	7500040	Just assuming, huh?
7500040	7501040	Well.
7501040	7502600	Ignoring our poor listeners.
7502600	7503720	Well.
7503720	7505660	Dear OLR.
7505660	7507000	Dear listener.
7507000	7511040	I was listening to Episode 388, and while listening to your discussion of the recently
7511040	7515840	announced delay of Chinese Democracy, I was mortified by the derision I heard.
7515840	7519960	Sure Chinese Democracy was supposed to be a PS3 launch game, and sure Chinese Democracy
7519960	7525440	is touted as the best racing game of all time, but how does any of that change with another
7525440	7526440	delay?
7526440	7527440	Oh, I see what you're doing.
7527440	7528440	Yes.
7528440	7532560	Chinese Democracy is like a girlfriend you have that unexpectedly moves to India.
7532560	7537360	Yes, she keeps on extending her stay in India, but she does send you saucy pictures every
7537360	7541180	so often, so she keeps on delaying her return home, and yes, she does occasionally call
7541180	7546440	you Tom, but is any of that any reason to break up with her?
7546440	7549120	I will make a bold declaration here and now.
7549120	7552480	Chinese Democracy will come out this calendar year.
7552480	7556440	I will go one step further when Chinese Democracy is released this year.
7556440	7562000	What if, but when, I will buy each and every person in the all-games community a bottle
7562000	7563000	of Dr. Pepper?
7563000	7564000	Nasty.
7564000	7566040	Hey, I like Dr. Pepper.
7566040	7567040	You're welcome to it.
7567040	7570360	I am that confident in Chinese Democracy coming out this year.
7570360	7572160	Stay black, redertainment.
7572160	7577320	There's a note, offer valid only to residents of the continuous, I think it means continental,
7577320	7580480	United States, and contingent on Loki wearing the tingle costume.
7580480	7581480	Oops.
7581480	7584120	But he didn't say tinkle, he said tinkle.
7584120	7585120	Tinkle.
7585120	7588800	I don't think they were going to dress him up in yellow foil.
7588800	7591640	First off, I see what you did there.
7591640	7595920	Second off, you know what's funny, and this is so true, I get what you're trying to parallel,
7595920	7599100	and if you didn't pick up on it, obviously it's the Gran Turismo 5 thing, right?
7599100	7603200	But here's the funny thing that I think takes your parallel one step further.
7603200	7609000	When Chinese Democracy finally came out, no one cared anymore.
7609000	7610000	Just saying.
7610000	7613240	Well, I will say this.
7613240	7616400	It is going to be this year, from what I understand.
7616400	7617720	And no one cares anymore.
7617720	7625080	No, actually, that's wrong, because Dan and his cousin were just talking about it yesterday.
7625080	7626080	Two people care anymore.
7626080	7627080	Just kidding.
7627080	7629760	And we're talking about other people asking about it.
7629760	7631240	Ah, fine, fine, fine.
7631240	7632800	People do still care.
7632800	7637560	I don't think as many as would have cared two years ago.
7637560	7638560	But we'll see.
7638560	7641800	Sales will be where it is all at.
7641800	7663640	Now is the part of the show where we get angsty and rude and mad because, well, we can.
7663640	7672240	I'm giving a fork you to the culinary department at my school for, um, well, I was all excited
7672240	7676080	and giddy because even though they were a week past the deadline and getting me their
7676080	7683280	stuff, three of the recipes that they gave me were not even remotely related to any of
7683280	7684280	the pictures I got.
7684280	7689120	On top of that, the pictures were in 240 dpi and I needed them at least 300 dpi so I could
7689120	7690120	use them.
7690120	7693360	So now I've had to have people do stuff to the pictures for me, thank goodness I can
7693360	7697960	delegate this stuff so that I can use the pictures and I still can't use as many of
7697960	7700060	the recipes as I wanted to.
7700060	7705280	So they're gonna just gonna have to deal with only having three recipes in the damn magazine
7705280	7708720	because they couldn't get their crap together and if they do this crap next year, they don't
7708720	7709720	get a section.
7709720	7715520	I'm a little, I'm a little irritated at them and they also didn't give us a title for their
7715520	7718120	section so I'm gonna call it porky culinary.
7718120	7725080	I'm probably not, but that's what I feel.
7725080	7728080	Well tell us how you really feel.
7728080	7729080	Uh, Loki!
7729080	7735200	Um, I guess F you to, um, my JTAG system for being very finicky because it was red rained
7735200	7739600	actually earlier this week and I got it fixed and so I was like, ooh yeah, I can work back
7739600	7744480	on my, uh, Grand Theft Auto stuff and now it's doing this stupid E79 error crap.
7744480	7749040	I think that may go away though because that's supposed to be a firmware, like, glitch or,
7749040	7752480	you know, corrupted firmware or something and I'm updating the firmware anyways on it
7752480	7755920	so, uh, it's not a big deal, I guess.
7755920	7756920	But that's still something.
7756920	7759120	At least I know how to fix it.
7759120	7761360	Fix it by breaking it further.
7761360	7762360	That's science.
7762360	7766240	Uh, I want to give an F you to that salad I had for lunch.
7766240	7769120	I don't know what you did but, um, I didn't like it.
7769120	7773720	Uh, and then I want to give an F you to pink eye because it continues to destroy my life.
7773720	7777000	Um, apparently, I don't think I have it.
7777000	7779340	I'm always, I'm always paranoid I'm gonna get it again.
7779340	7782080	Apparently now there's like a big old outbreak in my work and a couple of my coworkers got
7782080	7783080	it too.
7783080	7784080	Although it took a week.
7784080	7785080	So...
7785080	7786080	I don't have it.
7786080	7787080	I don't have it.
7787080	7788680	And I'm thinking like, okay, but it took a week.
7788680	7791000	Something's wrong in my work, I think.
7791000	7794800	Like it wouldn't have taken a week for my coworkers to get it from me.
7794800	7802440	I think some disgruntled, uh, person, I'll say customer, came into the front door just
7802440	7804360	long enough to spread the infection.
7804360	7808640	I think we're just all becoming zombies, but like I'm here every time my eye itches, I'm
7808640	7810120	like, Oh my God, his big eye.
7810120	7811120	All right.
7811120	7812120	It's called allergies.
7812120	7814120	No, I don't think it's allergies.
7814120	7819660	Alan, do you have anything if you want to go?
7819660	7820660	Not really.
7820660	7821660	Had a pretty mellow week.
7821660	7823360	Well, F you to being so happy.
7823360	7827900	I guess F you to having to get up early tomorrow, like an employed person without actually having
7827900	7828900	a job.
7828900	7831840	These are real problems.
7831840	7832840	Yeah.
7832840	7833840	I know.
7833840	7834840	Right.
7834840	7835840	All right.
7835840	7840520	Let's move on to a couple more news stories and then your phone calls where anything can
7840520	7841520	happen.
7841520	7842520	Joy and rapture.
7842520	7843520	Loki, what do you have for us?
7843520	7844960	More rapture though.
7844960	7848160	Um, super Mario brothers three has actually been remade.
7848160	7856360	Uh, funny enough, it's a mod, uh, to the new super Mario brothers DS, um, game and they
7856360	7860200	did new super Mario brothers three and it's kind of cool.
7860200	7865040	It's a completely renewed, well, redone game for all the Mario brothers three levels plus
7865040	7870680	some additional challenge levels, uh, plus some actual like hybrid levels with like,
7870680	7875800	you know, the, um, Metroid stuff in there and all sorts of other crazy stuff.
7875800	7884880	Um, you can download the actual mod for the ROM, um, off of, uh, GBA temp.net and, uh,
7884880	7886960	it's actually pretty awesome looking.
7886960	7889400	I'm thinking about checking it out with my, uh,
7889400	7890800	wait, this is a ROM.
7890800	7891800	What system is this?
7891800	7898760	It's a mod for ROM for the DS, uh, have, you know, jail, not necessarily jailbreak device,
7898760	7905200	but like, you know, a device to play ROMs on your, like an R four, like an R four.
7905200	7906200	Yes.
7906200	7911160	You can download this and play it and it's pretty shady, but interesting.
7911160	7912160	I'm watching the video.
7912160	7913160	It's really sweet.
7913160	7914160	Hmm.
7914160	7915160	Yeah, it's pretty sweet.
7915160	7922080	It looks like they had to do a few creative liberties, but still, uh, you know, overall
7922080	7923080	very impressive.
7923080	7924080	Mm hmm.
7924080	7926440	Good for them.
7926440	7930620	How many, how long till Nintendo sues?
7930620	7933540	At least they didn't say new Super Mario brothers three.
7933540	7934540	It's on like don't.
7934540	7937800	So in that case you want to get, well, the fact that it's been on the internet longer
7937800	7942100	than a day, it'll never go away.
7942100	7943100	Everyone has it now.
7943100	7946400	Well, then a follow up to something we were discussing just a minute ago.
7946400	7950100	I think this is an appropriate last main story for tonight.
7950100	7956360	Gran Turismo five has a release date and I would like my Dr Pepper please.
7956360	7959920	November 24th is the day.
7959920	7966240	This is coming from a polyphony digital's Kazunori Yamauchi did we not call it satisfying
7966240	7970200	the loyal Gran Turismo followers is at the heart of all our efforts, which is why it
7970200	7973920	was such a difficult decision to delay the release of the release of the game and one
7973920	7975400	which you did not take lightly.
7975400	7978760	I can only apologize to everyone for making you wait so long and I hope that when you
7978760	7982720	try out the wealth of driving experiences available in Gran Turismo five, you will not
7982720	7984080	be disappointed.
7984080	7985080	So there it is.
7985080	7987200	November 24th is the big day.
7987200	7988880	That's um, really soon.
7988880	7994080	Was it 200 cars, 200 plus cars, 1033 cars.
7994080	7996320	Oh wow.
7996320	7998620	I want my Bugatti.
7998620	8000840	Can I race like my Honda Civic?
8000840	8007280	Can I just probably whatever the racing model would be good to have cart racing.
8007280	8008880	Nice and NASCAR, but no Mario Kart.
8008880	8010280	I just want my Bugatti.
8010280	8011280	I'll be happy.
8011280	8013020	Well, you don't have a track editor, Rob.
8013020	8016860	So maybe you will get Mario Kart.
8016860	8019840	If there's a track editor, then it's just a matter of time before Mario Kart circuit
8019840	8020840	shows up.
8020840	8021840	That's for sure.
8021840	8029840	So I guess we should go ahead and open up our Skype line, shall we one eight seven seven
8029840	8033100	game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
8033100	8035760	Give us a call right now during the show.
8035760	8038600	We are, oops, I should actually, Oh no, we are set to taking calls.
8038600	8039600	My bad.
8039600	8042320	One eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
8042320	8044300	The Skype line is open for business.
8044300	8045300	Give us a call.
8045300	8046300	We'll talk.
8046300	8048200	Meanwhile, uh, last minute stories.
8048200	8053520	Yes, and it was not even a week after the new dashboard came out and they've already
8053520	8057040	ported it over to J tag systems for the Xbox three 60.
8057040	8064320	So now all those people with J tags like myself can play, you know, connect games.
8064320	8070740	Of course, for people like me that bought a connect system with connect or a slim system
8070740	8079200	with connect, I had to order a really expensive adapter to play said thing on my old consoles.
8079200	8080200	You're so cryptic.
8080200	8081200	I love it.
8081200	8083640	Let's go to El Telefonos and take some calls.
8083640	8085240	Hi, you're on orange lounge radio.
8085240	8086240	Who's this?
8086240	8089440	It's the only listener with the fastest internet finger in the whole wide world.
8089440	8090440	Wrong.
8090440	8093080	Clearly you are the king of iron fingering finger.
8093080	8094080	What's on your mind?
8094080	8097880	Wait, well I can barely hear you guys.
8097880	8100880	You are the king of iron fingering.
8100880	8103000	I try.
8103000	8106680	What's up?
8106680	8107680	Did he just cut out?
8107680	8110360	Rama, you there?
8110360	8111360	I'm right here.
8111360	8112360	Hi.
8112360	8113360	What's on your mind?
8113360	8114360	Okay.
8114360	8117920	I don't know why you brought the whole family matters thing at the beginning of the show
8117920	8119840	because I can reference that and it's really sad.
8119840	8120840	Wait, wait, wait.
8120840	8121840	Hold on.
8121840	8123240	Didn't you hear us talking about the new cause or the, no, I'm sorry.
8123240	8124240	Not the Cosby's.
8124240	8129040	Yes, I did, and you also mentioned family matters as well.
8129040	8130040	Yes.
8130040	8131040	Okay.
8131040	8137480	To clear that up, the middle daughter, she only did two adult movies.
8137480	8138480	Only two?
8138480	8140480	Just two?
8140480	8142040	Hello.
8142040	8143520	Hello.
8143520	8147200	Oh, he's gone.
8147200	8148760	Oh well.
8148760	8152840	Man, he wanted to talk about pornography.
8152840	8153840	And that's the internet sensor.
8153840	8154840	I don't know if you can hear us.
8154840	8155840	We can't hear you.
8155840	8156840	All right.
8156840	8157840	He's been bleeped out.
8157840	8159320	I have to hang up on him.
8159320	8160320	I'm sorry, guys.
8160320	8161320	That was so dirty.
8161320	8162960	We had to bleep that out from our show.
8162960	8166960	I can't believe you and your language.
8166960	8167960	All right.
8167960	8172960	Well, apparently she was only ever actually in two movies, but you know, it's just like
8172960	8175440	the whole new Super Mario Brothers thing hitting the internet.
8175440	8179120	Once your vajay is on the internet, always on the internet.
8179120	8181680	Just ask Paris Hilton, right?
8181680	8184400	It was just that one little homemade porn they did.
8184400	8185400	Just one!
8185400	8187640	She's a talentless hack.
8187640	8189160	And I'm talking about the porno, too.
8189160	8194360	You know what's crazy is that how much money does she have now, and like, who was she before
8194360	8195440	that porn came out?
8195440	8200840	She sent an heiress to the Hilton Hotel, you know, Fortune or whatever.
8200840	8203040	And no one cared until we all saw her vajay.
8203040	8205680	And she was terrible at porn.
8205680	8206680	She was not good.
8206680	8211120	I give her a thumbs down.
8211120	8212120	You all right over there, Dark Soccer?
8212120	8213120	You fighting with something?
8213120	8215280	I hate this shit.
8215280	8218080	Let's go to the phones and try to take another call.
8218080	8219080	Hi, everyone.
8219080	8220080	Who's this?
8220080	8221640	Yes, it's Legend of Zaku here.
8221640	8222640	Hey, Legend of Zaku.
8222640	8223640	How are you doing?
8223640	8225960	Oh, pretty good as usual.
8225960	8230000	Just trying to like get in, you know, the phone calls before going to Betty Buys.
8230000	8231200	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
8231200	8236520	Anyways, I'd like to, I guess, I don't know if you brought it up about, you know, harmonics
8236520	8239320	getting put up on the market.
8239320	8242480	Why yes, it was our first story tonight.
8242480	8243480	So I don't know.
8243480	8248520	I'm thinking, I don't know what good will come out of like whoever else owns harmonics
8248520	8249520	at this point.
8249520	8254880	I mean, unless, of course, they go back to Activision, which is like a really, really
8254880	8255880	fucked up situation.
8255880	8259040	You know, I don't think it'll ever happen just because of battered white syndrome of
8259040	8262380	the experience, the whole guitar hero thing.
8262380	8267480	So I'm willing, you know, I was wondering, I guess we should propose like taking bests
8267480	8270760	to see who will be their next suitor.
8270760	8271760	It'll be EA.
8271760	8273200	Are you sure?
8273200	8274200	Yes.
8274200	8276160	I mean, what certainty do you have?
8276160	8277800	Because it logically makes sense.
8277800	8280240	EA has been publishing their games for a while.
8280240	8281360	What other suitors are there?
8281360	8285760	Bobby Kotick came out and said, I should have bought harmonics when I had the chance.
8285760	8287560	I underestimated them.
8287560	8290120	And you know, I think he's kind of already missed the boat on that one.
8290120	8294080	Konami, as much as the fanboys want that to happen, they can't afford it.
8294080	8296720	Ubisoft, I just don't, EA makes sense.
8296720	8299440	I've been surprised before.
8299440	8300480	Maybe I'll be surprised again.
8300480	8301480	Who knows?
8301480	8303720	It could be something completely fucking random like Sega.
8303720	8306520	Like could you, who knows?
8306520	8310600	But I'm thinking the Shumans are definitely, you're right, EA and then Konami.
8310600	8316160	Konami making more logical sense just because it'll pretty much rein in all the musical
8316160	8318880	game talent into one house.
8318880	8319880	It would be interesting.
8319880	8324960	But again, I think that's more of a fanboys dream because this might be a harsh thing
8324960	8330000	to say, but I'm not sure what musical talent house is left at Konami.
8330000	8333160	Poor Naoki Madaya is fighting for his life over there.
8333160	8337960	And you know, he's a great guy, really sweet, nice guy, but Dance Masters was extremely
8337960	8340360	rushed and mostly recycled.
8340360	8343520	Although I think Dance Masters 2 could be very interesting, I don't know if they'll
8343520	8346920	get the chance unless the game does really well in Japan, which it might.
8346920	8351920	Well, I mean, on one hand, you still have those old timers, the ones who basically started
8351920	8357840	the whole music game genre in Konami, you still have most of them still, you know, whatever's
8357840	8362360	left of them trying to see whether or not they can take, you know, if they make the
8362360	8367480	argument that maybe they should bring harmonics on board, then it will be in safer hands because
8367480	8371840	you know, you have a company that has a crap ton more experience with that whole genre
8371840	8378160	than EA would ever do in their history.
8378160	8380920	As much as we want to sit here and say it makes sense.
8380920	8386400	I just think it's a little bit of a wishful thinking and I honestly think EA is already
8386400	8388240	having those talks.
8388240	8392680	But then again, as long as EA doesn't rock the boat, you know, the idea is whoever buys
8392680	8397680	them has to give them the autonomy, the light of day to operate it as an independent company
8397680	8398680	in that sense.
8398680	8402800	Maybe it won't be such a terrible thing if EA buys them.
8402800	8404800	It may not be such a terrible thing if EA buys them.
8404800	8406880	EA has access to all the music.
8406880	8411080	On one hand, I wouldn't want EA to buy them just because I know it would be a lot better
8411080	8417280	than Activision or any other company that would just like, you know, drain them and
8417280	8421520	make them and whore them out every like every year for a single new release.
8421520	8423880	No, I think we can all agree not Activision.
8423880	8426760	No, yeah, of course, obviously.
8426760	8429800	They're going to milk that proverbial cap and that's pretty much what's killing that
8429800	8430800	genre.
8430800	8434880	You have companies that are going, you know, they're doing, you know, twice or three times
8434880	8439600	as worse as Konami has ever done in terms of milking out the franchise.
8439600	8443820	I know if one could argue, you could say the same thing with DDR, but there were certain
8443820	8449920	periods in that, you know, in that game's history where there was time in between any
8449920	8454360	major release, especially in the arcade versions.
8454360	8482120	And that goes to show, boys and girls, that you don't let any big corporate non-video
8482120	8487520	game company buy a video game company for the sake of doing it, because chances are,
8487520	8491600	I don't care if they have the best connections to your genre, they're going to, they're going
8491600	8493560	to pimp you out and bleed you dry.
8493560	8497400	Well, but here's the thing, I'm not so sure I totally agree with that.
8497400	8501560	Like I'm all for the whole like, I'm all for the idea of Fight the Man and all that stuff
8501560	8505320	and Stay Independent and all that, but I wonder if Rock Band would have been quite the cultural
8505320	8509640	phenomenon if it hadn't been attached to MTV and Viacom.
8509640	8514440	I'll tell you this much, that Beatles game would have never happened without the, that
8514440	8518080	Beatles game would never have happened without the Viacom.
8518080	8519640	You're right, yeah.
8519640	8523840	I mean, they have the connections, but on the other hand, they don't understand the
8523840	8526760	business, they don't understand the video game industry that well.
8526760	8531040	They just see it as something they could easily ride in the short term.
8531040	8534180	And now that they think they've ridden it to full term, because unfortunately the Beatles
8534180	8539760	game did not perform to expectations, but there's a whole variety of reasons why they
8539760	8540760	haven't.
8540760	8545120	Same thing with corporate America, it's mostly short-sighted, especially those guys at Viacom.
8545120	8548240	All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls.
8548240	8549240	Thank you very much.
8549240	8550240	Good one, though.
8550240	8551240	Take care.
8551240	8553240	Have a good one.
8553240	8554240	Bye-bye.
8554240	8561040	So, yeah, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangeallentrader.com, lots of good stuff
8561040	8566000	that we're getting in our chat room here.
8566000	8569720	Some folks are saying, AkumaJP says in our chat room, I'm not saying Konami is buying
8569720	8572160	anything, but Konami is not that small.
8572160	8574320	They're in a lot of businesses, not just games.
8574320	8579560	Here's my reasoning for saying that, is that I think a lot of that is very Japanese-based,
8579560	8584060	and Harmonix is also an American developer, and Konami has really scaled back their operations
8584060	8585060	here in America.
8585060	8590440	I mean, some of the best music stuff they were producing was out of Hawaii, gone, and
8590440	8591440	then Emeryville, gone.
8591440	8592920	Or, no, was it Emeryville?
8592920	8597840	No, they were in, somewhere in the North Bay, or Bay Area.
8597840	8598840	Not San Rafael.
8598840	8599840	They were...
8599840	8600840	San Leandro?
8600840	8601840	No, not San Leandro.
8601840	8602840	They were...
8602840	8603840	Tiburon?
8603840	8604840	No.
8604840	8605840	No, I think it was around San Rafael.
8605840	8606840	I thought.
8606840	8609840	Well, regardless, they were in the Bay, and now they're not anymore.
8609840	8611880	Was it in Redwood City or something?
8611880	8612880	Yeah.
8612880	8613880	Redwood City.
8613880	8614880	No, that's in Washington.
8614880	8615880	No.
8615880	8616880	No, that's Redmond, is Washington.
8616880	8617880	Redmond.
8617880	8618880	Yeah, no.
8618880	8619880	It's somewhere.
8619880	8620880	Yeah.
8620880	8624320	The point is, they've scaled back their American operations quite a bit, so unless they've
8624320	8629360	got the money to throw down to try and expand it again, I don't know if I see that happening.
8629360	8635840	Anyhow, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word if
8635840	8637280	you want to give us a call.
8637280	8639400	We're taking calls right now.
8639400	8642320	Any other last minute stories you want to get to, Loki, while we wait for some calls?
8642320	8644600	If any of you are going to come in?
8644600	8645600	Let's see.
8645600	8648800	Mushi Hime Sama, Bug Panic is coming out.
8648800	8649800	Hime.
8649800	8653800	Mushi Hime Sama, Bug Panic is coming out on iPhone.
8653800	8655600	Mushroom Princess.
8655600	8658120	November 18th.
8658120	8660680	I'm looking forward to that.
8660680	8662200	It's actually a cave adventure game.
8662200	8664760	That's the Castlevania person doing music, right?
8664760	8665760	Yes, it is.
8665760	8666760	I remember that from the previous show.
8666760	8674280	The actual Mushi Hime Sama is a shooter, but this is an adventure game.
8674280	8675280	Gotcha.
8675280	8676280	I have covered this.
8676280	8677280	All right.
8677280	8678280	Call us, people!
8678280	8679880	Call us, people!
8679880	8681960	It's still a shooter.
8681960	8684360	It's just she's running around instead.
8684360	8686000	Wow, it works.
8686000	8689400	Like right as she said that, DarkSakura, our phones started lighting off the hook.
8689400	8690400	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8690400	8691400	Who's this?
8691400	8692400	Hey, this is X-Link.
8692400	8694120	Hey, it's like all our regular callers tonight.
8694120	8695120	What's on your mind, buddy?
8695120	8696120	Hey, not much.
8696120	8698400	I'm making it short and sweet.
8698400	8701800	What kind of games are you looking forward to this holiday season?
8701800	8702800	Hmm.
8702800	8706680	Well, definitely the WoW nerd in me is excited for Cataclysm.
8706680	8707680	I think that's a duh.
8707680	8710560	I think, otherwise, most of them have come out now.
8710560	8713800	I think Kinect was one of the things I was looking forward to with Dance Central and
8713800	8714800	all that.
8714800	8715800	Very interesting.
8715800	8719720	Civ V was certainly one that I was looking forward to as well, and now that's already
8719720	8720720	happened.
8720720	8725160	Otherwise, you know, we're not looking at a lot of big games that I'm interested in
8725160	8731240	because of the fact that we have the console evolutions, if you will, between the Move
8731240	8735440	and the Kinect.
8735440	8737960	As far as the Wii goes, though, sadly, not a lot.
8737960	8740840	The other thing I'm really looking forward to is the 3DS, and sadly, they didn't make
8740840	8742840	it for this holiday, but next year.
8742840	8745080	Will you be playing it?
8745080	8747880	Because I know you're not really big in handheld games.
8747880	8748880	You know what?
8748880	8751080	I'm not, but the 3DS was something else.
8751080	8755160	The 3DS brings me something that I can't get on my TV.
8755160	8758480	Do you think just by getting it, you're going to be doing it because...
8758480	8760840	I'm not sure you said because of the hype, but it's going to be one of those things where
8760840	8763960	you're like, oh, I want to play it, and then after you play, you're like, okay, I played
8763960	8767720	it, and kind of like Wii and the rest of these systems, and just put it aside, and it's like
8767720	8768720	this?
8768720	8770800	Uh, probably.
8770800	8774960	But there's also that part of me that's kind of like, as a gaming enthusiast, this is definitely
8774960	8777920	something really new for games.
8777920	8778920	Well, I guess...
8778920	8782680	Yeah, I mean, you could say, well, what about Rad Racer and the Virtual Boy?
8782680	8783680	But I don't know.
8783680	8789920	Something about the 3DS, I think, is going to really resonate with people the way these
8789920	8792480	things of the past haven't.
8792480	8796200	I think just part of it as a gaming fanatic, I kind of owe it to myself to pick one up.
8796200	8797200	Yeah.
8797200	8800640	Are you going to pick it up on day one?
8800640	8804640	Most likely, because if that Kid Icarus game is coming out day one, which I don't see why
8804640	8809240	it wouldn't be, again, I really have to have that.
8809240	8812780	Somebody who's loved that game since it was out back in the day.
8812780	8816640	Are you afraid possibly the Kid Icarus games are going to turn into the Metroid M?
8816640	8820800	I haven't played Metroid M. I'm not so sold on the fact that it's as terrible as everyone's
8820800	8823960	making it out to be, but I'm also a Metroid fanboy.
8823960	8828360	Yeah, of course, there's always the possibility the game's going to be terrible.
8828360	8833480	So I guess I'll weigh some of the early reviews and early impressions, but I don't think that'll
8833480	8835240	stop me from eventually wanting to pick it up.
8835240	8840280	I mean, most Nintendo first-party games are still pretty solid.
8840280	8844480	It's very rare that Nintendo puts out a first-party stinker.
8844480	8848000	Let's not forget Other M isn't a first-party game.
8848000	8849800	I mean, it is and it isn't.
8849800	8850880	You know what I mean?
8850880	8855240	So most games that Nintendo does in-house themselves are pretty darn good.
8855240	8861640	I mean, they have made some stinkers and some things that were better on paper than they
8861640	8865420	were in-game, like Nintendogs.
8865420	8869720	But Nintendogs also really called out to a certain audience that just wasn't me, you
8869720	8870720	know?
8870720	8872720	Little kids love Nintendogs.
8872720	8875240	And get mauled by them, too, because they're playing them.
8875240	8877900	Yes, I remember that story from a few weeks ago.
8877900	8880920	What about you, XLink, turning around and putting it right back on you?
8880920	8883240	What are you looking forward to this holiday season?
8883240	8884240	Too many games.
8884240	8885240	Too little time.
8885240	8888640	I have too many on my Steam account to still go through, and then I'm worried about what's
8888640	8892120	going to happen come this Christmas if Steam does something compared to last year.
8892120	8893120	Oh, they will.
8893120	8894120	Absolutely they will.
8894120	8899560	And, you know, it's funny because I have Metroid Other M. I haven't got the time since I moved
8899560	8900560	to set up my Wii.
8900560	8904120	I just recently set up my Wii, so I'm going to probably sit down this week and play it
8904120	8908840	for a little while to see how good it is, or see how much of a flop.
8908840	8911080	But it should be interesting, but I don't.
8911080	8913680	Anyone in the studio want to chime in on this, the game they're really looking forward to
8913680	8915680	this holiday?
8915680	8919520	I'm not really looking forward to a game, actually.
8919520	8922160	I want to save my money and go to Disneyland.
8922160	8923720	There you go.
8923720	8926480	A lot of other stuff that I wasn't- I want to play in Flynn's Arcade!
8926480	8927680	Oh, the Tron game!
8927680	8929080	I'm looking forward to the Tron game.
8929080	8930080	Yes, yes, yes, the Tron game.
8930080	8931580	The Tron game does look good.
8931580	8933080	It's Prince of Persia with Tron.
8933080	8936480	Are you very afraid of them dropping the ball on that also?
8936480	8941200	That's my biggest concern, is that it looks good, and you see pictures, you see the demos
8941200	8946360	and stuff, but then when it comes out, it'll be like, what on earth did they do to this?
8946360	8947360	Excellent.
8947360	8949400	Movie tie-in games are almost always terrible.
8949400	8952880	There are very few movie tie-in games that ever do very well.
8952880	8958520	GoldenEye is like the biggest exception to a rule in the history of ever.
8958520	8959520	Like you know what I mean?
8959520	8962040	But GoldenEye wasn't in the movie, though.
8962040	8964760	Well, it was later on, but it didn't come out beforehand.
8964760	8967520	No, no, that's why Pierce Brosnan was in it.
8967520	8972400	It was out there to support the movie, and the game was better than the movie.
8972400	8976480	I mean, that never happens, you know what I mean?
8976480	8983820	So I think Tron- I don't think Tron is going to be like the, oh my god, face melting-est
8983820	8988120	awesome game ever, but I think it will be cool, you know, just even based on what little
8988120	8989600	bit I played at E3.
8989600	8993480	I think if they can kind of bring something into the story and sort of bridge the gap
8993480	8996800	between the two movies, which is what the game is supposed to do, that'll be kind of
8996800	8997800	neat.
8997800	9001640	Yeah, hopefully they'll keep it as much to the movie as possible.
9001640	9007760	That's what I like to hopefully see in that and play, because I loved Tron growing up
9007760	9009120	as a kid, when I grew up as a kid.
9009120	9013160	I saw that and I was totally amazed by the way they did that, and I'm looking forward
9013160	9016360	for the new one when it comes out, so.
9016360	9021000	Giovedea in our chatroom brings up another Wii game that we're kind of neglecting here
9021000	9022000	for the holidays.
9022000	9023000	Epic Mickey.
9023000	9024560	Giovedea says, I want Epic Mickey.
9024560	9028840	I think that is going to be probably one of the biggest sellers on the Wii this holiday
9028840	9035700	season, because I think it does a good job of something for hardcore and casual players.
9035700	9039080	At least for the hardcore who haven't abandoned their Wiis altogether.
9039080	9043760	And I think at the same time it's a game that kids can play, and they'll be kind of excited
9043760	9044760	about it.
9044760	9049040	It's kind of like, this is going to sound weird, but it's kind of like Kingdom Hearts.
9049040	9053920	Like not the game itself, but just kind of the audience it's going to reach.
9053920	9057480	It's very Kingdom Hearts.
9057480	9059880	And I'm looking forward to the new Donkey Kong.
9059880	9065440	I really want to see how that lives up to the other ones, so that would be fun, so.
9065440	9066440	Alright.
9066440	9068680	Well buddy, we're going to let you go so we can go wrap up the show.
9068680	9070560	Thank you so much for your call, I appreciate it.
9070560	9071560	No problem.
9071560	9072560	I'm going to go fishing, see ya.
9072560	9074800	You'll be able to play a million games this holiday season.
9074800	9075800	Yeah, I don't know.
9075800	9076800	But you better still make great nights.
9076800	9079640	Between WoW and everything, I don't know how it's going to go, so.
9079640	9081000	Alright, have a good one buddy.
9081000	9082000	Yep, you too.
9082000	9086040	Alright, that's going to do it for calls tonight, thank you guys so much for trying to call.
9086040	9089520	For those of you who didn't get through, because we got slammed at the end there, I don't know,
9089520	9092000	it's so weird how it comes in phases like that.
9092000	9094600	Please send us an email, share your thoughts over email, we'd appreciate it.
9094600	9100000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, or what I like to call, Make Jamie Work.
9100000	9101000	Anyhow that's good.
9101000	9102000	What?
9102000	9103000	I love you.
9103000	9104000	I work plenty.
9104000	9105000	I know you do.
9105000	9106000	Alright.
9106000	9108000	You're working very hard on your Knights of the Magic Crystals.
9108000	9111920	I'm not playing it right now.
9111920	9112920	Right now?
9112920	9113920	Yeah, because it's all on cooldown.
9113920	9116420	Yeah, it's all on cooldown, she spent all her points for the hour.
9116420	9119160	If the chat room was working for me, I would be in there.
9119160	9122400	I am messing, slow your roll.
9122400	9123400	It's going to be okay.
9123400	9124400	What?
9124400	9126400	903 is when the band was lifted, I looked.
9126400	9127400	Just so you know.
9127400	9128400	What?
9128400	9129400	Oh, 903?
9129400	9130400	Yeah.
9130400	9133480	It's going to be interesting because we're about ready to end the show, and, uh, I-
9133480	9134480	No FUs tonight!
9134480	9137720	Yeah, that we can't do FUs or a cage match, we can't take votes in a cage match.
9137720	9138720	You can't do-
9138720	9140440	Well, 903 is only a few minutes away.
9140440	9143360	Yeah, well, can we stretch for 12 more minutes?
9143360	9144880	Do you have more last minute stories?
9144880	9148720	It's not really 12 minutes, it's, I guess it's 12 minutes.
9148720	9152840	We can indeed still do cage match, Rob, because you tally the votes.
9152840	9155440	And I can, I can add some extra windows to that, and it'll help you.
9155440	9157560	Oh, okay, I was like, I don't know how to do private messages on here.
9157560	9160320	Okay, if you know how to do it, then we can figure it out.
9160320	9163340	But I, I still should ask if there's any other last minute stories, because I didn't really
9163340	9165040	let Loki finish.
9165040	9166040	Uhhh...
9166040	9167040	No.
9167040	9170840	Well, I can talk about some other stuff, I guess.
9170840	9171840	Sure!
9171840	9172840	I suppose.
9172840	9173840	Um...
9173840	9180480	The PlayStation 3, there was supposed to be a new jailbreak device that got put out, but,
9180480	9182600	uh, it was supposed to be a downgrader.
9182600	9187000	Of course, right now it's kind of in limbo of whether or not that's actually legit or
9187000	9188000	not.
9188000	9189280	Um, most people think it's not.
9189280	9195360	Um, but of course, people have found ways around different protections, including getting
9195360	9200200	Black Ops to work, so it's kind of fine.
9200200	9203560	Um, and then, what else was I going to talk about?
9203560	9208280	Oh, yeah, Darksiders 2 got announced, and it's supposed to take place alongside, uh,
9208280	9209280	the original Darksiders series.
9209280	9213960	I guess they're going to have up to four games, because it's going to be one for each horseman
9213960	9214960	of the apocalypse.
9214960	9218640	Because they're saying that there's only one apocalypse, and it wouldn't make sense to
9218640	9221800	have a sequel to the game.
9221800	9223600	Final Fantasy always has an apocalypse.
9223600	9229000	Yeah, but that's Final Fantasy, and, you know, that's just very unrealistic.
9229000	9232600	Whereas Darksiders, you know, absolutely full of realism.
9232600	9235880	Aren't video games all supposed to be a little bit unrealistic, unless it's like, I don't
9235880	9236880	know, like a sports game?
9236880	9237880	I'm being sarcastic, bro.
9237880	9239360	Oh, oh, oh, my bad.
9239360	9242360	Yes, you just didn't seem to get it, did you?
9242360	9243360	Uh...
9243360	9244360	Story of my life.
9244360	9245360	Yeah.
9245360	9246360	Don't agree with that!
9246360	9251080	I think that was more of a dismissive yeah.
9251080	9255360	Um, other fun stuff that we can mention here, we'll just go through all the stories.
9255360	9258040	Um, Grand Theft Auto trilogy coming out on Macs.
9258040	9260080	Wow, that took them a long enough time.
9260080	9266040	What, I had Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on my old PC laptop that I got back in 05?
9266040	9270440	Yeah, that took some time there.
9270440	9274560	Glad to see that they're, uh, on the ball with that stuff.
9274560	9278360	And then, uh, apparently it was at Crazy Taxis coming out later this month.
9278360	9279360	That's kind of neat.
9279360	9280840	Let's make some crazy money!
9280840	9281840	On Xbox Live Arcade.
9281840	9286720	Of course it's not going to have all the, uh, wonderful, you know, product placement
9286720	9287720	in it.
9287720	9288720	Just have fun.
9288720	9289720	And all the music.
9289720	9291480	All the licensed music is not there anymore.
9291480	9292920	Oh, darn.
9292920	9293920	Um...
9293920	9294920	I love it.
9294920	9296560	AkumaJP in chat is like, what?
9296560	9299800	Final Fantasy is real!
9299800	9300960	Only at anime conventions.
9300960	9301960	Is it real?
9301960	9303200	And this is kind of neat.
9303200	9308080	The tabletop game Zombies apparently is coming to Xbox Live Arcade as well.
9308080	9312320	And I haven't actually played that tabletop game, but it looks like it might be fun.
9312320	9314160	America loves zombies.
9314160	9318560	It's also, I guess, uh, it might be coming to Windows 7 as well, or Windows Phone 7.
9318560	9321560	I love Plants vs. Zombies.
9321560	9325800	Apparently that'll be the first quarter of 2011, and, uh, I guess it was announced three
9325800	9326800	years ago.
9326800	9327800	Alright.
9327800	9328800	Wow.
9328800	9333080	Um, we still need to go around and give everybody's final thought, so I don't want you to keep
9333080	9334480	feeling like you have to buy time.
9334480	9337480	Is that all you want to mention, or are there any other stories that are killing you over
9337480	9338480	there?
9338480	9339480	Nope, that's it.
9339480	9340960	You know, we could always just watch the boobie video again.
9340960	9341960	I mean, that's all...
9341960	9342960	No, I'm kidding.
9342960	9346120	We're gonna go around and give everybody's final thought and wrap up for the night.
9346120	9348540	We might actually end at midnight Eastern tonight.
9348540	9349860	What a change of pace.
9349860	9352520	The East Coast listeners will be getting embedded at a decent hour.
9352520	9353520	Thanks, you guys.
9353520	9356360	Uh, anyhow, let's go around and give everybody's final thoughts and try to wrap up the show
9356360	9359440	tonight and, you know, say thanks for listening and all that.
9359440	9360760	Salacious pulp!
9360760	9363000	Thank you so much for being here, as always.
9363000	9366880	And, uh, do you have any final thoughts tonight for our listeners?
9366880	9368320	No.
9368320	9372920	He's a man of many words tonight.
9372920	9376240	All right, uh, Loki, do you have any final thoughts tonight?
9376240	9377800	Um, not really.
9377800	9381480	I'm just gonna try to play more stuff this week and get some more sleep and...
9381480	9383400	I don't know.
9383400	9385160	That's all I can do.
9385160	9389520	My final thought is I'm really gonna try to avoid getting pink eye again, because it sucks.
9389520	9392160	Darzaka, your final thought?
9392160	9395240	I'm still getting used to the stuff on my face.
9395240	9396240	Your hair?
9396240	9397240	My hair.
9397240	9398240	My hair's cute.
9398240	9399240	I have bangs now.
9399240	9400240	I like your hair.
9400240	9401240	It's cute.
9401240	9404120	All right, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9404120	9406880	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and supporting us.
9406880	9408040	We really appreciate it.
9408040	9411200	Hey, if you like what you heard tonight, please tell people about our show.
9411200	9412720	Tell two people about our show.
9412720	9414060	Help us spread the word.
9414060	9416320	Kind reviews on iTunes are always helpful as well.
9416320	9419520	You know, just anything you can do because, you know, we don't have advertising.
9419520	9421720	We're not running advertising on the show, you notice, too.
9421720	9425240	Uh, it's really the only way we can help spread word of mouth.
9425240	9428480	And stop asking about me fixing the PSP site.
9428480	9433200	It literally, I get, like, ten minutes a week to myself to work on stuff, so.
9433200	9434800	I'd do it if I knew how, but I don't.
9434800	9437920	Uh, I will need to talk to you about getting the FTP code.
9437920	9440760	It's been so long since I've actually gone and done anything.
9440760	9441760	That I can do.
9441760	9442760	Yeah, we can work that out.
9442760	9446120	All right, that's gonna do it anyway, so Loki's aware, folks.
9446120	9447120	He'll try what he can.
9447120	9448640	Uh, but yeah, that's it.
9448640	9449640	We're done.
9449640	9450880	Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
9450880	9451880	We'll see you next week.
9451880	9453640	We'll do this all over again, episode 390.
9453640	9454640	Oof.
9454640	9456640	We're almost to 400.
9456640	9457640	We'll see you next week, guys!
