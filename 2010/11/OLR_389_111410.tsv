13903	25659	Tonight, November 14th, 2010, the creators of Rock Band are up for sale, a popular DS title finally gets localized for Japan, and did the indie games movement backlash cause change at Microsoft?
31601	36504	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36544	39146	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
39586	48932	Walking you through gaming chat over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and with me as always my awesome co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49112	50012	I'm upset with you, Rob.
50593	51113	Why now?
51473	52414	Because of this game.
52834	56315	Ooh, you're playing Knights of the Old Sorority, as we talked about last week.
56395	59417	Knights of the Vampire Mafia War thing.
60157	60777	I blame you.
61197	62038	Well, it is my fault.
62058	63938	We'll talk about stupid clicky games in a minute.
64299	69020	But we have to say hello, of course, to the one and only Techmaster eBay-lovin', Loki!
69841	70161	Hey.
70677	71277	How are you doing, Loki?
71457	72077	I'm doing fine.
72317	72557	All right.
72577	73958	What are you shopping for on eBay now?
73978	74798	I'm not shopping for anything.
74818	75838	I was just looking at something.
75858	78359	I was just curious to see how much it went for.
78699	81679	Do you do this at home, too, shopping on eBay all the time, or does the wife get pissed?
81799	83320	I don't actually shop on eBay all the time.
83600	84640	All right.
85000	88821	I was going to pick up something later on, but not for a while.
89461	91962	They have this XCM V-Box 2.
92222	93082	It allows you to play...
95262	123253	Xbox games and stuff like that pretty much anything that has a component in or component out on your PC without lags so like for example the other day when I was shuffling to get it to work correctly I remember the DJ Hero 2 I would have been able to play it just fine so I might pick that up because it will be handy for different things but yeah that and my rather be playing Grand Theft Auto license plate frame that I probably should get for my car because that would be funny
124508	131247	Alright, by the way, I went over to Loki's house to play some Kinect the other night and that was good times.
132410	132551	Yep.
133749	136850	Shaking the butt in front of the camera that takes the pictures over and over again.
137050	140531	My room is really small to play.
141411	142912	So is my apartment, so it's all good.
143112	148093	I'm thinking of mounting the TV to the wall just for multiple reasons because the cat also likes to use the scratching post.
148353	148593	There you go.
148613	151314	Pretty soon you're going to have the baby running around, so it might not be a bad idea.
152314	155835	You've got at least nine months to go, but you know.
156485	157526	I'm not worried about that.
157546	167391	I think, though, mounting it to the wall would give me an extra foot or two to be able to, you know, so I won't have to be up against the couch to actually play, you know, Connected Adventures.
168412	169633	It's dumb, that requirement.
169893	181740	By the way, finally, because it's just, I hardly ever get to Loki's house anymore, I don't know why, but I finally got to meet the baby, and I got to see the nursery that is all internet famous, like, you know, the pictures were on, what, GameStops magazine thingy, right?
181760	181900	Yeah.
182621	183782	They found him through Flickr or whatever.
183802	187145	I was going to take some video for you guys, but the baby was going to bed.
187185	187786	It wasn't a good time.
188166	190708	But maybe one of these days I'll get the video.
190728	192230	I can take video too, I guess.
192330	194031	I do have a video camera.
194152	195513	It's a nice setup.
195573	197214	You should kind of show off a little more.
197295	199477	It's very gamer nerdy.
199917	202640	Let's just hope the baby does not grow up to resent video games.
203080	203981	That would be a tragedy.
205402	210885	By the way, speaking of nerdy stuff, I saw the best license plate in the world today.
211125	211505	You ready?
211905	212405	Ready, nerds?
212806	214526	It was LoadStar81.
214546	214987	Nice.
218723	218863	Allen
239492	240152	Salacious Pulp
257881	259583	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
282950	286352	Should I tell my story about Chocobo Farm Town or whatever that is now or later?
286412	286953	Go ahead.
287793	293798	So I started playing that game because they have a banner under the whole Knights of the Old Crystal Sorority War game on Facebook.
294118	296479	I started playing the Chocobo Tower, and it's actually kind of cute.
297360	303244	There's some things about it, but there's a lot to it, and a lot of it's just kind of WTF.
303724	306166	And Alan walks in while I'm trying to play this earlier.
306186	307007	He's like, what are you doing?
307047	308107	I'm like, I'm trying to...
308928	312749	I'm trying to play this game, and I'm trying to breed my chocobo with Jamie's chocobo.
312789	316250	Like, I went to her farm to try and sex her chocobo while she's not online to defend it.
316871	319671	And Alan's like, well, wait, your chocobo's just a baby.
319731	320392	You can't do that.
320432	321932	I'm like, I just fed it a growth cake.
321972	323373	And then I'm like, what is this?
323553	325113	Is this what my life has become?
325613	328694	I'm talking about breeding chocobos like it's real life?
329274	331715	Is this the future of video games?
331755	334316	All defensive that you aged it with the magical cake.
334656	336177	You're like, I gave it the cake.
336197	337117	What are you talking about?
337677	338317	Look at your life.
338357	339178	Look at your choices.
341338	343579	Like, I hear you judging me, but I gave it cake.
344399	351342	It looks, what I saw of it, it just looked like a sort of more detailed web sort of Digipet Tamagotchi type thing.
351742	354843	Because you have to brush it when it gets dirty, so you click on the little bird.
354863	357704	It's like Pet Society, only they go and battle each other.
357904	360485	It's ridiculous stupid, yet I'm playing it anyway.
360645	361845	They go off for hot chicken love.
362085	364586	And I totally sexed Jamie's chicken when she wasn't looking.
367222	370404	and I snuck into Ranch last night and put feathers in the Chocobo's hair.
370905	373827	I'm going to go take them because then I'll get extra luck for them.
374987	375207	Nice.
376328	377369	You punked out my Chocobo.
377729	378750	You pimped my Chocobo.
379510	379851	That's it.
379951	381051	It's called Pimp My Chocobo.
381292	386575	You know, this is not any better than playing, say, Farmville, so I am going to look at you in shame.
386595	387516	No, because it's Square Enix.
387576	388596	No, I'm sorry.
388616	389037	Hold on.
389137	397002	The artwork in the Knights of the Crystal Republic Vampire Wars is by the same guy who did Tactics artwork.
398123	399704	And it's not Farmville.
400304	400664	Oh, okay.
400744	402605	Well, I must be completely wrong then.
402625	403326	Yes, you are.
404686	405167	Except I'm not.
405187	407188	Because that's never happened in the course of this show.
407208	407768	I'm never wrong.
407788	409849	DarkSakura, are there any other video games you'd like to talk about?
409869	410089	Yes.
410770	416713	I played a bunch of the Avatar game that got left at my house, what, three months ago?
417974	418955	So you're finally getting around to it?
419575	420015	I like it.
420055	423017	So being an Avi in Second Life didn't work out for you, so now you get to...
423519	425960	I got tired of those people.
426921	436306	But I really liked the game except that your Ikran, the banshee thing, I parked it so I could go get some stuff out of these flowers.
436647	437747	I came back and it was dead.
438368	439168	It got shot up.
439228	440629	It was laying dead in the water.
440649	442970	And I'm like, now where am I going to get another one?
444591	446252	So I was like, well, crap.
447233	451015	Did you have an emotional breakdown like the characters in the movie when they're, you know,
451317	452257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
474205	481007	In fact, it was like when the character first hops around in her avatar body and walks around, she goes up to the human people and goes, You're so tiny!
481247	481908	It's cute!
482708	483968	And we squishy tiny little heads!
484508	485569	I picked a female character.
485789	491871	I need to introduce the ever-present fourth guest on our show, even though technically Salacious Pulp is the fourth guest tonight.
491911	500874	We have our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and you can join us in chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
502074	502475	Let's see.
502775	506877	Jim Sally in our chatroom says, Japan's working on genetically creating chocobos right now.
507357	507677	Could be.
508058	509298	They need to talk to the KFC people.
509678	511900	Frisbee says, Navi or Navi?
512360	512800	Hello!
513300	513660	Hey!
514161	514781	Watch out!
515161	515581	Listen!
516842	517202	Hey!
518043	518763	DarkSakura!
519183	519584	Listen!
521985	522305	Hey!
523426	524626	Don't make me smite you.
527288	529689	Dan got Call of Booty Black Ops.
532031	533552	Now that's a game I'd play.
533572	536394	No, it's Call of Duty.
536894	540377	And speaking of Avatar, because it has a dude as the main guy's voice.
540657	540977	Oh, really?
541157	541597	Yeah.
541778	544379	Did you hear, though, that you can play the full game of Zork in there?
544399	545160	Yes, you can.
545420	552164	I was listening to Bobby tonight on the car ride over, and yes, he was talking about it on his show, and I was like, that's actually really cool.
552225	554366	Like, Call of Duty, not my genre of game.
554646	555747	Not disrespecting the game.
555787	557288	I realize a lot of people play those games.
557508	557808	I don't.
558449	559309	And the minigame.
559389	560090	But I think that's cool.
560470	561791	That plays a lot like Smash TV.
565719	567020	Dan was like all over that.
567060	569082	And then he's like, oh, it's like Smash TV.
569102	571003	And his friend had never played Smash TV.
571043	572064	So Dan's like, we're turning this off.
572084	572925	We're playing Smash TV.
573885	574686	Call of Booty.
575406	576627	They need to make that porn.
576767	577608	I know, totally.
577648	579549	It would not be as great as the porn.
579830	580750	Oh, porn tangent.
580951	581551	Sound the alarm.
581651	584193	Okay, so we're at Loki's house, right?
584413	590838	And Loki has tons... Just so you all know, Loki and the Mrs. have tons and tons and tons of pornography stored on their Xbox.
591238	612044	But it's not like real It's actually on my PC, but we stream it Whatever, it's not real porn It's all like funny porn And we watched a porno called Not the Cosby's No, there's lots of real porn on there too, but we watched funny porn We watched funny ones, okay That's just inappropriate, you don't just whip out normal porn Oh, okay, sorry Having a dinner party, hey, look at, wow I'm such a 12 year old I know you are
612344	626533	All right, if you want to see her 12-year-old antics during her tarot, we were watching Not the Cosbys 2, which were all these Cosby family lookalikes, and they were having sex, but not really with each other.
627414	633518	But the weird thing about it to me was that there was 15 minutes of setup and parody to the plot.
634399	637501	It's probably the longest intro I've ever seen where it was actually just dialogue.
637521	638842	I like how my gaming has turned to porn.
638862	639182	Yeah.
639901	641944	I just want to say it was also very disturbing that there was a Rudy.
642085	644468	There is already a Call of Booty, actually.
644508	645089	Is there really?
645109	647613	It is Call of Booty, Modern Horrorfare.
648535	650077	Of course, Modern Horrorfare.
650458	650939	My bad.
651119	651500	Ah, yes.
651660	651720	Ah!
655764	681712	God bless the porn industry Amen Speaking of video games and porn and we covered this on Comic Insanity this morning because it was WTF News Some guy on RPG Maker 3000 made Marvel Brothel where Professor X decides that instead of bridging the gap between humans and mutants instead of sending out his heroines to go help people he's going to pimp them out
682212	683493	I had a story coming up on that later.
683894	684194	You did?
684775	685715	That's alright.
685755	686196	Nobody cared.
686376	686696	It's alright.
688077	688678	I didn't know.
688698	689799	Here's the deal, guys.
690079	694363	When I report it as news later on in the second half of the show, I want you all to act surprised.
694503	695864	Like you've never heard about this before.
695924	697686	This is totally new information.
698767	699287	I'm sorry.
699347	699848	No, it's okay.
700428	706574	Everybody just make me feel important and when I talk about this in the second half, I want you all to pretend you've never heard about this before.
706674	707274	Anyway, continue.
707294	708636	Pretend Rob's covered in angry tics.
710379	711261	Oh wow, Rob!
712423	713686	You're buzzing!
716863	722408	The guy that they have playing Bill Cosby is just a ringer for Bill Cosby.
722768	725730	He's a comedian though, so he doesn't actually do any of the porn in there.
725790	727671	He takes the high road, I guess.
729413	732535	But seriously though, the guy looks and sounds like Bill Cosby.
732555	733035	It's just weird.
733135	734016	It's kind of scary.
735797	740501	I was really disturbed by the fact there was a Rudy, but at least I didn't see her naked, even though I'm sure she was 18.
740941	741822	I mean, that would just be wrong.
743183	744823	I think Denise was the only one I saw.
745584	747405	Who went off to college in a different world?
747425	748025	Okay, that was Denise.
748065	750706	Denise got banged in one of the scenes and that's the one we watched.
751487	753768	I was like, okay, yeah, alright, turn it off.
754928	759251	And then we watched Harry Potter, God of Little Fire with Netflix with Riff Trax.
760510	761111	That has to be funny.
761151	762892	I watched part of Avatar with Riff Trax.
763532	764133	That was pretty funny.
767135	768276	I know I played other stuff.
770298	773540	I played Robot Unicorn Attack in the middle of Starbucks again, which was pretty fun.
774881	775041	And...
777665	779968	Yeah, that's Carl of Duty.
780228	781890	Yeah, Tigerclaw linked me to this.
782190	782751	Carl of Duty.
782771	783091	I've seen that.
783251	786355	It's Black Cops, and it's Carl from Family Matters.
786835	788237	And it's very badly photoshopped.
788337	796526	Which, funny enough, when we were watching this Not the Cosby's thing, I said, when are they going to do the one with Family Matters, but they will actually have the daughter from Family Matters?
797321	798081	Oh, she's doing porn?
798121	799222	Yeah, the middle one.
799842	803923	That'd be tough because they could have also done the same thing with Saved by the Bell, but they didn't.
804023	806424	Instead, they chose to have really funny wigs on them.
808124	810405	I totally saw something that made me think of you.
811285	812845	The Showgirls Anniversary Edition.
813166	813546	I bought it.
814966	816366	Damn it, now I can't buy it for you.
816566	817047	I'm sorry.
817207	817947	Which anniversary?
818507	822774	Blu-ray, whatever 15th, I think Is it sad that I know that?
823695	827902	Yes, it is Anyhow, video games Yes, your gaming week Anything else that you want to talk about?
830617	831558	Loki, how was your gaming week?
831798	832539	I didn't play a whole lot.
833279	836782	Mainly just Grand Theft Auto and then the Kinect stuff.
836842	839664	I played a little bit of Dance Central because it was odd.
840244	846329	My living room was big enough to play Kinect Adventures at one time but somehow I guess it shrunk.
847109	850111	Or maybe I didn't calibrate my system again since I switched TVs.
850612	858758	But for whatever reason I couldn't play Kinect Adventures because it kept saying that I was too close to the camera even though I was several feet away.
859318	860419	I know how to do that dance
883783	884143	Well, good.
884223	887905	Then you could finish that part of the song, but this is the rest of it.
888206	896531	Oh, and everybody had fun laughing at me because I had to do the, like, I don't know, they called it the poison where you're like, I don't know.
896811	897471	It's hard to describe.
900458	901079	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
916995	921820	God forbid they make it simple to move your profile back and forth between two systems.
922261	924784	Oh no, you have to recover it between systems.
924804	926185	That is a little ridiculous.
926245	929029	I mean, it should be as easy as putting in your username and password.
929089	934415	And they'll make it so easy to go to friends' houses and do the rock band thing or whatever.
934435	934775	Exactly.
934875	934935	Or...
936597	938539	or, um, a memory card.
938859	942761	You know, because that works with a memory card if you play offline.
942882	946584	But as soon as you connect it to live, oh, I'm sorry, this is not meant for this system.
946604	947865	You need to recover your profile.
948065	948285	Yuck.
948706	950667	And your profile is not that big.
950707	952448	I mean, it's a few megs at the most.
952948	955951	But it takes, like, a goddamn half hour to download.
956011	957612	It takes forever to go through this stuff.
957652	957812	Well...
958172	961194	I don't know about a half hour because Alan and I kind of have to do that a lot.
961214	961875	It took me 10 minutes.
961895	963896	And I have a really fast internet connection.
964236	965497	Weird.
965517	967439	It doesn't matter how fast your connection is.
967499	971802	It just takes forever to download a stupid 10 meg file or whatever.
972882	974724	It's very inconvenient.
974764	976485	That's why I haven't really done that yet.
976745	980608	I just need to get rid of my other system and then go from there.
984005	987267	Other than stuff on there, I played some iOS games.
987367	989389	I just played a little bit of Rock Band.
989489	990089	That's kind of fun.
991070	995373	It kind of makes me wish they had an O2 Jam game or something like that.
996394	1000537	Or DJ Max or something like that on the iPhone or iPod.
1000557	1001217	That'd be kind of cool.
1005860	1006441	That's pretty much it.
1007453	1013195	I'll get in my gaming week and I'll let Alan have a shot, although I know he watched me play a lot of this stuff, so maybe he'll want to chime in, I don't know.
1013516	1018538	But I was playing a little bit of Dance Masters, which Loki was kind enough to loan me, and I thought I brought, didn't I put it in the car?
1018558	1019358	I was going to bring it back to him?
1019638	1019918	I don't know.
1020318	1021439	Yeah, you grabbed something.
1021599	1022679	I had no big deal if you didn't.
1022779	1026901	I played a little bit of Dance Masters, which is, it's okay.
1027241	1030703	You know, again, I like the look of it a little better than Dance Masters.
1030723	1031783	I do really like the look of the game.
1031983	1034545	Night of Fire Did You Unlock Any Songs?
1057063	1058204	A few, I haven't done a ton.
1058224	1066789	Because I've seen the full track list, and yeah, it's a lot of DDR stuff, but I was just surprised to see Afronova Primeval on there.
1067490	1069191	Why has it always got to be Primeval?
1069291	1071873	I mean, seriously, why can't you just put the regular Afronova?
1071933	1073053	I mean, I don't understand.
1074034	1075575	But the exotic ethnic dance is funny.
1075955	1082019	Well, I know, though, that a lot of the dances that were in there, you're saying, are Lukpara-influenced, they're Tekpara-influenced.
1083451	1091596	Well, I know the exotic ethnic one, if you've ever heard that song, is a very Egyptian-sounding song, and you do all these little walk-like and Egyptian moves that are really stupid.
1092076	1095759	But Loki hit the nail on the head when he talked about this game last week.
1096099	1097660	How are you supposed to learn these dances?
1097720	1100262	There's no break-it-down type of mode or anything.
1100662	1105745	I mean, unlike Dance Central, easy, medium, and hard are all the same dance.
1106005	1108227	It's just that you have more you have to hit.
1108787	1135714	so I think that's how it wants you to learn it is that you have to do the silhouettes and easy and then you have to add some of the circles and medium and then so I think that's how you learn I'm not sure if it's as effective as Dance Central was just watching you play some of those Dance Master songs I didn't know how you were doing it and I know that you were playing them on Expert but I was I mean I could see you mimicking what was on the screen but it was so fast I was like how are you doing this like I didn't understand you just memorize it you memorize dance
1135914	1138637	It's just the silhouettes is all that you're really mimicking.
1138957	1141220	It's basically learn to para para really quickly.
1141992	1146833	Actdeft in our chatroom says Primeval is from Dance Maniacs slash Freaks, which is Parapara-esque.
1147274	1148834	I doubt it would be the same dance, though.
1148974	1150975	I mean, you gotta see what some of these things look like.
1151595	1154616	The whole wax on, wax off dancing wouldn't work.
1154636	1156676	There's lots of Sailor Moon sort of salutes.
1156996	1157496	Yeah, there are.
1157616	1159777	There's a lot of cute, chibi things in the game.
1160037	1170420	I mean, and here's the other thing, and I know they've said numerous times, oh, this time around we're gonna really support download content.
1171107	1171908	Don't see anything yet.
1196747	1200132	I wanted to try that one, but... You actually get to go choo-choo a lot in it.
1200152	1200572	Awesome!
1200592	1201734	Yes, you go choo-choo.
1202355	1204878	And I think Alan was practically pointing and laughing the whole time.
1204918	1205619	It was pretty funny.
1205919	1206880	But yeah, he didn't play.
1208763	1211226	A new Kinect game I tried this week was Kinect Joyride.
1212428	1214270	I played the demo a little bit.
1214290	1214971	Why are you laughing?
1216863	1217824	The color of your car.
1219465	1223667	Okay, you saw the color of your car thing.
1224148	1224808	That was dumb.
1225589	1227550	It was the most fun I had playing the game.
1227690	1227970	Really?
1229351	1230492	Maybe I don't want to share why.
1230532	1233554	Maybe Alan will, but I'm not sharing why it was the most fun part of the game.
1234775	1236756	Well, if it's anything like what we did, then yes.
1240218	1243861	And it required my wife standing on the couch, but that's another story.
1245522	1248904	No, it's seriously, it's all pick a color.
1248924	1250586	I'm like, I just want to pick red.
1251166	1253168	I don't want to have to find something red in my house.
1253448	1256190	I just want to pick red or pick green.
1256810	1258471	It's all, no, pick something on the camera.
1258791	1262872	And you've seen, like, you know, webcams and how they get very pixelated and the color's kind of off.
1263152	1270434	Everything ends up being like a palish white or pink or, like, purple, no matter whatever the color is.
1270634	1272154	I definitely got a pale pink color.
1276448	1278029	Oh, so you went for Ass Pink?
1278829	1281631	Something like that, yeah.
1282191	1283972	Anyhow, so there was that.
1285332	1286953	But then it went black for a second.
1286993	1289014	I just realized it captured my asshole.
1289615	1289915	Anyway...
1292916	1293236	Kidding.
1294056	1294577	Except I'm not.
1295117	1295397	Let's see.
1295437	1299619	So yeah, I played Joyride and it was dopey.
1299739	1300599	I didn't like it at all.
1301119	1303600	I thought Mario Kart controlled better on the Wii.
1303920	1310363	Watching you play it, it looked like it had a pretty steep learning curve because when it looked at first couple minutes, you were sort of all over the place.
1310423	1313064	And I was like, this game looks like it controls horribly.
1313104	1314464	And you said that it kind of did.
1314904	1317845	But by the third or fourth lap, you were reading a lot better.
1317946	1318966	So I just think it has a...
1319666	1321848	It might have a little learning curve to it.
1321908	1322489	I don't know.
1324170	1332437	Granted, I only played the demo and I shouldn't base an impression of the game off the demo, but the demo did not leave me wanting to get the full game.
1333117	1333778	I got the full game.
1334118	1334458	Did you?
1334819	1335939	Did you like it better than the demo?
1335960	1337120	I actually haven't played the full game yet.
1337401	1338842	I also haven't played Kinect Sports yet.
1338882	1340783	That's the other game that I got, but I haven't played that yet.
1341204	1344546	I'm worried that it's going to say, well, sorry, your living room is too small.
1344987	1345167	Again.
1347124	1348525	Um, let's see, what else did I play this week?
1349226	1355631	Um, I was most, I mean, otherwise the same old stuff, Warcraft, Rock Band 3, I've been playing more of that.
1355871	1358173	I want to try the Your Shape Fitness demo.
1358853	1360474	Is there a demo on the Adventures disc?
1360795	1360955	Yeah.
1361215	1361915	Oh, I'll have to try it.
1361935	1369341	If you put the disc in and go to your, um, you know, you can either go in there and play the demo, or you can just do it through your actual demo channel thing.
1369361	1370862	Okay.
1372084	1374668	So yeah, other than the dance games and that, that was pretty much it.
1374688	1377733	Not a lot of new stuff this week, so maybe next week.
1377993	1378714	That was the one big game.
1378874	1382861	Otherwise, I've been playing the stuff I have, which is novel for me.
1383962	1385525	Alan, anything you want to add for your gaming week?
1386721	1391766	Just World of Warcraft More and more, what's going on in your WoW worlds these days?
1392006	1411444	I've sort of set up these goals for myself to accomplish by the time Cataclysm comes out And they're not necessarily things that are going away when Cataclysm comes out It's just stuff to keep me busy, occupied for the last four weeks But yeah, I'm trying to get 100 mounts to get that reward
1412725	1413685	Good time.
1413705	1418548	Because once it comes out, I'm going to be looking at all the new content and I'm not going to be able to grind all that stupid stuff.
1418648	1419808	So that's what I'm doing now.
1420249	1423390	Is there anything this holiday season that you're looking forward to besides Cataclysm?
1425491	1430014	I haven't really been following the releases because I usually buy that stuff for myself.
1430574	1430974	Gotcha.
1431034	1432415	I'm not following it really.
1432435	1434236	All right.
1434296	1438718	Well, maybe you can find good deals on last year's holiday releases or just watch Steam because that's...
1439682	1446006	Oh yeah, Steam I'm sure is going to have, you know, 8 games for 10 cents or whatever their Christmas sale is.
1446086	1448007	And I'll be like, sure, I'll pick up some stuff.
1448308	1448828	Exactly.
1449648	1454752	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's gaming news.
1455772	1457393	Not a whole lot of housekeeping tonight.
1457634	1460816	I will just say, please join our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
1461136	1464538	Or of course you can follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
1465439	1467220	Otherwise, I don't think I have a whole lot to report tonight.
1468821	1481355	There's the spin-off shows that DarkSakura and myself have DarkSakura hosts a show called Comic Insanity Just drop the I and you can find them on iTunes and Infamous.net
1481837	1482197	That's right.
1482757	1486739	And the official first episode of the new podcast I'm doing with Extifer.
1487079	1491160	If you like Warcraft talk, I would let Alan go on forever, but there's a whole new show for that now.
1491220	1492260	It's Horde House.
1492840	1494061	The best little Horde House in Azeroth.
1494101	1494901	It's not on iTunes yet.
1494921	1495621	We're trying to get it there.
1496262	1497422	But more information is available.
1497462	1498342	There's a link on our Twitter.
1498682	1499723	We have a Twitter over there too.
1500123	1501643	Twitter.com slash Horde House.
1502323	1503744	So that's our spinoff projects.
1504244	1505145	Probably won't end there.
1505445	1507166	Maybe Loki will get a side project soon enough.
1507206	1508708	Who knows what else is going to happen.
1508728	1510929	Yeah, when am I going to have time for a side project?
1510949	1511450	Seriously.
1511570	1512351	Raising a baby, 101.
1512851	1513151	All right.
1514312	1516274	Let's move on with some gaming news.
1516434	1517995	Loki, there's always time for gaming news, at least.
1518175	1518716	Yes, there is.
1519856	1524921	Of course, the news came out this week that Harmonix is being sold by Viacom.
1525381	1527643	The question in everybody's mind is, to whom?
1528724	1551705	um of course you know EA sounds like a likely candidate because for one they've been publishing their games lately and two they seem to like snap up um you know popular developers I mean they did the same thing with Valve and with um a bunch of other ones I mean they have literally a slew of development houses working on games for them
1552325	1554687	So, it seems like it might be likely.
1554767	1558809	Other things that people have thrown out there that might be interesting possible candidates.
1559250	1562192	Microsoft, which would be really interesting if that happened.
1562952	1566815	Because then they would have basically Rock Band 2 themselves.
1567235	1569476	Which would be very strange.
1570317	1572939	And then possibly Activision.
1573379	1574860	But God, I hope that doesn't happen.
1576501	1578102	A lot of people in our chatroom yelling out Konami.
1578122	1578202	Okay.
1579065	1579765	Pro Evolution Soccer
1591519	1592539	That's basically it.
1592679	1597181	I mean, you know, there are other titles, you know, top titles that they have coming out.
1597642	1598682	Yeah, they have a DDR game.
1599782	1603704	By the way, I think Dance Dance Revolution came out this week on PlayStation 3 and Wii.
1604544	1605625	Oh, congrats, I guess.
1606505	1606745	Yeah.
1608206	1609226	That made a big splash.
1610547	1610787	Really?
1612327	1613668	You know, Dance Masters.
1614308	1616549	But those aren't really going to make them a ton of money.
1616929	1617990	Tiger Claw's throwing out Ubisoft.
1618010	1618370	Ubisoft.
1621093	1622594	I don't know if Ubisoft would do that.
1622854	1624436	I mean, they have their own music stuff.
1624796	1627219	And I don't know if they're big enough to where they'd be purchasing this stuff.
1627619	1630001	If anything, it's probably going to be EA.
1630021	1631043	X-Link says Atlas.
1631123	1631663	Come on, guys.
1631703	1633625	Now you're just reaching.
1633665	1635207	That's just retarded.
1635887	1636548	Squeenix.
1637309	1638450	Squeenix Eidos Harmonix.
1638890	1640732	Final Fantasy Dance Master or whatever.
1640832	1641393	Oh, my gosh.
1642808	1646171	So, other things you may be concerned because they're being sold and stuff.
1646531	1650114	What's that mean about the download content that's going to be coming out for these games?
1650455	1653357	Well, apparently it's not going to interrupt the download content that's going on.
1653698	1657021	They've already been working on stuff and that's not going to be affected by the sale at all.
1658262	1660544	They work on that stuff like four months out.
1660824	1663066	So, they're set through the holidays at least.
1663462	1666685	Yeah, so nothing's really going anywhere there.
1667285	1676113	And then, of course, also, if you are interested in purchasing some new download content for Rock Band 2, you may not be able to do that anymore.
1676133	1681758	In fact, actually, all Rock Band tracks, both DLC and...
1684082	1690407	I guess just the DLC is actually going to be incompatible with Rock Band 1 and 2.
1691108	1695071	It says apparently the Rock Band Network tracks will be compatible with all versions.
1695171	1699634	So at least you have an avenue for that stuff until they update the software for that.
1701175	1703177	So you will need to upgrade to Rock Band 3.
1703237	1703617	DarkSakura.com
1729342	1736807	It's going to cost you $2 to pay for the new Rock Band 3 version of the songs if you'd like to have keyboard and harmony upgrades.
1737247	1745633	If you want pro guitar bass versions of those songs, you're going to need to buy or need to purchase the pro upgrade, which will be for another dollar.
1745973	1749456	So $3 for an upgrade for these songs.
1751237	1753038	And that's each song, by the way.
1753058	1758962	So yeah, it's very interesting stuff.
1759733	1761935	Sorry, I got distracted because I got an email.
1762015	1770281	I'm not allowed to say it because it's under non-disclosure agreement, but I just got into a beta I've been waiting to get into for months and months and months and months, so I'm like... Sorry.
1771102	1771543	Invite, please.
1771723	1777727	If I'm shaking it, I'll try, but it's under NDA, so I can't say anything more about it, but I'm shaking and crying over here.
1778528	1779089	My bad.
1779129	1780530	Sorry, I know everybody hates that.
1780710	1783772	I know something you don't know, guy, but that's why I'm distracted.
1783812	1784973	I'm just telling you all I have an excuse.
1785934	1786775	I have a very good excuse.
1786795	1788176	Is it for Naughty Bear 2?
1788216	1788256	No.
1788776	1815701	yes it's for Naughty Bear 2 okay now they're gonna boot me I'm so so sad it's for Final Fantasy 14 oh wait I'm sorry that's just a regular subscription that's just called buying the PC version I like how they this one didn't make their show role or whatever but I like how they came out and said yeah we understand that the game's terrible we're working on it though it's like that doesn't excuse the fact they put the game out and it's terrible
1818225	1822867	So I wanted to say also about the developer situation and Harmonix getting sold and all that stuff.
1822987	1824708	I don't think this is quite the end of the world.
1824748	1826088	I think some people are making it out to be.
1826549	1829430	Harmonix is still... I mean, they're very well respected in the industry.
1829790	1830850	They do a lot of great stuff.
1831070	1838793	I do think losing the relationship with MTV Games is going to be a bummer for them because I think that's part of what's pushed that Rock Band DLC to the next level.
1838813	1839374	But let's face it.
1839794	1842215	Rock Band DLC has always been like...
1843595	1847238	And it's a household name now.
1847258	1853242	I don't really think that people need to convince, you know, they don't need the MTV backing to convince bands to be in Rock Band.
1853302	1853542	Yeah.
1853842	1865871	I mean, they have plenty of history and plenty of, you know, data to show them, hey, look, see, DLC on this, you know, sells and you'll make some money or, you know, it's worthwhile.
1865891	1866191	Mm-hmm.
1867768	1871731	Yeah, so I don't think it's the end of the world for them.
1871891	1881137	I don't know if we'll hear much through this holiday season, but I don't know if we'll hear about a change of hands just before Christmas, but I think probably in the new year.
1881337	1884479	But I wouldn't say doom and gloom for the Rock Band franchise yet.
1884579	1886281	I think it'll still sell well through the holidays too.
1886301	1889022	I can't believe people are already saying this game is a sales failure.
1889042	1893345	People have been saying before these games even came out, they've been saying music games are over.
1893365	1893806	Yeah.
1894861	1896302	Music games will never be over.
1896482	1897283	People are dumb.
1897543	1900626	They're like, well I can't take another plastic instrument.
1901126	1905490	You don't have to fucking buy another plastic instrument for every goddamn game that comes out.
1905850	1908852	Why are you buying multiple plastic instruments for these things?
1909573	1914657	Music games might not be the next big fad anymore, but music games are a long way from going out.
1915478	1916639	We'll always have Glee.
1918918	1919559	Thanks for watching!
1937040	1942023	I mean, sure, people get jaded about the fact that, you know, oh, they're just out for money.
1942703	1947005	And, you know, Green Day Rock Band kind of seemed like, oh, they're out for money.
1947686	1952088	You know, instead of saying, oh, it's the Green Day Rock Band track pack or something like that.
1952908	1962230	They used to do trackpacks where they put stuff out and there'd be some download content you could play before it hits service or whatever.
1963090	1969732	Or you could play these games standalone by themselves and it's like $20 for a game versus full price.
1970332	1975093	Ranma in our chatroom is asking, Loki, question, do you think that the music games are declining?
1976704	1977584	are they declining?
1978525	2000733	I don't think so I think Rock Band 3 sorry I'm cutting you off and interjecting my own answer but whatever Rock Band 3 is definitely a step above Rock Band 2 and it's a worthy upgrade DJ Hero 2 is a worthy step above DJ Hero 1 I think maybe there might be room to do something more original but at the same time don't put another plastic instrument in my house
2002113	2009921	Yeah, and that being said also, though, you know, Rock Band 3 did introduce the keyboards, which I don't see that as a bad thing.
2009981	2015446	It's not like we're, you know, first off, it's not required that you have a keyboard.
2015626	2017789	If it's something that you want, then you can pick it up.
2017869	2021713	You don't need to necessarily go and buy, you know, some brand new stuff.
2021993	2025757	And the instruments that they released this year, because they do have standalone instruments for Rock Band 3,
2026357	2036421	They're not really, other than the pro guitar that they have out there, and then the guitar that's a real guitar, other than those optional instruments, all the instruments are the same.
2038241	2042263	Dan was just saying today how he wanted the wireless Logitech guitar controller.
2043593	2045396	For Rockhand.
2045856	2046357	No, he wants it.
2047819	2048961	The higher quality, better made.
2049261	2051724	But he pointed it out and said, this is what I want.
2052646	2059795	So I think that the whole plastic instrument thing argument can go right down the toilet because an enthusiast is gonna buy them.
2060345	2061105	I have a guitar.
2061125	2062346	I have a Fender guitar.
2062406	2065667	It's actually a wood guitar that's made for Rock Band.
2065707	2067488	It was a $300 guitar at one time.
2067788	2069148	Got it for a third the price.
2069568	2071449	But it's pretty awesome.
2071669	2075511	Let me ask this question when you guys talk about music games dying and all this stuff.
2075951	2078672	Would you consider Child of Eden a music game?
2080212	2080312	No.
2080592	2082073	I never really consider Child of Eden.
2083351	2085412	No, you know what I'm talking about, or is it Children of Eden?
2085492	2086953	I've never really considered it.
2086973	2087673	And I have that pre-ordered.
2087813	2089214	I cannot wait to get that game.
2089334	2092916	But Children of Eden, you know, the res-y... Yeah, but I never considered it.
2094317	2095377	Like, you don't want to buy it?
2095397	2096398	You're not interested in it at all?
2096638	2099840	No, just, I keep forgetting about it because I have a lot of other stuff going on.
2100340	2103882	Well, it's not also going to be out this year anyway.
2103902	2108224	Yeah, it's like, I haven't really bothered to think about it until it comes an option for me to be able to get.
2108703	2115725	Well, the reason why I'm throwing that out there is because maybe we're looking at an evolution of music games or something new.
2115805	2119686	And I think that's just what the music game genre needs is something new that's interesting.
2120106	2130528	And this whole Kinect slash Move slash whatever, 3DS even, could bring us kind of the next interesting thing in gaming.
2130568	2134669	But as far as the whole plastic guitars and drums, I think there's only so much you can do with that.
2135269	2163951	and it's really hard to surpass what Rock Band 3 is bringing to the table and it is and honestly Rock Band 3's features aren't for everyone and it's basically the response both companies, both Harmonix and both Activision understand that maybe their sales are taking a hit a little bit and the music games aren't exactly as I should say not necessarily as popular but aren't making as big of a splash anymore as they were previously
2164771	2168916	And with Rock Band though, they haven't really been trying to put out tons of releases.
2168956	2176884	I mean, the Green Day thing was kind of a one-off thing and then the Beatles, that was kind of something different where it was mainly that was just going to be all-inclusive in it.
2177104	2182389	And yeah, I know they had the Lego Rock Band game, but that was more of a grab to try to get the family audience in there.
2182409	2183551	It also wasn't Harmonix.
2184987	2188770	Um, well, they developed it, but it was Warner Brothers, yeah, that published it.
2189331	2193614	Oh, I thought another developer kind of took the Rock Band code and did it.
2193634	2195736	Uh, yeah, I know what you mean, Traveler's Hills, yeah.
2195776	2196557	Yeah, yeah, that's it.
2196597	2199800	But anyways, but that game had an awesome soundtrack, and I, you know...
2200220	2203223	I'm actually trying to find a copy of Lego Rock Band for super cheap.
2203243	2207186	I think I could just order it on Amazon for like $14 just to get the songs in my Rock Band 3 collection.
2207206	2207847	It really is worth it.
2208608	2212131	But other than that, I mean, they've kind of taken it two different routes.
2212491	2217396	Guitar Hero decided this year that they're going to go back to their roots, they said, and make it all about rock.
2218236	2220438	And that's cool and all.
2220799	2224682	And they had a decent track list and stuff like that.
2224762	2224882	But
2226378	2254852	it's not like that big a deal I mean if you like the songs cool and you can buy them and you know upgrade and stuff like that but it's not like it's adding new ways to play the game other than this quest mode that and they have like challenges per songs and stuff like that download content that's neat but it's just it doesn't seem like a lot worse Rock Band 3 they went ahead added new instruments new pro modes new lessons and stuff like that you know harmonies
2255973	2259676	Just a bunch of stuff to it, and plus it has a library of thousands of songs.
2260837	2266181	Let me throw this out there too, speaking of this whole next evolution of the music-based game and so forth.
2266241	2267001	Think about this too.
2267902	2269643	I think you have to consider this a music game.
2269743	2274467	What is the number one Kinect title going to be this holiday season, besides Kinect Adventures, the pack-in game?
2274747	2275127	Dance Central.
2275147	2276148	It's going to be Dance Central.
2276468	2278228	Dance Central made by Harmonix.
2278688	2280809	So, you know, that's going to be a big thing for them, I think.
2281049	2286771	And, you know, even if not everybody is into dancing, it just shows you there are other things that haven't been done yet.
2286831	2288392	And they've already got download content for it.
2288532	2289612	No.
2290112	2290332	All right.
2290552	2291353	Anyway, let's move on.
2291453	2293253	Sorry, I don't want to spend too much time on this.
2293293	2297355	But, you know, we have a soft spot for music-based games here at OLR.
2298395	2301537	Speaking of the Kinect though, this is somewhat interesting slash exciting.
2301617	2304439	A new open source Kinect camera driver has been released.
2304839	2310922	So, you know, ever since the Kinect came out, it's been everybody's job to try and hack it slash crack it.
2311042	2316666	Although some people have criticized me like earlier this evening about my usage of that term.
2317046	2322949	Whatever you want to call it, people are using the Kinect for their own purposes on the PC.
2322969	2323669	Yeah.
2324910	2334214	A hacker by the name of Hector Martin has managed to do basically what the NUI group's Alex P announced that they did, the whole connect functionality versus the PC.
2334934	2336895	Martin released his code out to the public.
2337815	2341516	So you can actually see what that looks like when you're running it there.
2341876	2343457	They have like a little YouTube up right there.
2345198	2352241	All it does right now is it displays what the Kinect quote-unquote sees right now, kind of using little RGB.
2352261	2355303	It looks like one of those thermal cams when you're kind of looking at what it sees.
2355923	2358905	So very interesting that the driver is out there.
2359605	2360086	DarkSakura
2386026	2392390	Anyhow, also something to throw out there is that there is now a Homebrew PC Connect photo app that is out there.
2392790	2395872	It's by the coder Flowemuc.
2397473	2399814	It's proof of concept, what they call application.
2400454	2407739	And there's another YouTube video out there using Connect to track the hand movements, manipulating, resizing photos.
2408499	2411801	He has not released the software yet, but it's out there on YouTube.
2412281	2413002	So there it is.
2414302	2420527	and this is all done within the course of a few weeks so imagine what we're going to be looking at early next year as far as PC homebrew stuff goes.
2421768	2425210	These people have more free time than I do anyway.
2426551	2427351	Hey, you know what though?
2428272	2431274	Better your free time on this than, I don't know, World of Warcraft.
2432355	2433196	Says the addict.
2433816	2434597	Or Star Trek Online.
2435777	2437258	Which I play maybe once a week.
2437559	2439160	Okay, justify, justify, justify.
2439520	2440581	For 18 hours at a stretch.
2440601	2440741	Yeah.
2443047	2444548	More like one or two.
2445509	2447771	Mr. I have scheduled raids on Wednesday.
2448551	2449592	This week, we'll see.
2449652	2451174	Scheduled raids.
2451234	2452314	Hanging out with friends.
2452375	2453415	I know them all in real life.
2453435	2454156	Scheduled raids.
2454196	2454616	Almost.
2455497	2457699	You could also go out for pizza together.
2458720	2459860	I didn't go this last.
2459961	2461262	Why am I justifying this to you?
2462383	2463003	I don't care.
2463023	2464804	Screw you.
2465745	2466666	Judge, judge, judge.
2468880	2471122	Well, how about Nintendo?
2471422	2474205	See, this is almost douchey, but not quite.
2475086	2477949	They trademarked the phrase it's on like Donkey Kong.
2479170	2482893	Sorry, SSJ100Matt said in chat, I don't know, JB did play Second Life.
2485296	2486196	I do love the chatters.
2488098	2488899	Oh yeah, Donkey Kong, hey.
2491707	2493988	It's Nintendo's phrase now.
2520074	2521834	So now I'm just gonna say it's on, like, Pong.
2523335	2526835	Well, I mean, like, I don't even like that saying, to be honest.
2526955	2527736	I've never used it.
2527796	2534577	No matter where this kind of argument stands, like, I don't even use the phrase it's on, like, Donkey Kong, because you know what?
2534957	2537357	When it comes to my gaming on the Wii, it's off.
2538278	2540278	Like, it's unplugged, actually.
2541058	2543059	Mine has a layer of dust on it right now.
2543459	2545459	Yeah, it's sitting in a box somewhere.
2546459	2548120	I've been playing a lot of stuff on my iPhone.
2550709	2577069	so uh yeah I mean have have fun I guess with the trademark but um I guess if they want to sell shirts or whatever didn't the didn't the Scott Pilgrim movie use that in like their trailers and the um uh posters and stuff maybe that's what they were trying to do is although it's kind of ironic because um kind of comes full circle because there was the whole King Kong thing from Universal and then Universal has the Scott Pilgrim well forget it yeah it's actually not that interesting at all
2579909	2582090	I'm just rolling my eyes.
2582150	2583630	They just want to sell t-shirts.
2584070	2584711	Yeah.
2584731	2585831	They're just waiting.
2586571	2587151	Yeah.
2588272	2588692	Damn them.
2589152	2590772	So, it's off.
2592073	2592733	Don't care.
2592813	2594173	You can say it's on like Tron.
2594193	2594994	That makes more sense.
2595614	2597935	Because Tron is cooler than Donkey Kong.
2598755	2599855	It's on like Tron?
2601296	2602136	It rhymes!
2602196	2604577	Donkey Kong Country was an awesome game.
2604937	2608958	It is an awesome game, and I like how the new game is like, you know,
2611226	2628642	Actdeft in our chatroom says, and numerous people are referencing this in chat too, Actdeft says, Sky, yeah, the Scott Pilgrim trailers use that phrase.
2629843	2632005	Don't kid yourself, that's what this is really about.
2633959	2637802	This isn't... Never mind.
2638603	2640525	So we talk about stupid Donkey Kong.
2640565	2641606	That's what it was about.
2642346	2643187	Well, it worked.
2643547	2648332	It was on CNN and MSNBC and every freaking news station ran with it.
2648492	2653156	I feel terrible for contributing to the promotion of that game, so I'm just not going to buy it.
2655632	2659513	Oh wait, I was going to not buy it anyway, so that's so funny.
2662734	2672317	A game that people purchased a lot of recently, not Call of Duty, because Call of Duty did sell a lot as well, but it took Fallout New Vegas just a little bit longer.
2673157	2681540	They did sell 5 million units as well, and I guess combined with a heavy volume of digital downloads,
2682340	2686241	The game stands to generate $300 million in sales.
2687742	2694604	And it says, of course, that they are working to patch the game to fix the numerous bugs that were in there.
2699825	2700566	Whatever, you know.
2701786	2708728	We can rant on and on about how games get released unfinished just so that they can sell them and have people test them.
2710529	2710910	Whatever.
2711832	2713956	Yeah, so there's going to be a PC patch coming out soon.
2714016	2718085	I think there is already a patch that's in the works for the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, so...
2721168	2724592	Breakman in our chatroom is asking, is Fallout New Vegas fixed yet?
2724652	2725873	Kind of, I guess, a reference to the story.
2725893	2727375	Because that game is broken as fuck.
2727795	2728636	It's not fixed yet.
2729157	2730098	But it will be soon.
2730198	2730738	Don't worry.
2732600	2734182	You're just going to have a broken game for a while.
2734202	2735703	How broken is broken as fuck?
2735743	2738706	Is it seriously like we're talking no boss shows up on level 30?
2739687	2743071	They're having save issues where I think save games are getting erased.
2744224	2744985	Oh, that sucks.
2745526	2747088	Is it Cogwheel Cursor Broken?
2749891	2750592	Nice reference.
2750612	2751473	Wow reference, sorry.
2752555	2756941	They're also doing some tweaks for NVIDIA graphics card users.
2758002	2761006	And I guess there's some problems with the Havoc drivers.
2762475	2765576	KC in our chatroom at chat.originalsradio.com says, Yeah, right.
2765596	2766236	You already bought it.
2766296	2766896	Why fix it?
2768316	2768716	They will.
2768896	2769756	I trust that they will.
2769776	2773277	I mean, Fallout 3, I think, was kind of the same issue.
2773297	2775358	They had the same issues where it was buggy.
2775778	2780899	And, you know, even like with Oblivion and stuff, they had a lot of buggy stuff in there that they went and patched.
2780959	2782779	I mean, those games are pretty complex.
2782899	2786380	But, once again, that's still no excuse for testing your games.
2787040	2787340	But...
2788985	2797252	I mean, I understand why they release it when they do because, you know, especially towards the holidays, getting your game to a duplicator to get it done.
2797332	2806699	I mean, there's such a backlog with duplicators right now that you have to release it then in order to make it out before Call of Duty comes out.
2809281	2814746	But still, though, I mean, put a little bit more effort into, you know, testing your games for bugs.
2816772	2818353	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2835626	2855858	Back, sort of, to where it was before It's now under the Games and Demos section of the Xbox Live Marketplace So, yeah, and there was no dashboard update or anything So they must have done all that updating on the server end somehow So, yeah, some interesting feedback in the Microsoft forums There's, of course, celebrating going on
2856278	2857579	Microsoft is listening.
2857659	2859279	Indie games are back in the game section.
2859339	2860560	We are having an effect.
2860900	2863701	The new placement isn't perfect because they want to be front and center.
2863941	2865661	But it's a huge step in the right direction.
2865721	2869443	The icon feels very out of place being such a different style and searches and so forth.
2869803	2873004	It doesn't look like indie games are included but we are in the game section.
2873504	2875385	So congrats, they're back.
2875685	2879126	And you know, it seems like a logical place for them to be.
2879746	2881847	And I can see why they were kind of mad the first time.
2881867	2883368	But what's also very interesting...
2884108	2891851	Not only is it that, there's now going to be this developer-led initiative going on called Indie Games Winter Uprising.
2892831	2898994	It's not quite the same thing that you would think as Summer of Arcade because it's not Microsoft sponsoring this.
2899394	2902115	This is actually a developer-enabled thing.
2902795	2909538	But they're going to actually price over a dozen games in Indie Games between 80 to 400 Microsoft points.
2910238	2914240	So the developers are going to take a hit to try and bring more notice to the indie games.
2914380	2915800	Which means Microsoft takes a cut too.
2915920	2920302	But a lot of the indie games are already 80 Microsoft points too.
2920622	2921722	400 Microsoft points.
2922202	2923983	So it's not like they're really going to be doing anything.
2924223	2927324	Well, supposedly these are like big indie titles.
2927384	2929245	I mean, I'm not sure exactly what that means.
2929585	2930365	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2949554	2950916	or something or, you know.
2951257	2955323	And I think that's kind of what the developers want is they just want Microsoft to throw them a bone.
2955363	2957246	It's not like Microsoft ain't making money on it.
2957407	2964458	Yeah, but the problem with these developers though is they're pissed off that there's a lot of like cheap crappy games like all these massage apps and stuff like that.
2964818	2966759	Hey, BabyMaker Extreme is awesome.
2966859	2967519	But you know what?
2967579	2970720	You just need to suck it up and get over it.
2970780	2976042	Because that's what there is on the stupid Apple App Store and stuff like that.
2976102	2978402	You have to differentiate your product.
2978742	2980543	And I understand there's a lot of massage apps.
2980603	2982664	But people are buying them.
2982844	2987685	Unless you're making a massage app, who gives a crap what other massage apps are out there?
2987725	2989886	And yes, I understand that people are dumb and will...
2990586	2991086	and many more.
3017916	3025821	I don't ever get contacted by indie developers on this show, save for the ones you've already heard on this program in the past, like YYR and a couple others.
3026282	3031765	But I'm just saying, indie developers, maybe you need to aim a little lower.
3034407	3040171	Stop trying to go for the big, big coverage and come to indie shows and things like that.
3040571	3043894	I will happily have indie developers on that want to pimp their games.
3043934	3044694	Just send us an email.
3044714	3045875	You know what I mean?
3047366	3049549	There's plenty of outlets for them to do that kind of stuff.
3051411	3052733	So, alright, we'll see what happens.
3054515	3058220	DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get into the release dates and then the Classic Game of the Week?
3058240	3059021	It's not that far away either.
3059264	3060284	I love that word, fushigi.
3089272	3112329	So yeah, they have had to change the 22,000 word dictionary And it's going to be a budget release on top of that Interesting But speculation is that they're already working on localizing the sequel as well No word on if it's being changed as far as aesthetically, cosmetically
3113314	3120500	Now when you say localized, you mean they are changing as well all of the words and things to be in Japanese language.
3120520	3121921	Localizing it for Japan.
3122202	3123923	That has got to be a pain in the ass.
3124543	3130488	Oh yes, because I honestly think that there's going to have to be more universal memes there used.
3131109	3132210	What alphabet are they going to use?
3133691	3137314	I would expect that they're going to use the... What's that?
3137354	3138695	It's kanji and katakana?
3138855	3140497	I think they're going to use all of them, I would hope.
3141841	3169610	probably use the you know how iPhone with the iPhone you can actually just type it in either way and it will bring up the kanji dictionary that will let you pick which one or like using the shift just translate changer on Windows okay yeah I would expect it would work the same way I wonder if low cats are going to be in it and all the other internet memes or if they kind of took those out because maybe it's not president cat yeah they should put president cat in the game that'd be awesome yeah
3171141	3179561	but I'm not going to hold my breath let's travel around the world and look at some releases coming soon to a store near you we'll start in the US, Loki
3180135	3186779	Still keeping up with lots of releases coming out, and I think this is probably going to be the last big week, and it's going to start dying down.
3187699	3193383	Today, actually, was the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong Miniland Mayhem on the Nintendo DS.
3193823	3197445	Also this Sunday, there was also U-Draw.
3197465	3203468	Hold on, is that that same puzzle game series that started a long time ago on the Game Boy Advance, the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games?
3203488	3204069	Yeah, the ones like Lemons.
3204089	3204369	Wow.
3204869	3206330	I never realized that was such a huge series.
3207531	3208752	Well, tell Nintendo.
3209092	3210033	They don't seem to understand.
3211053	3213355	It wasn't a bad game the first time.
3213415	3218378	It wasn't a bad game, but I mean, I could think of them developing some other games, though, that might not be so bad.
3219219	3220540	People like Mario games.
3221281	3222641	I mean, standard Mario games.
3223642	3224803	It's on like Mario.
3225323	3226224	Don't go too crazy.
3226704	3228986	Some people like myself may like Mario RPG.
3229246	3229727	Just a thought.
3231619	3254729	you draw they're coming out with the tablet plus the drawing software and then Dude's Big Adventure which is some doodling platformer game and Pictionary because everyone loves Pictionary and of course Pictionary for the DS so that's all today and then of course this week we have NBA Jam coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 for the almost full price of $50 instead of $60 okay it's $10 cheaper
3259011	3283680	Sims 3 for the Wii kind of delayed from the rest of the other console versions Marvel Super Heroes Squad the Infinity Gauntlet on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Wii I concur it's terrible it's like Marvel Super Hero Babies or something like that National Geographic Challenge Wildlife on PlayStation 3 and Wii
3286598	3288039	Pac-Man Party.
3290882	3291783	That's coming out on the Wii.
3292804	3296607	Barbie, Groom, and Glam Pups on the Wii and DS.
3297028	3301552	Is there a single listener of Orange Launch Radio that's going to be picking up Barbie, Groom, and Glam Pups?
3302653	3305936	No, but it is... Then why do we list them on the release dates?
3306497	3308439	Because they're coming out, okay?
3308639	3310240	I don't care about all of these titles.
3310260	3311702	Well, maybe it should stay in.
3312082	3318665	People go to jail over protesting cosmetic use on animals and you have a game where you have to put mascara on a dog or something.
3318705	3321407	I don't even want to know what that game involves.
3321427	3326149	You gave your cat a perm.
3326429	3326849	20 points.
3327830	3329971	That's pretty much the Chocobo game on Facebook.
3331141	3333183	Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii.
3333263	3339549	Yes, that's not confusing at all, just repeating the title because, oh yeah, it's going back to its roots, I guess.
3340269	3348297	Will that work as well as it did on Kyriek Revolution, the game that everybody forgot was even out there that you said you were going to support with download content but never did?
3351472	3375063	Namco Museum Megamix It's more Namco arcade games for the Wii Split Second on PSP this week Apache Air Assault on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and I believe PC as well We'll skip past all this crap since you don't want to talk about iCarly 2
3375763	3379910	iCarly, I believe it's I joined the clique.
3381253	3382435	I think that's what it was called.
3382815	3383998	I stabbed myself.
3384952	3391234	And then I told you, I don't know if I mentioned this last week, but Reload Target Down on the Wii.
3391434	3393415	It is a target shooting game.
3393455	3394395	That's right.
3394755	3396916	You don't actually kill real people in it.
3397536	3398356	That's terrible.
3398817	3399437	What's the point?
3399637	3400457	Yes, exactly.
3400597	3402438	Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon on the Wii.

3419189	3420750	That's $100, by the way.
3421090	3423773	That's coming out on the Wii.
3423913	3425434	Hello Kitty Seasons.
3425674	3428177	What does that come with to justify the $100 price?
3428197	3431640	Does it come with one of those full training dummies that you slam into to try and tackle?
3432040	3432801	For your living room?
3432901	3436184	No, they actually do have, it's a set of wireless sensors.
3437005	3439607	They've got a pedometer, some sort of thing built in.
3440168	3441930	It's a bunch of sensors and whatnot.
3442430	3443311	Heart rate monitors.
3443451	3444172	For your ass.
3444873	3446234	For your ass, yes, that's right.
3446634	3448857	Because your ass has its own heart.
3449657	3451799	Nine hours, nine persons, nine doors.
3452160	3454802	That's on Nintendo DS this week.
3455643	3456464	Why'd you even ask?
3458163	3462346	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1.
3462927	3471693	It's coming out on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, PC, and I believe the Xbox 360 version.
3471733	3473395	You can cast spells with the Kinect.
3474636	3476057	EA Sports Active 2.0.
3476377	3477698	That's also $100 each.
3477818	3479640	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
3479980	3482962	And on top of all that, you need the Move or Kinect.
3483482	3484043	Well, then the Wii.
3484063	3485464	You just need the Wii stuff.
3485484	3487786	That's expensive all around.
3489786	3491147	Um... Other fun stuff this week.
3491167	3492327	And there is some fun stuff.
3492807	3494047	And this is pretty awesome.
3494167	3495568	Need for Speed Hot Pursuit.
3496068	3500589	Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3501449	3502929	And this is from Criterion.
3502949	3505490	I mean, the guys behind the Burnout series.
3505510	3506430	So you know it's going to be good.
3507690	3510130	Sonic Colors on the Wii and Nintendo DS.
3511911	3512051	Um...
3514002	3526033	and then there's this game called Create which is from EA they're trying to make it like some sort of LittleBigPlanet thing but really it's not that's on PC, Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii and
3532728	3559889	and finally rounding things out here Zumba Fitness it's some Latin dance exercise thing I keep seeing infomercials for it early in the morning because I have to get up with the baby Xbox 360 Wii and Playstation 3 and of course those do support the Move and Connect DECA Sports Freedom that is a Kinect game that's based off that Wii game that they put out and then finally I'm told those DECA Sports games do really well
3560441	3563044	They do, actually, and they're not too terrible.
3563064	3564766	Remember, we played DECA Sports 1 a long time ago.
3564786	3567388	Yeah, because they had curling, which made it the best.
3567408	3568029	Figure skating.
3568049	3569931	Made it the best.
3570532	3572013	I hope they have figure skating on the Kinect.
3572033	3573635	That would be tons of fun to do in my living room.
3573675	3576057	I don't think they have figure skating, but they have some other stuff.
3576157	3577599	I could be my own Brian Boitano.
3578681	3580122	and then Pro Evolution Soccer 2011.
3580382	3581663	And that's it.
3582263	3584705	That was on the Wii, of course.
3584765	3590768	Looking in our chat room at chat.orange.com, Frisbee says, speaking of worthless, whatever happened to the vitality sensor?
3590848	3591489	Good question.
3593910	3594371	Never came out.
3595211	3595491	Okay.
3596012	3597693	Maybe that'll be the big thing in XT3.
3597833	3602295	Well, if you remember, though, Ubisoft does have their own version of that that's on PC, though.
3602315	3602876	Remember that?
3602896	3607539	I don't remember what the hell it was called, but it was just like, okay, breathe in and out.
3608539	3609540	Breathe in and out of the game.
3609560	3610821	We relax, right, or whatever?
3611081	3611401	I don't know.
3611481	3613062	It wasn't real.
3613382	3614343	Breathe the game.
3614583	3615504	I like to breathe.
3616284	3619106	All right, let's go to our Japanese release dates.
3619186	3619587	Hooray.
3620587	3625010	Call of Duty Black Ops gets a subtitle edition released in Japan this week on November 18th.
3625991	3634759	EA Sports, MMA, The Sims 3, Crossboard 7, and Dance Evolution all as well come out this week on the Xbox 360.
3635099	3637622	In fact, I think this is the big week for Kinect in Japan.
3637682	3640925	November 20th is their launch day over there, so it's about, what, six days away?
3641445	3642526	20 is an important number.
3643247	3643467	Is it?
3643647	3644088	Yes, it is.
3644508	3645008	Crossboard 7, Karada de...

3690723	3696367	Kinect Sports, Sonic Free Riders, and that's all I'm seeing for their releases out the gate.
3696627	3699969	So I don't know if it's just not as huge of a launch over there or what.
3700149	3703150	And that brain training game, it's by the guy that did Brain Age.
3703651	3708053	Very interesting that there's no localized Dance Central, so the only dance game they're going to have is Dance Masters.
3708794	3709234	Interesting.
3710605	3715371	PlayStation 3, Agarest Senkei 2 comes out in regular and limited edition.
3717794	3718895	Why are you laughing over there?

3720817	3721979	Remember the breeding game?
3722059	3722539	Oh, yes.
3724382	3725223	Oh my gosh.

3756810	3757871	Is it based on the new series?
3758212	3758672	I don't know.
3760974	3763435	It looks like a card game and it has clips from the anime in it.
3764735	3766756	Oh, is it a pachinko game or a card game?
3767036	3767696	I think it's pachinko.
3768657	3770257	Oh yeah, that looks like a pachinko game.
3770297	3771718	That part does, but I don't know.
3771758	3772498	There might be more to it.
3772518	3774119	It might be a party game or something.

3781321	3785263	Nikudan comes out this week as well from Sony in Japan.
3785463	3788564	I don't know what game this is, but it's like a fighting game that uses the move.
3789304	3789784	What is this?
3789824	3791264	That's the fight the lights out.
3792245	3793165	Is this out here already?
3793345	3793645	Yeah.

3948590	3952494	Super Crate Box or Crepe Box.
3952534	3954897	Because I was like, mmm, a crepe sounds really good right now.
3954917	3956639	I don't know about you guys, but like a crepe.
3956799	3957980	It doesn't have anything for it.
3958280	3960042	It is a Super Crate Box.
3961043	3962105	Like, isn't that redundant?
3963466	3964167	Crate Box?
3964187	3966109	Well, it's a box that you store crates in.
3966269	3966990	It makes sense.
3968229	3970010	That makes as much sense as Forklift.
3971371	3975354	They're talking about that criminal girls game in our chat room and Breakman is like, criminal girls?
3975394	3976755	I hope it's a girls prison game.
3977155	3979777	And Frisbee chimes in with, okay girls, shower time.
3980158	3981219	You guys all need to get laid.
3981479	3981959	Seriously.
3985122	3986142	Nothing wrong with that.
3987724	3989285	They're just trying to be cleanly.
3992774	3995556	So, how about that Microsoft?
3995576	3996136	How about it?
3996597	3997597	How about them?
3998198	3999999	They are suing Motorola.
4001060	4006483	Not because of some bad phone deal, but apparently they licensed some technology from Motorola.
4007424	4009125	And Motorola decided, hey, you know what?
4009165	4009945	We want more money.
4010706	4017631	And they've been charging royalties that are excessive and discriminatory, according to Microsoft.
4018471	4026593	And apparently, I guess this is regarding its video decoding and wireless LAN technology.
4026653	4029113	I guess that's incorporated into the Xbox 360.
4030614	4042436	And apparently they are going to court over it to see whether or not Microsoft does pay those excessive royalties that Motorola thinks that are deserved.
4044697	4044877	Hmm.
4047580	4066396	yay lawsuits there's always some lawsuits somebody suing somebody over something oh yeah will this change gaming as we know it or is this just kind of a cock waving competition it's just I don't think it's going to change anything it's just about right it just means that they make less money
4066618	4073521	You know, maybe if you were investing in Microsoft or Motorola that might matter to you, but probably not.
4073641	4077463	And if Microsoft loses the case, they'll just pass the expense on to the consumers.
4079224	4081385	And then the sun will continue to rise tomorrow.
4082025	4082525	Exactly.
4083546	4083766	Nice.
4084926	4092671	By the way, I don't mean to backtrack, but sometimes the chat room is a little lagged, but I'm getting some tells about the Stitch game that we were talking about before.
4093551	4095292	Stitch Jam is what it was called.
4095332	4097694	Stitch Jam, but the Japanese version of Stitch Jam.
4097954	4099235	Apparently they're liking it over there.
4099255	4100736	Famitsu's giving it a silver rating.
4101196	4105078	So just because they're based off of movies does not necessarily mean they're...
4108815	4109675	Well, yeah.
4109795	4111256	I mean, Famitsu's harsh.
4111516	4112496	At least they used to be.
4112516	4118057	Well, if you want it now, I'm sure it's dirt cheap because it's been out since March and it wasn't that hot of a seller.
4118117	4120837	In fact, it wasn't really much of a seller at all.
4120957	4122998	I wonder if it's going to do better over there than it did here.
4123838	4124158	Interesting.
4124178	4126119	Stitch is super, super popular.
4126799	4127979	That makes sense, actually.
4128039	4134120	Like, you can get, like, total... The UFO catchers, like, are just totally Stitch-loaded in some places.
4135220	4136261	Stitch is adorable, though.
4136281	4137081	Stitch is great.
4138021	4138341	All right.
4140785	4141746	Instant Action Instant Action
4160505	4161326	and DarkSakura.com
4190364	4203375	Uh, yeah, I guess there's also a comment that was made to the Kotaku website in that, uh, quote, it was an operating in a highly competitive industry and the business didn't scale profitably in the manner we had expected.
4203815	4210761	Well, unfortunately, you know, some of these things just take kind of time to build and it doesn't sound like they had a huge catalog of the streaming games.
4211682	4235083	and you know I think in order to make a splash you've got to kind of have that must-have game that's available through your technology and unfortunately Monkey Island as good of a game as it was just wasn't it because it had already been out for a little while and I think most people that wanted to play it probably already did so bummer hopefully those guys that were able to land on their feet again in new positions somewhere very soon or maybe that whole torque powered thing will work out who knows
4235804	4241003	Anyhow, it's now time for the part of our show where we will take a trip down memory lane
4243271	4244452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4269349	4274094	Rob's text to me was, I have to read this because this is funny.
4275175	4276416	Hold on, where is it?
4277217	4278038	I just lulled.
4279280	4279980	I did.
4280020	4281762	When I said I'd put it out.
4282723	4283845	Well, tell us what it is already.
4283885	4284866	I can't stand the suspense.
4285767	4286608	Paradise.
4287569	4290012	And I picked the long version of my favorite song from that one.
4298516	4302477	Tell me you don't want to shake your butt to this.
4302537	4311921	One, two, three, two, three, two, one.
4311941	4312181	Tokyo!
4312201	4313301	Those chicks can't count.
4314661	4317062	Eh, they use different numbers in Japan.
4317582	4327406	Okay, Para Para Paradise, which was made by Konami, and it is a Domani game, and it's for para para dancing!
4329113	4351023	It uses a motion sensor controller that's in an octagonal platform shape and has five directional sensors that lets you, where it is, you've got power power mode where you do all the set actual routines for the songs and freestyle mode where you can dance around however you want to as long as you hit them or like Iguana Girl does, goth dance.
4353348	4356190	I've seen all sorts of creative interpretations to the dancing in this game.
4356210	4356870	It's pretty awesome.
4357230	4360132	I've seen people just use their pelvis, actually, to activate the arrows.
4360532	4361173	Yes, it is.
4361553	4364095	I've seen people do it with just their legs.
4364115	4365515	Pretending they have their penis out.
4365636	4367937	Or, in some cases, in the privacy of their own home, not pretending.
4368433	4370194	If you've got the pink biscuits, then you do.
4370594	4371934	Well, there were different versions.
4371954	4381497	There was, of course, the first mix, and then there was the second mix that had the actual models dancing along with you mirrored so that you could see them.
4381677	4390680	And it even had a learn the para mode, learn the dance mode, which that's how I learned a few of them was playing that.
4390741	4392841	I think Stockton Goffland still has theirs.
4394102	4394822	I need to get back there.
4395462	4397144	Um, yeah, it was super fun.
4397484	4400967	It had, um, uh, for the, uh, U.S.
4401507	4402448	Oh, not U.S., what am I saying?
4402488	4403369	We never got it over here.
4403689	4412756	For the, uh, home version, it had, um, actual, uh, dancers that you could play in mirrored mode, or it had it in the corner.
4413236	4414277	You could watch, learn it, too.
4414457	4416179	Which is what Dance Masters is now.
4416659	4416919	Yeah.
4417240	4419481	Well, Dance Masters is, it defaults mirrored.
4420322	4421163	So, that's pretty cool.
4422003	4422083	Um...
4424777	4444909	It basically, it was really neat, I thought, because it was something, now, I'll tell you what, I had actually just heard about Parapara dancing right about the same time the game came out, and then I saw pictures of people playing, I was like, they're doing those little dances!
4445669	4447811	The first time we ever met was over at Power, Power, Paradise.
4447831	4448492	Yes, it was.
4448952	4455298	And that was, I learned like half of Eurobeat, that particular song.
4455458	4457040	Your song's over, so I'm going to play one of mine.
4457240	4459081	Okay.
4459162	4460343	It's in Dance Masters, actually.
4460383	4460903	Like a Virgin?
4461404	4465587	No, where, oh, these are all people playing the stupid game.
4465648	4467489	No, I do love that song, though.
4467509	4468310	Let me see if I can find that.
4468390	4469571	It's by Virginelle, I think.
4470492	4471313	God, how do I know this?
4471753	4480177	Well, and also one of our listeners has been kind of hooking me up with lots and lots and lots of Super Eurobeat CDs and Dance Manias and stuff.
4480357	4483439	I've been quite the pleased little fangirl.
4486520	4494725	But yeah, I mean, and the other thing with the whole Parapara genre is that it really came up with the whole Gyaru Saba.
4495545	4496125	Oh, you found it?
4496545	4497026	Was I right?
4498206	4498426	Huh.
4501365	4502486	Sorry, I just wanted the bones in there.
4504747	4510151	It was really attached very strongly to the Gyaru subculture too, which is actually still going on.
4510171	4512312	You know, 10 plus you're strong.
4512953	4517315	But it doesn't necessarily mean that they all para para and go to clubs.
4517416	4522219	Velfar, the song that, the first song, got Rob sitting in his chair doing the damn dance.
4523660	4528403	And, uh, but, uh, the club- I can't believe I remember this.
4528483	4529804	I feel so gay right now.
4531184	4540687	But the big Parapara club, Belfar, that that song was made for, since it's gone out of business, I think, or it's turned into a different place.
4541008	4555553	But yeah, I mean, there were all kinds of Avex tracks, songs like Belfar 2000, Anniversary, Boom Boom Fire, some of the J-Euro tracks, which my favorite was Deluxe, because that was the one where you shook your butt really a lot.
4557119	4558620	Rob's back to doing the dance again.
4573867	4602209	but there was a Korean version called Parapara Dancing that was pretty much mostly Korean music like it had BoA and SES and it had a version of Hold On Me done in Korean and it said that you could I guess play front to back and it had some in the back so you could face instead of facing the machine you could face the crowd so you could dance to them
4603803	4612459	And by the way, Rob was looking at the video that I have been watching to relearn the dances.
4613767	4615148	This is not a playthrough.
4615208	4616910	It's a little piggy crying wee wee wee.
4617030	4618551	Stupid advertisements.
4618591	4619392	I'll talk over it.
4619492	4620593	Alright.
4620833	4623435	Then there was an open source one.
4623635	4626037	Stepmania had support for Power of Paradise.
4626858	4629140	And then there's one called Power of Star.
4629320	4631202	That's a Stepmania 4.0 modification.
4631222	4632563	You can get it at Club Power of Star.
4632703	4633684	If you just look up their website.
4634825	4634905	Um...
4636485	4642106	Then, uh, they're actually, the main developers are trying to, uh, crack it.
4642146	4643487	They've gotten pretty far with it.
4643587	4647888	They've gotten through the test menu, but they can't operate it since they can't find the input ports.
4649228	4649848	And there you have it.
4649888	4651268	Rob, you gonna turn this one up?
4652048	4652489	I can't.
4652569	4653309	It's not playing.
4653669	4654069	There we go.
4654149	4654549	There we go.
4657169	4658110	This is in Dance Masters.
4658130	4659490	Did you mention the Dreamcast one?
4660308	4661489	Dreamcast Dreampara
4691649	4696193	I actually was just wrong because it wouldn't be a neon green, it would be a dark green.
4696213	4697914	It would be the opposite of hot pink.
4698792	4699793	Anyway, that's a different story.
4700313	4702274	That's me going into color theory, sorry.
4702695	4704736	I'm just staring at this girl, she's so adorable.
4705096	4708499	You should watch her one for Velfar, because she's absolutely even more adorable.
4709119	4710760	She does the little happy pose.
4712181	4714563	So how is it detecting what she's doing?
4714623	4716945	Is it like a semicircle on the floor that she's standing in?
4716965	4718406	Well, she's actually just doing the dance.
4719606	4721928	But in the game, it has five sensors.
4722368	4726031	There's one to each side, one diagonally on each side, and then one in front of you.
4726551	4729852	So when you do your hand waving, it'll, it'll fit.
4732113	4739156	And it'll even, it doesn't necessarily register your height of where your hands are, it just measures that they're in the right position.
4740877	4741097	So.
4742078	4742618	Good times.
4742898	4744338	Yep, so it's para para paradise.
4745219	4747660	Your classic game of the week, para para paradise.
4749028	4750269	Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4750989	4754131	Old favorite from back in the Bomani fandom days.
4754191	4756553	Although I'm still a fan of Bomani, you know, back when it was good.
4757093	4757354	All right.
4757394	4761656	Anyhow, that's going to do it for part A. But hey, we have plenty more show to come.
4761716	4762357	Don't go anywhere.
4762397	4764578	When we come back, we're going to talk plenty more.
4764618	4766179	We have a lot of quick, quick news tonight.
4766219	4771363	Things about like Yars' Revenge, more Facebook games, Lame Castle, Naughty Bear 2, believe it or not.
4771923	4773924	We're going to talk about Black Ops a little bit.
4773984	4778166	I know it's not usually the type of game we get into on the show, but it's broken sales records.
4778206	4779386	We have to say something about it.
4779987	4783168	And talk a little bit about maybe a change in how to price games.
4783408	4784288	That would be nice, wouldn't it?
4784749	4787770	So we'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere.
4788770	4789731	We'll be back right after this.
4795854	4798476	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4798536	4806080	We are live on November the 14th of 2010 here for the 389th episode of our show.
4806160	4811824	Join us in our chat room if you are listening live because we do tape live every week Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
4811844	4819248	You can join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where some of the chatters were reacting to the music that we were playing during the break.
4819308	4820309	Some loved it, some hated it.
4820509	4821469	I guess we'll start off with Loki.
4840990	4843913	Yes, some rapid fire news here.
4844053	4848117	We've got news that... I don't know if this is too exciting.
4848437	4849878	I liked at least one of these games.
4850258	4854242	Wet 2 and Naughty Bear 2 are confirmed in development at Behavior.
4856464	4857965	Wet was kind of cool.
4858025	4860468	It was sort of supposed to be like a punk rock-ish...
4861048	4861688	Action Game.
4862389	4863329	I thought it was alright.
4863769	4866671	Naughty Bear 2 wasn't all that great.
4866691	4869592	Naughty Bear 2 was one of those things that looked great on paper.
4869672	4873754	Yeah, Naughty Bear, it was just kind of didn't do very well.
4873774	4875895	Well, it also just got raped by the critics.
4876295	4879297	And it's not for lack of reason.
4879317	4880097	It was kind of crap.
4882618	4886061	I'd actually like to go back and play Wet because I think that'd be pretty cool.
4886401	4889063	Naughty Bear 2, I really don't need to work on that.
4890424	4890684	Whatever.
4892645	4895988	This is kind of neat, I guess, if you're into the whole social gaming stuff.
4896488	4898830	Kinect Sports has an app now on Facebook.
4899450	4908512	and it'll allow you to actually track your players' league results and allow them to issue invitations to have others be invited.
4908932	4913033	And also, I guess, video highlights from the game.
4913253	4916213	I haven't played the game yet, so I guess it takes video of you.
4916753	4923315	And, of course, videos won't be shown unless you go ahead and give it the okay to do so.
4924195	4924535	But, yeah.
4925155	4927616	Yeah, that is available now on Facebook.
4928056	4931238	So if you want to check it out, go to apps.facebook.com.
4931358	4932658	Do you own Kinect Sports?
4932999	4933219	I do.
4933619	4933999	What do you think?
4934019	4934859	I haven't played it.
4935520	4937240	Like I just said, I haven't played it yet.
4937420	4937841	I'm sorry.
4938621	4939681	I don't have a lot of time.
4939762	4942543	And, you know, honestly, when it's like, well, I could try Kinect Sports.
4943783	4945925	or I could play Dance Central.
4946205	4954052	I saw like five seconds of it in a store, an electronic store where they had it on demo and the bowling game was up and it looked cute.
4954272	4955253	You know, that reminds me.
4955573	4959136	Since I went to Burger King before I came over here.
4959356	4959857	Plug, plug.
4959977	4963039	By the way, I had three of the buck doubles.
4963099	4969705	I stacked them onto a six patty burger and proceeded to eat that, which is slightly...
4970485	4975289	Better for me than eating the three burgers because I didn't eat all the buns to go along with it.
4975429	4976249	Slightly better.
4976550	4980673	That's eating three quarters of the carton of ice cream instead of the whole carton.
4981233	4981874	It was good for you.
4982634	4994483	But anyways, I just thought I'd mention for the Sacramento area listeners, actually, it's funny enough, this week the Connect Tour that Microsoft is doing is actually coming to the Burger King that I went to to get my food.
4995383	4999686	which would be on 7760 Sunrise Boulevard, Citrus Heights.
4999706	5004809	They're going to be there November 17th and 18th from 10.30 to 7.30 p.m.
5004890	5008912	So if you want to go check out some of the stuff and maybe get some swag.
5009713	5011554	Yeah, it's literally up the street from here.
5014736	5015897	You can go ahead and do that there.
5017558	5021540	Or xbox.com slash Burger King if you want to know those dates later on.
5021580	5022561	But yeah, that's later this week.
5022581	5023221	It's kind of cool.
5025042	5032885	Yeah, so if you're interested, like I said, if you're into social gaming, honestly, I would never use this because I hate when people do that kind of stuff.
5035246	5037387	Maybe I'm just not the right person for that kind of thing.
5038327	5039768	Finally, this is kind of cool.
5040308	5052373	Apparently, there is the PSP commercial where they were dissing, I guess, gaming on phones and whatnot, and they had a game called Lame Castle that was in this PSP commercial.
5052833	5053593	Lame Castle Lame Castle
5078407	5079687	Well, they're getting free advertising.
5079787	5080688	I mean, why not?
5081928	5082208	All right.
5082848	5085149	Some other news going on in the gaming world real quick here.
5085829	5089710	A little bit of a WoW story, but this is big enough to report on here.
5090450	5093191	There's now a dial-in Battle.net authenticator.
5093511	5098492	You know how WoW accounts are very prone to getting hacked sometimes by shady people?
5099172	5107554	Well, authenticators have been something that Blizzard's really been pushing, and if you have an iPhone or a Droid or really any mobile phone capable of running apps, you can get a free authenticator.
5107874	5108875	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5127973	5130375	It's basically a phone number that you can call.
5130415	5131236	It's an 800 number.
5131836	5138181	And any time that the game detects suspicious activity, the game will call you and give you a password to put in.
5138462	5139783	You basically give it a phone number.
5139803	5141444	You call this number.
5141504	5142465	I haven't used it myself.
5142825	5144727	But it's kind of interesting.
5145047	5148550	It's a standby telephone-based way of verifying you.
5148890	5152073	Again, you only have to use it when it detects suspicious activity.
5152573	5156316	Then, I guess, basically that the logins are coming from a foreign country.
5157757	5162247	So kind of interesting that they've put that as a solution as well.
5163035	5163776	Yars Revenge is on its way.
5191258	5195799	Also, by the way, Asteroid, Star Raiders, and Centipede are all supposed to be getting remakes within the next year.
5195839	5197399	Those are already previously announced.
5198499	5199500	Didn't they do that stuff?
5199520	5202340	I know they've done Asteroid remakes, and they haven't been that good.
5205141	5206901	Some of the remakes are really hit and miss.
5207401	5212542	I think back, though, remember when they redid Pong on the PlayStation 1?
5212822	5215763	That was actually kind of a cool game, at least back in the PS1 game.
5215823	5218023	And I guess Tempest 2000 or whatever was supposed to be...
5218383	5220325	As far as recent remakes, though, I don't know.
5220365	5222747	I didn't play the Haunted House one, but I have zero interest in it.
5222787	5225109	But if the Ars Revenge one's any good, I'll check it out.
5225470	5225810	Why not?
5226691	5229293	Anyhow, one other news story for you guys.
5230194	5234057	This is about a game that has come out of RPG Maker 2003.
5235699	5237600	It's called Marvel Brothel.
5238041	5239983	Yes, it is a sex RPG...
5242688	5243869	Magneto says to stop it.
5243889	5245791	This is a retarded and stupid idea.
5245811	5248613	Do you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad?
5274326	5275127	DarkSakura
5293755	5300603	Well, in other news, for those of us who are mobile phone gamers, Splatterhouse is coming out.
5301304	5302385	Splatterhouse is cool.
5304287	5309133	Namco is going to be doing a release of Splatterhouse on November 23rd.
5309974	5312076	And, yeah, Splatterhouse.
5313218	5318545	We also have Angry Birds, which is a game that I just heard of and downloaded yesterday.
5319826	5322169	Because my husband's aunt is addicted to it.
5323231	5326515	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and WiiWare.
5326995	5328217	And there's going to be a sequel.
5328237	5329277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5352483	5353503	It's better than fart apps.
5353783	5362185	Someone on the BART train that I rode up here was playing Three Angry Birds right next to me and I just wanted to smack it out of his hand.
5362225	5363046	Why all the hate?
5363706	5370447	I played it on the iPad when you got your iPhone 4 and I got to the third level and I don't get it.
5370948	5371808	It's kind of stupid.
5372108	5373028	I didn't like it.
5373148	5375889	Well, now you can play it on Xbox Live Arcade or not or you can make fun of it there.
5376169	5376369	Yes.
5376649	5377229	There you go.
5378029	5379350	But you won't be using your fingers to do it.
5380650	5380790	No.
5380810	5380870	No.
5381092	5381232	No.
5382553	5384354	Anything else, DarkSakura, before we get to Twitter topics?
5384575	5384915	Yes.
5385415	5386876	Rock band releases.
5387217	5388718	Ooh.
5388918	5391300	The Bee Gees.
5393141	5394242	The Bee Gees are awesome.
5394662	5395202	Yeah.
5395383	5396123	Look at that hair.
5397464	5405390	Actually, that particular image is the same image that was used on the back cover of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.
5405450	5406531	And you know how I know this?
5407191	5409013	I had two versions of it on vinyl.
5409433	5410554	A double LP version.
5410914	5412936	The guy in the middle looks kind of like Jesus.
5413396	5414117	You can't deny that.
5414217	5415958	I'm going to post this in the chat room.
5415978	5416839	He's Disco Jesus.
5416859	5417960	Yeah, he's Disco Jesus.
5421163	5423825	But you know, I actually do like the Bee Gees.
5424225	5433293	But anyway, there's going to be A Whiter Shade of Pale by Procol Harum and The Thrill is Gone, B.B.
5433333	5433593	King.
5433653	5434293	That's always cool.
5435294	5441458	The Bee Gees Pack is going to have Jive Talkin', Night Fever, Stayin' Alive, Nights on Broadway, Tragedy, and You Should Be Dancing.
5442058	5445700	The first three and the last one were all on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.
5446621	5450583	You should be dancing, yeah.
5450623	5456747	Tragedy is the name of a heavy metal Bee Gees cover band.
5458588	5461449	Because I've played some of them on the show before.
5461909	5462170	Wow.
5464938	5477089	and there's also a couple of them which is Stayin' Alive and The Thrill Is Gone have pro guitar bass expansions for 80 Microsoft points.
5477229	5480552	You gotta have the Stayin' Alive with the pro expansions.
5480772	5481072	Awesome.
5483374	5489860	I remember this picture very vividly because, like I said, I grew up with both copies of this album and played them until they skipped.
5490441	5491001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5503360	5508824	Stayin' Alive Headbands and short shorts Headbands and leg warmers Roller skates
5524597	5525738	tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
5547441	5550523	I guess DarkSakura's just going to have to sing it tonight.
5551444	5553306	Didn't this happen last week with Twitter music?
5553446	5553866	Oh, there it is.
5554246	5554586	There it is.
5555207	5555607	We're saved.
5557309	5560571	Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.
5560671	5563773	Going on to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
5564974	5568377	Let's get into a tweet here from PotCulture who's going to start us off tonight.
5569098	5575843	Don't know if you guys discussed it before, but I just found an Android and iOS mobile MMO game called Pocket Legends.
5576383	5578304	Game Center Game Center Game Center Game Center
5602422	5606968	Not something I'd play long term but for a free diversion when you're sitting on the toilet.
5607709	5608130	Good times.
5609307	5610949	You totally reminded me of a shirt I want to get.
5611169	5611509	What's that?
5611769	5613891	It says, iPhone changed the way I use the bathroom.
5614011	5615973	There you go.
5616073	5618074	Moving on to Actdeft sends us a tweet.
5618435	5623639	Sly 4 is being teased in the Sly collection for the PS3.
5624219	5630685	I guess there's actually a little teaser trailer thingy on the PS3 that is teasing a new Sly game.
5631365	5636950	But I mean, if there were three others and they've all been doing well, the Necessitated collection, is this really a surprise to anybody?
5638479	5640800	But it's nice to have it somewhat officially confirmed.
5642100	5643341	Redertainment says this is a tweet.
5643721	5644321	Boxy!
5644881	5649402	Overpriced oddly shaped box or over fucking priced oddly shaped piece of shit.
5649523	5651443	I've never heard... What is... Boxy?
5651583	5652103	What is that?
5652984	5653824	Does anyone know what that is?
5655549	5657850	I think it's a streaming device
5679940	5680061	It's $199.
5680161	5683444	The price is Apple TV.
5685226	5687008	Isn't Apple TV only $99 now?
5687388	5687608	Really?
5688269	5690932	Actually, Boxee puts a little comparison right there.
5690972	5693694	They're saying there's more than there is to iTunes.
5694175	5698019	There's twice the HD and Boxee plays more file formats.
5699520	5704183	Don't the new TiVos have a lot of internet integration in it now?
5704363	5707165	If you want Hulu Plus, you can get it on TiVo, I think.
5707225	5708126	I have a way around that.
5708646	5710268	I have a computer hooked up to my television.
5711288	5716992	I would say, honestly, before you spend the money on this, I mean, I guess if you really want something like this, yay.
5717293	5722036	But if you already have a PlayStation or Xbox 360, look into the streaming alternatives you have on there.
5722498	5729745	or spend like $300 on a cheap-ass laptop and use that and then you can actually take the cheap-ass laptop with you.
5730906	5732907	Or you can build yourself a micro for like, what, $200?
5733688	5734989	I guess it depends on your budget, sir.
5736951	5739573	Our computer that we have in the front room was leftovers.
5740574	5745719	And now it's our internet computer for the front room so that Dan can watch Top Gear.
5746198	5753866	You can get a PC that can stream stuff off the internet or play stuff for under $100.
5754626	5757489	Our buddy SSJ100Matt is sending us a pair of tweets here.
5757529	5758590	I'll read these real quickly.
5758691	5760773	One of them has to do with Gal Gun.
5761654	5769722	I guess Gal Gun is having a fight with Microsoft over panties because apparently the official Gal Gun site is down.
5770782	5777145	I guess Gal Gun was supposed to be out on January 27th, but they're having some problems with Microsoft.
5777165	5780586	There's negotiations over the moral issues about the game.
5781126	5784187	Microsoft is objecting to the content in the shooter.
5787515	5790456	I don't think this is a game that's ever going to come out over here anyway, just because of what it is.
5790536	5791196	So, enjoy.
5805802	5806422	and DarkSakura.com.
5829578	5832701	Unless you're a PlayStation Plus member, then it's free.
5833182	5838226	But apparently it's very similar to MLB TV, which also came out earlier on the PS3 this year.
5838787	5844753	And if you subscribe to Game Center Live, which is $169 annually, you get all of these features.
5845093	5849257	You stream live out-of-market games, select playoff broadcasts,
5849977	5870835	But what's cool is that it looks like the scoreboard kind of comes up live on your TV And you can kind of use the controllers to switch events and stuff Kind of looks like a neat way to watch live sporting events I like this whole like interactive stuff Kind of cool So yeah, maybe I don't watch every sports game that's out there But I think this kind of technology is neat It's going to change the way we watch television forever
5873174	5874414	TheSag is sending us a tweet.
5874434	5883017	You might remember he was here a few weeks ago and he was talking about Umlaut and he wanted us to mention that now they've got a Pac-Man eBay auction that's going on at Umlaut.
5883797	5884878	Y'all a fan of Pac-Man?
5885438	5886158	Well, here's the deal.
5886218	5888779	They're actually going to be auctioning off at Umlaut.
5889199	5889979	Actually, no, I'm sorry.
5890019	5891620	It's going to be on eBay right now.
5892020	5893902	Pac-Man for the Famicom
5915566	5916507	So, very cool.
5916547	5917627	Currently going for how much?
5918468	5922411	Right now it's up to $565, but it's autographed by the creator of Pac-Man.
5922491	5923331	That's pretty awesome.
5924372	5928455	More information available at umlaut.org That's just in a couple weeks.
5928495	5929796	I can't believe it's right around the corner.
5929816	5930296	Can you believe it?
5931317	5931837	Crazy stuff.
5932938	5933458	Let's see.
5933778	5935039	Also on the tweets.
5937560	5940382	Going to DarkTetsuya.
5940882	5943604	As if Naked Dance Central weren't enough, someone did this.
5943664	5945485	I'm almost afraid to click this link here.
5945565	5946125	Good God.
5946145	5947906	It's probably the IGN Naked story.
5948951	5950091	No, it's the nuts.
5950852	5954153	Not safe for work, two naked girls playing Kinect.
5954633	5955653	It's topless.
5955713	5957234	Oh, then I want to see this.
5957294	5958354	Let's see.
5958454	5959715	June 26th, 19... 32!
5965617	5966817	Sponsor message?
5966857	5967937	What's this bullshit?
5969038	5969458	Shut up!
5970831	5971071	Here we go.
5971091	5972173	Oh yes, I see boobies.
5985023	5989805	Is it sad that I recognize which song they were playing and not which difficulty in Dance Central?
5990605	5992246	You can tell who's fake and who's not.
5992466	5993446	Actually, I think they're both fake.
5993867	5994367	They're both fake.
5994707	5996048	This makes for great radio.
5996448	5999769	We're looking at two topless chicks in studio right now.
6000389	6002710	They're playing Lady Gaga on Easy.
6003471	6004931	Oh, God, they are, aren't they?
6005251	6006752	Yeah.
6006852	6008152	That is sad that you recognize that.
6008252	6008893	It is very sad.
6010686	6011747	I think she has nice boobies.
6012287	6012927	But they're fake.
6012947	6013688	They don't move right.
6015389	6016449	What do you think, Alan?
6016489	6017930	Do you like the boobies?
6020212	6021492	He's refusing to comment.
6023414	6027576	If OLR and Howard Stern were to ever overlap, this is as far as it gets.
6028236	6030978	Except he would have them in studio doing it in front of him.
6031498	6032359	Well, we're low budget.
6034931	6036692	I like this link from Tigerclaw.
6036752	6038873	Sends us this link to a story here.
6039413	6042934	Reggie is wondering where the Metroid Other M sales went wrong.
6044515	6045135	Here's a quote.
6045275	6046155	Chew on this for a minute.
6046375	6047296	From Reggie Fils-Aimé.
6047736	6051037	We believe that it could be, should be, a million unit title.
6051397	6053640	We're not going to get there, not through the holiday.
6054060	6057144	And we are doing a lot of thinking as to why, because it's a great game.
6057485	6060268	The consumer reaction because of the quality has been strong.
6060549	6065415	I think the marketing was strong, advertising was very good, the social media we did was very positive.
6066616	6067858	Yeah, and the story is crap.
6068919	6069440	Why is that?
6071559	6076322	So it kind of just sounds like they just, like, IDK, LOL.
6076382	6078363	Like, they're like, it's a good game.
6078423	6080445	They don't get at all why it didn't.
6080545	6082566	People actually care about the characterization.
6083247	6083487	Yeah.
6084247	6089471	I honestly think it more has to do with the fact that people are kind of, like, the hardcore gamers are kind of over the Wii.
6089931	6095174	Like, I get that this was a game to kind of throw a bone at the hardcore gamers, but I think it was kind of too late.
6095194	6096695	They've moved on a while ago.
6096715	6099097	I think there's a lot of people like me who have put their Wii in a box.
6100999	6101740	We in a box.
6102181	6103523	It's my we in a box.
6105686	6105927	We're 12.
6106247	6107549	Should I bring out the boobie video again?
6107849	6108090	All right.
6108711	6111475	I think you got a few more messages.
6111555	6111976	Hold on.
6111996	6114860	I got another one here from another one from Tiger Claw.
6116956	6119859	See, you know what's funny is that Tigerclaw actually sent us like five tweets.
6120279	6120859	No, wait, four.
6121200	6123962	But what happened is that the other two were stories we covered a minute ago.
6124022	6125623	So he was like, oh, I know they're not going to read those.
6125883	6126804	So I'm going to send new tweets.
6127925	6131067	Tigerclaw is working the Twitters.
6131527	6132888	He has the system down.
6133709	6134329	But I'll allow it.
6135190	6137751	Anyhow, let's see, Tiger Claw also sends us this.
6138192	6140833	Oh, the WE patent infringement investigation.
6140853	6148718	The International Trade Commission is going to be moving forward looking at this, that the WE system is actually infringing on patents held by Motiva.
6149018	6150079	Have you never heard of them?
6150099	6150659	They're in Ohio.
6151099	6155702	Well, anyhow, they're going to complete their investigation by March 5th, 2012.
6155782	6159444	There will be an initial determination on the matter by November 4th, 2011.
6161265	6164268	Yeah, by that time, I'm sure the new Wii will be announced.
6164788	6164268	2012.
6164868	6165689	Well, we'll see.
6165749	6166109	I don't know.
6166129	6166509	Maybe not.
6167050	6168130	It'll be called the what?
6168511	6168951	The what?
6169531	6170052	The what?
6171093	6171633	So there you go.
6172213	6182521	And by the way, just for historical purposes, Nintendo did win an appeal of a 2008 decision where they were supposed to pay $21 million to Anescape over the WaveBird wireless controller.
6183041	6185443	So Nintendo has a good track record on these cases.
6185843	6186284	We'll see.
6187967	6190670	Oh, it looks like ShermieOLR has been tweeting us here.
6190770	6193412	ShermieOLR sent us a tweet that says Rob's feet smell funny.
6193492	6194033	Thanks for that.
6194173	6195735	I appreciate that, DarkSakura.
6195895	6196575	Tell Shermie.
6196675	6199979	She's the one who sent it telepathically to my brain that made it up.
6200079	6200879	Whatever.
6201480	6202000	Whatever.
6202801	6205884	She's got to sit there and smell your feet all during the show.
6205904	6206605	Trick or treat.
6206645	6207406	Smell my feet.
6207526	6209127	She's a very patient little girl.
6209548	6209848	Alright.
6213493	6217437	I don't know if we are still streaming because our Winamp is frozen here on our side.
6218438	6221080	So we're going to just ride it out and see what happens.
6221921	6224263	We're going to keep taping for podcasts, so let's keep moving.
6226205	6227346	We'll get into some more gaming news.
6227366	6228467	That's it for the Twitters tonight.
6229387	6229928	Thank you guys.
6231609	6232590	Are we disconnected right now?
6233731	6237435	Okay, I will... Okay, I'll reconnect us, guys.
6237915	6239536	Alright, got it.
6239596	6240497	Live radio happens.
6240537	6241198	Let's keep moving.
6241438	6242539	Just get into the next story.
6242559	6243320	I'll restart the stream.
6244161	6245622	Okay.
6245982	6246483	Let's see.
6246623	6248865	Well, this is kind of interesting.
6249105	6252828	Well, not too surprising, but Black Ops sold a lot, I guess.
6253008	6253229	Uh-huh.
6255370	6260073	They are now calling it the largest entertainment launch in history.
6260514	6266898	It sold 5.6 million units in the US and the UK and grossed $360 million in sales for the first 24 hours.
6271981	6295008	and apparently you want to compare that to last year's where it was 4.7 million units during the launch for Modern Warfare 2 so quite an increase from last year and of course to go along with that Activision is saying that Call of Duty's download content will be the largest digital offering ever
6296818	6300239	Alright, sorry to interrupt, but thanks to the live drama going on.
6300320	6301300	Okay, so here's what happened.
6301500	6303141	Our show went down for whatever reason.
6303161	6305262	We had an internet clog or whatever.
6305782	6309503	So we all get kicked from the chat room and then we all rejoin it while our ghosts are in there.
6309543	6314025	We've just been banned from the chat network, but at least our feed's back up and running.
6314285	6315486	But unfortunately, we're not in chat.
6315726	6316948	I'll hop in chat in an hour.
6317108	6319772	I can get you on IRC real quick if you want to switch places.
6332085	6332706	What do you think?
6333386	6335608	Why do you think this game is doing so phenomenally well?
6336569	6338451	Actually, this is what I wanted to chew on a little bit here.
6338851	6344156	Wasn't there supposed to be this whole backlash because of the Infinity Ward stuff that happened, which I think everyone had agreed was kind of fucked up?
6345617	6350561	Wasn't there supposed to be this huge backlash against the game that didn't really end up happening, or what?
6352563	6357427	Yeah, probably pretty similar to the backlash that was supposed to happen with...
6360448	6361850	Left 4 Dead 2, remember?
6364034	6364394	I don't know.
6365656	6369041	Why do you think games like these are doing extremely well?
6369101	6374390	What is it about this genre of video game that really attracts people, you think?
6377260	6382262	People like their first-person shooters, and especially something that has such a strong online component to it.
6384063	6390986	That's why they're all over games like Halo Reach and Modern Warfare 2 and, of course, Black Ops and whatnot.
6391866	6398809	Especially more realistic shooters that have real military weapons in them and stuff.
6399889	6401250	It's the perfect storm, I guess.
6402191	6423430	but it's funny though because even though it's a Treyarch game usually it's like oh Treyarch Call of Duty but yet they still buy it and lots of it is it just the name that's attached to it or what's the deal I think franchise definitely helps but yeah it's just funny interesting
6428952	6433856	It's gamesurge.net Sorry, we're trying to work on technical difficulties here.
6433956	6438038	irc.gamesurge.net But that is the IRC network we're on.
6438058	6447244	If you want to join us, if you don't for whatever reason want to connect to our website at chat.orangeonestradio.com You could be uncool and not go in our chat room.
6447765	6448085	I know.
6449198	6450718	All the cool kids are there except us.
6452099	6455280	Well, how about something else in news?
6455620	6455880	Sure.
6456200	6460421	Rob, I think this might make you roll your eyes and go, what?
6460582	6460862	Okay.
6462102	6465943	UK retailers are deciding that they don't like Steam.
6466543	6471585	They actually are going to try to boycott Steam effectively.
6473365	6477947	One of them is quoted as saying, if we have a digital service and I don't want to start selling...
6479087	6480808	and a rival in store.
6481188	6492734	So basically they're saying that not only are you competing with your product in the store, but you've got rivals in there as well that could be taking your market and you can do a side-by-side comparison for price.
6493514	6495595	Took them long enough to realize this, by the way.
6495755	6496035	Yeah.
6496476	6501578	Well, and that's the same thing that was going on with Apple and now it's going to be going on with Steam.
6502058	6505360	Although, honestly, from a consumer point of view, I love Steam.
6506750	6508711	I do too because of all the sales they always do on there.
6508751	6509792	It's great.
6510853	6514215	And pre-orders and getting to play Join Trill.
6514435	6516597	I mean, I didn't say that, did I?
6516897	6517878	Hey, I'm back in chat.
6517898	6518218	Hooray.
6518298	6519599	Thank you, Alan, for hooking that up.
6519639	6520819	Chat.OrangeHunter.com.
6520940	6523461	Actdeft says, UK retailers equals stupid.
6523581	6524442	So damn stupid.
6527444	6556253	I don't know though I mean if I were a retailer and you know I'm practically selling this program that is going to install a store that makes it easier to take sales away from me I don't know I think they have a right to not sell it I mean it's a tricky line to balance though it's up to them but honestly I mean they're going between the easy sale and market profit whatever to the what's going to be better for them in the long term and I don't even know that that's still going to be good for them in the long term
6557112	6560935	GameGuru in our chatroom says, so they aren't going to sell Civ V and Call of Duty?
6561275	6562056	That's a good point.
6562456	6568121	I mean, such huge releases included, it's hard to not have it, you know what I mean?
6568481	6572864	And honestly, I think that Steam would facilitate more sales, at least in those big titles.
6573265	6579510	But I can see smaller developers maybe... Well, honestly, though, it's still a friend of smaller developers, too, because they come up as budget games.
6580330	6581211	So, I'm just saying.
6582105	6582445	All right.
6583406	6588749	Well, anyhow, let me talk about a new sales model that's out there from THQ.
6589269	6592871	Apparently, they've decided that $39.99 is the place to be.
6593331	6598454	Hey, this doesn't sound so bad, although careful, there might be kind of a but here.
6599054	6599955	Here's the deal.
6600015	6605177	This is a quote from the Capital Markets Conference from THQ President Brian Farrell.
6605657	6605917	Quote,
6623846	6638112	so the thinking at this time is let's initially launch at $39.99 it's a AAA title at that price point but then with a series of DLC so people can extend their experience hmm isn't THQ also one of those companies that does the $10 online thing?
6639972	6646055	yes but doesn't that seem to sting a lot less when they're only charging $40 for the game to begin with?
6647335	6651217	well $10 online is only if you buy the game used true true
6653208	6657371	Well, I mean, I'm liking this idea of the fact that maybe the game will only cost $40, you know?
6660494	6661835	It's a nice idea.
6662615	6672763	We've heard a lot about this kind of stuff, though, is that games tend to sell, I mean, this is kind of a duh, but some games, I should say, have really sold better after a price reduction, right?
6673243	6673503	Yeah.
6673683	6675164	Like DJ Hero was an example.
6675205	6681109	We had the first DJ Hero game, didn't sell too hot for a few, but then they cut the price and it sells a lot.
6682717	6685199	Interesting, huh?
6686660	6694266	That could be interesting if it starts this new trend, although, I don't know, they have to make back their money, but I think the guy makes a good point.
6694366	6699970	If you have more users, even if it's a lower price, you still end up making the same amount of money, right?
6700971	6701791	Maybe even more.
6702512	6706375	Well, and they're saying more opportunity for DLC, because if you have...
6707195	6713599	2 users are willing to buy the game for $39.99 versus 1 person that wants to buy it for $59.99 then you have the opportunity to sell 2 $10 DLCs or multiple $10 DLCs
6725025	6725446	Good point.
6725526	6734511	Ooh, Robert M has a really good comment in our chatroom at chat.orange.com Would the original Katamari have been as successful at more than $20?
6735672	6736152	Good point.
6736172	6741396	That's what really drove sales of that first game was the fact that it was a $20 game and everybody was like, you've got to get this Katamari game.
6741436	6741876	It's only $20.
6742196	6742797	It's awesome.
6743177	6748060	But if it had been a $50 game or whatever they were charging at the time, would it have been as exciting?
6748680	6749461	I don't know.
6751242	6751382	Hmm.
6752714	6754476	So anyhow, Loki, what do you have for us?
6755416	6755797	Ah, yes.
6757258	6761902	So there's more fun stuff we can talk about, and this is more THQ-related things.
6763923	6772591	I don't know if I should be excited or disappointed that they're planning on doing this, but Saints Row apparently is going to become a movie, according to THQ.
6772631	6779556	They're going to be announcing it next month, although they've just announced it, I don't know, I guess officially announced it.
6779576	6781438	So they've announced that an announcement is coming.
6782075	6809250	um yes and so apparently I guess they're gonna have uh some sort of movie um coming out I think it's gonna be kind of cool cause you know Saints Row unlike Grand Theft Auto it does have like a single storyline that goes along um whereas Grand Theft Auto is kind of all over the place so it could work perhaps I definitely think that they should get the people that did the voice acting for the game you know kind of in there so uh
6810750	6811951	That would be kind of cool.
6812731	6813571	I'd probably go see it.
6814751	6817032	What would you want to see most in a Saints Row movie?
6817392	6818212	How about a good plot?
6818352	6818852	A musical.
6819553	6821493	A good plot would be nice.
6822113	6822533	Nudity.
6824474	6826174	Nudity would be fine.
6826455	6830736	Random glitches.
6832916	6833977	It could be interesting.
6834057	6834377	I don't know.
6834397	6838978	I would like to see just some of the main characters that they have in the game make a return.
6841536	6841696	We too.
6857874	6861937	and how it really isn't necessarily going to happen in 2011.
6862437	6869322	But is that just because they really aren't going to announce one in 2011 or because they just don't want to cannibalize sales here in 2010?
6870263	6879789	And there was a bit of talk with Reggie Fils-Aimé and let me read you some of the quotes here because Kotaku actually kind of asked Reggie about this and said, "'We Too' is not a must for next holiday?"
6880129	6881270	And he said, "'No.'"
6881790	6886574	But you sort of expect that that answer's coming because when you announce the "'We Too' then people are going to stop buying the Wii.'"
6888596	6892700	Reggie did say, by the way, that the Wii's sales have peaked in the system's third year.
6893021	6895543	There are more than 30 million Wiis out there right now.
6895924	6903872	He also has these charts and things that show that the Wii is selling now faster than the PlayStation 2 was at the same point in time.
6904673	6906916	23% faster, if you want to be exact.
6907496	6907657	Hmm.
6908257	6913982	So anyhow, the Wii 2 might come in Christmas 2011, but it's all speculation right now.
6914602	6918185	Of course, Nintendo's really going to be behind the 3DS next year, we know that.
6918726	6925571	One interesting other note that Reggie did leave the interview on, as we sit here today, we're saying the Wii has many, many more units to sell.
6926191	6932637	After we've reached an install base of 45 million units in the US, then we can have a conversation about the next generation.
6933197	6933537	Hmm.
6934438	6936360	I guess we can see kind of where their goals are at.
6936920	6938022	But I don't know, what do you guys think?
6938062	6939726	Do they need to announce a Wii 2 next year?
6940066	6941048	It prints money!
6942932	6944395	They don't need a new Wii Lease.
6945377	6945857	Wii Rease.
6947060	6949104	They need a system that's better.
6951594	6957078	I think this is funny because to me, this and the whole why isn't Metroid selling thing go hand in hand to me.
6959180	6964084	And I think the next Wii, one thing Nintendo does pretty well these days is the backwards compatibility thing.
6964384	6966065	The next Wii will be like a Super Wii.
6966125	6968907	It's going to be a Wii that runs on HD and it uses all the same stuff.
6969108	6969608	You know what?
6969708	6971249	No, this is my thing.
6971329	6977254	With that comment and everything, the why isn't this selling, it's not really that he's being that dumb.
6978695	6982478	It's trying to talk it up so that people will go out and buy it.
6983219	6991846	I mean, it's just more, we believe in our product, we stand behind it, even though they may be sitting in a boardroom going, what the hell were they thinking when they wrote the story for this game?
6991926	6995449	How can you people be so stupid to not buy this amazing video game?
6995729	6996270	Exactly.
6996823	7005230	Going to our chat at chat.orangeslaunchradio.com Casey says, so now they're treating their home consoles like they're handhelds with the replacing them with a new version of the same thing.
7005870	7013036	Well, there was all that talk that the Wii was just a souped up GameCube, but at the same time, the Wii is the most successful console ever.
7013953	7014674	Per sales.
7014994	7022079	I mean, as much as we sit here and give it a hard time, and as much as you might roll your eyes at games like Metroid Other M, money is what money is.
7023380	7023800	Let's see.
7024841	7032287	Also, saying this, GameGuru in our chat room says, they want 3DS to have this Christmas and save Wii 2 for 2012.
7033668	7036149	I think 3DS for this Christmas, meaning really Christmas 2011.
7036310	7038651	And that could very well be the case.
7038871	7041233	I think the 3DS will really be where it's at next year.
7042054	7042954	And it'll print money!
7044170	7045091	Right, Salacious Pulp?
7045211	7045892	It'll print money.
7045932	7046172	Yes.
7046572	7046813	All right.
7047713	7048874	Let's go to the email bag.
7048955	7053038	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is where you send your emails every week.
7053819	7058603	DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag headfirst and pull out some of her favorite emails and read them for you right now.
7059164	7068072	One of them, I'm not going to read the email, but in regards to the contest to get the code for Symphony of the Night for Xbox Live Arcade,
7069253	7073335	I said specifically not Orange Lounge Radio.
7074075	7078857	Who is it that is He Who Shall Not Be Named on Comic Insanity?
7078997	7082418	It's called Cross Promotion.
7083198	7086880	As in you kind of got to go listen to both podcasts if you're going to win.
7088000	7088820	So, no.
7088940	7089741	Yes, ma'am.
7089761	7092822	You're automatically disqualified for not following the rules.
7094122	7094443	I don't know.
7094483	7095383	I might give you another chance.
7098451	7108277	I heard the story about GameStop that had the Call of Duty Black Ops I shop at that store, but the story confuses me
7110743	7114625	Why would this particular robbery about my little town make all of the game blogs?
7115045	7117887	The only thing I can think of is that it promotes Call of Duty.
7118528	7123150	So the story, by making the rounds, is inadvertently condoning the robbery for the sake of advertisement.
7123871	7127513	The store is actually pretty nice and in a nice area.
7127613	7128754	It's odd that it was robbed.
7129194	7134938	The highways allow for a very quick trip to I-95 and probably made it to the street vendors in New York City and D.C.
7134978	7135858	by Sunday.
7136178	7136899	Later, RobbaBuh.
7137341	7139203	I can actually think of a lot of answers to the questions.
7139283	7141525	Why was it so important?
7141885	7152514	Well, it probably wasn't in the scope of things, but think about it made the news for the same reason that all these murders that involve fights over Xbox controllers and stuff make news.
7152614	7156037	I mean, it just kind of remotely has to do with video games and so people talk about it.
7157118	7163244	Also, it was probably all over the place because you said it happened in a place you didn't expect it to happen.
7163804	7176920	and when these sorts of things happens in places where you know you kind of go wow really it happens there people setting fire people talk in the back of a GameStop slash Macy's exactly in Roseville and you can still see the broken roof
7177549	7182630	And because that was like a super nice mall, if that had happened at Floor and Mall, it would have been just like, oh, Sunday.
7184131	7184651	Seriously.
7185351	7190112	But, well, I mean, I worked at GNC and got held up at gunpoint.
7190772	7193413	This guy was going around and hitting GNCs.
7194153	7194513	Random.
7194994	7197014	It was my first job when I moved out here.
7197294	7197514	Uh-huh.
7198194	7200955	So, I was like, dude, you suck.
7201055	7203096	Those giant tubs of Bolt Gainer 4000 are like 60 bucks a...
7204952	7210436	Well, on top of that, the moron came after I had done a deposit in the safe.
7211517	7214859	And, yeah, I could get into the safe, but I just said, dude, we've got a safe, I can't get into it.
7215659	7216420	It's on time lock.
7217040	7218782	I can't get in, yeah.
7218962	7223785	When I'm in panic mode, I either will go completely crazy or completely calm.
7224185	7227527	And I went completely calm, and so I could write down the make of his gun, what he looked like.
7227608	7228888	I drew the guy for the cops.
7228908	7229469	It was kind of fun.
7229709	7230209	That's awesome.
7230269	7230710	And they caught him.
7232031	7232511	Good times.
7232731	7234692	Like, what idiot robs a GNC?
7234752	7237712	It's the same thing as what idiot robs a GameStop in a nice area.
7239393	7239653	Anyway.
7239693	7241733	What idiot burns down a GameStop in a nice mall?
7242094	7244174	Oh, this guy was on the drugs.
7244754	7250236	Well, and every news station in the entirety of Northern California and CNN, probably.
7250336	7255117	This one person on his Facebook, his friend of his says, dude, you were stupid on his Facebook.
7255137	7260539	There's a guy that I was sitting next to in my magazine thing, went to high school with him.
7260859	7261399	Oh, how random.
7261419	7261639	Yeah.
7263100	7263921	Okay, next one.
7264441	7277333	Just to ask an actually intelligent question for a change, with the latest incarnations of these games reasonably recently published, what do you think was the most influential for defining the console first-person genre, Halo or Goldeneye?
7278054	7283419	Or, as the giant bomb guys were discussing, Call of Duty 4 for its multiplayer structure, or none of the above?
7283859	7288003	Thanks as always, Robert M. I'm going to say Goldeneye right off the bat, and Goldeneye did have multiplayer.
7290623	7291264	Slow down for me.
7291924	7295886	The question is, console first-person shooter the most impactful on consoles?
7296286	7300508	What was more influential for defining the console first-person genre?
7301408	7303309	Halo or Goldeneye or Call of Duty 4?
7304628	7331046	I would say Halo 2 because of online Xbox Live and I think that really set the stage for everything after it was Xbox Live not the original Halo didn't have Xbox Live but Halo 2 I think was Xbox Live I still say Duke Nukem 3D but then when I go influential first person shooters honestly I go back to PC games because my mind says but but but but but
7331506	7336850	Quake and Half-Life and Doom and Wolfenstein 3D really.
7337030	7339912	Quake 3 was out on Dreamcast with internet play.
7340812	7341433	Huh, interesting.
7341993	7346116	Still though, not quite the impact I think of a Halo 2 on Xbox Live.
7346216	7349838	But Halo was by no means the first.
7350539	7351139	No, oh no.
7351259	7353961	I'm sorry, Wolfenstein 3D was on Super Nintendo.
7354657	7358439	But in the US, the Satellaview thing never went through.
7359299	7363301	But I'm going for talking about online play on a console.
7364362	7371605	And I don't really think there were first-person shooters like that that played through the Satellaview or through the Genesis Link.
7373266	7378028	But for Dreamcast, Quake 3 was like the big modem game that you played.
7379542	7406043	PSO didn't work on the US one most first person shooters that ended up on console were usually ports that came from the PC first sold a couple million copies and then okay now there's a console version where they tweak the controls GoldenEye is the first one that was relevant for consoles where it was a console exclusive and because we've gone into the whole fight before about how I only play first person shooters on
7406463	7408404	A PC because I need a keyboard and mouse.
7408864	7411745	When Goldeneye came out, I was like, okay, this is on console.
7411865	7415086	I'm going to sit and figure out how to play this game because it's awesome.
7415666	7421248	So I think Goldeneye is really the first one that made console first-person shooters stand out.
7422468	7426029	I gotta give this one a shout out though, even though the game was kind of crap.
7426789	7430050	It was a really early type of first person game called Faceball 2000.
7430090	7431530	Does anyone remember this one?
7431550	7432410	Yes, I remember Faceball 2000.
7432470	7435571	It was a Game Boy game, I believe, and they had it on Super Nintendo.
7435931	7439232	And it was the whole like, it was a very rudimentary shooter game.
7440492	7450494	I only throw that out there not because necessarily it was a great game, but because it was kind of the first type of maze shoot your opponents type of thing that was only on consoles.
7452253	7452833	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7466545	7476276	Oh, and one more first person type of game, even though it was a multiplayer, Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo in all its surround sound glory because those first person shooter phases scared the crap out of me.
7476396	7479500	What if Velociraptor would run up behind you in all his pixelated open mouth glory?
7482023	7482964	I love that voice.
7483244	7484005	You sound like Chewbacca.
7487689	7488149	So there you go.
7488369	7491370	There's a variety of first-person shooter games for you.
7491410	7493531	I think all of those have had impact in different ways.
7494691	7495471	Was that it for emails?
7496092	7496292	No.
7496652	7496752	Oh.
7497612	7498172	Well, then what's next?
7498192	7499753	Jeez, Rob, just assuming, huh?
7499993	7500253	Well.
7500473	7501974	Ignoring our poor listeners.
7502154	7502554	Well.
7503654	7504594	Dear OLR.
7505575	7506435	Dear listener.
7507051	7515276	I was listening to episode 388, and while listening to your discussion of the recently announced delay of Chinese democracy, I was mortified by the derision I heard.
7515676	7525703	Sure, Chinese democracy was supposed to be a PS3 launch game, and sure, Chinese democracy is toted as the best racing game of all time, but how does any of that change with another delay?
7525963	7527003	Oh, I see what you're doing.
7527043	7527264	Yes.
7528064	7532147	Chinese democracy is like a girlfriend you have that unexpectedly moves to India.
7533047	7534028	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7552580	7555781	I will go one step further when Chinese Democracy is released this year.
7556241	7557961	Not if, but when.
7558481	7562822	I will buy each and every person in the All Games community a bottle of Dr. Pepper.
7563002	7563442	Nasty.
7564642	7565643	Hey, I like Dr. Pepper.
7565983	7566523	You're welcome to it.
7567023	7570144	I am that confident in Chinese Democracy coming out this year.
7570244	7571364	Stay black, Redertainment.
7572044	7572584	There's a note.
7572984	7576865	Offer valid only to residents of the continuous... I think it means continental...
7577305	7580231	United States, and contingent on Loki wearing the Tingle costume.
7581594	7581815	Oops.
7582015	7583919	But he didn't say Tingle, he said Tinkle.
7584320	7584721	Tinkle.
7584981	7588108	So I don't think they were going to dress him up in yellow foil.
7588584	7590385	First off, I see what you did there.
7591345	7593365	Second off, you know what's funny?
7593486	7594746	And this is so true.
7594826	7596006	I get what you're trying to parallel.
7596066	7598667	And if you didn't pick up on it, obviously it's the Gran Turismo 5 thing, right?
7599027	7602468	But here's the funny thing that I think takes your parallel one step further.
7603108	7607510	When Chinese democracy finally came out, no one cared anymore.
7608750	7609390	Just saying.
7610151	7611611	Well, I will say this.
7613232	7614772	It is going to be this year from what I understand.
7616333	7617453	And no one cares anymore.
7617941	7619823	No, actually, that's wrong.
7620503	7624166	Because Dan and his cousin were just talking about it yesterday.
7625027	7626208	Two people care anymore.
7626789	7627189	Just kidding.
7627289	7630172	And we're talking about other people asking about it.
7630252	7630852	Fine, fine, fine.
7631092	7631873	People do still care.
7632954	7635496	I don't think as many as would have cared two years ago.
7637478	7638099	But we'll see.
7638559	7640360	Sales will be where it is all at.
7641787	7647695	Now is the part of the show where we get angsty and rude and mad because, well, we can.
7663723	7676739	I'm giving a fork you to the culinary department at my school for, um... Well, I was all excited and giddy because even though they were a week past the deadline in getting me their stuff...
7678644	7684210	3 of the recipes that they gave me were not even remotely related to any of the pictures I got.
7684630	7689395	On top of that, the pictures were in 240 DPI and I needed them in at least 300 DPI so I could use them.
7689816	7692339	So now I've had to have people do stuff to the pictures for me.
7692399	7694180	Thank goodness I can delegate the stuff.
7694941	7699383	so that I can use the pictures, and I still can't use as many of the recipes as I wanted to.
7700023	7709348	So they're just going to have to deal with only having three recipes in the damn magazine because they couldn't get their crap together, and if they do this crap next year, they don't get a section.
7711068	7713449	I'm a little irritated at them.
7714030	7717751	And they also didn't give us a title for their section, so I'm going to call it Forky Culinary.
7718812	7721413	I'm probably not, but that's what I feel like.
7723203	7724108	Well, tell us how you really feel.
7724630	7725092	Uh, Loki!
7727291	7733674	Um, I guess F you to my JTAG system for being very finicky.
7733974	7737035	Because it was red-rained, actually, earlier this week, and I got it fixed.
7737635	7741257	And so I was like, ooh, yeah, I can work back on my Grand Theft Auto stuff.
7741477	7743978	And now it's doing this stupid E79 error crap.
7744538	7750841	I think that may go away, though, because that's supposed to be a firmware glitch or corrupted firmware or something.
7750921	7752862	I'm updating the firmware anyways on it, so...
7754724	7756425	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7784778	7785339	I don't have it.
7785719	7786219	I don't have it.
7786520	7788441	And I'm thinking like, okay, but it took a week.
7788501	7790222	Something's wrong in my work, I think.
7790923	7793785	Like, it wouldn't have taken a week for my coworkers to get it from me.
7793805	7803912	I think some disgruntled person, I'll say customer, came into the front door just long enough to spread the infection.
7804512	7805893	I think we're just all becoming zombies.
7806474	7809736	But like, every time my eye itches, I'm like, oh my god, his big eye.
7810417	7813499	I know, right?
7813739	7813819	Ugh.
7814909	7818550	All right, let's move on to a couple more news stories and then your phone calls where anything can happen.
7818570	7819030	Joy and Rapture.
7819631	7820671	Loki, what do you have for us?
7820691	7821991	More Rapture, though.
7845719	7846520	Super Mario Bros.
7846540	7848242	3 has actually been remade.
7848962	7853688	Funny enough, it's a mod to the new Super Mario Bros.
7853888	7856050	DS game.
7856411	7857872	They did new Super Mario Bros.
7858613	7860235	3, and it's kind of cool.
7860255	7864479	It's a completely redone game for all the Mario Bros.
7864659	7866722	3 levels, plus some additional challenge levels.
7867782	7875526	plus some actual hybrid levels with the Metroid stuff in there and all sorts of other crazy stuff.
7876427	7886972	You can download the actual mod for the ROM off of gbatemp.net and it's actually pretty awesome looking.
7887032	7890533	I'm thinking about checking it out with my... Wait, this is a ROM?
7890714	7891314	What system is this for?
7891374	7893115	It's a mod for a ROM for the DS.
7893928	7897131	I'm watching the video, it's really sweet.
7897151	7897211	Hmm.
7917924	7918445	It's pretty sweet.
7918605	7922747	Looks like they had to do a few creative liberties, but still overall very impressive.
7923667	7924047	Good for them.
7926388	7928129	How long till Nintendo sues?
7930590	7933111	At least they didn't say New Super Mario Bros.
7933391	7933111	3.
7933431	7934012	It's on LinkedIn.
7934032	7940155	So in that case, you want to get... Well, the fact that it's been on the internet longer than a day means that it'll never go away.
7941861	7942561	Everyone has it now.
7943402	7949364	Well, in a follow-up to something we were discussing just a minute ago, I think this is an appropriate last main story for tonight.
7949784	7953325	Gran Turismo 5 has a release date.
7953985	7955466	And I would like my Dr. Pepper, please.
7956346	7958867	November 24th is the day.
7959847	7963709	This is coming from Polyphony Digital's Kazunori Yamauchi.
7965630	7975176	Satisfying the loyal Gran Turismo followers is at the heart of all our efforts, which is why it was such a difficult decision to delay the release of the game, and one which we did not take lightly.
7975536	7983582	I can only apologize to everyone for making you wait so long, and I hope that when you try out the wealth of driving experiences available in Gran Turismo 5, you will not be disappointed.
7994989	7995230	Wow.
7996430	7997211	I want my Bugatti.
7998572	8001994	Can I race like my Honda Civic?
8002074	8002554	Probably.
8003535	8004996	Whatever the racing model would be.
8005176	8006437	They also have kart racing.
8007197	8007457	Nice.
8007738	8008358	And NASCAR.
8008418	8008938	But no Mario Kart.
8009159	8010580	I just want my Bugatti.
8010620	8011080	I'll be happy.
8011564	8015109	Well, they do have a track editor, Rob, so maybe you will get Mario Kart.
8016891	8020916	If there's a track editor, then it's just a matter of time before Mario Kart Circuit shows up, that's for sure.
8022378	8023159	Gran Turismo Kart!
8026485	8027045	Last Minute Stories, Loki?
8048959	8056288	Yes, and it was not even a week after the new dashboard came out and they've already ported it over to JTAG Systems for the Xbox 360.
8057028	8061153	So now, all those people with JTAGs, like myself, can play...
8062170	8063851	you know, Kinect games.
8064632	8078982	Of course, for people like me that bought a Kinect system with Kinect or a slim system with Kinect I had to order a really expensive adapter to play said thing on my old consoles.
8079142	8080363	You're so cryptic, I love it.
8081023	8083705	Let's go to El Telefonos and take some calls.
8084106	8085587	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8086593	8093637	It's the only listener with the fastest internet finger in the whole wide world, Ranma Clearly, you are the king of iron fingering What's on your mind?
8095539	8103263	Wait, I can barely hear you guys You are the king of iron fingering I try What's up?
8106605	8107426	Did he just cut out?
8107786	8108507	Ranma, are you there?
8110488	8112089	I'm right here Hi, what's on your mind?
8113191	8113291	Hello?
8113331	8113531	Hello?
8144983	8145283	Hello.
8146124	8146645	Up, he's gone.
8146905	8147185	Oh, well.
8149527	8151630	Man, he wanted to talk about pornography.
8152771	8155413	Ranma, if you can hear us, we can't hear you.
8158296	8159537	I have to hang up on him.
8159597	8159938	I'm sorry, guys.
8159958	8162640	That was so dirty, we had to bleep that out from our show.
8163141	8165343	I can't believe you and your language.
8166808	8171170	Alright, well, apparently she was only ever actually in two movies.
8171590	8174151	But, you know, it's just like the whole new Super Mario Bros.
8174171	8174931	thing hitting the internet.
8175391	8178732	Once your vajay is on the internet, always on the internet.
8179012	8180433	Just ask Paris Hilton, right?
8181673	8183514	It was just that one little homemade porn they did.
8183574	8184774	Just one!
8185454	8186755	She's a talentless hack.
8187595	8189017	and I'm talking about the porno too.
8189057	8195283	You know what's crazy is that how much money does she have now and like who was she before that porn came out?
8195403	8200448	She was an heiress to the Hilton Hotel fortune or whatever.
8200788	8202970	And no one cared until we all saw her vajay.
8203030	8204752	And she was terrible at porn.
8205633	8206634	She was not good.
8207074	8208436	I give her a thumbs down.
8211024	8212365	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8242458	8249341	So I don't know, I'm thinking, I don't know what good will come out of whoever else owns Harmonix at this point.
8249582	8255905	I mean, unless of course they go back to Activision, which is like a really, really fucked up situation.
8256285	8260047	I don't think it'll ever happen just because of battered wife syndrome they experience.
8260567	8261668	The whole Guitar Hero thing.
8262348	8269992	So I'm willing, you know, I was wondering, I guess we should propose taking bets to see who will be their next suitor.
8270714	8270754	E.A.
8297423	8300246	I've been surprised before, maybe I'll be surprised again.
8300506	8300886	Who knows?
8300926	8303188	It could be something completely fucking random, like Sega.
8303788	8305630	Yeah, you're right.
8305670	8310373	It could be them, but I'm thinking the shoe-ins are definitely, you're right, EA and then Konami.
8310774	8318119	Konami making more logical sense just because it'll pretty much rein in all the musical game talent into one house.
8318140	8318780	Yeah.
8318940	8329326	It would be interesting, but again, I think that's more of a fanboy's dream because this might be a harsh thing to say, but I'm not sure what musical talent house is left at Konami.
8329927	8332548	Poor Naoki Madea is fighting for his life over there.
8333089	8336170	And, you know, he's a great guy, really sweet, nice guy.
8336431	8339753	But Dance Masters was extremely rushed and mostly recycled.
8340393	8343055	Although I think Dance Masters 2 could be very interesting.
8343175	8346457	I don't know if they'll get the chance unless the game does really well in Japan, which it might.
8347421	8376323	well I mean on one hand you still have those old timers the ones who basically started the whole music game genre in Konami you still have most of them still you know whatever's left of them trying to see whether or not they can take you know if they make the argument that maybe they should bring harmonics on board then it'll be in safer hands because you know you have a company that has a crap ton more experience with that whole genre than EA would ever ever do in a you know in their history
8378175	8379196	I know, it is wishful
8388183	8390965	But then again, as long as EA doesn't rock the boat.
8391385	8398451	The idea is whoever buys them has to give them the autonomy, give them the light of day to operate it as an independent company in that sense.
8399912	8402413	Maybe it won't be such a terrible thing if EA buys them.
8402794	8404575	It may not be such a terrible thing if EA buys them.
8404955	8406917	EA has access to all the music.
8406957	8412421	On one hand, I wouldn't want EA to buy them just because I know it would be a lot better than Activision.
8413141	8421575	or any other company that would just drain them and make them whore them out every year for a single new release.
8421996	8423659	I think we can all agree, not Activision.
8424457	8426239	No, yeah, of course, obviously.
8426659	8430263	They're going to milk that proverbial cap, and that's pretty much what's killing that genre.
8430704	8439173	You have companies that are doing twice or three times as worse as Konami has ever done in terms of milking out the franchise.
8439714	8445340	I know, if one could argue, you could say the same thing with DDR, but there were certain periods in that, you know...
8446789	8452752	in that game's history where there was time in between any major release, especially in the arcade versions.
8454293	8459977	Actdeft in our chatroom says, I still say Squareinodasonics.
8460817	8462098	I can't even pronounce all that.
8463759	8464259	Dream on.
8464839	8465320	No, I don't know.
8465340	8466480	I guess anything's possible, really.
8467741	8468381	So we'll see.
8468422	8472804	We'll probably hear more probably after, I would say after the new year, but I don't know.
8472864	8474145	Sometimes these things tend to move quickly.
8475316	8485682	And that goes to show boys and girls that you don't let any big corporate non-video game company buy a video game company for the sake of doing it.
8485962	8493207	Because chances are, I don't care if they have the best connections to your genre, they're going to pimp you on and bleed you dry.
8493706	8495367	Well, but here's the thing.
8495427	8497288	I'm not so sure I totally agree with that.
8497388	8502771	I'm all for the idea of fight the man and all that stuff and stay independent and all that.
8502811	8509654	But I wonder if Rock Band would have been quite the cultural phenomenon if it hadn't been attached to MTV and Viacom.
8509674	8510514	I'll tell you this much.
8510834	8513796	That Beatles game would have never happened without the Viacom.
8518803	8519584	You're right, yeah.
8519844	8521245	I mean, they have the connections.
8521846	8526690	But on the other hand, they don't understand the video game industry that well.
8527090	8530173	They just see it as something they could easily ride in the short term.
8531014	8536038	And now they think they've ridden it to full term because unfortunately the Beatles game did not perform to expectations.
8536178	8537479	Exactly, that's the whole point.
8537499	8539921	There's a whole variety of reasons why that happened.
8540402	8541643	Same thing with corporate America.
8541703	8542764	It's mostly short-sighted.
8543564	8545166	Especially those guys at Viacom.
8546380	8548262	Alright, buddy, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls.
8548522	8549203	Thank you very much.
8549223	8550084	Have a good one, though.
8550404	8550824	Take care.
8551405	8551865	Have a good one.
8552546	8552826	Bye-bye.
8565976	8571661	Some folks are saying, AkumaJP says in our chatroom, I'm not saying Konami is buying anything, but Konami is not that small.
8572061	8573883	They're in a lot of businesses, not just games.
8574923	8584832	Here's my reasoning for saying that, is that I think a lot of that is very Japanese-based, and Harmonix is also an American developer, and Konami has really scaled back their operations here in America.
8585232	8591237	I mean, some of the best music stuff they were producing was out of Hawaii, Gone, and then Emeryville.
8591497	8592157	DarkSakura,
8606567	8609648	Well, regardless, they were in the Bay and now they're not anymore.
8609668	8611809	Was it in Redwood City or something?
8611969	8613049	Yeah, it was Redwood City.
8613129	8614170	No, that's in Washington.
8614750	8614930	No.
8615190	8615910	No, that's Redmond.
8615931	8618291	It's somewhere.
8618732	8623153	Anyhow, the point is they've scaled back their American operations quite a bit.
8623433	8627895	So unless they've got the money to throw down to try and expand it again, I don't know if I see that happening.
8629355	8635178	Anyhow, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8635318	8636719	All one word if you want to give us a call.
8637239	8638300	We're taking calls right now.
8639401	8642282	Any other last minute stories you want to get to, Loki, while we wait for some calls?
8642342	8643243	If any are going to come in?
8644523	8645284	Let's see.
8645424	8648646	Mushi Hime Sama Bug Panic is coming out.
8648666	8648966	Hime.
8649426	8649766	Hime.
8649986	8653688	Mushi Hime Sama Bug Panic is coming out on iPhone.
8653809	8654609	Mushroom Princess.
8655630	8656010	November 18th.
8658268	8660129	I'm looking forward to that.
8660629	8662030	It's actually a cave adventure game.
8662110	8664811	That's the Castlevania person doing music, right?
8664831	8665191	Yes, it is.
8665231	8666612	I remember that from a previous show.
8666772	8670813	The actual Mushihime-sama is a shooter, but this is an adventure game.
8674415	8675175	I have covered this.
8678517	8679377	Call us, people!
8679797	8680798	It's still a shooter.
8681898	8683879	It's just she's running around instead.
8684795	8685736	Wow, it worked.
8685876	8689358	Like, right as she said that, DarkSakura, our phones started lighting off the hook.
8689538	8690519	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
8690539	8690879	Who's this?
8691519	8692300	Hey, this is Excellent.
8692360	8694081	Hey, it's like all our regular callers tonight.
8694101	8694721	What's on your mind, buddy?
8695322	8696062	Hey, nothing much.
8697303	8698263	I'll make it short and sweet.
8698283	8700645	What kind of games are you looking forward to this holiday season?
8702242	8703704	Hmm.
8703824	8706647	Well, definitely the WoW nerd in me is excited for Cataclysm.
8706687	8707427	I think that's a duh.
8708408	8710590	I think otherwise most of them have come out now.
8710651	8714314	I think Kinect was one of the things I was looking forward to with Dance Central and all that.
8714394	8715115	Very interesting.
8715956	8719840	Civ V was certainly one that I was looking forward to as well, and now that's already happened.
8720640	8733764	Otherwise, you know, we're not looking at a lot of big games that I'm interested in because of the fact that we have the console evolutions, if you will, between the Move and the Kinect.
8733944	8734364	Kinect.
8735504	8737665	As far as the Wii goes, though, sadly not a lot.
8737985	8742266	The other thing I'm really looking forward to is the 3DS, and sadly they didn't make it for this holiday, but next year.
8744267	8745127	Will you be playing it?
8745207	8747368	Because I know you're not really big in handheld games.
8747870	8748391	You know what?
8748531	8751033	I'm not, but the 3DS was something else.
8751213	8754356	The 3DS brings me something that I can't get on my TV.
8754396	8768008	Do you think just by getting it, you're going to be doing it because, I'm not sure you said because of the hype, but it's going to be one of those things where you're like, oh, I want to play it, and then after you play it, you're like, okay, I played it, and kind of like the Wii and the rest of the system, then just put it aside and just collect dust?
8769066	8795892	probably but there's also that part of me that's kind of like as a gaming enthusiast this is definitely something really new for games well I get yeah I mean you could say well what about Rad Racer and the Virtual Boy but I don't know something about 3DS I think is going to really resonate with people the way these things of the past haven't I think just part of as a gaming fanatic I kind of owe it to myself to pick one up
8797154	8798836	Are you going to pick it up on day one?
8800337	8807624	Most likely because if that Kid Icarus game is coming out day one, which I don't see why it wouldn't be, again, I really have to have that.
8808966	8812449	Somebody who's loved that game since it was out back in the day.
8812789	8815552	Are you afraid possibly the Kid Icarus games are going to turn into the Metroid M?
8816764	8823814	I haven't played Metroid M. I'm not so sold on the fact that it's as terrible as everyone's making it out to be, but I'm also a Metroid fanboy.
8823834	8831685	Yeah, of course, there's always the possibility the game's going to be terrible, so I guess I'll waste some of the early reviews and early impressions, but...
8833027	8835289	I don't think that'll stop me from eventually wanting to pick it up.
8835349	8839814	I mean, most Nintendo first party games are still pretty solid.
8840234	8844037	It's very rare that Nintendo puts out a first party stinker.
8844418	8846920	Let's not forget Other M isn't a first party game.
8848261	8849221	I mean, it is and it isn't.
8849761	8850262	You know what I mean?
8850842	8855243	So, most games that Nintendo does in-house themselves are pretty darn good.
8855303	8863945	I mean, they have made some stinkers and some things that were better on paper than they were in-game, like Nintendogs.
8865345	8869146	But Nintendogs also really called out to a certain audience that just wasn't me.
8869666	8869966	You know?
8870427	8872007	Little kids love Nintendogs.
8872682	8874583	and get mauled by them too because of playing them.
8875464	8877385	Yes, I remember that story from a few weeks ago.
8877845	8878886	What about you, X-Link?
8879126	8880867	Turning around and putting it right back on you.
8880907	8882368	What are you looking forward to this holiday season?
8883220	8884760	Too many games, too little time.
8885241	8892002	I have too many on my Steam account to still go through, and then I'm worried about what's going to happen come this Christmas if Steam does something compared to last year.
8892182	8892702	Oh, they will.
8893163	8894043	Absolutely they will.
8895043	8900444	And, you know, it's funny because I have Metroid Other M. I haven't got the time since I moved to set up my Wii.
8900504	8908546	I just recently set up my Wii, so I'm going to probably sit down this week and play it for a little while to see how good it is or see how much of a flop.
8908746	8909787	But it should be interesting.
8910347	8910747	But, um...
8911041	8912483	Anyone in studio want to chime in on this?
8912563	8914244	The game they're really looking forward to this holiday?
8914945	8917768	I'm not really looking forward to a game, actually.
8919269	8921632	I want to save my money and go to Disneyland.
8922912	8923332	There you go.
8923872	8926573	A lot of other stuff that I wasn't... I want to play in Flynn's Arcade.
8926733	8927573	Oh, the Tron game.
8927773	8928954	I'm looking forward to the Tron game.
8928974	8929894	Yes, yes, yes, the Tron game.
8929914	8930874	The Tron game does look good.
8931514	8932815	It's Prince of Persia with Tron.
8933075	8935615	Are you very afraid of them dropping the ball on that also?
8935635	8944118	Because that's my biggest concern is that it looks good and you can see pictures and you see the demos and stuff, but then when it comes out, it'll be like... Of course.
8944158	8945238	What did they do to this?
8946359	8949221	X-Link Movie tie-in games are almost always terrible.
8949361	8952463	There are very few movie tie-in games that ever do very well.
8952864	8958288	GoldenEye is like the biggest exception to a rule in the history of ever.
8958488	8959268	Like, you know what I mean?
8965433	8967375	No, that's why Pierce Brosnan was in it.
8967535	8969497	It was out there to support the movie.
8970017	8972039	And the game was better than the movie.
8972660	8974581	I mean, that never happens.
8974942	8975502	You know what I mean?
8976423	8979125	So, I think Tron...
8980106	8997007	I don't think Tron is going to be like the oh my god face melting is awesome game ever but I think it will be cool you know just even based on what little bit I played at E3 I think if they can kind of bring something into the story and sort of bridge the gap between the two movies which is what the game is supposed to do that'll be kind of neat
8997987	9001409	Yeah, hopefully they'll keep it much to the movie as possible.
9001489	9009152	That's what I like to hopefully see in that and play because I loved Tron growing up when I grew up as a kid.
9009192	9015535	I saw that and I was totally amazed by the way they did that and I'm looking forward for the one that comes out.
9016414	9021675	Giovede in our chatroom brings up another Wii game that we're kind of neglecting here for the holidays.
9021855	9022495	Epic Mickey.
9022736	9024116	Giovede says, I want Epic Mickey.
9024696	9034778	I think that is going to be probably one of the biggest sellers on the Wii this holiday season because I think it does a good job of something for hardcore and casual players.
9035138	9035378	Yeah.
9035699	9038579	At least for the hardcore who haven't abandoned their Wiis altogether.
9039019	9044141	And I think at the same time, it's a game that kids can play and they'll be kind of excited about it.
9044221	9045241	It's sort of like...
9046041	9047903	And I'm looking forward to the new Donkey Kong.
9047943	9052326	I really want to see how that lives up to the other ones, so that would be fun.
9065689	9065969	All right.
9066590	9068773	Well, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can go wrap up the show.
9069073	9069934	Thank you so much for your call.
9069974	9070495	I appreciate it.
9070515	9070835	No problem.
9070936	9071857	I'm going to go fishing.
9071877	9072117	See you.
9072277	9074560	I hope you're able to play a million games this holiday season.
9075421	9076723	You better still make great nights.
9076743	9078845	Between WoW and everything, I don't know how it's going to go.
9079887	9080107	All right.
9080127	9080648	Have a good one, buddy.
9081128	9081308	Yep.
9081328	9081589	You too.
9082284	9083665	Alright, that's going to do it for calls tonight.
9083685	9086026	Thank you guys so much for trying to call.
9086526	9089047	For those that didn't get through because we got slammed at the end there.
9089067	9089367	I don't know.
9089507	9091208	It's so weird how it comes in phases like that.
9092008	9092888	Please send us an email.
9093068	9094029	Share your thoughts over email.
9094049	9094569	We'd appreciate it.
9094609	9099051	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or what I like to call Make Jamie Work.
9099971	9100911	Anyhow, that's... What?
9101872	9102252	Love you.
9102392	9103232	I work plenty.
9103472	9103973	I know you do.
9104493	9104813	Alright.
9105473	9107814	You're working very hard on your Knights of the Magic Crystals.
9108394	9109495	I'm not playing it right now.
9111781	9112301	right now.
9112782	9113962	Yeah, because it's all on cooldown.
9114022	9114902	Yeah, it's all on cooldown.
9114922	9116123	She spent all her points for the hour.
9116403	9119104	If the chat room was working for me, I would be in there.
9119204	9120085	I am messing.
9120825	9121745	Slow your roll.
9122345	9123146	It's going to be okay.
9123186	9124887	What?
9124907	9127047	903 is when the band was lifted, I looked.
9127127	9127428	What?
9128408	9128488	Oh, 903?
9128728	9132210	Yeah, which is going to be interesting because we're about ready to end the show.
9132470	9134491	No FUs tonight.
9134991	9136691	Yeah, we can't do FUs or a cage match.
9136711	9137712	We can't take votes in a cage match.
9137732	9140153	Well, 903 is only a few minutes away.
9140956	9143478	Yeah, well, can we stretch for 12 more minutes?
9143498	9144458	Do you have more last-minute stories?
9144838	9145899	It's not really 12 minutes.
9146759	9147720	I guess it's 12 minutes.
9148721	9152323	We can indeed still do Cage Match, Rob, because you tally the votes.
9153143	9155104	And I can add some extra windows to that.
9155425	9157506	Okay, I was like, I don't know how to do private messages on here.
9157546	9159387	Okay, if you know how to do it, then we can figure it out.
9160247	9164110	But I still should ask if there's any other last-minute stories, because I didn't really let Loki finish.
9165831	9165871	No.
9167472	9167692	No.
9168092	9170463	Well, I could talk about some other stuff, I guess.
9170523	9170865	Sure.
9171186	9171949	I suppose.
9175728	9182290	The PlayStation 3, there was supposed to be a new jailbreak device that got put out, but it was supposed to be a downgrader.
9182911	9187252	Of course, right now, it's kind of in limbo of whether or not that's actually legit or not.
9188092	9189033	Most people think it's not.
9190073	9196735	But of course, people found ways around different protections, including getting Black Ops to work.
9197396	9198156	So, it's kind of funny.
9201375	9223509	and then what else was going to talk about oh yeah Darksiders 2 got announced it's supposed to take place alongside the original Darksiders series I guess they're going to have up to four games because it's going to be one for each horseman of the apocalypse because they're saying that there's only one apocalypse and it wouldn't make sense to have a sequel to the game Final Fantasy always has an apocalypse
9224386	9228107	Yeah, but that's Final Fantasy, and you know, that's just very unrealistic.
9228787	9232428	Whereas Darksiders, you know, absolutely full of realism.
9232468	9234849	Aren't video games all supposed to be a little bit unrealistic?
9234949	9236129	Unless it's like, I don't know, like a sports game?
9236149	9237630	I'm being sarcastic, bro.
9237870	9238930	Oh, oh, oh, my bad.
9239450	9242091	Yes, you just didn't seem to get it, did you?
9242931	9243591	Story of my life.
9243851	9245392	Yeah.
9245412	9246252	Don't agree with that!
9248553	9250213	I think that was more of a dismissive yeah.
9252343	9253884	Other fun stuff that we can mention here.
9253964	9254925	We'll just go through all the stories.
9255885	9257987	Grand Theft Auto Trilogy coming out on Macs.
9258327	9259828	Wow, that took a long enough time.
9260708	9265051	I had Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on my old PC laptop that I got back in 2005.
9268173	9269834	Yeah, that took some time there.
9270474	9271435	Glad to see that they're...
9272463	9273503	On the ball with that stuff.
9274464	9277925	And then, apparently, was it Crazy Taxis coming out later this month?
9278205	9278825	That's kind of neat.
9278985	9280386	Let's make some crazy money!
9280746	9281826	On Xbox Live Arcade.
9282026	9287008	Of course, it's not going to have all the wonderful, you know, product placement in it.
9287568	9288229	Just have fun.
9288429	9289049	And all the music.
9289309	9290950	All the licensed music is not there anymore.
9292230	9292570	Oh, darn.
9293250	9294091	I love it.
9294171	9296071	AkumaJP in chat is like, What?
9296391	9297612	Final Fantasy is real!
9299651	9300712	Only at anime conventions.
9300932	9301372	Is it real?
9302292	9303053	And this is kind of neat.
9303133	9307195	The tabletop game Zombies apparently is coming to Xbox Live Arcade as well.
9307915	9312037	And I haven't actually played that tabletop game, but it looks like it might be fun.
9312377	9313378	America loves zombies.
9314058	9317200	It's also, I guess, it might be coming to Windows 7 as well.
9317460	9318100	Windows Phone 7.
9318600	9319841	I love plants versus zombies.
9321242	9322542	Apparently that will be the first quarter of 2011.
9322842	9326204	And I guess it was announced three years ago.
9327785	9328065	All right.
9329468	9334432	We still need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, so I don't want you to keep feeling like you have to buy time.
9334532	9337214	Is that all you want to mention, or are there any other stories that are killing you over there?
9337234	9338355	Nope, that's it.
9339016	9341137	You know, we could always just watch the boobie video again.
9341317	9342318	No, I'm kidding.
9342858	9345420	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up for the night.
9346161	9348383	We might actually end at midnight Eastern tonight.
9348523	9349403	What a change of pace.
9349904	9352406	The East Coast listeners will be getting embedded at a decent hour.
9352446	9352846	Thanks, you guys.
9353607	9358933	Anyhow, let's go around to everybody's final thoughts and try to wrap up the show tonight and say thanks for listening and all that.
9359434	9362618	Salacious Pop, thank you so much for being here, as always.
9362998	9365261	And do you have any final thoughts tonight for our listeners?
9368843	9369023	No.
9371245	9372745	He's a man of many words tonight.
9373146	9376948	All right, Loki, do you have any final thoughts tonight?
9377448	9377829	Not really.
9377849	9382712	I'm just going to try to play more stuff this week and get some more sleep, and I don't know.
9383352	9384032	That's all I can do.
9385193	9389076	My final thought is I'm really going to try to avoid getting pink eye again because it sucks.
9390536	9391497	DarkSakura, your final thought?
9392298	9394239	I'm still getting used to the stuff on my face.
9395242	9395602	Your hair?
9395802	9396843	My hair.
9396863	9397603	I have bangs now.
9397803	9398263	I like your hair.
9399143	9399483	It's cute.
9401164	9401444	All right.
9402244	9404245	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9404265	9406846	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and supporting us.
9406886	9407786	We really appreciate it.
9408126	9411147	Hey, if you like what you heard tonight, please tell people about our show.
9411187	9412307	Tell two people about our show.
9412647	9413568	Help us spread the word.
9413868	9416548	Kind reviews on iTunes are always helpful as well.
9416588	9419249	Just anything you can do because we don't have advertising.
9419509	9421310	We're not running advertising on the show, you notice, too.
9422130	9425111	It's really the only way we can help spread word of mouth
9425191	9428573	And stop asking about me fixing the PSP site.
9428933	9433175	Literally, I get like 10 minutes a week to myself to work on stuff.
9433315	9434535	I'd do it if I knew how, but I don't.
9435496	9437777	I will need to talk to you about getting the FTP code.
9437837	9440518	It's been so long since I've actually gone and done anything.
9440638	9441138	That I can do.
9441498	9442379	We can work that out.
9442859	9446040	Alright, that's going to do it anyway, so Loki's aware, folks.
9446080	9446881	He'll try what he can.
9447741	9448381	But yeah, that's it.
9448461	9449042	We're done.
9449122	9450822	Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
9450962	9451783	We'll see you next week.
9451823	9452723	We'll do this all over again.
9452763	9453063	Episode 390.
9455353	9456694	We'll see you next week, guys!
9483936	9485981	But we're probably right anyway.
9486523	9487365	See you next week!
