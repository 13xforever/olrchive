Tonight, November 21st, 2010

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Layoffs and downsizing hit four game studios

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Developers pay a premium to create the 3DS

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And did Nintendo give away a prototype version of a classic game?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The video game podcast where every gamer has a voice

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We do tape live and for all the information to listen to us live

Visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll be working with you over the next few hours with my co-host

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The one and only Dark Sakura

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hi

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi, how are you? Dark Sakura?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Jamie Summers

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm alright

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Happiest bunny on the farm?

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You seem like a little bit of a sad bunny tonight

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I am a little bit of a sad bunny but it's alright

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Do you want a hug? I'll come give you a hug

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I prefer the chocolate ones, thank you

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You need candy

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Alright, well I hope some discussion on video games will help brighten your spirits

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You know, I had a terra-bad week this week

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I mean, it was really awful

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Was it bigger than a giga-bad?

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It was a terra-bad, actually

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's what I was saying

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It was

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, but I did the other show

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because now I'm juggling two shows just like you

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And that actually put me in a lot better mood

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So podcasting hopefully will brighten your spirits

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We'll see

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Cool, I was watching V before you came over

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
New V or old V?

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
New V

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I stopped about halfway on new V

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Not because I hated it

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It was hard for me to watch TV every week

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I caught up on Supernatural so I was just sitting

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Marathon-ing stuff because I didn't feel like doing anything

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I heard a lot of people that kind of like watch TV while they play games

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A friend of mine on the WoW guild was telling me about how he was leveling to 80

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
While watching Arrested Development on Netflix

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Fun

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, yeah, good times

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Alright, say hello as well to somebody who will hopefully make us laugh tonight

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If not, he's fired

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, just kidding

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How are you, Loki?

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm fine

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright, what's new in your world?

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Anything new, fun going on?

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Not much, just eating bad for me pizza

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Alright, is your mic even on?

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We are having a real hard time hearing you tonight

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Did you plug me in the wrong hole again?

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No, you're good

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I just, we just had to get you angry in order to hear you, I think

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No?

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't, it's very quiet

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's very, very quiet

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Live radio, some of the perks

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We'll try and fix his stuff all in one

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Fix me now!

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, you're definitely fixed now, alright

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Everybody's just all quiet and somber tonight

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Must be the weather

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The weather changing is

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I call it complete and utter apathy

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Last night was, was it thunder, I was in the bay

82
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But it was thunderstorming, like crazy

83
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It was fantastic

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It was a light the candles type of day

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I love rain, I love rain a lot

86
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But the whole problem with rain is that it makes me intensely homesick

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And also nobody can drive in the rain

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Is the other big problem

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Nobody from here

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No, yeah, big problem with the rain

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Alright, if you've never listened to Orange Launch Radio before

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I haven't given this spiel in a while, so I'll just say hello

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you've never listened to our show before, we do tape live

94
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And the three of us here, Dark Soccer, myself and Loki

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We all met playing video games at the local arcade

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It was Dance Dance Revolution, ironically enough

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Was the game that brought us together

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So for a long time we did a show about music games

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And, well, things evolve, things change

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And now we're podcasting about all the video games that are out there

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
From the classics, Atari 2600, NES, Sega

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All the way to the new stuff on the PS3 and 360

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We like to talk about the news and talk about it with you guys

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Cause, you know, we, we know you guys are smart

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You go on game blogs, if you subscribe to this show

106
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You probably read the big game blogs

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You already know a lot of the news

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But we like to talk about it and discuss it

109
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And get your perspective

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And to do that we always have the present fourth guest on our show

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But of course we're also gonna take calls later in the show

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There's our Twitter, our Facebook, and all that fun stuff

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But we do always start off the show with a little bit of

115
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How was your gaming week where we talk about the video games

116
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You've been playing this week

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Um, kind of, not much of anything

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I played Star Trek Online for like an hour this week

120
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And, yeah, oh, Angry Birds

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The game is retarded and fun

122
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why do you think so many people are into Angry Birds on the iPhone?

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Like, I have to admit, it's not a game that's ever really interested me

124
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But it seems like everybody is playing this game

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Because pigs aren't kosher

126
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You just, you fight evil pigs

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, I see, I see

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And they're not kosher

130
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So I kill them

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
By toppling bricks on top of them

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Until they poof and die

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And they get all beat up and bruised beforehand

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So it's really great

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And you've got chickens that explode

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Poor piggies that can't defend themselves

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Aw

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Um, well they're idiot pigs anyway

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Um

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Maybe that'll be the sequel to Angry Birds, idiot pigs

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I found my Digimon

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's way dead, but I found my old school Digimon

143
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Was that, did they actually

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The brick looking ones

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Like, that were like the Tamagotchis?

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, but they could connect

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I never knew they had those

148
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I always thought Digimon was just like a Gameboy game

149
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, and an anime

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, but they were actually made from

151
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I think the same company that did the Tamagotchi

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Or something like that

153
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But anyway, you could connect the two end to end

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And they would battle

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And uh

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It finally is dead, we finally just got rid of it

157
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We cleaned out a lot of stuff in the house

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was gonna say, the battery must have given out after all this time

159
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You leave a battery in something way too long

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Then it just goes bad

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Um

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We've got rid of a lot of stuff

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But we're also sitting aside, I guess, some swag for people

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I guess

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And

166
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, that's about it

167
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, we picked a Brad Racer

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Did I say that already last week?

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't remember

170
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you get some Elite 3D glasses to go with it?

171
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No

173
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And uh

174
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, that's about it

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's really about it

176
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Alright

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing this week?

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Um

179
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Not as much as I was going to

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But I played basically Grand Theft Auto

181
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And some of the Kinect stuff

182
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like I was demonstrating the Kinect things for a few of my

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Fellow employees

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So a little bit of Kinect Adventures

185
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Which is

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know, not surprisingly

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Very boring, you know

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So many times I can play the River Rafting game

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Or even the other games in there without going

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Eh, whatever

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I've been playing more Dance Central

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Which is pretty fun

193
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Playing some of the more difficult songs

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Which aren't that difficult

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But it's just different

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I was playing Jungle Boogie a little bit

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And um

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, more Grand Theft Auto

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's pretty much it

200
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've played some of the iPhones

201
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You know, iPod stuff

202
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But uh

203
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Not really anything worth mentioning

204
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Just like, you know, I've played a few games of

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You know, the Stick Wars stuff

206
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Um

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I haven't got a chance to play Rage yet

208
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Um, because I went

209
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Downloaded it

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Synced it with my iTunes

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And somehow it deleted the game

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Off my iPod

213
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And in iTunes I'm like

214
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And I also have Lego Harry Potter

215
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Where I haven't played that yet either

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Is that the one that's supposed to use Kinect?

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Like, I knew there was a Harry Potter game that uses Kinect in some fashion

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No, Lego Harry Potter, it's the one on

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The iOS stuff

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, I'm sorry, you're still on iOS

221
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No, no, no

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There's a Harry Potter in Deathly Hallows Part 1

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, that's what I was thinking

224
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And it has like a little on rail shooter portion

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That you can use Kinect for

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But apparently it's really dumb

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, it's early

228
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Tech demos turned into games

229
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's still tacked on

230
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hey, you know what, it's better than nothing

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You know, they could have just done nothing

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you find yourself

233
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yourself still playing

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Kinect a couple weeks later?

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Because I kind of stopped

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Um, yeah, Dance Central

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I've actually been playing Dance Central

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's pretty fun actually

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And funny enough, I got some of my other employees into it

240
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They were like really

241
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It was surprising

242
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't think they would try Dance Central

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I had one of my co-workers playing Just Dance

244
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This guy, you know

245
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Purple Belt and Tae Kwon Do

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And stuff

247
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Just not

248
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The person that would be playing

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That song

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You know what, there's no shame in having fun

251
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, not at all

252
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Even if the song's a little fruity, it's fun

253
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He thought it was hilarious, so

254
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, it's fun

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The problem really is

256
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't have room to play it

257
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I play it at work

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We have our game room

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I guess, it's in a conference room

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So I take the conference room table that's split in two

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I push one to one end of the wall

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
One to the other end of the wall

263
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And it gives me a good ten feet

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
By ten feet space that I can actually play in

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You don't know how lucky you are to be able to turn

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In your conference room at work into like

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
A gaming hotspot, it's amazing

268
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
To me

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, I guess

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's part of the deal

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I guess, so

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Anything else?

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, that's pretty much it

274
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I had a pretty dramatic week

275
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
In World of Warcraft

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I won't get into all the details

277
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The good news is I don't have to subject you guys

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now that I have the spin-off show, I don't have to subject you guys to all the talk anymore

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But I'll say it was a very traumatic week

280
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Because my authenticator reset itself

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, I don't know how it happened either

282
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I had to make a phone call to Blizzard and all that

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
At least you didn't swallow yours

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No, what happened?

285
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Some person swallowed their authenticator

286
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No, mine's on my iPhone

287
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And somehow it just reset

288
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I couldn't restore it from backup

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
None of it would work

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It would just give me the new serial number

291
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And you can't input your own serial number

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So, it was weird

293
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And then Wednesday, my guild got the first

294
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Kill of the Lich King ever

295
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But I wasn't there because I had to drop out of the raid

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Because Comcast kept cutting out on me

297
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And so, yep, wasn't there

298
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So anyway, I won't get into all the details about it

299
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's on the other show, Horde House now

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's kind of odd

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Now I don't get to go on these long Warcraft tangents on the show anymore

302
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You can still go on the tangents

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Now I feel like I'm spent, I already went on that tangent

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't want to do it again

305
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So yeah, it was an interesting week in Warcraft

306
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But let me talk about other games, because there were other games I was playing as well

307
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Maybe I wasn't playing the Kinect games so much

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But I did kind of go on this demo downloading

309
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Binge of stuff I've just kind of missed on

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
One of those games I checked out was

311
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Super Meat Boy

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Which, actually was kind of cool

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Like, the demo is very robust for that game

314
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I get the sense it's a flash game that's been converted somehow

315
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But there's a lot, well it's Newgrounds

316
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So that was kind of a sign right there

317
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But it had a surprising amount of depth to it

318
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
One of the mechanics I really liked is that

319
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know, you're on this Mario style map

320
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Doing all the little challenges

321
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But when you get an A plus on a level

322
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Meaning you beat the level within the par time

323
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You can hit a button to go to the dark side

324
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And you can hit a button to go to the dark side

325
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You can hit a button to go to the dark world

326
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Where you play the stage again

327
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And it's like the exact same map

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Only harder

329
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Like maybe there will be more saw blades out now

330
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Or more enemies

331
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So I thought that was kind of a neat mechanic

332
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And one of the things I really like

333
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is that the game plays very fast

334
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Every stage is meant to be beat in like under a minute

335
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And some of them are literally like 10 seconds long

336
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So it's almost like micro games

337
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But you might have to play the round

338
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like, not even kidding

339
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
50 times

340
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
To get the rhythm just right

341
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
To time that jump just right

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So you can kind of get through the gap

343
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And do like a jump around

344
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You know what I mean when you jump to the right

345
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And then push control over the left to get around an obstacle

346
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You know, you kind of do all these weird sorts of things

347
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But what I like is that when you finally beat the level

348
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You get to see an instant replay

349
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But the instant replay isn't just

350
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The replay of you beating it

351
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's the replay of every single attempt you made

352
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
At the level all at once

353
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And you'll see like 50 little meat guys

354
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
All jumping and you see them all dying

355
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's actually really clever

356
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And a really neat game mechanic

357
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And I'm sure I've got to have seen this somewhere before

358
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But I can't think of anything

359
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So I was very surprised at what a robust demo it was

360
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And I was very pleased with it

361
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I do plan on buying the full game

362
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I would have never guessed this was a game that interests me

363
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because I'm going to be honest

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And this is going to sound really weird

365
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I should be made fun of for this

366
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I'm okay with that

367
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But the gameplay and the artwork

368
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Of like that red case with the weird

369
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Funny green toothy thing

370
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Made me, honestly

371
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I kind of looked at it and went, what's this super meat

372
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That sounds stupid

373
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That game sounds stupid, that looks stupid

374
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's kind of amazing how much judgement

375
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I passed on this game, really not knowing dick about it

376
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And I was wrong

377
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I can admit that

378
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But at the same time

379
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I was a little kind of turned off by

380
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why didn't you try to like

381
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know, put a little more

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Into the retro

383
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Jokes like on the box art

384
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Or something, like that whole like red gritting

385
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Face just was a little silly to me

386
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't know, I'm sure

387
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm not even looking at chat because I'm sure I'm being

388
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Taunted for being irrational right now

389
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But it did kind of make me step back and go

390
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Wow, you do kind of put a lot of thought

391
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Into even like what's on the front

392
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Of a box

393
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
As to whether I'll pull it off the shelf

394
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I realize this is all happening virtually

395
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll pull it off the shelf and read the back of the box

396
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So, kind of interesting

397
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So again if you want to go

398
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com you can join us

399
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay now I'm being brave and reading it there

400
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Um

401
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let's see, uh

402
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Sorry I'm reading this live here

403
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Dark Tetsuya says

404
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Don't forget Alien Hominid was a Newgrounds

405
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Game too, that's true, that was kind of a cool game

406
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The Castle Crashers, was that a Newgrounds?

407
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It was the very same style

408
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Very similar style

409
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Only Hemeth did that and they had done

410
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Alien Hominid, I think that's the deal

411
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They've done Alien Hominid, yeah

412
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So

413
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So I played that and I definitely want to pick up the full

414
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Version of that, I also played Pac-Man Championship

415
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Edition DX

416
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Which I thought was kind of a worthy

417
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Upgrade based on the demo I played

418
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You know, more maps

419
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Different skins looking thing

420
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But they also made a couple big changes to the mechanic

421
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That make it worthy of an upgrade, one of them is

422
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Bombs, which I know sounds very weird for a Pac-Man

423
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Game, but how often

424
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
In Pac-Man do you get trapped in a corner

425
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Where there's a ghost coming one way and there's

426
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
A ghost coming the other way and you're like, oh shit

427
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm fucked, now I realize that's the whole point

428
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Of Pac-Man, but this being a sequel

429
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You get to try new things, so now you have

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
A bomb and you can hit this bomb and it

431
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Blows the ghost out of your way

432
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So you can get through, it's

433
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
A simple thing that kind of adds

434
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
A whole new level to it, I don't want to say it makes it easier

435
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But now you can

436
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Get yourself in different situations

437
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Than you were able to before, if that makes sense

438
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The other thing that's kind of cool

439
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
About the game is that you have these like

440
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Sleeping ghosts, we'll say

441
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
These ghosts that just stand in place and don't do anything

442
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Until you go right next to them

443
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And once you go right next to them

444
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They'll wake up and start to chase you

445
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But they chase you in a very

446
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Logical pattern, like they just keep following you

447
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And if you do this right

448
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You'll get like 30 ghosts

449
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
All in a row, and then pick up a power pellet

450
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And you'll just go chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp

451
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And you'll just rack up a high score there

452
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So I thought that was kind of a neat new

453
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Mechanic, so just a couple new little twists

454
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Kind of breeze fresh life

455
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Into a game and I thought it was pretty awesome

456
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And the music was really cool

457
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So yeah, I gotta say

458
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I haven't read on the net

459
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What the reception is to this game, I don't know if people

460
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Are saying unnecessary copy or whatever

461
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But I gotta admit, I find the

462
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Few little twists

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
To really kind of bring new life

464
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Into what was otherwise a game that you know

465
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Was, you know, it's been on the iPhone

466
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And the Xbox

467
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You know, we've kind of seen it

468
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Several times over the past few years, so

469
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I thought that was cool, so

470
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandsreader.com

471
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Salacious Pop says, it's amazing

472
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The music alone, if you use a bomb

473
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
On a chain of 40 plus ghosts and they all fly back

474
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Into the base, it's a very epic satisfying

475
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Feeling, that's very true

476
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I agree with that

477
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Black Wolf is clarifying an earlier comment I was saying

478
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Castle Crashers used Newgrounds for the music

479
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
At least, that makes sense

480
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There was, definitely

481
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
A lot of those games have the same look

482
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And feel and so forth

483
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Another game I checked out on Xbox Live

484
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Again, these are all demos and I always feel weird

485
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
About reviewing demos, but a lot of these were very

486
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Robust, and I think

487
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Still

488
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
When you're gonna put a demo of your game

489
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Out there, you're kind of putting

490
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It out there to be, to have

491
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Your entire game judged, should I drop

492
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
$10 on this, yes or no

493
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I feel somewhat justified in that

494
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Salacious Pop is reminding me

495
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I also played Guang

496
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Guangi?

497
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't even know how to pronounce this game, but I did play that

498
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
On Xbox Live, and

499
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I know we have a really diehard

500
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Shmup fan in the chatroom that's gonna really hate me

501
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
For this, but I didn't get it, I didn't get it at all

502
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I liked that it was

503
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Different, but I didn't understand

504
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What the hell I was doing, it was just bullets everywhere

505
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Ahh!

506
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Apparently there's reskinned modes, but they're not really in the demo

507
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It was just the first level of the arcade game that was in the demo

508
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I had no idea what the eff I was doing

509
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You know, not being the big

510
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It seems like a lot of the

511
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Cave shooters that they're bringing over

512
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No offense, it's like

513
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You could like

514
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Randomly show me different, you know

515
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Video from a bunch of different ones

516
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
They all look the same

517
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, but to be fair, Loki, this game wasn't

518
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The same, and that was kind of what

519
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I will say I liked about it, because

520
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What was cool about it is that

521
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
For one, this character I was playing

522
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You didn't just fire bullets, but you had a

523
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Wolf that you moved around the screen

524
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And bombs would fire from

525
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The wolf or something, I don't know

526
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But it was a different mechanic

527
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So it didn't make it feel like every other shoot-em-up

528
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So I don't think you can say every shoot-em-up

529
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Is the same, it's just that

530
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Because maybe I was

531
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Expecting to understand it

532
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Because I played a lot of other shoot-em-ups

533
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It was really confusing to me

534
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
At first, but I don't know

535
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't know

536
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Um

537
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Anyhow, that was

538
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That was the game

539
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If I spent more time with it, I'd probably enjoy it

540
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Or if I was more of a fan of the

541
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Shoot-em-up games, and really understood

542
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What was so different

543
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I should have spent more time with it, really

544
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But again, demos were supposed to sell me on the full games

545
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And after playing the demos I did

546
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This week, I'm like, I'm more interested in going back

547
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And playing more Super Meat Boy, which I never thought

548
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'd say a couple weeks ago

549
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
They have that

550
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
To internets on there and stuff

551
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That they unlock new levels

552
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Every now and

553
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Every once in a while without sort of

554
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Updates, I guess

555
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Did you say Super Meat Boy? Oh, no

556
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I wasn't aware of that, that's cool

557
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It seemed like there was a lot of

558
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
People

559
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ray in our chat room is a little irritated

560
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
At what Loki just said

561
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I could say the same of any genre

562
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
All MMOs are the same

563
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
All genre are the same

564
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, but I'm saying that the actual artwork

565
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Looks very similar game to game

566
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm not saying all shooters are the same

567
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That doesn't make any sense

568
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm saying that these games play very much alike

569
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Like, I played a bunch of different cave shooters

570
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And they play very similar

571
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm telling you, this doesn't play like the other ones

572
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, big deal

573
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's a different thing that they added in there

574
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It was different

575
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Because you could kind of

576
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Fire at the bullets and stuff

577
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't think

578
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
People should pass judgment so quickly

579
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's still fun, I'm just saying

580
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
At least try it out

581
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They're not like night and day

582
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's not like comparing

583
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
A Gradius game with

584
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Ikaruga or something like that

585
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Two games that have very different

586
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Looks to them

587
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Maybe similar

588
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Types of gameplay, obviously

589
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Ikaruga would be a lot harder

590
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't know

591
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Maybe it's just because they're all done with spray

592
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Animation and stuff like that

593
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It just seems very

594
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Similar

595
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You could show me one of those games and be like

596
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh man, that was a cave shooter

597
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't know

598
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I don't get it

599
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why even bother having any storylines in it?

600
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
There's no point, really

601
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And the last demo I played was for

602
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
King of Fighters 2002

603
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Which, um

604
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I didn't get it

605
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I actually played the Neo Geo fighting franchises

606
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Past Fatal Fury Special

607
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I think was about the last one

608
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
With the exception of Capcom vs SNK

609
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Which is still amazing

610
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The problem is the demo only limits you to

611
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
A handful of characters

612
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
None of which I recognized

613
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And all I did was I button masked

614
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The chick with the whip

615
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And I think her name was actually Whip

616
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes, her name is Whip

617
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And she's on Team Ikari

618
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Very creative

619
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No, she's actually a really cool character

620
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And if you're good with her, she's really effective

621
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But I always use Leona

622
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But who you can't pick in the demo, I don't think

623
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I would have recognized her, so I don't know

624
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I didn't get a good feel for that one from the demo

625
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
She was on the same team with Leona, Clark, Ralph

626
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Haytern

627
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
She's, I guess, Ikari themed

628
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
In the one I played, you were picking teams

629
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You were picking individuals

630
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But I'm saying that her story

631
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Her character comes from the whole Ikari team

632
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Alright

633
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's awesome

634
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They did a Marvel vs. Capcom game

635
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But Capcom vs. SNK

636
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Do it in that style again

637
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Now I know that they've had Capcom vs. SNK

638
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
1 and 2 and stuff

639
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But the crazy over the top style

640
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That is Marvel vs. Capcom

641
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Would be awesome

642
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Because I'm sorry

643
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Just plain as the Metal Slug characters

644
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I know they have

645
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
An SNK game that came out

646
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I think it's already out

647
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
In Xbox Live Arcade

648
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's a port of an arcade game

649
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's like Neo Geo

650
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Battle Colosseum

651
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That has a bunch of those different characters

652
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But it's just not

653
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's not as cool as

654
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Or fast as

655
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Marvel vs. Capcom or something

656
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So that's pretty much all the games

657
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I played this week that are worth mentioning

658
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Although I did play Knights of the Clicky

659
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Clicky Vampire Sorority Life

660
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Farm Town Wars

661
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That too

662
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's so sad

663
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Facebook games really are the future

664
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And there's really no depth to this game

665
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But aren't the boss fights really cool?

666
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They do these little cut scenes and stuff

667
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That makes the whole game worth it to me

668
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
They're alright, you're in my party

669
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You're shaking your head disapprovingly Loki

670
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You don't like Knights of the Clicky Vampire

671
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I haven't played it

672
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And I'm not going to play it

673
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I support you in that, it's fine

674
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I really should not play that

675
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Because if people support games like that

676
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
They're just going to keep making games like that

677
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Well I don't give them money, and I will not give them money

678
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And Alan always teases me

679
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Like, you know you want to buy Squeenix coins

680
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Just to get yourself this stupid armor

681
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
No! No no no no

682
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And he knows how I feel

683
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
No, I'm not spending money

684
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Rob, I have to go do something

685
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Orange lunch foodie-o related

686
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Make some orange soup

687
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
My soup is orange

688
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And what's the soup of the day?

689
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Actually it's soup that I made

690
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's soup that I made

691
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Butternut squash sweet potato pumpkin soup

692
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
With curry and ginger spices

693
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
With shaved onion zucchini and squash in it

694
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And I made it, it's delicious

695
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Thanksgiving is definitely right around the corner

696
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It is, and we have to roast a turkey

697
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We haven't done turkey before

698
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Are you doing the dinner this year?

699
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
No, but we have to contribute another turkey

700
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So I'm making the stuffing for it

701
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And I have a total recipe in my head

702
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
For cranberry apple stuffing

703
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Cornbread stuffing

704
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Because cornbread stuffing is the best

705
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm officially sick of bacon pizza by the way

706
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I noticed you did not bring bacon pizza

707
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
To the show tonight, it was like mushroomy pizza

708
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Or was it actually bacon?

709
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
No, that is bacon pizza

710
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
They burnt the crap out of it

711
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah, thank you

712
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That does not look appetizing

713
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And I actually asked for quadruple bacon pizza

714
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But she's like, triple bacon?

715
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't think they understand more than three

716
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If anyone wants that, I'm not worrying that for you

717
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Um, no, it's

718
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's a little much, it's very heavy

719
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I believe Loki is finally admitting

720
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
There is such a thing as too much bacon

721
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
No, it's just because

722
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I didn't have the correct dipping sauce

723
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I wanted a side of ranch

724
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Well, ranch in round table speak

725
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Is the creamy garlic sauce

726
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The white sauce that they put on pizzas

727
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But some round tables decide

728
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Hey, you know what, we're gonna get some shitty ranch

729
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We're also gonna call that ranch

730
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Or creamy garlic sauce as well

731
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And it's just not as good

732
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Now if I had that, it would be so much better

733
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What you should tell them is that next time

734
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That they make it, is to put your bacon on first

735
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And then put the cheese on top of it

736
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So that the bacon won't burn

737
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Because the oil from the cheese will saturate the bacon

738
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And prevent it from burning

739
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's like our own little Paula Deen right here in the studio

740
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's not so bad even with the burnt bacon

741
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It's just, it's too much

742
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I cook

743
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Don't look at me like that, cause I love Paula Deen

744
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
She's a frightening looking lady

745
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Because she totally looks

746
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Both botoxed and surgicaled

747
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And still looks

748
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Really scary old with those

749
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Overly

750
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Terrified looking eyes

751
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Paula Deen is like the Cher

752
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And you're like the Christina Aguilera

753
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's because she's preserved her body

754
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
With all that fat that she

755
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Takes in

756
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I mean, my god, she's like

757
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I need to put a stick of butter in this one

758
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Put a stick of butter in there

759
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I seem to recall this was a video game podcast

760
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I don't really remember

761
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This is getting back to video games

762
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm just going to make my dinner

763
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm just saying that I'm probably going to stick to like

764
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Cheese pizza or the twist

765
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The twists are damn good

766
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You know, have you thought about maybe like a salad?

767
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't like salad

768
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I've tried salad on multiple occasions

769
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The only salad that I can tolerate

770
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Is like a Caesar salad

771
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And even then, I know that's way not good for me

772
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I just do not like the taste of

773
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Plants, okay

774
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's just, it feels very unnatural

775
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's like a cow trying to tap dance

776
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It just, it doesn't feel natural

777
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Eating plants, what do you think our ancestors

778
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Had to do back in the day?

779
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Well, we've evolved past that now, okay

780
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Why do I have to eat the damn plants?

781
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The animals that I'm eating right now

782
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Have eaten those plants

783
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Alright, look, we gotta get into

784
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And since the pigs, they probably ate garbage too

785
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But you know what?

786
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm not going to eat garbage

787
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Alright

788
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Housekeeping, before we get into news

789
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
We will still have a show next week

790
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I know the holidays are canceling some of your favorite

791
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Podcasts, but thankfully, Sunday

792
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Is kind of a nice day to be on

793
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So we will still be bringing you new shows

794
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Tonight, obviously, and next week

795
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
We're not going to have any time off for the holidays

796
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
We're working hard for you guys

797
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Because we love you

798
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Also, if you want to love us on Facebook

799
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio

800
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Please consider joining our little club there

801
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
On Facebook

802
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And everybody likes to like things, so

803
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yes, so you should like us on Facebook

804
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Which I think is actually what you do

805
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You don't actually join, you just like

806
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Because if people can like things like Chase Bank

807
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Or, you know, Miracle Whip

808
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Then they can like our damn show

809
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Or RuPaul to host

810
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Saturday Night Live and all that stuff

811
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Although that really should happen

812
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
No, it shouldn't

813
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm sorry, he's not, she's not funny

814
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
What?

815
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Stop the show, stop the show

816
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
She's not funny

817
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
RuPaul is amazing

818
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And you need to, have you ever watched

819
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Drag Race, have you ever watched Drag Race

820
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I've seen an episode

821
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Then sit down and shut up, because you're saying no

822
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
In a creative way, you're saying no

823
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm sorry, it would just be weird

824
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's funny, it is

825
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Funny, drag queens are

826
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Funny

827
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Alright, fine, then if you bring RuPaul on there

828
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You need to have at least more than one

829
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Drag queen on there, because

830
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Just a show about

831
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Nothing but drag queens competing to

832
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Be the biggest

833
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Cunt of them all

834
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Well that's not Saturday Night Live, that's why I'm saying

835
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You need more drag queens on there if you're gonna bring her on there

836
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Those guys dress up as chicks all the time

837
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
On Saturday Night Live

838
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This is the only video gaming podcast

839
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Where you will hear

840
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
A very straight guy arguing

841
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
With a very gay guy about drag queens

842
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm just saying

843
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
RuPaul needs a video game

844
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You know you want it

845
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm just telling you

846
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
If they made a game for Connect called

847
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You better work

848
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Okay, I get it

849
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
See?

850
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And you know you want RuPaul being all

851
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Alright, let's see that dance again

852
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And don't fuck it up

853
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But Rob, alternate costume has to be the suit

854
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
From Drag U

855
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And we could

856
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It could film you on the Connect device

857
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But then like as you do better

858
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It just starts to put like

859
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Costume parts on you, it'd be really funny

860
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And then we make Loki play it

861
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And take pictures and upload them to the interwebs

862
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Hilarity

863
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That's up there with Tingle

864
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Alright, anyhow

865
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Loomis

866
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Just join chat

867
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Just to tell Loki to get a sense of humor

868
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Hahaha

869
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh, Loki

870
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Alright, also Twitter

871
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

872
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Not Twitter.com slash RuPaul

873
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Just saying

874
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Alright, let's actually get into some video game news

875
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Which I'm only trying to make you laugh

876
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because the news we have is very depressing

877
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I think it's funny

878
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Not me

879
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You are rude

880
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That's hilarious, Bizarre Creations

881
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Is terrible

882
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's like, hey, you know what

883
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
We decided to have a really terrible idea

884
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And release a Bond game

885
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That's based off of no movie whatsoever

886
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And we're gonna pimp out Daniel Craig

887
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
In it again because we apparently

888
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Own the likeness of Daniel Craig

889
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
For a long time now, that's why he's also

890
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
In Goldeneye

891
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But yes, Bizarre Creations

892
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
They've done some pretty awesome things

893
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And some pretty terrible things

894
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Awesome being their racing games

895
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Project Gotham Racing Series

896
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Cooler, terrible being

897
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And Geometry Wars

898
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes, Geometry Wars, the awesome

899
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Racing game

900
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What the hell, you need to listen

901
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
No, Geometry Wars is an amazing game

902
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Stop interrupting me

903
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
No!

904
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Yes, you shut up

905
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Other things that were awesome

906
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Non-racing

907
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Geometry Wars

908
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Terrible things that they've released

909
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The Club

910
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes, they're

911
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
No, The Club, their shooter that wasn't

912
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Quite good

913
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And of course, James Bond

914
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Bloodstone, which

915
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Not very good, but it also has some driving in there

916
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But driving apparently is better than the Bond game

917
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Anyhow

918
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So they're getting closed down

919
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Because apparently

920
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
They aren't making enough money for their pimps

921
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
At Activision

922
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And

923
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Apparently they're giving them a 90 day period

924
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Which I guess

925
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Is serving as notice to the

926
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Employees that their company is likely to be

927
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Closed, sold, downsized, etc.

928
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And apparently

929
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Activision says over the past three years since

930
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Our purchase of Bizarre Creations

931
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The fundamentals of racing genres

932
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Have significantly changed

933
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Although we

934
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Made a substantial investment

935
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
In creating a new IP

936
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Blur

937
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It did not find a

938
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Commercial audience

939
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Mind you, that they're

940
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Still keeping the Tony Hawk

941
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Ride franchise around

942
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Even though that's

943
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Incredibly terrible

944
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But, you know, Blur

945
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
A racing game that probably had a decent

946
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Following, just not exactly, you know

947
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Tony Hawk

948
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Ride numbers, maybe

949
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Which I do know that they sold more than Tony Hawk

950
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Ride, by the way

951
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And then of course

952
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Other developers and whatever

953
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And there is a chance though

954
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That they may be purchased by somebody else

955
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Obviously

956
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Because Project Gotham Racer is an awesome

957
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Series

958
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's funny how they sucked when they were bought

959
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
By Activision, but they were still pretty awesome

960
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
When they were with Microsoft

961
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Could it happen to be maybe

962
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Activision is to blame?

963
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Hey Jamie, knock knock

964
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Who's there? Interrupting cow

965
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Boo!

966
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That's all I know how to do is interrupt people

967
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Well you weren't

968
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Listening, obviously, because you're like

969
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Hey, guess what

970
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Geometry Wars was awesome

971
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Hey, listen

972
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I just feel, you know, that's

973
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Right, it was an awesome game

974
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But it wasn't an awesome racing game

975
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Which is what I was talking about

976
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Well maybe it should have been

977
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Maybe they should have had Geometry Wars racing

978
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Blur was actually kind of like that

979
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
A little bit

980
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Shoot him up and the whole little like

981
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Art thing going on with it

982
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Honestly, when I saw Blur

983
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I couldn't get

984
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It wasn't very interesting to me

985
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
SplitSecond was more interesting to me

986
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And, well, part of the problem with Blur

987
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Is that it came out like the same week

988
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
As SplitSecond

989
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
ModNation Racers

990
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And, you know, while Mario Kart is still selling big

991
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You know, and

992
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's just kind of unfortunate, but

993
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't know

994
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Does our creations really deserve to bite the bullet

995
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't know

996
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I think you hit the nail on the head

997
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
They were doing fine until Activision bought them

998
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Well, Activision, they're like

999
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Hey, you know, we need you to make some better stuff

1000
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So we're going to have you do a James Bond game

1001
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Honestly

1002
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I can't think of a James Bond game

1003
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Since Goldeneye that has sold well

1004
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And those are the ones

1005
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Normally based off movies

1006
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
This was based off of nothing

1007
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So, their excuse was

1008
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Well, you know, since there's a lawsuit

1009
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Going on right now with the James Bond

1010
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Licensing and stuff

1011
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So, hey, this is the closest thing

1012
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You're going to get to a new movie

1013
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Well, that's great and all

1014
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Except no one cares

1015
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And

1016
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I don't know

1017
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It was just a terrible idea

1018
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Another company

1019
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Also taking some cuts

1020
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Thanks to Activision is Budcat

1021
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And Budcat

1022
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Of course, they were

1023
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
One of the developers that was acquired

1024
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
To work on a Guitar Hero franchise

1025
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And of course, it says

1026
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Approximately 88 positions

1027
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Or approximately 1%

1028
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Of our global workforce has been

1029
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Affected by the layoffs

1030
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So that's

1031
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
1% is not bad, I guess

1032
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It says Budcat though

1033
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Is comprised of roughly 60 people

1034
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So

1035
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I don't know

1036
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's interesting, I guess they were saying

1037
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
They're doing

1038
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They're targeting

1039
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Reduction in jobs

1040
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
For its QA department

1041
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I guess that makes sense

1042
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because, I mean, they hire

1043
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And fire people for QA all the time

1044
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Based on

1045
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You know, the games that are coming out

1046
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Although

1047
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Some of those games

1048
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Probably should keep the QA department

1049
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Around a little bit longer

1050
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Not necessarily just with Activision

1051
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But companies like Bethesda

1052
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Might learn too

1053
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
By keeping more QA around

1054
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You won't release buggy ass games

1055
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Like Fallout New Vegas

1056
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And Activision, they're saying

1057
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
We continue to streamline our music

1058
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Development resources to ensure that

1059
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
They are aligned against our slate

1060
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And strategic goals

1061
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
As a result, we are implementing

1062
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
A targeted reduction in jobs

1063
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
In our QA team in California

1064
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And closing our Budcat studio

1065
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
In Iowa

1066
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Budcat has a great partner to Activision

1067
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And has created a lasting impact

1068
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
On the Guitar Hero franchise

1069
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Honestly, I think what this is coming around to

1070
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Is that before they had

1071
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
One team developing stuff

1072
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
For Guitar Hero

1073
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And then they acquired a few more studios

1074
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
To do stuff for Guitar Hero

1075
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And now that they're reducing the amount of games

1076
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
They're releasing each year

1077
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
From Metallica's, Van Halen's

1078
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And whatnot

1079
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
They don't need that many development teams anymore

1080
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Because they're going to be releasing

1081
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
One Guitar Hero game a year

1082
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Approximately

1083
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I hate to say it because it's never happy news

1084
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
To report on game studios closing

1085
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But unlike the last one, this one makes a little more sense

1086
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We know there's been too much saturation

1087
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Of the Guitar Hero games

1088
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So to hear that one of the studios that's been making

1089
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
All these unnecessary ports

1090
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Sorry, that's how I feel

1091
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That shutting down makes more sense

1092
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Than the last one you reported on

1093
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Especially with the story we're going to get into here in a minute

1094
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Which you know is not inevitable

1095
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
About the music games kind of

1096
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Slowing down as it is

1097
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I don't know if they are slowing down

1098
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I think

1099
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
People have their expectations

1100
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Wrong on some of these games

1101
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But we'll get into that

1102
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
A little bit later

1103
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I just don't agree with

1104
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What they're saying

1105
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
LucasArts, another company that's not Activision

1106
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Is also confirming layoffs

1107
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And they're saying that they're

1108
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Committing

1109
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
To their internal development

1110
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And they're saying that recently

1111
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
They've made minor adjustments in staffing

1112
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And that

1113
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It will help them better address

1114
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The needs of the business

1115
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And they're remaining

1116
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
They remain committed to

1117
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Their internal studio

1118
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And fostering relationships with trusted

1119
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
internal partners in order to develop blah blah blah

1120
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
In other words

1121
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
They just let some people go

1122
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Outsource

1123
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And of course

1124
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
They had let go

1125
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Some of their staff

1126
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Earlier

1127
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
This year as well

1128
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Back in September

1129
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I guess

1130
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
This is

1131
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I don't know if it's necessarily

1132
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
To do with poor sales in different games

1133
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Or whatnot but honestly

1134
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
LucasArts doesn't have

1135
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
A lot of games coming out each year

1136
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's maybe one or two titles a year so

1137
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I don't know

1138
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's kind of to be expected I guess

1139
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Since they just finished a big title

1140
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah I guess

1141
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Still kind of sucks but

1142
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Okay

1143
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
What's going to happen when they run out of Star Wars games to make?

1144
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't think they ever will

1145
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
They never will

1146
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Besides they have the huge MMO coming out

1147
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Of Bioware but whatever

1148
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And then finally

1149
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
745 Studios

1150
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The company behind the

1151
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Well the game

1152
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
PowerGig

1153
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
They also said that they are

1154
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Linging off people

1155
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Apparently

1156
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Approximately 20 to 30 people were let go

1157
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Most of which were in the QA team

1158
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And a bunch of full time staff

1159
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And of course

1160
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
They're saying that

1161
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
With the gig already on the store shelves

1162
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Last week's 745 Studios restructured

1163
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
The company is both a part of the

1164
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Natural cycle in game development and the focus

1165
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
On the development needs of its upcoming game projects

1166
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Also the fact that

1167
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Their games scored really poor

1168
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Or really poorly

1169
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
As far as reviews go

1170
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Was not a good game unfortunately

1171
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And this is the studio

1172
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Thanks to everyone who contributed to their first game

1173
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
PowerGig Rise of the Sixth Stream

1174
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And we wish the individuals impacted by the reorganization

1175
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
All the best

1176
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So yeah lots of people getting let going

1177
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Right before the holidays

1178
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I feel like this is like an echo of what happened last year

1179
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
This is sad but I mean it's kind of a

1180
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I guess it's to be expected

1181
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But it doesn't

1182
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
These are the folks that bring our games

1183
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Well I think it makes sense because if you think about it

1184
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Maybe these games

1185
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
For some of these smaller companies

1186
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Not necessarily Activision and Bazaar

1187
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And stuff like that

1188
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's like 745 I would think

1189
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
That they're developing the game and stuff

1190
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
They don't really need a large QA team until they're getting

1191
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The product all fleshed out

1192
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And then they're gonna hire people in

1193
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And unfortunately QA

1194
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
A lot of the testers and stuff

1195
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's not as glamorous

1196
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
As the tester would like you

1197
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
To think

1198
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's really just like

1199
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Minimum wage

1200
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Shit job that you take

1201
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And you get hired and fired

1202
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Pretty regularly

1203
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So it's not a big shock

1204
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah I mean I hate to say it

1205
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But especially when you consider

1206
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That Power Gig has come out now

1207
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And it's kind of landed with this big

1208
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Unfortunately

1209
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It makes this news

1210
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
A lot less surprising

1211
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But again

1212
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It is better than Rock Revolution

1213
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah but a studio like Konami

1214
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Can kind of take the blunt

1215
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Of some of that

1216
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Studio Closure's economy too

1217
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I mean they closed one of their big offices

1218
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I think two actually

1219
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Well Hawaii had closed at one point

1220
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And then they had the Bay Area one closed

1221
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So I mean it's not like even the big companies are immune

1222
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
To this sort of thing

1223
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But you know I don't like to report on people losing their jobs

1224
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
As happy happy

1225
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But I think that the silver lining to this

1226
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Is that you know

1227
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
For I hate to sound like such a dork

1228
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But you know for every door that closes another opens

1229
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But especially in the gaming world

1230
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They will be on their way out

1231
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Well I don't think, well we're going to get into that in a minute

1232
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But they're not what they were before

1233
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Something new will come to take its place

1234
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You know we're not looking at another

1235
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Huge video game crash

1236
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Or there's going to be no jobs in gaming whatsoever

1237
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I think there will be other opportunities

1238
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That just might not be the same type of game

1239
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Or the same studio as before

1240
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So hopefully these guys land on their feet somewhere else

1241
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You know what I mean

1242
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Like there wouldn't have been a Power Gig in the first place

1243
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
If Guitar Hero and Rock Band hadn't done so well, right?

1244
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah, so

1245
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Anyhow, I guess I've referenced this enough

1246
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
But you might have been reading some stories this week

1247
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It is being reported that music game sales

1248
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Are continuing a downward trend

1249
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's an analysis that was originally published by Gamasutra

1250
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They were looking at the period of January through October

1251
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
For the past three years

1252
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Looking at music game revenues

1253
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Apparently it was $1.6 billion in 2008

1254
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And where they are today, under $250 million for the year so far

1255
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And they say short of a Christmas miracle

1256
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Music games won't break $400 million for all of 2010

1257
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So that would be what, a quarter of where they were in 2008?

1258
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So

1259
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
While that is kind of sad

1260
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I also kind of go back and say

1261
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Okay, well wait a minute

1262
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
2007 was the first year that Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 came out?

1263
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So

1264
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
To go January-October of 2008

1265
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
That was the period when everybody was playing it over at their friends' houses

1266
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And all that

1267
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah, and

1268
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I don't know, I mean

1269
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
With Rock Band at least, they didn't have to sell software

1270
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
They were selling download content

1271
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Now I'm not really sure if that counts download content

1272
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
As part of that revenue

1273
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
But that's where all their money's been made lately

1274
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's not been with new games

1275
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I mean, yeah, they just released a new game

1276
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
But it's been out for maybe

1277
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Not even a month yet

1278
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Well, actually just slightly over a month

1279
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But

1280
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't know, it's hard to say that

1281
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's dying

1282
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I think a lot of people are like

1283
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Maybe they don't need the keyboard peripheral

1284
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Maybe they're happy with the hundreds of songs

1285
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That they have in Rock Band 2

1286
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Here's my thought though

1287
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And I'm gonna bring this full circle

1288
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Watch

1289
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
To say that music games are declining

1290
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And on their way out the door

1291
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Is an extremely ignorant statement to me

1292
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Because it's no different than

1293
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Remember earlier in the show when you were speaking about

1294
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Guwang

1295
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And you were saying it was like every other cave shooter

1296
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And somebody took issue with that

1297
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
For me, it's very similar to what's happening here with music games

1298
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I don't think the period of music games

1299
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Means the period of plastic guitars

1300
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And plastic drums

1301
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Is satiating

1302
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
There's not anything else you can really do

1303
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
With this

1304
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I mean, Rock Band 3 is trying with the keyboards

1305
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And so forth, but it's unfortunately

1306
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Not really gonna be enough

1307
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That doesn't mean music games are dead

1308
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Look at Dance Central

1309
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I can say pretty confidently

1310
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's the best selling Kinect game right now

1311
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That isn't the one that's packaged in

1312
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
With the Kinect

1313
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Probably the two big ones

1314
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Still though, to be doing that well

1315
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Kinda shows that maybe there's a future there

1316
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And maybe other types of music games

1317
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That haven't quite been thought of yet

1318
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Believe me guys, we've been following music games

1319
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
For a very long time here on OLR

1320
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Here's a perfect example

1321
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Ten years ago it was DDR

1322
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Before that, even Parappa the Rappa

1323
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Busta

1324
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Just all these other games

1325
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Perfect example, what do you think the top Wii title was for October?

1326
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
For October, the top Wii title?

1327
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Probably, it's still Wii Play

1328
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
No

1329
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And you would think, maybe it might be Kirby's

1330
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You know, the

1331
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Epic Yarn or whatever

1332
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It's gonna be something a lot more

1333
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Like every

1334
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Adult picks it up for the family

1335
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's gonna be something family

1336
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's a Wii Party

1337
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Just Dance 2

1338
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Okay

1339
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Not too surprised, okay

1340
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And not even close for second place

1341
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Just Dance 2

1342
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
For the month of October

1343
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And this is since it was released

1344
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Cause I believe it came out the second or third week

1345
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Of October

1346
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It sold 285,556 units

1347
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Compare that with second place

1348
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Which would've been

1349
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Wii Fit Plus

1350
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
With Balance Board

1351
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Cause you know those games

1352
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You know, Ten to Sell

1353
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And Wii Party of course

1354
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Wii Fit Plus 89,000

1355
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So it

1356
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Oversold it by more than double

1357
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And same with

1358
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Wii Party

1359
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It was 92,000

1360
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
So

1361
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You know

1362
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You can't really see that the music genre is dead

1363
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Because these games are just doing

1364
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Crazy well

1365
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Just Dance, the first one

1366
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Number 8 for October

1367
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And it sold actually

1368
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I just wanna say real quick

1369
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
To be fair in the Gamasutra

1370
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And I'm not interrupting you, I promise

1371
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
To be fair in the original Gamasutra report

1372
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
They are acknowledging that Dance Central

1373
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Could be a new opportunity for where this is going

1374
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But nowhere in this report does it mention

1375
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Just Dance

1376
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It should, and here's another cool fact

1377
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
You know

1378
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Games like Wii Fit

1379
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And stuff like that

1380
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Sold a lot

1381
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Four million copies

1382
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
From launch to date

1383
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Some other stuff

1384
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Real quick, I'm trying to find another game that would have been

1385
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Like a real big one here

1386
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Let's see here

1387
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Okay, here we go

1388
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Metroid Other M

1389
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You know, I guess that's kind of a poor comparison

1390
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Because it didn't do well all the way

1391
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Well yeah, Reggie acknowledged it's not

1392
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
187,000 life

1393
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
From launch

1394
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Okay, here we go, here we go

1395
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
How about like a Mario Party 8

1396
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
See that did 3.2 million

1397
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Launch to date

1398
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And you know

1399
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
The

1400
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Just Dance series, the first one

1401
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Did actually

1402
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Pretty well, I mean within a year

1403
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It has sold almost 2 million units

1404
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
1.8 million units

1405
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
In closing, and here's kind of my closing thought

1406
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
With this, this whole report here

1407
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Does not really sound like

1408
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
A referendum on music games

1409
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So much as it is a referendum on

1410
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Harmonics, and maybe trying to make sense

1411
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Of why Viacom suddenly wants to

1412
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Unload them, because

1413
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Even though it's talking about Guitar Hero and Rock Band

1414
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm sorry, Guitar Hero was still a

1415
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Harmonics franchise

1416
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yes, it's been turned over to somebody else since then

1417
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
But Harmonics made that first game

1418
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That everything else has been modeled after

1419
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Everything that's happened

1420
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
In the Guitar Hero franchise has been a rip-off

1421
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Of something Harmonics has done

1422
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Since Harmonics left the building, right?

1423
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Is that really an unfair thing to say?

1424
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
No

1425
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So this is more speaking to, in my opinion

1426
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Harmonics

1427
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Than it is music games

1428
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Because nowhere in here are we talking about

1429
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The Just Dances of the World or the

1430
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You know, Konami, DDR

1431
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Which I'm sure is really nothing to scream about

1432
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But it's still out there cooking

1433
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And it's poking along

1434
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Unfortunately, that is the future of Rock Band

1435
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It's going to be like the

1436
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
DDR releases

1437
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It's going to have its loyal following forever and ever

1438
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And it will still get its yearly releases

1439
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
But they're going to, unfortunately, probably

1440
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Be a little more and more meh

1441
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
But here's the thing, I think Harmonics

1442
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Is a studio that knows better

1443
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And will continue to innovate and such

1444
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Like they're trying to do with Dance Central

1445
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Which, you know, it seems to be working out

1446
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Well for them, and who knows whatever else

1447
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
They're going to bring out in the future

1448
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Maybe something else connect, maybe that whole

1449
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Rumored revival of the amplitude frequency

1450
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Style game, who knows

1451
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Anyhow

1452
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Maybe I've spoken too long on this, I don't know

1453
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
But if you want to join us in our chatroom

1454
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com

1455
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Some folks talking about Dance Masters

1456
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And maybe arcade games

1457
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya

1458
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Saying, so if Konami could get with them

1459
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
To put out Dance Masters, they could put it in arcades

1460
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Oh, Izzam says

1461
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Music games aren't out the door

1462
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
They're just not the cash cow everyone wanted them to be

1463
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
They were for a while

1464
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
You know, I could see, see that's

1465
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
One thing that's kind of cool about the Kinect

1466
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And the way it's set up, is

1467
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
An arcade release wouldn't be that

1468
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Difficult for them

1469
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I mean seriously, since there's no controller involved

1470
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You just use the same damn technology

1471
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And away you go

1472
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Nothing like this lasts forever

1473
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Any type of fad in gaming

1474
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Or really anything it is

1475
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Movies even, nothing like this lasts forever

1476
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Like, remember teen comedies

1477
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
When American Pie came out

1478
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
We had every teen

1479
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Comedy in the world came out

1480
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Over the next couple years

1481
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And then suddenly, they didn't all start doing well

1482
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It doesn't mean teen comedies are gone forever

1483
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But it's just you don't see as many of them

1484
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Right? Or if they did come out

1485
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
They're not the gross out

1486
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Stuff like American Pie was

1487
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
People, they try to

1488
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
You know, they try to figure out what the trends are

1489
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
There's certain companies that will

1490
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Create those trends

1491
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And then there's other companies that will try to mimic

1492
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Those trends

1493
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And try to capitalize on them

1494
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And some of them do a good job of it

1495
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Like for example, when Activision

1496
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
When Guitar Hero first came out

1497
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That was a good franchise

1498
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And then you had EA come out with

1499
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Rockband, of course both developed by the same company

1500
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
But it kind of

1501
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
You know, was taking

1502
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Some of the thunder from

1503
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Guitar Hero, but then improved upon it

1504
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It's hard though right now

1505
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Because it's hard to improve upon

1506
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
What they've already got

1507
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
With what's out there as far as

1508
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
The peripherals go

1509
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And really, how much more can you do

1510
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Other than adding new instruments

1511
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
To make these games any more

1512
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Unique or exciting or whatever

1513
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I mean, other than the song list

1514
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I guess in peripherals, it would just be

1515
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
There's not much you can do with it

1516
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It hasn't been thought of yet

1517
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Who knew three years ago

1518
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
We would be looking at a game like Dance Central

1519
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I don't think any of us could have predicted that

1520
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Um

1521
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Especially with the iToy stuff

1522
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It just didn't work well

1523
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It just didn't work well before

1524
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And I think a lot of us wrote it off then

1525
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
As the trend that was going to go away

1526
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
You know what I mean?

1527
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Oh, we saw this done on the iToy

1528
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And it was kind of ridiculous at best

1529
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So, bye

1530
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So who knew that the technology would be there later on

1531
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You know, perfect example of people trying to capitalize on this stuff

1532
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
They have

1533
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's funny

1534
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
They actually have another dance game

1535
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
For the Kinect that we haven't really heard of

1536
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Because it's only in the European markets

1537
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Dance Paradise

1538
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah, I remember a story on this one had come up briefly

1539
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Didn't look very good

1540
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Kind of similar to

1541
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It reminds me a little bit of Dance Masters

1542
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
But like, really dumbed down

1543
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Because it has all your

1544
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Avatar characters dancing around

1545
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Well, and you, me, and her can't exactly run over to Target

1546
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And get a copy of that

1547
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Exactly

1548
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And then the other thing too

1549
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Is the star plus dance

1550
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Something else that they're trying to capitalize on

1551
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
The whole Just Dance and Dance Central stuff

1552
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
But it's just not done well

1553
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And the problem is you're going to get a lot of these companies

1554
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Especially if Dance Central does really, really well

1555
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
They're going to release their dance games

1556
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
They're just going to be

1557
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Probably terrible

1558
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I bet you anything

1559
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Dance Central does really well

1560
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Well, we've already got the trademark for Dance Hero

1561
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
How much you want to bet?

1562
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Alright, I want to say this real quick comment

1563
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
From our good pal Bobby Blackwolf

1564
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Is in the chat

1565
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I want the inevitable Glee ripoff

1566
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Based on a marching band

1567
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Someone make this trend happen

1568
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That is one trend I'm not looking forward to

1569
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Is all the Glee ripoffs coming next season

1570
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
By the way, because you know

1571
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
The Glee game, Karaoke Revolution

1572
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I mentioned that there was a sequel on the way

1573
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
V2

1574
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Road to, what was it?

1575
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Road to Regionals is the

1576
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
The name

1577
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Will it have Teenage Dream in it?

1578
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Can't wait

1579
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yay, now I know what to buy Dark Sakura

1580
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
For Christmas, except she'll throw it at me

1581
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Or Hanukkah, excuse me

1582
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Chrismica

1583
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
If I bought you Glee the video game on Wii

1584
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
How quick would I be wearing the box?

1585
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I don't know

1586
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I'd have to actually get Becky over here to play it

1587
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I wouldn't play it

1588
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
But she loves Glee, so I would let her play it

1589
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And then I would go

1590
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Trade it in and get a good game

1591
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But see, that's what Karaoke Revolution

1592
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Has become to

1593
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Konami

1594
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I don't think they take it seriously anymore

1595
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Well, I'm gonna get more attention to this

1596
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I know, let's attach

1597
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Glee to it

1598
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I know, let's attach American Idol

1599
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
To it

1600
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
How long

1601
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I can tell you how long

1602
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It's because once that show actually launches

1603
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
How long are we gonna have Karaoke Revolution

1604
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
X Factor edition

1605
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I mean, seriously

1606
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
That's gonna be the next thing they have

1607
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Alright

1608
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Let's move on, we gotta talk about something

1609
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Not music games, so hopefully Dark Sakura

1610
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Can help us out, do you have a non-music game story for us?

1611
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Remember that thing that we

1612
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Were wondering if ever would come out

1613
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And it looks like it finally is, and maybe people

1614
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Care? Duke Nukem Forever?

1615
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Gran Turismo 5

1616
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Well, actually

1617
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It's gonna have a feature where you don't

1618
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Have to load the whole thing onto your

1619
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Hard drive, which is actually supposed to take

1620
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
About 40 minutes to do

1621
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Wow

1622
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Yeah, it needs 6.4 gigabytes

1623
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Of hard drive space

1624
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Um

1625
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
But what you can do is you can actually just

1626
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Opt not to and let stuff

1627
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Load as it will, but what it does

1628
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
As it loads is that it loads

1629
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
What you're playing

1630
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Onto your hard drive, so you're

1631
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Installing it in fragments

1632
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So it's

1633
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Copying over what you need

1634
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
For that particular race

1635
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Exactly, and of course

1636
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You know, say that you do new content

1637
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Well, you've got

1638
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
That going on, and then say you go back

1639
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
To an old race, well it's already there, you don't have to worry about waiting

1640
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
For it to really load

1641
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Because it'll be going off hard drive

1642
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Interesting, and I wonder if it, does it use any

1643
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Idle times? I don't know if this is even out there

1644
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Or not, like while you're on menus and stuff

1645
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Maybe to be doing some of the loading as well?

1646
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Um, sure it will be

1647
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Interesting

1648
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
But the number of cars is listed on here

1649
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
As 1031 cars

1650
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And that's pretty crazy

1651
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
That's a lot of cars

1652
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yeah

1653
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It's actually the largest install

1654
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
That's gonna be on PS3

1655
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I mean, other big ones were

1656
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Devil May Cry

1657
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And Endwar

1658
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And Bioshock 2 and Lost Planet

1659
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
They were around the five gig

1660
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Four and a half, five gig range

1661
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And this is 6.4

1662
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So it's big

1663
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And for our European listeners it will be out

1664
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
On November 24th

1665
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
That's an eventual

1666
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
That's also for us, yeah

1667
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
The worldwide launch thing

1668
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I was confirming

1669
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Men

1670
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Are you gonna pick it up?

1671
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Is it a game that interests you?

1672
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Probably, though I won't, Dan will get it

1673
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Okay

1674
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
He's the one who sits here and waits for

1675
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
All the new episodes of Top Gear to come out so he can

1676
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Watch them on the internet

1677
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So, oh give me that

1678
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I'm trying to open this new little

1679
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Toy I bought, sorry

1680
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Dark Soccer is using her nails

1681
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Maybe, maybe scissors?

1682
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I don't know, alright, anyhow, let's move on

1683
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
More news, nobody wants to hear about my package

1684
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Opening drama, except for the fact, why do they

1685
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Make packages so difficult to open?

1686
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So people can't steal. Loss prevention

1687
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Still

1688
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And because they're so fragile

1689
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Just have the cameras and the beepers

1690
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah, of course that never works either, the beepers

1691
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Always go off even when I legitimately

1692
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Bought them

1693
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Just to let everyone know I'm using the scissors

1694
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I stole from work

1695
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
From the place of which I am officially

1696
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
No longer employed

1697
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Way to stick it to them

1698
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh yeah, I'll take some scissors

1699
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Sure

1700
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
So we were talking a little bit about the

1701
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Connect and Dance Central and stuff

1702
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Well Connect has actually sold pretty well

1703
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It's already moved a million units in the first ten days

1704
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And they're saying it's on track to hit their goal

1705
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Of five million this year

1706
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I have a little problem with that

1707
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Because

1708
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
GameStop and

1709
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Me personally

1710
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Based off of what I've seen coming from Microsoft

1711
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
They're saying there's shortages

1712
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Of this

1713
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You know, Connect hardware

1714
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So I'd be surprised

1715
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
If they hit five million by the end of this year

1716
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Because what we see coming

1717
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Is definitely not

1718
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You know, a lot

1719
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Is it really shortage time?

1720
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because when I was at Best Buy the other day, they had plenty

1721
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Well that's what GameStop's saying

1722
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
They're saying it's hard to get

1723
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And I think that you're gonna see

1724
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It may be hard to find right now

1725
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Because they're holding them back for Black Friday

1726
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I don't know

1727
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I just know that there's a lot of them

1728
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
On eBay going over retail

1729
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But people are crazy

1730
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And of course they're gonna say

1731
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh yeah, it's hard to get

1732
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
But you know

1733
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It's gonna be one of the must have things

1734
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Definitely this holiday

1735
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So

1736
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
You know, if you're interested in buying one

1737
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And especially if you're looking

1738
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
To put it under the Christmas tree

1739
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Or in a stocking

1740
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Or whether festive

1741
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Kind of a big thing to put in a stocking

1742
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
That's a really big sock

1743
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Really big stockings

1744
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
If it's something

1745
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
You're looking to purchase

1746
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
For Christmas or a holiday or whatever

1747
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Give as a gift

1748
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
You probably want to start looking now

1749
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Don't wait till the last minute

1750
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Alright

1751
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Well if they don't meet their numbers because of shortages

1752
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Then that's their own damn fault

1753
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
How can you predict that you're gonna sell five million

1754
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Yet know at the same time you're not gonna make that many

1755
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
They said three to five was their original expense

1756
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Now we're downplaying it a little bit

1757
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Alright

1758
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
We'll see

1759
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I don't think they're going to

1760
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Here's the real message on everyone's mind

1761
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
How's this doing compared to the move?

1762
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I don't know

1763
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I know Sony put out something and said

1764
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Oh yeah the move's done well

1765
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Fortunately the NPD and stuff

1766
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
They don't really track

1767
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Accessory sales

1768
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Which is what this would be kind of considered

1769
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I guess

1770
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So I don't know

1771
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Maybe we'll find out in a future episode

1772
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Alright well moving on to some news

1773
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
About Marvel vs. Capcom 3

1774
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
We have a release date for the game

1775
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So I know this is something

1776
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Dark Sakura's gonna pick up

1777
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Or make Dan get for her

1778
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
What a perfect opportunity

1779
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Dark Sakura just in time for Valentine's Day

1780
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Actually a little bit late

1781
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
February 15th, 2011

1782
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So if you're willing to put Valentine's Day on hold

1783
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
By one day you can make it of

1784
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Marvel meets Capcom and falls in love day

1785
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
You know what?

1786
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
We typically play games on Valentine's Day

1787
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
So he can get me that

1788
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Instead of a bunch of roses

1789
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I don't care

1790
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
At least he won't bitch about how much this costs

1791
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Instead of the roses

1792
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Just dip the box in chocolate

1793
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Yes to be fair this game would probably be cheaper than the roses

1794
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You know I always tell him that I want one

1795
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And he buys me a dozen

1796
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And I'm like, dude I want one

1797
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Maybe he thinks you mean one dozen

1798
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Maybe one doesn't

1799
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Alright the game is coming out

1800
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It's gonna be out on February 15th, 2011

1801
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
On the 360 and the Playstation 3

1802
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Europe you have to wait just a few more days

1803
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So you might have to make it Valentine's week

1804
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
February 18th is the day for you guys

1805
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
There is a regular and special edition

1806
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And the special edition will cost you

1807
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
70 bucks

1808
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Now in the news of more characters

1809
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
There are some more characters announced for the game

1810
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
She-Hulk and Zero

1811
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3

1812
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I love She-Hulk, she's so awesome

1813
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
She-Hulk is female Hulk

1814
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And Zero of course is from the Mega Man franchise

1815
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I wonder if she's also gonna

1816
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Break the fourth wall since they're letting Deadpool do it

1817
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Why not?

1818
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Well she does it in her own comic too

1819
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I don't see why they wouldn't

1820
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Be a good thing to do there

1821
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So those characters are coming out

1822
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I believe I was reading something about

1823
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
They're the special edition characters too

1824
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
So if you want all the characters

1825
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You gotta shout out the extra money

1826
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Oh no, I take that back

1827
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Jill Valentine is one of the special characters

1828
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And Shumagrath

1829
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I have to tell you

1830
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
We always call Shumagrath Shumachan

1831
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Because apparently Shumagrath is supposed to be

1832
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Female but also a really bad tentacle rate monster

1833
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Seriously, Shumagrath

1834
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Is this giant eyeball with a bunch of tentacles

1835
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Alright

1836
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I was gonna say

1837
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Maybe a boss monster, but I guess it's not

1838
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Shumagrath was also in

1839
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Kinda like Medusa on crack

1840
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
It was in

1841
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Marvel Superheroes vs Street Fighter

1842
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
So there you go

1843
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
In the special edition we'll also

1844
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Get you exclusive

1845
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Artwork, a steel book case

1846
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
A one month

1847
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Subscription to Marvel's online digital

1848
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Comic service, that's kinda interesting

1849
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And a prologue comic that will be 12

1850
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Pages that will explain

1851
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Why there's a contest between these two

1852
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Universes, so they're gonna retcon this whole

1853
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Thing in which I'm sure will also be explained in the

1854
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Intro

1855
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But comics are different

1856
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So there you go

1857
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Remember, that comic will probably be

1858
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Scanned and put online immediately

1859
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I'm actually dying to know from Dark

1860
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Sakura since this is kinda part of the world she lives

1861
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
In, how do you feel about the digital comic

1862
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Being a pack

1863
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
In? I mean, do digital comics cut it

1864
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
For you, or no thank you, I want

1865
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Books? Well

1866
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Given that I read a lot of my comics

1867
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Digitally anyway, it's just fine by me

1868
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Um, actually

1869
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Tiara and I share a

1870
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Subscription to Marvel digital comics

1871
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Oh, very cool

1872
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Yeah, so

1873
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It's mostly old comics

1874
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
And a lot of them actually do have in print

1875
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
But it's still pretty cool

1876
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And I've always

1877
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Did it say that

1878
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
It was just a digital comic or one of the

1879
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Motion

1880
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Comics? It's the

1881
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Subscription to their digital comic service

1882
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
But I mean, they say that they were

1883
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
That they were gonna release another

1884
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Comic

1885
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I think the actual comic book that comes with it

1886
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The prologue comic is a physical comic book

1887
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Oh, see, that I want

1888
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Oh, nevermind, I misunderstood, I thought

1889
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Okay, so you have a digital comic and a

1890
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It's MODOK! Sorry

1891
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I was looking back at the video and I was like

1892
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Ah, MODOK

1893
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It's gonna be a fun fighting game, looking forward to it

1894
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I'm looking forward to it, and you know what, I love the little touches

1895
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Because I've been going back and watching movies

1896
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
With characters, just to check

1897
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Authenticity

1898
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And there's been some pretty neat little touches in there

1899
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Now Marvel, I'm really happy for you

1900
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And I'm gonna let you finish

1901
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
But Capcom vs. SNK

1902
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Was the best crossover fighting game of all time

1903
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So I'm looking forward to maybe that being next year

1904
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Just saying

1905
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
More news stories

1906
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
And then release dates coming up in just one moment

1907
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Dark Sakura

1908
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Well, in other news, we have

1909
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
A bit of a cost

1910
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Issue with development on the 3DS

1911
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
It's going

1912
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
To be expensive

1913
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
As in, probably three times

1914
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
As expensive

1915
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
As doing other

1916
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
DS, as doing DS games

1917
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
One times expensive for every dimension

1918
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yeah

1919
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
They're basically saying between

1920
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
50 million and 150 million yen

1921
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Per

1922
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
3DS title

1923
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
So, um

1924
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That's a lot of money

1925
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It's going to

1926
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Pretty much, like, here's

1927
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
An example

1928
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Gaming

1929
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Actually reported that

1930
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Japanese studios spend between 4.4 million

1931
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And 43.9 million on a DS title

1932
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And we're talking

1933
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
50 million

1934
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
To 150 million yen

1935
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Yikes

1936
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That's a lot of money

1937
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Yeah, and just to put that

1938
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Into perspective

1939
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
At least for our UK listeners

1940
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
They're spending roughly 33,000

1941
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
To 333,000 pounds

1942
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And then

1943
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
The estimated cost

1944
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Is going to be

1945
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
A lot

1946
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
A lot

1947
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Well, now, there's a part of me that wants to say, well, duh

1948
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
You know, new system, new expenses

1949
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
DS has been out a while

1950
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
So, of course, it's cheap, and this is going to be new

1951
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
But

1952
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
There was a call

1953
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Especially when E3 was around

1954
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
That they were saying, it's going to be easy to develop for

1955
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Because it's just like

1956
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Developing for other Nintendo platforms

1957
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Ease and cost are two different things

1958
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I guess that's true, but

1959
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
They were saying, like, if your game at all

1960
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Is calculating a type of Z-axis

1961
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
To render 3D in a 2D

1962
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
TV, if you know what I mean

1963
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It's very easy to translate that into the 3DS

1964
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
And remember, they were showing those demos

1965
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Of the 8-bit games

1966
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That, you know, were redone

1967
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And not just 8-bit, but they had the Zelda

1968
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
All Green of Time was out there

1969
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And Star Fox was out there

1970
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I would imagine that they wouldn't be too difficult

1971
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
To develop that kind of stuff because all they have to

1972
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Really do is create a second virtual camera

1973
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
That's going to be, you know, one for each eye

1974
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And that's how you create your depth

1975
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
For rendering purposes, but

1976
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I don't know

1977
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
So I'm surprised to hear it's three

1978
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Times as much money

1979
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I mean, okay, a little bit more expensive

1980
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Perhaps that will

1981
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Stave off some of the

1982
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Shovelware that may appear on

1983
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
That platform

1984
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
That might be a nice side effect, but I sadly don't think

1985
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
You're right

1986
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
It's only a matter of time before those development

1987
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Costs come down, right?

1988
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
So

1989
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Well, as technology

1990
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Catches up with it too, I think

1991
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
But this is still

1992
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Mostly speculation, I think

1993
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
You know, once they actually get practical

1994
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Costs out of it, once it's in motion

1995
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Then we'll be looking at something a little different

1996
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Alright, well, we'll see

1997
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
We'll see if these, uh, spending

1998
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
The money was worth the effort in just a few months

1999
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I can't believe I'm saying, a few months?

2000
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
3DS is out for us all to

2001
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Consume. Alright, in the meantime, let's see

2002
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
What's coming out a little more

2003
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Sooner for us to consume

2004
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
That was the worst transition ever

2005
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Good one, you know we're going to have huge mungus

2006
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Lists

2007
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Anyhow, what's coming out of the

2008
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
US? Black Friday is right around the corner

2009
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Can't wait to see what Steam is selling

2010
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
On Black Friday. I was just telling Dan that earlier

2011
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Hey, apparently the whole

2012
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Game for Windows thing, 10 cents

2013
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
For Age of Empires 3 today, and I'm sure

2014
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
That's been everywhere, yeah

2015
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
But, it's Age of Empires 3

2016
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I have 0 cents interest in that game

2017
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I mean, I think it's great that there's bargain basement

2018
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But the game's like 5 years old

2019
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
No one cares anymore

2020
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Now that it's 10 cents, people do

2021
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Like, I could get a game for 10 cents

2022
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
It's 5 years old

2023
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It wasn't selling any copies anyway

2024
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Anyhow

2025
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Today, actually, marked the release

2026
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Of Raving Rabbids Travel in Time

2027
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
For the Nintendo Wii, as well as

2028
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Donkey Kong Country Returns, which I hear

2029
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Is pretty good

2030
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
That is also on the Wii

2031
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
This week, not a whole lot coming out, but some

2032
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Pretty cool stuff

2033
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Red Dead Redemption, the Undead Nightmare Collection

2034
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
On Xbox 360 and Playstation 3

2035
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
That is the Undead Nightmare expansion

2036
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Which brings a brand new single player

2037
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Campaign, as well as

2038
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
All the multiplayer

2039
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Expansions

2040
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
This can actually be played by itself

2041
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
So you don't need the original Red Dead

2042
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So if you're looking to play some online Red Dead Redemption

2043
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And you want to do it cheaper

2044
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
This is the way to go, because it's only 30 bucks

2045
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Hot Wheels

2046
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Track Attack on the Wii and DS

2047
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Actually kind of cool because you can

2048
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Build your own tracks with this one

2049
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And they have the 80's

2050
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Hot Wheel Orange Tracks

2051
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
With it, so you gotta love that

2052
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
This week also, the Rock Band 3 Pro Wireless Guitar

2053
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Is making its way out for 150 bucks

2054
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
That's on Playstation 3 and

2055
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
360

2056
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Silly Bands

2057
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
A game based off of Robert Vance

2058
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Awesome

2059
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
That's on Nintendo DS

2060
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Where all the shovelware lives

2061
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Challenge Me Brain Puzzles 2

2062
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
On Nintendo DS

2063
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
That looks terrible as well

2064
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Some re-releases

2065
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Looks like it's kind of capitalizing

2066
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Black Friday stuff

2067
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
They're re-releasing Enemy Territory

2068
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Quake Wars and Soul Calibur 4

2069
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
This is by a third party company

2070
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Which is why none of those are from the same

2071
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Publisher

2072
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
That's for 30 bucks

2073
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I think there's some more coming out later this week as well

2074
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Splatterhouse

2075
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

2076
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
This week

2077
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Include the original Splatterhouse game as well

2078
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
As kind of an unlockable bonus

2079
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
CSI Unsolved on Nintendo DS

2080
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000

To your DualShock 3 controller

2092
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Great

01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000

2094
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000

Double Agent

2097
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Man, some of these games are dirt cheap

2098
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I'm not sure if you're getting a great deal on this

2099
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
But that's on Xbox 360

2100
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Drawn to Life Collection

2101
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
A re-release of those two games

2102
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
That's on Nintendo DS

2103
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
To tie in with the new Disney movie

2104
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Disney's Tangled

2105
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000

2110
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000

Just to complete the experience

2124
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000

The standard and the limited edition

And that

2137
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Wraps up the week, of course it's kind of

2138
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Gonna be slowing down

2139
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Here quite a bit, so don't expect much

2140
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Coming soon

2141
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Alright, well we'll travel over to Japan and look at

2142
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
What's coming out of there, on the 360

This is from Cave, so you know

2146
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Where this is going, right Loki?

2147
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's a shooter game, but this is a

2148
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
You know, it's kind of like made for the 360

2149
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
So it's very purdy

2150
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Kind of looking at the graphics here

2151
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
So check that out, that is on the 360 this week

2152
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And that really is the big release in

2153
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Japan this week on the 360

2154
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
There is Shaun White skateboarding

2155
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
But no one curr

2156
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Alright, moving on to the PlayStation 3

2157
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
This week, Gran Turismo 5

2158
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Not only coming out here, but in Japan as well

2159
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So check that out if you like that stuff

2160
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Also, Pachipata 16

2161
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Gengita Paradise 2

2162
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Comes out this week

2163
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
From Irem

2164
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
And yeah, it's just pretty much

2165
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Chicks on the beach playing pachinko games

2166
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
That is literally what this game is

2167
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
But they're all like 3D rendered and shit

2168
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Look at this 3D rendering of pachinko machines

2169
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
It almost looks like a

2170
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Make your own pin

2171
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Type of mode, where you can put the pins wherever you want

2172
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I'm telling you, it's a big deal there

2173
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
There also is a

2174
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
PlayStation 3 bundle

2175
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
With the console coming out

2176
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
With the Gran Turismo bundled in

2177
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Because it's kind of a big deal in Japan

2178
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So look for that this week

2179
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Shaun White skateboarding as well, big deal

2180
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Trinity Zero comes out this week

2181
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
That's also a PlayStation 3 game

2182
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
That's coming from Koei

2183
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And this is like a swords and magic type of game

2184
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Kind of looks like you have a party of people

2185
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
But it looks to be a little bit more of like a

2186
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Action-y type of

2187
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Roleplaying game

2188
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
So that actually looks kind of rad

2189
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Is this coming out in the US as well?

2190
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Not this year, probably next year

2191
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
That might be one that you want to import

2192
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
For those of you that are big into importing

2193
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
But just be careful

2194
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
It's a lot of Japanese

2195
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
So if you don't know Japanese

2196
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
You might be screwed

2197
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000

Or are getting it here

2201
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I remember playing this one at E3

2202
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Just the hockey and dodgeball

2203
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And all that stuff pretty soon

2204
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000

2207
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Some of the standouts though

2208
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000

Also gets a price reduction

2222
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I don't think these are all

2223
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Games that you guys are going to be pre-ordering

2224
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
But lots of price reductions this week

Quite a few games this week

2227
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Also you have quite a few price reductions

2228
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000

01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000

2237
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I'm not

2238
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Let's go to Europe

2239
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Well actually there are quite a number of games

2240
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000

As we discussed earlier

2253
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Well that's the PlayStation 3 one

2254
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And actually there is a release on

2255
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
The 25th

2256
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Of course it's not a holiday for them there I think

2257
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Plus Island Freedom

2258
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
26th is Def Jam Rapstar

2259
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000

Tron Evolution which I'm looking forward to

2266
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So getting that

2267
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
And

2268
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
There's a bunch more

2269
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
There's also Venetica

2270
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And on the 30th

2271
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Super Meat Boy

2272
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Yeah Venetica is supposed to be coming over here in January

2273
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
So that should be cool

2274
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
You played the Daughter of the Devil

2275
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Yeah that actually looks pretty interesting

2276
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Because apparently

2277
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Death is real or not the Devil

2278
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Death

2279
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
The Daughter of Death

2280
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Close enough

2281
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Both begin with D

2282
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
That looks kind of interesting

2283
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Jimmy

2284
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Eh

2285
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
It does kind of have a bit of a

2286
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Fable vibe to it just in looks

2287
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Yeah

2288
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Cool

2289
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
That's it

2290
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
APB

2291
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
It's kind of funny because people were pissed off

2292
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
That this game actually kind of went under

2293
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Within about 3 months of its launch

2294
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And now it's been acquired by

2295
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Gamers First and they're relaunching

2296
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
As APB Reloaded

2297
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
In the first half of 2011

2298
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And what's kind of cool about it though

2299
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Is the game will actually be

2300
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
A free to play

2301
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Iteration of the game

2302
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
So lots of microtransactions

2303
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
As well but hey you know what

2304
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
That's awesome because

2305
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I would love that game to be free to play

2306
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It was pretty fun to begin with

2307
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
But I couldn't see myself paying for it

2308
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Thank God I was too lazy to pay for it

2309
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
This was a game that you were excited about

2310
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
But you were like too lazy to get

2311
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Right?

2312
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Exactly

2313
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Nice

2314
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Or as Rama says in our chat room

2315
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
APB rise from your grave

2316
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Get it?

2317
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Anyhow one more story

2318
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
For you guys and we're going to get to the classic game of the week

2319
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
But this is about a different type of classic

2320
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
On the Wii

2321
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
It's this whole super special

2322
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
25th anniversary edition here

2323
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
You know the Wii has

2324
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
The 25th anniversary Mario collection

2325
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
That comes with like a Mario collection

2326
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
And Wii Sports

2327
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And the red controllers and all that

2328
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Here's the interesting thing though

2329
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Is that in Europe they got the Wii

2330
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And it came with New Super Mario Brothers

2331
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And Donkey Kong original

2332
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Edition

2333
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
It was preloaded onto the Wii

2334
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
It was kind of like a virtual console game

2335
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Because you know how Donkey Kong was on the NES

2336
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Originally right?

2337
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Well here's the interesting thing

2338
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Donkey Kong original edition

2339
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
On the Wii that's coming out in Europe

2340
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Has the cement factory level

2341
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
And you might be going

2342
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Okay well who cares about that?

2343
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Well that's because the cement factory level

2344
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Wasn't in the NES version of

2345
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Donkey Kong

2346
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
So it's kind of weird because

2347
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It's very obvious I guess you can tell

2348
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
From the way this kind of looks when you're playing the game

2349
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
That it's not a port of the arcade game

2350
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
But it's actually like an NES ROM

2351
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
But it actually has the

2352
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Cement factory level in it

2353
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Which by the way I used to call the pie level

2354
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Because I'm the Commodore 64

2355
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
That for whatever reason

2356
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Are going into burning oil

2357
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Just roll with me here

2358
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So yeah kind of weird that

2359
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Nintendo either knowingly or unknowingly

2360
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Kind of dug out this prototype

2361
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Donkey Kong game

2362
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
That honestly never saw the light of day

2363
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
In either continent

2364
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I think that's kind of cool actually

2365
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I mean whereas a lot of people are going to look at this

2366
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
And go eh big deal a missing level shows up

2367
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
In a game that's like what 25 years old now

2368
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I kind of go wait a minute though

2369
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Nintendo has this kind of shit in the vaults

2370
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And they're capable of putting it on

2371
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
A service like virtual console

2372
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Why aren't they?

2373
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Like yeah we got

2374
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Some of these what Japanese

2375
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Games that never came out here in America

2376
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Or Europe or whatever the case may be

2377
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And like Sin and Punishment right

2378
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
That was a big thing they did a couple years ago or last year

2379
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
How about some of these

2380
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Unreleased Nintendo games that never saw

2381
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
The light of day

2382
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Or here's something kind of interesting

2383
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Seeing as you know

2384
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
They have the 25th anniversary edition

2385
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And the Super Mario All-Stars

2386
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Limited edition stuff coming out

2387
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Which by the way

2388
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Is just a port of the Super Nintendo game

2389
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Why couldn't they have ported over

2390
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I don't know the Super Nintendo

2391
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Cartridge that had both Super Mario World

2392
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
And Super Mario All-Stars

2393
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
You know a little bit extra to go in there

2394
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Seeing as you have a whole fucking disc

2395
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
That you could pack full of stuff

2396
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Why would they do that

2397
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
When they could just put in an ad

2398
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
To go onto the virtual console marketplace

2399
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And spend 800 Wii Points

2400
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
On that game

2401
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Why would they give you something for free Loki

2402
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
You just want something for nothing

2403
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
You want grateful kids

2404
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
What they had for the game

2405
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
They had the pre-order discs

2406
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Remember that you could get the two

2407
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Nintendo 64 Zelda games

2408
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And the two 8-Bit Zelda games

2409
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I don't understand why they can't

2410
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Oh I know because like you said

2411
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
They're selling them on the virtual console

2412
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
That's right

2413
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Rama in our chat room says it could be an unlock lol

2414
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I doubt it

2415
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
By the way there is this

2416
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
25th anniversary Super Mario

2417
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Brothers thing that they did

2418
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
All they did they like changed the copyright

2419
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Date and they just kind of

2420
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Edited the question mark blocks to say

2421
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
25

2422
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Basically it's a ROM hack

2423
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It's on that same level as

2424
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Super Penis Brothers

2425
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Where somebody took all the pictures of Mario

2426
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And turned them into penises

2427
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Which is freely available on the internet

2428
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So that's the business Nintendo is in now

2429
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Speaking of ROM hacks

2430
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I don't think we talked about it last week

2431
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
New Super Mario Brothers

2432
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Someone ROM hacked the

2433
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
DS ROM and made it

2434
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
New Super Mario Brothers

2435
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I remember that coming up last week

2436
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
That's sweet

2437
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
See that's what you do

2438
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Because Mario All Stars

2439
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
That's great that you made everything 16 bit

2440
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
And stuff why don't you just

2441
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Update it again

2442
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Make it all like New Super Mario Brothers

2443
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
So you have all the original levels

2444
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
With Mario Brothers, the lost levels

2445
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Mario 2 and stuff like that

2446
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Make it all brand new

2447
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And guess what you could have sold it for

2448
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
$50 instead of $30

2449
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Here's the thing

2450
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Because basically you're buying a $30 ROM

2451
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Or if they were going to do a ROM hack

2452
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
With this 25th anniversary

2453
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
They could have done a good ROM hack

2454
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
You know some of the ones out there

2455
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
They took the graphics from Mario 3

2456
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
When Mario looked a lot sharper

2457
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
And the sprites were kind of better

2458
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And put it in Mario 1

2459
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
They should have done something like that

2460
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Or maybe they went back and redone the sprites

2461
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I'm not just talking about that

2462
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I'm talking about a ROM hack out there

2463
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
That takes the Mario 3 sprites

2464
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
And puts them in the Mario 1 game

2465
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
This is just a little extra thing

2466
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
For itself

2467
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Oh it's an extra bonus for buying the actual console

2468
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
It's this 25th anniversary edition

2469
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Of Mario Bros

2470
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Which by the way the ROM will probably be floating around out there

2471
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
As if it really needs to be

2472
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Because it's just a simple ROM hack

2473
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
But

2474
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I don't know

2475
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
It's just

2476
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
It's neat I guess

2477
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
But it's not that unique

2478
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Alright well it's a bummer

2479
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
It's probably never going to go anywhere past this

2480
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Wow that's kind of cool

2481
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I'm telling you somebody just grabbed the wrong damn file

2482
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Is probably what happened

2483
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
With this whole prototype getting released

2484
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Somebody grabbed the wrong damn file

2485
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
And didn't even know what they were doing

2486
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Alright anyhow let's get into

2487
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Speaking of classic stuff

2488
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I know we're talking about Donkey Kong

2489
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
But I think Dark Soccer wants to take a trip down memory lane

2490
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And point out a different game

2491
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
She says hey

2492
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Listen up kids

2493
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Grateful brats that don't know what a pie factory is

2494
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
There's a game out there

2495
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
That you should be checking out and playing

2496
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And showing a little love this week

2497
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Although I gotta say I think a lot of the kids

2498
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Know about this one but if they forgot

2499
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
It's time they remember

2500
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I think that we should actually start this one off with the music

2501
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I think we should too so let me pull up the music

2502
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
If they don't get it then

2503
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Yes the game of the week is

2504
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Bubble Bobble

2505
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Which I could have sworn I've done before

2506
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
But I don't think I did so here it is

2507
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Bubble Bobble was put out by Taito

2508
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It came out in 1986

2509
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And came out on Damn Near Everything

2510
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
There are bubble dragons named Bub and Bob

2511
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Or as they were in Japan

2512
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
There was Babarune

2513
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
And Babarune

2514
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And Babarune

2515
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And Babarune

2516
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And Babarune

2517
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And Babarune

2518
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And Babarune

2519
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
So same diff

2520
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
And basically they spit out bubbles

2521
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And push them around

2522
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
And smack their enemies

2523
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And there's been many

2524
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Many many games in their series

2525
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
So yeah basically

2526
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
You blow the bubbles

2527
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
You can trap the enemies in the bubbles

2528
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
And you can push them to

2529
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Burst the bubbles

2530
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And make the enemies fall off

2531
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And the enemies

2532
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
The bubbles with the enemies and it can float

2533
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
So you can jump on them all

2534
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Use them to get to hard to reach places

2535
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Or pop many of them at a time

2536
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
But if they're

2537
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
If they're the last one left on the screen

2538
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
They get angry

2539
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
And change color

2540
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And then you have to bop them

2541
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
And they're harder to get

2542
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Some of them have rocks, lasers, fireballs

2543
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
For projectiles

2544
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
But sometimes you have

2545
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Different things like water

2546
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
And lightning

2547
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Little balls that you can smack them around with

2548
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
As far

2549
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
As ports there have been a

2550
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Bajillion like I said

2551
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And that's the technical term for it

2552
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
There's been Commodore 64

2553

On the Ultra K Taito arcade classics

2571
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
There's also one for the BBC

2572
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Micro that

2573
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Never actually got released

2574
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Taito said in

2575
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
1996 that they lost the

2576
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Original source code

2577
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And um

2578
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Probe

2579
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Was actually

2580
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Sent that so that they

2581
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Could reproduce the mechanics

2582
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
And that also meant that later on

2583
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Uh

2584
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
There were re-releases of

2585
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Rainbow Islands for Saturn, PlayStation

2586
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000

Bubble Bobble in classic Bubble Bobble

2591
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And there's a

2592
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Like I said there was one for the TI-83

2593
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Graphing calculator that someone made which I

2594
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Think I had

2595
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
At one time till my graphing calculator

2596
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Died um there was

2597
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Uh Xbox PS2

2598
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
PC for the Taito Legends

2599
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Compilation um

2600
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It was on mobile phones in Europe and Japan

2601
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And then it came out

2602
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
On the Virtual Console

2603
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
There were also broken versions later on

2604
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Like uh ones that wouldn't let you get past

2605
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Level 30

2606
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Yes seriously

2607
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
As far as other games that came

2608
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Out in the series

2609
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Let's move on to those we have

2610
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Rainbow Islands the Bubble

2611
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
The story of Bubble Bobble 2

2612
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
We have Rainbow Islands extra versions

2613
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Parasol Stars which originally came out

2614
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
On the PC Engine and I know where you can get a copy

2615
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
In town and they want 70 bucks for it

2616
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And I'm like no!

2617
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Which by the way if it feels like you've done this game before

2618
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
It's because you did Parasol Stars

2619
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I did do Parasol Stars

2620
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Parasol Stars is a great game

2621
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And there's also Bubble Bobble Part 2

2622
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000

Rainbow Islands Putty's Party

2626
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Which was on the Wonderswan and I think

2627
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
I have it I have to check

2628
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I've got some Wonderswan games I don't remember what I have

2629
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure

2630
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And Bubble Bobble Plus which is a WiiWare game

2631
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And also Bubble Bobble Neo

2632
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Is the same version that came out on

2633
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Xbox Live Arcade

2634
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And that is Bubble Bobble

2635
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Okay yeah there's

2636
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
There are quite a number

2637
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And don't forget about the related

2638
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Ones in the series

2639
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
There was Puzzle Bobble

2640
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Which was over here Bust a Move

2641
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Mhmm

2642
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Which is a really dumb name

2643
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
For the game

2644
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
There was Azumanga Puzzle Daioh

2645
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
After the Azumanga Daioh

2646
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Which is also in the series

2647
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
So

2648
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Puzzle de Pon, Fairyland Story

2649
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
And Check and Pop

2650
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Similar

2651
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Your classic game of the week boys and girls

2652
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Bubble Bobble on like every system ever made

2653
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
But is there

2654
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
A certain system that you prefer above

2655
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
All others

2656
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I would say original arcade

2657
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
But that's

2658
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Yeah well I can tell you what

2659
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
What my favorite in the

2660
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Series was and what system I played it on

2661
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Was Puzzle Bobble 2 on Saturn

2662
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I played a crap ton

2663
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Of Puzzle Bobble 2 on the Saturn

2664
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Seriously

2665
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I would just sit on the floor in front of Danzel TV

2666
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
And just do nothing but play it

2667
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
And there's so many clones of that game now

2668
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I know I have a free one on the iPhone

2669
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000

But it's still insane

2701
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
All the less

2702
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000

2711
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
It was definitely me, Xtaphir and Rice Princess

2712
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
That's all I'm gonna say

2713
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Anyhow let's get back into some more gaming news

2714
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000

Rock of the Dead

2722
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
The game that actually uses the guitar peripheral

2723
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
For something other than playing guitar

2724
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Is now possibly coming to Facebook

2725
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000

01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
On Conspiracies game

2727
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Is kind of a little bit like

2728
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Typing of the Dead

2729
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000

01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And it's a few

2738
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
They say it's a Facebook game

2739
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
So what a couple weeks after that

2740
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So that's kind of neat I guess

2741
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
It'd be something different to play

2742
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
On Facebook

2743
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Rock band

2744
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
This week has some pretty cool stuff

2745
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Coming out

2746
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Including John Lennon's Imagine album

2747
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
So you can buy the whole album

2748
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
For $15

2749
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Or the equivalent in points

2750
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Or each individual song

2751
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Which includes

2752
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Crippled Inside

2753
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Jealous Guy

2754
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
It's So Hard

2755
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I Don't Wanna Be A Soldier's Mama

2756
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Gimme Some Truth

2757
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Oh My Love

2758
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
How Do You Sleep

2759
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
How

2760
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Oh Yoko

2761
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
And of course the Pro Guitar

2762
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
And Bass Expansions

2763
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Are available for

2764
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Looks like actually only one of the songs

2765
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
In that pack How Do You Sleep

2766
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
That has Pro Guitar and Bass

2767
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And then

2768
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Lastly

2769
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Looks like

2770
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Ark the Lad

2771
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And Ark Arena are coming

2772
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
To the Playstation Network

2773
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Next week

2774
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
So you can get your 8-Bit

2775
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Gaming on there

2776
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Looks like Ark the Lad 2

2777
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Will be available for $5.99

2778
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Well Ark Arena

2779
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I guess it was an offshoot of the series

2780
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Will be

2781
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Can be purchased with Ark the Lad 2

2782
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
For $8.99

2783
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I don't know if the other

2784
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Ark Arena is gonna be available separately

2785
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
But

2786
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
That'll be coming Tuesday November 23rd

2787
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
That's very soon to see now

2788
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Yes a couple days away

2789
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Some of the quick stories here

2790
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
This one is about

2791
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Hold on I have to have an excuse to play this song

2792
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I've been doing this show for what almost 9 years now

2793
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And I don't know if I've ever had an excuse to play this song

2794
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Let's see here

2795
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Gotta pull it up real quick

2796
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
And here we go

2797
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
We played this once in Marching Band

2798
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
That's right it's a Monty Python story

2799
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Yes we've managed to find a

2800
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Story about video games and Monty Python

2801
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Of course it might not be the

2802
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Type of video games you're really into

2803
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
But it's a UK company called

2804
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Zatika

2805
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Which is trying to make a social

2806
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Game based out of the Monty

2807
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Python license

2808
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
They also have games called

2809
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Buttscan

2810
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Yes that's right Buttscan

2811
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
And Mr. Bean out of control

2812
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
That's already being made for

2813
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
The iOS stuff

2814
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
So I don't know whatever

2815
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Here's a quote from the press release

2816
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Monty Python is one of the most iconic

2817
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Comedy licenses around but there has been no new

2818
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Material for over 20 years

2819
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
By acquiring these rights we will be transporting

2820
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Monty Python into the 21st century

2821
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
With a totally new experience for their unique

2822
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Comedy that will delight old and new

2823
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Fans alike. Forget Web 2.0

2824
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
This is Python 2.1 and 3.25

2825
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Well you know what

2826
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
They did something a while back called

2827
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time

2828
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
I do remember that

2829
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
And it had the desktop pythonizer that

2830
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Turned every other sound on your keyboard into farts

2831
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And a game called

2832
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Spam

2833
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Which filled your screen with a giant can of spam

2834
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
And says try to locate the kind of spam

2835
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I love Monty Python

2836
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But this game will probably

2837
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Be about the parrot sketch or something

2838
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
That's been just beaten into the ground

2839
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Speaking of things beaten into the ground

2840
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Are you suggesting that the parrot is dead?

2841
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
This is an

2842
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Expedite

2843
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Anyhow

2844
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
This might be an ex MMO pretty soon

2845
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Final Fantasy 14

2846
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Has extended their free trial

2847
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
For yet another 30 days

2848
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
This is the second time

2849
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
They've done this and they have

2850
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Promised that there's a big update coming

2851
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
On November 25th

2852
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
So this 30 days is a

2853
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Thank you to the existing fan base

2854
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
For sticking with it through all this crap

2855
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
It'd be hilarious

2856
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Isn't November 25th like Thanksgiving?

2857
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Wouldn't it be hilarious if the

2858
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Update wasn't actually an update

2859
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
The fix on the 22nd, Monday, 23rd, Tuesday

2860
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
The 25th is Thanksgiving, they're putting in a patch

2861
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
And I mean I realize it's probably

2862
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
In Japan and they don't really have the same holidays

2863
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
We do but it's still just kind of funny to me

2864
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
But wouldn't it be funny though if the new update wasn't

2865
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Exactly one to fix all the bugs

2866
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It was just like the holiday event

2867
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Right, right. It's a big update

2868
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
There's now snowmen

2869
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Yes, but no auction house

2870
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
No auction house

2871
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Snowmen and fireworks

2872
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Santa costume

2873
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
There's a whole thread

2874
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Actually now I'm curious, I gotta look at what is

2875
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Coming in the November update

2876
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
There's also another update coming in December

2877
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Wow

2878
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
The update's actually just a download

2879
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
For Final Fantasy XI

2880
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
That's right, they are making changes to

2881
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Events and battles

2882
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
UI, they're changing

2883
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
The macro functions, some new map features

2884
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
You can now expand and

2885
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Collapse your map

2886
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
That sounds useful

2887
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Also the map

2888
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
The mouse will now scroll your map

2889
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
That also sounds very useful

2890
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
The left mouse button

2891
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Has been enabled for use

2892
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Good job Square

2893
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
For making my mouse

2894
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Look, I realize the game was developed for a system

2895
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
That has no mouse, but come on

2896
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
The ability to turn left has been added to our

2897
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Make sure

2898
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
No longer will you have to

2899
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Sprint, but the walking

2900
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Functionality will be enabled

2901
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I know there's a

2902
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Hardcore Final Fantasy XIV fan out there

2903
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Listening to this show going, you guys are assholes

2904
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
You guys are just assholes, you don't understand

2905
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Out of the ability

2906
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
To use your right leg

2907
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Rob, that little voice that you did

2908
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Just sounded like Dane Cook's

2909
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Impersonation of himself in the womb

2910
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Don't you ever compare me to

2911
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Dane Cook ever again

2912
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I can't help that is what you sounded like

2913
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Don't you ever

2914
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Moving on

2915
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Ziba in our chatroom says

2916
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I still don't think they have chocobos yet

2917
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Isn't it mandatory in Final Fantasy games

2918
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Like you have to have a chocobo somewhere

2919
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Even the fucking Facebook games have chocobos

2920
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
No, no, no, they're not chocobos anymore

2921
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Now they're just giant turkeys

2922
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Remember, because it's all the same, but different

2923
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Just like, you know

2924
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
That's right, they're now called

2925
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Chocobocos

2926
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Chocobocos

2927
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Chocobocos

2928
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Yeah

2929
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
They're very, very buff

2930
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
They're muscle bound and wearing spandex

2931
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Loki should design an MMO

2932
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
He really should

2933
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
My MMO would be awesome

2934
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
What would your MMO be all about?

2935
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I don't know, it'd be very freeform

2936
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Now we don't want to necessarily rip off

2937
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Freeform like that

2938
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
It's like second

2939
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Organized chaos, if you will

2940
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I don't know

2941
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I'd start off with a traditional MMO

2942
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
And then I would take suggestions

2943
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I would take most of those suggestions

2944
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Alright, anyhow

2945
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I had my own

2946
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Random things

2947
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Now who's interrupting who?

2948
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
You asked, I wasn't done talking

2949
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
So technically you are interrupting me

2950
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Let me finish

2951
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Let me finish

2952
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I'm finished

2953
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Are you really finished?

2954
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
God damn you

2955
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Amaze Satsuma says

2956
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I want a turducken made out of turkey bows

2957
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
There you go

2958
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Chocobos have now been replaced with turduckens

2959
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
And no, my MMO would not be like

2960
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Bonetown, Bonetown is lame

2961
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
My MMO is not lame

2962
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Salacious pop

2963
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Salacious pop

2964
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Salacious pop

2965
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
In our chat

2966
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I'm assuming this is about the Loki MMO

2967
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I'm a dual spec

2968
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Bacon baron and titty hound

2969
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Oh, so you're Loki's wife

2970
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Alright

2971
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Anyhow, moving on

2972
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Hey

2973
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
More Blizzard news that isn't WoW

2974
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
This is about Diablo

2975
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
And apparently

2976
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
There might be, there could possibly

2977
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Be the possibility

2978
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
That Diablo might

2979
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Maybe happen on consoles

2980
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Here's

2981
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Here's the company's official response

2982
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:37,000
To speculation

2983
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Funny, I know someone that

2984
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Would be very

2985
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Appropriate for that

2986
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
It's a studio called Bizarre Creations

2987
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Unfortunately you just

2988
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Fired them, so

2989
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Yeah, it's a little awkward

2990
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Yeah, I'm sure

2991
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
That Diablo would be perfect for consoles

2992
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Because it would make them lots of money

2993
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I mean, seriously, if they thought Bloodstone

2994
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Was a good idea

2995
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Then Diablo is gonna be a great idea

2996
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Now, please

2997
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Note that Blizzard made it very clear

2998
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
On the job posting itself

2999
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Quote, please note this is

3000
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Not an announcement of a console title

3001
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
We are first and foremost developing

3002
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Diablo 3 for Windows and Macs

3003
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
PCs, and don't intend to allow

3004
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Any possibility of a console interpretation

3005
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
To delay or affect the release of that game

3006
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Yes, we first and foremost are developing

3007
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
That, and then we're gonna develop

3008
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
The console version, which we just announced

3009
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Right now, Diablo Ghost coming

3010
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Soon everybody, Diablo Ghost

3011
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Soon on a console near you

3012
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Check it out

3013
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Or don't

3014
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
DarkSakura, what do you got for us before we get to Twitter topics?

3015
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Stuff and nonsense

3016
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
How about an arcade game called

3017
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Let's Connect

3018
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
It, um, basically

3019
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
It was at the

3020
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
IAPPA

3021
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Man, that's gonna be kind of a tone twister

3022
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Trade show, and it uses

3023
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
The Kinect to

3024
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Play things that are like

3025
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I guess the Nintendo's Play Choice 10

3026
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Cabinets, you know, you can pick your game

3027
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And, um

3028
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
So, it's not actually official

3029
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Microsoft thing, but

3030
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
The manufacturer Quasimodo Interactive

3031
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Um

3032
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Needed the license to play

3033
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
The games publicly, so

3034
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I don't know how well that's

3035
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Gonna work, but it's a neat idea

3036
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And then, uh, Kingdom Hearts

3037
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
3D will have

3038
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
New Disney World

3039
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Ooh

3040
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
They are, uh

3041
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
It's gonna have, uh

3042
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
It's gonna be, of course, on the 3DS

3043
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
And it will have Sora and Riku

3044
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
And, um

3045
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
They're just gonna be different places

3046
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I would say that they have to

3047
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Pan out

3048
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But this is, but they're gonna

3049
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
You know, still have the Traverse Town

3050
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
And all the other places still be there

3051
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
But, new places

3052
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
They could do a zone on Princess and the Frog

3053
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
And some of the new things that have come out, but

3054
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
At Cauldron level

3055
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
How about, uh, since there is a new Tron movie

3056
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I'm just saying, the Tron universe can be revisited

3057
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I know!

3058
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
The Space Paranoids level needs to be updated

3059
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Seriously, Disney, if you want a really

3060
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Good primetime animated series

3061
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Boom! There it is

3062
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I'm surprised that hasn't happened, actually

3063
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
It would be awesome

3064
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
There's manga already

3065
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Yeah, that's pretty cool, but

3066
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I mean, seriously

3067
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
You get their animation team behind it

3068
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
And you could do something really

3069
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Awesome

3070
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Awesome while we were cleaning, Axel

3071
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Hot

3072
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Because, I mean, seriously, it's a great series

3073
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
To get people at sea may not be

3074
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I have another story

3075
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Interested in the characters

3076
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Back, you know, into those characters

3077
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
And in other news

3078
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Star Trek Online

3079
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Season 3! Yay!

3080
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Didn't season 2 just come out?

3081
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
A couple months ago

3082
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
But they've just finished up

3083
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Some of the new episodes

3084
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I actually just finished the Davidian

3085
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Missions, and it actually takes some kind of

3086
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Lame psychic energy

3087
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Stealing creatures from the next generation

3088
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And makes them actually pretty cool and

3089
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Badass in a very Silent Hill

3090
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Level sort of thing, it was really cool

3091
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Well, I guess that's kind of cool that they're supporting it

3092
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
As well as they are

3093
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
They put out the scary ones for around Halloween, it was really neat

3094
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Season 4 is going to be entirely in the holodeck

3095
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And it's going to be set in the Wild West

3096
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
The server's called the holodeck

3097
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Our server's called the holodeck

3098
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Our test server's called Tribble

3099
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
At any rate

3100
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Can I play on the Zachary Quinto server?

3101
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Actually, he does voices for a character

3102
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Right at the beginning of the game

3103
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
The emergency medical hologram

3104
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
I'll be playing that level with the lights off

3105
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Anyway

3106
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
What is your emergency?

3107
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
As I was saying

3108
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
The third season

3109
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Starts on December 9th

3110
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
And has a mission

3111
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Creation beta

3112
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
So it's for the

3113
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Foundry is what it's called

3114
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
There's also going to be unlockable Borg tech

3115
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Mission replay

3116
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Which is what I'm looking for

3117
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Shut up Rob

3118
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I'm laughing at what you said, not what you said

3119
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
But I'm looking forward to the mission replay

3120
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Because there were some pretty fun missions

3121
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
There's also going to be one thing that's not in this little piece

3122
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
That I was reading up on

3123
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
The Star Trek Online forums

3124
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
They're going to have extra accolades

3125
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And different prizes you can get for

3126
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Your ship builder missions

3127
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
And making changes to some of them

3128
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Based on your rank and that type of thing

3129
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
So it's looking pretty good

3130
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
They've also got

3131
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Some sort of online ship builder thing too

3132
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
And don't forget about translating your tweets into Klingon

3133
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I'm sorry I'm not programmed to do that

3134
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Oh, you know what they just released

3135
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Which I thought was absolutely retarded

3136
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I mean, not even just retarded

3137
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
But retarded

3138
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
They released the Enterprise

3139
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Outfit packs

3140
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Vulcan chick

3141
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I'm like, dude, that series sucked

3142
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I did get the 7 of 9 outfit though

3143
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I will put pictures up

3144
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
On our website soon

3145
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
You can have 7 of 9

3146
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
But I can't have Zulu

3147
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
You can just have her outfit

3148
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Where everybody gets goatees

3149
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
The evil pack

3150
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
The evil pack

3151
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Tyra Crew gets goatees

3152
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I like that

3153
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Did anyone ever have a goatee in Star Trek except for him?

3154
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I don't remember

3155
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Everyone in Star Trek was fairly clean shaven

3156
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Except for Riker

3157
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
The old school Klingons

3158
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
They all had those weird sort of

3159
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Goatees

3160
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
And now most of the Klingons have uberbeards

3161
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Alright, anyhow

3162
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Let's not turn this into a Star Trek show

3163
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
As much as Star Trek would like that

3164
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Let's go to the Twitter

3165
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Every week you guys send us your tweets

3166
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet

3167
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

3168
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
13forever

3169
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
13crossforever

3170
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
13xforever

3171
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Sends us some tweets

3172
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Wants to alert us to the whole Age of Empires 3 for 10 cents

3173
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
As a lot of people have been doing today

3174
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Just gamers wanting to spread the word about next to free ship

3175
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
But he also wanted to point out

3176
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Game for Windows Marketplace also has

3177
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Bioshock 2 for $9.99

3178
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
And some cheap add-ons for it

3179
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
So I guess the 10 cent deal

3180
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Is not the only deal out there

3181
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I think Bioshock 1 was available for $1.99

3182
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
For a day somewhere

3183
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Probably on Steam

3184
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
See, this is the one reason I support

3185
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
This whole Game for Windows thing

3186
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Because competition, we're all gonna win

3187
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
With these companies

3188
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Trying to undercut each other

3189
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
It's gonna be awesome

3190
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Zebo wanted to alert us to the Final Fantasy 14

3191
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Free trial will be extended again

3192
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
But I already covered that

3193
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Thanks for trying

3194
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Let's see, Retertainment for whatever reason

3195
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Just sent us a tweet that is a picture of Pito Bear

3196
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
In the TSA logo

3197
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Saying the U.S. Department of Molestation

3198
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I don't know if I find that funny

3199
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Just kidding, it's funny

3200
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Pito Bear is always funny

3201
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
My favorite though, nothing will ever top

3202
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
The Pito Bear on the Trader Joe's price tag

3203
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
It was like for honey

3204
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Or something

3205
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I'm sorry, it was funny

3206
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Let's see, TigerClaw sends us a couple of stories

3207
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
On the tweeters

3208
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
One of this is about a really cool hack

3209
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I'm surprised he didn't say anything about this yet

3210
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
But apparently it's using the Open Connect drivers

3211
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that

3212
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Apparently used the Open Connect drivers

3213
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
And image processing

3214
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
To create a lightsaber effect

3215
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
On his PC

3216
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Out of a wooden stick

3217
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
And so the Kinect tracks the wooden stick

3218
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
And replaces it with a lightsaber

3219
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
That is awesome, sir

3220
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
You win the internet

3221
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
And yet, how long is it gonna take for the real lightsaber game

3222
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
To come out, especially with all these layoffs

3223
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Later next year

3224
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
By the way, there's a YouTube out there

3225
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
So of course I'm gonna turn it on and watch this guy

3226
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Oh, this is way better than Star Wars, kid

3227
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Just saying

3228
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
It's actually kinda awesome

3229
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
It's kind of

3230
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
The delay on that is not as terrible as you'd think

3231
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I mean, it's not totally fluid

3232
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
But it's not horrible

3233
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Kinda neat, I like that

3234
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
They're just early drivers, they'll get better

3235
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Again, our Twitter

3236
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

3237
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
O-L-R

3238
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Another tweet from Tiger Claw

3239
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Sending us this one about Pac-Man

3240
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
It's another Pac-Man story, but it's not about Pac-Man Championship Edition DX

3241
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
It is about the Rose Parade

3242
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Yeah, Namco Bandai

3243
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Has said that a 55 foot tall display

3244
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Featuring Pac-Man and

3245
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde

3246
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Is going to be one of the first

3247
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
I'm sorry, the first video game focused

3248
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Float in the 122 year old

3249
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Tournament of Roses parade

3250
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
It's because of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary

3251
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
There's going to be a cake toting

3252
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Pac-Man surrounded by presents

3253
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
And standing atop a bright and colorful

3254
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Cornucopia of floral arrangements

3255
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
You have to remember, it's the Rose Parade

3256
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
There's tons of floral arrangements on every float

3257
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
So, that's kinda cool

3258
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And if you want to see that on TV

3259
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
8 AM Pacific time on Saturday

3260
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
New Year's Day

3261
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
That's right, you have to get up at 8 AM

3262
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Or set your TiVo

3263
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Or just wait for the YouTube that will inevitably show up on all the gaming blogs

3264
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
There you go

3265
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Anyway, Sonic the Hedgehog was the first

3266
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Video game character that ever had a balloon

3267
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
But that was in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade

3268
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
That's a whole other parade

3269
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Pikachu was also in that parade

3270
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
But in 2001

3271
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
And then escaped and killed everybody

3272
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Yes, it did

3273
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
But no one wants to report on that

3274
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Let's see, Spazenator

3275
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
PSN wants us to note

3276
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
That there is a release that didn't get mentioned earlier

3277
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
The Magic the Gathering game

3278
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
That is on Xbox Live Arcade is being ported

3279
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
To PSN this Tuesday

3280
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
And he sends a follow-up tweet

3281
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Saying, I recommend the Magic the Gathering

3282
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
PSN game for those who don't already have it

3283
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
On Xbox Live Arcade or like

3284
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
The Magic the Gathering card game

3285
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Yeah, it was a pretty faithful translation

3286
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
It's kinda hard to translate an intricate

3287
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Card game like that when cards can be played

3288
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
At a variety of times

3289
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
To a console, but they did a pretty decent job

3290
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Even though I think

3291
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
It plays a little faster in real life

3292
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
But still kinda neat

3293
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
And certainly a lot cheaper

3294
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Oh my god, trying to collect those cards?

3295
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Geez

3296
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
So I think that's gonna close it for the Twitter

3297
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I'm doing one last refresh to make sure we don't get any last minute tweets

3298
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Nope, I don't see any

3299
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
So I hope that's not a bug or whatever

3300
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
But yeah, Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets in the future

3301
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
In the meantime

3302
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Some more news stories for you guys

3303
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Then we're gonna be getting to the Skype line in a little bit

3304
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
At 1-877-GAME-OLR

3305
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
But first, Loki

3306
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Ah, yes

3307
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Um, I don't know what to think of this

3308
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
I honestly didn't play the first game

3309
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
But this doesn't sound

3310
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Very close to the original image

3311
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Of Yars' Revenge

3312
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Uh, Yars' Revenge is being made

3313
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Or remade into an anime-inspired rail shooter

3314
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Um

3315
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Honestly

3316
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
It

3317
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
It seems like

3318
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
A stretch to me

3319
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I was making the joke earlier saying that

3320
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
It really should have been about an angry pirate

3321
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
But, um

3322
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
YARRRR

3323
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
YARRR I will have my revenge

3324
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
But, uh, yeah

3325
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
It's supposed to be like some sort of

3326
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
You know, they're saying like

3327
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Like a Xeno saga

3328
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Or something like that

3329
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I don't know

3330
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
It seems like a stretch to me

3331
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Um, it's kinda weird

3332
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Because Yars' Revenge was like

3333
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Probably one of the greatest Atari 2600 games

3334
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
There ever was

3335
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
That wasn't by Activision

3336
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Um, I've never played it

3337
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
It's cool, but you know

3338
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
You play it now

3339
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
And you go like, there's not a lot to this

3340
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
What is this? But you have to remember

3341
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Atari 2600 games were very straightforward

3342
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Back in the day, I mean

3343
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Games were four kilobytes

3344
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
In size back then

3345
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
You write essays now that are longer than that

3346
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
You know what I mean? Like, they had to cram a lot

3347
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
In those little cartridges, so most of the games were

3348
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Very straightforward

3349
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
So fine, they're reinventing it or whatever

3350
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
But this whole like, anime chick

3351
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
And rail shooter, like, doesn't seem to be

3352
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
At all similar

3353
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
To what was there before

3354
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
As long as there's like, some

3355
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Resemblance to the original game

3356
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I would approve

3357
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
But I have a bad feeling I'm not gonna be seeing that

3358
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Yeah

3359
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I mean, I guess a good game's a good game

3360
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
No matter what they do artistically

3361
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
With it, but I just

3362
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I think y'all can see where we're all a little

3363
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Apprehensive

3364
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
But we'll see, we have yet to really

3365
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
See gameplay, the only trailer that's come

3366
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Out so far is this weird announcement video

3367
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Right? Yes. So

3368
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
We'll see when gameplay comes out

3369
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
That's true, Dungeon Busters

3370
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
In our chatroom saying, there was more

3371
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Story in the manual than there was in the

3372
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Actual Yars Revenge game, very true

3373
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Very true point

3374
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Alright, moving on to another story

3375
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Talk about more old

3376
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Games making a comeback, but this time not quite

3377
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
As old, it's the Dreamcast collection

3378
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Yay

3379
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
The Dreamcast collection has been listed for the

3380
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Xbox 360 and the PS3

3381
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
This was caught in a listing on GameStop

3382
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
It's the Dreamcast collection

3383
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Supposed to cost $29.99

3384
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And the date that is tentative

3385
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Right now anyway for release is February 15th

3386
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
You shouldn't really treat these

3387
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
GameStop leaks as, you know

3388
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Word and Bond and all that because

3389
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
It could change, and a lot of these are

3390
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Service holders to get people to pre-order them

3391
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
But you what?

3392
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I haven't seen anything yet

3393
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Okay, here's the weird thing though

3394
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Is that Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi

3395
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Are the only announced

3396
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Dreamcast games right now

3397
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Now those games are going to cost $10

3398
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Well obviously Sonic Adventure already came out

3399
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Crazy Taxi I believe is this week

3400
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
They cost only $10 a piece to download

3401
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
So it would make no sense why you would drop

3402
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
$30 on this game when these two games

3403
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Are $20

3404
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Some more XBLA and PSN ports

3405
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
That have not yet been announced

3406
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Are coming

3407
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
By the way there were a couple that had leaked

3408
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Previously including Sega Bass Fishing

3409
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
And Space Channel 5

3410
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Part 2

3411
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
So that could be

3412
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Where this is going is that maybe it will be

3413
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Four games in one

3414
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Although I could really do without Sega Bass Fishing

3415
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I'm sorry but I'm not really into the

3416
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Fishing games but whatever

3417
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
But

3418
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Okay it was fun with the rod controller

3419
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
And

3420
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
But mostly because of the fact like haha

3421
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
It's a rod controller now I'm over it

3422
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
And then in the Japanese version it would say

3423
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
FISH GET

3424
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
We need the game that was formally named

3425
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Daytona

3426
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Do do do do do do

3427
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Have you seen the new one now?

3428
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
They don't have the Daytona song in there

3429
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
So it's like do do do do do do

3430
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Let's go

3431
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Let's go

3432
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Cheat pack

3433
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
It's pretty fun

3434
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Thank you. So ladies and gentlemen in our chat room

3435
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Needs to have Power Stone 1 and 2

3436
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Thanks. Agreed with those Capcom games

3437
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Ah yes they were

3438
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
So probably not gonna happen

3439
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
But you can dream

3440
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Remember Power Stone collection did come out on

3441
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
PSP. Oh that's right. Good call

3442
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Anyhow Dark Sakura

3443
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
What do you have for us?

3444
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I have stuff and nonsense again

3445
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Actually this is pretty cool

3446
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Pinball is coming to Xbox Live

3447
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Arcade and Playstation Network

3448
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
In December

3449
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Put out by Zen Studios

3450
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Um

3451
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
It actually was leaked out

3452
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Because of a ratings board

3453
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Deal

3454
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
But it's going to be coming out

3455
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
And it will have

3456
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Different tables that are

3457
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Themed after Marvel

3458
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Superheroes like one that I'm looking at

3459
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Right now is Iron Man Pinball

3460
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
I don't know

3461
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
If it's actually patterned after the stern Iron Man

3462
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Pinball. I don't think so

3463
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Because that table kinda sucked

3464
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
The one based off of the movie

3465
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Not for the comic

3466
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
And then they said initially

3467
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Four different tables will be available

3468
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
There's Blade, Spiderman, Wolverine and as I said

3469
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Iron Man

3470
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Taking a look at some of them right now

3471
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
And there's also supposed to be

3472
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
New download content coming

3473
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Later on

3474
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Okay the Blade one looks stupid

3475
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Iron Man one looks okay

3476
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Spiderman one looks kinda fun

3477
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Um

3478
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
The Wolverine one

3479
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
It's Wolverine

3480
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Oh it's alright

3481
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
I don't know it could be fun

3482
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
I'm kinda picky on my Pinball

3483
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I'll check it out. I think Pinball FX2 is pretty awesome

3484
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Yeah we got it

3485
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Good times

3486
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
It's free. Everybody should go get it if you don't already have it

3487
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I know right

3488
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
It's the same. It automatically imports all the tables

3489
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I think I talked about this last week or the week before

3490
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
You did? I did

3491
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Well it's not a big surprise

3492
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Rumors that the

3493
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
PSP2 prototype

3494
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
They have leaked images

3495
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Of it and

3496
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
It's actually been confirmed by some

3497
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Developers

3498
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Saying that the photos are legitimate

3499
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
But that it's

3500
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
A dev kit and that the hardware

3501
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Will probably change

3502
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
The way it looks by the time the system comes out

3503
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
But some of the features that were

3504
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Noticed in the pictures

3505
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
It's got a front facing camera

3506
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Microphone

3507
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Finally two analog

3508
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Sticks which is awesome

3509
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Also has a back facing camera

3510
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
And the rumored

3511
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Trackpad which is on the back

3512
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Of the device

3513
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
That seems awfully weird to me

3514
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Unless somehow the screen like

3515
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Flips over where you can use the trackpad on the front

3516
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
But um

3517
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Neat

3518
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I guess

3519
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
The prototype right now looks very similar

3520
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
To like the PSP Go

3521
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
But they're saying that it's possible that they may

3522
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Make either

3523
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
They're gonna have like two different models

3524
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
One that resembles like the PSP 3000

3525
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
And one the PSP Go or it's gonna be just

3526
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
The PSP Go

3527
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Also it will not have a UMD drive

3528
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Instead it will be using

3529
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Some sort of memory

3530
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Sticks

3531
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Interesting so they are

3532
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Saying there's gonna be a physical media

3533
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
But it's just not gonna be these discs anymore

3534
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Uh yeah

3535
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Let me be the first to say that if it's gonna be memory

3536
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Sticks that this thing's gonna be using

3537
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
This will be cracked so fast

3538
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
It's not even funny

3539
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Because if it's on a physical device like that

3540
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Why even bother

3541
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I know that's kind of

3542
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
A scary thought on their side

3543
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
But not a lot of other

3544
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Like new things about what could be on this system

3545
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Besides the whole trackpad thing

3546
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I mean you know

3547
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
The new DS is going

3548
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
All 3D

3549
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
And stuff

3550
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Well the top screen looks like it's supposed to be

3551
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
An HD screen they're saying that the

3552
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Graphics are gonna be comparable to the

3553
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Xbox 360

3554
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Oh interesting

3555
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Alright well I'm sure we'll be hearing

3556
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Plenty more about that at E3

3557
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Because it really is hard to say

3558
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
That this is not at least somewhat

3559
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
True at this point

3560
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Anyhow we got about 6 months to go before E3

3561
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Something that's coming out a lot sooner

3562
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
If you want to get a new console is the

3563
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
OnLive micro console

3564
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
It is coming out December 2nd and it costs

3565
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
$99 this is the whole little

3566
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Console for you to use OnLive on your

3567
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
TV and yeah

3568
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
When they say micro console like this thing

3569
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
It's small I mean it's basically a

3570
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Miniature PC that will just do all the

3571
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Connecting to the internet and the whole cloud

3572
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Gaming thing

3573
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Strange little thing

3574
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
They've already got those internet TV devices

3575
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Like at Fry's so I imagine it's the same deal

3576
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
It's you know all it is is really

3577
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
It just serves the

3578
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Sole function of connecting to the online

3579
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Services and using whatever technology it does to

3580
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Deliver the video just quickly

3581
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
To your TV so

3582
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Kinda cool

3583
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
By the way they are saying that you will only be able to get

3584
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
This though on the OnLive

3585
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Website until like next year

3586
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
And it's only going to be in limited quantities

3587
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
So if you think you might want one of these

3588
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
You gotta act like really soon

3589
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
There is some other news coming out of OnLive

3590
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
They are getting rid

3591
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Of the whole monthly fee that is

3592
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Going out the door

3593
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
There's now going to be a flat rate pricing

3594
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Plan that will provide access to

3595
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Back catalog and indie games

3596
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Kinda similar to what you see with Netflix

3597
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
And all that it's

3598
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
So they're thinking maybe no more than $10

3599
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
A month but there's no longer going to be a fee just to

3600
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Access the service itself which is always

3601
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Kinda a dumb idea and nobody was really

3602
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Paying for it yet anyway because it was like

3603
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Sponsored right now but yeah

3604
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
That is all going out the window which is good

3605
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
More information on the full

3606
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Pricing and the lineup will be coming out in December

3607
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
That's according to the CEO Steve

3608
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Prolem in December we'll announce

3609
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Pricing and the lineup of games it's literally

3610
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Just a matter of getting publishers to sign

3611
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
This and that and the other thing so

3612
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Very cool they eliminated the monthly

3613
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Subscription fee after they kinda pulled the

3614
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
User base and looked there

3615
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
And saw what users really wanted

3616
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
That's cool that they're listening to that

3617
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
That's smart

3618
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Also there

3619
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Could be some new platforms that come to this

3620
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
As well and possibly

3621
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Exclusive games

3622
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
The company is trying to get some big name

3623
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Releases as well Duke Nukem Forever

3624
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Deus Ex Human Revolution

3625
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Red Faction Armageddon

3626
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Ghost Recon Future Soldier Fear 3

3627
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Driver and so on and so on and so on

3628
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
All those types of games they're trying to get as well

3629
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
What's also interesting

3630
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Is that they're looking at

3631
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
iOS versions of the client

3632
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Software so on live

3633
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
On your iPhone

3634
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
That won't work very well I don't know how that would work

3635
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Without better controls

3636
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
But I guess

3637
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
You might

3638
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Might not be too far out of the realm

3639
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Of possibility I mean if Netflix and all that

3640
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Is on there somebody wants to put games on there

3641
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
So I don't have to control with you

3642
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I know I get that I get that but who knows

3643
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Who knows what could happen

3644
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
So there you go

3645
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
By the way Apple TV they've also

3646
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Been toying with the idea of in Google TV

3647
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
But they say Apple TV

3648
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
May not work because it runs at 720p

3649
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
And 30 frames a second you'll never get above

3650
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
30 frames a second and you can't really

3651
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Get the 720p

3652
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
So

3653
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Who knows

3654
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Anyhow let's move on and open up the old

3655
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Mailbag every week DarkSakura

3656
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Dives into the mailbag head first

3657
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Mailbag at

3658
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com and she pulls out some

3659
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Of her favorite emails and reads them for us

3660
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Live on air but

3661
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I don't know if there were a lot of pickins this week were there

3662
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
No there weren't but I did get a reply

3663
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
From the one who

3664
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Got the

3665
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Wrong name and because

3666
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
They're so nice about it

3667
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
He's our winner

3668
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Aww what a nice

3669
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Well Mike

3670
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Congratulations you've

3671
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Won a Castlevania Symphony of the

3672
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Night Xbox Live Arcade

3673
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Code

3674
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Enjoy

3675
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Free stuff is always good

3676
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
So that's it

3677
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
That was it for the emails really?

3678
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
We didn't get any questions or nothing?

3679
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
No

3680
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Dear OrangeLoungeRadio why is DarkSakura

3681
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
So cool

3682
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I don't know listener

3683
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
I think it's in her DNA

3684
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
And that says such a bitch

3685
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Like I think you changed

3686
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Rob got pot hollered

3687
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
At least it wasn't

3688
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Flaming hot pot holder

3689
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Well that was mailbag fail

3690
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Fail

3691
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Every one of you needs to send

3692
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
An email and then we'll get Rob to read them

3693
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
DarkSakura is going to have to read 50 emails next week

3694
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
We'll get our special guest to read them next week

3695
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Do we have special guest next week?

3696
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
You know who our special guest is?

3697
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Marissa

3698
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I am so excited

3699
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
We need a pile of

3700
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
emails bigger than her boobies

3701
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
That's a lot of emails

3702
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
That's impossible

3703
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Get starting

3704
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Marissa's rack is quite mighty

3705
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Well in the absence of emails

3706
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:33,000
There's always time for FUs

3707
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Um FU to the sudden realization of my unemployment

3708
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I hated that place

3709
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
A lot of the people I worked with

3710
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Actually a lot of them pissed me off too

3711
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
But

3712
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
It's sort of the uncertainty side of things

3713
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
What am I going to do now?

3714
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I'm not having insurance

3715
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
But I get to finish school

3716
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I can sleep in as much as I want to

3717
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And I'm getting my severance check

3718
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
So it's not a big loss

3719
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
But still kind of melancholy

3720
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
You know what I mean?

3721
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
It's a weird in between

3722
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
place kind of be

3723
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
And also um

3724
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
I want frozen yogurt a lot so I feed me not having any even though I do have pumpkin ice cream

3725
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
OMG I want pink berry so bad

3726
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Pink berry!

3727
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Let's go

3728
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
That pumpkin pink berry right now

3729
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
It's not good

3730
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
It's not terrible though

3731
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
But it's pumpkin

3732
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Hardly

3733
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Whatever

3734
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Loki

3735
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I guess FU to um

3736
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I don't know black asleep I guess

3737
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
It's just uh

3738
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
You don't have to get up early every day

3739
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
It sucks

3740
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I hate waking up at 4 in the morning

3741
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
And sleeping on the couch

3742
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Well

3743
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
It'll only be for hopefully

3744
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
A few more months

3745
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Or maybe another year or two or three

3746
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
A few more years

3747
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Look forward to it

3748
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
A few more years and then um

3749
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
The random calling into bed and getting kicked in the head

3750
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
That happens too

3751
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
And then when he's like 15 or 16 he's gonna start fighting with you every day

3752
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:15,000
And then your friends who don't have children have to hear about it

3753
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Or your entire internet radio audience that'll be fun

3754
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I'm also sending major hearts to Becky right now

3755
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
My FU of the week

3756
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Uh goes to all the sand

3757
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:29,000
That somehow lodged itself in my vagina earlier this week

3758
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Because dang there was a lot of it

3759
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
No I had a really crap week

3760
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
But things got better they always do

3761
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
It gets better guys

3762
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
It gets better

3763
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
That's really it otherwise I'm just

3764
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Just looking forward to getting the week of

3765
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Lady you know

3766
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
You know we're doing a show right

3767
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Yeah

3768
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
But I want Dan to give an FU because Dan's FUs are amazing

3769
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Okay George can do one

3770
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
An FU?

3771
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
FU of the week duh

3772
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Aren't you mad at something that you want to say FU to?

3773
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Jamie loves to put people on the squad

3774
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I know I love doing it George

3775
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Which is kind of shocking because I'm normally mad at everything

3776
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
What's that George? Hi George

3777
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Hello

3778
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I'm normally mad at everything but I'm not mad at anything this week

3779
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Well FU for being so happy

3780
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Damn you and your happiness

3781
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
So I gave you one

3782
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
That's awesome

3783
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Alright

3784
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Poor George

3785
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
That's when people come over to my house they get to be on the show

3786
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
You come over to my house you're going to be telling them my show

3787
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Get in here

3788
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Nobody gets off the stage unless they sing the blues

3789
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
You know where that came from right

3790
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Adventures in babysitting

3791
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Just a couple more stories then we're going to get to the skype line

3792
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
At 1877 game

3793
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
O-L-R

3794
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Hey oh I don't know if I like this

3795
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Jamie get ready to rage

3796
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
What? Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room

3797
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
FU to Jamie for fucking up the FUs of the week

3798
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
You know what

3799
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Don't say that to somebody with ops

3800
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Because I will kick your ass

3801
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Literally

3802
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Alright

3803
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Oh no

3804
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Oh no he didn't

3805
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Alright

3806
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Oh he says FU to myself

3807
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Alright

3808
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I don't care

3809
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Alright lowkey come on let's move on

3810
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Portal 2 has been delayed again

3811
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Yeah man it wasn't going to come out

3812
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
When they said anything

3813
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Wait wait wait wait you mean Valve delayed a game?

3814
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
What?

3815
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
What?

3816
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
And this is news?

3817
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
That's alright though it's just putting extra polish on it

3818
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
It's been delayed to April 20th 2011

3819
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
The day after my birthday

3820
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
People you know what to do

3821
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
It's the day after your birthday

3822
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
You're screwed

3823
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
My birthday lasts all week

3824
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
It was originally planned for holiday 2010

3825
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
And delayed to February 9th

3826
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
2011

3827
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
So now it's April

3828
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
I kind of always thought it was going to be April anyways

3829
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I thought that's what it was

3830
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I didn't realize it was actually February

3831
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
It was the release date for that but yeah whatever

3832
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
It's April now so get over it

3833
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Alright just in time for Jamie's birthday

3834
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
What about my birthday?

3835
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
What are you going to get me for my birthday Valve?

3836
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I'll give you a dollar

3837
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
You're not Valve

3838
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I'll give you a Valve

3839
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I'm sure we got a couple

3840
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Alright file this last story

3841
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Of our night under what

3842
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
And huh

3843
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Yeah this is a

3844
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Comment from Bobby Kotick I don't know why

3845
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Whatever this guy says makes news but I don't know

3846
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
You love to hate him or you hate to love him

3847
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I don't know very interesting comic

3848
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Though a comic

3849
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Freudian slip maybe I don't know

3850
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Very interesting comment from Mr. Kotick

3851
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Though it's about the online pass

3852
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Thing you know EA, THQ

3853
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
$10 online play if you buy

3854
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
The game used

3855
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Quote from Bobby Kotick

3856
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
We can do some of these things

3857
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
EA's and others have done

3858
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
We actually don't think it's in the best interest

3859
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Of the gamer and so we've chosen not to

3860
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
From a financial

3861
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Perspective you look at it and say

3862
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Okay well the retailer is not paying us

3863
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Anything for the privilege of doing it and you know

3864
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
We invest all this capital in making a game

3865
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
We're not getting any credit any return on their

3866
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Resale of the game but you know something

3867
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
The best way to keep people engaged in your game

3868
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Experience is to keep giving them

3869
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
More great content

3870
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I think you always need to be sensitive to that

3871
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Relationship and not crossing the line to a

3872
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Place where the customer feels like they

3873
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Have been taken advantage of

3874
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
So that's why

3875
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
They would rather put out $15

3876
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Map packs for their games

3877
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Than an online pass

3878
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
You know what though

3879
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
I'm actually kind of okay

3880
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
With that

3881
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I mean

3882
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
It would be better if it was cheaper but at least

3883
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
It's like more content

3884
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
But the only thing, here's what I don't like

3885
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Is that when that additional content

3886
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Is um

3887
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Stuff that like is

3888
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Necessary to the game and what I

3889
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Really hate is when that content is already

3890
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
On the disc because that is not

3891
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Downloadable content, oh man I haven't gone on

3892
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Download to unlock, I haven't gone on this rant

3893
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
In years, that is not downloadable

3894
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Content that is pay to unlock

3895
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Content and that's what we should be referring

3896
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
To it as, when you're

3897
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Paying to unlock content on our young disc

3898
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Like beautiful

3899
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Katamari on the 360, had plenty of pay

3900
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
To unlock content

3901
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
There it is

3902
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Alright that's gonna do it for our

3903
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
News stories tonight

3904
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
We're gonna open up the Skype line now, I should probably take us

3905
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Off Do Not Disturb in order to do that

3906
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype

3907
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Or you can give us a call on the old telefono

3908
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
877-GAME-OLR

3909
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Is our name on

3910
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
I'm sorry 877-GAME-OLR

3911
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Is our phone number

3912
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
And you can give that a call

3913
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
In the meantime

3914
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
I don't know if Loki has any

3915
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Last minute stories tonight but

3916
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
You have anything last minute for us Loki?

3917
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Uh

3918
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Yeah apparently there's gonna be

3919
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
A new cheat tool coming to the

3920
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
PlayStation 3 from Code Freak

3921
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Um

3922
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Apparently the people

3923
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Behind the Code Freak

3924
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Um tool

3925
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
CyberGadget have announced a new device coming

3926
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
To the PS3 in Japan

3927
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Um it's a

3928
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Walkthrough tool as they call it

3929
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
And it's gonna cost 7800 yen

3930
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
And it'll come with cheats for 50 titles

3931
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
And they say

3932
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
More codes can be downloaded via

3933
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
PC

3934
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
So I don't know

3935
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
It sounds like modified saves almost

3936
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Shall we go to the phones?

3937
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Yes let's

3938
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

3939
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Hey this is X-Link

3940
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Hi X-Link

3941
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I just had to beat out Rama for one week

3942
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
That's alright long time listener first time caller right?

3943
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
As always

3944
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
What's on your mind?

3945
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I have a question for you

3946
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
How the hell can you dog Age of Empire 3

3947
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
But yet you will play Civilization

3948
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Because I'm a hypocrite

3949
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I'm just kind of curious

3950
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I was like wait a minute you're sitting there saying

3951
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Age of Empire is not worth the 10 cents

3952
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
But yet you would play

3953
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Powers on end Civilization 5

3954
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Because I have a very simple answer for you

3955
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
It's just gonna blow your mind

3956
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
My simple answer for all of this X-Link

3957
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
It's amazing I can't solve world peace

3958
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
You ready?

3959
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
The reason why I don't want to pay 10 cents

3960
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
For Age of Empires 3 is because

3961
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I have Civilization 5

3962
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I don't need anything else

3963
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Well that's true I kind of agree with you

3964
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Unfortunately I don't have Civilization 5

3965
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
So I have to go with the next best thing for right now

3966
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
But yes

3967
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
In all seriousness

3968
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
You know what 10 cents for a game is obviously a steal

3969
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
But I'm just more making fun of the fact that like

3970
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
The entirety of the internet is freaking out about like

3971
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
OMG game for 10 cents

3972
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
But it's kind of like well yeah

3973
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
The game's 5 years old and who would give a shit about this anyway

3974
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
It's like most of the Steam sales

3975
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
You rarely see current games

3976
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Going on sale on Steam

3977
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Although to be fair

3978
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Steam does manage to get some of those really good deals

3979
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Like you know when they were putting Torchlight on sale

3980
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
For like half its price

3981
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
They've done some deals with Poker Night which isn't even out yet

3982
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
So you know

3983
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Which I'm looking forward to that

3984
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Because that supposedly is going to be coming out Tuesday

3985
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
So I'm definitely looking forward to that

3986
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
I think it's actually tomorrow

3987
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Is it tomorrow? I think so

3988
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Maybe it's tomorrow

3989
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Jeremy Todd one in our chatroom says

3990
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
But it's only 10 cents

3991
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I bought it 6 different times just so I can have more AOE 3 than you

3992
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Now that's showing your support

3993
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Wow

3994
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Yeah but yeah

3995
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
You know again

3996
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Competition never a bad thing

3997
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
I'm really excited for Black Friday

3998
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
OMG we're going to get some steal games

3999
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
But that's a really good deal though

4000
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
10 cents you can't really

4001
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Don't really want to pass that up

4002
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
For even a game I mean even if you don't get a gift

4003
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
For somebody else you know 10 cents

4004
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
We'll see we'll see

4005
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:07,000
It sounds like almost like we're doing one of those info commercials for those children

4006
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I know right

4007
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
It's just the price of a cup of coffee a day

4008
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Precisely

4009
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
But you know I saw that I was amazed by that

4010
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I'm like a $40 game 10 cents

4011
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Well it was $40 back in 2005

4012
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,000
But I guarantee you that game is in like $3 bargain bins

4013
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
At Best Buys everywhere

4014
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Probably but according to their website it was still at $40

4015
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Well of course because it's a Microsoft game

4016
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
They don't want to admit that it's you know

4017
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Yes they officially haven't dropped the price of it

4018
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Does not mean everybody else hasn't to try to clear out inventory

4019
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
That's right

4020
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Speaking of Microsoft and things like that

4021
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I'm actually looking forward to this whole Dungeon Siege 3

4022
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Even though technically it's what Squeenix is doing it now

4023
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Microsoft has done the first couple games

4024
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I'm looking forward to that

4025
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Those should be very interesting

4026
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Hopefully they don't bastardize it like Final Fantasy XIV

4027
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Well it's not like an online MMO type of thing

4028
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
And don't feel too bad

4029
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
I was right with you with the whole raid thing

4030
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Remember because unfortunately my account

4031
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I was stupid and let it lapse

4032
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
So I wasn't there during that whole time

4033
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Yeah we're not able to take phone calls during Horde House

4034
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
So I know you couldn't really chime in on this

4035
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
But yeah I know we both missed it

4036
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
At least you don't have to feel all alone

4037
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Like I'm the only one who didn't get it

4038
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
No I'm right there with you

4039
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
All in due time my friend

4040
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Yeah I know we'll get it eventually

4041
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
We just might be level 81 or 82

4042
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,000
But hey it'll work out

4043
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
We'll be geared for it

4044
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Cataclysm happening soon

4045
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
The rumor on the street is that the world is coming to an end

4046
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
On Tuesday in World of Warcraft

4047
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
It's the end of the world as we know it

4048
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
But I feel fine

4049
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
They're doing a lot of odds and ends and disconnects

4050
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Going to be more Gloriant than ever

4051
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
So yes

4052
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
We all look forward to that

4053
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Now you started playing WoW with Wrath of the Lich King right?

4054
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
So are you looking forward to your first

4055
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Proper expansion rolling out?

4056
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
No because I don't have the money for it

4057
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Aww

4058
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Well you know what the good news is though

4059
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
You won't be competing with everyone else

4060
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Trying to level in those zones and everything

4061
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Because it's going to be a shit show

4062
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I was going to do that anyways to be quite honest

4063
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
My first goal when that was going to come out

4064
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Was going to be the archeology

4065
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
To get that to 450

4066
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Gotcha

4067
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Well anyway the other hosts are going to start

4068
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Glaring at me if I fill up the show with the Warcraft chat

4069
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Nope

4070
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
My eyes glosed over and my brain went foggy

4071
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Exactly

4072
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
That's why they made me take it to a separate show

4073
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Have a good one

4074
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Thanks for calling

4075
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Bye

4076
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000

Meanwhile do we have any last minute stories

4080

Mr. Loki over there

4081
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Well good

4082
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Because we have other calls coming in so we might as well go to those calls

4083
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this

4084
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Hey it's Ronman this time my Skype works

4085
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Long time listener first time caller right

4086
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Hi

4087
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
What's on your mind buddy

4088
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Hey um

4089
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Now this is something I wanted to talk about

4090
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Unfortunately I wasn't able to last week but

4091
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
This is the whole

4092
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Music game genre with

4093
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Rock band and guitar hero

4094
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Now let me ask you

4095
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Guys do you see it

4096
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Like really dying

4097
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Dead like DDR or

4098
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Something else

4099
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
DDR hasn't exactly fallen

4100
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Over dead though like I get what you're saying

4101
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
DDR is not what it was to

4102
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
You and me ten years ago

4103
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
But they did just release a game

4104
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Two weeks ago so I don't see any

4105
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Reason why they won't continue to release

4106
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Rock band style plastic guitar and drum

4107
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Games ten years from now

4108
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
But it's not going to be what it was

4109
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
In it's hey day when rock band and all

4110
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
This stuff first came out

4111
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Okay cause the way I see it is this

4112
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Konami throws us DDR

4113
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Yay here's another one

4114
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Yay here's another one

4115
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Wait wait what is this

4116
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Yeah Konami we got to talk what is

4117
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
This drop

4118
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Or as with rock band and guitar hero

4119
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Here you go yay

4120
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Here you go plus we threw her some

4121
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
More stuff sweet

4122
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Here's another game this time

4123
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
We'll give you more stuff sweet

4124
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
That's the way I see it

4125
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
And having an interesting

4126
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Discussion with a couple of people on Twitter about this

4127
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Who think that the whole

4128
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Gaming rhythm gaming is falling

4129
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Apart due to lack of sales

4130
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
I honestly believe lack of sales

4131
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Come from the fact of it's too

4132
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Damn expensive because of the pricing

4133
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Of the bundles and all the other accessories

4134
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
More or less right about now in this economy

4135
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Who has 180 bucks

4136
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
And what I would tell your friends on

4137
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Twitter is again the sales

4138
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Of Dance Central sort of

4139
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Kind of counters that argument that music games

4140
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Are just dead in the water

4141
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Music games are just evolving

4142
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Plastic guitar and plastic drum games

4143
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Are on their way out

4144
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
That is what these studies are showing

4145
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
What has the music genre been focused on for the past few years

4146
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
What has the media been focused on for the past few years

4147
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
It's all about these plastic guitar games

4148
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Alright their time is coming to an end

4149
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Let's bring on the next big thing in music gaming

4150
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
It's out there somewhere

4151
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Which is why I don't blame

4152
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
EA for not bundling

4153
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Rock band 3

4154
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
With a pro guitar

4155
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Or even a regular guitar

4156
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
My roommate went to go buy the game like last Sunday

4157
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
He comes back and he's like I didn't buy the game

4158
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
It's because all the instruments are not made by EA anymore

4159
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
So that's why they're not doing any of the bundles

4160
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Even the bundles with the keyboard were actually

4161
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Being published by Mad Cats

4162
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
And they opted out on doing

4163
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Bundles with all that stuff because they need to have

4164
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
80,000 bundles in the stores

4165
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
And it would confuse people

4166
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Most retailers though are kind of smart

4167
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
And they put the plastic guitars

4168
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Right next to the game, you know what I mean?

4169
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Exactly, and I explained that to him

4170
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
But he still, it took me like 3 days

4171
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
To explain to him, they're not bundling it

4172
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Because it's a different company making the accessories

4173
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
If you want the pro guitar that badly

4174
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Just be like everybody else

4175
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Pre-order, go down there

4176
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
And whoop somebody's ass to get one

4177
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Interesting, I wonder if

4178
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Just all this saturation is partially to blame

4179
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Well, as we went into a couple weeks ago

4180
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
On the show, it kind of is

4181
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I think Guitar Hero

4182
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
In some ways is to blame for rock bands

4183
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Tumble

4184
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
But I don't know, you know what?

4185
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
We still have All Christmas to get through

4186
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I think they'll still sell more copies of Rock Band 3

4187
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
I tend to think so too

4188
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
And you know

4189
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Not for nothing, I did pick up Rock Band

4190
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
The Beatles' Rock Band, but I can understand why

4191
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
The game didn't do so well

4192
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
And the same thing with Green Day Rock Band

4193
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Because it's simple

4194
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Most of today's, to this generation

4195
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Probably had never heard of the Beatles

4196
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I guarantee you

4197
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
I guess it's just me being biased

4198
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
But if it was Rock Band, Bon Jovi

4199
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
I think we would have done at least 2-3 times

4200
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Normal sales

4201
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Because everybody's heard of Bon Jovi

4202
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Hate me if you want

4203
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
That's not really a game I'd be interested in

4204
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
That's the problem with these games

4205
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
No matter what, no matter who the band is

4206
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
That they pick, because I'll sit here and go

4207
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
But give me Rock Band Journey and oh my god

4208
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
You know, but I realize it's still not going to sell

4209
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Any better, you know, I think

4210
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
You take the Beatles

4211
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
They are the biggest selling band of all time

4212
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Whether they are anymore or whatever

4213
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
It's just one of those, you know what?

4214
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
A game so focused on one band

4215
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Is never going to appeal to a mass market

4216
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
But Rob, if they gave you the choice

4217
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
If they said, okay, hey, we're going to release

4218
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Rock Band Journey as a standalone game

4219
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Or you can download all the songs

4220
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
You probably download all the songs

4221
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I would like it better if I could download all the songs

4222
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And like a Journey themed background or something

4223
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Fair enough

4224
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
You know what I mean? Like something to kind of add into the Rock Band experience

4225
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Which I'm kind of surprised they haven't done

4226
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Like, you know, you have all these track packs

4227
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Or whatever, why not have like a

4228
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
You know, no doubt themed arena

4229
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
To go with the CD or something like that, you know?

4230
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I'm glad you asked that question, and the reason why

4231
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Is because they have each song

4232
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
They have programmed in

4233
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Different camera cuts and stuff

4234
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Depending on which stage they're in

4235
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
And if they add another stage, they go back and edit

4236
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Every single song to add that stage into it

4237
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Interesting

4238
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I always thought it was just more generic than that

4239
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Like, you know, cut here, cut here, or whatever

4240
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
No. Interesting

4241
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Rob, you're right about that

4242
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
You wouldn't buy the game, but

4243
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
What I see is this

4244
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
If it was out of like ten people

4245
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Maybe eight people would buy

4246
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
The Bon Jovi game compared to maybe like

4247
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Six would buy the Journey themed game

4248
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
You see what I'm saying?

4249
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Go with a band that more people would probably buy

4250
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Because it's a given

4251
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
100% is not going to buy

4252
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
A band themed game

4253
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Because not everybody is behind them, you know?

4254
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Here's the thing though

4255
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I think there are very, very, very few

4256
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
And I know I've gotten into this on the show before

4257
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
So you've probably heard this feel before

4258
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
There are very, very few bands

4259
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
And artists that

4260
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Can justify an entire release

4261
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
For their brand

4262
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
And the Beatles were

4263
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Certainly one of them

4264
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Michael Jackson is another

4265
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
And there's probably nobody else

4266
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
In that top tier, to be honest

4267
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I don't think there is any other band or musical

4268
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Act that fits into that same caliber

4269
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
As Michael Jackson and the Beatles. None

4270
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Now you go down to the next tier

4271
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
And that's where you get your

4272
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Bon Jovis and your

4273
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Van Halen's and your

4274
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Aerosmith and Metallica

4275
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
But I don't even think

4276
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Green Day fits into that tier

4277
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Honestly, I was too fond of

4278
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Green Day being in that tier

4279
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
In that tier above. I don't even think

4280
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Aerosmith was more deserving than Metallica

4281
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
If you'll ask me, but that's just my opinion

4282
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Right, and then it just

4283
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Starts to get into opinions

4284
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
But you just have to look at history, record sales

4285
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
How many t-shirts of the band's name have been sold

4286
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
I think Metallica

4287
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
And Aerosmith are about even, it's just different

4288
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Crowds. Pretty much

4289
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
So, but I think

4290
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
That very very top tier

4291
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
There's nobody in it but the Beatles and Michael Jackson

4292
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Nobody has that same kind of

4293
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Pull. And now we see

4294
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
What we're getting, I mean Michael Jackson

4295
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Just never really worked right for a rock band

4296
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Kind of set up, so now we see

4297
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
What we're getting instead, which I don't know if

4298
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
It's the best idea, but I won't see

4299
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
For real until I get to play the game

4300
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
I'm interested, I gotta say

4301
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
I find the idea of a Michael Jackson

4302
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Dance-y type just dance game

4303
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
More appealing than some of the other dance

4304
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Games I've seen

4305
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Well, I mean, I've seen people

4306
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Play, I think it's pretty fun. Me personally, if I'm gonna

4307
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Sit there and play it, I'm gonna get the official

4308
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Loafers and the glove and the jacket

4309
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
And just rock out with my cock out, you know

4310
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Hey, hold on there, Michael Jackson got in trouble

4311
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
For that. Alright. Yeah, but I'm an

4312
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Adult, so it's okay. Alright

4313
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Alright, we gotta let you go buddy

4314
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
But I appreciate the discussion, it was good

4315
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Come on buddy. You too, later

4316
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Later

4317
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000

4319
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
GioVidea says, I want Billy Joel for rock band

4320
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Hey, good news GioVidea, they're gonna do like

4321
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
This huge Billy Joel track pack

4322
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Keyboards and all

4323
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
I believe December-ish

4324
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Early December-ish

4325
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Is when it's coming, and I'm talking like

4326
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
It's like ten songs, so

4327
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
That should be very exciting, correct?

4328
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
I don't know

4329
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Should we go to more calls, or

4330
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Last minute stories, or what are we gonna do here?

4331

4333
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
You wanna throw out a last minute story real quick, Logan?

4334
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Yeah, sure, let's do that

4335
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Okay, I'm trying to think

4336
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Oh, this is kinda cool

4337
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
I saw this actually

4338
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
You know that game, Super Mario crossover

4339
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Well of course they're doing another update

4340
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
For it, and they're adding the blaster master

4341
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Vehicle as

4342
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
One of the characters you can play as

4343
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Yeah, I saw that on the Twitter, somebody tweeted that

4344
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
To us this week, I saw that, that's cool

4345
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Yes, very very cool, so

4346
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
That update is not yet live

4347
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
But it will be coming soon though

4348
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I actually played a little bit of that game before

4349
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
The show with the last update

4350
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Ryu from Ninja Gaiden

4351
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
So

4352
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Very cool

4353
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Alright, hold on, our phones are lighting up like all at once now

4354
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Let me go take some calls, hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio

4355
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Who's this?

4356
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Hi, this is Pazinator

4357
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Hi everybody

4358
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Yeah, a couple of things that I

4359
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Didn't get around to tweeting to you

4360
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
For

4361
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
They're all kinda interrelated

4362
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
First off

4363
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Right off the top of my list

4364
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
For those of us

4365
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
That have access to a PlayStation 3

4366
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
And the PlayStation Network

4367
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
There's another

4368
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Free anime

4369
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Episode currently on the store

4370
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
It's called

4371
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Saigon the Complete Series Episode 1

4372
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
The 60 Billion

4373
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Double Dollar Man

4374
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Hey, let me ask you this

4375
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
How do you keep tabs on

4376
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
All this free stuff that's coming out

4377
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Is this you just checking the store kinda every Wednesday

4378
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
When they do the updates, or is there like a blog

4379
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
That kinda tracks all the free shit on

4380
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
PSN

4381
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
There's no blog that I'm aware of

4382
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
That tracks all the free stuff

4383
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
It's just that

4384
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
I was like self-censoring, did you hear that?

4385
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Yeah

4386
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I just hate to say it

4387
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
But I got no life

4388
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
And I'm constantly

4389
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Checking things on the store

4390
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
You know what, it's okay

4391
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
When Game Room was still new and fresh

4392
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
And the games were really notable

4393
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Every Wednesday, I would plop on the couch

4394
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
And run over and see what came out

4395
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
And Virtual Console, it was new too

4396
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
No worries, dude

4397
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Yeah, I really won't

4398
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Get into my opinion of

4399
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
The free show cause

4400
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Why I think of the show may differ from

4401
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
What you or Jeannie or Loki

4402
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Would think of the show

4403
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
My own opinion

4404
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Would probably be irrelevant

4405
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Sum it up into one sentence

4406
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Basically

4407
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
It's a free show

4408
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Even if you download it

4409
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
And hate the show

4410
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
It's free

4411
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
That was a perfect sentence, Spaznator

4412
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
It's a free show

4413
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Perfect, perfect

4414
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Alright

4415
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
On a relaying note, for those of us

4416
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
In our age group

4417
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
That grew up with it

4418
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
They just

4419
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Start putting, of all things

4420
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
He-Man and Masters of the Universe

4421
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
On the PlayStation Network

4422
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Dude, really? Is She-Ra up yet?

4423
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Not yet

4424
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
But at this rate, I'm wondering if it

4425
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Goes up there soon

4426
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
They don't have all the episodes

4427
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Up yet, just 33

4428
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
But damn, damn it all

4429
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I, I grew up

4430
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
You know, watching that show

4431
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Religiously, I mean, you know

4432
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Dad and Voltron and Transformers

4433
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I mean, you know, I practically

4434
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Had a orgasm once I realized

4435
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
They went up on the store and

4436
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Granted, you know, the first

4437
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
One on the store was, you know, they had

4438
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
A fail at the same time, 99 cents

4439
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Each, you know, I grabbed

4440
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
What I could afford and

4441
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
I was blessed, sorry

4442
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Only two episodes

4443
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
But as soon as I came

4444
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I'm gonna snatch up the rest

4445
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
And, you know, if only

4446
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
They put up like Gia, Joe

4447
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
And the rest of the

4448
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Episodes of Transformers

4449
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
You know, season two and onward

4450
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
You know, I'd be a

4451
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Happy camper, you know?

4452
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Hey, Gia Videa is saving the day for me and pointing out

4453
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
That She-Ra is at least on Netflix

4454
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
So you can get it on your PS3

4455
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
You know, when they switch to digital

4456
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
TV and stuff right here and we started getting all those weird

4457
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
.2 channels

4458
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

4459
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
There is actually a channel, I don't remember what it's called now

4460
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
But in the Sacramento area that plays

4461
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Old cartoons like that

4462
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
They even play the original Ghostbusters cartoon

4463
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Not the 80s cartoon

4464
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
But the one that actually predated the movies

4465
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
You know, like from the 70s

4466
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Uh, what, who's station

4467
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Is that Fox's number two?

4468
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I don't remember

4469
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
It's not the more or

4470
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
It, it

4471
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
My friend actually watches

4472
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
A lot of that stuff

4473
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Voltron and stuff

4474
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
One of them, the Fox affiliate here had a

4475
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Second channel that was nothing

4476
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
But music videos

4477
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
It was like what MTV should have been

4478
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
But that went away, it only lasted like four years

4479
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
If you haven't checked it out

4480
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Because not all cable companies pick them up

4481
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Get your HDTV to search for signals in the area

4482
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Because that's kind of part of the cool thing about HDTV

4483
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Now your NBC station

4484
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Only ever had one channel

4485
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
But now they have like three or four

4486
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Some of them

4487
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
And some of them are weird, like we have this one, it's like

4488
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
More TV Sacramento where they play these random movies

4489
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Like these strangest movies out there

4490
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Some of them are gonna be like Gospel

4491
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
And some of them are nothing but the Weather Channel

4492
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
But local, but there's some

4493
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
You'll find some weird shit out there

4494
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Sorry

4495
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

4496
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I can't really knock

4497
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Because I never used it

4498
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
So I can't really say anything positive or negative

4499
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
About it until I use it

4500
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
You know

4501
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
The thing is with me

4502
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
In order to use it I would have to get a credit card

4503
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
I don't have one currently

4504
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
So I'm basically stuck

4505
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Buying things off of

4506
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Either Xbox Live

4507
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Zoom Marketplace

4508
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Or TSN

4509
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
And in a way

4510
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
It kind of works out

4511
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
In a way

4512
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
It may be

4513
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Kind of expensive

4514
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Depending on how you look at

4515
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Compared to other

4516
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Ways of getting stuff

4517
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
But at the same time

4518
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
It's also cheaper

4519
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
At least in the sense that

4520
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
You can buy the stuff piecemeal

4521
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Low over time

4522
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Over an extended period of time

4523
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
And not only that

4524
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
But at least

4525
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Compared to getting

4526
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Stuff on BluRay

4527
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Or DVD or whatever

4528
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Where you're basically stuck

4529
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Every episode of

4530
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
One particular season

4531
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Where you really only want

4532
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Let's say an episode of

4533
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Five of whatever series

4534
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Well it's nice if nothing else

4535
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
At least there's different options

4536
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Out there

4537
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Yeah

4538
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Granted

4539
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
TSN's not perfect

4540
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
I've been on board

4541
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
On the show multiple times complaining

4542
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
About here and there

4543
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
But at least

4544
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
It's out there

4545
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
It's something you can do at least

4546
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Alright Spaznator we're going to let you go so we wrap up

4547
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
The show but thanks so much for your call

4548
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Really appreciate it

4549
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Have a good one buddy

4550
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Alright that's going to do it for the skype line tonight

4551
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Sorry to those that didn't get through

4552
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
And if you're sitting there going why is it always the same people

4553
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Every week to get through on skype

4554
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Because you're not calling us

4555
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
So if you're mad at hearing the same people

4556
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Every week you've got to give us a call

4557
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
1-877-GAME-OL-R or remember there are

4558
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Other ways you can interact with the show

4559
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
If you're like shy and you're like I don't want any people

4560
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
To hear my voice hehe

4561
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Or you don't want your parents knowing that you're calling that's fine

4562
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Give us an email mailbag at orange lounge radio

4563
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Dot com we don't want you to get in trouble

4564
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
You can also send us tweets

4565
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
This is the show where every gamer has a voice

4566
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
We want to make sure you are heard

4567
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Anyhow any more last minute stories

4568
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
We want to get to tonight Loki before we wrap things up

4569
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Yeah one

4570
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
One other thing here

4571
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Halo Wars they're turning off the servers

4572
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
December 15th I heard about that

4573
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
So that sucks and the game's not that old

4574
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Either and

4575
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Apparently yeah

4576
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Barely two years old Microsoft

4577
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Is pulling the plug on Halo Wars

4578
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Getting rid of the leaderboard and stat

4579
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Tracking as well as the forums

4580
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
They're just

4581
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Throwing it all away aren't they

4582
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
They are forums that expensive to maintain

4583
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Really

4584
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
It says community was informed that on Tuesday

4585
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
They were also told that they were transitioning

4586
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
To the Halo Waypoint forums

4587
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Which is a nice way of saying

4588
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
That halowars.com

4589
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Is going away

4590
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
So it says

4591
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
More importantly the forums will disappear

4592
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
And so will online stat tracking

4593
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
And it says

4594
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I know this will be rough on a lot of you guys

4595
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
This is from one of the forum mods

4596
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
And here's some of the comments

4597
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Game is dead. Fuck you. No stat tracking

4598
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
You just killed this game. Fuck you

4599
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
They are cheap bastards

4600
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I'm buying this domain when they let it go lol

4601
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
And it says possibly the most

4602
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Close knit video game

4603
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Forum community is going to be tossed

4604
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
With a bunch of reach junkies

4605
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Doh

4606
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
So sad

4607
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
So TigerClaw sent me this link he wanted me to play

4608
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
For you Loki

4609
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
You might recognize this

4610
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Wow this is old

4611
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I was thinking about the ghostbusters

4612
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
And the real ghostbusters but I didn't even

4613
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Know there was this really old one

4614
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
We used to watch this all the time

4615
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
My little brothers loved it

4616
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
And when we were really really little

4617
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
We had this

4618
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
It was a garage that had been converted to a

4619
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Playroom and they'd take

4620
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
This big chair and put a driving wheel in front

4621
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Of it and try to beat the car

4622
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Nice

4623
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
JeremyTaw1 in our chat room is kind of pissed about

4624
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
This story that Loki just reported on

4625
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
I'm sorry but this whole server pulling thing

4626
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Is bullshit. Someone pays 60 bucks

4627
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
For a game should be able to play it online

4628
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
For at least a few years without them

4629
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Turning it off. Now here's the thing though

4630
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
I don't think it says that they're taking down the online

4631
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
They're taking down the leaderboards and stat tracking

4632
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
All the frills that come on the website

4633
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
I still think you can play online

4634
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Because it's Microsoft's live servers

4635
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
I can't imagine they'd take those down

4636
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
What else do you pay for gold for?

4637
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
The other quick thing I wanted to throw out here

4638
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
That Tigerclaw had sent us

4639
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Was about the video game awards on

4640
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Spike TV. I guess the nominees have been announced

4641
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
But I'm kind of like

4642
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Are these really relevant?

4643
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
The only reason why the video game awards

4644
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Are really relevant at all

4645
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Is that they show commercials for new games

4646
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
And get new game announcements during the show

4647
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
And I guess, I don't know

4648
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
It kind of tries to bring this like

4649
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Legitimacy quote unquote

4650
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
To the video game scene but I'm just kind of like

4651
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Eh, I don't need it

4652
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
But for the record if you're curious what they nominated

4653
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Game of the Year, Call of Duty Black Ops

4654
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
God of War 3, Halo Reach, Mass Effect 2

4655
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Red Dead Redemption

4656
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Those are the nominees for Game of the Year

4657
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Okay, no surprises there

4658
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Any other last minute stories, Loki?

4659
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
I think that's

4660
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
About it

4661
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Fan made Thief 2

4662
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Multiplayer beta has been released

4663
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
So if you're a fan of Thief 2

4664
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
And wish that you could have played it with more than one person

4665
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Then you might want to check it out

4666
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Alright

4667
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Well it's time for us to wrap up the show

4668
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
And get on out of here for the night

4669
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
And you know, so forth

4670
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
So Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts

4671
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
For our listeners tonight?

4672
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Money, I can have some?

4673
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Pinkberry!

4674
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Aw man, you just took mine, I was gonna say

4675
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
My final thought is Pinkberry, can I have some?

4676
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
But I'll just say

4677
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Four day vacation, can I has it?

4678
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Loki, your final thought tonight

4679
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
My final thought

4680
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Is

4681
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
I get to make turkey

4682
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Turducken?

4683
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
No, it's just turkey

4684
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Turducken's just too, I don't think that'd be too much

4685
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
What are you doing, are you

4686
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Since both you and the missus

4687
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Have parents locally, you kind of have to do like

4688
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Two thanksgivings at once, right?

4689
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Not necessarily, we're just having our way over to our house

4690
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Oh, smart

4691
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Smart, alright, good luck with that this year

4692
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Alright, that's it guys, we're

4693
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Out of here, have a wonderful night

4694
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
And we'll see you next week, hey if you enjoyed

4695
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
The show tonight, all we ask guys

4696
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Tell a couple people about the show

4697
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Tell folks that you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio

4698
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
And help us spread the word, because you know guys

4699
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
We don't have a huge website, we're not part

4700
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Of a gaming magazine or anything like that

4701
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
We rely on word of mouth, so

4702
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Tell a couple people about the show, and if you think you've told

4703
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Everyone you can already, then please

4704
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Consider leaving us a nice review on iTunes

4705
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
A five star review goes a long way in helping us

4706
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Get the word out and more exposure on the network

4707
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Really appreciate it guys

4708
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Have a wonderful night and we'll see you next time

4709
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Next week here at Orange Lounge Radio

Have a wonderful Thanksgiving to those of you in the

US that celebrate it, to everyone else

4712

Well have a great week and we'll see you on Sunday

4713
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
