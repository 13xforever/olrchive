00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, November 28th, 2010, BBC programming comes to video game consoles courtesy of PlayStation

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,120
Network, could indie games soon feature the Kinect, and another musician sues the makers

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,920
of Guitar Hero.

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,240
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,500
Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,380
It is episode number 391 for November 28th of 2010.

7
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,380
My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,560
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts, the one and only

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,120
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,560
I had balls.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,280
Well, we want to go there this early in the show.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,680
They were meaty and tangy.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
You're talking about meatballs.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
Yeah, barbecue meatballs.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,000
Where did you get some barbecue meatballs?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
From my husband.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I ate his balls.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,080
You got to eat his balls.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,040
You wouldn't even let me lick his balls.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
You can lick them.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
There's some left.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
Okay, good.

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
I'll lick them later.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
He's got a lot of balls.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
All right.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
Anyway, let's also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Hello.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,800
I need to ask if you have any interest in licking Dan's balls.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,960
No, I'm quite full on eating... was it garlic parmesan twists?

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,920
You're downing the sticks over there, I see.

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
No interest in the balls.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
That's fine.

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
They're twists, okay?

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
They're not sticks.

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,040
How is your parmesan twists?

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
They're okay.

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,200
They were late, though, because I got... they said 15 to 20 minutes, got there 30 minutes

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
later.

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
It should have been done by now.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,240
I get there and they're like, oh, yeah, we forgot to put them in the oven.

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,840
Well, that doesn't help me out any.

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,640
It's like, fucking put it in the oven.

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
We're sorry.

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,560
Did you get it like a discount or a coupon or...

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Fuck no.

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Here's what ended up happening.

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,520
I could tell you exactly what happened because I've been there because some stupid employee

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,800
did it before.

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,920
What happened was my twists were probably done, but there was another order that also

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,960
had an order of twists, and so they just took it for that order.

51
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,240
Oh, not cool.

52
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Yeah.

53
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Not cool.

54
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
All right.

55
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,440
Next up with us is the chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,760
Going to Breakman in our chat room starts us off tonight.

57
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,320
Every gamer has a voice.

58
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,760
Just please don't embarrass the rest of us.

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,080
I think that sums it up very well, actually.

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
Thank you, Breakman.

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,080
We do have another guest here in studio.

62
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,600
We are very excited to have her on the show.

63
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,360
She's a good friend of Dark Sakura.

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,240
She's known for a very long time, and I love her to bits, too.

65
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,840
And Loki, I don't think they ever really hang out, but they'd probably be besties if they

66
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
did.

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
Let's move on to Marissa.

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
How are you?

69
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
Hi, kiddies.

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
How are you?

71
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm good.

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
How are you?

73
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Good.

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
And do you have a nickname that you use that we should call you?

75
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,760
Well, I always go and buy Marissa con gusto, but my boyfriend prefers to call me Marissa

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
con busto.

77
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
That's right.

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,840
Here's the thing, and it's a bummer we don't have the webcam anymore, but Marissa has big

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
boobs.

80
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,200
Oh, my God.

81
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,880
They're so big.

82
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
They're awesome.

83
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,160
But we love them.

84
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,040
And she also has a big brain, everybody, to go with it.

85
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
Thank you.

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,680
So don't just stare.

87
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,280
The extra boobs are to hold extra brains.

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,600
That's right.

89
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Exactly.

90
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,920
And do you even play video games, or are you just kind of here for the lulz?

91
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Both.

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,560
You know, actually, I listen every week, and I've always dated people that are really into

93
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,880
games, but I'm kind of an old school gamer, and I'm just going to wait for eternity for

94
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,040
another King's Quest to come out, and Thief is never going to come out.

95
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,040
I don't care what they say.

96
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,760
Okay, you can stay, because Retro Game, especially if you're going to go straight to King's Quest,

97
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,360
which is some of the holy grail of PC games, and you know, we've actually had a lot of

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,660
talk about the, and you may not even know this is out here, the fan-made King's Quest,

99
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,660
the silver lining.

100
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,660
I've heard about that.

101
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, it's totally free, and I think they're on the second episode now, and Roberta Williams,

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,760
even though I think she lives out in the woods in a fort now and has totally disavowed all

103
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
the gaming industry.

104
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,600
The fort?

105
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,040
That might be her fort, actually, out there in the wilderness.

106
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,120
All I know is that she wants nothing to do with the gaming industry in this day and age,

107
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,880
but she actually kind of gave it a blessing without giving it her blessing, like legally.

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,680
It's basically like, hey, I'm not going to make any more of that series until I need

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
more money.

110
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,920
Kind of like how JK Rowling's, I'm not going to make any more books, but maybe I could

111
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,880
revisit the world at some point, when I start running out of money, of course.

112
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,080
I love adventure games, and that's always been my thing, but there's all this hype about

113
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Siberia coming out, and that's like, to sit like no one ever boldly sat before a game.

114
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,280
I bet you would like some of the stuff that Telltale does, because they're trying to make

115
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,880
that live on with the whole Sam and Max games, they've got the Back to the Future games coming

116
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
out soon.

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,680
I bet you that type of stuff would be right up their alley.

118
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,200
We need to get you and Seg here on the same night, because he works there, and he could

119
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,840
sell you much better than I could.

120
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Love Sam and Max.

121
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
All right.

122
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Anyhow, I just have to go to the chat room.

123
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,560
I just want to give you a taste at the chatters.

124
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
All right.

125
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm not even going to read the names here.

126
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Here we go.

127
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
You ready?

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Let's see.

129
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,520
Oh, actually, I will say Jessica Harper said, bigger than mine, possibly.

130
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
I think so.

131
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,840
I think you might both have to whip them out, and we'll see.

132
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,920
Whoever wins this contest doesn't actually win, if you know what I mean.

133
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,560
But here's some of the other comments.

134
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,320
Awesomely big, big boobs, the mighty rack, take a photo and post it in the OLR gallery,

135
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,440
OMG boobs.

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,080
Her boobs have brains in them.

137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
Everybody likes boobs.

138
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Boobs.

139
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Balls.

140
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,240
That's what the show's turned into tonight.

141
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,600
Picks of tits or get the fuck out.

142
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
That was from a girl.

143
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Just so you know.

144
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,640
My boyfriend tells me tits are get-foes, so it's okay.

145
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Is it weird?

146
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
No, wait.

147
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
No, I lied.

148
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
That was from a boy.

149
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,080
So, but still, they want picks.

150
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,200
Is it weird that I'm the one that's keeping the show grounded at this point?

151
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,560
I mean, is that strange to you?

152
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,720
I mean, clearly there was some type of crack cocaine in our turkey for the Thanksgiving

153
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
holiday.

154
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
I hope you all had a pleasant Thanksgiving.

155
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,080
I hope you didn't, you know, get in a car wreck or anything.

156
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,000
But if you're listening to the show, you must be fine.

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,480
So congratulations, and I hope you had a wonderful one.

158
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
It's not a girl.

159
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Don't kiss me.

160
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
No, I know.

161
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,200
It seems we're all running together, and I read it as somebody else.

162
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Sorry.

163
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
It's live radio.

164
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,360
I don't always do well at it, even though it's only been, what, nine years.

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,480
So anyway, Marissa's gonna join us tonight and Lowell with us, and Shirley, if you have

166
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
any input, you just jump right in there.

167
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,080
And you will have no problem jumping right in there.

168
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,720
We might play a game later, too, in part B, so that'll be fun.

169
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,000
We'll get the chatters involved, and it'll be a good time.

170
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's called Guess Marissa's Cup Size.

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, stop.

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Stop.

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That would be a hard one.

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Do you...

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We don't want to...

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Ha ha, pun.

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Sorry.

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You've done it with me.

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sorry.

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,640
I don't want to give Marissa a complex or make people think it's only about her boobs,

181
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,360
because actually, you are a musician, correct?

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Yes.

183
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
You do.

184
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
And what type of music do you do?

185
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,400
Well, I do a neo-folk-pop thing, but as most...

186
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Neo-folk-pop.

187
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah.

188
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,640
It's like, acoustic is probably the better word, because you say folky, and people think

189
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,360
like Peter, Paul, and Mary, you know.

190
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,640
So like, Jewel, do you yodel?

191
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,240
Um, well, uh, no.

192
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Okay.

193
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,880
Because if you said yes, I was going to make you do it.

194
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,140
I think, you know, most musicians nowadays specialize in being broke, so that's my feel.

195
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,920
You are actually the definition of starving LA artist, correct?

196
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,720
What's that old joke?

197
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,960
What do you call a musician without a girlfriend?

198
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Homeless.

199
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,600
Because I have the opposite situation.

200
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,920
All right.

201
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,960
Well, you know what?

202
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,320
I've heard some of your stuff, and I know you've got talent, and it's just, that moment

203
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
will come.

204
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Someday.

205
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
That moment will come.

206
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
All right.

207
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,440
But I love the whole folk-pop thing.

208
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
That's amazing.

209
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
All right.

210
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,400
Anyhow, let's get into talking about our gaming weeks.

211
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
We always start off the show talking about what's going on in our gaming world this week,

212
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
so we'll go to Dark Sakura.

213
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,920
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

214
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:29,120
Well, we played some Rock Band of the Beatles and Three Variety, and Marissa belted out

215
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:42,320
a good one, and some Star Trek Online, a lot of games on my phone, that's about it.

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
All right.

217
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,440
You look amused, like you're about to laugh about something.

218
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,860
It's just chat and boobs, and the show amuses me.

219
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,000
It's okay to laugh.

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,720
I am wearing my Silent Hill shirt, though.

221
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I'm very happy.

222
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Yes, you are.

223
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Because it's cold.

224
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
I could wear my Silent Hill shirt.

225
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,440
At least it's not foggy, then that might be the right kind of atmosphere.

226
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
It was the other day.

227
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Was it?

228
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Yes, it was.

229
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
It was quite foggy last night.

230
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
All right.

231
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Well, let's go to Loki.

232
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
How was your gaming week?

233
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Anything new or exciting?

234
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
No.

235
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Unfortunately not.

236
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
It really is.

237
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,680
Just Grand Theft Auto this week, and Stick Wars on my iPod.

238
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,640
That was about it, I mean, really.

239
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,120
What is Stick Wars?

240
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,760
Stick Wars, remember that game, Defender Castle, where you take little stick figures and throw

241
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
them into the air?

242
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
You told me a little bit about this last week.

243
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,800
Yeah, it's basically like a knockoff of that, and then, so I've been playing it forever

244
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,000
now, and yeah, it's really it.

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,320
I mean, I don't know, I haven't been able to do much else because I had to make dinner

246
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,040
for Thanksgiving, and then I had to put up Christmas lights, and put up a tree, and...

247
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,660
Well, it sounds like you didn't have much of a holiday.

248
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,480
You had more of a working past few days.

249
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,560
And fixed my sister's computer because she got like 65 different things of spyware on

250
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
there.

251
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,660
That takes talent.

252
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,120
How many porn sites does one have to visit to get all of that spyware installed?

253
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
I just reinstalled Windows.

254
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,160
It's my old laptop that I used to bring in.

255
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,360
Thankfully, because I was like, well, I hate the fact that this has a super recovery partition.

256
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,280
I love the fact that that has a super recovery partition because all I did was, eh, fuck

257
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,460
it, I don't care, back up, and it'll just erase everything out of there, reinstall Windows

258
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,400
with all the stuff that was on there from when I got it, and any files that were important

259
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,680
get backed up into a folder, delete everything else, and we're good.

260
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,640
So I can reinstall Windows like super quick.

261
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
It's awesome.

262
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,920
But, yeah, that's pretty much all I was doing.

263
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,160
I was hoping to play some Connect stuff, never got around to that.

264
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,040
In fact, I can't now because I moved the coffee table to put the tree in.

265
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,240
So I don't have room anymore to play Connect in my living room.

266
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,460
You notice I notice a lot of people complaining about the amount of space that Connect requires,

267
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,160
that for a lot of people it actually isn't practical.

268
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,520
I've noticed that kind of buzz around the internet lately, like a lot of people complaining

269
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
about the space you need.

270
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,560
Well, it's just that coffee table, I don't like it anymore.

271
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,440
You know, it's a coffee table I got from my grandparents, I mean it's old, and it's really

272
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
cumbersome.

273
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm thinking of getting two ottomans instead and just sitting them next to each other for

274
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,160
a coffee table, and that way we can use them as seating as well if we need to, and we can

275
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,240
move them out of the way a lot easier.

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,480
It's just that set of furniture is just really old.

277
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,320
But anyways, yeah, so not that I was really going to be able to play Connect stuff anyways,

278
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,760
I know I get a lot of time to play games at home, but at work though I can.

279
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,240
In fact, it's funny, some of my co-workers, they're in charge of, oh, here's something

280
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,800
else I forgot to mention last week, it was hilarious.

281
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,160
Holy slit my mind.

282
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,920
I actually rode a mechanical bull last week.

283
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
What?

284
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,360
Yes, our work, they do these parties once a month or whatever at the end of each month.

285
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,760
So last week was technically the end of the month because we weren't there this week.

286
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,000
And you rode a mechanical bull?

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah.

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,880
So it was more like a drunken sorority party then?

289
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
No.

290
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Okay.

291
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,280
It was funny because I wanted to see, you know, I wanted to do it better than everybody

292
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
else.

293
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Sure, of course.

294
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
And how long did you last?

295
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
I did really well actually.

296
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,480
In fact, I was taunting the guy that was operating it, and so he did a really difficult ride,

297
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,240
and I kicked the crap out of it, so it was fun.

298
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,600
So you just have to hold on and...

299
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Pretty much.

300
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,960
It was pretty easy.

301
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,960
No, but other than that, just a lot more, you know, Dance Central.

302
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,920
Actually, I did play a little bit of Dance Central during work, just some of the few

303
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
songs on there.

304
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm thinking of getting some of the download content, but I'm gonna have to wait until

305
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,760
I upgrade certain systems.

306
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,960
You do know there are very, very few people out there listening to the show or anywhere

307
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,720
that can say, I played Dance Central at work?

308
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,480
Well, on my break, you know.

309
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,040
No, I know, but still, this is funny.

310
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,640
And then of course, still working on editing Grand Theft Auto stuff, and then yesterday

311
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,640
I was messing with...

312
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
It's not even really a game.

313
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:16,100
Well, I consider it a game because I'm getting free money for exploiting a website.

314
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,280
So that was kind of a game.

315
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,640
This is a website, appredeem.com.

316
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:27,440
You download free apps, paid apps, or if you have a jailbroken phone, free apps, and they

317
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
give you money.

318
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
Interesting.

319
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,520
Like straight into your PayPal account.

320
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,640
This sounds like one of those free iPod schemes.

321
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,760
It's not a scheme though, but here's the thing.

322
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,600
I guess they're trying to entice you to buy the apps, but if you really don't want to,

323
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,360
you just put in your PayPal account, the email that you use for your PayPal account, and

324
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,520
you can just go download the free apps and you get like $1.50 for free.

325
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Weird.

326
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,720
So, you don't even have to buy any of the paid apps, just download the free ones.

327
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
It's a free dollar.

328
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,200
I mean, who would not want free money?

329
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,360
The apps do suck though.

330
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,280
They're terrible apps.

331
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,160
I was going to say, do they pay you to give that little plug here on our show?

332
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,360
No, I just thought it was cool because it's free money.

333
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,860
See, if I was trying to exploit everything, I would give out a link or something that

334
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,560
would have like some sort of referral thing or something where I'd get credit for it,

335
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
but I don't care.

336
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,200
So, I'm just saying though that, I mean, all you do is download these apps, you go into

337
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,600
them for like a second, go back to the website, you get credit for it, delete the app, you're

338
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
done.

339
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Wow.

340
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
All right.

341
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Anyways.

342
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Well, anything, yeah.

343
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,840
I like this comment in our chat room, Act Def says, a week later, my PayPal account

344
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
got hacked.

345
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,560
I don't think they can hack your PayPal account by just giving them an email address, and

346
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,560
it doesn't have to...

347
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Or use a different one.

348
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Yeah, exactly.

349
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
It doesn't have to be.

350
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,200
I didn't realize it was, they were going to use that email address as a PayPal account,

351
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,320
so I'd actually create a second PayPal account for the email address that I gave them, so

352
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
whatever.

353
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
All right.

354
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,200
I'll just send it to my original PayPal account.

355
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
All right.

356
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

357
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
That's it.

358
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
All right.

359
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,480
Marissa, I don't know if you've been playing any games recently, but I thought I'd ask

360
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
if there's anything.

361
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,600
I know you have one of those, don't you have like one of those fancy Windows phones now

362
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
or something?

363
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
I don't know.

364
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,640
Maybe you've been playing games on that.

365
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,920
You don't put the word fancy and Windows phone together.

366
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,400
Well, they have this new thing there.

367
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,680
Maybe it's like the new Windows phone they're really pushing, but it's this whole like Xbox

368
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,320
Live integration, and it's trying to compete with the iPhone.

369
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Excuse me.

370
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Yeah.

371
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
I, yeah.

372
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,760
I have a Touch Pro 2, and nobody cares anything for it, and it's Sprint, but I only pay, you

373
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,920
know, 35 bucks a month, so I'll deal with it, but I've, I don't know, I've heard just

374
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,520
within the community, because I was looking, you know, like I'm ineligible for any upgrades

375
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,560
even though the hardware is capable of it, which stinks, but HTC makes a good phone,

376
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,960
so at least I know that everything else is solid.

377
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,400
And I lost my rock band, Virginity, to Jamie.

378
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Nice.

379
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
So.

380
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,080
So did you, you actually did some of the singing in the game?

381
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,960
The singing, I played a guitar and bass, and I guess I have to go back and now tell my

382
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,220
musician friends who are always bitching about it that they appreciate it.

383
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,280
This is where I wanted to go with this, because a lot of musicians, I'm glad you brought this

384
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,420
up, because a lot of musicians like to razz on rock band because it's not really playing

385
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:20,000
an instrument, and it's like dumbing down music, and did you feel that way, or were

386
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,920
you like, no, this is just, this is just fun and nothing else?

387
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,000
In a really abstract way, I could see how like for, like a little kid, you know, like

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,280
maybe you should just actually give them an instrument before just, I mean, if they, if

389
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,180
they have a musical instrument, you should probably give them a real instrument and let

390
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,160
them explore that, as opposed to just trying to virtually experience that, but like you're,

391
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,120
you know, otherwise, I mean, the game is great, and it's a lot of fun, and as opposed to what

392
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,720
a lot of people think, you have to appreciate the music in order to really enjoy the game.

393
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,320
I mean, because the game by itself is entertaining, but again, we really have to enjoy the music

394
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
to get all your money's worth.

395
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
It's fun.

396
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Yeah.

397
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,840
So, and I don't know if you got to see any of this, but, well, probably not, because

398
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,280
I don't think the actual guitars are out, or I don't think Jamie has them, but there's

399
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,320
actually these pro modes now in rock band where you can like learn to play the real

400
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,800
instrument, and I've been doing it for keyboard, which is kind of fun, because I used to play

401
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,720
keyboard back when I was like 12, so it's kind of fun to get back into that.

402
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,280
And you know, if you wait long enough, even though it is kind of an inferior game, according

403
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,800
to reviews, I'm sure Power Giggle will drop in price really quickly, and that has, you

404
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
know, a electric guitar with it too.

405
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
That's what I saw, actually, though.

406
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,640
The thing, though, that ticked me off about that, though, I mean, I, you know, I don't

407
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,080
know if there's the gaming part of it, but you can get a really nice starter guitar for

408
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,480
the price of that piece of crap, I'm sorry.

409
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
It's alright.

410
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Like, if you want...

411
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
We're honest here at OLR.

412
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,520
Just like for the, you know, if you want to play the game, that's fine, if you want to

413
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,680
play and even use that to learn, that's fine too, but it's way overpriced, considering

414
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,920
that you can go get a nice squire, you know.

415
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,880
I think for some people, though, it's really that interactivity, that it, being able to

416
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,880
kind of interact and get that, you know, we're a very instant gratification society, right?

417
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,080
So to pick up a guitar and just kind of strum sometimes isn't, because you're not sure if

418
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
you're doing it right.

419
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,360
Unless you're playing Green Day songs, then who cares.

420
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,480
What I think that we should do...

421
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,680
Because you know there's a whole rock band that's just Green Day.

422
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,560
I don't know how you can do that, it's only three chords.

423
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, because there's five buttons, so it works.

424
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,120
No, no, what they need to do is just have like another like contest or something, like

425
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,840
a power gig contest.

426
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,280
Once those things get cheap enough, you just smash the guitar at the end of each song.

427
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
It's fun.

428
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,680
It's like, yeah, this game sucks, but that felt good.

429
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,800
It's funny though, it's easier to smash expensive guitars than cheap ones, because the cheaper

430
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,760
ones are made out of plywood and plastic.

431
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Yeah, I know.

432
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,840
I know those cheap ones would be a lot harder to break.

433
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,680
Fine, how about like, you know, like kind of spinning around with it, throwing it javelin

434
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,360
style into a wood chipper, how about that?

435
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,200
Nice.

436
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Will it blend?

437
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,960
Alright, so good, I'm glad the musician got to try some rock bands, so will you try it

438
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
again at some point?

439
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Oh, it was so much fun.

440
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
It really was.

441
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Awesome.

442
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Awesome.

443
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
The harmony feature is really neat too.

444
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,360
Yeah, the harmony feature is kind of cool, because it's hard for some people to hear

445
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,120
the harmony, I think, and that takes a little while to kind of train your ears to be able

446
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,640
to hear that, so kind of to get that, again, instant feedback in a game like Rock Band,

447
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,900
which is what I really think it's all about.

448
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,960
It's more like that instant gratification, hey, I hit the right chord, or oh wow, I'm

449
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
way off.

450
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,720
And as I said, despite what I thought too, I mean, I wasn't as crazy as some of my other

451
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,640
friends, you have to appreciate the song to really enjoy the game, so it's a good way

452
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,560
of promoting music and enjoying music.

453
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,560
I have found some new bands through Rock Band.

454
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,160
Like there's a song I really like in Rock Band 3, Last Dance, and I'd never heard, I

455
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,320
think the band's like the Ravenettes or something, I'd never heard of them before, but I really

456
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
like the song.

457
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
I checked out their CD.

458
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
It's kind of cool.

459
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
So there you go.

460
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
All right.

461
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
My gaming week, I actually played a few different games this week, and a lot of that is thanks

462
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,840
to the Steam sale, but I'll get to that in a minute.

463
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,240
I did touch back on some of the games I played last week.

464
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,880
Now last week I'd only played demos, but this week I did just jump in and I bought the full

465
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,560
version of Super Meat Boy, which is, it's, it's pretty great.

466
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,840
I got to say it's, it's actually, I would go so far as to say it's one of the best arcade

467
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,080
games that is out there right now, period, like at all.

468
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,400
And I would have never thought that this game would fall in that category, but I love the

469
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,800
kind of like, I want to say it's almost like a WarioWare-ish game, but Mario style.

470
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,120
What I mean by that is that a lot of the levels in the game should take you no more than 30

471
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,320
seconds to beat.

472
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,260
And most of them are in the like 15 to 20 second range.

473
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,000
So it's really about like just learning the exact like right pattern to kind of beat a

474
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
level.

475
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's like playing an old Mega Man game or something.

476
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,080
I don't know.

477
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm just having a lot of fun getting extraordinarily frustrated playing Super Meat Boy when I'm

478
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,480
like two seconds away from beating a level and just screwing it up.

479
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,520
And I got to tell you, Alan was watching me play and he would, he wants to watch me play

480
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,640
just to laugh at me getting so frustrated when I get so close to beating a level and

481
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,640
then I like, oops, fall in the gear and get Super Meat Boy all chopped up or whatever.

482
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,940
So yeah, I actually think Super Meat Boy is amazing.

483
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,680
My only, I guess, complaint is that I think in some ways it's almost too hard.

484
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,200
Like there's a lot of people that are going to buy Super Meat Boy that are never going

485
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,160
to get past the second level.

486
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,060
And it's kind of unfortunate, but if you keep with it, I mean that can also be the big reward

487
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
with it.

488
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,400
Did you get to check out the internet?

489
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,080
No, I haven't got there yet.

490
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,840
I don't know if that's towards the end or what, but I'm, I'm only on like the third

491
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
level.

492
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,360
It's taken me a long time to get there too.

493
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,040
I mean, it's, it's been quite a bit of a gaming time, so, uh, I will keep trying to get there.

494
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,700
I love the warp zones that take you to the retro style levels.

495
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,840
I thought that was amazing and it has like retro music and the soundtrack is astounding.

496
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,960
I'm going to, um, for the live listeners, I'll do some of the soundtrack for break tonight,

497
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,500
but the soundtrack is astounding.

498
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,840
It is great.

499
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,240
And it's all like indie stuff.

500
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,920
I think the guy who did the soundtracks not really done any other games before.

501
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,000
So it's, um, it's great.

502
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,400
There's really only one Xbox live arcade game I'm waiting for.

503
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,120
Um, and unfortunately I don't know when it's coming out.

504
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,200
The insanely twisted shadow planet.

505
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Never heard of that.

506
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,600
You gotta watch the video for it.

507
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Okay.

508
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
It's awesome.

509
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Should I look it up right now?

510
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
What is it?

511
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay.

512
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
It's got an awesome song that goes with it.

513
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,960
It's, um, I don't even know.

514
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,120
It's not really a shooter, but you play it like a UFO.

515
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,600
It's this guy, he's a really good artist and I'm loading up insanely twisted shadow planet

516
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
debut trailer.

517
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm going to jump in the middle.

518
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Awesome.

519
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,560
Um, song goes along with it.

520
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm not hearing.

521
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh, cause I, Oh, this kind of has that, um, it was that game limbo, not braid, but the

522
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:58,720
other artsy one now it's looking like an automate or something.

523
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Planet's collide

524
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,920
like when they get down to the actual gameplay, well that's like UFOs flying this part of

525
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
the game with the UFOs flying.

526
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Yeah.

527
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
That's all part of the game.

528
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
What is this?

529
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
An arcade release?

530
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:24,160
So it looks like you're like this little UFO and you're flying through different levels

531
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
and dodging obstacles.

532
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Wow.

533
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Something that's really good.

534
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Okay.

535
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Yeah.

536
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
The art style is pretty rad on this.

537
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
I like that.

538
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
All right.

539
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:40,040
Well, I don't, this can't be a very exciting radio, but that does look pretty cool.

540
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
I like that.

541
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,920
It's like a half shooter, half, almost like the same concept of super meat boy.

542
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,260
You're trying to get through a level, get through these tricky ways.

543
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,760
I'm going to paste the link there in chat.

544
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Sorry.

545
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,360
The folks listening on podcasts, but you won't be able to get that link, but just look for

546
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,760
insanely twisted shadow planet.

547
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Interesting.

548
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,480
All right.

549
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,760
Uh, also I played more Pac-Man championship edition deluxe, which, uh, I love there's,

550
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,600
there's very, very satisfying, uh, rewards when you gobble up a train of 30 ghosts, uh,

551
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,840
I get the high score.

552
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,640
Uh, again, the music's great.

553
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,120
Kind of the same stuff I was saying last week, buying the retail version didn't really change

554
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
my opinions there.

555
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,680
I still think it's, it's a worthy upgrade if you like the last one, um, new games I

556
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,640
played this week, thanks to a steam and some of the sales going on there.

557
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,200
I did finally play poker night at the inventory cause that finally came out, which is the

558
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,220
Texas hold and poker game that features, um, uh, like some of the characters that you see

559
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:39,080
in various telltale games and, uh, valve really cause heavy from team fortress is in there.

560
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,600
Tycho is in there and strong bad.

561
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,440
So, um, it's a Texas hold them game and I've, it's, it's really kind of, that's it.

562
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,840
It's really a no frills poker game.

563
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,920
There's not a whole lot of modes.

564
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,100
There is not a multiplayer.

565
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,040
So you might be wondering, well then why would I bother with this game?

566
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,760
Well, a it's $5, right?

567
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,520
I think it's only $5 to get this game and a 10 at most.

568
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,000
I think it's only five though.

569
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,680
And there was a lot of sales going on during the pre-order.

570
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,840
I think I paid five for it like two months ago.

571
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Yeah.

572
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,120
It's, it's very, very cheap.

573
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,620
And uh, it's mostly like, I think of it as like an interactive comic strip in a way because

574
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,000
the strength of the game is really in the writing and in the voice acting.

575
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,820
And about 98% of that all comes back to strong bad, uh, pretty much anytime strong bad says

576
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,480
something it's pretty fucking funny.

577
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,080
Uh, the rest of it, like the heavy and, and the, the, the max I can kind of give and take.

578
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,240
But uh, yeah, I loved a strong bad Tycho's all right, but I dunno, there's something

579
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,400
about him where like he comes off as a real smug asshole in the game and like, I don't

580
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
know when I read...

581
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
That's exactly his character.

582
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,500
Yes, but I don't know when I read Penny Arcade, I don't quite get it as strong as I get it

583
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,400
in the Poker Night game.

584
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Even better if it was Gabe.

585
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,740
But it was, it was fine.

586
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
It's fine.

587
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,840
I mean for a $5 poker game, I more look at it as you're buying laughs.

588
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,800
If you want an actual poker game, this is not the game to get.

589
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
It's not.

590
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,040
It's a very no frills, low thing.

591
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,800
But if you want something that's, I'm gonna laugh.

592
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,960
I'm gonna waste a little time and have fun with this.

593
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,160
That's where, you know, $5 is a pretty damn good deal.

594
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,880
If they were trying to charge like 30 though for this, I'd say no way.

595
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
No way.

596
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,080
But $5 is really hard to argue with.

597
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,440
So the price is right on this one.

598
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,740
Um, but don't expect a lot of modes and extra stuff unless, unless there's like unlockable

599
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,440
things that I haven't found yet, which I wouldn't doubt at all, actually.

600
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,240
Like Latas in there and stuff.

601
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,280
I wouldn't doubt at all that there'd be some hidden shit in there that I just haven't found

602
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
yet and that's fine.

603
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,620
I, I didn't, you know, I actually bought the game.

604
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,240
I didn't get a review copy that has the little sheet that tells you how to get all the unlocks

605
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,840
that a lot of publishers do.

606
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,320
Anyhow, also another game that I got, um, Recettear, an item shop's tale, I think was

607
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
the name of the game.

608
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,160
It's, it's a PC version of a game that looks like it was done on the PlayStation 1.

609
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,840
And I don't know if it was like translated or what the deal is, but I mean, Alan summed

610
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,960
it up perfectly.

611
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,720
He was looking at it going, this game is so weeaboo.

612
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,000
Like and that's really what it is.

613
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,560
It's just this very like chibi, teehee, I'm playing a dumb girl that's opening an item

614
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:29,640
shop and I have this little fairy that helps navigate me through the complex item shop

615
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,720
stuff and we go to the village and find a hero to take us through the dungeons.

616
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,580
Like it's just like, oh my God, I'm going to barf.

617
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,560
This is so like just stupid.

618
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,480
But I will say one thing I liked about it, well, A, I bought it in a pack of like five

619
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,060
games for five bucks.

620
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,340
So like considering I paid a whole dollar for Recettear, it's hard to complain.

621
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:56,840
But B, I actually really like the idea of the game because the idea of the game is that

622
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:03,200
you're not the hero, you run the item shop in a hero's game.

623
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
It's on my wish list.

624
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,400
Which is kind of, oh, it's a bummer you didn't sign in a couple days ago and it was on sale

625
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
for like five bucks.

626
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,560
I've been too busy having fun with Marissa.

627
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,880
I guess that's fair enough.

628
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,040
Having pillow fights and talking about boobies.

629
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,840
All right.

630
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,840
So yeah, Recettear, I honestly would not pay more than five dollars for this game.

631
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,880
And even then it's like, you might want to check out a demo first to see if it's really

632
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,920
for you.

633
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,680
But some of the like, okay, I didn't even really describe the game.

634
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,400
I'm all over the place tonight, guys, sorry.

635
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,440
You run an item shop and so you can buy and sell things.

636
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,600
You can buy things from people to come in or you can sell things that you find in dungeons.

637
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,560
And in order to go into a dungeon, you hire a hero to go into the dungeon for you.

638
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,560
And I don't know, they somehow write this into the very chibi story that the item shop

639
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,400
girl is protected and she can't get hit by the monsters, but the hero can.

640
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,000
But the item shop girl will collect all the items.

641
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,680
So it's like you go dungeon exploring, collect all this trash that you sell in your shop.

642
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,480
And then it gets more complicated later on.

643
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,120
You can like fuse things together and make like, you know, super coconuts and whatever

644
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,360
it is that, you know, you sell coconuts, you sell in an item shop and like Uber mushrooms.

645
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,880
I mean, swallows carry a super coconut.

646
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,080
I don't know.

647
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,240
So is it an African swallow or European swallow?

648
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,840
I'm looking in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com and some of the folks talking about Poker Night

649
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,240
at the inventory.

650
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,000
Deathwishing says, Skye, there's Team Fortress 2 hats.

651
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,280
Yes, I have heard that there are unlocks for other games in it.

652
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,360
I did miss that.

653
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,920
So yeah, that's correct.

654
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,560
You can unlock some items that show up in other games.

655
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,600
It's pretty cool.

656
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,080
Brakeman in chat says, what the fuck?

657
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,540
Skye buys his games after heavily drinking.

658
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,160
I don't think I was drinking heavily when I bought that game, actually.

659
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
So there you go.

660
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
All right.

661
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Anyhow.

662
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Yeah.

663
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,840
So Recettear is, if you like those like chibi import PlayStation 1 games, then this is right

664
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
up your alley.

665
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,980
But if you're looking for like a serious RPG, don't bother.

666
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,980
But I like the concept.

667
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,160
I like that idea that you're not always the hero, that sometimes you're the girl running

668
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,720
the item shop who's kind of a ditz.

669
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Fun.

670
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,520
So let's move on into housekeeping tonight before we get into the news.

671
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,680
In our housekeeping tonight, we still have shows scheduled through the end of the year.

672
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,760
We don't have any weeks off or anything.

673
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,120
Sadly, it does not look like Dark Soccer and I are going to be taking a trip mid-December

674
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,640
as we originally planned because stupid economy and all that stuff.

675
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,320
But that's why we had to get Marissa up here this time.

676
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,120
But we will still be bringing you much OLR through the rest of the year.

677
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,520
If you like the show and we hope you do, please consider adding us on Twitter.

678
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,480
We're also on Facebook.

679
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,880
You can like us at Orange Lounge Radio.

680
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,520
Just search for that and we should come right up.

681
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,340
We always want more fans on Facebook.

682
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,880
It helps us spread the word about our show because we don't have big budgets of advertising

683
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,360
dollars or any of that good stuff.

684
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,520
All right, let's talk about the news this week.

685
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Believe it or not, there was still quite a bit of news going on even though it was a

686
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
holiday week.

687
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,800
So let's get into it.

688
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Loki.

689
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
There was some news, yes.

690
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,760
Not a lot of huge stuff, but interesting things.

691
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,040
Mainly just news about Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which we don't really need the cover

692
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,400
because Black Friday's already passed and Cyber Monday, well, why even bother?

693
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,100
Because by the time you hear this, it'll probably be too late anyways.

694
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,500
We haven't reported on PSP firmware updates in a while, probably because a lot of people

695
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,080
have kind of written off the PSP.

696
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:41,880
But anyways, there is a firmware update, 6.35, and it adds Curiosity, which I guess is a

697
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:50,000
new music streaming service called Music Unlimited, which I guess is powered by Curiosity, and

698
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,120
that's something that was announced back in September.

699
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,960
And then of course, also in Japan, they're getting something called XRadar, which looks

700
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,280
like some sort of GPS mapping software or something like that.

701
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
This has been around in Japan for a long time, right?

702
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,760
It seems like during Japanese releases, I'm always talking about some type of navigational

703
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,360
thing that's coming out on the PSP over there.

704
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,520
I feel like this is something that's been in there a while, or maybe it's like a newer

705
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
technology, I don't know.

706
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:22,680
Well, they've had a GPS add-on for a long time, and I want to say that I believe all

707
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,480
the other regions have support for it, but they've just never sold it over here, which

708
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,600
is too bad because that'd be pretty awesome to have GPS on, you know, a PSP might make

709
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:39,040
it kind of worth it, but at this point I think they've just given up on it.

710
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,440
And I'm also assuming that there's some sort of fixes for, you know, software hacks and

711
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,960
stuff like that in there, because that's always something that, you know, they kind of do.

712
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,840
But that is available, I believe now.

713
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
So neat.

714
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:02,800
It's kind of late, if you ask me, though, to add a music service to the PSP, considering,

715
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,640
I mean, it's almost at the end of its life cycle.

716
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,520
Or are you saying that just because we've had all this talk about PSP2 news lately?

717
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,600
It's gonna be announced next year, I mean, come on.

718
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,720
Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's coming out next year.

719
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,000
Oh, it's coming out, I bet you, by holiday next year.

720
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,080
Okay, well that's still one year away from today.

721
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,340
That's still at the end of its life cycle, I mean, what big games have they announced

722
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,440
for the PSP that haven't come out yet?

723
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Well, they're kind of still being powered by some of the big titles that came out, like

724
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,800
that Kingdom Hearts game is pretty beautiful, if you kind of see it.

725
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Yeah, but I mean, come on, like, the only things that they had come out in November

726
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,640
that were worthwhile, I guess, the new God of War game, Ghost of Sparta, which, I mean,

727
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:50,360
come on, it's, how many prequel games to the God of War series do we really need, I mean?

728
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,880
And then they did have another Ghost Recon game come out on the PSP, but there's not

729
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,920
a lot of other things that are available for the PSP that are kind of worthwhile.

730
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,040
It's really slowing down.

731
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,520
So I don't, I don't really know, I'm just assuming it's gonna be kind of going away

732
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,000
at some point very soon.

733
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,640
Breakman in our chatroom at chat.orangetoloungeradio.com, as we tape live on this Sunday evening, asks,

734
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,400
I thought they were gonna heavily market the PSP this year, didn't they get a kid to be

735
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
the face of the PSP?

736
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,880
I haven't seen a PSP commercial in a long time.

737
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,920
Yeah, thank God, because he's so fucking annoying.

738
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,320
Well, is that maybe because their big focus this year has been on the move, that they

739
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,960
really want to sell the PlayStation Move?

740
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,520
They are really trying to focus on marketing the PSP, but the stuff that they're focusing

741
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,780
on, it's just like catalog titles and, you know, just, you know, what small releases

742
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,780
that they have coming out.

743
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,740
I mean, what, or I shouldn't say small, what few releases they have coming out, I mean,

744
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,400
their big marketing campaign is, hey look, we got these old games that are $10 now.

745
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,880
I mean, that's great, I guess, you know, these games that have been out for a long time.

746
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,400
I mean, really, do we need to be marketing ModNation erasers still?

747
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,760
I mean, that game came out six months ago.

748
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,600
AkumaJP in our chatroom says Monster Hunter 3rd is big here, he lives over in Japan, so.

749
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,760
Well that's in Japan, yeah, Monster Hunter does okay over here, I think, but I'm sure

750
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,020
that's gonna be coming out probably next year at some point, but it just, it's not a big,

751
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,520
as big of a deal here as it is in Japan.

752
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,520
I mean, Monster Hunter tried it alright on the Wii, but there's just not a lot of stuff.

753
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,080
It's just, you know, it's a handful of titles that are coming out each year for the PSP,

754
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,920
and that's really sad compared to what's coming out in the DS.

755
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,200
Granted, the DS also gets a lot of crap that comes out for it, but, I mean, even these

756
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,080
companies that put out crap aren't even spending their time on the PSP.

757
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:48,800
I mean, if you have the shovelware makers avoiding your platform, that's bad.

758
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,840
DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom says, I'm still wondering when Kingdom Hearts 3 itself

759
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
will come out.

760
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,880
I believe a lot of that is tied to Final Fantasy XIII Versus.

761
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,120
If I remember right, it's the same team that usually does the Kingdom Hearts games.

762
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,360
Part of the reason Kingdom Hearts 3 has been so unheard of is because Kingdom Hearts, or

763
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm sorry, Final Fantasy XIII Versus has taken so long.

764
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,760
Next Kingdom Hearts game is also gonna be on DS, recoded, so.

765
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,680
Well then there's the 3DS title too they've got in the works, right?

766
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,080
Yes, there is a 3DS title in the works as well.

767
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:26,600
I mean, once the 3DS comes out, I think it's just gonna be the final blow for the PSP.

768
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,480
Until they announce the PSP 2, then that might pick things up, but as far as the original

769
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
PSP...

770
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,600
Especially with these rumors that it might be the phone as well, is gonna, I think, invigorate

771
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
a little bit.

772
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
I think it's gonna be something separate.

773
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,480
I don't think it's gonna be a phone integrated into it.

774
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,280
I can see it's something like the iPod Touch or something where it has many of the features

775
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,160
of the phone minus the phone, you know, like the whole marketplace and stuff.

776
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,040
They're probably gonna try to emulate a lot of that stuff, but I don't know.

777
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,840
I guess if you have a PSP, you know, neat that they have another update, which will

778
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,280
probably be cracked in a few days anyways.

779
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,920
But I mean, there's not a lot of titles on the horizon for you guys, unfortunately.

780
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,240
But hey, just wait, don't be tempted by some of these Black Friday sales, which I did see

781
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,800
they had one as a PSP Go for $150 and it came with three games, including like Little Big

782
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,240
Planet and stuff like that.

783
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,880
So that's kind of cool.

784
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,440
But once again, they're just trying to sucker you in so they can clear out inventory.

785
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,760
And really, do you want a PSP Go when it's at the end of its life cycle?

786
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,560
See here's the thing, the solar flare in our chatroom says, I never regret getting my PSP.

787
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,340
And I still think if you don't have a PSP after all this time still, I still think there's

788
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,680
a great back catalog of games that are getting cheaper by the day, as the console is nearing

789
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
the end of its life cycle.

790
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,880
I think it's definitely worth looking to go get.

791
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,660
And let's not forget, I've always said, and I think you guys agree, that the PSP's biggest

792
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,640
strength is not necessarily its games library, although that's gotten a lot better, but the

793
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:02,520
fact that the PSP also plays MP3s, does the movies, does the internets, does...

794
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,320
That's the problem though with the PSP though, is all that stuff, even nowadays with the

795
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,080
new technology that's out there, with the new smartphones and everything, it's getting

796
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
really weak.

797
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,680
That's a weak argument now, because before it was like, hey, yeah, I can browse the web,

798
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,720
and yeah, the web browser's kind of crappy, it doesn't support a lot of things, you know.

799
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,280
But now, I mean, a lot of the smartphones and stuff that are coming out, that comparison's

800
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,680
no longer really valid, because everything plays MP3s now.

801
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,900
Everything watches movies.

802
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,900
Everything can...

803
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,840
If you're a gamer, you can't look at the iPhone games and take any of them seriously.

804
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:45,520
99% of them suck, especially the ones that are like bad, bad, bad ports of real games.

805
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,600
That's true, but also 99% of them are under $20.

806
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,480
Hold on, I think Jamie wanted to jump in here.

807
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,960
No, I was just gonna say, I've been enjoying Final Fantasy II and VI and a lot of games

808
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
on there.

809
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,480
But I still think Final Fantasy II is better on the PSP.

810
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Yes, because it has buttons.

811
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Yes.

812
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Yes, exactly.

813
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Exactly.

814
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
Their argument, you know, does stand...

815
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
But I get it.

816
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
You're right.

817
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
The price is huge, too.

818
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
It's kind of cool, though.

819
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,360
One of the things, actually, I forgot to mention that I did this week, as far as my game stuff,

820
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,600
because I do have a jailbroken iPod, I downloaded an NES emulator on it, which is kind of neat.

821
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,540
But what's neat about it is you can actually, it has support for, via Bluetooth, to sync

822
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:29,400
a Wii remote to it, to use the Wii remote to play the NES games on.

823
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,280
Just totally random tangent question.

824
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,440
I want to ask Marissa so she doesn't feel left out here, because the Wii is supposed

825
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,280
to be that system that gets everybody, no matter if you're a gamer or not, it's supposed

826
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
to reach out to everybody.

827
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,800
Have you ever played the Wii?

828
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Oh, yeah.

829
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,680
Yeah, my dad has the Wii, and he likes my boyfriend to come over to play Mario with

830
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,320
him so he can finally progress in levels.

831
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,800
Now, your boyfriend doesn't try to get you to play Wii Fit while he sits behind you with

832
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
a camera, right?

833
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
No, but it was...

834
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Okay, just checking.

835
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,600
It was funny.

836
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,320
My dad thought that yoga was for wussies.

837
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
The yoga Wii Fit is hard?

838
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Oh, wait, we're on the internet.

839
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,840
My dad, he thought yoga was for pussies until he tried the Wii Fit yoga.

840
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,720
Oh, you can say naughty language on the show.

841
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Oh, yes.

842
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
The internet is for porn, so we're not...

843
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
That's right.

844
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,520
No, I've played the Wii, but I think the interesting thing is that so many games have come out

845
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,680
now that's not just the emphasis on the shtick of using the motion control anymore.

846
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,200
Which is what a lot of us wanted in the very beginning, actually.

847
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,840
Okay, yay, we get it, there's motion control, now don't go overboard with it.

848
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
No, don't.

849
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Stop, stop, you're getting too close to the edge.

850
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Stop!

851
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,320
Hey, you know, it's better than the...

852
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,880
At least the controller's better than the Gamecock, so the PS...

853
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,840
You know there was actually a game company called Gamecock?

854
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,680
I don't even know if they're still around.

855
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
I think I heard something about them shutting down.

856
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
They're terrible.

857
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Didn't they do the Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game?

858
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,160
That was like their big thing?

859
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
Yeah.

860
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,240
Anyhow, moving on.

861
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,280
Let's talk about some other gaming news that doesn't have to do with the PSP.

862
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Let's talk about the Kinect.

863
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,880
We were talking about Japanese and the way things were received in Japan a minute ago.

864
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,600
How about the Kinect launch in Japan?

865
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:08,800
Well, in Japan, Microsoft's new Kinect sold 26,000 units during the launch weekend of

866
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,200
November 20th.

867
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,600
That includes both standalone and 360-bundle Kinects.

868
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,060
Now here's something to keep in mind, it sold a million of them, I believe, in the rest

869
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,060
of the world.

870
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,360
And it sold 26,000 in Japan.

871
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,500
Now there's a few ways you can kind of break down these numbers.

872
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,080
There's a lot of people that want to jump in there and go, oh, well these numbers mean

873
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,940
the Kinect is a total hardcore failure in Japan.

874
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,320
But then there's another group that goes, well, it's not like the 360 was selling a

875
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:41,240
bunch in Japan anyway, so the fact that it sold 26,000 is actually pretty good, considering

876
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,900
the user base that exists compared to the rest of the world.

877
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,000
So there's a million ways you can kind of slice it, but regardless, that's what it is.

878
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,360
What I also thought was very interesting, especially to a lot of the audience of this

879
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,200
show, guess what the highest-selling launch title was in Japan?

880
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,080
It was Dance Masters, was the highest-selling launch title in Japan, 6,000 copies of Dance

881
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
Masters.

882
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
That sounds surprising.

883
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
They like their Para Para.

884
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,480
Well, keep in mind, they also don't have Dance Central, because Dance Central was a very

885
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:13,460
kind of American type of game, especially when it comes to the licenses.

886
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:19,080
Being that Dance Masters relied pretty much completely on Konami originals and Avex songs

887
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,400
that I'm sure were dirt cheap to license here in the US, you pretty much have the same game

888
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,280
overseas that you have here.

889
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,320
So very interesting, the way that worked out.

890
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:35,300
But that almost sounds to me like I'm not so sure the Kinect in Japan has that must-have

891
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,300
title.

892
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:42,300
I mean, not to slam on Dance Masters, but I think that a game like Dance Central, maybe

893
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:47,240
localized with J-pop hits and songs that are big in Japan, might do well.

894
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,040
I mean, heck, probably even a lot of the songs that are in it already, I know there's a lot

895
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,680
of the kind of cross-culture going on there, probably would do a lot better.

896
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,120
So I don't know, I'm kind of interested.

897
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Does anybody kind of read into those numbers at all?

898
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,080
What do you guys think about those numbers?

899
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,200
Is that a good launch, or is that a shitty launch?

900
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,480
Well, they just have a really small install base in Japan, so I'm not surprised that the

901
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:17,000
numbers are a lot smaller than we have over here in the North American regions.

902
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,720
Let's say that's not bad, considering.

903
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
So we'll see.

904
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,160
I mean, it's so interesting now, kind of where we're at in this generation, where the PlayStation

905
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,560
is such the bigger deal over in Japan, I'd be more curious, and I haven't seen these

906
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,020
numbers yet, as to how the move is doing over there compared to here, because I bet it's

907
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,020
doing better.

908
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:39,080
It is doing way better than that, because there's more of an installed base.

909
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Right.

910
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,880
But is it doing better there than it is here, comparatively?

911
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,880
I don't think so.

912
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
Hmm.

913
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,040
I'd be curious.

914
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,360
Anyway, that's all I really had, Kinect launched in Japan, and we'll see what games come out

915
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,080
over there, and what all gets localized for Japan, or vice versa, perhaps.

916
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,360
I just actually found something really sad just now.

917
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
What's that?

918
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,360
Leslie Nielsen died.

919
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
Oh no!

920
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
The guy from Airplane?

921
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
The Naked Gun?

922
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,360
Yeah.

923
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,360
No!

924
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,360
He was getting really old, I mean.

925
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,360
Yeah, but I just happened to look and- That's horrible.

926
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Sad.

927
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
That's a bummer.

928
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
Yeah, he was funny.

929
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,560
Way to bring down the show.

930
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,120
How about some happy news?

931
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,160
Let's talk about Marisa's boobs some more, that'll cheer me up.

932
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,920
So Marisa- No, I'm kidding.

933
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,280
I can see your dirty pillows.

934
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,240
Actually, my gamer news is that Eidos needs to- well, Eidos is dead now.

935
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,600
I'm still waiting for Thief 4 for the rest of Eternity, and it looks like they're implying

936
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,280
that they're gonna get rid of Garrett and make it a girl, and I'm pissed.

937
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,600
Well, Eidos kinda got sucked into Square Enix, because like, you know, Tomb Raider is still

938
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,360
getting cranked out, but it's now by Square Enix.

939
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:48,400
And actually, the last arcade game they did anyway was really good, so, you know, there's

940
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
always hope.

941
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,400
You know, cross those fingers.

942
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
How about something happy?

943
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,120
How about something happy?

944
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,720
Well, BBC America is having programming available on PlayStation Network.

945
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,880
There will be the first episode of the US version of Top Gear, which is normally $1.99

946
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:13,320
SD or $2.99 HD, and that's gonna be up there for the first two weeks for free, and Dan

947
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,600
said it was actually really good.

948
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,520
He's a big Top Gear fan, so he said it was really up there.

949
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,720
It gets the Dan stamp of approval.

950
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,280
It gets the Dan stamp of approval.

951
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,280
Very nice.

952
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:29,720
Also, Doctor Who and Being Human will be up there on the launch list, and I'm sure everyone's

953
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,400
heard me go off about Doctor Who, about how awesome it is, but Being Human is a really,

954
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
really cool show.

955
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:42,520
It sounds kind of cheesy about a werewolf and his vampire friend moving into a flat

956
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,560
that happens to be haunted by this girl that was killed there.

957
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,640
So yeah, a werewolf, a ghost, and a vampire live together.

958
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,360
Walk into a bar?

959
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,360
No.

960
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,360
Oh.

961
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,480
But actually, it's a really good drama.

962
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,480
I actually really like it, so it's one I recommend to people to watch, but they're gonna be adding

963
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,520
more BBC shows on there.

964
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,520
I'm hoping to see Primeval show up.

965
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,280
That's another good show.

966
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,200
So that's really cool.

967
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,240
That makes me happy.

968
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,440
That means that I actually have a reason to use my PlayStation Store since I don't have

969
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,680
cable.

970
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,680
Just cable internets.

971
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,280
Then again, I also have the internet.

972
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
Shh.

973
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,840
We're not supposed to be encouraging that here on this program.

974
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,240
What are you talking about?

975
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,440
Just watch streaming BBC TV.

976
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
There you go.

977
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,200
So the chat room is kind of reacting to the whole news about Leslie Nielsen.

978
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,680
He's 84 years old.

979
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,160
I didn't realize he was that old.

980
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,440
He was old.

981
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,720
He was at least 60 when those Naked Gun movies came out in the 90s.

982
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,600
But he didn't age ever.

983
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,080
He's on our chat room, says, Happy news.

984
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,640
Leslie Nielsen is now a zombie, and there's a new Naked Gun in the works.

985
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,640
So there you go.

986
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,640
Oh, that's...

987
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,960
It'll probably be funnier than the last one.

988
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,200
The last one was awesome.

989
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,840
Last one had OJ Simpson in upset.

990
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,120
They all had OJ Simpson.

991
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,640
He was funny back then.

992
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,080
The last movie he did was...

993
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,360
I don't even remember what the hell it was called, but it ended up where he was some

994
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:15,640
sort of detective on the moon or something like that, and there was some weird shit.

995
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,780
The only movie that I think he's done that I really didn't care for was Dracula Dead

996
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,120
and Loving It, which is also sad because it was a Mel Brooks movie, too, and it wasn't

997
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,120
all that good.

998
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,120
Sadness.

999
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,380
I can't say that there was a movie that he did that I did not like.

1000
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:36,080
I'd say maybe Mr. Magoo, but I never watched that, but I don't really care for Mr. Magoo.

1001
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,120
They said he was being treated for pneumonia.

1002
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,120
Aww.

1003
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,880
Damn you, pneumonia!

1004
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,880
Damn you!

1005
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,560
Can you believe that Zsa Zsa Gabor outlived him?

1006
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,560
Like, damn it!

1007
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Really?

1008
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
Take her instead!

1009
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,920
No, I mean, she's had one foot in for, like, how many months now?

1010
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,920
I mean, not to sound horrible and crass, but, like, there's all these, like, pictures of

1011
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,680
her on the internets, like, just not looking good at all.

1012
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,400
Pneumonia, you know you have a target now.

1013
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,760
Take out Zsa Zsa.

1014
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
Stop.

1015
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Stop.

1016
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,920
You don't encourage that sort of thing to happen to old ladies.

1017
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,920
It's Zsa Zsa Gabor!

1018
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,320
Come on!

1019
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
Seriously.

1020
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
Wow.

1021
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Alright.

1022
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
Let's move on, please.

1023
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Next.

1024
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
Video games, hello, video games.

1025
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,840
I mean, she's like the Paris Hilton of a long time ago.

1026
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Completely pointless.

1027
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,400
Married nine times.

1028
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,880
Kinect support is coming to the XNA in the future.

1029
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,720
Apparently, developers will be getting the tools to make games supporting the Kinect.

1030
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Just not right now.

1031
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:48,560
They said that they're pleased to see developers tinkering around with, to a degree, the device,

1032
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:55,040
and, of course, they're saying that Microsoft classifies as someone accessing algorithms

1033
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,240
on the side of the Xbox for ill use or someone explaining the Kinect in a cheating manner

1034
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,240
not tolerable.

1035
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,520
Of course, they're saying, you know, creating a driver that might open the USB connection

1036
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,200
or, you know, read C inputs from the sensor, on the other hand, are totally cool with Microsoft.

1037
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,520
They're kind of referring to, you know, some of the homebrew hacks that people have done

1038
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:24,240
on their PC, and they said they have no timetable when Kinect support will come to the XNA,

1039
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,880
but it possibly will, so.

1040
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,000
I imagine they will at some point, I mean, they're gonna want people, you know, taking

1041
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,160
advantage of their peripherals.

1042
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,760
That'd be like saying, you know, we're not really gonna give you the algorithms and the

1043
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,840
device drivers to use our controllers, but you can make games.

1044
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,360
You just can't have anything to control them.

1045
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,280
You know, maybe they're afraid that the indie developers are gonna make better games than

1046
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,280
what's out there right now.

1047
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,020
That wouldn't be that difficult.

1048
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,320
When you open it up to the public, there's gonna be all those ideas, you know, and there's

1049
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,760
gonna be somebody that thinks of something that the publishers have been too afraid to

1050
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,680
do and are gonna come up with that must-have game.

1051
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,840
You know what I mean?

1052
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,120
Which reminds me, we actually need to do, we need to do something a little bit out of

1053
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,000
order and out of character here on Orange Laundraido, but I need to go to the Twitters

1054
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,800
real quick.

1055
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,240
I'm actually going to Twitter topics a little bit early in the show.

1056
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,120
I'm not gonna do them all, but there's one particular Twitter that caught my attention

1057
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,480
before the show tonight, and it has to do with XNA and all this stuff.

1058
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,880
So I'm going to the Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and I want to read some tweets from

1059
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Blue Swim.

1060
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,880
Hey, you ready?

1061
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,080
Blue Swim had asked us a question on Twitter.

1062
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:41,880
Have any of you played the Xbox Live indie game, Techno Kitten Adventure?

1063
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:48,680
Kitten plus jetpack plus club music plus rainbows plus pink ponies equals win.

1064
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,920
And he actually sent us a little YouTube here of what the game in motion looks like.

1065
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,440
And of course, that doesn't make for great radio, but just to give you an idea, here's

1066
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,600
what the soundtrack sounds like.

1067
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:13,240
Now, to tell you what's going on in the game, there's a little kitten on a jetpack flying

1068
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:19,560
through different obstacles, and he's dodging these pink unicorns that are flying at him,

1069
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,240
and these UFOs, and falling stars, which are referenced in the song, if you listen to the

1070
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,440
lyrics of the song, and these little boats with color tracks.

1071
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,960
I don't think he actually has to dodge all that.

1072
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,200
I think it's just the blocks that he has to dodge.

1073
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,320
The rest is just background.

1074
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,960
This is kind of like robot unicorn attack, but like 10 times more awesome.

1075
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,640
I like the stars.

1076
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,120
And whenever he crashes into objects, he goes, meow.

1077
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,240
Look at the high scores.

1078
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,240
It's like a bad like, what is it, YTMD or something.

1079
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,360
If you were high, this game would just make you pass out.

1080
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,080
Like seriously, I just don't even know.

1081
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:05,040
So my point is, this is quite possibly the most amazing thing I've ever seen someone

1082
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,360
do on the Xbox 360.

1083
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:12,040
And it's on the Indie, in fact, I've decided we are going to track this guy down and get

1084
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,200
him on the show, whoever made this game, because I need to know more about this right now.

1085
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,240
Right now.

1086
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:25,120
And obviously, the publishers and the big Activisions and EAs of the world are too afraid

1087
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:32,520
of Techno Kitten Adventure and getting their, you know, multi-millions from I'm sure what

1088
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,880
this is going to sell on the Indie marketplace.

1089
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,880
Amazing.

1090
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,880
Techno Kitten Adventure.

1091
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,880
There you go.

1092
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,880
God damn, that was amazing.

1093
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,160
Thank you to Blue Swim for pointing that out.

1094
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,520
I am immediately going home and buying that after the show, just so you know.

1095
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,520
I will too buy that.

1096
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,520
Look at that.

1097
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,520
Look at that.

1098
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,840
You just sold two copies off that game and how hard could that game have possibly been

1099
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,840
to me?

1100
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,120
It was a thing off of X and A for a long time.

1101
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:03,520
But it was an idea that no one else had thought of yet or was too afraid to do.

1102
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't know.

1103
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And I won't.

1104
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,760
That game, that game scared Shermie out of the room.

1105
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,000
Hold on.

1106
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,400
Oh, the chatters are like, what is this link now?

1107
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Send us link.

1108
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Here you go.

1109
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
I'll give you the same link Blue Swim gave me.

1110
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,400
There you go.

1111
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,400
I'll put watch now.

1112
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
All right.

1113
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
There you go.

1114
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
I just put that there.

1115
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,200
Yizam in the chat says, President Jetpack Cat.

1116
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,880
Act F says, we have our new president cat and it has a jetpack.

1117
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,560
Orange Right says, Jetpack Cat.

1118
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,800
Sure.

1119
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,800
We endorse this.

1120
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,440
Jetpack Cat.

1121
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,440
President Cat's cousin.

1122
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,640
In fact, I will make a tweet right now.

1123
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,640
Right now.

1124
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,000
President Cat's cousin, Jetpack Cat.

1125
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,440
You must get this game right now.

1126
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,440
There you go.

1127
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,440
Some, some indie guy is going to be like WTF.

1128
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,440
All right.

1129
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,080
Anyhow, let me get into another story here.

1130
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:58,360
There's a link right there and a chat, Alphana Kananagram did a, you know, cause now you can

1131
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,820
of course set everything up to download.

1132
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,820
Thank you.

1133
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,040
See, you know, what's funny is that like half our listeners are going to buy it tonight

1134
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,640
and then like the guy's going to go in like, wait, how did I sell all these games last

1135
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,640
night?

1136
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,640
All right.

1137
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,760
Put that link on our website, then you can see the refers.

1138
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,040
Going viral kids.

1139
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,040
All right.

1140
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,040
Anyhow.

1141
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,240
Um, moving on to something completely different.

1142
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,880
This is like, like after that last little game, this seems like such shit.

1143
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,120
This is about 3d games.

1144
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,200
Like I don't even care about 3d games anymore.

1145
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,200
If they don't have jet pack kittens who fucking cares.

1146
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,200
But whatever.

1147
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,360
Sony seems to think that 3d is the place to be.

1148
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,760
So um, if you, but, but, but wait, what did you see the box art?

1149
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,840
No, I didn't.

1150
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:51,840
Can you try to describe the box art cause it is a radio show, the box art is of a little

1151
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:59,160
kitten, um, staring up at something that looks really fucking trippy and it's, it's awesome.

1152
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,360
And of course their little, uh, description, it says, uh, navigate a kitten by jet pack

1153
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:09,360
fueled by hopes and dreams through a fantastical world of techno, techno music feature.

1154
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,160
I want him on our show.

1155
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
Who made this game?

1156
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:18,880
I want him on the show next week or her featuring DJ Hicksie, sea of love, uh, Frisco all around

1157
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,880
the world.

1158
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,880
Production's limited.

1159
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,240
Who made this game?

1160
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,240
Bring them to me.

1161
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:33,200
Ol army, find me this person and bring them to mono X mono X is laughing over there.

1162
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,200
She's dying.

1163
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,200
You're right.

1164
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,200
That's awesome.

1165
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,280
That's awesome.

1166
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,400
I'm going to submit this image of the box art to our, uh, image field there.

1167
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,480
So fueled by hopes and dreams.

1168
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,480
Blue swim.

1169
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,640
If this is a friend of yours, I want them on the show now.

1170
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,640
Bring them to me.

1171
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,640
All right.

1172
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,560
Let me bathe him and bring him.

1173
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,560
He is being summoned to our castle.

1174
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,560
All right.

1175
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,560
Uh, anyhow.

1176
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,560
Yeah.

1177
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,560
Sony, 3d, whatever.

1178
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,560
Who cares anymore?

1179
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,400
Anyway, if you're like, Oh gee, I don't want to play the techno kitten game.

1180
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,000
I want to play 3d games on my 3d TV cause I'm rich bitch.

1181
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,400
And I got 3d televisions.

1182
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,000
Well, good news for you.

1183
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,680
Sony is, uh, taking a lot of the games on the PlayStation three and making them 3d 20

1184
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,720
games internally at Sony alone are going to be converted for the 3d TV.

1185
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,080
A quote here from Mick Hawking with Sony computer entertainment, Europe.

1186
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:35,600
Overall we have more than 50 titles currently being converted into 3d and this number is

1187
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,800
growing fast.

1188
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,360
Some of them are massive names.

1189
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,640
That's a really, really good sign that the industry is behind our unique message that

1190
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,200
3d is a key element in the future of home consoles.

1191
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,480
Is it just me or do I kind of read that as, well, you know, the 3ds everybody's got a

1192
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,480
boner about.

1193
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,960
So 3d must be the future.

1194
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,960
Is that kind of, I don't know.

1195
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,960
Maybe that's just what I read.

1196
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,320
And this would be Sony saying this, uh, yeah.

1197
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,280
Mick Hawking was Sony computer entertainment Europe.

1198
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,280
That's odd that they would think that 3d is the future of air attainment because Sony

1199
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,120
makes 3d TVs.

1200
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,120
That's so crazy.

1201
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:13,000
And that they would have 3d Blu-rays that they'd be pushing for their console.

1202
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And uh, yeah, biased much.

1203
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,880
By the way, over 53d games in development overall, 20 of them are just the internals

1204
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,960
there at Sony.

1205
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,000
So a 3d is the wave of the future.

1206
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Everybody.

1207
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
There you go.

1208
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,400
I have officially purchased Techno, I need to make a tweet about that, but I've been

1209
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,400
reading the news.

1210
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,640
So I need DarkSakura to do a news story so I can go to the Twitters.

1211
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:43,040
Well how about something about piece of shit 14, I mean Final Fantasy 14.

1212
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,920
It looks like they're actually going to be doing an update to it.

1213
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:54,840
It's going to be fixing the skill point allocation, UI response time, more accessible user interface.

1214
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,120
There's actually a lot of stuff up on their official website.

1215
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,720
But basically everyone said, it's crap!

1216
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:08,280
So the Square Enix VP of software development, Hiromichi Tanaka said, the development team

1217
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,480
is working really hard to bring it back to the level we plan to have ready for the players.

1218
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,520
Yeah, in fact there's a whole bunch of updates ready for it.

1219
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:24,260
According to the site, and I'm trying to pull all the information up, more tutorials, more

1220
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:29,640
stuff to some of the scenarios, yes no confirmation prompt when you're selecting a path companion,

1221
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:35,440
difficulties have been adjusted, lots of stuff.

1222
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,920
So let me know if it's less crappy people.

1223
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,840
Did they patch in fun?

1224
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,840
Is fun in one of the bullet points?

1225
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,400
There's one that says collecting seashells.

1226
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,840
That sounds kind of stupid.

1227
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,440
Maximum HP has been increased.

1228
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,440
What about kittens with jetpacks?

1229
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,200
Do we have any of those yet?

1230
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,200
Let me see kittens, kittens, kittens, kittens.

1231
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,880
Game idea man, you won't believe this, kittens, jetpacks.

1232
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,560
Nothing about kittens.

1233
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,560
Nothing about kittens, Rob.

1234
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,560
Fail!

1235
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,560
Fail.

1236
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,040
Well, actually though, Final Fantasy does have the Mithra, or whatever they're calling

1237
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,080
them now in Final Fantasy XIV, maybe they changed the name to Mazithra, I don't know.

1238
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,320
But the kitten people, the cat people.

1239
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,840
Isn't Mazithra like a pasta or something like that?

1240
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
It's kind of cheese.

1241
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,040
It's my favorite dish.

1242
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,040
My favorite dish at the Old Spaghetti Factory.

1243
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:34,360
That's right, cheese sauce, oh my god, you were talking about that before the show.

1244
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:40,480
Favorite dish.

1245
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,320
I hope your boyfriend isn't listening because you might get that line when you get home.

1246
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:48,800
Hey, it's time for Mazithra con gusto.

1247
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,800
That's right.

1248
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,560
And he's long hair Chris, so he might have.

1249
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,400
Sorry boys, she's taken.

1250
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:02,760
Anyhow, let's move on, talk about some release dates of other games that are coming out around

1251
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,080
the world and will start off in the US, although things are starting to slow down a little

1252
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,080
bit, right?

1253
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,080
That would be correct.

1254
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,760
Not a lot this week, and thankfully not a lot of crappy games I can talk about.

1255
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:19,240
But there's a few, so we'll talk about Chevrolet Camaro Wild Ride, which I'm sure is awesome,

1256
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,320
that's coming out on the Wii.

1257
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:26,600
Deadliest Catch, Sea of Chaos, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and

1258
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:32,480
you better believe that the Xbox 360 will be supporting the Kinect and the PS3 The Move.

1259
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:39,960
Sniper Elite on the Nintendo Wii, let's see here.

1260
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,040
Game called Nailed, that's supposed to be a pretty awesome ATV off-road racing game

1261
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,400
that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1262
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:59,360
Epic Mickey on the Wii, game called Spell Force 2, Faith in Destiny, that's on PC, and

1263
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:07,400
Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, coming out on DS this week, and that is it.

1264
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,720
Oh, there's still some big titles in there, I thought Epic Mickey had already come out.

1265
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,480
No, it's coming out this week.

1266
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,880
And it looks like Hello Kitty Seasons was delayed another week, that is now coming out

1267
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,880
this week.

1268
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,880
Yippie skippy.

1269
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,960
Alright, let's go over to Japan.

1270
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,680
I'm sorry, real quick, this isn't a game, but the wireless Pro Guitar for the Wii is

1271
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,320
coming out this week.

1272
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,880
Alright, moving on to Japan and the Japanese release dates.

1273
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,600
Things are slowing down a tad over there as well, but there are still some games.

1274
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,400
Battlefield Bad Company 2 gets the Ultimate Edition, that's the Japanese version, not

1275
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,080
an import, that comes out in Japan this week.

1276
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:51,880
December the 2nd, also going on to the PlayStation 3, there's a few games on there.

1277
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,520
There's Battlefield Bad Company there.

1278
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,660
Dante's Inferno gets a price reduction, so does Killzone 2.

1279
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:02,020
Hokuto Musou International comes out this week, as well as Fusa Sarita Shibuya Dei,

1280
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,480
that's a price reduction as well.

1281
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:09,220
A new game called Tales of Graces F, that's from Namco Bandai, comes out this week.

1282
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,600
I'm assuming that is in the Tales of Graces series.

1283
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:18,220
Oh, it was a Wii game originally, and they're saying it's not just a port, it actually expands

1284
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:23,240
the world and adds a whole new epilogue to the game, so neat.

1285
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:29,440
On other platforms, this week in Japan, looking at the Nintendo Wii, trying to see if there's

1286
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,440
anything.

1287
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,440
Just Taiko No Tatsujin, some of our music game fans like that game.

1288
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,480
Mina Da Party comes out this week.

1289
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:42,040
Naruto Shippuden, Gekkoto Ninja Taisen Special comes out this week, and Babysitter Mama is

1290
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,600
a big release this week in Japan.

1291
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:50,240
I saw the babies for that at Kmart.

1292
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,440
They do kind of look like Cooking Mama had a baby.

1293
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,440
Yeah, they do.

1294
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,680
I always thought Cooking Mama's uterus had dried up, like I thought she was older than

1295
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,960
that, but apparently not.

1296
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,560
It does come with a baby that you can actually hold.

1297
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,520
I wonder if they'll start using those for the home ec class, where you're supposed to

1298
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,800
take care of a baby and stuff.

1299
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,160
My little sister did that, and she was the type of girl that laid out all her outfits

1300
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,200
for a week and looked all perfect, and by the end of the week with that crying electronic

1301
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,760
baby, her hair looked like shit, and she was wearing sweatpants every day.

1302
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,760
It was beautiful.

1303
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,720
I'm sorry, but in this screenshot in the game, is she throwing a baby?

1304
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,600
Like what's happening in this picture?

1305
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,640
There's some type of like, throw the wiimote this way.

1306
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:33,540
It's like baby tossing into a hot frying pan or something.

1307
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,960
Is she cooking the baby?

1308
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,760
It's a liver, a nice candy.

1309
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,100
I'm going to put that in our chat room.

1310
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,100
You come up with your own opinions.

1311
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,960
I'm sorry, it looks like she's throwing the baby into a pot.

1312
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,360
You know how to throw the baby.

1313
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,280
What are they teaching the kids over there in Japan?

1314
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:57,080
Alright, in all seriousness, some other games on the Sony PSP this week, Kamen Rider Climax

1315
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:06,520
Heroes OOO, ooh, that's really the name of the game, Kamen Rider Climax Heroes, ooh,

1316
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:13,480
Climax Heroes, ooh, Riders from Cougar to Oz, Cougar, breaks through the boundaries

1317
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:18,560
that separates their series in this game, it's a fighting game, and it's powered up

1318
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:22,880
the men with more skills.

1319
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:28,720
LocoRoco2 gets a price reduction on the PSP, that's it, I'm spent, that's it for releases

1320
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,960
this week in Japan.

1321
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,840
How about UK?

1322
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:38,120
We have a few things, on the 30th, Super Meat Boy for PC, and then on December 1st we have

1323
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:45,600
Dead Nation, on the 3rd we have Ace Combat 11, Skies of Incursion, BlazBlue Continuum

1324
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:51,280
Shift, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition,

1325
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,440
and the Sly Collection.

1326
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,440
That's about it.

1327
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,440
Few biggies.

1328
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,320
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then we're gonna get to the classic game

1329
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,120
of the week, but first, Loki.

1330
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:09,760
By the way, um, I found a way to contact the guy.

1331
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,760
Did you?

1332
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,760
Yes.

1333
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,040
Alright, we'll get to that later.

1334
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,040
We'll talk offline.

1335
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,040
Yes.

1336
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:26,160
Okay, so, uh, fun stuff, um, this is kinda neat, uh, CD Projekt, that's spelled P-R-O-J-E-K-T,

1337
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:33,800
like Jekt, as in Final Fantasy X, um, they're fighting Witcher 2 Piracy with a threat of

1338
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,280
a fine.

1339
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,400
That's right, there's not gonna be any DRM in the actual title, but if they find out

1340
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,080
that you're pirating the game, they're going to hunt you down.

1341
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:52,360
They say, it says, we are signing with legal firms and torrent sneaking companies to hunt

1342
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,080
down gamers who download The Witcher 2 unlawfully.

1343
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:00,880
Such offenders will be sent a letter demanding they pay a fine, the sum of which was left

1344
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:07,000
unspecified, though it sounds they'll be more than the game's suggested retail price, and

1345
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,240
uh, it says, we don't want to be harsh, um, but there's a chance that this might happen

1346
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,920
to some people if they downloaded it legally, or in other words, um, I guess, don't make

1347
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,120
them mad.

1348
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,800
So is this like policing through fear?

1349
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,800
Or what exactly is the deal?

1350
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:27,240
It sounds like it, it's, honestly though, I don't think that they're gonna be able to

1351
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:34,720
follow through with this, you know what I mean, cause that, uh, I don't know.

1352
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:39,840
It seems like an awful lot, I mean, and considering that as soon as this gets pirated, it's gonna

1353
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,560
be all over the place, it's gonna be a little hard to track down every single person that's

1354
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:49,080
downloaded it, so, I say it's more of an empty threat if you ask me.

1355
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,080
They may try, but.

1356
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,740
Or they'll make an example of one, like they did that one chick that was in Wisconsin or

1357
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:58,960
whatever, that, you know, some mom that they took to court over some crappy songs that

1358
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,500
she downloaded and they want to put her through the ringer for like two million dollars or

1359
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,840
whatever it is, you know, crazy.

1360
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:10,520
Well, just, here's what you do, you just don't download it on a torrent site, because they

1361
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:18,560
get you for sharing, and so therefore, you know, you're, you know, I guess, pirating

1362
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,080
stuff or you're sharing it with other people so they can claim a loss that's more than

1363
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,080
the retail copy of the game, but if you download it like a direct download or something like

1364
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:32,320
that, really they're only losing one copy, so, it'd be a harder argument for them.

1365
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,400
And I don't think they can really track you that well.

1366
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,040
And who really gives a crap about The Witcher 2 anyways?

1367
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,580
That's my opinion.

1368
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,880
Did a pic of Marissa's boobs go off on the internet or something, because I just noticed

1369
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,880
the chat.

1370
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,400
I thought that she sent me the picture for the sake of showing the listeners.

1371
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,900
But it was for your private collection.

1372
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,500
It is not the entire boobs, they're- I thought it would be a good promo for the

1373
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,500
afterbirth.

1374
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,500
New album art.

1375
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,680
Hang out for the boobs.

1376
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,200
Drama says, god damn, those are some tig ol' biddies.

1377
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:10,680
They actually look bigger, because of the way I'm posing that photo.

1378
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,000
Just let them believe whatever they want.

1379
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Let them believe whatever they want.

1380
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Don't get rid of their help!

1381
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,800
It does suck when you wake up in the morning and you hit yourself in the face, but...

1382
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,800
You know what, though?

1383
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,880
You know, despite all the fun we're having, sometimes the tig ol' biddies can kind of

1384
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:25,880
be a pain in the ass.

1385
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,000
Like, it's not all fun and games.

1386
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Pain in the ass?

1387
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
More like a pain in the back.

1388
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Exactly.

1389
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Alright.

1390
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Anyhow.

1391
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,080
Do we mention she's a musician as well and you should buy her music if you're gonna,

1392
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,760
like, be all like, uh, boobies?

1393
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,760
Alright, anyhow.

1394
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,880
No, I actually, this is kind of a serious story, and this kind of shit just makes me

1395
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,880
so angry.

1396
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,440
I want to talk about this for a minute, because this is serious, so less titties, more serious.

1397
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:57,560
This is about something going on in Call of Duty's black ops, and I guess, and again,

1398
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,160
these are not usually the type of games I play, but I guess there is a mode where you

1399
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:06,520
can design your own logos and these logos will kind of go on the, like, you know, on

1400
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,400
the uniforms of the people that you are controlling.

1401
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:15,040
Well, of course, give a guy a pen and paper and eventually some asshole on the internet

1402
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,380
is going to take a swastika and put that on their character to make their soldiers look

1403
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,380
like Nazis.

1404
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:24,480
Because apparently, to somebody, that's hilarious.

1405
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:30,600
Well, uh, Steven Toulouse, who is, uh, one of the heads of Xbox Live, doesn't find it

1406
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:36,240
funny at all and says, quote, it's not political correctness, it's fundamental respect.

1407
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,320
If you think the swastika symbol should be reevaluated by societies all over the earth,

1408
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,520
I think that's great.

1409
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,860
Your Xbox Live profile or in-game logo, which doesn't have the context to explain your goal,

1410
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,560
is not the right place to do that.

1411
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,160
And by the way, that doesn't just go for the swastika, it applies to many other symbols

1412
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,040
as well that my team does indeed take action on when we see it.

1413
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,080
So in other words, the point of the story, if you are going to be one of these jackasses

1414
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:04,080
who puts a swastika on your outfit and goes in order, or whatever it is, if it's, uh,

1415
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,880
you know, uh, I hate homos or 9-11 was a lie or I don't know, whatever that stuff is you're

1416
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,400
going to put on there, then, uh, they're, they're going to ban you if it's just like

1417
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,060
overtly offensive, such as this symbol is.

1418
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:21,040
And I totally agree with the guy, like, and there's going to be those people that are

1419
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,280
like, whoa, we're supposed to have the right to free speeches.

1420
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,520
You are on a private network.

1421
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:33,860
And part of the terms of service is don't be a douchebag and I'm sorry, but if you're

1422
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:39,720
putting this logo, you're only doing it to provoke a reaction of some sort.

1423
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,400
You're just trying to be a douchebag.

1424
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,760
There's really no nice way to say it.

1425
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:48,080
You're just trying to cause a little controversy and be a douchebag.

1426
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,920
Can't you just play the fucking game?

1427
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,040
Like seriously, like why do people have to just be dicks?

1428
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,720
You know, draw a penis.

1429
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,500
Penises aren't offensive.

1430
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,160
Draw a cunt if that makes you feel better.

1431
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,360
Draw Marissa's boobies if you want those.

1432
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,320
That's, that's a, that's not offensive at all.

1433
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,320
That'd take up a lot.

1434
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:12,560
I can't believe though in Call of Duty already, they've managed to, uh, uh, black ops, everything

1435
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:18,220
is a, everything is a dick or my boyfriend's icon is humping bunnies and yeah, it's just

1436
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:22,840
ever since, you know, uh, you know, prehistoric times, you see ancient cave paintings of penises

1437
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,440
that just continues to this day.

1438
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,720
There you go.

1439
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:30,960
So you know what, especially in a war game, it's just unappropriate.

1440
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,960
Thank you very much.

1441
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:32,960
He-man stuff.

1442
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:41,760
I, again, Act Deaf in our chat room says, don't be a douchebag should really be there

1443
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,120
textual in the terms of service.

1444
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,080
So you know, you know what I say?

1445
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:53,240
Since I'm not offended by the symbol itself, it's been used in many cultures.

1446
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,880
It's a good luck charm in many of them.

1447
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:02,840
It's on American, um, uh, architecture from before, you know, 1942.

1448
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,960
But when you have it up there in black on a white background with red around it, that's

1449
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,680
saying something and that's offensive.

1450
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,600
Especially in the context of a war game.

1451
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,600
Exactly.

1452
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,240
It's like, you know what you're doing, you know, these, these guys, and I'm sure there's

1453
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:22,720
these guys, what about my freedom of speech and you know, what are, you know, it's just

1454
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:23,720
a symbol.

1455
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,720
You can go on the street and yell whatever you want.

1456
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,720
Yeah.

1457
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,200
You agree to the terms you play by them.

1458
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,200
Exactly.

1459
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:35,240
You know what, if you want to display whatever you want to, then you can do it without, you

1460
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,440
know, their service.

1461
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,220
You don't have to pay for it.

1462
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:43,980
You know, here's the thing, if you are the type of person that just feels this need to

1463
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:49,240
provoke people with the symbol, why don't you stop hiding behind your X-Box and why

1464
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:54,400
don't you go out onto the street and yell, I love Hitler and see what happens to you.

1465
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,400
Yeah.

1466
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,200
Because that's what you're trying to do with that type of symbol basically, but you're,

1467
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,440
you're being a coward and hiding behind your monitor.

1468
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,540
If you feel so strongly about the statement you're trying to make, why don't you go yell

1469
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,640
it in a crowded theater and see what happens to you?

1470
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,300
I just think it's really awful that a failed art student, you know, had to ruin it for

1471
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,000
everybody.

1472
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,920
I just think it's ironic that people that are usually the example, supposed to be the

1473
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,920
example of white supremacy aren't really good examples and people you never want to fuck

1474
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,920
anyway, so.

1475
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,920
Yeah.

1476
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,840
It's just the most, I wasn't thinking that Greg Probst spit, the white race is a superior

1477
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,840
race.

1478
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,840
Yeah.

1479
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,120
It's, it's like most homophobes I meet are usually like, well, I don't like gay guys

1480
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:38,120
cause you know, they all want to put it in my butt and it's like, don't flatter.

1481
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,120
No.

1482
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,120
Flatter yourself.

1483
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,120
Exactly.

1484
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,200
I, you're like not even on the list.

1485
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,560
You're not in the top 20.

1486
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,560
You know what?

1487
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,920
You're not even in the top 9 million actually.

1488
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:56,280
You're, you're, in fact you, there is no list that you're on whatsoever, so just don't flatter

1489
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,280
yourself.

1490
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,280
Exactly.

1491
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:03,640
And you know what, and, and honestly, if, if some, you know, if a guy did happen to

1492
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:08,320
hit on you, I have to say, not interested.

1493
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,120
Well usually that, that'll, saying, well I'm not interested.

1494
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:15,840
If you, you know, you know what it is, you know what I think all of, all of hate comes

1495
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,960
back to?

1496
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,960
Insecurity.

1497
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,560
Don't you think?

1498
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,560
Absolutely.

1499
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,480
And so these people who think, oh well I'm gonna be, I'm gonna bring attention to myself

1500
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:30,720
by, you know, by using something that I know is gonna offend people and I'm gonna do all

1501
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:34,000
the shock value, all it's doing is just making you look like a douche.

1502
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Give me attention!

1503
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,600
Well this is, this is the, what I, what I would like, and I'm sorry for getting a little

1504
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,600
ranty on this.

1505
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,800
No, it's okay.

1506
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,500
I think that, and you know, I have the same opinion towards cussing by the way.

1507
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,160
We needed some good controversy tonight, so.

1508
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:56,520
I think that by bringing, the, the more people make a big deal out of something, you know

1509
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,520
what I mean?

1510
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,840
I mean, about certain things, the more power they're actually giving to it as opposed to

1511
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,800
what should be happening, and that's taking power out of it.

1512
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,120
That's taking the fear out of an object, you know what I mean?

1513
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:16,200
Taking, and I, and I understand that you don't want to ever forget what happened, what brought

1514
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:21,320
these about, but at the same time, you know, you don't want to keep giving people the power

1515
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:26,260
to hurt you with whatever means they want to.

1516
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:33,040
And I think, I, I think it's very good that they're going to, to ban the use on Xbox Live.

1517
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,540
That's good.

1518
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:40,040
But I do at the same time think that that's just also giving a little bit more fuel to,

1519
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,920
and you know, I'm trying to see how to phrase this right, because I, I believe they were

1520
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,920
right.

1521
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,920
I'm 100% behind that.

1522
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,000
I think that's good.

1523
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Thank you for taking the stand.

1524
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,820
I think that's really good.

1525
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:55,020
But at the same time, I think that that's just lighting a little bit more fire to their

1526
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:59,520
butts and starting more controversy by going out and making a big statement about it.

1527
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,700
I just think the band should have been quiet.

1528
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,040
You know, does that make sense?

1529
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,040
No, it does.

1530
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,960
Ban, ban it, but don't go out and do a press statement saying, oh, we're banning it.

1531
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,600
You, here's your cookie.

1532
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,600
Haters gonna hate, man.

1533
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,600
Haters gonna hate.

1534
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,600
That's it.

1535
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,600
Haters gonna hate.

1536
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,600
Haters gonna hate.

1537
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:21,360
So why make a, why make a big deal, why make a big deal out of the haters when you can

1538
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:26,400
just, you know, if they protest it, send them an email, you've been banned for this, this

1539
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,400
and this.

1540
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,400
I will say this.

1541
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:34,640
It wasn't quite a press release, just so you know, the guy who is with Xbox runs a personal

1542
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:40,520
blog and he addressed this issue in his personal blog, which the game blogs picked up because

1543
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,440
he happens to have that position.

1544
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,000
So just, just to be fair, it is not a press release.

1545
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,780
It was his personal blog where I think that's actually kind of neat that he touches on these

1546
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:55,080
touchy subjects in his personal blog where maybe he can't say it in a press release.

1547
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,080
That I'm better with.

1548
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,080
That I'm better with.

1549
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,080
Yeah.

1550
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,040
I mean, but if it had been out like a press release, that's just, you know, it's sort

1551
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:06,080
of like, you know, when a little kid, you tell them they can't do something and they

1552
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,800
want to do it even more because you tell them that they can't do it.

1553
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:16,400
Here's a direct quote from the dude's blog and I love this because it's the TLDR, Too

1554
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,400
Long Didn't Read, at the end.

1555
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,580
If you see offensive symbols in Call of Duty Black Ops, report them using the in-game option

1556
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,380
and they will be taken care of.

1557
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:28,240
If you want to argue that swastikas are actually awesome, go to another forum.

1558
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,760
On Xbox Live, they are not allowed.

1559
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,760
Happy face.

1560
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,760
See, that, that's fine.

1561
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:38,800
It's, I mean, and, and thanks for clarifying that for me, but it's just, but, but I want

1562
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,800
to know, I'm not sure that I'm making the right kind of sense when I'm trying to say

1563
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,800
this.

1564
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,600
Because there's a fine line between doing the right thing, which is, you know, obviously

1565
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,640
he's doing this right thing and bringing undue attention to it.

1566
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,280
I agree with that.

1567
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,280
I agree.

1568
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,560
Because it's just making them think it's all the better to do.

1569
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,000
Oh, it's pushing buttons.

1570
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,960
Let's do it some more.

1571
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,720
I could get into this whole other topic.

1572
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:08,160
You know, obviously, you know, you, you have a lot of passion on a lot of these types of

1573
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,120
issues because your recent conversion to Judaism.

1574
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,360
I have a lot of passion on the homophobia issues and I could get into this whole thing

1575
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:18,880
about the whole, like, I don't agree with trying to like drag people out of the closet,

1576
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,880
but that's for another episode when that's the topic.

1577
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,840
But there's, you know, there's always different perspectives.

1578
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,360
I just think people just need to get over themselves.

1579
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,280
Let's play happy music and do a happy segment.

1580
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,280
Shall we?

1581
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,280
Let's change the mood.

1582
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,280
Let's, let's play happy music.

1583
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,840
It's not as good as the techno king song, but it'll deal.

1584
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,840
All right.

1585
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,200
This is, uh, the classic game of the week.

1586
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:49,360
This is a segment where we like to take a look back on games of the past and dark soccer

1587
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:54,080
is going to find a classic game that she thinks all you kids ought to be playing right now.

1588
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,900
The classic game of the week.

1589
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:56,900
Dark soccer.

1590
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:57,900
What is the classic game of the week?

1591
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,240
The classic game of the week is smash TV.

1592
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,240
Yes.

1593
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,640
We're going to blow shit up this classic game of the week.

1594
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,640
Awesome.

1595
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,640
Skip up a little bit.

1596
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:12,520
Smash TV was made in 1990.

1597
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,200
It was William's game.

1598
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,880
Mark Tramiel was one of the people behind it.

1599
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:20,000
He of course gives Mortal Kombat any big surprise there.

1600
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,640
It was published by Acclaim for the home systems.

1601
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:27,680
And basically it is based off of the other creator was Eugene Jarvis is based off of

1602
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:35,500
his game robotron 2084, so it's got a dual joystick control and it's sort of taking elements

1603
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:40,680
from the running man, um, you know, where basically you're on a violent video game show

1604
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:41,680
or video game.

1605
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,040
You're on a violent game show.

1606
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:49,920
It said in 1999, Ooh, and basically you have to run around and, uh, shoot people who are

1607
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:55,080
trying to kill you and you get power ups and weapons and bonus prizes.

1608
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:59,560
And uh, it has a game show host who has the best lines ever.

1609
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,000
I'd buy that for a dollar.

1610
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,960
Big money, big prizes.

1611
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,080
I love it.

1612
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,080
Exactly.

1613
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:15,800
And, uh, actually, uh, the I'd buy that for a dollar, um, was, uh, from, uh, a comic in

1614
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,800
Robocop.

1615
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,800
Wow.

1616
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,800
Nice.

1617
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:27,120
Um, you have, uh, in fact, one of the enemies is called Mr. Shrapnel who, uh, comes from

1618
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,960
the sides of the walls and, uh, then he explodes.

1619
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,960
Um, however, in the NES version, he's a giant rolling bomb.

1620
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,800
Um, it's very, very difficult and very, very violent.

1621
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:42,120
Um, it's come out on the NES, the SNES as Super Smash TV on the Game Gear, the Genesis

1622
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:46,560
slash Master System slash Mega Drive as Super Smash TV.

1623
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:52,400
Um, you actually can use on the NES, you can use the directional pad on the second controller

1624
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,880
to, uh, control where you're shooting.

1625
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,120
Um, you have to use the multi-tap though to get that done.

1626
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:02,200
It also came out, um, it was produced by Ocean for the ZX Spectrum.

1627
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:10,640
Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, uh, Atari ST, and Commodore Amiga in 1992, and, uh, I actually

1628
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,640
had no idea it was on the Commodore 64, I thought I had every game.

1629
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,040
Oh, Rob failed.

1630
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,040
I know.

1631
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:21,120
Um, it came out in 1999 as part of the Arcade Party Pack that came out on PlayStation, which

1632
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:25,160
is, I do believe, where the clip that I sent you came from.

1633
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:31,760
Um, it was on Midway Arcade Treasures, which is on PC, GameCube, Xbox, PS2, and they will

1634
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,320
save your high scores, ooh.

1635
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:40,960
You can get it on Xbox Live Arcade, um, for the Xbox 360, it's 400 Microsoft points, um,

1636
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,840
but, um, I think that they've actually taken the purchase off.

1637
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:50,360
Um, but yeah, they had, and, um, the creators had said that they were considering a Smash

1638
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,360
TV 2, so that's pretty interesting.

1639
01:21:53,360 --> 01:22:00,000
But in any way, you know, the game's fun, Dan was actually a, I mentioned it on the

1640
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,280
show before, but his buddy Eric was over here, and Eric had never played Smash TV, so Dan's

1641
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,280
like, edumacation!

1642
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:12,960
DJ Dark Knight in our chatroom asks, wasn't the host the final boss?

1643
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,960
I never got that far.

1644
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,960
Like I said-

1645
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:22,400
I remember, your husband has, like, the achievements on Xbox Live for, like, the really uber stuff

1646
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,680
that's like, oh my god, how does he do it?

1647
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,680
Yeah.

1648
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,680
It's a hard game.

1649
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:30,840
Dan's really good at, and he used to play it all the time, from what I remember him

1650
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:31,840
saying.

1651
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,000
And you, can I say something else, just speaking of Dan?

1652
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Sure.

1653
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:41,600
Tomorrow is his birthday, he's gonna be years old, and-

1654
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,000
21, that's good to know.

1655
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
35.

1656
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Okay.

1657
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,840
And I love my sweetie, so I dedicate this classic game of the week to my boy, to my

1658
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,840
Dan Chon.

1659
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,840
I'm just kidding.

1660
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:54,840
Shut up!

1661
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,840
No, that's cute.

1662
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,840
And he's not even here to hear it, the jerk!

1663
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,560
You'll have to play it back for him.

1664
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,560
Hearts.

1665
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,960
There you go.

1666
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,960
Happy birthday, Dan.

1667
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,960
Happy birthday, Dan!

1668
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,960
Hippo birdies.

1669
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:06,960
Hippo birdies?

1670
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,960
Hippo birdies to use.

1671
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,960
Oh, okay.

1672
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:18,080
Alright, that's gonna do it for this part A of Orange Laundry, but we're not done yet.

1673
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,480
Come on back for part B, there's plenty more to come tonight, including the rest of your

1674
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,720
Twitter topics, of which there's quite a few tonight.

1675
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:29,400
A lot of rapid news tonight, some mailbag stuff, get in your emails if you haven't got

1676
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:34,960
them in yet, some news about new Castlevania download content, maybe a game if I have time

1677
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:35,960
to write questions.

1678
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:36,960
Maybe.

1679
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,800
We're running a little bit long tonight, though, so we'll see.

1680
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,320
I kind of want to take a lot of calls if we can, so we might push the game around.

1681
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,320
We'll see.

1682
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,720
We will be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so don't go anywhere,

1683
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:55,480
we'll be right back.

1684
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,920
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has

1685
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:00,920
a voice.

1686
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:04,800
We are taping live on this Sunday evening as we do every week at AllGames.com, 6 o'clock

1687
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,560
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

1688
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:12,120
It is episode number 391 of our show for November the 28th of 2010.

1689
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:20,160
We are joined here tonight with our special guest Marissa, Marissa Congusto with the boosto.

1690
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:24,340
But we do love her and she likes her old school adventure games, you know, she might not be

1691
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,840
much of a hardcore gamer, but she definitely has an appreciation for what King's Quest

1692
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,840
you were saying.

1693
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,640
What's your favorite King's Quest game?

1694
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,640
You know what?

1695
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,640
Say four, say four, say four.

1696
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,640
Because that was my favorite.

1697
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,640
I'm losing track of the numbers even though I just played them the other day.

1698
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,760
The one with the really annoying owl.

1699
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:45,680
I know that sounds like I don't know the game, but I adored that game and you know, ooh,

1700
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,680
Graham.

1701
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,680
That sounds like five.

1702
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:49,680
I think that's five.

1703
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,280
And that's sad that I know that, but I think that might be five.

1704
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:57,080
Yes, sorry I'm having a blonde moment mixing up my numbers, but Space Quest I also loved

1705
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,840
and of course Sam and Max.

1706
01:24:58,840 --> 01:24:59,840
There you go, there you go.

1707
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:06,040
I'm doing a search for King's Quest annoying owl and it was King's Quest V.

1708
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,040
Oh, yes.

1709
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,840
Have you previously played King's Quest V?

1710
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,840
No.

1711
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,720
It's a very goddamn game.

1712
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,240
So you were just a Sierra fangirl basically.

1713
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,240
I really was.

1714
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,060
I loved Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.

1715
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:20,060
And LucasArts.

1716
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:21,060
There's always room for both.

1717
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:24,560
And his desktop adventures, what the fuck.

1718
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,560
Nice.

1719
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:29,160
All right, hey, and the chat room was backing me up there that King's Quest V, it was definitely

1720
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,160
five.

1721
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,120
DDR dollar bill and Salacious Pop backing me up there.

1722
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,120
So.

1723
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,120
The annoying owl.

1724
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,240
Oh, that's right.

1725
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,240
Five was on the NES.

1726
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,600
I forgot there was an NES version of that.

1727
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,360
You're looking at a screenshot from the NES version.

1728
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,360
Yeah.

1729
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,360
I'm going to post it in the chat room.

1730
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,360
Crazy, crazy.

1731
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,360
All right.

1732
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:47,760
Anyhow, we are going to get into some rapid fire news, but first, this is usually the

1733
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,600
part where we plug the spinoff shows.

1734
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,960
If you like Orange Island Radio, do check out some of our spinoff shows and the other

1735
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:53,960
content we work on.

1736
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:57,000
I have a whole podcast about World of Warcraft.

1737
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,360
I didn't even talk about it tonight, but it was a huge week in World of Warcraft.

1738
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,720
We had a jumbo podcast this week.

1739
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,400
It's called Horde House.

1740
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,400
That's how you found it on Twitter.

1741
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,400
Sorry.

1742
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,960
Well, yeah, it's on Twitter, but also iTunes.

1743
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,400
H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E, the best little Horde House in Azeroth.

1744
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,080
Myself and Extra are talking about Warcraft.

1745
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,200
And Dark Saga has a comic book podcast that she hosts with some friends.

1746
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,200
A qua-qua?

1747
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,200
A comic book podcast.

1748
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,200
Cod-past.

1749
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,200
A com-cast.

1750
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:25,200
A comic-ast podcast pod.

1751
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:33,240
It's called Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y, and we record on Sunday in the mornings, and

1752
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,360
we go up on Tuesday.

1753
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:42,600
And we're an excellent little podcast involving me and Mara and Marvel, or Tiara, and Dan

1754
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,440
Shadow, and we talk about comics.

1755
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,640
Today was mostly talking about Star Trek.

1756
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:52,400
One of these days we need to get, like, worlds to collide, and we need to get, like, Tiara,

1757
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,360
Dan, and Extra for all on a show and just see what happens.

1758
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,360
World of Warcraft.

1759
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,360
It'll be fun.

1760
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,360
Oh yeah, we'll just revert to World of Warcraft talk, because they play WoW, huh?

1761
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:05,320
Yeah, meanwhile, I'm the one with Taste that plays Star Trek online.

1762
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,800
We need to get them on courthouse.

1763
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,360
I did make Vice Admiral, by the way.

1764
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,360
Congratulations, whatever that means.

1765
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,160
I can't rank anymore!

1766
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:16,760
I leveled a priest to 24 in, like, three days.

1767
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,760
Good.

1768
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:21,760
I'm now on my Klingon character, who's not actually Klingon.

1769
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,680
Alright, let's get back into some rapid-fire news.

1770
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:28,640
Loki's just like, I don't have a spin-off show, I have a baby.

1771
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:32,260
I don't have time for a spin-off show, nor would I want to- I remember when I tried doing

1772
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:34,600
spin-off shows, it took too much damn time.

1773
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:39,200
Which was the most under-appreciated show we ever did when Orange Lounge Radio was a

1774
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,200
station.

1775
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,360
I actually thought your show, and you had what was called LimeWire?

1776
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,360
LiveWire?

1777
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,360
What was it called?

1778
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,360
LiveWire.

1779
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,360
LiveWire was your mix show.

1780
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,360
You actually took-

1781
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,360
LimeWire was that downloading thing.

1782
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,360
Oh yeah, that's right.

1783
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,360
Whatever.

1784
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,360
I thought maybe- I don't know if it was a play on something.

1785
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,360
So-

1786
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,360
He was named after a soda.

1787
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,360
Shut up.

1788
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,160
You mixed video game music live on air.

1789
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:00,320
You actually had turntables, and maybe, like, nine people listened, because it was on a

1790
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,320
Friday night.

1791
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,320
Eh, whatever.

1792
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,080
It was so under-appreciated, but you did such an awesome job.

1793
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,520
If there's still MP3s of that show floating around, people should try to find them.

1794
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,120
This is a great show.

1795
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,120
I have all of them.

1796
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,120
Alright.

1797
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,960
Uh, yeah, so, rapid fire news.

1798
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,940
Um, the VGA is right around the corner, and of course with the video game awards shows

1799
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:26,200
that are on, um, Spike, they of course show some new trailers for games that haven't been

1800
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,280
announced yet.

1801
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:33,360
And one of those trailers is being teased right now, and of course, no one knows exactly

1802
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,320
what it is, but yeah, we know exactly what it is.

1803
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,320
Um, apparently the game is going to be a new Resident Evil game.

1804
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:45,240
The way we know that is because apparently, a while back, they made a Resident Evil t-shirt

1805
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:50,760
with the exact same silhouettes of the zombies that are featured in the teaser.

1806
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,760
Oopsie.

1807
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,320
So yes, it's a new Resident Evil game.

1808
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,680
Wow, that is recycled artwork, if I've ever seen it before.

1809
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,680
I mean, it's hard to convey on the radio, but, uh, you know-

1810
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:01,680
Yeah, it's like-

1811
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:04,120
Loki's looking at a side-by-side comparison.

1812
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,960
This is also the same zombie just flipped, I mean-

1813
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,320
That or someone just flat out stole from someone else, which would also be hilarious if it

1814
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,680
didn't end up being Resident Evil at this point.

1815
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:18,680
But there's another, uh, another image or whatever that says, you know, stay alert,

1816
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:24,000
stay alive, report symptoms, and it has a biohazard logo on it, so, you know, biohazard

1817
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Resident Evil.

1818
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Yeah.

1819
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
It's not a stretch.

1820
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I mean, come on.

1821
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,680
Sequel to successful game franchise?

1822
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:31,680
Whoa.

1823
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:37,120
Uh, so yeah, I expect a new Resident Evil game to be announced.

1824
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,640
Um, it's kind of fun.

1825
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,960
With the new firmware that came out for, or I should say the new dashboard for the Xbox

1826
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:52,640
360, there was a new, they're calling it the AP 2.5 Protection that was supposed to flag

1827
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:58,500
consoles as being banned, or flag them if you were playing a burnt game or whatever

1828
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,280
on modified drives.

1829
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:07,040
Well, apparently, not what, a couple weeks after the firmware or the new dashboard came

1830
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,280
out, they have already found a way around it.

1831
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,760
And they've actually come over forever.

1832
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:21,520
The custom firmware group has released new firmwares for iXtreme, LT+, for line on and

1833
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,920
BenQ drives for the Xbox 360.

1834
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:30,720
It allows, um, it says defeats current AP 2.5 protection, protects consoles from logging

1835
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:35,840
AP 2.5 violations, full disk stealth, and yada yada yada.

1836
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:42,040
Basically it means that they've found a way past their new, uh, I don't know if it's supposed

1837
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,280
to be undefeatable, but, um, new copy protection.

1838
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:48,640
Didn't take very long, so, interesting.

1839
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:54,160
Um, and then finally, and this is kind of neat, we were talking a little bit about,

1840
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:58,280
I should say, Rob was talking about how he likes Super Meat Boy, and I was asking him

1841
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:03,760
about, um, you know, the internets, uh, teh internets.

1842
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:10,560
Apparently they get regular patches to that game that allow additional levels to be added.

1843
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:16,720
And they've just gotten 20 new levels, and they're calling it the Sewers of Droz.

1844
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:22,080
It's a free pack, features Gish as the only playable character.

1845
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:30,240
And, um, it's, um, I guess, a little bit different than the normal, uh, Super Meat Boy stuff.

1846
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:36,640
As well as they're also going to be, um, including, um, some new DLC chapters, made specifically

1847
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:40,440
for, uh, Commander Video and The Kid.

1848
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:45,680
Uh, those are coming early 2011, along with the Best of User Submitted level pack.

1849
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:49,960
They'll feature, uh, 20 levels created by PC Mac players.

1850
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:56,640
And also, uh, two non-specific, um, or non-character specific DLC packs will arrive via teh internets

1851
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:57,640
in December.

1852
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:04,280
Uh, Meat Boy, a retro chapter, uh, based on the Best of, uh, Meat Boy Flash prototype,

1853
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:09,760
and iMeat Boy, a pack of, uh, remixed levels from the main game, um, made more difficult.

1854
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,680
Yes, that's right, they're taking levels from the game and making them even more difficult

1855
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,680
than they were.

1856
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:18,040
Well, they, they already have the Dark World and the Light World, like, I don't know if

1857
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,040
I talked about this enough.

1858
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,040
It's difficult.

1859
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,040
Darker World or what?

1860
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:25,920
Like, yeah, every level in the game, if you get an A+, meaning you, uh, clear it under

1861
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:30,880
the par time, then there's a Dark World version that's just even meaner.

1862
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,400
Because some of those level, like, the Light World levels, like, some of them are really

1863
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,400
hard.

1864
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:39,000
Like, I almost cried.

1865
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,360
Just ask Salacious Pop, he laughed the whole time.

1866
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,720
Um, and Rob, I guess, uh, teh internets, I'm trying to see how you would access them.

1867
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:50,680
It says, uh, there's a level called teh internets.

1868
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:57,160
It's a world that will and, um, a world that can and will be automatically updated with

1869
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:00,960
free level packs using the title manage storage system.

1870
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,640
I probably just haven't dug around enough in the game.

1871
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:04,640
There's a lot in there.

1872
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:09,440
Yeah, but they have, like, this cool little, like, um, path or whatever that they have

1873
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,640
a bunch of different levels.

1874
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,800
Yeah, most of the, most of the worlds have that, but I don't, it looks like the background's

1875
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:14,800
a little different.

1876
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,640
Some of the warp zones and stuff, too, because some of the warp zone retro stuff is, is the

1877
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,640
hilarious stuff.

1878
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:20,640
Yeah.

1879
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,200
Uh, Dark Toa Gak in our chatroom says, I'm sorry, but Super Meat Boy really sounds like

1880
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,200
a porno.

1881
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,200
Oh, that's what it is?

1882
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,200
Why?

1883
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:31,240
Um, like, it, it, like, it's the worst title and, like, some of the worst, like, cover

1884
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,720
art I've ever seen, but the game is amazing.

1885
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:38,320
You get teh internets, it's actually, you have to obtain 20 bandages.

1886
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,000
Oh, I am really terrible, you guys.

1887
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,080
I have, like, four bandages.

1888
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,000
So I'll work on that.

1889
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
That makes sense.

1890
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Alpha Kananagram is echoing that in the chatroom.

1891
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,080
All right, I'll work on that.

1892
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,400
I'll work on getting 20 bandages.

1893
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,520
Guys, it is a really hard game, okay?

1894
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,160
That's, that's all I'm saying.

1895
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:57,280
All right, if that's all Loki's got, then I'll go to some more, uh, rapid fire news

1896
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:58,280
here.

1897
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:59,280
How about free download content?

1898
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,580
Who likes free stuff?

1899
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,720
You better hurry on this one, though.

1900
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,260
It's only free until Tuesday, November 30th.

1901
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:08,640
Free content for DJ Hero 2 and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.

1902
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:12,040
So if you own either of these games, you might want to go grab this real quick.

1903
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:17,480
Uh, there's a DJ Tiesto-themed three-track pack for DJ Hero 2.

1904
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:20,760
And if you're a fan of My Chemical Romance, you can get some of their music on Warriors

1905
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:21,760
of Rock.

1906
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,240
Uh, now, here's the deal.

1907
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:26,180
You have to get a redemption code for them.

1908
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:29,200
You go to Coca-Cola's code-generating website.

1909
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:36,260
It's at MyCoke.com, and it sounds illegal, uh, slash Guitar Hero, while supplies last.

1910
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,520
But I can't imagine they're out yet.

1911
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:48,040
And if you want just a taste of what the DJ Hero 2 DLC sounds like.

1912
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,600
I think electronic music is ready to go.

1913
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,600
I don't want to hear the guy talking.

1914
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,280
I just wanted to hear some music.

1915
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:53,280
So there you go.

1916
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,240
And the, the DJ, uh, Hero one's a little bit harder to find.

1917
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:06,440
I believe it's, um, MyCokeRewards.com slash Rewards slash DJ-Hero dash, um, I have Tiesto

1918
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,440
spelled wrong.

1919
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,440
Tisto.

1920
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,440
DJ Tisto.

1921
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,440
Tisto.

1922
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:14,040
Um, dash mix dash pack.

1923
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,960
Um, and that should pick it up.

1924
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,360
Otherwise I know there, the, there was a story on the internet.

1925
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,360
You'll find it.

1926
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:24,400
There was a story on Joystick or whatever that had a link, someone made a link to it

1927
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,840
because I could not find it.

1928
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:31,360
I got the actual, you know, the newsletter or nothing new, the PR Newswire or whatever.

1929
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,440
I'm like, okay, where, where the hell's the link to download this?

1930
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:37,120
And I went on My Coke Rewards and there's nothing on there.

1931
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,600
I'm like, well, fuck.

1932
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,680
Uh, Tigerclaw wanted to know what songs for Tiesto, uh, Traffic mixed with Louder Than

1933
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:44,680
Boom.

1934
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:47,600
Uh, the Feel It In My Bones song he did with Tegan and Sarah, which I actually really liked

1935
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,600
that song.

1936
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,600
It's a cool song.

1937
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,020
And Knock You Out featuring Emily Haynes mixed with Young Lions.

1938
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:53,440
Those are the songs in there.

1939
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:58,160
Uh, and for Dark Sakura, who I know likes My Chemical Romance, the free songs are Bulletproof

1940
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:01,880
Heart, Helena, Teenagers, and Welcome to the Black Parade.

1941
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,820
And they will become paid DLC once, uh, that expires.

1942
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:09,560
So even if you don't own the game, just download the, get the code and then that way you have

1943
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,160
it for when you do buy the game.

1944
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:16,600
That actually, those are actually songs that I would really like, cause I mean, I've got,

1945
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:22,040
um, the ones that they did for Rock Band and I wanted more like Helena is such a great

1946
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,040
song.

1947
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,000
It'd be really fun to have.

1948
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,240
Now going onto another news story, this, I, I am so confused by this next story.

1949
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,240
This is just so crazy.

1950
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:32,240
All right.

1951
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,420
Game Room, right?

1952
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:37,120
It was kind of neat when it first came out and then like the games that have been released

1953
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,840
for it had been kind of blue.

1954
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,960
And then, you know, Chrome has been having problems and so we've all just kind of written

1955
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:43,960
off Game Room.

1956
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:44,960
Right?

1957
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,040
Well, did you hear what games came out on Game Room this week?

1958
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:55,160
If you missed it, uh, Game Pack 12 has the arcade version of Blades of Steel, Trick Trap

1959
01:36:55,160 --> 01:37:01,680
1771, Pitfall 2 on the Atari 2600, which by the way is my favorite 2600 game ever made.

1960
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,480
Uh, and the Intellivision's Vectron.

1961
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:09,520
Now some of the Game Room, uh, people that can, you can go in on the PC version and kind

1962
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,400
of see like what games are going to be coming out soon.

1963
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,400
Get this.

1964
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,600
You know what else is in the pack?

1965
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:22,880
Amidaar, Food Fight, Puyen, Sunset Riders from Konami and Dark Sakura, Twinbee is in

1966
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:25,400
this pack, right?

1967
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:29,820
So I'm sitting here going, you're putting this out now?

1968
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:32,900
You waited until now to give us this stuff?

1969
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:36,920
Like when everybody was declaring, ah, Game Rooms, oh, Game Rooms.

1970
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:40,280
You waited until now to whip out Sunset Riders.

1971
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:41,280
Twinbee!

1972
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,320
And, yeah, Twinbee, whatever.

1973
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,320
Twinbee!

1974
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:50,160
Like, I don't even understand the idea behind that or what, that's, oh my gosh.

1975
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:56,880
And Blades of Steel, like the best hockey game ever made, arcade version nonetheless,

1976
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:01,440
which I bet a lot of people haven't even played because we all just remember the NES version.

1977
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:06,200
Yeah, so if you haven't been on Game Room in a while, now you have reason to go check

1978
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,200
it out again.

1979
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:11,040
Like, seriously, surely one of those games made you go, oh, what, what, what?

1980
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,800
And yeah, the pricing is still the same.

1981
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,600
It's what, three dollars on one platform, five on both?

1982
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,160
Crazy.

1983
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:23,640
One more story for you guys about Dance Central download content and some of the stuff that's

1984
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:27,640
available there, and I'm sure, ah, Loki's downloaded them all already and he's getting

1985
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:34,440
into this, ah, Cameo with Word Up, Word Up, and then, ah, Tag Team with Whoop, there it

1986
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,440
is.

1987
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,440
I know Loki's dancing to that one.

1988
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,800
Whoop, I hope he gets to raise the roof in that song.

1989
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,720
You need to play Dance Central, Marissa.

1990
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,280
How long are you in town, Marissa?

1991
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,440
Ah, I have to leave on Tuesday morning.

1992
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,440
Ah, shit.

1993
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,400
If I didn't have this whole work thing tomorrow, I'd be like, I'm bringing Dance Central over,

1994
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,400
we're playing Whoop, there it is.

1995
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,120
Come down for Tron, you can crash on my floor.

1996
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:59,800
Wish I could make it work, we'll see, we'll see.

1997
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,320
You can sleep in the Chris's gamer chair.

1998
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,320
And then, ah, Black Eyed Peas, the one that makes the creepy noises.

1999
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:10,800
Yeah, it makes creepy noises at night when the temperature changes all of a sudden.

2000
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,000
It's Haunted Chair.

2001
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,320
If you actually like the Black Eyed Peas, I've Got a Feeling is coming out, which, what

2002
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:20,360
David Guetta did kind of helped with that track, and he's cool, so I'll give it that.

2003
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,400
There you go, that's your Dance Central DLC.

2004
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,400
Dark Sakura?

2005
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,880
Well, we have some other stuff.

2006
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:37,080
For the consoles, there is, on Capcom's official Japanese language blog, there are screens

2007
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:40,640
of Yun and Yang in their arranged costumes.

2008
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:45,880
So instead of their little kind of streety looking fun outfits, they are dressed as a

2009
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:48,280
chef and a waiter.

2010
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:52,440
And yeah, chef and a waiter.

2011
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:53,440
So that should be cool.

2012
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:58,760
Apparently there's going to be achievements open for both of the characters as well.

2013
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:06,080
And rumors of an evil Ryu, a grain of salt territory, and some other stuff.

2014
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:14,720
Also for those waiting for Otomedias X-cellent, it's not going to be out until, looks like

2015
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:19,720
Spring 2011, not Fall 2010 like they originally said.

2016
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:23,680
So they say it's a delay in production.

2017
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,680
So let's...

2018
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,920
More games getting delayed.

2019
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:27,920
Same story every week.

2020
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:28,920
I hope it's for a good reason.

2021
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,280
I hope it's for a good reason.

2022
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:39,000
And finally, Doctor Who, Mazes of Time, will be out for the iPhone and iPad, actually for

2023
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,840
the holiday season.

2024
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:44,120
I hope that's going to be in the US as well.

2025
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:54,000
But basically, it's being put out by Tag that's done other apps for different Channel 4 shows

2026
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,720
in the UK, Come Dine with Me and Peep Show.

2027
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,720
So maybe that'll be cool.

2028
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:01,720
Alright.

2029
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:06,020
Are we ready to get to some Twitter topics and get to the tweets that people have been

2030
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:07,020
tweeting us all night.

2031
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:08,020
Are we ready?

2032
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:09,020
Yes, let's.

2033
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:12,120
We already know that it's a great Twitter tonight because of the whole jetpack cat thing

2034
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:13,120
that's been going on.

2035
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,120
So I'm very excited about that.

2036
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:16,760
Yes, we did start a new hashtag.

2037
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:17,760
We're hoping you'll catch on.

2038
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:18,760
Alright, anyhow.

2039
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:23,360
For now, going to the Twitter and some of the other tweets we got this week at twitter.com

2040
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,360
slash OLR.

2041
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:31,040
We'll start it off with Fun ET Man wants to know, any of you at OLR play Donkey Kong Country

2042
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,200
Returns or Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom?

2043
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,760
I don't even know if I've heard of that second game.

2044
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,520
Donkey Kong Country Returns, not yet.

2045
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:44,280
The second one's kind of a little bit like that last Guardian game, you have like this

2046
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:50,520
kind of golem character that you're having help you around like a giant monster thing.

2047
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:54,320
Oh, now that I'm looking at it, this looks kind of cool actually.

2048
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,280
Donkey Kong Country Returns looks pretty cool.

2049
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:02,720
Sorry, I'm looking at a little, wow, that's really stylistic.

2050
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,880
Is that on an arcade or is that like an actual retail game?

2051
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:07,040
That's a retail game.

2052
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,540
That looks kind of awesome actually.

2053
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,640
The problem is these games are $60, you know what I mean?

2054
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,640
That game is $40.

2055
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:14,640
Really?

2056
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:15,640
Yes.

2057
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,640
This actually looks kind of awesome.

2058
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:21,760
And if you shopped on Amazon, you could have gotten in for $30.

2059
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,760
Really?

2060
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,320
That looks kind of neat.

2061
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:27,960
Sorry, I know it's like radio and me looking at a trailer is not that exciting, but check

2062
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:28,960
that out.

2063
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:34,400
Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom, M-A-J-I-N and the Forsaken Kingdom.

2064
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,820
Donkey Kong Returns, I'm kind of like, eh.

2065
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:40,880
My Wii is still in a box and this game does not really motivate me to get it out of the

2066
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:41,880
box.

2067
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:42,880
You put your Wii in a box?

2068
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:43,880
Wii in a box.

2069
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:44,880
My Wii in a box.

2070
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:45,880
Step shift.

2071
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:49,680
All right, Spaznator PSN says, if I can get through tonight on the phone, I'll call in

2072
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:52,160
giving a mini review of Voodoo on the PS3.

2073
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,160
What's Voodoo?

2074
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:54,160
V-U-D-U?

2075
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:56,200
It's a movie streaming service.

2076
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,640
Oh, I didn't know that.

2077
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:58,640
Oh, okay.

2078
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:01,160
So it's like a Netflix competitor type thing?

2079
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:04,760
Uh, something like that I guess.

2080
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:08,240
Now here's why I like having a live chat room, because when we're sitting here going, I don't

2081
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:11,300
know the game, I've never played the game, our chatters help fill in the gaps here.

2082
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:14,920
So, uh, Miklotov in our chat room says, Donkey Kong Returns is hard as hell.

2083
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:19,120
And SolarFlare says, Donkey Kong Returns is only fun with a group of friends and booze.

2084
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:22,280
There you go.

2085
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:27,640
Deathwishing says, Rob should dust off his PS3 because Konami's space on home has DDR

2086
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:28,640
in it.

2087
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:29,640
I didn't know.

2088
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:32,840
So they brought DDR to PlayStation Home now I guess?

2089
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:33,840
I'll look at it.

2090
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,520
I haven't played the PS3 in a while, but I'll take a look.

2091
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,480
It's not that I hate the PS3, it's just there haven't been a lot of games on it I've been

2092
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:40,480
wanting to check out.

2093
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,680
Uh, and is 3D Dot Game Heroes worth a buy?

2094
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:44,680
Yes.

2095
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,000
If you like the Zelda games, yes.

2096
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,760
Although this game is a lot harder than the Zelda games.

2097
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:52,920
If you're a video game nerd, which you probably are if you're listening to this show, um,

2098
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:57,160
there's lots of video game nerd references all over the game, uh, and it's very, very

2099
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,160
Zelda-like.

2100
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,160
And you can probably find that stuff on sale.

2101
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:03,340
I mean, it was only $30 originally when it came out, right?

2102
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:06,840
So now you can probably find it for like $15 or $20 and it's absolutely worth it at that

2103
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:07,840
price.

2104
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,200
The only drawback, it's not a very long game once you know what you're doing.

2105
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,480
You'll probably beat it in like six hours.

2106
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,320
So, something to consider.

2107
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,320
I would say if you can find it on sale, absolutely.

2108
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,320
Don't pass it up.

2109
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:22,640
Um, moving on to some other tweets.

2110
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:26,640
Some people are venting that they weren't able to listen to OLR.

2111
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:27,640
Sorry.

2112
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:33,600
Uh, DJ Rama S says, IGN's top 10 worst games of 2010.

2113
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,040
I had a problem with three of the titles.

2114
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:39,680
I'm not even going to look at this and I'm going to tell you, they're probably trying

2115
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,780
to just create controversy to get page hits, period.

2116
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:47,400
They want people to dig this and what have you and just get more page hits.

2117
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:52,920
It's probably not really accurate, but I'm going to look now and see what, what, what

2118
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:53,920
they came up with.

2119
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:58,600
And again, this is a link from DJ Rama S on Twitter, it's IGN's top 10 worst games of

2120
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:59,600
2010.

2121
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,120
And he says he has a problem with three of these titles.

2122
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:07,520
Number 10, Sonic the four, Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the four, Sonic the Hedgehog four episode

2123
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,520
one.

2124
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,680
I can see where that's landing on people's lists.

2125
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,760
It was a bit of a disappointment for a lot of people.

2126
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,760
Number nine, the PlayStation move.

2127
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,880
See, that's not even really a game.

2128
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:21,080
I think that's just there to, it's just controversy.

2129
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,280
Number eight, Lost Planet two.

2130
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:26,580
Number seven, Kane and Lynch two, Dog Days.

2131
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:28,120
Number six, Crackdown two.

2132
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:31,200
Would you say that was one of the 10 worst games of the year, Loki?

2133
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:35,120
It's not the worst game, but it was definitely a disappointment compared to the last one.

2134
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,840
But it's not, I wouldn't say that's the worst game.

2135
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:40,800
That's not even a bad game, really.

2136
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,920
Number five, Microsoft Connect.

2137
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,200
Oh, fuck off.

2138
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,400
It's too early to tell if Connect is...

2139
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,280
They gave it a good review even.

2140
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,920
I, no, that's just, it's for page hits.

2141
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:55,480
This is why you do not read corporate media websites.

2142
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,720
I mean, this is a, ugh.

2143
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:01,840
Anyhow, four, Fable three.

2144
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,880
I've been hearing raves about Fable three.

2145
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:06,760
They gave it good reviews also.

2146
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:09,640
Number three, Medal of Honor.

2147
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,720
Number two, Gran Turismo five.

2148
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:16,360
And number one, Final Fantasy 13.

2149
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,520
Fuck off.

2150
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,520
Fuck off.

2151
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,960
You put 13 on the list and not 14.

2152
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,640
No, why did they put, okay, they put Gran Turismo...

2153
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:26,120
Your opinion is invalid, person that wrote this article.

2154
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:27,120
Fuck off.

2155
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,520
Now, is that even an article, or is that like a blog post on it?

2156
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,520
I don't even know.

2157
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:31,520
I stopped caring.

2158
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,520
It's a piece of poop.

2159
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,520
It's probably, it's just a joke.

2160
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:35,520
Who gives a crap?

2161
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,520
I don't know.

2162
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:37,520
It says slash articles.

2163
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,200
Must it be with their eight, like, podcasts that they have?

2164
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,680
Doesn't say blog, no, it says editor.

2165
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,120
There's some dude that has the editor badge or whatever.

2166
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,120
Great.

2167
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,120
Yeah.

2168
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:48,120
That's awesome.

2169
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:49,120
Yeah.

2170
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:51,280
I'm reading some comments in our chat room.

2171
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,280
IGN equals fail.

2172
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,640
IGN equals we need more hits.

2173
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:57,720
I bet FFX2 is worse than Final Fantasy 13.

2174
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,920
That's what you get for reading IGN.

2175
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:00,920
There you go.

2176
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:01,920
Enough said.

2177
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,360
All right.

2178
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:04,960
Tiger Claw sends us some links.

2179
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:05,960
He sent us a few.

2180
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,320
I don't know which ones to read.

2181
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:10,760
Oh, I like this one, and this didn't make our show roll tonight, and I remember reading

2182
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:11,760
this.

2183
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:17,060
Tiger Claw says this is a link, actor Billy Bob Thornton, speaking of people that need

2184
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:25,680
to fuck off, blames video games for the death of quality in Hollywood.

2185
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:30,320
Here's some lovely quotes from Billy Bob Thornton, because when I want an expert on video games,

2186
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:33,120
I think, I wonder what Billy Bob Thornton thinks.

2187
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:36,560
I even actually have a sticker that says WWBBTD.

2188
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:43,640
I just like the word lovely and Billy Bob Thornton going together.

2189
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:49,200
It says the man who used to wear a vial of blood around his neck.

2190
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:52,920
Why are game blogs even reporting what this asshole has to say?

2191
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,680
Why is he fucking relevant?

2192
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,960
Why are we not talking more about Jetpack Cat?

2193
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,960
Why are we not more talking about her boobs?

2194
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:03,280
They're right here in the studio, and yet I'm talking about some dickhead Billy Bob

2195
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:06,120
Thornton story.

2196
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,560
It's where every gamer has a voice.

2197
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,560
That's the stuff they tweeted.

2198
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:13,280
Next in all games radio, Marissa's tits.

2199
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:16,560
What we need is Jetpack Cat to bounce off your boobies.

2200
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:23,080
The boyfriend every morning comes up to me, he does the cat paw thing on the cleavage,

2201
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:29,000
you know, like when they're adjusting to get into bed.

2202
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,880
Anyway if you care with this asshole, thanks.

2203
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:36,060
They're geared towards the video game playing generation, and these video games, which I'm

2204
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:40,740
on my sum about constantly, these games are people killing for fun, and I think traditionally

2205
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:44,560
in movies there's always been some kind of lesson in the violent movies.

2206
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,980
By the way, his next picture is called Faster, and it stars Dwayne the Rock Johnson as an

2207
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:54,520
ex-convict on a quest for revenge against the people who set him up in which the actor

2208
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,480
plays a flawed cop.

2209
01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:00,360
Oh, and by the way, he goes on a killing spree.

2210
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:04,960
Not the cop, but, you know.

2211
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:05,960
Fuck off.

2212
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:06,960
Alright.

2213
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:16,640
Let's see, what else, do we have any other, Maginomicon, I'm sorry if I'm saying this

2214
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:24,480
incorrectly, Maginomyicon, Maginomicon, sends us this tweet here.

2215
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:28,160
I don't know, the title is kind of catching me here, it's called penalizing users of big

2216
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:31,560
breasts.

2217
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:36,620
I think I'll also penalize players for making female characters with large breasts by applying

2218
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:38,040
common sense to that too.

2219
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:41,280
Oh, this must be from like a role playing blog.

2220
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:45,200
So like if you're going to make a female character with big boobies, just so that she can have

2221
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:51,720
big boobies, this DM wants to have decreased maximum stamina, stamina drains faster, and

2222
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:54,800
you can't wear some sizes of torso armor.

2223
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:58,840
Have you ever found, Marissa, that there's certain torso armor you're unable to wear?

2224
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,800
Because I somehow doubt that.

2225
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,320
I have torso armor.

2226
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,640
Actually, Rob.

2227
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,640
What?

2228
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:12,880
I played D&D once, and our, if we were to, we would actually have to roll for fitting

2229
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:16,680
sometimes for certain armors, depending on different stats.

2230
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,560
I'm serious.

2231
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,520
He would actually say if you're going to be extra, especially for the guys who would play

2232
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:28,160
female characters and would make them that busty, yes I have many a D&D game where guys

2233
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,160
have played women.

2234
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,160
Alright.

2235
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:36,000
Yeah, they were too busty, yeah, they'd actually roll sizes for armor, and then make them get

2236
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,160
a different class.

2237
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:42,600
It was actually, he was very nitpicky, but I've been at real tabletop games where they've

2238
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,600
done that.

2239
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:50,340
You know, way back when I was in high school, I used to play D&D, and everybody was a guy

2240
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:54,160
in the group, so of course I had to play the girl, because it's funny to have, you gotta

2241
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:57,400
have a chick there, but then all the guys are like, well what if we want to hit on you,

2242
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,280
and I'm like, well my character's a lesbian, so don't even bother.

2243
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:06,080
So I played the one lesbian, and she was, I decided to play the very stereotypical man-hating

2244
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:10,400
lesbian because it was high school, you know, we're all stupid ass kids, so it was fun.

2245
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,400
It was a lot of fun.

2246
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,960
I always threatened to kick their ass, and it was good, good times.

2247
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:21,040
I mean, I have boob armor, and the Ute's brassiere's Nazi bras, so, I think I've told my stories

2248
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:22,040
before.

2249
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:23,040
I still love that.

2250
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:26,720
I made her do that for Dan, because Dan hadn't heard it.

2251
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:31,360
By the way, the name is pronounced, and he's in chat, so sorry about that, Majinomicon,

2252
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,360
Majinomicon.

2253
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:36,040
Oh, light Necronomicon, but Majinomicon.

2254
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:37,040
Yes.

2255
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:43,080
Let's see, we've got, other stories from Tigerclaw, I want to read at least one other one of these

2256
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,080
here.

2257
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,960
How about the Kinect being hacked into a Super Mario Brothers emulator controller?

2258
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,480
Yes, somebody has hacked their Kinect.

2259
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:53,600
There's this whole little video here of some dude on YouTube, playing, oh it's that same

2260
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,980
guy I saw in a video last week.

2261
01:51:55,980 --> 01:52:01,720
He hacked his Kinect, and he's actually running to the right and left, and jumping to jump.

2262
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,920
That's actually kind of cool.

2263
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:09,280
When he jumps, Mario jumps, and when he goes to the right side, the character moves right.

2264
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,920
When he goes to the left side, the character moves left.

2265
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,620
Okay, neat.

2266
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:19,040
They're starting to get a little craftier with these Kinect add-ons, so, you go, guy.

2267
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:25,680
His name on YouTube, if you want to look at the video yourself, Yankeyan, Y-A-N-K-E-Y-A-N.

2268
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:27,440
Check that out.

2269
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:34,480
You can see him kind of like doing the Mario Brothers dance, it's a lot of fun there.

2270
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:40,720
One more tweet from Dark Kiskay sends us, is AC Brotherhood amazing but pretty buggy?

2271
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:44,200
I don't see a link with that, but has anyone played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood?

2272
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:45,640
I've heard really good things about it.

2273
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:49,800
A lot of my guildies in WoW are like, can't play WoW right now, I'm playing Assassin's

2274
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,640
Creed, sorry.

2275
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,160
So I sadly have not played the game myself.

2276
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:57,560
Gee, another console game being bugged on release?

2277
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:59,260
What a surprise.

2278
01:52:59,260 --> 01:53:00,260
What a big surprise.

2279
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:05,600
That's going to do it for Twitters this week, Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send

2280
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:07,480
us some tweets for next week.

2281
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:11,720
Meanwhile, back into some gaming news, Loki.

2282
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:14,640
So yeah, there's some other interesting stuff.

2283
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:21,020
This is kind of neat because the game came out so long ago, but apparently now, Axl Rose

2284
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:27,040
is suing Activision over the inclusion of Slash in Guitar Hero 3.

2285
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:33,720
Apparently they're saying that they filed a $20 million lawsuit against the publisher

2286
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:39,840
for associating Guns N' Roses music, specifically Welcome to the Jungle with the former Guns

2287
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:47,280
N' Roses guitarist Slash and his new band Velvet Revolver in 2007's Guitar Hero 3 Legends

2288
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,280
of Rock.

2289
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:52,560
It says, Activision had permission to use Welcome to the Jungle, but according to court

2290
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:59,560
documents obtained by Radar Online, broke its contract with Rose by including imagery

2291
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:05,280
of Slash in the game and offering music by Velvet Revolver as downloadable content.

2292
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:11,460
It says the juxtaposition exploits the prior association between Slash and Guns N' Roses

2293
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:14,400
and promotes Slash and Velvet Revolver.

2294
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:21,760
Their separate interest includes VR tracks as available downloads, all of which was and

2295
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:27,120
is indirectly contrary to the contractual obligations of the defendants.

2296
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:29,800
That was a query in the filing.

2297
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:33,440
And let's see.

2298
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:36,580
How were sales of Chinese Democracy, just out of curiosity?

2299
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:39,680
That album that took what, like 10 years to make?

2300
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:40,680
I have no idea.

2301
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:41,680
That's not commented on.

2302
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,000
Is he being a bitter Betty?

2303
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,400
Because I think Axl Rose is being a bitter Betty.

2304
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:53,880
It says, you know apparently there's a comment, Activision's EVP of Music Affairs, Tim Riley

2305
01:54:53,880 --> 01:55:00,180
is quoted as saying, come on Beta, you can't believe everything you read on the internet

2306
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:08,600
in response to rumors of Slash's inclusion heard by Roses rep Beta Labace, I guess.

2307
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:14,480
Whether Rose's claims of treachery on Activision's part turned out to be true or not, that remains

2308
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,480
to be determined.

2309
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:19,800
Oh, we actually have another comment that's coming in right now over email from Activision,

2310
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:23,920
official comment on this whole piece, quote, fuck you, Rose.

2311
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:24,920
What do you know?

2312
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:25,920
There it is.

2313
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,700
It's more of Axl Rose being an ass.

2314
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:30,000
It's Axl Rose being Axl Rose, actually.

2315
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:36,400
Well, it sounds like here that I, well, I don't know, they said that.

2316
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:40,240
It's just weird, like a lot of these lawsuits, I guess, take a really long time, maybe, I

2317
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:44,320
mean, because they're on what, Guitar Hero, it'd be the equivalent of Guitar Hero like

2318
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:45,320
6?

2319
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:46,320
Yeah, this is about Guitar Hero 3.

2320
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:47,320
Yeah.

2321
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:50,560
Well, I mean, if Slash actually has songwriting credit on that song, I don't know how legitimate

2322
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:55,240
that claim could really be because, you know, he's allowed to be represented as a musician

2323
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,480
unless they want, you know, make it not exist.

2324
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:05,200
Here's the thing, is it's not really saying, you know, it's just, it's just because Slash

2325
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:10,680
is in the game, I understand that people would associate Slash maybe with Guns N' Roses,

2326
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:13,480
but you know, he's kind of moved on now.

2327
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:18,240
I mean, just because there's a Guns N' Roses song in there, and Slash is in there, doesn't

2328
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:25,520
necessarily mean, you know, that, I don't know, I think if Slash is independent at this

2329
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:28,720
point, I don't necessarily associate Slash strictly with Guns N' Roses.

2330
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:33,720
I associate Slash with like that kind of like fro-y, hairy thing he has.

2331
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:37,400
It's not even really like a fro though, it's like a, you know, he just has beautiful hair,

2332
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:40,600
you just want to run your fingers through it even though you know it's a wig.

2333
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:44,560
What exactly is wrong with associating all that stuff anyways?

2334
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:48,040
I mean, what kind of damages were actually caused to Guns N' Roses?

2335
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:53,080
I mean, because I think Guitar Hero 3, you know, arguably was probably a pretty good

2336
01:56:53,080 --> 01:57:00,240
game, I mean, at the time, and, um, you know, I don't think it's really negative for them.

2337
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:03,720
I mean, didn't they have Chinese Democracy as, you know, download content?

2338
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,720
I love this.

2339
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:09,080
As J100Matt says, well, you know what they say, every rose has its thorn up its ass.

2340
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:12,760
Uh, Jiove Dea, Jiove Dea, I love this.

2341
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:15,080
Also, it's a guitar game.

2342
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:18,680
Who is the guitar player in the band?

2343
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:22,000
I mean, that's just what Activision should take to court right there.

2344
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,680
Jiove Dea should be a lawyer.

2345
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:26,240
There you go.

2346
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:28,040
Ah, whatever.

2347
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,960
Whatever, dude.

2348
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:34,680
I also love the comment here from Death Wishing, it was a while ago, but at chat.orangehonestrody.com,

2349
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:37,240
Axl Rose needs money for cocaine and blow.

2350
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:39,680
Yeah, that's what it's come to.

2351
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:44,240
Well, let's move on to something happy, bouncy, fun, and talk about Virtual Console.

2352
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:48,160
I thought for a second there we were going to talk about Jetpack Cat.

2353
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:52,040
No, we kind of talked as much as we can about Jetpack Cat tonight, but we'll talk about

2354
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:57,120
some possible Virtual Console releases coming from Taito, because of some recent trademark

2355
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:01,720
applications, suggesting that some Super Nintendo games are going to make a comeback, including

2356
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:09,640
Darius Twin, Lufia and the Fortress of Doom, and Lufia 2, Rise of the Sinistrols.

2357
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:13,760
Those were all very recent trademarks that were applied for.

2358
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,720
That means that these games could be coming out on Virtual Console very soon, usually

2359
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:20,120
that is what this ends up meaning.

2360
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:24,360
Just so you know, Darius Twin was actually released on the Japan version earlier this

2361
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,360
year.

2362
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:29,680
Lufia, I don't think, has been released just yet, but it looks like it might be.

2363
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:33,400
Well hooray for Virtual Console actually getting some new content, that's got to be exciting

2364
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:34,400
for them, right?

2365
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:35,400
Good games too.

2366
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,400
Uh huh.

2367
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:37,400
So there you go.

2368
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:45,600
Uh, no, not Darius Twin, not Marisa, that's not Darius Twin, just so you know.

2369
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:47,840
Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have?

2370
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:56,640
Well there is some new download content for Castlevania, Harmony of Despair, for 240 points.

2371
01:58:56,640 --> 01:59:04,480
You can use Julius Belmont and Yoko Belnades, who I guess was from one of the older ones

2372
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:08,480
from Castlevania 3, Saifo was it?

2373
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:16,720
Anyway, Julius has the extra long whip that can work as a grappling hook, and Yoko has

2374
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:23,360
magic, which definitely goes back to the old games, so that's pretty cool.

2375
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:28,400
So let's just hope that it improves the game some.

2376
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:30,400
Alright.

2377
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,520
Yes.

2378
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:39,720
This is kind of interesting and totally something I could see on Top Gear, but there was an

2379
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:45,160
article, can a video game make you into an elite race driver?

2380
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:48,080
And apparently the answer is no.

2381
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:50,560
Actually you're wrong, the answer is yes.

2382
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:56,640
Apparently there is an extremely realistic racing simulator called iRacing, no it's not

2383
01:59:56,640 --> 02:00:06,240
for the iPod or iPad, apparently the top driver won $10,000 despite never driving over 100

2384
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:08,020
miles an hour in real life.

2385
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:12,640
Top Gear, they put them into an actual race car to see if the digital skills translate

2386
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:19,760
into a real racing prowess, and apparently he did pretty well.

2387
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:24,480
He clocked in a lap time three seconds off of what an experienced driver would be expected

2388
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:25,480
to deliver.

2389
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:32,640
Of course they say three seconds is an eternity in motorsports, but considering this is his

2390
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:35,460
very first time, it's pretty awesome.

2391
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:41,280
His braking points were spot on, and he seemed firm and precise on the throttle, and in the

2392
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:46,440
fastest corner he's entering 100 miles an hour compared to an experienced driver's 110

2393
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:54,160
miles an hour, a sign of absolute confidence and natural feel for grip as Top Gear wrote.

2394
02:00:54,160 --> 02:01:02,080
And so apparently I guess training on a really, I mean it kind of makes sense, if you're training

2395
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:09,600
on a game that's an extreme simulation of the real thing, it's almost like doing the

2396
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:12,040
real thing, since it's a simulation of that.

2397
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:14,040
But can you change a tire?

2398
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:19,520
That's not a driver's job, okay, that's what your pit crew is for.

2399
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:22,660
It just takes down sexiness points, that's all I'm saying.

2400
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:26,280
My only worry is that, you see, I look at this and go, well hold on though, just because

2401
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:30,440
I play Microsoft Flight Simulator, or whatever they're calling it now, Microsoft Flight,

2402
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:32,440
doesn't mean I can fly a plane.

2403
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:33,640
But we should see if you can.

2404
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:34,640
No we shouldn't.

2405
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:37,120
No, they have simulators for that.

2406
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:40,600
I just, but see, my thought is that, and it was hilarious, it's supposed to work the

2407
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:41,600
other way around.

2408
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:46,160
If I know how to fly a plane, then Microsoft Flight Simulator is supposed to be a way for

2409
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:50,360
me to kind of like, I don't know, I guess practice without practicing, or sort of like

2410
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:52,680
relive that experience from the comfort of my own home.

2411
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:57,120
You're saying that if I'm good at an arcade game, I can't go fight off an alien race?

2412
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:00,120
You know I believe that is what I'm saying, yes, actually.

2413
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:04,600
That's not, I don't want to live in that world.

2414
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:05,600
I think you do, I'm sorry.

2415
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:09,160
I think the problem though would be, I mean, although that actually does sound pretty awesome

2416
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:14,640
is the, you're still lacking the intuitiveness that you get, you know, if you're a good car

2417
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:19,800
driver and you know all its hiccups and you could sense gravity movement within the car

2418
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:23,680
itself and when it needs, you know, something, I mean I know this isn't a regular driving

2419
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:27,920
simulation but still, you know, drivers get an intuition about their own car and all the

2420
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:28,920
moving parts and everything.

2421
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:32,440
Of course with the simulators that I play, I'd need an Uzi and I'd be firing at the back

2422
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:35,960
of their car and destroying their tires, so.

2423
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:40,040
Does the simulator simulate like the G-forces and all that stuff too though?

2424
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:41,040
No, see.

2425
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:44,880
Isn't that a big part of racing, you know, being able to physically handle it?

2426
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:50,160
Well that's the thing, it says even though, you know, he may have the skills to do it,

2427
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:55,920
he's not in physical, perfect physical shape for being a racer but they're saying that

2428
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:56,920
you're young enough.

2429
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:59,520
So what they're saying is by playing the computer games you're still fat.

2430
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:06,000
No, it's not that at all, it's just saying that, you know, you're just not, you haven't

2431
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:11,840
experienced those G-forces and stuff and the physical toll of driving that fast, you know,

2432
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:16,300
you have to compensate for that and if you can't do that with a simulator, then you're

2433
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:18,120
not really ready for the real thing.

2434
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:21,440
For the record though, I mean most 16 year olds drive like they learned on Grand Theft

2435
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,440
Auto anyway, so.

2436
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:24,440
True.

2437
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:29,400
There's some real dipshit drivers out there on the road and I'm always like, how did you

2438
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:30,400
get a license?

2439
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:31,400
Jesus.

2440
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:37,560
Alright, anyhow, how about a story about Tron, yes Tron, we heart Tron, which by the way,

2441
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:44,700
the Tron soundtrack is out around the internets and sexy.

2442
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:50,200
Don't download it expecting a Daft Punk album though, it's, oh my gosh, things are crashing,

2443
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:53,520
it's a movie score and a damn good one I gotta say.

2444
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:57,240
Anyhow, Tron the video game, Tron Evolution, supposedly does have some of the Daft Punk

2445
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:59,320
songs in it, as we talked about last week.

2446
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:03,280
Also Tron Evolution is going to have day one downloadable content.

2447
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:08,260
So the PC, the PS3 and the 360 versions of the game, they will actually include codes

2448
02:04:08,260 --> 02:04:13,200
that will allow you to unlock some additional multiplayer maps and a character skin that

2449
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:15,240
is basically Sam Flynn.

2450
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:20,160
So I guess think of that as your whole encouragement to not buy the game used, some additional

2451
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:25,760
maps and the code and all that, yes, but that's some of the downloadable day one DLC.

2452
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:29,880
So at least they're not charging you to play the game online if it's a used copy, but yeah,

2453
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:33,200
only with the new copy are you going to get some of this extra stuff.

2454
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:38,840
And that's usually the way publishers do it, they don't pull this dick-ass move like EA

2455
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:46,360
or THQ, EA at least will give you a trial, and it's only really with their sports games,

2456
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:51,800
so if you want to play online, most of the sports games you're probably buying new anyways,

2457
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:59,160
but like THQ with their martial arts games and stuff, it's just a dick move, I'm sorry.

2458
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:03,560
Sorry, no trial whatsoever, you have to pay money up front if you don't buy this game

2459
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:04,560
new.

2460
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:10,000
Alright, well we're going to open up the mailbag at mailbag at orangelauntrader.com and dive

2461
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,120
into the email bag, and Dark Soccer is going to go in and pull out some emails and read

2462
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:16,800
them for us.

2463
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,280
Just two.

2464
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:19,440
Just two?

2465
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:22,480
And it says, non-credible rumor.

2466
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:27,880
Just a silly rumor I may or may not have heard, Treyarch may be doing a side project to bring

2467
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:32,520
casual gamers to Star Trek Online, allowing players to establish a Klingon salon.

2468
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:37,760
The first salon to be set up, Modern Warfare.

2469
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:40,080
I'm going to guess this is just a joke, Dark Soccer.

2470
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:42,440
Yes it is, that's what I said, incredible.

2471
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:49,180
And a congratulations to our winner of our Castlevania Symphony of the Night code.

2472
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:52,560
It goes to Mike, and enjoy it.

2473
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,560
You are quite welcome, he says, oh my gosh, thank you so much, I love you guys, heart

2474
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:57,560
smile.

2475
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:59,880
There's probably like a hundred guys named Mike that listen to this show.

2476
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:01,680
Well this, Mike who won.

2477
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:03,600
Okay, Mike who won.

2478
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,600
Mike who won.

2479
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:08,160
That's now your last name, Mike who won.

2480
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:09,160
The winner is you.

2481
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:10,160
That's it?

2482
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:11,160
That's it.

2483
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:13,160
We've had some kind of like, not very full mailbag recently.

2484
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:14,160
Turkey comma.

2485
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:15,160
I guess.

2486
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:16,160
Turkey comma.

2487
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:18,120
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com if you want to send us an email.

2488
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:21,480
You really need to fill her up for next week, like I want part B to be nothing but Dark

2489
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:22,480
Soccer reading emails.

2490
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:23,480
I'll be fine.

2491
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:24,480
Do or die.

2492
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:25,480
Alright.

2493
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:29,480
Well, let's do the FUs of the week then.

2494
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:47,320
All this is bad, here is justice, here is punishment, here is, this is fucked up.

2495
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:51,460
Nephew to money and my lack thereof.

2496
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:56,560
I want my severance check, do you hear me you bastards?

2497
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,080
But they might if you bang a little louder.

2498
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:03,280
But I am glad to be free of that horrid horrid place.

2499
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:04,280
Okay.

2500
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:14,900
I have to say it nephew to the fact that this week is actually a regular week and not a

2501
02:07:14,900 --> 02:07:22,120
short week like last week was, I don't know, I get spoiled by the short weeks, it's awesome.

2502
02:07:22,120 --> 02:07:27,000
But uh, yeah, nephew that, nephew the round table for forgetting to put my order in when

2503
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
I ordered it.

2504
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,960
That's why I call ahead, you know, because if I wanted it not ready I would just go in

2505
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:37,880
and order it, but you know, that's technicality I guess.

2506
02:07:37,880 --> 02:07:40,840
I don't really have a lot to be angsty about right now, things are pretty good all things

2507
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:45,040
considered I'll just say F you to the fact that I had a nice long weekend and it's over.

2508
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:48,160
Oh F you to the fact that I stayed up till four in the morning last night, that really

2509
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:51,800
wasn't smart because like I have to get up at four in the morning on Thursday to catch

2510
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:55,920
a flight to Burbank, so that really wasn't smart of me.

2511
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:56,920
Just saying.

2512
02:07:56,920 --> 02:08:00,080
Marissa, do you have any FUs you want to throw out there?

2513
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:01,080
Maybe you have some angst?

2514
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:04,480
It's my shock, anyone who knows me, but I'm not mad about anything right now.

2515
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:09,040
I guess F you to not being able to stay out here long enough, but I'm having a great time

2516
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:10,040
so thank you.

2517
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:13,880
Well you're on vacation so you know it's hard to give an F you, it's like you know if like

2518
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:18,360
if I'm in Hawaii and I'm full of FUs if it's not about like some bitch stewardess or bad

2519
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:20,880
hotel service like I'm really like kind of a dick.

2520
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:23,480
Oh you know what I do have an F you, I have an F you to the fact that I always have to

2521
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:28,720
fly on screaming baby airlines.

2522
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:29,720
Thank you for flying.

2523
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:30,720
Come fly with us.

2524
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,720
Exactly.

2525
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:36,040
Whatever happens on good old fashioned days you just give your kid a bunch of Benadryl

2526
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,520
before they get on the plane so they sleep through the whole flight.

2527
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:42,280
Well if you're flying, you're flying the same path I do a lot, that's Burbank to Sacramento

2528
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:43,280
right?

2529
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:44,280
So you must be going on Southwest.

2530
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:45,280
Of course.

2531
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:46,760
Southwest is just a greyhound bus with wings.

2532
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:47,760
Exactly.

2533
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:52,800
I love how the stewardess just don't care anymore like do you want peanuts?

2534
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:55,240
You want to have some peanuts?

2535
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:59,800
The thing that pisses me off is that I used to be neurotic about signing on 24 hours in

2536
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:05,840
advance so I could get the A1 boarding pass, but now they got smart and they sell like

2537
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:10,080
one through thirty for an additional ten bucks so I could be the first one on at like you

2538
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:15,960
know 24 hours before and I'll have like B1 to board and like that is soul crushing.

2539
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:21,800
I used to have to do that for my boss, she was always flying Southwest if you're a law

2540
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:26,800
firm and yeah she was completely anal retentive about that though but the funniest thing now

2541
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:30,040
is that, I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but I said maybe like if you're a B

2542
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:34,080
and it's really obvious and now they have the standing in the number order, don't give

2543
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:38,720
a shit, they just take you like you know you don't have to stand at like you could stand

2544
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:41,680
at 16 if you're number 50 they don't care.

2545
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:45,600
Right yeah it's not exact but you definitely have those people that are like oh excuse

2546
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:50,400
me I believe you need to be on this side of the sign because you're holding that number.

2547
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:55,120
You just put your hand over that part just like where you're holding it you know.

2548
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:57,120
I know.

2549
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:00,600
So yeah although I didn't have to get scanner molested which was nice because I was knocking

2550
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:02,320
off for that picture.

2551
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:06,640
I've had the nudie pictures taken I was in a really bad mood the day it was at the Oakland

2552
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:10,640
airport and that was the day that the tires caught on fire like go back a few episodes

2553
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:15,000
is when I was trying to do like a secret trip or whatever we just the whole thing just got

2554
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,320
ruined and I was at the Oakland airport and I had a nudie picture taken it was like that

2555
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:23,680
part of the day where like I just didn't even care anymore and like it wasn't the part that

2556
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:28,280
they were taking the picture to bother me but they were just being such jerks like you

2557
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:32,360
need to put your hands up sir it's like give someone a badge and it just gives them the

2558
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:37,000
right to be a total asshole you know it's like god learn customers as someone who taught

2559
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,120
customer service for nine years a lot of those like security type people really bother me

2560
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:46,120
really bother me yeah they actually at least from my experience they're really nice at

2561
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:50,480
Burbank but I mean you talk about those image scanners I mean there's plenty of images have

2562
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:53,960
already shown up showed up on the internet okay you take a scan of somebody that has

2563
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:58,240
gigantic boobs or a big way or something unusual on your body they don't get paid enough to

2564
02:10:58,240 --> 02:11:03,200

2574
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:53,480

2575
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:57,880
a pose that's what my one of my friends when we were at the airport she got picked for

2576
02:11:57,880 --> 02:12:01,440
around when we went to Boston for PAX East funny enough she got picked for the random

2577
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:05,000
screening because then it was not everybody did it it was just random or I don't know

2578
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,880
if maybe it's still that way now so I didn't have to do it but Amanda had to do it and

2579
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:14,780
she she was excited she's like I get to do the nudie picture so she's like running over

2580
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:17,880
there and she like totally does this pose where she has her hands up and she's like

2581
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:21,400
do this because she's fucking adorable to begin with and then she does this whole like

2582
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:26,160
little like pose thing when she's standing there and I'm just like you are having way

2583
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:29,640
too much fun with the nudie picture taking I like the people that have the idea of doing

2584
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:35,560
the the spinal tap thing and having a cucumber wrapped in a wrap and foil in your pants so

2585
02:12:35,560 --> 02:12:41,140
you know my spinal tap it oh boy when that is that can you bring can you technically

2586
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:45,800
bring a cucumber wrapped in foil well they try they find it in the scanner but you cannot

2587
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:51,640
as they put in the spinal tap that was lunch I needed something to suck on on the plane

2588
02:12:51,640 --> 02:13:00,000
anyhow let's move on hey more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the skype

2591
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:19,160
for you guys yeah this is kind of neat apparently EA Tiburon is rumored to be in early development

2592
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:25,800
for a new NFL blitz because hey Midway sucked it up with that series and Warner didn't do

2593
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:31,960
too much better so now they're gonna give it a new shot since hey you know NBA Jam did

2594
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:38,760
all right and so I don't know NFL blitz could be kind of fun I liked NFL blitz someone played

2595
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:45,480
any NBA Jam yet though this is a new one but they say they probably won't arrive until

2596
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:55,480
2012 so it's rumored for now all right I like rumors I guess NFL blitz is kind of cool so

2597
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:59,680
be interesting if that's coming back as well as NBA Jam did earlier this year I'm sorry

2598
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:04,600
I'm just distracted by a link that was posted in chat by solar flare fig leaf yes it's a

2599
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:10,120
it's like I guess you can buy like panties or boxer briefs or whatever that have a giant

2600
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:15,240
fig leaf on them that are made of some type of radiation proof material so when they scan

2601
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:19,600
you the little fig leaf will come up instead to be for bras too yeah oh you can get you

2602
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:28,640
get the hands for the bras like the barber Streisand dress or I don't know if you've

2603
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:34,240
seen burlesque yet but there's there's definitely a nod to that there's been a hot mess of glitz

2604
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:39,360
and glam I did see burlesque this week the day after Thanksgiving and it was actually

2605
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:45,000
no I saw it on Thanksgiving and it was it was it was very very very gay it was share

2606
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:51,240
the best more complaining that it wasn't hot mess enough that's it's it's for look if you're

2607
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:56,000
gonna go see burlesque and you're gonna go see a movie starring Sharon Christina Aguilera

2608
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,400
you ought to know exactly what you're gonna get and the movie does deliver you you get

2609
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:08,240
exactly that but I'm just saying it's it's it's a movie starring share I mean there's

2610
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:13,380
you know if this is for you or not like there's no surprise here target I would not recommend

2611
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:17,320
Loki go see this unless maybe he wants to check out there are some scantily clad women

2612
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:21,520
but they don't ever deliver on the actual man I know I say where's the real burlesque

2613
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:27,720
with the pasties and yeah no they don't do anything it is kind of like it's it's watered

2614
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:31,560
down burlesque a little bit but I but then but then there's that part of me it's like

2615
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:36,540
but share is a fucking fierce fierce bitch and she steals every scene she's in every

2616
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:42,400
scene share is an extended lady marmalade video yeah that's fair that's fair but with

2617
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:46,440
share and she's made of awesome so and I know I know a lot of the listeners probably want

2618
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:49,440
to hear this but we'll have girl talk here for a minute I will say the guy that plays

2619
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:54,480
Christina Aguilera's love interest in the movie is smoking hot smoking hot he kind of

2620
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:59,840
he reminded me of the previous of a young Cary Elwes but he's aged weird so yes yeah

2621
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:07,840
yeah I saw Cary Elwes in the a preview for Saw 3D and I was like oh wow wow he's back

2622
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:12,860
in that yeah he's he's and then it's good I don't really like to follow the Saw movies

2623
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:17,480
from what I understand they bring him back as part of a flashback people who know people

2624
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:24,760
who've all survived the games from prior but he didn't survive I don't know whatever chat

2625
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:32,480
wants to know was it better or worse than showgirls on a scale of one to showgirl here's

2626
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:38,640
the thing though I love showgirls because it's so bad it's good and it burlesque isn't

2627
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:43,360
really like that I don't think burlesque was bad it was just it was like a movie from the

2628
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:47,840
nineteen forties you know exactly what's going to happen the plot you see coming from a mile

2629
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:53,960
away it's not really any surprises but if you're just going to you know have fun and

2630
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:58,720
just not really think for a couple hours it's good for that I heard people complaining they

2631
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:04,000
want it to be showgirls era hot mess no it's not that much of a gamer topic what about

2632
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:10,360
burlesque the game well I'd like to see that on Xbox connect actually have to actually

2633
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:16,080
they have to shake your titties and you know that somebody's going to come up with something

2634
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:22,240
like because it's sort of connect thing specifically for that oh hey back to video games I do have

2635
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:28,100
one more a actually funny enough this is about the boobs and connect so maybe they could

2636
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:34,320
use this in a burlesque type game but the Xbox 360 is connect it can track the head

2637
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:39,440
it can track the hands but now we can track the breasts that's right this is Dan Wilcox

2638
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:43,920
actually hacked the connect to see if it could spot his chest and what happens is that the

2639
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:51,100
computer is looking for his man boobs and draws a bra or pasties on top and music plays

2640
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:56,920
when titties are detected so sure enough there's this little video called the connect titty

2641
02:17:56,920 --> 02:18:12,440
tracker and the guys moving back and forth and like it draws a little bra on his chest

2642
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:19,280
that's a CBS needs I don't know why it's all skippy I don't know if that's the program

2643
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:31,840
or what that's because the music so there goes I look for a person size blob and use

2644
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:38,640
it centroid to approximate a search box wherein to detect two boobs so I don't know if it

2645
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:43,640
would work on women yet but we haven't seen that video or at least it's not appropriate

2646
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:49,000
to be on family websites I don't know but there you go the connect can now officially

2647
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:59,880
track your movies so you are just giggling away too much rob like a little so much stupid

2648
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:07,200

2658
02:19:51,840 --> 02:20:01,320
boobs uh well that wasn't my intention but sure why not they're always relevant uh what

2659
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:09,360
did you call in to talk about tonight um well as I had mentioned on uh twitter uh and working

2660
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:16,680
new and turning red uh earlier in the show um I was going to talk about uh that new voodoo

2661
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:21,280
service over on uh playstation notebook oh yes tell us a little bit about voodoo because

2662
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:27,400
I'm not very familiar with it what is uh what's up with voodoo um well I started to know it's

2663
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:35,800
a relatively new service it I think it's uh started by either walmart or best buy or one

2664
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:43,480
of those big you know retail chains it's uh basically they're equivalent to uh the playstation

2665
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:52,920
network video store um you know you know you know basically you can uh rent uh or buy movies

2666
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:59,760
uh from their service kind of like what you can do from playstation network uh and plus

2667
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:08,880
it has um you know you know full twitter and facebook integration on that and and not only

2668
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:16,200
that but um you know you know you get you know here's kind of a unusual you know interface

2669
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:24,760
twitter at least unusual compared to say uh uh the xbox uh xbox video marketplace and

2670
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:33,720
compared to uh playstation network where uh now it has uh a multi-page menu to it where

2671
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:39,320
you know it'll give you a whole bunch of information regarding the movie like uh like a platform

2672
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:44,240
oops sorry I'm on the website and it started a video I hate this fucking autoplay shit

2673
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:48,640
sorry I was on the voodoo website trying to educate myself but it started an autoplay

2674
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:57,280
video well basically it has a multi-page uh menu to it where it'll tell you you know all

2675
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:03,120
about the movie who made it who's in it plot summary so on and so forth even though the

2676
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:10,400
box art to uh the the movie if you know you know like what you would see on a dvd or blu-ray

2677
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:17,000
whatever now the only you know there is a uh you know anything interfacing all that

2678
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:23,940
I love the interface you know it's a whole lot better than you know the playstation network

2679
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:32,400
and you know the market sauce service uh and plus you know with their videos you know you

2680
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:37,080
can even get five point you know once around sound on the videos so okay so it has a very

2681
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:44,240
pretty interface does it cost money to use it uh yeah it is basically you know uh you

2682
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:50,680
know you pay actual dollars and cents to rent or you know rent or buy the movie just like

2683
02:22:50,680 --> 02:23:00,240
you would for uh blockbuster video or hollywood video or anywhere else uh you know unlike

2684
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:06,600
where uh you know unlike netflix where you got like you know one flat fee rent everything

2685
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:11,760
now you pay per movie on voodoo all right well you know what I find interesting voodoo

2686
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:16,960
um I'm reading about it they were just recently bought by walmart so it's the walmart movie

2687
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:20,760
company now although they're still called voodoo it's actually owned by walmart so I

2688
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:24,800
hope they don't go in and edit movies like they do cds that get sold in the stores that

2689
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:32,400
would be disappointing uh yeah and the thing is with the voodoo app over on places network

2690
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:37,720
they actually give you the first rental free uh everything else after that you know you

2691
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:41,520
have to pay for so does that mean everybody can go get one free movie just by like signing

2692
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:48,760
up yep no all you gotta do is print like an email address well yeah everybody has an email

2693
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:55,080
address they send all their spam to so that'll work yeah now the there's like a couple minor

2694
02:23:55,080 --> 02:24:01,520
downsides to it um well even now I should wait I gotta say I gotta say hold on this

2695
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:06,840
is very interesting I'm sorry voodoo apparently uh at one point actually would rent adult

2696
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:12,040
titles but on february 25th to comply with the policies of its parents company voodoo

2697
02:24:12,040 --> 02:24:18,440
discontinued operated sorry discontinued operating the avn after dark channel which had the adult

2698
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:25,280
movies on it oh now see I it's a bummer they didn't keep that open because I was I've been

2699
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:29,480
saying this for the longest time whoever brings us the porto first is going to win this video

2700
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:35,800
on demand war so if uh voodoo had done it man nobody would even be talking about hulu

2701
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:44,480
because voodoo has the titties yeah uh there's I you know despite all the things I do like

2702
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:49,240
about the voodoo servers there's a couple things I don't like about and which are kind

2703
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:55,540
of major issues uh first of all you can't like download any videos that you rent or

2704
02:24:55,540 --> 02:25:02,000
buy locally to your hard drive you have to stream it okay uh and combine that with the

2705
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:08,360
fact that you have to be logged into playstation network while you're viewing the movies so

2706
02:25:08,360 --> 02:25:13,640
if god forbid you know for whatever reason your internet goes out or whatever basically

2707
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:24,080
you're s o l uh and not uh not only that but I have um as a side note a really fast internet

2708
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:31,120
connection roughly about 20 megabits per second and even with that and having every other

2709
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:39,760
device turned off like my 360 and psp and so forth when I rented the high you know the

2710
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:46,960
really high quality uh hd uh the expendables with 5.1 surround sound that the movie was

2711
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:54,280
constantly stuttering trying to buffer and whatnot and you know you know that shouldn't

2712
02:25:54,280 --> 02:26:00,280
happen you know because I have a fast internet service and not only that but uh every it

2713
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:09,320
seems like every minute half to two minutes uh you know it literally would stop streaming

2714
02:26:09,320 --> 02:26:15,080
out the gallery saying oh yeah we can't no there's some kind of a problem we you know

2715
02:26:15,080 --> 02:26:19,960
I can't stream this as a movie try back later all right so it sounds like there might still

2716
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:23,840
be some uh network issues I gotta wrap up so we can get more calls but I kind of want

2717
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:28,080
to get the quick bottom line what's like the one sentence bottom line on this is it worth

2718
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:32,000
checking out and getting your free movie or you know what no there's still too many problems

2719
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:38,880
right now if you can you know uh if you're willing to deal with a few uh headaches go

2720
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:46,020
ahead and try it you know there's a free rental but you know I wouldn't actually pay money

2721
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:50,600
out of pocket for it though all right there you have it spazzinator thanks for the review

2722
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:55,600
on voodoo we're gonna uh let you guys get more calls all right have a good one all right

2723
02:26:55,600 --> 02:27:00,320
have a good one later all right it's a bummer he missed out on all the pornography but I

2724
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:06,800
guess I guess that was the pre-playstation 3 era or something idk uh 1877 game olr if

2725
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:10,960
you want to give us a call or our username on skype orange lounge radio all one word

2726
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:16,440
um by the way some kind of like late breaking news here I guess I can go ahead and say this

2727
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:21,160
it's not really a secret uh loki was successfully able to get a hold of the techno kitten adventure

2728
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:26,360
guy so we're gonna um we're gonna see when he's available if he says he's available sundays

2729
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:32,240

2751
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:18,520
confirm that for me when they have it and you do it to earn points it's pretty cool

2752
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:26,480

event you chase the turkeys around and you could get a turkey costume I swear home is

2759
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:04,600
like not even home doesn't even try to hide that it's catering to the furries it really

2760
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:09,600
doesn't try to hide it at all well you know they actually have costumes now that you could

2761

dress up as like a cat or a bulldog or stuff like that you know if you're in the home clubs

2762
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:22,720

2773
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:34,120

2774
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:38,280
I want to get in the costume and go dancing home like this why am I not seeing like a

2782
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:33,720
uh actually if your pants could go on the ground home would probably be a lot more popular

2783
02:32:33,720 --> 02:32:37,760
with a certain crowd midway which is like that one place in the fan of business where

2784
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:42,920
is on the pier whatever that place is you can play like carnival games there and earn

2787
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:56,400

2788
02:32:56,400 --> 02:33:01,400
beta just to say it's gonna grow it's just a constant reminder that they don't owe you

2789
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:06,560
shit that's really the beta tag being on there so long is really just a reminder like we

2790
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:13,360

2834
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:38,800

2835
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:47,520
the whole thing is that will be celebrity thing is uh a bit stupid as one can be expected

2836
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:57,360
but the uh and the vampire thing is kind of like make almost in some way but uh what are

2837
02:37:57,360 --> 02:38:05,200
there well the kind of like good thing is that well we finally have penthouse and such

2838
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:14,240
and apartments which is kind of good in one way if you're having a small sims family so

2839
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:18,120
you can get a penthouse huh all right I'm liking where this is going do you get to get

2840
02:38:18,120 --> 02:38:27,000
a $15 gold suit no you no you can't not yet all right yeah do they do anything else besides

2841
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:34,240
just like items are there new like game modes or new things experience oh um what are there

2842
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:48,040
like uh um new skills no uh oh yeah the new uh like uh music stuff is kind of cool afterwards

2843
02:38:48,040 --> 02:38:55,760
once you get the hang of it even and one and one the annoying part about uh vampires that

2844
02:38:55,760 --> 02:39:02,200
really frustrate frustrates me like hell is that if you have vampire children they can

2845
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:10,680
skill up in their skill that they're doing at the moment like instant really hold on

2846
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:17,920
hold on be it hold on back up rewind press pause you can be a vampire now in the sims

2847
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:27,600
yeah can you sparkle so you can well be all the that series do you get to sparkle is just

2848
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:35,680
like twilight vampires no no it's not exactly like that oh thank god we do they don't sparkle

2849
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:41,920
oh thank god so they're not mormon vampires yeah okay there are vampires but there aren't

2850
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:50,960
aren't any werewolves so it's not the so it's not 100 twilight of sorts well that's that's

2851
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:55,880
a relief thank god so you can you can do more like uh i don't know dark shadows as opposed

2852
02:39:55,880 --> 02:40:04,320
to because like dark shadows cool vampires twilight not cool vampires big difference

2853
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:15,080
barnabas awesome r patinson not awesome anyhow oh yeah but one of the one of the ways kind

2854
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:21,400
of like cool is that the um you have now uh you can actually build like you can build

2855
02:40:21,400 --> 02:40:32,960
your own swimming pool uh within uh on uh like send a few stories up of sorts say this

2856
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:38,880
it seems before you couldn't actually build that build a swimming pool on your second

2857
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:46,460
floor yes i could drown people on my roof and wait can you can you torture the vampires

2858
02:40:46,460 --> 02:40:51,840
by like putting them in sunlight or like you know putting a bunch of garlic in the kitchen

2859
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:58,040
that's really like fun because uh if you because they don't because the vampires here don't

2860
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:06,360
they can't uh be in the twilight be in the uh sun that often but if you do you will get

2861
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:16,880
this oh can't do much and they uh like um oh how do you say though they uh they uh oh

2862
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:24,800
they lose their hands so it's quite it's quite hilarious i haven't killed anyone yet doing

2863
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:30,520
that torturing the sims is the whole reason to play sims you need to get on that yeah

2864
02:41:30,520 --> 02:41:36,740
all right well okay ripper let's let's try to wrap up here is is the sims 3 night time

2865
02:41:36,740 --> 02:41:45,000
expansion a must-have yeah it is there'd be and oh oh and let's not forget there is actually

2866
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:52,360
some nice very very very very nice clothing for your sims do we mean lack of clothing

2867
02:41:52,360 --> 02:42:00,240
or like actual clothing actual clothing in this one because sometimes nice clothing means

2868
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:05,160
like you know all these new bras and panties for your sims to run around in all day long

2869
02:42:05,160 --> 02:42:10,960

2884
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:30,800
our minds yeah one thing um the game um elo milo i guess it's not out yet at least on

2885
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:37,040
xbox live arcade but there is a way you can get to play it and actually be it's a way

2886
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:43,440
of promoting the game virally i guess and it is out um for free on windows phone 7 devices

2887
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:47,980
but on xbox live arcade there is a way to download the demo which if you want to you

2888
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:54,600
can download the full game um before it's released and to do that you go to the website

2889
02:43:54,600 --> 02:44:07,780
which is um wp7 super secret access dot elo milo that's i l o m i l o dot com so wp7 super

2890
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:14,640
secret access dot elo milo dot com you should um uh copy paste that link in chat so our

2891
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:19,740
chatters can just click it and go get their game if they want it sounds like fun of course

2892
02:44:19,740 --> 02:44:24,460
that's just the demo though you demo but you can buy the full one by the game through that

2893
02:44:24,460 --> 02:44:29,280
so you can be playing the full game technically before it's released but you know all right
