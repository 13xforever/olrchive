0	20100	Tonight, November 7th, 2010, the new Xbox Connect dashboard is designed for pirates.
20100	22960	Capcom brings Retro Arcade to the iFamily.
22960	32400	And as Microsoft swept indie games under the rug.
32400	35680	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of that video
35680	39520	game talk show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39520	41880	It is episode number 388 of our show.
41880	46200	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura,
46200	47200	Jamie Sommers.
47200	51000	What have you got me on Rob?
51000	54300	It's Knights of the Old Sorority, I was telling you, or whatever this is.
54300	58240	It's Knights of the Crystals on Facebook, but it's just sorority life for the Final
58240	59240	Fantasy characters.
59240	61440	Yeah, I'm gonna stop playing this now.
61440	62800	Oh, you're no fun at all.
62800	65840	I'll play it after the show, I'm being responsible.
65840	66840	You should concentrate on the show.
66840	67840	What do I save?
67840	68840	There will be plenty of time.
68840	69840	You just close it.
69840	70840	It saves as you go.
70840	72940	The internet is a modern miracle.
72940	75120	Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
75120	76120	Hello.
76120	77120	How are you doing, Loki?
77120	78120	I'm doing fine.
78120	79120	Did you have a good week off, everybody?
79120	80120	Yeah, it was fun.
80120	81120	Yeah.
81120	82120	I didn't have a week off.
82120	83120	Why?
83120	84120	What'd you do?
84120	85120	Recorded another podcast.
85120	86120	Oh, yeah, you had the other show.
86120	89480	Hey, hey, I started a new show, too, so you're not the only one that gets to plug a show
89480	90480	now.
90480	91480	Ha!
91480	92480	Guess what?
92480	93480	What?
93480	94480	We still have a thing to do.
94480	97480	Actually, we only taped a pilot, so we're not really a show yet, because I don't have
97480	98480	a place to host it.
98480	99480	Is it a pilot light?
99480	101320	Yeah, it just means, is the show gonna work or not?
101320	102320	Go for the Frankenstein, please.
102320	104120	Anyway, I'll get into that in a minute.
104120	105960	We'll talk about other side projects in a moment.
105960	109720	I do want to introduce, of course, as always, our fourth guest always here with us, the
109720	115520	chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, live on this Sunday evening as we tape at All Games
115520	119420	Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
119420	121960	Every Sunday night is when we tape Orange Lounge Radio.
121960	126160	Anyhow, right after the Bobby Blackwell show, of course, I gotta plug Bobby, because he's
126160	127840	always been there.
127840	132160	He calls himself the opening act, but, you know, I don't see it as a lesser billing.
132160	135720	He's a smart guy, knows a lot about gaming, so tune into his show sometime if you haven't
135720	136720	already.
136720	139000	Anyhow, we're gonna get into How Was Your Gaming Week.
139000	141400	It's always how they start the show.
141400	143000	We are back from a week off.
143000	147520	One week ago was Halloween, so we just decided, you know what, let's just take a weekend off.
147520	149160	There's a lot going on in the real world.
149160	153120	I had a bunch of stuff to do for one of my other hobbies, so we didn't even tape a show.
153120	154520	You know, Logie's got the baby.
154520	158480	Dark Soccer's got, I guess, other podcasts now that are bigger than this little shit
158480	159480	show.
159480	160480	No, I have a big fat hairy cat.
160480	161480	Oh, you do?
161480	162480	Who has a Twitter?
162480	163480	I saw this.
163480	164480	Yeah, Shermy has a Twitter.
164480	165480	When did Shermy get a Twitter?
165480	166480	A few days ago.
166480	167480	Who signed her up for Twitter?
167480	168480	Was that you or was that a fan?
168480	169480	No.
169480	170480	That was me.
170480	171480	Oh, okay.
171480	174400	But she does all the typing, right?
174400	176500	She has me to do it because she's lazy.
176500	179200	It's Shermy O-L-R S-H-E-R-M-I-E O-L-R.
179200	183020	Yes, Shermy has his own, or her own Twitter now.
183020	184520	She twitched when you said his.
184520	185880	I'm sorry, Shermy.
185880	186880	Don't poop on me.
186880	188000	It was funny.
188000	192080	This morning when I was recording the other thing, she actually, I put my foot down and
192080	198240	she rolls over and wraps her little stubby legs around my foot and hugs my foot and starts
198240	199240	licking my toe.
199240	200240	Good times.
200240	202640	That's what I have to deal with sitting in that chair.
202640	204640	She doesn't do it to you.
204640	205640	No.
205640	206640	That's because Rob's feet smell.
206640	208120	My feet are smelly.
208120	209520	Let's quickly plug the side projects.
209520	212120	Usually we'll save this for the end of the show because this was brought up a minute
212120	213120	ago.
213120	215960	Dark Soccer, you have a side project called?
215960	217620	Comic Insanity.
217620	223020	It's Insanity without an I in the front of it, so there's only one I and not two.
223020	229200	It's at Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net and we go live on Tuesdays.
229200	230200	Awesome.
230200	234640	And it's just comic books, although today we were without a Mara and Marvel.
234640	235640	Sad.
235640	237560	Yeah, because she has a new house or something.
237560	238560	I don't know.
238560	239560	No.
239560	240560	Hard, hard, hard.
240560	247400	Um, but, uh, but it's me and Tiara, Mara and Marvel and Dan Shadow.
247400	248400	Good times.
248400	249400	Who, we're our group.
249400	250400	Who plays well with me now.
250400	251400	Who plays well with you now.
251400	252400	Yes.
252400	254960	But, uh, I don't play well with you.
254960	255960	Nope.
255960	259760	You're, both Mara and Marvel and Dan Shadow play well with me, but not you.
259760	260760	I'm not a sheep.
260760	261760	That's fine.
261760	262760	That's fine.
262760	263760	Speaking of well.
263760	264760	I play Star Trek.
264760	266560	Speaking of well, that's my new side project.
266560	268280	Xtaphir and I have reunited.
268280	272040	For those that listened to OLR back when it was a station, before the whole merger with
272040	275880	all games some time ago, we were doing a show called Guys on a Show, which is more like
275880	278340	a pop culture thing, but now we do a Warcraft show.
278340	281920	We just did a pilot, so the first episode, the first real episode will go up this week
281920	283840	because there were some problems with the pilot, namely audio.
283840	287680	The audio quality was not that great because of some of the, we don't tape it here in the
287680	290080	OLR studio, we tape it in my house.
290080	292480	So the sound quality was kind of meh.
292480	295360	If you want to get the pilot episode, the only place you can really find it is on my
295360	298200	Twitter and I might have posted it to the OLR Facebook, I don't remember.
298200	300120	If I didn't, I will tonight.
300120	303720	Twitter.com slash SKIE is where you can follow me on Twitter.
303720	308360	And the pilot episode there, the show is called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.
308360	311040	I think it's very sad that it had to be explained.
311040	314760	Also known as Horde House for sure, or we just, we really call it Horde House because,
314760	316640	but you know, it's funny.
316640	318200	So that's, that's our show.
318200	319200	I love the name.
319200	320200	Thank you.
320200	323000	It was suggested actually by Mel B, our old pal.
323000	324000	Anyhow, let's uh-
324000	325000	Who's at Disneyland right now?
325000	326160	I know, bastard.
326160	328780	I've been getting a picture like every three hours from Melody.
328780	329920	I hate her.
329920	330920	Not really though.
330920	333800	All right, let's talk video games and the games we've been playing this two weeks because
333800	334800	it's been a little while since we did a show.
334800	335800	I guess it says Guys on an MMO.
335800	340680	Guys on an MMO, kind of, kind of, because when DC Universe comes out, I know I want
340680	343960	to check that out and Final Fantasy XIV.
343960	344960	Just kidding.
344960	345960	All right.
345960	346960	DarkShackler, what have you been playing this week?
346960	351880	I did play some Star Trek Online and finally, now that I have a shiny new headset, I've
351880	357720	been able to play on TeamSpeak with my Scottish guild mates, or fleet mates I should say,
357720	360560	and I love listening to Scottish accents a whole lot.
360560	364200	Actually, one of the other guys is I think in Holland and one of the other guys was in
364200	365200	New York.
365200	367040	When we're playing, we have another guy in Hawaii.
367040	370000	There's I think like three or four of us who live in the United States.
370000	376120	The rest all live in the UK and other places in Europe, but it's pretty fun.
376120	381560	I only get to see them when it's like before four here because then it's, you know, close
381560	389880	to midnight there and then I, okay Rob, don't hate.
389880	390880	Don't judge me.
390880	391880	Judging.
391880	393760	Getting ready to judge.
393760	394760	Gavel raised.
394760	404200	I got Second Life so that I could see what the stupid Na'vi universe look like.
404200	405200	Wow.
405200	409960	Well, it's because I, I, you are guilty of nerd-dom.
409960	411480	Oh my God.
411480	416200	Well, I wanted to see, I wanted to, I said, you know, before I actually judged Second
416200	419040	Life, I was going to see what it's like.
419040	420040	That's fair.
420040	422280	I guess you should try something.
422280	428440	And I figured I would go to, instead of dressing up as a big smurf and running around, instead
428440	432960	of doing, you know, I would try to do something that I couldn't really do in another game
432960	433960	online.
433960	437720	Cause I, I kind of, I thought it would be a great idea for them to do like an avatar
437720	438720	MMO.
438720	443760	I guess that thing would be lose all self respect.
443760	447560	And I've only been on it like four times just running around and going, Oh, this is pretty,
447560	449120	Oh, this is pretty.
449120	453480	Second Life controls like shit, just letting you all know.
453480	455640	The chat on there sucks.
455640	457520	Controls like it is.
457520	462440	And I, it was free, okay.
462440	467800	In our chat room, SalaciousPop at chat.orangelandrady.com says, I am jumping in front of Jamie in slow
467800	474480	motion going, no, it's a terrorist bomb counts down to zero.
474480	477820	I mean, get some self respect.
477820	484320	Play a Harry Potter universe if you have to, Rob, I'm just, I'm messing with you.
484320	492840	Well, at any rate, it's, it's not horrible, but after seeing some of the other stuff on
492840	494840	there, I was like, yeah, I don't really have to play this that much.
494840	496440	I've actually got a good game to play.
496440	501440	Um, we got Rock Band 3, so we played a lot of Rock Band 3 since a few days ago.
501440	506480	We actually got it on Halloween, so we've been playing it since then.
506480	510040	Um, I'm trying to think what else, cause I've played a lot of games.
510040	511040	Did you guys get the keyboard?
511040	512040	Yes, we did.
512040	513040	Have you tried it?
513040	514040	I don't like it.
514040	517920	It hurts my hand after a while cause I want to hold the right keyboard position and it
517920	518920	makes my hand hurt.
518920	522240	Oh yeah, cause you had all the, um, surgery issues previously.
522240	523240	And I can't drum.
523240	524240	I can't drum at all.
524240	525240	What do you do?
525240	526240	Sing?
526240	527240	Yeah, pretty much.
527240	528240	And sometimes I'll play guitar.
528240	529240	Okay.
529240	533680	But even that after a while it hurts my hand, but because I, um, I play kind of like bass
533680	538520	style where you pluck up instead of strum down, it doesn't hurt as much.
538520	544480	So um, so I played that, Dan has beaten Fable 3, like within a few days of getting the game.
544480	549640	Um, my, uh, my pro tip to everybody, make sure you have 6 million gold by the time you
549640	556320	actually beat that part of the game, the first, by the time you're the king, or queen, or
556320	558000	whatever you're gonna be.
558000	563440	Um, I love all the voices in that game because, seriously, Jonathan Ross is in it.
563440	567440	Doing announcement when you're beating up, um, monsters, and I love it.
567440	570280	I love Jonathan Ross.
570280	575720	He's the one with the slight speech impediment, where he speaks with the ahs and not the r's.
575720	579160	Um, and, uh, oh.
579160	580680	House Fable 3, like, similar and different.
580680	582080	Simon Pegg does voices in it.
582080	583080	I love him.
583080	587840	House, by the way, somebody, uh, came to Rocky, which was the thing I was doing last week
587840	588840	and not here at the show.
588840	592560	We had a costume contest, the winner was dressed up as Sean from Sean of the Dead, and it was
592560	593640	like A+.
593640	594640	It was perfect.
594640	595640	The guy looked the part and everything.
595640	596640	Oh.
596640	597640	A+.
597640	598640	I would have to glomp on him.
598640	603160	Um, but, you were saying, how does it play?
603160	606600	I was gonna say, how's Fable 3 compared to the last one of Fable 2?
606600	608620	It's got lots of good and lots of bad.
608620	613920	The quest thing, instead of being able to just change your quest and thing, you don't
613920	615240	even have a menu anymore.
615240	621560	You go back to this sanctuary, and, um, and then if you're trying to find a person to
621560	625080	start a particular quest, it doesn't always teleport you right to them.
625080	627400	Oh, Rob's gonna give us diseases.
627400	628400	Sorry.
628400	629400	No.
629400	633440	I have stuff going on, I have to do eye drops every three hours.
633440	634440	Rob's a zombie.
634440	635440	It's time.
635440	636440	Yeah, I'm a zombie.
636440	637440	Brains.
637440	639640	Um, but, no, it's-
639640	640640	Navi!
640640	641640	Shut up.
641640	644560	But, uh, it's not bad.
644560	648320	I mean, there's definitely some, a lot of glitchiness in it, and you know what really
648320	654760	sucks is that when you have to take people places, you can't just tell them to follow
654760	655760	you.
655760	659360	You have to hold their hand and take them with you.
659360	660960	And that's really irritating.
660960	667560	And also, I can see the seam on the dog in the textures, and it's kind of, meh, creepy.
667560	669800	Dogs do have seams, though.
669800	671740	Yeah, but not like that.
671740	675280	Not from the top of their head to the base of their tail.
675280	676280	Sure they do.
676280	677280	No.
677280	681080	He'd be expecting to see stitches or something.
681080	682880	And then there's like a bunch of annoying people.
682880	687780	I love one of the quote bad guys in the game, Reaver.
687780	691520	He's just so ostentatious, I love him.
691520	697520	And he's so evil and such a bastard, I love him to death.
697520	702960	And then I played Robot Unicorn Attack in the middle of Starbucks at 11 o'clock last
702960	704960	night.
704960	712640	And we had one of mine and Dan's friends over beat Little Nemo, the Dream Master, on Nintendo
712640	714320	in our vault last night.
714320	715320	Wow, random.
715320	717440	That game's actually kind of hard, you know?
717440	722240	God, I played a bunch of other stuff, too.
722240	724960	I beat Peggle Knights.
724960	726820	It's actually kind of hard.
726820	732000	It's harder than the first Peggle.
732000	736120	Lots of Plants vs. Zombies, I've almost done growing my tree of life.
736120	741440	Or whatever, the tree of knowledge or whatever the crap the tree is.
741440	744120	Is the tree of worthless advice is what it is.
744120	745440	Okay, then.
745440	748720	Stuff I've already figured out, but you get an achievement for it, so whatever.
748720	753080	And for anyone who has beaten mustache mode, all you have to do is just type mustache while
753080	757440	you're playing and all the zombies will get mustaches and you'll be in mustache mode.
757440	758760	Kay.
758760	761960	I know, it's completely retarded.
761960	764480	I love how stupid that game is.
764480	768040	And I know I played a bunch of stuff this week.
768040	771560	Oh yeah, and I played Dance Masters tonight.
771560	772560	And I did Pala Pala.
772560	773560	Dancing.
773560	778560	What did you think of Dance Masters on the Xbox Kinect, the other dance game?
778560	780960	I liked Para Para.
780960	783960	I know, that Night of Fire you were doing was just the Para Para dance.
783960	786480	And you were playing on easy mode, so it was less restrictive.
786480	789240	You only had to get like one out of every eight beats right.
789240	792040	I'm imagining the harder levels are like really kinda picky.
792040	796480	I don't know, I think I remembered it pretty well, so I should be able to do it on hard.
796480	797840	You did pretty good for what it looked like.
797840	798840	Yeah.
798840	799840	What did you think of the Kinect as a device?
799840	800840	You were watching Loki and I playing it a little bit.
800840	802480	I thought it was freakin' hilarious.
802480	810400	Especially, okay, they were playing Dance Central and there's like this little solo
810400	815700	freestyle part in it and Rob was going in and shaking his butt and jumping up and down.
815700	819840	And then it plays back in high speed, so you see Rob peeking out, Rob peeking out, Rob's
819840	822280	butt.
822280	828120	And you just see Loki kind of flailing, because he was actually doing stuff, but when it speeds
828120	830640	it up it looks like he's flailing.
830640	832800	Kind of what the Kinect is, it's the Microsoft flail.
832800	834480	Yeah, the Microsoft flail.
834480	835480	Good times.
835480	836480	I like that.
836480	837480	That's what I'm going to call it for now on.
837480	840200	Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
840200	841200	Bam!
841200	842200	Which is what I'm going to take a picture of.
842200	843200	Alright, you do that.
843200	844200	A little Para CD.
844200	849040	No, Dan and I found a bunch of our video game soundtracks, so we've been ripping them, and
849040	854080	I found a VCD of Para Para Panic, volume 2 and 3.
854080	855080	Good times.
855080	857840	I also found a Para Para DVD that belongs to Loki.
857840	858840	Random.
858840	860480	The Para Para Master.
860480	862480	Loki's like, that ain't mine.
862480	863480	Para Para Master?
863480	865800	Yeah, you loaned it to me like five years ago.
865800	867800	I don't even remember that.
867800	868800	Hold on.
868800	869800	Alright.
869800	870800	Okay, everybody else.
870800	873680	Going to the chatroom real quick, Spaznator in our chatroom says, if someone were to put
873680	877680	Abba, our Rocky Horror Picture Show, Dan Central, and Sing Star into a blender, and then puked
877680	880680	out the resulting game, Sky would probably squeal.
880680	883560	Uh, yeah, probably.
883560	887760	Let's see, uh, ssta100matt, this has nothing to do with video games, whatever, we'll entertain
887760	888760	this.
888760	891740	He says, by the way, I want to hear Rob's review on the Glee Rocky Horror Picture Show
891740	892740	episode.
892740	898120	Okay, so ssta100matt wants to hear my review on the Glee Rocky Horror Picture Show episode.
898120	904160	Here you go, it stinks!
904160	906040	It was okay, I guess.
906040	910000	I like the message at the end, but otherwise it's kind of censored and dopey.
910000	911000	Alright.
911000	912000	What is this?
912000	913000	It's a kid's bot.
913000	917960	Alright, uh, Loki, you want to talk about- This must have been something I got for free
917960	923800	back when I was wearing VCDs, because I remember this, get VCDs dot com, special price, must
923800	924800	have been free.
924800	928280	Um, yeah, stuff that I- Hi, you're gaming week, yes.
928280	932880	Stuff I played this week, of course I got the Kinect as well, a little bit earlier than
932880	937400	most because I like hunting on eBay sometimes.
937400	943680	Uh, with it came with actually one of the new S systems, so I have a nice new slimmer
943680	944680	system.
944680	949280	Um, so I've been playing a few things, you know, Kinect adventures a little bit, which
949280	953120	is, you know, it's a kind of fun pack-in game, I guess.
953120	955360	You know, pretty basic stuff on there.
955360	961280	Um, I started off playing some of the demos for Joyride and Dance Central, and really
961280	965720	the demo for Dance Central, which is on the disc, so, um, you know, if they put it on
965720	970360	Xbox Live Marketplace, you don't really need to download it because it's already on the
970360	971360	disc.
971360	978040	Um, it's only got two songs on the demo, which were, um, Poker Face by Lady Gaga and Poison.
978040	985280	Um, Poison is a lot more difficult than Poker Face, that's for sure, because I'm like,
985280	989760	okay, Poker Face, that was really easy, I'm gonna go in the Poison, and it's like, okay,
989760	991520	break it down, do this.
991520	994320	I'm like, I can't do that.
994320	999560	You know, some 90s dance moves and stuff, but I think actually if you play through,
999560	1004720	um, Dance Central, through the songs in the actual order that they're in there, uh, from
1004720	1008240	easiest to hardest, I think it'd be a lot easier to pick up some of the stuff, because
1008240	1013920	some of the moves are just, it's a little tough for me to wrap my brain around it.
1013920	1015680	Um, but yeah, it's a fun game.
1015680	1021400	Um, played Dance Masters a little bit, um, or I should say I watched Dance Masters a
1021400	1025680	little bit, because the thing that's really frustrating about that game, although I have
1025680	1032240	to say I didn't try the lesson modes, so maybe that breaks it down a little bit more, but
1032240	1035520	it basically says, okay, go.
1035520	1038440	And then it starts doing stuff and you start messing up because you don't know what the
1038440	1043960	hell you're supposed to be doing, and that's it, and you just act confused, unless of course
1043960	1048440	you've played lots of Para Para, and you know some of the Para Para dances, in which case,
1048440	1052720	there's at least four songs you'll be able to do just fine, um, but the rest of them
1052720	1055400	are just very confusing.
1055400	1061160	A lot of songs from DDR, a ton of songs from DDR, um, everything from, you know, the Para
1061160	1069680	Para songs to, uh, Sakura, Exotic Ethnic, uh, Let the Beat Hit Em, um, Keep on Movin',
1069680	1076040	um, Higher, I'm trying to think of some of the other songs that were in there, um, but
1076040	1082240	yeah, a lot of DDR stuff, and honestly, as Rob was saying when, um, he was actually looking
1082240	1085360	at the game, the game looks a lot better than Dance Central.
1085360	1090440	Yeah, I was surprised, Dance Masters is actually like a better looking game than Dance Central,
1090440	1095440	like it, just the inter-, it, the way you watch it play out is a lot cooler than those
1095440	1097400	little like flashcards going up the side.
1097400	1101020	I think the flashcards going up the side makes the dance like impracticality, like you said,
1101020	1104280	it's easier to learn that way, whereas it's just kind of like throw it in and do it, but
1104280	1106880	like if you're just kind of like trying to show off the poses and stuff, I think with
1106880	1111000	like the silhouettes collapsing in and the rings that show up, I think the game looks
1111000	1115600	awesome, and like I think if you were to like pull it off the way you're supposed to, which,
1115600	1118280	I know some folks might be surprised, they were expecting me to come on here and say
1118280	1122640	Dance Masters is full of fail, but there's some interesting parts in there, like I think
1122640	1126520	that the interface itself is pretty sleek when you're playing the game, I like the look
1126520	1127520	a lot.
1127520	1132120	It's interesting, you know, as far as like some of the songs that are in there and stuff,
1132120	1136440	because I think it'd be fun to see what the routines are for them, um, obviously, and
1136440	1141440	this goes for both games, there are some songs like, for example, Poker Face and stuff that
1141440	1146960	I would feel like an idiot doing, you know, in real life versus, you know, some of the
1146960	1151040	songs, you know, like Poison and stuff that have really good dance steps to them, I mean
1151040	1154960	obviously they have the simple, you know, have some simple songs in there so you can
1154960	1159120	learn, because, you know, a lot of it is like, oh, I could do that, but it's actually really
1159120	1162160	hard sometimes to figure out what they want you to do, and you have to kind of do it a
1162160	1167280	few times to be able to understand what you need to do in the game, but, Dance Masters,
1167280	1171340	the other thing I don't like about Dance Masters is the actual menus, the way they have you
1171340	1176160	navigate it is not very intuitive, and a lot of times they end up selecting things they
1176160	1181520	didn't want to select, um, was it Dance Central? No, Dance Masters, I have problems with Dance
1181520	1185360	Central, I don't know if that's just the Kinect device itself, but, like, trying to select
1185360	1191440	a song is a pain in the ass sometimes on Dance Central, yeah, um, the thing with Dance Central
1191440	1195120	though is you can actually use the controller to select stuff if you want to, oh, didn't
1195120	1200560	even try it, derp derp, um, so that's kind of neat, um, and then other things, can I
1200560	1203520	say this real quick though about Dance Central, some of those moves are kind of embarrassing
1203520	1206920	too, this is Dance Central, again, we've been kind of going back and forth between the Dance
1206920	1211520	Masters, yeah, they are, here's the easiest way to remember, Dance Central has real songs,
1211520	1217440	Dance Masters has DDR songs, like, which, you know, I realize some people consider them
1217440	1222240	real songs, I don't mean to, you know, spit in the eye of what we grew up on, but it's
1222240	1227160	not music you're gonna hear out in the real world, if you're a fan of DDR, and you know,
1227160	1230160	you buy Dance Masters, you probably think, oh, originally you're like, okay, well I know
1230160	1234540	Para stuff is gonna be in there, and you think, oh, it's just all Para Para dancing, well,
1234540	1238480	they have, like, a lot of songs from DDR, and it was kind of cool to see a lot of stuff
1238480	1243320	on there, but there's really only a couple songs that weren't in DDR, or at least I didn't
1243320	1248800	recognize in DDR. I think though, those of you guys that, like, grew up on DDR, and have
1248800	1253160	been playing for years and years, ever logged into, if you had an account on DDR Freak at
1253160	1258420	any point in time, go buy Dance Masters, the rest of you, get Dance Central, that's, that's
1258420	1264280	really how it kind of breaks down. Dance Central I like because I've, long time ago, I actually
1264280	1269080	took a dance class, and the way they teach you how to do the different routines is the
1269080	1274560	way you would learn it in a dance class, which is kind of cool, so I enjoy that game a lot
1274560	1278680	more because it actually, you get an idea of what you're supposed to do, even though
1278680	1281860	they do have the flashcards, if that's not for you, if you just wanna, you know, you
1281860	1287060	know the routine, you just wanna do it, you can turn those flashcards off. Anybody who's
1287060	1292120	ever loved Para Para Paradise or even liked it, you need to get Dance Masters, because
1292120	1296100	it basically is Para Para Paradise under a different name, and just a different gameplay
1296100	1301800	mechanic, but like, the Night of Fire dance is the same dance. Yes, it is. You know, so,
1301800	1304800	it's something, remember, like way back in the day, I was like, hey, know what'd be kind
1304800	1309000	of cool is if they had a Para game with like, you know, different genres of music in there,
1309000	1314280	not just Para Para, that's Dance Masters, it's basically, funny, you know. Let me go
1314280	1317000	back to Dance Central for a minute, because Loki was talking about some of the embarrassing
1317000	1320040	dance moves that happened in that game, and I'll tell you, I don't know if you've, have
1320040	1324240	you played, you haven't really played the demo, outside the demo, huh? Not too much,
1324240	1328200	no. Okay, I was playing the full version, I was playing, there's a song by M.I.A. called
1328200	1331120	Galang, and I don't know if you've ever heard this song, but let me play a little bit of
1331120	1337320	it for listeners here in, listening to this song. This is an awesome song, yeah, I really
1337320	1344320	like this song, but like, the way you dance to this song, is like, you like, hop, bend
1344320	1348840	over, shake your butt, it's like, like the dance you're doing is like, really embarrassing,
1348840	1354360	but, it's kinda, I, when it all comes together, I think it looks pretty cool. Dance Masters,
1354360	1358080	supposedly, and I haven't actually checked it out yet, I think there's a way that you
1358080	1363320	can actually customize, like, the dances in there, like you can create your own, like
1363320	1368680	an edit mode almost. Dance Central? Dance Masters. Oh, I can't tell them apart! Dance
1368680	1372280	Central, I'm surprised that they didn't have that, because they have all the moves broken
1372280	1376400	down, you should be able to just order them in a way, you know, to create a routine, and
1376400	1382480	it wouldn't be that difficult for the actual on-screen dancers to follow it. Dance Central
1382480	1388440	is very much a first game, as is Dance Masters. I mean, you have to go, okay, Dance Central
1388440	1394880	is like the first Guitar Hero game, which led to Guitar Hero 2, which led to Rock Band
1394880	1399120	and Guitar Hero 3, which led to, you know, where we're at now with, like, Rock Band 3.
1399120	1403320	So the potential is there for something really cool, but this first game is definitely like
1403320	1409000	a bare bones thing, but it'll, it'll be a hit at parties. Either one will be, really.
1409000	1415960	It'll be pretty fun. Other things I played, Connect Joyride, which I enjoyed, you know,
1415960	1420520	some people have trouble controlling the game, but I actually had no problems with it, and
1420520	1423320	I actually thought it was pretty fun, and I played the demo that was on the disc and
1423320	1428800	I ended up buying it. A couple reasons why I bought it, one, because it looked fun, and
1428800	1434200	two, it was one of the games I was able to get early. And then also Connect Sports, which
1434200	1439160	I actually haven't touched yet, so I can't really give any impressions on. I do still
1439160	1446200	want to get possibly yourself fitness, or your shape fitness, or whatever the hell it's
1446200	1450960	called, just to try that out, because right now, I mean, I can't get out to the gym even
1450960	1454760	if I wanted to. There's just no time of the day, and I think it would be nice to have
1454760	1459840	some sort of exercise program, and honestly, I would prefer getting the EA Sports Active
1459840	1465920	2.0 one, because it looks like it's a lot more structured. They actually have a nine
1465920	1470840	week program you can go through, and a bunch of neat features for that. The problem is
1470840	1477240	it's 100 bucks, and I really don't want to spend $100 on a game, even if it does work
1477240	1483560	out pretty well, but I don't know. It would be neat to just try that stuff, because it
1483560	1488320	looks like that might work pretty well. But yeah, I'm looking forward to more stuff. Hopefully
1488320	1492880	they actually start having indie games, and Xbox Live Arcade games that support Connect
1492880	1497680	stuff, and hopefully we get into some more different types of games other than stuff.
1497680	1501000	Yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing the different genres, you know? Okay, because
1501000	1508760	all the games that are launched are like dance, fitness, interpretations of Wii games from
1508760	1514880	their launch party, but we have yet to see how is Connect going to affect Gears of War,
1514880	1519480	if at all. Like, I'm not, please hear me out, I'm not saying every game needs to have Connect
1519480	1523760	shoved in it. In fact, that would make me very disappointed. But I'm saying like a Gears
1523760	1527480	of War-esque kind of series that uses Connect. And I don't think you need to go too crazy
1527480	1531200	with some of that stuff. I think it would be neat to have a game where you play it on
1531200	1536640	the couch, it just supports Connect, but you're still using the controller. Say for example,
1536640	1542120	you're peeking around a corner or something, you just lean with your controller in hand,
1542120	1546160	you lean to the side and your character peeks around the corner instead of you having to
1546160	1552160	hit a button or something like that. Just really, you know, subtle stuff. I don't think
1552160	1557080	you need to actually flail around or something, but I think adding a little bit of extra stuff,
1557080	1563360	you know, or maybe like voice commands to different things might be kind of neat. Just
1563360	1570280	do it tastefully, you know? Don't have like, Halo Connect, you know? And something you
1570280	1573080	touched on a little bit there that I wanted to definitely mention and expand on a little
1573080	1577560	bit is the more minority report style stuff that's in the Xbox Connect, meaning that it
1577560	1582640	will identify your face and sign you in. If you have to calibrate, you have to go through
1582640	1588320	this somewhat extensive calibration in Connect ID, and for it to work really well, you have
1588320	1591680	to do it like in the daytime, in the nighttime, with all your lights on, with some of your
1591680	1596040	lights on, you have to do it a few times. But if you do, then when you go into the Connect
1596040	1602040	Hub, which you can do just by yelling at your Xbox, Xbox, Connect, and it will go into the
1602040	1605640	Connect Hub. And if it can see your face, it will scan and it will go, oh, hey, Rob,
1605640	1608680	what you doing? You know, not really like that, but you know, it'll, it'll, hey, Rob,
1608680	1612920	what you doing? Hey, girl, what it do? No, it's not going to do that, okay? It's just
1612920	1618560	like, but it'll, I will not have to pick up a controller at all. In fact, I have gone
1618560	1625040	so far as to eject the game, put in the new game, walk away, and then it'll go Xbox, Connect,
1625040	1630760	close tray. And it knows who I am, starts, and closes the tray. I mean, it's, it's kind
1630760	1635280	of scary in some regards, but neat. I want to see that expanded on though, because it's
1635280	1639160	very limited right now. There's only very certain commands. Like, you can't be like
1639160	1643480	Xbox, paint my house. You know, it's not going to, it's not going to know how to do anything
1643480	1650000	but like close the tray and go to your friends list, you know? And then also, you know, like,
1650000	1654840	the fact that actually those voice commands work with pretty much anybody. You know, my
1654840	1658720	wife is like, you know, yelling stuff out. She's like, haha, I can hear fear through
1658720	1663520	your stuff without having to steal your controller. I can run in front of you and the game detects
1663520	1668520	me and it'll screw up your game. Haha. I heard though, it doesn't see people behind you.
1668520	1671680	It doesn't see people behind me. She runs in front of me. Oh, okay. And it sometimes
1671680	1676400	does that and sometimes it, sometimes it won't even get confused at all. It's just, it's
1676400	1681920	really interesting. The other thing, completely unrelated to actually playing Connect games,
1681920	1687000	which this isn't really a feature for a lot of people, but for me, since I have an infant
1687000	1692720	it is, the nice little calibration cards that come with a lot of the games that are high
1692720	1696520	contrast, black and white, it's a little... What do they do? It's for calibrating the
1696520	1699800	system. I have yet to use them. Well, you can use it to calibrate the system. It takes,
1699800	1704000	it's a little smiley face and it says, you know, place this so that the glasses are on
1704000	1708440	the smiley face and you see, you move it back and forth and it calibrates the sensor that,
1708440	1712320	you know, get distance or whatever you're running. Where is that? What do you, in the
1712320	1717480	dashboard? Uh, and then the little connect dashboard thing. I've done it once. Anyways,
1717480	1723560	but that's not the point. The point is my son loves staring at that thing and just like
1723560	1730560	plays with it and just like, and smiling is so happy, is literally his favorite toy. Loki,
1730560	1734640	I'm just saying you could go get like a little piece of cardboard at Target for like 10 cents
1734640	1738960	and a Sharpie marker. You can make a million of those. Oh, I know that, but I'm just saying
1738960	1743880	it's, it's an added bonus because they, they come with a bunch of them. Cause I, I got
1743880	1747680	it and you know, with it and says, do not throw this away. I'm like, the hell is this?
1747680	1751640	Um, so you know, do I have to hold this in front of the camera? And Bobby Blackwolf in
1751640	1754560	our chat room is, is echoing you. It's in the connect tuner on the connect hub. I thought
1754560	1758480	I went through that setup. So there's a whole nother calibration. There's another calibration
1758480	1763600	set up. There's a lot of calibrating to do with this, but it's been working fine without
1763600	1766480	all that fine calibration except the fact that I live in a tiny apartment and don't
1766480	1769840	have a lot of space. Yeah. That only means that you can't play connected ventures to
1769840	1774120	player because it requires not going to have feet, you know, or whatever in order to play
1774120	1777880	two players on that. A lot of the other games don't do, you know, really give a crap. In
1777880	1781280	fact, you know, I'd say, you know, Jamie's living room here. That mean that was maybe
1781280	1786160	like six feet. Yeah, it worked. If that it was just fine. I had no problem with it. Just
1786160	1790400	a little para para. Yeah. It's just connected ventures I think is really, I don't even know
1790400	1795160	if it necessarily needs that. It's just that they don't want you smacking into each other.
1795160	1800400	Yeah. Have you done the video chat at all? No, it's really creepy. Try it because the
1800400	1804300	connect will follow you around. Like I was sitting in the chair, like I wasn't actually
1804300	1807240	chatting with anyone, but you can see your window. And then like if I, if I stand up,
1807240	1811240	like the connect follows me and if I kind of move it, like it follows you around, which
1811240	1815280	is kind of creepy. You can only move up and down, right? Yeah. But well it also will zoom
1815280	1819440	in and pan left and right as it zooms it. Like it's zooming in on your face. Yeah. It's
1819440	1823960	kind of, kind of creepster, but cool. I liked it. I'm going to chat room and some comments
1823960	1829600	at chat.orangelandtrady.com. Um, Oh yes. Marissa con gusto in our chair and says, I do not
1829600	1832960	want a system that hits on me or notices if I have gained weight. Oh, that would be a
1832960	1839480	terrible wouldn't it? You know, X-Box connect. Hi Rob. Oh, you might want to stop eating
1839480	1843040	donuts. I thought they were having a feature or there was something, maybe it was in the
1843040	1847920	one of those, like, you know, here's what it possibly can do, you know, or I'm scanning
1847920	1854000	my skateboard and that bullcrap. Um, where like it could scan your image and it makes
1854000	1857660	an avatar character out of that. Well, what's also going to be interesting is what future
1857660	1861560	firmware updates will do because the technology is there now. Now it's about really kind of
1861560	1866400	squeezing out the potential of it. I'm kind of curious to see what next year's update
1866400	1870800	will bring because probably more of this stuff. Browsing, it won't probably be just like you'll
1870800	1875340	be able to browse the marketplace or something like that. Dance masters fact sheet. Apparently
1875340	1880040	there is a lesson mode. Yeah, that would be nice because stepping right into the dance
1880040	1884860	mode is like, huh? Yeah. All right. Anything else for your gaming week? Um, yeah. Other
1884860	1891560	than X-Box and connect stuff, um, well actually I played rock band three briefly. I just got
1891560	1896880	around to it. So one of my systems actually died on me and I had it fixed. So, um, that
1896880	1903380	was nice. And, um, I played, well, I spent a lot of the time just recreating my band,
1903380	1909440	the uh, what was it? Unfit barf bags because that was the random, that was the random band
1909440	1914640	name he gave me in rock band two. And so I just stuck with it and it was funny. Um, actually
1914640	1918160	they had something about like, it was one of the first random names he gave me. It was
1918160	1923000	like talking about parakeets or something like that. I thought that was fancy. Ah, that
1923000	1929300	is a close second there. Good name. Just talk about parakeets. Uh, but anyways, so I ended
1929300	1933680	up playing, um, you know, the power of love on, um, the keyboards because I had to try
1933680	1937900	that out and it was awesome. Um, and then, okay, then other than was relatively easy
1937900	1942380	for keyboard though. Yeah. And I, of course I didn't bother doing keyboards in normal
1942380	1946200	mode because that's just retarded with the five keys. Um, I stuck with the pro mode and
1946200	1949560	just, you know, stick with easy. Well, if you actually want to be able to play things
1949560	1953880	like Bohemian Rhapsody, you got to do five key. Well, why can't you just play it on easy?
1953880	1957460	Oh, okay. Yeah, you can do it on easy. I mean, you can do easy in promo that I think that's
1957460	1962840	the way to do it. Um, but I've done a little bit of both. Like I can, I can actually be
1962840	1967120	just like heaven and imagine on like expert pro keys, but it took a little while to kind
1967120	1972000	of get there, but it's cool that I can do it after practicing. I had problems with,
1972000	1977640	you know, um, lining up my hands because you know, it like for example, the power of love
1977640	1982360	is more on the right side of the keyboard. And so I see stuff come down the center of
1982360	1987080	the screen. I'm thinking, Oh, hand in the center of the keyboard and it would be lined
1987080	1991360	up normally like if I was playing keyboard mania or something like that. But I had my
1991360	1996940	hands too far to the left. So other than that, other than Grand Theft Auto, um, some iPod
1996940	2002840	games have been playing or iOS games, I guess, um, mainly stick wars, which I mentioned was
2002840	2007720	kind of a rip off of the game defender castle. It's basically a game where you flick a stick
2007720	2012280	figures up in the air and kill them. And, uh, kind of a tower defense game. And of course
2012280	2016600	the other tower defense game also involving stick figures I've been playing was, um, cartoon
2016600	2025040	wars two, uh, tried that, tried a little bit of Sonic for episode one on the iPod. And,
2025040	2033040	uh, it's terrible as I figured it would be. Thankfully I didn't buy it. Um, and what else?
2033040	2040160	Um, Oh yeah. A little bit of a space invaders, uh, infinity gene, which I love that game.
2040160	2046200	It's pretty awesome. Um, that's pretty much it. Okay. We, I know we've been on the gaming
2046200	2049840	weeks for a while. Let me talk quickly, but we had a connect launch this week and a few
2049840	2054600	of us played it. Um, I had some, uh, stuff going on where I wasn't able to leave the
2054600	2057880	house this weekend. Long story. I don't want to get into it. Um, but I bought a connect
2057880	2061000	to hold me over. So I've been playing a lot of the same stuff we've already talked about
2061000	2066300	dance central, um, which is fine, but I, the interface bugs me like it doesn't control
2066300	2069840	very well, but now that I know about this extra calibration stuff, maybe I need to try
2069840	2073800	that. So now that I know and knowing is half the battle, um, I'll, I'll try that a little
2073800	2077480	more. But otherwise, like the dancers are kind of fun and it's a pretty good workout.
2077480	2081560	And that's, that's the best thing about connect is that it's a, it's a good calorie counter
2081560	2086520	for that. I noticed. Yeah. Oh yeah. I turned it on. It's, it's a good, um, the photo modes
2086520	2090760	a little creepy. I think I might need to turn that off cause I'm like, I don't like being
2090760	2095760	required to wear pants to play Xbox. You know what the connect adventures stuff, you know
2095760	2101200	how there's that connect share.com website. Yeah. Like I'm afraid that one day I'm going
2101200	2104360	to be sitting there playing with no pants on cause you know, look, it's the privacy
2104360	2108600	of my own house. Come on guys. You know, pants are restrictive. So sometimes you'd like to
2108600	2114400	play with no pants. So I was playing in my pajamas. Yeah. That's what I'll do now because
2114400	2118400	I am like deathly afraid that the machine is going to take a picture of me and like
2118400	2122760	upload it to my Facebook without me knowing. And I, I realized this is a totally irrational
2122760	2127020	fear and like, yes, these modes can be turned off, but come on. Like it's, it's like this,
2127020	2132160	this part of technology kind of freaks me out or it's like suddenly, you know, everybody's
2132160	2136960	going to know if it's boxers, boxers or briefs, you know, and I don't, there's certain things
2136960	2140560	that my Facebook friends do not need to know about and what color I'm wearing today is
2140560	2150400	one of them. You know what I mean? Yeah. So anyhow, I don't want people to see my completely
2150400	2154400	mismatched and way too big for me. Pajamas. That's like, that's, you know what, it's the
2154400	2159680	equivalent guys with pants are like women with bras. Like most women I talk to are like,
2159680	2167280	first thing I do when I get home, bras off. Well, and you don't want your connect. Take
2167280	2174480	a picture as you're jumping up and down and some of the jumblies going jumble, jumble,
2174480	2179580	jumble. Uh, look, look, look, I, I swear I didn't even look at you. I hear Jessica Harper's
2179580	2183360	in our chat tonight. Hell, I'd play braless. Well, I call it, did I call it or did I call
2183360	2188640	it? Thank you very much. I did after Loki was setting up the connectors I went in and
2188640	2195240	put on a sports bra because I didn't want to kill myself. Thank you. Jessica's backing
2195240	2200280	me up here. My house is a bra free zone. 100%. There you go. Uh, kitsune says, I don't want
2200280	2203320	people to see me in my undies, so I got to make sure I wear pants. That's, that's the
2203320	2209240	same completely irrational fear that I have. Like with this technology, the way it is like,
2209240	2214040	I need something in the intro to the game to assure me, hi Rob, I promise I won't take
2214040	2217720	pictures of you with no pants on. Then we'll be fine. Like as long as the connect and I
2217720	2222080	have that mutual understanding that we're not taking pictures, I'll be fine. Rob, but
2222080	2227480	we could have pencils rage. Rob. Now remember now, here's something to be afraid of, I guess.
2227480	2231360	Well, in fact, actually, I guess it doesn't really shine too much of a spot. Remember
2231360	2236440	those, uh, I think there were Sony cameras actually that had an infrared filter mode
2236440	2241000	or something like that, and people were using them to see through people's clothes. It might
2241000	2247440	not matter with the connect camera. They will, it will be undressing you with its lenses.
2247440	2253400	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, to be fair, connect share.com only shows your own photos or videos
2253400	2258360	that you upload from the game. You can't find anyone else's stuff. I, I, I just don't trust.
2258360	2263920	There's hackers out there, Bobby. They're hacking everyone on out here. You know, your
2263920	2268440	pants hide your bras. I want though with the connect, the fact that it shoots, you know,
2268440	2272960	infrared lights, you know, in a really neat, uh, you know, pattern across the room. I want
2272960	2276480	a laser light show. Damn it. Because it's already doing that. I want it so that I can
2276480	2280320	see it. Yes. The Michael Jackson game that's coming out should do a Michael Jackson laser
2280320	2285000	shows. Like the one I saw in Seattle last year. Um, am I the only one that feels like
2285000	2288280	I should not look directly into the connect? Cause there's that little red light that looks
2288280	2292280	like a laser, which I'm sure is the infrared. It is a laser. Oh my God. Have you ever caught
2292280	2297040	yourself staring right into it going, this isn't a good idea. Yes. Because it's like
2297040	2304000	the mind control device. It's like, wait a second. I recognize that red in your eye.
2304000	2309680	Your terminator sent back from the future to kill me. Oh, look what I started in chat
2309680	2314560	chat that orange on show.com satellite minded the climate in your windows. They're snatching
2314560	2326500	your pictures up. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Anyhow, moving on. Oh yes.
2326500	2329880	Other things I played this week. Let's see. I also played rock band three. You know, I
2329880	2332960	loves me some keyboards. My least favorite thing about rock band three is that there's
2332960	2337160	not enough songs to play with the keyboards because I have like 300 songs in my library
2337160	2340680	now, thanks to rock band one, rock band two, all the download stuff, which is a really
2340680	2345320	obscene amount. I really hope they go back soon and add the key support. Yes, I know
2345320	2349200	it's supposed to be coming, so I'll stop bitching, but that's the only thing that bugs me about
2349200	2353840	it. Otherwise, I think it's a fantastic upgrade. Uh, and if you own rock band two or rock band
2353840	2357960	one, drop the extra money, drop the 50, 60 bucks and get this. The whole dropping in
2357960	2362280	and out will be great for parties. I think the song select mode and being able to filter
2362280	2366120	stuff is so much more intuitive. I think they really have learned. They have just created
2366120	2369400	an incredible music game and it really makes me go the hell are we going to get in rock
2369400	2375080	band four and the sorting is already blowing my mind. Oh, the sorting is outstanding. Outstanding.
2375080	2379840	Um, real quick, just because it does kind of tie into the whole connect thing. What
2379840	2386940	do you think of the new dashboard? Um, it's not that different from the old one, although
2386940	2392920	how much have they tried to kind of emulate the Wii and right on down to the whole little
2392920	2404640	like little like background noises that you hear when you're in the, you know, kind of
2404640	2409480	what it sounds like when you're in the menus and just and all the cuteness and the, the,
2409480	2415360	it, it, how I don't like how white it has been inspired from a Nintendo. You got a problem
2415360	2421160	with white things? Yes, I do. Oh, sorry to hear that. Well, I don't know what to tell
2421160	2430320	you. I got nothing. All right. Uh, Black Wolf says they are adding Bon Jovi keyboard support
2430320	2434640	this week, so they're going through the back catalog. Yeah, I know. I know. And I'm just
2434640	2439800	impatient. So what if I have 63 songs to play right now? It's not enough. Plus some of the
2439800	2446720	keyboard parts are really dopey. Like, um, is it everybody wants to know that one? It's
2446720	2452440	the other one. Um, Oh, one of those songs that always get the bands mixed up. Tears
2452440	2456720	for fears is everyone wants to rule the world, right? In excess. Need you tonight is the
2456720	2463480	song has the dumbest keyboard part ever. It's just 27 notes even on expert. And it's just
2463480	2471620	do do do. And that's the keyboard part. Do do do. Wow. And so you're playing the wow
2471620	2476880	like 27 times in the song. It's ridiculous. Like you could beat it on expert and your
2476880	2486920	score will be like 4700 tops. This is funny. But anyhow, uh, yeah. Um, the game's fun and
2486920	2490280	the keyboard stuff will get better with the download packs and everything. You know, I'm
2490280	2495640	actually like tempted to go find like a $10 copy of Lego rock band just to import those
2495640	2501400	songs into my massive collection. I did. I bet you can find them really cheap use now
2501400	2508480	or not used with the code. Uh, new, new. Dude, they still make it, right? Yeah. I can probably
2508480	2512080	find it on Amazon or something. It's dropped in price too much. Uh, all right. I want to
2512080	2514720	talk about a game no one's talked about yet. No one get into gaming news. I know we've
2514720	2517700	been doing this for a very long time. There's been a lot of games this week. Uh, pinball
2517700	2524840	FX two came out on the Xbox live marketplace. It's free, which is awesome. And if you owned
2524840	2529800	pinball FX one, the game will go, Oh, Hey, since you were a loyal pinball FX one user,
2529800	2536000	I'm going to just import those tables right on into pinball FX two. Love it. Like, like
2536000	2539800	just a little thing like that just actually like made me go, that was like actually really
2539800	2544640	cool. Like they didn't really have to do that, but they did. And then, you know, you can
2544640	2548520	play demos of the other tables. Any download tables also come right in because I think
2548520	2552720	I downloaded a buccaneer. I either had paid a small amount and it was free for a time
2552720	2557880	or something. Oh yeah, it's fun. And that came right into, and just all the different
2557880	2562040	features that are in it now. Like you, supposedly it does stuff with the Xbox live vision camera,
2562040	2565960	which made me laugh. Cause uh, now that everything's pushing connect, it's kind of funny that the
2565960	2569640	vision camera's in there. I don't know if it uses either or I'm not interested in playing
2569640	2573120	pinball with a camera, but apparently it will take video of you when you're playing. I should
2573120	2581840	try selling back my vision camera to like $5. All right. Um, but yeah, I was, I was
2581840	2586720	just very happy that all the tables re-imported and they have a more robust demo system and
2586720	2590640	yeah, just, just, you can sense that the physics have been upgraded and the interface has been
2590640	2594400	upgraded and everything has gotten a little tweaked. Just, we've been talking about rock
2594400	2600100	band, right? Same type of thing. Like it's pinball FX is now like the rock band of pinball
2600100	2605360	and I am okay with that. I would be even better with that if them and uh, Midway and Williams
2605360	2607840	and all that, even though I know they're long gone, but like the people who are doing those
2607840	2613020	pinball collections could somehow like sleep together and bring some of those really classic
2613020	2620400	pinball tables into the pinball FX engine. That would be awesome. Also, I look at a game
2620400	2626840	like this and I go with game room being in the state that it's in right now, like I want
2626840	2632200	Zen studios to get game room. Like I want Microsoft to give that to Zen studios cause
2632200	2637280	they seem to know how to do this whole micro transaction game within a game thing. Like
2637280	2640320	I don't know what Microsoft has planned for game room long term. Now, if anything, they
2640320	2643380	might just sweep it under the rug. Like they've been doing a lot of stuff, but if they plan
2643380	2648060	on keeping that going, I would love to see it go over there. Even though I think that
2648060	2652960	studio probably has no interest in anything but pinball, but you never know. Huh? So that's
2652960	2658800	really it. Uh, that was it for my gaming week. I don't really have anything else to say on
2658800	2663120	that. So let's get into housekeeping tonight. Join our Facebook, facebook.com slash orange
2663120	2668160	launch radio. We're also on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R. I think we have a MySpace, but
2668160	2673320	who is MySpace anymore? Is anyone on MySpace? Any MySpace fans? Didn't think so. Let's get
2673320	2677920	into some gaming news. We'll start off tonight with Loki. We're only what, 50 minutes into
2677920	2681840	the show, finally getting to gaming news? I'm totally on MySpace. Just kidding. I'm
2681840	2687280	not on MySpace cause no one uses it. Uh, I think anyone who's on MySpace just never deleted
2687280	2693160	their profile two years ago. Exactly. No, um, actually some pretty interesting stuff
2693160	2702600	going on. Um, Gran Turismo 5. Yeah. It's supposed to be out this week, right? Right? No? Yes?
2702600	2709400	Um, it didn't end up coming out this week and it's been delayed again. And um, of course
2709400	2714400	they haven't really said when it's supposed to be coming out. Um, other than just a few
2714400	2720080	different comments based off of um, the producers of the game and what retailers are saying.
2720080	2729080	Uh, for example, the uh, creator, uh, Yamaguchi, or was it, uh, Yamauchi, basically was telling
2729080	2736080	uh, the website uh, um, Japolik, uh, that the discs were being stamped as we speak.
2736080	2741360	Which I can tell you right now is bullshit. That the game has not been, um, or has not
2741360	2748480	gone gold and I don't believe is being stamped right now. Um, also apparently retailers are
2748480	2755920	listing that the game is going to have a, uh, past Christmas release date. Um, some
2755920	2760240	of them are showing, you know, a 1-1 release date or December 31st. Which I can tell you
2760240	2765940	right now is just a temporary date. Um, the official word on what's going on with this
2765940	2771920	is actually, uh, they are shooting for a release before November, but they're not sure if they're
2771920	2775760	going to hit that mark. If not, it's going to be sometime early December. That's when
2775760	2780120	you can expect Gran Turismo 5 unless they screw something else up. Which case it will
2780120	2786640	probably be next year. So, that's what's going on with that. You just gotta wait longer.
2786640	2792360	The more this is going on, the more I'm kinda like forgetting about this game. Exactly.
2792360	2796200	You know what I mean? That's kinda sad because Gran Turismo's like a huge franchise and everything.
2796200	2799000	But the more this is going on, I'm just kinda like, oh, there's all this other stuff. Remember
2799000	2802640	when Gran Turismo 5 Prologue came out and it was supposed to be a taste of what the
2802640	2808760	game was like? And now it's not even close to what the game was like? That's funny. Remember
2808760	2815160	when they had, was it, Gran Turismo 5, like, what was it, it was like Concept or something
2815160	2822360	like that? It was the free download that was on, um, the Playstation Network. It was ridiculous.
2822360	2827600	Satellite Minded says in our chatroom at chat.artisanotraday.com, do Grand Theft, or, sorry, I was gonna say
2827600	2833560	Grand Theft. Gran Turismo 5 delays count as news anymore. I think in this case, yes, because
2833560	2839560	they're missing the holiday season, if this is all true, which is, you know, pretty damaging.
2839560	2843680	I mean, it is and it isn't. I think we've shown through this last year that games can
2843680	2849360	do very well, even if released after the holidays. Case in point, Mass Effect 2 came out, what,
2849360	2855280	like a week after the holidays. And it did fine. But still, to miss that holiday season
2855280	2859440	especially with such an epic, epic game, I think is newsworthy. When it's been one that
2859440	2865840	Sony's been hedging a lot of bets on. But maybe it's just me. Spazinator says, Gran
2865840	2872480	Turismo 5 is the new Duke Nukem forever. That would be sad. And that's funny, is that it's
2872480	2877000	actually supposed to be coming out relatively soon. Like, isn't it coming out like first
2877000	2882680	quarter next year soon? Yes. Wow. I know. I know. Blowing my mind. I may have to take
2882680	2887400	a day off work for that one. Really? That big a deal. I don't even think I'm taking
2887400	2894560	a day off for Cataclysm. All right. Anyhow, going to other Sony news. Did you know that
2894560	2900360	the Tester 2 started this week? Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. Yeah, that's right. I did and
2900360	2905660	don't care. The Tester 2, of course, you know, this is the sequel to the Tester 1, which
2905660	2911220	is Sony's original programming for PlayStation Network. And, you know, it's been getting
2911220	2915080	its share of crap. And, you know, even though I, even I myself am hazing the Tester 2 here
2915080	2920480	on the show, it's not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. It's just no better than
2920480	2928480	like an average bravo reality television show. But is that as far as Sony wants to go? Possibly
2928480	2932480	not if you were to believe PlayStation Network director Susan Fennico. They want to go all
2932480	2937000	the way. That's right. She wants to go all the way. Saying, quote, I hope five years
2937000	2946120	from now we'll be winning Emmys for quality shows. No. I'm sorry. No one wins Emmys for
2946120	2951720	reality shows. It starts with a dream. It starts with a dream, Loki. I look at what
2951720	2955820	HBO has done over several years, this being a quote, where they started just offering
2955820	2960720	movies and went into the original production business. By no means am I putting the Tester
2960720	2965240	with the Sopranos and what have you, but if you want to make yourself the go-to destination
2965240	2970240	for content, you need to provide content that people can't get anywhere else. We look at
2970240	2974760	original programming and the Tester as the foundation for building out something much
2974760	2980720	bigger. I will give them props to the fact that they are, you know, also a movie production
2980720	2988640	house. So they have the, you know, the resources. I just don't see the Tester as a good example
2988640	2993980	of what can be done with those resources. It all starts with a dream. I mean, because
2993980	2999160	honestly with the Tester, I mean, granted, if we knew a lot of, you know, big companies
2999160	3005400	that we could do wonderful little stunt events with, you know, and stuff, like the first
3005400	3011100	person driving or, you know, third person driving or whatever, you know, we could probably
3011100	3017000	pull something off like that on our own with no budget whatsoever. They should totally,
3017000	3020120	like, they should let- Oh wait, no, I'm sorry. That's, I'm thinking of a different game.
3020120	3024480	I'm actually thinking of the world's championship gaming show that's actually on there. No,
3024480	3027680	I haven't seen the Tester at all, actually, so I don't know what they do. But I'm sure
3027680	3032600	it's, you know, not high budget. They should let the PlayStation Network become the public
3032600	3036360	access of the gaming community and people should be able to put their own shows up on
3036360	3039600	there. Oh, like the new podcast. That would be awesome. That would be awesome. Spassinator
3039600	3043920	PSN in our chat room says, there's only one good thing about the Tester 2, Adrienne Curry.
3043920	3048680	Need I say more? Really? She's in that? She is a hot mess. Like, that might make it actually
3048680	3053200	worth watching. That bitch is a mess. Oh, they don't have house parks this year or something?
3053200	3058680	They have her instead? I think so. Interesting. Because that, oh man, she is, let's just say
3058680	3065280	she was very pro Prop 19. She was very sad, I'm sure. That didn't pass. Just saying. Satellite
3065280	3069440	Minded says, Sony will win an Emmy for PSN shows when GT5 comes out. Yeah, because I'm
3069440	3075320	sure now she won't be able to do pot. Yeah, that was the only thing stopping her. Oh yes,
3075320	3081920	ah, that no vote really stopped everyone. I'm sure California. Way to go. Anyhow, uh,
3081920	3086760	you know, you're right though, that Sony has the studio behind it to make this work if
3086760	3093400	they want to. It's just that this, I don't really see as the real motivator to get things
3093400	3098440	going, but you know, we'll see what happens. What Sony should do is take some of the pilots
3098440	3105480	that maybe don't work out very well or better yet, here's a great idea, Sony. Take shows
3105480	3110400	that get canceled before their prime. And if you want an example of this, just go to
3110400	3115080	Fox because Fox always loves to cancel things before their prime and get the rest of the
3115080	3121600	episodes and put them up on PSN. Especially like, can you imagine if something like PlayStation
3121600	3126120	store had been around when Firefly was on TV? Like hear me out. Like I know there's
3126120	3132520	Whedon nerds that listen to the show. So imagine like Fox cancels Firefly, but Sony is smart
3132520	3137160	enough to know, Oh, there was actually this really strong cult audience for the show.
3137160	3141160	Somebody's already paid to make this show. Let's just buy the rights to put them on PlayStation
3141160	3144860	network and have it be ad supported. And then that would just draw, you know, and then maybe
3144860	3149800	it finally finds its audience in this on demand network. Like that could be huge. Now I don't
3149800	3156680	think Firefly was a Sony studio show. I think, I don't know. Yeah, but, but anyway, take,
3156680	3161120	just take that idea and apply it to maybe a really good show that Sony might've had
3161120	3165520	or here's an idea since you've got, you know, you like doing television programming and
3165520	3170160	stuff like that. Make your own IPTV channels, you know, actually have some different channels
3170160	3174520	of content on there that are exclusive to the PlayStation network and say maybe you
3174520	3182600	have to pay a $5 a month fee to access this stuff. That would be kind of neat. Yeah. Oh,
3182600	3188920	so Hulu. No, not necessarily. That's an on demand type thing. I'm talking about actual
3188920	3193800	content that's, you know, like a live network where you can tune in at a certain time and
3193800	3199200	watch something not, you know, Oh, Hey, I want to watch old episodes of this and go.
3199200	3205360	All right. Well, we'll see what happens with Sony programming later on. Maybe they'll announce
3205360	3212040	an expansion at E3. Who knows? Uh, but I would expect that Xbox is going to announce a, um,
3212040	3216440	success for success for the one versus 100 first. Oh wait, they did. And I don't think
3216440	3219360	it came up anywhere on our show world tonight. Did you hear about this just quickly? I got
3219360	3223600	to throw this out there. There's a new game coming out for Xbox that is that whole one
3223600	3228980	versus 100 esque type of thing. The massively multiplayer game. Uh, it's a poker game, which
3228980	3236960	I'm kind of like sick of poker games. Yeah. Dan plays Texas. Too many of them. Does he
3236960	3242240	really? Yeah. I mean, there's an audience for it. It's an easy game to learn. It'll
3242240	3246720	have an audience. I'll try it once, but not interested unless it's strip poker. And even
3246720	3252560	then I probably wouldn't be connected. That's possible. Connect poker. Now you can connect
3252560	3259280	in a whole new way. Dark soccer. What do you have for us? Well, we have, uh, something
3259280	3265360	regarding Apple. They have, uh, filed a patent that looks like it's going to be an augmented
3265360	3273840	reality game. It has, uh, something on there for targeting and using a real world interactive
3273840	3278140	game environment. And yeah, from what it looks like on here, it's going to be so you can
3278140	3289120	shoot people. In the face. Yeah. It even, um, has a mention of a gun attachment for
3289120	3296260	it. Um, I really don't know what they're doing. I mean, it could be maybe laser tag or could
3296260	3301320	be that they're just filing it so that no one else does it. Or it could be, you know,
3301320	3306720	a money shot game. Sorry, I just can't help but think of that thing we played on the show
3306720	3311240	a couple of weeks ago from the onion. That was the shoot people in the face over and
3311240	3318360	over game. And then it was like cute furry animals too. Yeah. Yeah. This will be controversial
3318360	3324080	at all. If you can shoot your friends in the face, maybe it can be like ink blaster. Right,
3324080	3331840	right. Red ink. Yeah. Red ink. Um, they could also just be patenting this so no one else
3331840	3340120	can. That's what my thought was. Yeah. Anyhow, that's all I got to say on that. Um, so other
3340120	3345640	interesting things. Apparently with the new dashboard, and this is, you know, totally
3345640	3351320	not unexpected. Um, they are actually going to be implementing new features to try to
3351320	3361480	stop piracy. Um, unhackable. Yeah, about that. Let me guess, some mucky muck up there came
3361480	3366640	out and said that you can't pirate on this thing. It's, we have, we have made this hackproof.
3366640	3373240	I don't think anyone said anything about it, but basically they have, um, a new, uh, series
3373240	3379280	of checks that they do for disks, uh, which I guess hackers are referring to as AP 2.5.
3379280	3383880	I guess that work in conjunction with security sectors embedded in the disk. If the checks
3383880	3388780	come back negative, the player receives a dirty disk error and his or her console is
3388780	3395520	flagged for perma ban. Um, it says, uh, pirates though can hypothetically avoid these checks
3395520	3400880	by not updating to the new firmware. And though this will prevent them from playing on Xbox
3400880	3407980	live, which kind of defeats the purpose of avoiding the perma ban. Um, yes, apparently
3407980	3413440	if you know, well one, if you're burning a copy of the game anyways, you could just delete
3413440	3419160	the update on it. So that would, uh, you know, bypass that cause not all games that have
3419160	3427120	the new, uh, firmware attached with them actually require that firmware to run. Um, and also
3427120	3432360	if you have a J tag console, you can just play and delete the update anyways. And, um,
3432360	3436680	that way you can avoid actually, you know, having to update your system. Of course, well,
3436680	3441040	if you have a J tag, you can't update it anyways. Well look, Microsoft has a right to protect
3441040	3444960	their assets and I get that and everything, but are they bragging about it? Did they come
3444960	3451280	out and say? No. Digital Foundry did. Well then, you know, it's to be expected in this
3451280	3455520	case. I just, the only thing that gets me is when they come out and say, oh, well this
3455520	3460440	system, we've put measures in this to make this unhackable and it's going to do this
3460440	3465480	and this. That's just an open invitation for people to say, please hack me. But you know,
3465480	3470380	if Microsoft just quietly did this, that's how it should be done really. Well, here's
3470380	3475760	the thing too though. Um, it's not foolproof though, because apparently old Samsung and
3475760	3481280	Hitachi drives do not have that security check in their hardware. So it completely bypasses
3481280	3486040	it. So you know what people can do? They can spoof their drive with one of these older
3486040	3491040	drives, and then they can get past all those checks. And replacement drives are only about
3491040	3494480	20 bucks. Yeah, but that's a lot of work. And that's not a lot of work for someone that's
3494480	3498040	really determined. Well, yeah, but how many people are that determined? I don't know.
3498040	3502880	I've spoofed a drive before because I've messed up flashing a firmware on there. It's really
3502880	3512880	simple to do. Um, but yeah, I mean, you'd really have to want to play burn games. Interesting.
3512880	3517640	Well, you know, I'm sure we're going to continue to hear news like this as more of these firmware
3517640	3522080	updates come out. It's really no surprise that half the time new firmware updates. It's
3522080	3525680	always a back and forth. They'll win. They'll figure out a way around it and they'll come
3525680	3529720	out with something new, and they'll figure out a way around that, and so on and so forth.
3529720	3533240	Alright, well let's move on to something a little different, and this has to do with
3533240	3539080	the iPhone slash iTouch slash iPad, the iOS family of games. There's a brand new service
3539080	3545440	from Capcom out there. It's a free-to-play iPhone arcade app. It's called Capcom Arcade.
3545440	3550840	It is free, and you can play Street Fighter II, Commando, Ghouls and Ghosts in 1942. Ooh,
3550840	3556200	ah, but here's the catch. It's just like Game Room in the sense where you can get tokens
3556200	3562860	to play games for 99 cents, or you can pay three bucks for unlimited access. Or, here's
3562860	3568960	the best part, you get three free plays per day. So if you just want to download and play
3568960	3574840	three times a day, free! Yay! Go get it. What's the sobby from just changing data on your
3574840	3582120	phone? I have no idea. I'm not that desperate to play more Street Fighter II. I mean, I
3582120	3587160	played that game until my fingers were bleeding back when I was like 12. You know, I'll play
3587160	3593200	it once and I'll go, hee hee, this sure controls, like, ass on my iPhone, but it was fun to
3593200	3601940	try. That's really what it's gonna be. Let's not forget, they make terrible controllers.
3601940	3605840	That's the one thing that's really stopping iOS from moving on is the lack of something
3605840	3611780	tangible right now. Exactly. But hey, I'm all about free, even if it's just three times
3611780	3617480	a day. I'll get as much of that out as I can. But where's Quiz and Dragons? That's what
3617480	3624880	I'm waiting for. Hey, you gotta, you know, keep room for updates. Mm-hmm. Alright, moving
3624880	3627880	on, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? We have release dates coming up right after
3627880	3631640	this, and classic game of the week, not that far away. Well this sounds really cool, and
3631640	3638720	something I'm actually thinking about participating in is that Capcom's forum has these contest
3638720	3644760	rules. Basically until November 22nd, you can do your own artwork for Marvel vs. Capcom
3644760	3651640	3, and if it basically wins, then you get an Xbox 360, and a couple of Marvel vs. Capcom
3651640	3659820	3, and a framed print of your own work. Make sure it's not dirty. And your work gets to
3659820	3666600	actually be in the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 art book. That's pretty cool. I mean, I don't
3666600	3673080	think that my stuff is all that fantastic, but it'd still be fun to participate. I guess
3673080	3679480	if you have artistic talent, which won't be me. When they do the voice actor thing, then
3679480	3683080	I'll try, but for now. I'd see, I'd just probably end up drawing a picture of Deadpool in his
3683080	3688600	boxers eating Cheetos, or something. What kind of sick fetish are you into over there?
3688600	3692280	Because that's usually how you see them in the comic book. I see. She has a boxer Cheeto
3692280	3697680	fetish. That's what it is. Well good luck Dark Soccer if you choose to participate.
3697680	3702360	If not, you're lazy. Alright, let's move on to some release dates. Travel the world and
3702360	3709660	see what's coming out in a country near you. Yes, this week has a few releases coming out.
3709660	3715320	Some games I'm sure you've heard about coming out this week, including one. Some modern
3715320	3721280	warfare and military game called Call of Duty Black Ops will be coming out on a few systems.
3721280	3726400	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. There's a version for the Wii, but really isn't going
3726400	3737520	to play it. And DS. Yeah, I'm sure DS sells a lot of Call of Duty Black Ops. Other fun
3737520	3748920	things coming out this week of course. I know there's more Kinect games. Oh yay, more? Yes,
3748920	3760200	more. No, actually, let's see here. God, I hate the new site that they have here. Well,
3760200	3765840	you know you could always prep these things in advance. Of course not. Just saying. Let's
3765840	3770240	see, let's talk about other things that are not necessarily Kinect games, because there's
3770240	3776200	a lot of those too. We gotta mention all of them, because everybody wants to know. Chuck
3776200	3782160	E. Cheese's Playhouse, a crappy game for kids, and that's on Nintendo DS. Noah's Ark, also
3782160	3787960	on the Nintendo DS. Chuck E. Cheese's Game Room on Nintendo DS. Nickelodeon Fit on the
3787960	3792880	Wii, that's really for little kids. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, that's right, the
3792880	3797080	one that's Claymation that they have each year, they base the game off that. That's
3797080	3803440	on the Wii and DS. Family Feud, decades coming out on the Nintendo Wii. What the hell is
3803440	3809320	Family Feud Decades? Is that like where you get Richard Dawson from the 70s? No, no, no.
3809320	3812800	Ray Combs from the 80s? It's much simpler than that. You have families dressed up like
3812800	3819520	different cliches of decades. That is the cheapest cash-in I have ever heard in my life.
3819520	3828840	Cha-ching. Monster Jam Path of Destruction on the Wii, DS, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and
3828840	3833240	they actually do have bundles that include a steering wheel, even one for the Playstation
3833240	3838440	3, but not for the move. You'd be surprised to find out it's actually for the stupid DualShock
3838440	3846240	3, because I guess the game uses 6-axis steering. Just Dance Kids, this is also another game
3846240	3850560	for little kids. It's Just Dance with the wheels on the bus go round and round and other
3850560	3857760	things like music from The Wiggles and whatnot. Definitely not something that our age demographic
3857760	3863480	listeners would be interested in. Also, Karaoke Revolution Glee, they have a bundle coming
3863480	3872800	out on the Wii. This game gives me nightmares. Let's see here. Honda Fever, it's basically
3872800	3879560	just a repackage of another game that came out that sucked. Beyblade Metal Fusion, I
3879560	3883120	guess this is actually a series that's still on TV, but they have that game coming out
3883120	3890200	on the Nintendo DS and the Wii. Oh, and I guess Monster Jam Path of Destruction came
3890200	3896520	out on PSP as well. This has got to be the worst game I've ever seen. Reload Target Down
3896520	3902880	for the Nintendo Wii. It is a game where you test fire guns. That's right, it's a game.
3902880	3907800	You don't shoot people, you target shoot with guns. Well, that way it's safe for the whole
3907800	3912720	trashy family. Oh yeah, I'm sure. It's still rated team. Because it's guns! It's not even
3912720	3918120	worth it, just by Call of Duty. I mean, seriously. Style Lab Fashion Design on the Nintendo DS.
3918120	3922200	Hasbro Family Game Night, they're doing some bundles for that. One and two are bundled
3922200	3928720	together on the Wii. Challenge Me Brain Puzzles 2 on the Nintendo DS. Remington Super Slam
3928720	3937400	Hunting North America on the Wii. Okay, let's see here. Remington Super Slam Hunting Africa
3937400	3944760	on the Wii. My Sims Collection with both My Sims Racing and I believe just My Sims. Tom
3944760	3952000	Clancy's Hawks 2 on the Wii, finally coming out now. Rune Factory 3 of a fantasy Harvest
3952000	3958560	Moon on the Nintendo DS. Apparently they're doing an ESA game pack. This is something
3958560	3963680	that they do every year. Usually a certain game manufacturer will actually put out a
3963680	3972080	collection of stuff. This one comes with Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, Tomb Raider, and Mercenaries
3972080	3979840	2 for $29.99 and all the proceeds I believe go to charity for that to the ESA if you want
3979840	3987120	to support that. Some really old ass games. Sing Star Dance, a very terrible add-on to
3987120	3993920	the Sing Star series. That is on the Playstation 3. The fight lights out. Seriously, do not
3993920	3999160	buy this game. It was terrible. It's got horrible reviews. You really do not need this game.
3999160	4004460	The Sly Collection, that's coming out on Playstation 3. It's a recreation of, or I guess, HD versions
4004460	4011920	of the old Sly Cooper games, and the third one is actually in 3D as well. Ah, yes. Man,
4011920	4018360	there's a ton of crap coming out. Digging for Dinosaurs on Nintendo DS. Zuzu Pets has
4018360	4024080	some more games coming out. The Kung Zu on Nintendo DS. I'm just gonna skip past a bunch
4024080	4030600	of this crap. I guess Harvest Moon is being re-released on Nintendo DS. Really? Well,
4030600	4036520	same with, they're doing a lot of re-releases on stuff. Rune Factory 2 is coming out. They're
4036520	4040680	re-releasing that. I think there's probably a price drop. Same with the first one. Re-releasing
4040680	4046360	all that stuff. The new Xbox controller with that wonderful fixed D-pad is now coming out
4046360	4052860	this week for $65 if you really want to buy that. And then a few things one week from
4052860	4059220	today. Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini Land Mayhem coming out on Nintendo DS. And then also one
4059220	4066200	week from today will be the potential for a new Mario Paint U-Draw tablet with U-Draw
4066200	4069740	Studios will be coming out. And then of course the two games that go along with that. Dude's
4069740	4075400	Big Adventure and Pictionary. And of course that's that tablet thing that looked like
4075400	4081040	the Mario Paint type pen tablet thing. And then of course Pictionary is also on Nintendo
4081040	4087000	DS. And that's it. Finally, jeez. Sorry, there's a lot of crap coming out of this one. And
4087000	4090560	I fenced this on crap. Let's go to Japan and see what's coming out over there. On the Xbox
4090560	4096400	360, Forza Motorsport 3 on November 11th. This is the ultimate edition by the way. Mushihima
4096400	4102640	Sama Futari version 1.5 is the Platinum Collection. Why do you want this so bad? This is a shooter
4102640	4107200	game, isn't it? It is. And it's a really cool shooter. And there's also an iPhone version
4107200	4112960	adventure game coming out. Also Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2, Mafia 2, and Scared 2 Fallen
4112960	4117160	Angel. Also getting a price reduction. Those are all on the Xbox 360 this week. What did
4117160	4125840	I say? Scared. Oh, my bad. Yeah, Sacred 2. I like a game called Scared 2. Scared 2. PlayStation
4125840	4131160	3 has Biohazard 5 alternative edition. That would be Resident Evil 5 with the move. Dragon
4131160	4139200	Ball Raging Blast 2, Mafia 2, Scared 2, Fallen Angel, my bad. Shinsengoku Musou Online, Soton
4139200	4147000	Rambo comes out this week as well on the PlayStation 3. This is the online version of, why can
4147000	4152880	I, name is slipping my head, the one where you kill everything and smash the button.
4152880	4157360	There's like 7 of those game, Dynasty Warriors, is that it? Yeah. It's that. Oh, what was
4157360	4163240	the one? Oh, Dynasty Warriors Online. Yeah, it's that. Moving on to other systems on the
4163240	4169960	Nintendo Wii in Japan this week on the 11th. The 25th anniversary Mario game comes out
4169960	4173600	over there as well as see Nintendo Wii in some different colors. Something called the
4173600	4179000	Party Game Box 100, use your imagination. Wii Remote Plus controls in all sorts of different
4179000	4184680	colors. Black, blue, pink, red, white, Wii. Puyo Puyo 7 gets a price reduction. No one
4184680	4190640	cur. Jinsei Game, Happy Family gets released as well. Speaking of things that we don't
4190640	4197120	care about. Uh, PlayStation 2 gets one game this week called Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica
4197120	4201920	After School. I can only guess what this game is gonna be about. I'll give you a hint, there's
4201920	4207560	a girl in a school outfit on the cover. Porn? No, sadly it's not that, but it's probably
4207560	4212880	just another, like, you know, we're angsty, we're in school, da da da. Nintendo DS, Crafting
4212880	4217360	Mama comes out this week. Puyo Puyo 7 gets a price reduction there as well. Tamagotchi!
4217360	4223360	Bet you thought those games were dead, yep. Tamagotchi no Narikiri Challenge comes out
4223360	4229920	as well. That's on the Nintendo DS this week. And lastly going to the Sony PSP, God of War
4229920	4235480	Goes to Sparta gets its Japanese release this week. Tactics Ogre, Unmei no Wa gets a release
4235480	4241720	this week. I know that'll be a game that has some people excited. And, uh, Karu Batake
4241720	4247480	de Sukamete Portable comes out this week. I originally had read that as Karu Bekake,
4247480	4255120	but it actually is not that, although it looks like this game stars plenty of... Bekake?
4255120	4259200	People that you'd probably want to see in a bukake porn. I'm just kidding, they're kids,
4259200	4262640	that's gross. Alright. What's wrong with you? How about something else? What's wrong with
4262640	4269520	you? How about it? Well in the UK we have on the 9th Call of Duty Black Ops, then we
4269520	4277240	have on the 10th Dance Central, Dance Paradise, Dance Evolution, Dance Masters, Fighters Uncaged,
4277240	4283160	Game Party in Motion, the Kinect, Kinect Adventures, Kinect Joyride, Kinect Sports, Kinectimals,
4283160	4290280	Motion Sports, Kinect Adventures, Your Shape Fitness Evolved, and also Raving Ravage, Travel
4290280	4300040	in Time, and Sonic Colors, Tom Clancy's Hawks 2. That's it. That's all I'm gonna say anyway.
4300040	4304360	See I like how you filter the crap out. Well just cause I go to a... I'm sorry I don't
4304360	4310280	understand what you're talking about. I'm just messing with you. Alright, uh, let's
4310280	4315140	move on. A couple more stories in the Classic Game of the Week. You want me to filter all
4315140	4319920	the crap out? I'll just mention one game the next time. Stop. Sorry, this week only comes
4319920	4325480	out. We're gonna filter all the crap. It is Chuck E. Cheese as the only game coming this
4325480	4333120	week. Now, Xbox Live Indie Games has disappeared off the main marketplace menu and you actually
4333120	4338120	have to dig for it now. It's in Specialty Shops. By the way, it's not that hard to find
4338120	4344000	you guys. I know. It is a couple menus deep, but it's not like impossible to find. But
4344000	4348580	I understand why people are pissed. Sorry, I'll shut up. Yeah, so it is now under Specialty
4348580	4353960	Shops. Of course, Avatar Marketplace being the first spot on there, but Indie Games is
4353960	4361360	a close second. And, of course, Xbox Live Indie Game creators are bummed over the fact
4361360	4369920	that the menu has been slightly hidden, you know, if you will. And, uh, I don't know.
4369920	4377960	It's just, uh, they kind of feel like they've been brushed off, I guess. I don't think it's
4377960	4384720	that big a deal, to be honest. You know, don't they still let you use web links to, like,
4384720	4388840	link directly to items in the store? That's really how you're gonna have to start selling
4388840	4392340	games, I think, is really kind of using the web as a presence. And click here to download
4392340	4397600	to your Xbox now. It is kind of a shame, and I'm really surprised Microsoft hasn't gone
4397600	4403640	here yet, that they haven't tried to make something like iTunes on your PC that would
4403640	4411080	be automatically to download to your Xbox. Like, imagine a whole integration with Windows
4411080	4414060	Media Center, since that's, you know, where Microsoft, you know, obviously they can't
4414060	4418200	make iTunes, but they're kind of like competitors to Windows Media Player. Imagine if they had
4418200	4421900	something like Windows Media Player with a store in it, where it wasn't just the music
4421900	4426700	and movies, but things that you could download to your Xbox. Or maybe, like, when you download
4426700	4432640	a movie, it would download to your PC and your Xbox. But, within that, they could do,
4432640	4436700	like, this whole indie games thing, kind of like iTunes does. Like, I don't know, I could
4436700	4444060	kind of see that being kind of neat. But, at the same time, maybe it's too much work.
4444060	4447080	Maybe they're trying to sell this whole Kinect thing. And they haven't opened up Kinect to
4447080	4450760	indie developers yet, have they? Probably won't for a long time.
4450760	4457160	Um, I don't remember if they have or not. I think maybe Xbox Live Arcade, but not, um,
4457160	4458880	I don't know.
4458880	4462760	Ross Steel, UT is in our chat room. Is there really? Ross Steel, UT, I haven't seen him
4462760	4466400	in, like, two years. The indie games aren't any less easy to find than they were before.
4466400	4467760	They're just butthurt.
4467760	4474760	Well, yeah, I mean, I didn't find them particularly hard to find. And I think, again, if you sell
4474760	4479080	yourself on the web, you'll be fine. I can understand, though, where the developers are
4479080	4483760	feeling a little bit unloved. But keep in mind, there's a lot of things at Microsoft
4483760	4487440	right now being unloved. Game Room's another one. Everything's all about the Kinect.
4487440	4491400	Kinect, Kinect, Kinect, Kinect. Maybe after the holidays, they can focus on that other
4491400	4500820	stuff again, but we'll see. Although I somehow, uh, wouldn't be holding my breath.
4500820	4505640	Something you know is inevitable, though, and is going to happen, is a Bejeweled 3.
4505640	4508920	That's right, Bejeweled 1 and Bejeweled 2 are some of the biggest freaking games ever
4508920	4512560	made. Bejeweled 3 is coming out on December 7th.
4512560	4514040	And my wife didn't care.
4514040	4515040	What?
4515040	4516040	She's like...
4516040	4517040	I thought Bejeweled was the only game she plays.
4517040	4520320	What were they going to add to it? I'm like, well, they have this, like, new poker mode
4520320	4521880	thing. She's like, that's dumb.
4521880	4527240	Well, wait until she tries. There are also, just so you know, new Quest and Zen modes
4527240	4532400	are coming to the game, unlockable secret game variants, and there's also supposed to
4532400	4537800	be smoother gameplay and new music and sound. Twenty dollars if you want to get it through
4537800	4543520	PopCap.com, but I bet you'll have to wait not even six months and it'll be out on iPhone
4543520	4549320	and Xbox Live and PlayStation Network and pretty much anything with a controller or
4549320	4550320	touch screen.
4550320	4552100	We'll have Bejeweled 3.
4552100	4557120	If Bejeweled 3 isn't cutting it for you, there's plenty of other Bejeweled stuff to come, including
4557120	4562200	Bejeweled Blitz Live. That's right, Bejeweled Blitz Live.
4562200	4567260	It might be on the PC, but they're saying that the classification says it's an Xbox
4567260	4571340	360 title. So who knows? Maybe it will show up on both.
4571340	4577460	Maybe it's something where now you'll be able to intermix the Xbox with the Facebook game.
4577460	4579880	Could be interesting.
4579880	4583880	By the way, Zuma Blitz is supposed to be coming out very soon as well, too. I think that's
4583880	4588720	in beta right now. So lots of new games coming out of Pop Crack.
4588720	4593440	What about Plants vs. Zombie Blitz? I guess I shouldn't hold my breath on that one.
4593440	4600560	Hey, it's the time of the show where we take a stroll down memory lane and allow Dark Sakura
4600560	4604440	to take the reins for a little bit. Oh, we must be crazy.
4604440	4609440	As she says, hey, this is a classic video game that you ungrateful children need to
4609440	4614120	go back and show a little of. Forget these K'Nex with their fancy infrared lasers and
4614120	4618200	the move with their flashing little ice cream cone light thingies.
4618200	4620700	These are games you can play in your underwear.
4620700	4626080	That's right. These are games you can play with no pants on and you'll like it.
4626080	4630000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4630000	4637000	The classic game of the week is Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Superheroes.
4637880	4642640	Because I got a big excited girl boner for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 today.
4642640	4644920	A bit of Lady Wood? Yes.
4644920	4648920	So we have to start off with the characters from the game.
4648920	4653920	This is my favorite movie in the game, for the record.
4653920	4660920	So, yes, the game is the fifth of the Marvel Comics licensed fighting games.
4663880	4669200	This one, actually, instead of being just an X-Men vs. or Marvel Superheroes vs. Street
4669200	4675200	Fighter, this goes all over the place. And you have to basically get all of these
4675200	4681200	people against Onslaught, who I felt was actually kind of a retarded character in the comics
4681200	4688200	but that's just me. So, moving forward, we have this one is where
4689560	4694240	you actually have a random assist character that you start off before the match instead
4694240	4697920	of bringing one of your teammates in, which I think they've gotten rid of for Marvel vs.
4697920	4703920	Capcom 3. And then, you know, there were also ways that
4703920	4707520	you could select who your little bonus person was.
4707520	4712520	And then, you also had duo team attacks. And this music is awesome, too.
4712520	4719520	It's the theme of the Strider family. He's not in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so far, but
4721520	4723240	this one. Yet.
4723240	4725320	So far, I said so far. I thought he was.
4725320	4729520	I was like, why not? But, no, not yet.
4729520	4736520	So anyway, the different characters in this one is you had Spider-Man, Captain America,
4737840	4742680	Hulk, Wolverine, Venom, Gambit, War Machine, Gold War Machine, Red Venom, Orange Hulk,
4742680	4749680	and Onslaught on the Marvel side. And on Capcom, you had Ryu, Chun-Li, Zangief,
4750480	4757080	Mega Man, Jin, Morrigan, Strider Hiryu, Captain Commando, Roll, you should play Roll's music
4757080	4760880	now. Lilith, or Shadow Lady.
4760880	4767880	I love Roll had singy-songy music. Yeah, she had singy music.
4776760	4782840	As far as your special partners, you got Unknown Soldier, Luance, and Siva, Saki Omakane, Piran
4782840	4789840	Fur, Psylocke, Michelle Hart, Iceman, Arthur, Tonpu, Juggernaut, Devilot, Thor, Magneto,
4789840	4796840	US Agent, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Anita, Jubilee, Rogue, Shadow, and Sentinel.
4797840	4801840	It at least gave the nods over to Tonpu. That was just cool. I laughed.
4801840	4808840	At any rate, there is a perfect version that came out on Dreamcast in 1999, and it had
4808840	4814840	cross fever modes so you could have four players play simultaneously. There was a version that
4814840	4819840	came out on the Playstation, which was the EX edition in Japan, but it didn't have the
4819840	4826840	tag team gameplay, and it didn't have the secondary characters, except just for assists.
4828600	4833840	But it did have the crossover, you could play a tag team with identical teams, which was
4833840	4840840	kind of stupid. But it did allow you to play as onslaught, and if you beat the game with
4844840	4849840	Mega Man or something. And yeah, the soundtrack came out, which I've got the soundtrack, and
4849840	4855840	it is amazing. And it was great, and it opened the door for all this other funness.
4855840	4863840	Of course, Dan got me hooked on playing with Strider Neo. This is other good music.
4869840	4870840	Everyone should recognize that.
4870840	4878840	Yep, the theme of Mega Man. It was a lot of fun. It's a great game. Definitely one worth
4878840	4883840	having on the Dreamcast, because it was perfect. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is really good. I'm looking
4883840	4888840	forward to Marvel vs. Capcom 3, but I had to start it with somewhere, and I think this
4888840	4890840	is a good place to do it.
4890840	4892840	It's as good of a place as any.
4892840	4894840	Yep, so that's it. That's your classic game of the week.
4894840	4901840	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Marvel vs. Capcom 1. Back before
4901840	4908840	there was all these other sequels, and now this new fancy one, although I gotta say,
4908840	4914840	the videos I was looking at online for the new one, and even seeing it at E3, although
4914840	4918840	it looks like it's come a long way, just even in the videos I've been seeing online.
4918840	4921840	Pretty awesome, gotta say. Looking forward to it.
4921840	4925840	Alright, we're gonna take a break. We'll be right back though, guys. Stay tuned. We have
4925840	4929840	plenty more show to come. We got our rapid fire news, which there's a lot since we have
4929840	4932840	to make up for last week. We're also gonna talk a little more about that whole Kinect
4932840	4935840	hacking stuff. We have another story on that coming up in a minute. We're gonna talk about
4935840	4941840	Fable 3 and Saints Row as well in the Xbox Live Arcade. So don't go anywhere, guys.
4941840	4945840	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4945840	4951840	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. We are taping the 388th episode of
4951840	4957840	our show live on this November the 7th of 2010. We've been talking a little bit in
4957840	4962840	Part A tonight about the new Kinect obviously is out, and we all had a chance to get our
4962840	4965840	hands on it, which is weird because I still have yet to really play PlayStation Move
4965840	4970840	outside of E3. But, Loki, you've gotten a chance to get your hands on both at this point
4970840	4975840	now. What do you think both are gonna offer us in a year's time?
4975840	4980840	The move, I think it's gonna pretty much be pretty much what you see right now with
4980840	4984840	the Nintendo Wii. The only difference being that since you have the camera in there,
4984840	4988840	they can do some of the augmented reality stuff, which is actually pretty cool with it.
4988840	4997840	I don't think it's really that different. They have more of a setup now where they're
4997840	5001840	gonna use it with more of their hardcore games, I guess, because Killzone 3 is already
5001840	5006840	gonna have that. SOCOM 4, they've got support for it. So it'll be interesting to see
5006840	5011840	how they implement that stuff or if it's even gonna be necessary or if you're gonna
5011840	5016840	be able to play as well with it. And then, of course, the Kinect. It's hard to say
5016840	5021840	how that's gonna really... I think there's a lot more potential with the Kinect because
5021840	5026840	they can pretty much do whatever they want with no controller gaming, but then they
5026840	5031840	can also, if they wanted to, and they've said it before, they're like, you know we
5031840	5036840	can have this so that it works with you playing not using the controller, right?
5036840	5041840	The complaint is, oh, there's no buttons and stuff. It's like, well, who says that
5041840	5048840	I can't do that or put out another controller later or whatever. I think there's a lot
5048840	5053840	more creative freedom with the Kinect than there is with the Move.
5053840	5061840	What do you think this is going to do anyway about the possible Xbox 720, the PlayStation 4,
5061840	5063840	the Wii 2, and obviously all these names are hypothetical.
5063840	5067840	I don't know, but if you notice, and I'm not sure if this is necessarily because
5067840	5071840	Microsoft is spending more money on advertising, because they are spending a lot of money
5071840	5075840	on advertising, but have you noticed with the whole Kinect stuff, there's been a lot
5075840	5081840	bigger of a splash with the Kinect stuff as far as all the talk shows and stuff like that.
5081840	5082840	Oh, absolutely.
5082840	5084840	Then there was the Move. The Move just came out and like...
5084840	5085840	It's here, guys.
5085840	5086840	It's here.
5086840	5090840	They had commercials. That's mostly of what you've seen for the Move and targeted
5090840	5094840	commercials during things like South Park. You'd always see a commercial for the Move.
5094840	5098840	You know, things of that sort. But yeah, definitely the Kinect is definitely trying to go
5098840	5106840	that Nintendo route of being on Ellen, being on the News, doing the whole Times Square
5106840	5110840	thing that they did. Gonna be very interesting.
5110840	5113840	Of course, Nintendo gets to go through this whole hub-a-loo again with the 3DS,
5113840	5117840	because that's going to be another big thing that, you know, they'll parade that out on
5117840	5121840	the Ellen show, too, and she'll go like, wow, it's like I could really see 3D, guys.
5121840	5126840	You know, and that whole thing. Some corny joke. Ooh, let's dance. You know.
5126840	5127840	Yeah.
5127840	5130840	That'll be what happens. So...
5130840	5134840	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
5134840	5137840	ActDeaf says, I think the next Wii will be a Super Wii.
5137840	5142840	Certainly a possibility. I mean, that might be a silly idea, but, you know, the Wii has
5142840	5146840	that recognition, just like Nintendo had back in the day as a system.
5146840	5151840	And then there was the Super NES. You know, that whole Wii HD everyone likes to theorize about it.
5151840	5155840	And Frisbee follows that up with, and then the Wii 64.
5155840	5159840	RasteelUT says, the Kinect is more novel than the Move. Let's be real.
5159840	5160840	You agree?
5160840	5163840	I think so. And the other thing, like I've said that...
5163840	5168840	Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I think it's more something we haven't seen before.
5168840	5172840	I mean, it is and it isn't. It feels like more of an evolution than the Move does.
5172840	5178840	Although, the technology behind the Move sounds pretty cool compared to what we've seen on the Wii.
5178840	5180840	We just don't see a lot of that in motion yet.
5180840	5184840	But this whole augmented reality and all that stuff you talk about makes me very excited.
5184840	5185840	The potential.
5185840	5195840	And that's the other thing too. The augmented reality stuff is possible with, you know, the Kinect.
5195840	5197840	I mean, who's to say? Because it can track your body.
5197840	5203840	Who's to say you can't, I don't know, even just have a game come out and have something as simple as
5203840	5206840	you hold up a piece of cardboard and there you go.
5206840	5209840	I mean, it just has to have something like a target for it.
5209840	5216840	And it basically uses the sensors that are in the Move controller and the orb to track that.
5216840	5221840	So, there's potential they could do all the same stuff.
5221840	5227840	And, you know, it has a good, you know, it can track you really well as we saw with, you know,
5227840	5233840	Dance Masters where it can do a literal, almost like a green screen of myself while I'm playing the game.
5233840	5238840	Not that I really want to see that because that's very, I feel like an idiot already.
5238840	5244840	And looking at myself playing the game, it's just like, why are you doing this?
5244840	5249840	Let me ask Jamie here for a minute. I don't mean to take you away from our lovely chatters.
5249840	5251840	We have a chat room at chat.orangetotraday.com.
5251840	5257840	But I know you don't get as into the new stuff, I think, as you have the classics.
5257840	5260840	You definitely, the most room in your heart is for the classic games.
5260840	5265840	What do you think about this new, I mean, certainly this is technology we never really saw before in the classic gaming world.
5265840	5272840	What do you think about the Kinect and the Move and all this and its potential impact on gaming?
5272840	5275840	I think the Move looks like a sex toy, so I'm completely not interested.
5275840	5286840	The Kinect I like. I really do. I think that it combines everything that they were trying to do with the Move and with the iToy.
5286840	5294840	Except it does it right. And it definitely gives you more of that virtual environment feel to your games.
5294840	5300840	That, I think, is great. I think that I can see it going two ways.
5300840	5305840	I can think we're going to get more and more and more like that and it'll be great. Or it will wear off after a while.
5305840	5310840	The novelty will wear off and people want to sit back on their couches with their, you know, controllers in their hands.
5310840	5317840	I like half agree with Dark Sakura. I kind of, the Kinect, there's some things about it that strike me as gimmicky too.
5317840	5320840	I mean, and I think it's that we haven't really seen its full potential yet.
5320840	5323840	Whereas at least Sony's kind of like throwing these things out there.
5323840	5330840	Like, I don't write off the Move quite as fast, but I will say right now, there's nothing I really want on the Move.
5330840	5334840	There's nothing the Move is doing for me and the type of games I like right now.
5334840	5340840	Well, there's a lot of possibilities for things they can do. Remember the whole head tracking demo that we saw with the Wii?
5340840	5345840	Where they have the guy wearing the Wii Remote? You can do that with the Kinect because it tracks your head.
5345840	5349840	So they can do that kind of stuff for like first person cheers. That's what I was saying.
5349840	5355840	That it's not necessarily, you don't have to have a game where you're just moving around like crazy.
5355840	5359840	They can just have it where they track your head. You're doing all your movements and stuff on the controller.
5359840	5365840	And you can still be slightly more immersed in the game and it can be an optional feature, which is kind of cool.
5365840	5367840	You can bring the mocap games home.
5367840	5368840	Yeah.
5368840	5371840	I'm really interested to see what next year's E3 is going to be.
5371840	5375840	Because at next year's E3, all of this is going to be the norm.
5375840	5381840	The 3DS is going to be out by next E3. You know, and all the rumors about the March release date or what have you.
5381840	5382840	It'll be March.
5382840	5384840	It'll be out before June. That's a given.
5384840	5387840	All of this stuff is now going to be the norm at next E3.
5387840	5391840	Move is now out. Kinect is now out. 3DS is now out.
5391840	5397840	And it's going to be really interesting because the next E3 is now going to be all about, okay, now what are you going to do with this?
5397840	5401840	Now that it's out. What have you come up with in the past year for how to use this technology?
5401840	5407840	It's going to be a very interesting show. I'm really excited about it. Even though it's like, what, nine months away?
5407840	5409840	I want to go this year.
5409840	5412840	Yeah. Hopefully we can make it all work for us.
5412840	5413840	Alright.
5413840	5423840	But, you know, I was just thinking, if you put both in front of me and said pick which one you want for free, I'd grab the Kinect.
5423840	5430840	I think me too, but only because it goes back to the rule of the system is only as good as the games that are on it.
5430840	5436840	And I wouldn't write the move off yet because a year from now we might be looking at the opposite.
5436840	5439840	Like, kind of like, that's just kind of what I see.
5439840	5444840	Is that I'm not sure I really see where Kinect is going, but maybe I'll be proven wrong at the next E3.
5444840	5454840	I think, if anything, if the whole point of releasing these new motion systems were to capture the new audience that they're looking for, the more casual audience,
5454840	5456840	I think the Kinect has done a better job of that.
5456840	5458840	Or at least it seems like it.
5458840	5460840	I don't think a lot of people care.
5460840	5465840	And that's too bad, because it's not a bad piece of hardware.
5465840	5468840	It's just it's not too different than what's already being done with the Wii.
5468840	5476840	It's just slightly better, and yeah, granted the hardware is better, so you can do better looking games, but it's not completely different.
5476840	5481840	Whereas I would say the Kinect is completely different than what they're doing with the Wii and the PlayStation 3.
5481840	5483840	It is separate.
5483840	5490840	Well I think one thing to consider as far as new hardware goes, I don't think it came up anywhere else in our show roll, but something that's been coming up.
5490840	5497840	This was a lot the week we were out, but were those rumors of the PSP phone, and some of the screenshots that showed up and all that.
5497840	5501840	So if this new PSP evolution is going to be shown at E3, could be interesting.
5501840	5508840	But I don't think it's going to be anything outside of this whole motion gaming stuff and what we're talking about here.
5508840	5509840	But we'll see.
5509840	5515840	Anyhow, let's move on into some rapid fire news and some of the quick stories we have for you now.
5515840	5519840	We have a lot since we had a week off, so Loki, we're going to start with you for the quick news.
5519840	5520840	Yes.
5520840	5523840	Oh sorry, Twitter topics. Get them in quick. You have about two more minutes.
5523840	5527840	Yes. So anyways, some interesting stuff going on.
5527840	5534840	Of course, we were talking a little bit about Dance Central and Harmonix being the ones that like to support download content.
5534840	5538840	They had some download content day one, whether you like that or not.
5538840	5545840	New songs that are coming out for Dance Central are going to run you 299 or 240 Microsoft points each.
5545840	5555840	The first three songs that they had available, Neo's Because of You, Lady Sovereign's I've Got You Dancing, and Sean Paul's Temperature.
5555840	5560840	And I guess those are all available now, and hopefully we'll see some more download content next week.
5560840	5572840	And let's see here. It didn't really say if the same moves are in there or if they're recycled or whatever, but I think it's kind of neat.
5572840	5580840	I really wish that the game had like a kind of a routine editor because they could easily do that with the flash cards and stuff they have on there.
5580840	5583840	Can anyone say the sequel?
5583840	5584840	Yeah.
5584840	5591840	Of course, Black Friday is not too far away, and with Black Friday, of course, the ads will leak out.
5591840	5597840	The first one to leak out with gaming related information, of course, would be from Sears.
5597840	5604840	And they had some new bundles and stuff for the holidays and some new interesting colors for different things.
5604840	5611840	For example, the limited edition red and green DSI bundles for $150, which include Mario Party DS.
5611840	5622840	They've got a 160GB PlayStation 3 bundle for $300, which includes Uncharted 2 and a Blu-ray of the new movie Karate Kid.
5622840	5623840	PSP...
5623840	5625840	What a deal.
5625840	5629840	The PSP 3000? Well, I think those two games are free.
5629840	5633840	No, just the whole Karate Kid Blu-ray and...
5633840	5635840	It's not a bad movie. I liked it.
5635840	5639840	I just refuse to see it. I'm being stuck up for no reason.
5639840	5641840	It was good, okay?
5641840	5649840	The PSP 3000, a bundle for $130, which includes LittleBigPlanet and UMD of the Karate Kid.
5649840	5654840	4GB Xbox 360 bundle for $200, which includes Halo Reach.
5654840	5657840	That's not bad.
5657840	5661840	They had $10 off of a standard, I guess, Wii bundle.
5661840	5670840	Also, they're going to be doing discounts on different games like Medal of Honor, Fable 3, Halo Reach.
5670840	5675840	All will be available for $40, which is pretty awesome.
5675840	5677840	Actually, this is kind of cool.
5677840	5682840	One of the games that's being marked down to $40, which will be just coming out around that time,
5682840	5684840	Need for Speed Hot Pursuit.
5684840	5690840	If you're interested in that game, which you should be because it's by Criterion and they do really awesome racing games,
5690840	5693840	you should definitely check it out.
5693840	5699840	I'm just saying, Loki, that of the Smith Kids, I think Willow is more talented because she whips her hair back and forth.
5699840	5702840	I don't know. The movie was not bad. I liked it.
5702840	5705840	Whatever you say. Isn't it the Kung Fu Kid?
5705840	5708840	Yes, it is the Kung Fu Kid.
5708840	5710840	Just saying.
5710840	5713840	They think we're dumb, so whatever.
5713840	5721840	Then, of course, with that, there's some new Xbox demos that came out on the marketplace this week.
5721840	5725840	Rock Band 3, which is pretty awesome, so you can check out a few songs from that.
5725840	5733840	Apache Air Assault, which is a helicopter attack game that's coming out on the 360 and PS3 in, I believe, next week or so.
5733840	5741840	Then, the most retarded addition to that would be Joyride, which, if you have the Kinect,
5741840	5747840	you'll realize that there is already a demo for Joyride on the disc of Kinect Adventures.
5747840	5754840	Why you would need to download an additional demo is beyond me, but have at it, I guess.
5754840	5758840	Definitely check out those demos if you haven't yet.
5758840	5765840	Dance Central, Joyride, Your Shape Fitness, and I believe that was it on there.
5765840	5771840	But, hey, three games you can check out for free, because I didn't notice that right away, and it said,
5771840	5776840	Other Kinect games? What's that? I'm like, oh, there's demos on here! Awesome!
5776840	5779840	Oh my gosh!
5779840	5782840	So, yeah, check that out.
5782840	5790840	And then, finally, I don't know, this is kind of ridiculous, but apparently with the Wii version of the Michael Jackson,
5790840	5798840	the experience game, you're gonna get the jewel-studded white glove to play the game with,
5798840	5802840	I guess, so that you can feel more like Michael Jackson.
5802840	5806840	Is it possible to think something is lame and yet totally awesome at the same time?
5806840	5810840	Like, this is totally awesomely lame.
5810840	5817840	Like, it's so bad, it's good. It's bad, it's bad, it's really, really bad.
5817840	5822840	You know it.
5822840	5827840	Oh, what I would pay to see Loki modeling one of these Michael Jackson gloves.
5827840	5830840	I may have to get the game when it comes out for the Kinect.
5830840	5833840	You know, I gotta say, it actually looks kind of awesome.
5833840	5838840	Like, let's face it, Michael Jackson had some badass songs, and you know there's gonna be good dances.
5838840	5843840	It's just dance with Michael Jackson songs, and with optional karaoke.
5843840	5847840	I don't give a shit about the optional karaoke, but I think that would be awesome.
5847840	5851840	I fucking love Michael Jackson's stuff. I don't care what people say that he did or did not do.
5851840	5853840	He was an awesome music artist.
5853840	5857840	I'm with you. If you just ignore all the other stuff.
5857840	5863840	And he has some new songs coming out apparently that there are rumors saying that they're so sound like doing some of them, but who gives a fuck?
5863840	5868840	Okay, everything that's been going on with like Tupac and Biggie when they were, you know, gone before their time,
5868840	5872840	and yet it seems like Tupac is still releasing a new album every other year from some shit they dig up,
5872840	5876840	expect it to be even worse with Michael Jackson.
5876840	5885840	Like, there will be a new album every year for as long as you're alive, and then there will soon be the rumors about he never really died.
5885840	5890840	They faked the death, and the body that came out of the house wasn't really him, and all this stuff.
5890840	5896840	And, you know, he did it to escape his personal problems, even though his kids were up there on stage crying.
5896840	5900840	And two more songs apparently have been announced for the game.
5900840	5908840	One of which is my wife's absolute favorite Michael Jackson song, one I kind of like, Speed Demon, and Dirty Diana.
5908840	5912840	Her absolute favorite song.
5912840	5914840	That's one of my favorites too.
5914840	5917840	You know what? My favorite actually isn't one of his dancey ones.
5917840	5919840	Uh, Man in the Mirror?
5919840	5921840	Well, she's out of my life.
5921840	5924840	Interesting.
5924840	5932840	Anyhow, we need to have a whole Michael Jackson the game launch party, but I just don't think everyone else would be as into it.
5932840	5934840	I just don't want to get in on the weed.
5934840	5938840	I think the generation after us too, which makes up a lot of our listeners.
5938840	5941840	They have terrible taste in music, okay?
5941840	5947840	They weren't around when it was about Michael Jackson on MTV, you know what I mean?
5947840	5951840	Like, we literally grew up with him, you know?
5951840	5953840	It's just different.
5953840	5956840	I remember when Thriller was on every hour.
5956840	5958840	Well, he and my mom were the same age.
5958840	5959840	Oh wow.
5959840	5967840	So, you know, I went through all of, you know, her old stuff and, you know, I grew up with the whole thing.
5967840	5971840	Alright, anyhow, let's move on and talk about other gaming news.
5971840	5975840	You Don't Know Jack, oh god, I love this game and I'm so excited it's making a comeback.
5975840	5979840	Because they did kind of burn that series into the ground.
5979840	5983840	Like, there was all these You Don't Know Jack games back in the day, like You Don't Know Jack the Ride and all this stuff.
5983840	6009840	Those are actually kind of cool.
