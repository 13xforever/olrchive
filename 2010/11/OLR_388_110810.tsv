14563	15485	and I November 7th, 2010.
15725	25278	The new Xbox Kinect dashboard is designed to thwart pirates, Capcom brings retro arcade to the i-family, and as Microsoft swept indie games under the rug,
32383	32683	DarkSakura.com
50663	53825	It's Knights of the Old Sorority, I was telling you, or whatever this is.
54105	59087	It's Knights of the Crystals on Facebook, but it's just sorority life with Final Fantasy characters.
59427	61208	Yeah, I'm going to stop playing this now.
61688	62669	Oh, you're no fun at all.
62909	64090	I'll play it after the show.
64150	65130	I'm being responsible.
65190	67011	Yes, you should concentrate on the show.
67031	67591	What do I save?
67611	68352	There'll be plenty of time.
68372	68972	You just close it.
69192	69832	It saves as you go.
71113	72454	The internet is a modern miracle.
72794	74815	Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
75055	75535	Hello.
75915	76656	How are you doing, Loki?
76936	77636	I'm doing fine.
77676	78977	Did you have a good week off, everybody?
79477	80518	Yeah, that's fun.
80838	81599	I didn't have a week off.
81879	82539	Why, what'd you do?
82940	83880	Recorded another podcast.
83980	85181	Oh yeah, you had the other show.
85281	89685	Hey, hey, I started a new show too, so you're not the only one that gets to plug a show now.
90005	90325	Ha!
90705	91166	Guess what?
91326	91526	What?
91586	92827	We still have a thing to do.
93087	97991	Actually, we only taped a pilot, so we're not really a show yet, because I don't have a place to host it.
98011	98611	Is it a pilot light?
98971	101253	Yeah, it just means, is the show going to work or not?
101273	102234	Over the Frankenstein place.
102814	104076	Anyway, I'll get into that in a minute.
104096	105758	We'll talk about other side projects in a moment.
106338	119014	I do want to introduce, of course, as always, our fourth guest, always here with us, the chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, live on this Sunday evening as we tape at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
119354	121597	Every Sunday night is when we tape Orange Lounge Radio.
122170	127534	Anyhow, right after the Bobby Blackwell show, of course, I've got to plug Bobby because he's always been there.
127855	132138	He calls himself the opening act, but I don't see it as a lesser billing.
132158	135961	He's a smart guy, knows a lot about gaming, so tune into his show sometime if you haven't already.
136562	138964	Anyhow, we're going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week.
139004	140045	It's always how they start the show.
141405	142566	We are back from a week off.
143006	147167	One week ago was Halloween, so we just decided, you know what, let's just take a weekend off.
147428	148848	There's a lot going on in the real world.
149288	153070	I had a bunch of stuff to do for one of my other hobbies, so we didn't even tape a show.
153450	154530	You know, Loki's got the baby.
154570	158672	DarkSakura's got, I guess, other podcasts now that are bigger than this little shit show.
158712	160512	No, I have a big, fat, hairy cat.
161032	161312	You do?
161633	162253	Who has Twitter?
162273	163493	Yes, Shermie has Twitter.
163513	164714	When did Shermie get a Twitter?
165034	165614	A few days ago.
165994	167014	Who signed her up for Twitter?
167255	168335	Was that you or was that a fan?
169574	170076	That was me.
170337	171520	Oh, okay.
171620	172844	But she does all the typing, right?
173851	174371	Good times.
200959	202540	That's what I have to deal with sitting in that chair.
202580	203320	She doesn't do it to you.
204401	204561	No.
204741	206042	That's because Rob's feet smell.
206282	206942	My feet are smelly.
208003	209464	Let's quickly plug the side projects.
209524	211945	Usually we'll save this for the end of the show because this was brought up a minute ago.
212465	215087	DarkSakura, you have a side project called?
215667	216888	Comic Insanity.
217528	220430	It's insanity without an I in the front of it.
220490	221791	So there's only one I and not two.
222891	226273	That's at Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net.
227113	228474	And we go live on Tuesdays.
229195	229415	Awesome.
230255	234337	It's just comic books, although today we were without a Maren Marvel.
234957	235298	Sad.
235638	237559	Yeah, because she has a new house or something.
237619	237999	I don't know.
239500	239700	No.
239860	240340	Hard, hard, hard.
241681	247143	But it's me and Tiara, Maren Marvel, and Dan Shadow.
247944	248324	Good times.
249224	250505	Who plays WoW with me now.
250625	251385	Who plays WoW with you now.
251405	252146	Yes, good times.
252406	254467	But I don't play WoW with you.
254969	259571	Nope, both Marvel and Dan Shadow play WoW with me, but not you.
259912	260692	I'm not a sheep.
260892	261593	That's fine, that's fine.
261853	263674	Speaking of WoW... I play Star Trek.
264314	265975	Speaking of WoW, that's my new side project.
266475	268076	Extifer and I have reunited.
268196	277941	For those that listened to OLR back when it was a station, before the whole merger with All Games some time ago, we were doing a show called Guys on a Show, which is more like a pop culture thing, but now we do a Warcraft show.
278341	279222	We just did a pilot...
279582	280663	The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth
308439	309740	I love the name Is it Disneyland right now?
330569	331550	Actdeft says guys on an MMO
346764	374158	I did play some Star Trek online and finally now that I have a shiny new headset I've been able to play on TeamSpeak with my Scottish guildmates or fleetmates I should say and I love listening to Scottish accents a whole lot actually one of the other guys I think in Holland and one of the other guys was in New York when we're playing we have another guy in Hawaii there's I think like three or four of us who live in the United States the rest all live in the UK and other places in Europe
375438	376079	But it's pretty fun.
376979	382503	I only get to see them when it's like before four here because then it's, you know, close to midnight there.
383564	389308	And then I... Okay, Rob, don't hate.
389748	390268	Don't judge me.
391029	391409	Judging.
392870	393690	Getting ready to judge.
393770	394391	Gavel raised.
394631	395372	I got Second Life.
398974	402856	So that I could see what the stupid Na'vi universe looks like.
405475	405775	Wow.
406296	409919	Well, it's because I... You are guilty of nerddom!
410159	411460	Oh my god.
411941	417366	Well, I wanted to see... I said, you know, before I actually judged Second Life, I was going to see what it's like.
418847	419447	That's fair.
419828	426073	I guess you should try something... And I figured I would go to... Even if it's dressing up as a big smurf and running around...
427494	433277	Oh, I said instead of doing, you know, I would try to do something that I couldn't really do in another game online.
433297	438039	Because I kind of, I thought it would be a great idea for them to do like an Avatar MMO.
438540	440420	I guess that thing would be lose all self-respect.
441141	441501	No.
443722	448184	And I've only been on it like four times just running around and going, oh, this is pretty, oh, this is pretty.
448904	450165	Second Life controls like shit.
451366	452126	Just letting you all know.
453467	454547	The chat on there sucks.
455267	456188	It controls like it is.
457317	462220	And... I... It was free, okay?
462440	469544	In our chatroom, salaciouspop at chat.orangelondradio.com says, I am jumping in front of Jamie in slow motion going, No!
469604	471705	It's a terrorist bomb counts down to zero.
474587	477608	I mean, get some self-respect.
477728	480050	Play a Harry Potter universe if you have to.
481130	481430	Rob.
481571	482951	I'm just... I'm messing with you.
485307	489649	Well, at any rate, it's not horrible.
490749	494811	But after seeing some of the other stuff on there, I was like, yeah, I don't really have to play this that much.
494951	496232	I've actually got a good game to play.
496972	497452	We got Rock Band 3.
498512	501374	So we played a lot of Rock Band 3 since a few days ago.
501454	503575	We actually got it on Halloween.
504635	505575	So we've been playing it since then.
506636	506716	Um...
508556	509939	I'm trying to think what else because I've played a lot of games.
509959	510680	Did you guys get the keyboard?
510941	511361	Yes, we did.
511842	512403	Have you tried it?
512964	513465	I don't like it.
513565	518575	It hurts my hand after a while because I want to hold the right keyboard position and it makes my hand hurt.
519309	521470	Dan has beaten Fable 3 within a few days of getting the game.
521510	522270	My pro tip to everybody...
547757	551400	Make sure you have six million gold by the time you actually beat that part of the game.
553923	557406	By the time you're the king or queen or whatever you're going to be.
558867	566794	I love all the voices in that game because seriously, Jonathan Ross is in it doing announcement when you're beating up monsters and I love it.
567555	568336	I love Jonathan Ross.
570006	571967	He's the one with the slight speech impediment.
572948	578992	Well, he speaks with the ahs and not the ahs.
579132	580813	How's Fable 3 similar or different?
580833	581974	Simon Pegg does voices in it.
582214	582675	I love him.
583575	588739	By the way, somebody came to Rocky, which was the thing I was doing last week and not here at the show.
589079	590039	We had a costume contest.
590079	592061	The winner was dressed up as Sean from Shaun of the Dead.
592361	593482	And it was like A+.
593682	594222	It was perfect.
594242	595423	The guy looked the part and everything.
595983	596063	A+.
596284	598065	I would have to glomp on him.
600186	602688	But, you were saying how does it play?
603368	605750	I was going to say, how's Fable 3 compared to the last one, Fable 2?
606550	608591	It's got lots of good and lots of bad.
608632	615196	The quest thing, instead of being able to just change your quests and things, you don't even have a menu anymore.
615256	624842	You go back to this sanctuary, and then if you're trying to find a person to start a particular quest, it doesn't always teleport you right to them.
625402	626843	Oh, Rob's going to give us diseases.
628024	628284	Sorry.
628304	628404	Sorry.
629986	630186	No.
631427	632047	I have stuff going on.
632107	633468	I have to do eye drops every three hours.
633508	633829	Rob's a zombie.
633849	634149	It's time.
634349	635029	Yeah, I'm a zombie.
635550	636050	Brains.
637991	638852	But, no.
639032	639612	Navi.
640293	640633	Shut up.
642454	644576	But, it's not bad.
644616	647598	I mean, there's definitely a lot of glitchiness in it.
647618	654862	And you know what really sucks is that when you have to take people places, you can't just tell them to follow you.
654942	658405	You have to hold their hand and take them with you.
659265	660706	and that's really irritating.
660946	667070	And also I can see the seam on the dog and the textures and it's kind of meh.
667370	668851	Dogs do have seams though.
670612	671552	Yeah, but not like that.
671632	674454	Not from the top of their head to the base of their tail.
675135	675995	Sure they do.
676095	678957	You'd expect you to see stitches or something.
679657	682900	Um, and then there's, like, a bunch of annoying people.
683040	686923	I love one of the, quote, bad guys in the game, Reaver.
687684	689966	He's just so ostentatious.
690066	690467	I love him.
691487	693749	And he's so evil and such a bastard.
693849	694490	I love him to death.
695511	695591	Um...
697492	703373	And then I played Robot Unicorn Attack in the middle of Starbucks at 11 o'clock last night.
705754	714096	Oh, we had one of mine and Dan's friends over beat Little Nemo, the Dream Master, on Nintendo in our vault last night.
714556	715196	Wow, random.
715256	716957	That game's actually kind of hard, you know?
720860	722062	I played a bunch of other stuff too.
722362	723284	I beat Peggle Knights.
724886	725867	It's actually kind of hard.
726648	729813	It's harder than the first Peggle.
731836	733037	Lots of plants versus zombies.
733077	734740	I'm almost done growing my tree of life.
736132	740634	or whatever, the Tree of Knowledge or whatever the crap the tree is.
741414	743755	It's the Tree of Worthless Advice is what it is.
744595	745095	Okay, then.
745315	747776	Stuff I've already figured out, but you get an achievement for it, so whatever.
747936	756219	Oh, and for anyone who has beaten mustache mode, all you have to do is just type mustache while you're playing and all the zombies will get mustaches and you'll be in mustache mode.
757860	758260	Okay.
759801	761901	I know, it's completely retarded.
762062	763262	I love how stupid that game is.
765711	767953	I know I've played a bunch of stuff this week.
768334	770816	Oh yeah, and I played Dance Masters tonight.
771557	774359	And I did Pala Pala dancing.
774379	777162	What did you think of Dance Masters on the Xbox Kinect?
777562	778423	The other dance game.
778703	779544	I liked Para Para.
781055	782076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
804274	815619	They were playing Dance Central and there's this little solo freestyle part in it and Rob was going in and shaking his butt and jumping up and down.
815679	818121	And then it plays back in high speed.
818361	820282	Rob peeking out, Rob peeking out, Rob's butt.
822243	826005	And you just see Loki kind of flailing.
826405	829266	He was actually doing stuff but when it speeds it up it looks like he's flailing.
830547	831467	Kind of what the Kinect is.
831527	832508	It's the Microsoft flail.
833174	834394	Yeah, the Microsoft flail.
835054	835715	I like that.
835835	836875	That's what I'm going to call it from now on.
836915	838475	Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
839836	840356	Bam!
840896	842196	Which is what I'm going to take a picture of.
842516	843217	Alright, you do that.
843977	852919	Dan and I found a bunch of our video game soundtracks so we've been ripping them and I found a VCD of Parapara Panic Volume 2 and 3.
853979	854499	Good times.
854539	856700	I also found a Parapara DVD that belongs to Loki.
858542	859303	Random.
859383	860444	The Parapara Master.
860464	861305	He's like, that ain't mine.
862346	863427	Parapara Master?
863707	865849	Yeah, you loaned it to me like five years ago.
865869	866770	I don't even remember that.
867010	868631	Hold on.
868752	870653	Okay, everybody else.
870773	871754	Going to the chat room real quick.
871814	880122	Spazinator in our chat room says, if someone were to put ABBA, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Dance Central, and SingStar into a blender and then puked out the resulting game, Sky would probably squeal.
882104	882925	Yeah, probably.
883485	884807	It stinks!
904170	905151	It was okay, I guess.
906112	909754	I like the message at the end, but otherwise it was censored and dopey.
910114	910755	What is this?
911155	912116	It's Kidz Bop.
913357	917200	Loki, you want to talk about digging through old treasures?
917220	921203	It must have been something I got for free when I was ordering VCDs.
921383	923244	Get VCDs.com, special price.
923685	926807	Must have been free.
927227	928088	Hi, you're Gaming Week, yes.
928695	929275	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
956451	960153	I started off playing some of the demos for Joyride and Dance Central.
960954	968898	And really the demo for Dance Central, which is on the disc, so if they put it on Xbox Live Marketplace, you don't really need to download it because it's already on the disc.
971559	977602	It's only got two songs on the demo, which were Poker Face by Lady Gaga and Poison.
979563	983705	Poison is a lot more difficult than Poker Face, that's for sure, because...
985071	987573	I'm like, okay, Poker Face, that was really easy.
987613	988734	I'm going to go in the poison.
989094	990455	It's like, okay, break it down.
990936	991356	Do this.
991696	994118	I'm like, I can't do that.
995540	997481	Some 90s dance moves and stuff.
997521	1009211	But I think actually if you play through Dance Central, through the songs in the actual order that they're in there, from easiest to hardest, I think it would be a lot easier to pick up some of the stuff because some of the moves are just...
1010512	1013394	It's a little tough for me to wrap my brain around it.
1014475	1015596	But yeah, it's a fun game.
1015856	1021840	I played Dance Masters a little bit, or I should say I watched Dance Masters a little bit.
1022881	1030727	The thing that's really frustrating about that game, although I have to say I didn't try the lesson modes, so maybe that breaks it down a little bit more, but...
1032228	1034669	It basically says, okay, go.
1035429	1039530	And then it starts doing stuff and you start messing up because you don't know what the hell you're supposed to be doing.
1040010	1041970	And that's it.
1042110	1043330	And you just act confused.
1043450	1051212	Unless, of course, you've played lots of Parapar and you know some of the Parapar dances, in which case there's at least four songs you'll be able to do just fine.
1052152	1054753	But the rest of them are just very confusing.
1055513	1057034	A lot of songs from DDR.
1057374	1058935	A ton of songs from DDR.
1059556	1071583	Everything from the Parapar songs to Sakura, Exotic Ethnic, Let the Beat Hit Em, Keep on Movin', Higher...
1072844	1074545	I'm trying to think of some of the other songs that were in there.
1076246	1077847	But yeah, a lot of DDR stuff.
1078508	1085273	And honestly, as Rob was saying when he was actually looking at the game, the game looks a lot better than Dance Central.
1085333	1086894	Yeah, I was surprised.
1086954	1090356	Dance Masters is actually a better looking game than Dance Central.
1090456	1090736	The way...
1094319	1097302	is a lot cooler than those little flashcards going up the side.
1097542	1103928	I think the flashcards going up the side makes the dance, in practicality, like you said, it's easier to learn that way, whereas it's just kind of like throw it in and do it.
1104248	1111894	But if you're just kind of trying to show off the poses and stuff, I think with the silhouettes collapsing in and the rings that show up, I think the game looks awesome.
1112215	1117019	And I think if you were to pull it off the way you're supposed to, which I know some folks might be surprised.
1117059	1119601	They were expecting me to come on here and say Dance Masters is full of fail.
1119961	1120342	But there's...
1120902	1122083	Some interesting parts in there.
1122363	1125726	I think the interface itself is pretty sleek when you're playing the game.
1125966	1126967	I like the look a lot.
1126987	1135273	It's interesting as far as some of the songs that are in there and stuff, because I think it'd be fun to see what the routines are for them.
1135654	1139657	Obviously, and this goes for both games, there are some songs like, for example...
1140277	1150441	Poker Face and stuff that I would feel like an idiot doing, you know, in real life versus, you know, some of the songs, you know, like Poison and stuff that have really good dance steps to them.
1150941	1165207	I mean, obviously they have to simple, you know, have some simple songs in there so you can learn it because, you know, a lot of it's like, oh, I could do that, but it's actually really hard sometimes to figure out what they want you to do and you have to kind of do it a few times, Bill, to understand what you need to do in the game, but...
1166047	1166707	Dance Masters.
1167248	1170669	The other thing I don't like about Dance Masters is the actual menus.
1170769	1177071	The way they have you navigate it is not very intuitive, and a lot of times they end up selecting things they didn't want to select.
1178172	1179212	Was that Dance Central?
1179532	1180353	No, Dance Masters.
1180793	1181993	I have problems with Dance Central.
1182033	1188416	I don't know if that's just the Kinect device itself, but trying to select a song is a pain in the ass sometimes on Dance Central.
1189056	1190496	Yeah.
1190536	1194417	But the thing with Dance Central, though, is you can actually use the controller to select stuff if you want to.
1194597	1195698	Oh, didn't even try it.
1195838	1196038	Yeah.
1196078	1197278	Derp, derp.
1197938	1199178	So that's kind of neat.
1199318	1201859	And then other things... Can I say this real quick, though, about Dance Central?
1202059	1203739	Some of those moves are kind of embarrassing, too.
1203779	1204579	This is Dance Central.
1204680	1206800	Again, we keep kind of going back and forth between the dance moves.
1206820	1207240	Yeah, they are.
1207620	1208860	Here's the easiest way to remember.
1209100	1211001	Dance Central has real songs.
1211301	1213762	Dance Masters has DDR songs.
1214182	1214902	Like, which...
1216262	1218103	I realize some people consider them real songs.
1218143	1224885	I don't mean to spit in the eye of what we grew up on, but it's not music you're going to hear out in the real world.
1224905	1231587	If you're a fan of DDR and you buy Dance Masters, you probably think, oh, originally, you're like, okay, well, I know para stuff is going to be in there.
1231607	1233368	You think, oh, it's just all para-para dancing.
1233988	1260199	well they have like a lot of songs from DDR and it was kind of cool to see a lot of that stuff on there but there's really only a couple songs that weren't in DDR or at least I didn't recognize in DDR I think though those of you guys that like grew up on DDR and have been playing for years and years ever logged into if you had an account on DDR Freak at any point in time go buy Dance Masters the rest of you get Dance Central that's that's really how it kind of breaks down
1260479	1272162	Dance Central I like because a long time ago I actually took a dance class and the way they teach you how to do the different routines is the way you would learn it in a dance class, which is kind of cool.
1273403	1279584	I enjoy that game a lot more because you get an idea of what you're supposed to do, even though they do have the flashcards.
1279704	1284986	If that's not for you, if you know the routine and you just want to do it, you can turn those flashcards off.
1286046	1313134	anybody who's ever loved Para Para Paradise or even liked it you need to get Dance Masters because it basically is Para Para Paradise under a different name and just a different gameplay mechanic but like the Night of Fire dance is the same dance yes it is it's something remember like way back in the day I was like hey you know what would be kind of cool is if they had a para game with like different genres of music in there not just para para that's Dance Masters it's basically funny
1314055	1322741	Let me go back to Dance Central for a minute, because Loki was talking about some of the embarrassing dance moves that happened in that game, and I'll tell you, I don't know if you've tried, have you played, you haven't really played the demo, or outside the demo, huh?
1323182	1324403	Um, not too much, no.
1324423	1327705	Okay, I was playing the full version I was playing, there's a song by M.I.A.
1327925	1333730	called Galang, and I don't know if you've ever heard this song, but let me play a little bit of it for the listeners here in, uh, listening to the song.
1335271	1341416	Which, this is an awesome song, yeah, I really like this song, but like, the way you dance to this song, it's like you like...
1343497	1343957	Dance Central?
1344097	1344577	Dance Masters.
1367004	1368045	I can't tell them apart!
1368486	1372529	Dance Central, I'm surprised that they didn't have that because they have all the moves broken down.
1372549	1380296	You should be able to just order them in a way to create a routine and it wouldn't be that difficult for the actual on-screen dancers to follow it.
1380576	1381758	Dance Central...
1382458	1385400	is very much a first game, as is Dance Masters.
1385700	1398390	I mean, you have to go, okay, Dance Central is like the first Guitar Hero game, which led to Guitar Hero 2, which led to Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3, which led to where we're at now with Rock Band 3.
1399090	1405154	So the potential is there for something really cool, but this first game is definitely like a bare-bones thing.
1405255	1406896	But it'll be a hit at parties.
1407576	1408577	Either one will be, really.
1408894	1409514	It'll be pretty fun.
1426183	1427244	A couple reasons why I bought it.
1427384	1428325	One, because it looked fun.
1428565	1431867	And two, it was one of the games I was able to get early.
1432527	1435629	And then also Kinect Sports, which I actually haven't touched yet.
1436289	1438250	So I can't really give any impressions on it.
1438570	1445234	I do still want to get possibly your self-fitness or your shape fitness or whatever the hell it's called.
1446795	1451598	Just to try that out because right now I can't get out to the gym even if I wanted to.
1452158	1453459	There's just no time of the day.
1453880	1456082	And I think it would be nice to have some sort of exercise program.
1456122	1465229	And honestly, I would prefer getting the EA Sports Active 2.01 because it looks like it's a lot more structured.
1465269	1469933	They actually have a nine-week program you can go through and a bunch of neat features for that.
1470574	1471855	Problem is, it's $100.
1472015	1477960	And I really don't want to spend $100 on a game, even if it does work out pretty well.
1478040	1478240	But...
1480862	1481162	I don't know.
1481603	1485006	It'd be neat to just try that stuff because it looks like that might work pretty well.
1486207	1487669	But yeah, I'm looking forward to more stuff.
1487709	1497638	Hopefully they actually start having indie games and Xbox Live Arcade games that support Kinect stuff and hopefully we get into some more different types of games other than stuff.
1497658	1500801	Yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing the different genres.
1500841	1503764	Because all the games that are launched are like dance, fitness...
1505806	1509770	Interpretations of Wii games from their launch party.
1510771	1515276	But we have yet to see how is Kinect going to affect Gears of War, if at all.
1516037	1516978	Please hear me out.
1517038	1519982	I'm not saying every game needs to have Kinect shoved in it.
1520042	1521664	In fact, that would make me very disappointed.
1522825	1524467	But I'm saying a Gears of War-esque...
1525007	1528548	And now you think you need to go too crazy with some of that stuff.
1528648	1535090	I think it would be neat to have a game where you play it on the couch, it just supports Kinect, but you're still using the controller.
1535150	1547314	Say, for example, you're peeking around a corner or something, you just lean with your controller in hand, you lean to the side and your character peeks around the corner instead of you having to hit a button or something like that.
1547574	1551315	Just really subtle stuff.
1551795	1560463	I don't think you need to actually flail around or something, but I think adding a little bit of extra stuff or maybe voice commands to different things might be kind of neat.
1563106	1564487	Just do it tastefully.
1564607	1566068	Don't have Halo Connect.
1569511	1581140	And something you touched on a little bit there that I wanted to definitely mention and expand on a little bit is the more minority report style stuff that's in the Xbox Kinect, meaning that it will identify your face and sign you in.
1581360	1582201	You have to calibrate.
1582221	1585463	You have to go through this somewhat extensive calibration in Kinect ID.
1586404	1592128	And for it to work really well, you have to do it in the daytime, in the nighttime, with all your lights on, with some of your lights on.
1592428	1593429	You have to do it a few times.
1593629	1593949	Hey, Rob, but...
1609485	1611067	Hey girl, what it do?
1611247	1612268	No, it's not going to do that, okay?
1612368	1617292	It's just like... But I will not have to pick up a controller at all.
1617752	1625679	In fact, I have gone so far as to eject the game, put in the new game, walk away, and then I'll go Xbox, connect, close tray.
1626139	1628902	And it knows who I am, starts and closes the tray.
1628942	1629322	I mean, it's...
1631183	1633364	Kind of scary in some regards, but neat.
1633764	1636405	I want to see that expanded on, though, because it's very limited right now.
1636425	1638485	There's only very certain commands.
1638505	1641126	You can't be like, Xbox, paint my house.
1641646	1645608	It's not going to know how to do anything but close the tray and go to your friends list.
1646628	1654150	And then also, the fact that actually those voice commands work with pretty much anybody.
1654830	1657151	My wife is yelling stuff.
1657271	1659612	She's like, I can hear a fear through stuff without...
1660182	1660542	DarkSakura.com
1688105	1693987	The nice little calibration cards that come with a lot of the games that are high contrast, black and white.
1694407	1695047	What do they do?
1695367	1696647	It's for calibrating the system.
1696667	1697628	I have yet to use them.
1697668	1699288	Well, you can use it to calibrate the system.
1699728	1709951	It's a little smiley face, and it's placed so that the glasses are on the smiley face, and so you move it back and forth, and it calibrates the sensor to get distance or whatever.
1710391	1711071	Where is that?
1711091	1711532	In the dashboard?
1711552	1711772	Yeah.
1713232	1714953	and then the little Kinect dashboard thing.
1715653	1716253	I've done it once.
1716773	1718334	Anyways, but that's not the point.
1718574	1728137	The point is my son loves staring at that thing and just like plays with it and just like and smiling is so happy.
1728157	1730278	It's literally his favorite toy now.
1730298	1735539	Loki, I'm just saying you could go get like a little piece of cardboard at Target for like 10 cents and a Sharpie marker.
1735939	1737400	You can make a million of those.
1737500	1740461	Oh, I know that, but I'm just saying it's an added bonus.
1741181	1742722	because they come with a bunch of them.
1742742	1746024	Because I got it with it and it says, do not throw this away.
1746044	1747585	I'm like, what the hell is this?
1748185	1750466	Do I have to hold this in front of the camera or something?
1750566	1752908	And Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room is echoing you.
1752948	1754249	It's in the Connect Tuner on the Connect Hub.
1754329	1755629	I thought I went through that setup.
1756010	1757751	So there's a whole nother calibration I didn't even do?
1757791	1758871	There's another calibration setup.
1758891	1759412	God.
1760072	1761413	There's a lot of calibrating to do with this.
1761573	1762453	But see, that's the other thing too.
1762473	1766936	It's been working fine without all that fine calibration except the fact that I live in a tiny apartment and don't have a lot of space.
1767631	1774878	Yeah, that only means that you can't play Connected Adventures two-player because it requires eight feet or whatever in order to play two players on that.
1775238	1777421	A lot of the other games don't really give a crap.
1777501	1781885	In fact, I'd say Jamie's living room here, that was maybe like six feet.
1782325	1783246	Yeah, it worked.
1783507	1784107	It worked just fine.
1784908	1786850	I had no problem with that little par-par-a.
1787230	1792231	Yeah, it's just Connect Adventures, I think, is really... I don't even know if it necessarily needs that.
1792351	1794952	It's just that they don't want you smacking into each other.
1795532	1797453	Have you done the video chat at all?
1797613	1797713	No.
1798233	1799333	It's really creepy.
1799473	1801754	Try it, because the Connect will follow you around.
1802154	1803434	Like, I was sitting in the chair.
1803694	1805655	Like, I wasn't actually chatting with anyone, but you can see your window.
1805715	1808196	And then, like, if I stand up, like, the Connect follows me.
1808596	1812017	And if I kind of move... Like, it follows you around, which is kind of creepy.
1812037	1813217	You can only move up and down, right?
1813897	1817280	Marissa Congusto I do not want a system that hits on me or notices if I have gained weight
1832557	1833757	Oh, that would be a terrible one, wouldn't it?
1834838	1835978	Xbox, connect.
1836519	1837139	Hi, Rob.
1837659	1839820	Oh, you might want to stop eating donuts.
1840000	1842221	I thought they were having a feature or there was something.
1842461	1847123	Maybe it was in one of those, like, you know, here's what it possibly can do.
1847183	1850004	You know, where I'm scanning my skateboard and that bull crap.
1850784	1855386	Where, like, it could scan your image and it makes an avatar character out of that.
1855612	1860333	Well, what's also going to be interesting is what future firmware updates will do because the technology is there now.
1860393	1862854	Now it's about really kind of squeezing out the potential of it.
1863194	1868055	I'm kind of curious to see what next year's update will bring because it's probably more of this stuff.
1868075	1869355	Probably more like browsing.
1869395	1872876	It won't probably be just like you'll be able to browse the marketplace or something like that.
1873557	1874997	Dance Masters fact sheet.
1875017	1876577	Apparently there is a lesson mode.
1877658	1881459	Yeah, that would be nice because stepping right into the dance mode is like, huh?
1881479	1881879	Yeah.
1881899	1882199	All right.
1882379	1883279	Anything else for your gaming week?
1884291	1890294	Yeah, other than Xbox and Kinect stuff, well, actually, I played Rock Band 3 briefly.
1890535	1892336	I just got around to it.
1892696	1897258	One of my systems actually died on me, and I had it fixed, so that was nice.
1898079	1910946	And I played, well, I spent a lot of the time just recreating my band, the, what was it, Unfit Barf Bags, because that was the random band name it gave me in Rock Band 2.
1911206	1913247	And so I just stuck with it, and it was funny.
1914027	1917489	I had to try that out, it was awesome I thought it was relatively easy for keyboard though
1939130	1944138	Yeah, and of course, I didn't bother doing keyboards in normal mode because that's just retarded with the five keys.
1945039	1947483	I stuck with the pro mode and just stick with easy.
1947683	1951750	Well, if you actually want to be able to play things like Bohemian Rhapsody, you got to do five key.
1952190	1953693	Well, why can't you just play it on easy?
1954406	1955427	Oh, okay, yeah, you can do it on easy.
1955447	1956929	I mean, you can do easy in promo.
1957089	1958030	I think that's the way to do it.
1959631	1960652	I've done a little bit of both.
1960753	1967579	Like, I can actually beat Just Like Heaven and Imagine on, like, expert pro keys, but it took a little while to kind of get there.
1967619	1970182	But it's cool that I can do it after practicing.
1970682	1972284	I had problems with, you know...
1973585	1974426	Thanks for watching!
1991139	1992420	I had my hands too far to the left
2018538	2044157	tried that tried a little bit of Sonic 4 Episode 1 on the iPod and it's terrible as I figured it would be thankfully I didn't buy it and what else oh yeah a little bit of Space Invaders Infinity Gene which I love that game it's pretty awesome that's pretty much it
2045182	2045622	Thanks for watching!
2061073	2066776	Dance Central, which is fine, but the interface bugs me and doesn't control very well.
2066816	2069878	But now that I know about this extra calibration stuff, maybe I need to try that.
2069938	2074060	So now that I know, and knowing's half the battle, I'll try that a little more.
2074160	2077342	But otherwise, the dances are kind of fun, and it's a pretty good workout.
2077422	2080323	And that's the best thing about Connect, is that it's a good workout.
2080343	2082285	They do have a calorie counter for the Dance Central.
2082305	2082765	I noticed.
2082845	2083805	Yeah, oh yeah, I turned it on.
2083885	2084686	It's good.
2085726	2087347	The photo mode's a little creepy.
2087427	2088747	I think I might need to turn that off.
2089767	2093988	I don't like being required to wear pants to play Xbox in my own house.
2094008	2098210	Also, with the Connect Adventures stuff, there's that ConnectShare.com website.
2098250	2099270	Yeah.
2099410	2103111	I'm afraid that one day I'm going to be sitting there playing with no pants on.
2103491	2104872	Look, it's the privacy of my own house.
2105112	2105672	Come on, guys.
2105792	2107532	You know pants are restrictive.
2107812	2109393	So sometimes you like to play with no pants.
2110573	2112354	I was playing in my pajamas.
2112734	2120419	Yeah, that's what I'll do now because I am like deathly afraid that the machine is going to take a picture of me and like upload it to my Facebook without me knowing.
2120759	2124661	And I realize this is a totally irrational fear and like, yes, these modes can be turned off.
2124962	2130545	But come on, like it's like this part of technology kind of freaks me out or it's like suddenly, you know.
2131815	2134156	Everybody's going to know if it's boxers or briefs.
2134696	2138999	There's certain things that my Facebook friends do not need to know about.
2139459	2141060	And what color I'm wearing today is one of them.
2143701	2144301	You know what I mean?
2145082	2145362	Yeah.
2146582	2147843	So, anyhow.
2149042	2149543	Jumble, jumble, jumble
2176108	2178991	Look, look, I swear I didn't even look at you.
2179032	2180313	Jessica Harper's in our chat tonight.
2180473	2181935	Hell, I'd play braless.
2182155	2183496	Did I call it or did I call it?
2183516	2183957	Thank you very much.
2184177	2189643	Well, the first thing that I did after Loki was setting up the connectors, I went in and put on a sports bra.
2190304	2193848	Because I didn't want to kill myself.
2194068	2194588	Thank you, Jess.
2194628	2195748	Jessica's backing me up here.
2195828	2197209	My house is a bra-free zone, 100%.
2197329	2198569	There you go.
2199329	2202710	Kitsune says, I don't want people to see me in my undies, so I got to make sure I wear pants.
2203070	2206110	That's the same completely irrational fear that I have.
2206490	2215372	Like, with this technology, the way it is, like, I need something in the intro to the game to assure me, hi, Rob, I promise I won't take pictures of you with no pants on.
2216072	2216752	Then we'll be fine.
2216772	2221313	Like, as long as the Connect and I have that mutual understanding that we're not taking pictures, I'll be fine.
2221753	2227637	Rob, now remember now, here's something to be afraid of, I guess.
2227677	2230799	Well, in fact, actually, I guess it doesn't really shine too much of a spot.
2230980	2239966	Remember those, I think they were Sony cameras, actually, that had an infrared filter mode or something like that, and people were using them to see through people's clothes?
2240786	2243188	It might not matter with the Kinect camera.
2244649	2247011	It will be undressing you with its lenses.
2247031	2247611	Yeah.
2248391	2254595	Bobby Blackwolf says, to be fair, ConnectShare.com only shows your own photos or videos that you upload from the game.
2254615	2257977	You can't find anyone else's stuff.
2258037	2259618	There's hackers out there, Bobby.
2260418	2261819	They're hacking everyone on out here.
2263547	2265028	Hide your pants, hide your bras.
2265048	2267030	You know what I want, though, with the Kinect?
2267050	2272634	The fact that it shoots infrared lights in a really neat pattern across the room.
2272774	2275677	I want a laser light show, damn it, because it's already doing that.
2275777	2276958	I want it so that I can see it.
2277178	2282302	Yes, the Michael Jackson game that's coming out should do Michael Jackson laser shows, like the one I saw in Seattle last year.
2283543	2289948	Am I the only one that feels like I should not look directly into the Kinect because there's that little red light that looks like a laser, which I'm sure is the infrared thing.
2290028	2290629	It is a laser.
2291429	2294510	Oh my god, have you ever caught yourself staring right into it going, this isn't a good idea?
2295050	2296711	Yes.
2296771	2298371	It's the mind control device.
2298391	2298651	It's Skynet.
2298671	2303153	It's like, wait a second, I recognize that red lint in your eye.
2303933	2304713	You're Terminator.
2305233	2306934	Sent back from the future to kill me.
2308374	2309775	Uh oh, look what I started in chat.
2309795	2312235	Chat.orange.com Satellite minded.
2312536	2314016	They're climbing in your windows.
2314056	2315576	They're snatching your pictures up.
2318737	2320378	That's exactly what I'm talking about.
2321983	2322243	Anyhow.
2325567	2326028	Moving on.
2326108	2327430	Oh yes, other things I played this week.
2327490	2328771	I also played Rock Band 3.
2329332	2330734	You know I loves me some keyboards.
2331094	2341387	My least favorite thing about Rock Band 3 is that there's not enough songs to play with the keyboards because I have like 300 songs in my library now thanks to Rock Band 1, Rock Band 2, all the download stuff which is a really obscene amount.
2342067	2344828	I really hope they go back soon and add the key support.
2344888	2347348	Yes, I know it's supposed to be coming, so I'll stop bitching.
2347388	2349249	But that's the only thing that bugs me about it.
2349309	2351069	Otherwise, I think it's a fantastic upgrade.
2351629	2355090	And if you own Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 1, drop the extra money.
2355150	2356550	Drop the 50, 60 bucks and get this.
2356890	2359871	The whole dropping in and out will be great for parties.
2360251	2363852	I think the song select mode and being able to filter stuff is so much more intuitive.
2364132	2365212	I think they really have learned.
2365232	2367213	They have just created an incredible music game.
2367253	2368033	And it really makes me go...
2368473	2370094	What the hell are we going to get in Rock Band 4?
2370274	2371255	And the sorting is awesome.
2371275	2372276	This is already blowing my mind.
2372316	2374178	Oh, the sorting is outstanding.
2374658	2375198	Outstanding.
2376059	2379302	Real quick, just because it does kind of tie into the whole Kinect thing.
2379742	2380963	What do you think of the new dashboard?
2383645	2384306	It's purpley.
2384506	2386247	It's not that different from the old one.
2386387	2391011	Although, how much have they tried to kind of emulate the Wii?
2391612	2392993	Right on down to the whole little...
2396149	2406377	Little background noises that you hear when you're in the... Kind of what it sounds like when you're in the menus.
2407218	2408179	And all the cuteness.
2410481	2411521	I don't like how white it is.
2411541	2414924	It's been inspired from Nintendo.
2414944	2416025	You got a problem with white things?
2416565	2416966	Yes, I do.
2417786	2418287	Sorry to hear that.
2428013	2432277	BlackWolf says they are adding Bon Jovi keyboard support this week, so they're going through the back catalog.
2432317	2433578	Yeah, I know, I know.
2434458	2435259	I'm just impatient.
2436220	2438001	So what if I have 63 songs to play right now?
2438041	2438501	It's not enough.
2438942	2442084	Plus, some of the keyboard parts are really dopey.
2442605	2443225	Like, um...
2444890	2446091	Is it Everybody Wants to Rule?
2446111	2447211	No, that one, it's the other one.
2449112	2451253	One of those songs, I always get the bands mixed up.
2452273	2454274	Tears for Fears is Everyone Wants to Rule the World, right?
2454374	2454874	In Excess.
2455514	2457055	Need You Tonight is the song.
2457595	2459556	Has the dumbest keyboard part ever.
2459716	2462757	It's just 27 notes, even on expert.
2462817	2465779	And it's just do, do, do, boo.
2466139	2467059	And that's the keyboard part.
2467239	2469220	Do, do, do, wah.
2469641	2478318	and so you're playing the wow like 27 times in the song it's ridiculous like you could beat it on expert and your score will be like 4700 tops this is funny
2482216	2506362	but anyhow uh yeah um the game's fun and and the keyboard stuff will get better with the download packs and everything you know i'm actually like tempted to go find like a ten dollar copy of lego rock band just to import those songs into my massive collection i did i because i bet you can find them really cheap used now or not used uh with the code uh new new dude they still make it right
2507382	2509003	Yeah, I can probably find it on Amazon or something.
2509043	2510423	I don't think it's dropped in price too much.
2511263	2514284	All right, I want to talk about a game no one's talked about yet, and then we'll get into gaming news.
2514384	2515885	I know we've been doing this for a very long time.
2515925	2516825	There's been a lot of games this week.
2517466	2520827	Pinball FX 2 came out on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
2520867	2521587	Got it, by the way.
2521887	2523748	It's free, which is awesome.
2524228	2532631	And if you owned Pinball FX 1, the game will go, oh, hey, since you were a loyal Pinball FX 1 user, I'm going to just import those tables right on into Pinball FX 2.
2533701	2536043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2556781	2558942	and just all the different features that are in it now.
2559522	2566705	Supposedly it does stuff with the Xbox Live vision camera, which made me laugh because now that everything's pushing Kinect, it's kind of funny that the vision camera's in there.
2567025	2568545	I don't know if it uses either or.
2568685	2573367	I'm not interested in playing pinball with a camera, but apparently it will take video of you when you're playing on Xbox Live.
2573387	2574868	I should try selling back my vision camera too.
2575868	2576528	Like five bucks.
2576548	2578269	Here you can play Totem Ball.
2578849	2579109	All right.
2580610	2581070	Give you a nickel.
2581090	2586612	But yeah, I was just very happy that all the tables re-imported and they have a more robust demo system.
2586672	2592434	And yeah, just you can sense that the physics have been upgraded and the interface has been upgraded and everything has gotten a little tweak.
2593375	2594695	We've been talking about Rock Band, right?
2595356	2595976	Same type of thing.
2596596	2598218	Pimbal FX Pimbal FX
2619577	2628746	I look at a game like this and I go, with Game Room being in the state that it's in right now, I want Zen Studios to get Game Room.
2629266	2636954	I want Microsoft to give that to Zen Studios because they seem to know how to do this whole microtransaction game within a game thing.
2637374	2639596	I don't know what Microsoft has planned for Game Room long term now.
2639696	2642419	If anything, they might just sweep it under the rug like they've been doing a lot of stuff.
2642799	2646501	But if they plan on keeping that going, I would love to see it go over there.
2647281	2652383	Even though I think that studio probably has no interest in anything but pinball, but you never know.
2652503	2653424	So that's really it.
2654664	2655565	That was it for my gaming week.
2657170	2660292	I don't really have anything else to say on that, so let's get into housekeeping tonight.
2660812	2663634	Join our Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2663654	2666135	We're also on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR.
2666715	2669697	I think we have a MySpace, but really, who uses MySpace anymore?
2670417	2671218	Is anyone on MySpace?
2671238	2671918	Any MySpace fans?
2671978	2672398	Didn't think so.
2673019	2674940	Let's get into some gaming news.
2675560	2676841	We'll start off tonight with Loki.
2676861	2679102	We're only, what, 50 minutes into the show, finally getting to gaming news?
2679162	2680383	I'm totally on MySpace.
2681283	2683985	Just kidding, I'm not on MySpace, because no one uses it.
2684765	2688471	I think anyone who's on Myspace just never deleted their profile two years ago.
2689071	2689772	Exactly.
2690674	2694719	No, actually some pretty interesting stuff going on.
2695640	2696702	Gran Turismo 5.
2697123	2699426	Yeah, it's supposed to be out this week, right?
2699886	2700147	Right?
2701112	2701352	No?
2701853	2702133	Yes?
2703774	2706457	It didn't end up coming out this week, and it's been delayed again.
2707337	2719728	Of course, they haven't really said when it's supposed to be coming out, other than just a few different comments based off of the producers of the game and what retailers are saying.
2720548	2724612	For example, the creator, Yamauchi,
2727694	2736037	Basically, it was telling the website, Japolik, that the discs were being stamped as we speak.
2737197	2743819	Which I can tell you right now is bullshit, that the game has not gone gold, and I don't believe it's being stamped right now.
2747020	2754852	Also, apparently retailers are listing that the game is going to have a past Christmas release date.
2755793	2761902	Some of them are showing a 1-1 release date or December 31st, which I can tell you right now is just a temporary date.
2762663	2763424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2784642	2785543	Just gotta wait longer.
2786583	2790405	The more this is going on, the more I'm kind of like forgetting about this game.
2790646	2791226	Exactly.
2792286	2792807	You know what I mean?
2792827	2795748	That's kind of sad because Gran Turismo is like a huge franchise and everything.
2796129	2798810	But the more this is going on, I'm just kind of like, oh, there's all this other stuff.
2798830	2803153	Remember when Gran Turismo 5 Prologue came out and it was supposed to be a taste of what the game was like?
2803373	2806134	And now it's not even close to what the game is like?
2806494	2807075	That's funny.
2807595	2813520	Remember when they had, was it Gran Turismo 5, like, what was it?
2813540	2815642	It was like Concept or something like that.
2815682	2820606	It was the free download that was on the PlayStation Network.
2821046	2821727	It was ridiculous.
2822328	2830635	SatelliteMinded says in our chatroom at chat.ownershuntradio.com, do Gran Theft, or sorry, I was going to say Gran Theft, Gran Turismo 5 delays count as news anymore?
2830655	2830695	No.
2832276	2839482	I think in this case, yes, because they're missing the holiday season, if this is all true, which is pretty damaging.
2839642	2841444	I mean, it is and it isn't.
2841484	2846348	I think we've shown through this last year that games can do very well, even if released after the holidays.
2847029	2850892	Case in point, Mass Effect 2 came out, what, like a week after the holidays?
2851893	2852494	And it did fine.
2853254	2858339	But still, to miss that holiday season, especially with such an epic, epic game, I think is newsworthy.
2858900	2859821	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2879958	2880278	I know.
2880518	2880839	I know.
2881279	2882120	Blowing my mind.
2882140	2883941	I may have to take a day off work for that one.
2884361	2884661	Really?
2885362	2885962	That big a deal?
2885982	2886503	I'm excited.
2886523	2888704	I don't even think I'm taking a day off for Cataclysm.
2890165	2890446	All right.
2890906	2893468	Anyhow, going to other Sony news.
2893948	2896430	Did you know that the Tester 2 started this week?
2898153	2923719	I did, and don't care The Tester 2, of course, you know, this is the sequel to The Tester 1 Which is Sony's original programming for PlayStation Network And, you know, it's been getting its share of crap And, you know, even though I myself am hazing The Tester 2 here on the show It's not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be It's just no better than, like, an average Bravo reality television show
2925185	2927487	But is that as far as Sony wants to go?
2928088	2950909	Possibly not, if you were to believe PlayStation Network director Susan Panico They want to go all the way That's right, she wants to go all the way Saying, quote, I hope five years from now we'll be winning Emmys for quality shows No, I'm sorry No one wins Emmys for reality shows It starts with a dream It starts with a dream, Loki
2951314	2951714	DarkSakura.com
2975603	2981145	I will give them props to the fact that they are also a movie production house.
2982266	2990889	They have the resources, I just don't see the tester as a good example of what can be done with those resources.
2991429	2992570	It all starts with a dream.
2992970	2993310	I'm sorry.
3010328	3011009	That would be awesome.
3039192	3043835	Spastinator PSN in our chatroom says, there's only one good thing about the tester too, Adrian Curry.
3043895	3044516	Need I say more?
3044856	3045136	Really?
3045196	3045656	She's in that?
3045676	3046617	She is a hot mess.
3047137	3049359	Like, that might make it actually worth watching.
3049379	3049879	I think she's a judge.
3049899	3050579	That bitch is a mess.
3051280	3052881	Oh, they don't have Hal Sparks this year or something?
3053501	3054282	They have her instead?
3054582	3055082	I think so.
3055502	3056043	Interesting.
3056243	3060045	Because that, oh man, she is, let's just say she was very pro Prop 19.
3061006	3062127	She was very sad, I'm sure.
3062187	3062747	That didn't pass.
3063067	3063507	Just saying.
3065028	3069010	Satellite Minded says Sony will win an Emmy for PSN shows when GT5 comes out.
3069090	3071451	Yeah, because I'm sure now she won't be able to do pot.
3072491	3074352	Yeah, that was the only thing stopping her.
3074592	3074932	Oh, yes.
3076112	3079193	That no vote really stopped everyone, I'm sure, California.
3079293	3079753	Way to go.
3080774	3081034	Anyhow.
3081853	3087520	You know, you're right, though, that Sony has the studio behind it to make this work if they want to.
3087620	3093747	It's just that this I don't really see as the real motivator to get things going.
3093807	3096269	But, you know, we'll see what happens.
3096530	3100794	What Sony should do is take some of the pilots that maybe don't work out very well or better yet.
3101335	3102837	Here's a great idea, Sony.
3104130	3107672	Take shows that get cancelled before their prime.
3108492	3110894	And if you want an example of this, just go to Fox.
3111014	3113435	Because Fox always loves to cancel things before their prime.
3114035	3117137	And get the rest of the episodes and put them up on PSN.
3117998	3123961	Especially, like, can you imagine if something like PlayStation Store had been around when Firefly was on TV?
3124281	3124941	Like, hear me out.
3125302	3127603	Like, I know there's Whedon nerds that listen to this show.
3128263	3155142	so imagine like Fox cancels Firefly but Sony is smart enough to know oh there was actually this really strong cult audience for the show somebody's already paid to make this show let's just buy the rights to put them on PlayStation Network and have it be ad supported and then that would just draw you know and then maybe it finally finds its audience in this on-demand network like that could be huge now I don't think Firefly was a Sony studio show I think I don't know Universal or yeah but
3155502	3183192	but anyway just take that idea and apply it to maybe a really good show that Sony might have had or here's an idea since you've got you know you like doing television programming and stuff like that make your own IPTV channels you know actually have some different channels of content on there that are exclusive to the PlayStation Network and say maybe you have to pay a $5 a month fee to access this stuff that would be kind of neat you know oh so Hulu
3185410	3186350	No, not necessarily.
3186711	3187991	That's an on-demand type thing.
3188031	3194414	I'm talking about actual content that's like a live network where you can tune in at a certain time and watch something.
3194434	3199317	Not, oh hey, I want to watch old episodes of this and go.
3200973	3204615	All right, well, we'll see what happens with Sony programming later on.
3204675	3206735	Maybe they'll announce an expansion at E3.
3206795	3207196	Who knows?
3208156	3214459	But I would expect that Xbox is going to announce a success for the 1 versus 100 first.
3214539	3215559	Oh, wait, they did.
3215579	3218020	And I don't think it came up anywhere on our show roll tonight.
3218040	3218640	Did you hear about this?
3218800	3220021	Just quickly, I've got to throw this out there.
3220281	3226984	There's a new game coming out for Xbox that is that whole 1 versus 100-esque type of thing, the massively multiplayer game.
3227744	3237229	it's a poker game which I'm kind of like sick of poker games too many of them does he really?
3238129	3255858	I mean there's an audience for it it's an easy game to learn it'll have an audience I'll try it once not interested unless it's strip poker and even then I probably wouldn't be interested and now with Kinect that's possible Kinect poker now you can Kinect in a whole new way DarkSakura what do you have for us?
3257364	3260445	Well, we have something regarding Apple.
3260545	3266347	They have filed a patent that looks like it's going to be an augmented reality game.
3267067	3275090	It has something on there for targeting and using a real-world interactive game environment.
3276050	3278711	And, yeah, from what it looks like on here, it's going to be so you can shoot people.
3280532	3281132	In the face.
3282438	3289221	Yeah, it even has a mention of a gun attachment for it.
3291202	3292742	I really don't know what they're doing.
3292782	3302346	I mean, it could be maybe laser tag, or it could be that they're just filing it so that no one else does it, or it could be, you know, a money shot game.
3303948	3313871	Sorry, I just can't help but think of that thing we played on the show a couple weeks ago from The Onion that was just the shoot people in the face over and over game and then it was like cute furry animals too.
3317192	3319833	Yeah, this won't be controversial at all if you can shoot your friends in the face.
3321753	3323214	Maybe it can be like Ink Blaster.
3324414	3325354	Right, right, red ink.
3325575	3328015	Yeah, red ink.
3328856	3329596	You got red on you.
3329856	3331916	They could also just be patenting this so no one else can.
3332417	3333457	That's what my thought was.
3333497	3333637	Yeah.
3336388	3339011	Anyhow, that's all I got to say on that.
3339392	3340913	So, other interesting things.
3341834	3353287	Apparently, with the new dashboard, and this is totally not unexpected, they are actually going to be implementing new features to try to stop piracy.
3355329	3355969	Unhackable.
3357830	3359610	Yeah.
3359830	3360290	Let me guess.
3360330	3363991	Some mucky muck up there came out and said that you can't pirate on this thing.
3365372	3366952	We have made this hack-proof.
3367252	3377595	I don't think anyone said anything about it, but basically they have a new series of checks that they do for disks, which I guess hackers are referring to as AP 2.5.
3379555	3383298	I guess that work in conjunction with security sectors embedded in the disk.
3383399	3390184	If the checks come back negative, the player receives a dirty disk error, and his or her console is flagged for permaban.
3391225	3405297	It says pirates, though, can hypothetically avoid these checks by not updating to the new firmware, and though this will prevent them from playing on Xbox Live, which kind of defeats the purpose of avoiding the permaban, it
3407395	3424644	Yes, apparently, one, if you're burning a copy of the game anyways, you could just delete the update on it, so that would bypass that, because not all games that have the new firmware attached with them actually require that firmware to run.
3426805	3433769	And also, if you have a JTAG console, you can just plain delete the update anyways, and that way you can avoid actually...
3434369	3438339	you know having to update your system of course well if you have a JTAG you can't update it anyways
3438686	3444391	Well, look, Microsoft has a right to protect their assets, and I get that and everything, but are they bragging about it?
3444431	3445612	Did they come out and say?
3445692	3445852	No.
3446432	3447293	Digital Foundry did.
3447573	3451616	Well, then, you know, it's to be expected in this case.
3452237	3460664	The only thing that gets me is when they come out and say, oh, well, this system, we put measures in this to make this unhackable, and it's going to do this and this.
3460924	3464207	That's just an open invitation for people to say, please hack me.
3464947	3465808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3487532	3489033	and then they can get past all those checks.
3489233	3490993	And replacement drives are only about $20.
3491033	3492354	Yeah, but that's a lot of work.
3492754	3495195	That's not a lot of work for someone that's really determined.
3495235	3497216	Well, yeah, but how many people are that determined?
3497776	3498056	I don't know.
3498076	3501698	I've spoofed a drive before because I've messed up flashing a firmware on there.
3502438	3503558	It's really simple to do.
3506039	3510481	But yeah, I mean, you'd really have to want to play burn games.
3512002	3512422	Interesting.
3513427	3518432	Well, you know, I'm sure we're going to continue to hear news like this as more of these firmware updates come out.
3518492	3521935	It's really no surprise that half the time new firmware updates are too dressed.
3521975	3523316	It's always a back and forth.
3524337	3529122	They'll figure out a way around it and they'll come out with something new and they'll figure out a way around that and so on and so forth.
3530002	3537407	All right, well, let's move on to something a little different, and this has to do with the iPhone slash iTouch slash iPad, the iOS family of games.
3537848	3540369	There's a brand new service from Capcom out there.
3540409	3543331	It's a free-to-play iPhone arcade app.
3543371	3544973	It's called Capcom Arcade.
3545413	3549756	It is free, and you can play Street Fighter II, Commando, Ghouls N' Ghosts in 1942.
3549976	3552338	Ooh, ah, but here's the catch.
3553118	3561324	It's just like Game Room in the sense where you can get tokens to play games for 99 cents or you can pay three bucks for unlimited access.
3562505	3566968	Or, here's the best part, you get three free plays per day.
3567548	3571791	So if you just want to download and play three times a day, free!
3572071	3573092	Yay, go get it.
3573292	3575273	What's the subbie from just changing the date on your phone?
3576974	3577635	I have no idea.
3578485	3581306	I'm not that desperate to play more Street Fighter 2.
3581626	3585668	I mean, I played that game until my fingers were bleeding back when I was like 12.
3586909	3593631	I'll play it once and I'll go, hee hee, this sure controls like ass on my iPhone, but it was fun to try.
3593651	3595552	That's really what it's going to be.
3596513	3600754	Because let's not forget, they make terrible controllers.
3601855	3606717	That's the one thing that's really stopping iOS from moving on is the lack of something tangible right now.
3608180	3608740	Exactly.
3609361	3612182	But hey, I'm all about free, even if it's just three times a day.
3612382	3615084	I'll get as much of that out as I can.
3615124	3616204	But where's Quiz and Dragons?
3617305	3618125	That's what I'm waiting for.
3621387	3622347	Keep room for updates.
3624468	3625089	Alright, moving on.
3625129	3626409	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3626429	3627970	We have release dates coming up right after this.
3628610	3629851	Classic Game of the Week, not that far away.
3630339	3639022	Well, this sounds really cool and something I'm actually thinking about participating in is that Capcom's forum has these contest rules.
3639102	3647846	Basically, until November 22nd, you can do your own artwork for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and if it basically wins...
3648426	3654668	Then you get an Xbox 360 and a couple of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and a framed print of your own work.
3655728	3656668	Make sure it's not dirty.
3657729	3663130	And your work gets to actually be in the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 art book.
3664691	3665331	That's pretty cool.
3666091	3670072	I mean, I don't think that my stuff is all that fantastic, but it'd still be fun to participate.
3672793	3675734	I guess if you have artistic talent, which won't be me.
3677967	3680894	When they do the voice actor thing, then I'll try, but for now...
3686718	3687639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3709457	3710177	Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC
3724671	3726893	There's a version for the Wii, but really isn't anyone going to play it.
3727153	3727794	And DS.
3729996	3736321	Yeah, I'm sure DS sells a lot of Call of Duty Black Ops.
3737202	3739463	Other fun things coming out this week, of course.
3743447	3745529	I know there's more Kinect games.
3747350	3748151	Oh, yay, more?
3748511	3749312	Yes, more.
3749772	3750793	No, actually...
3752845	3753646	I'll see here.
3754907	3756508	God, I hate the new site that they have here.
3760050	3762552	Well, you know, you could always prep these things in advance.
3763353	3763973	Of course not.
3763993	3765414	Just saying.
3765574	3766335	Let's see.
3766555	3771139	Let's talk about other things that are not necessarily Kinect games, because there's a lot of those, too.
3771159	3773500	We've got to mention all of them, because everybody wants to know.
3774741	3774841	Um...
3776062	3780284	Chuck E. Cheese's Playhouse, a crappy game for kids, and that's on Nintendo DS.
3780885	3783386	Noah's Ark, also on the Nintendo DS.
3783466	3785547	Chuck E. Cheese's Game Room on Nintendo DS.
3786748	3788208	Nickelodeon Fit on the Wii.
3789049	3790249	That's really for little kids.
3790890	3795372	Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, that's right, the one that's claymation that they have each year.
3795432	3796753	They based the game off that.
3796933	3798134	That's on the Wii and DS.
3798634	3802436	Family Feud, decades coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
3802916	3804798	What the hell is Family Feud Decades?
3804898	3808181	Is that like where you get Richard Dawson from the 70s?
3808281	3809162	No, no, no.
3809342	3810123	Ray Combs from the 80s?
3810143	3811264	It's much simpler than that.
3811324	3816108	You have families dressed up like different cliches of decades.
3816169	3818791	That is the cheapest cash-in I have ever heard in my life.
3820932	3842777	Monster Jam Path of Destruction on the Wii DS, Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and they actually do have bundles that include a steering wheel even one for the Playstation 3 but not for the move you'd be surprised to find out it's actually for the stupid DualShock 3 because I guess the game uses 6 axis steering
3843437	3844897	Just Dance Kids.
3845217	3847178	This is also another game for little kids.
3847378	3854540	It's Just Dance with the wheels on the bus go round and round and other things like music from the Wiggles and whatnot.
3854620	3859081	Definitely not something that our age demographic of listeners would be interested in.
3859901	3861961	Also, Karaoke Revolution Glee.
3862821	3864322	They have a bundle coming out on the Wii.
3864382	3865602	This game gives me nightmares.
3867831	3869152	Let's see here.
3869893	3871034	Honda Fever.
3872216	3876000	It's basically just a repackage of another game that came out that sucked.
3878222	3879544	Beyblade Metal Fusion.
3879584	3886131	I guess this is actually a series that's still on TV, but they have that game coming out on the Nintendo DS and the Wii.
3888118	3891102	Oh, and I guess Monster Jam Path of Destruction came out on PSP as well.
3891963	3894406	This has got to be the worst game I've ever seen.
3895167	3897530	Reload Target Down for the Nintendo Wii.
3897730	3900353	It is a game where you test fire guns.
3901335	3901795	That's right.
3901915	3902536	It's a game.
3902836	3904118	You don't shoot people.
3904559	3906421	You target shoot with guns.
3906761	3912428	Style Lab Fashion Design Hasbro Family Game Night Challenge Me Brain Puzzles 2 Nintendo DS
3927765	3931568	Remington Super Slam Hunting North America on the Wii.
3931588	3935091	Okay, let's see here.
3935171	3938073	Remington Super Slam Hunting Africa on the Wii.
3939274	3943538	My Sims Collection with both My Sims Racing and I believe just My Sims.
3944618	3947701	Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 on the Wii finally coming out now.
3948862	3953045	Rune Factory 3 of A Fantasy Harvest Moon on the Nintendo DS.
3953085	3953205	Okay.
3954806	3957227	Apparently they're doing an ESA game pack.
3957307	3959547	This is something that they do every year.
3960047	3964449	Usually a certain game manufacturer will actually put out a collection of stuff.
3965069	3981813	This one comes with Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, Tomb Raider, and Mercenaries 2 for $29.99 and all the proceeds I believe go to charity for that to the ESA if you want to support that and some really old ass games.
3982713	3988295	SingStar Dance, a very terrible add-on to the SingStar series.
3988755	3989896	That is on the PlayStation 3.
3989936	3992937	The Fight lights out.
3993077	3994637	Seriously, do not buy this game.
3994878	3995738	It was terrible.
3995798	3997018	It's got horrible reviews.
3997639	3998819	Really do not need this game.
3999119	4001120	The Sly Collection, that's coming out on PlayStation 3.
4001600	4008522	It's a recreation of, or I guess, HD versions of the old Sly Cooper games, and the third one's actually in 3D as well.
4010643	4011224	Ah, yes.
4011604	4014446	Man, there's a ton of crap coming out.
4015006	4017387	Digging for Dinosaur on Nintendo DS.
4017668	4019569	Zuzu Pets has some more games coming out.
4020129	4021630	The Kungzoo on Nintendo DS.
4022931	4025472	I'm just going to skip past a bunch of this crap.
4025913	4028554	I guess Harvest Moon is being re-released on Nintendo DS.
4029495	4029835	Really?
4030315	4035118	Well, same with... They're doing a lot of re-releases on stuff.
4035138	4036359	Rune Factory 2 is coming out.
4036419	4037299	They're re-releasing that.
4037380	4038500	I think there's probably a price drop.
4038540	4039341	Same with the first one.
4040282	4041523	Releasing all that stuff.
4041843	4049112	The new Xbox controller with that wonderful fixed D-pad is now coming out this week for $65 if you really want to buy that.
4050678	4078287	and then a few things one week from today Mario vs. Donkey Kong Miniland Mayhem coming out on Nintendo DS and then also one week from today will be the potential for a new Mario Paint U-Draw tablet with U-Draw Studios will be coming out and then of course the two games that go along with that Dude's Big Adventure and Pictionary and of course that's that tablet thing that looked like the Mario Paint type pen tablet thing
4078928	4081296	and then of course Pictionary is also on Nintendo DS.
4081577	4081979	And that's it.
4083544	4084145	Finally, jeez.
4084205	4085606	Sorry, there's a lot of crap going on.
4085626	4086527	Sorry, no, I know it's holidays.
4086547	4087868	And emphasis on crap.
4088388	4089970	Let's go to Japan and see what's coming out over there.
4090050	4093513	On the Xbox 360, Forza Motorsport 3 on November 11th.
4093633	4094814	This is the Ultimate Edition, by the way.
4095555	4100999	Mushihima-sama Futari Version 1.5 is the Platinum Collection.
4101039	4101780	Why do you want this so bad?
4101820	4102861	This is a shooter game, isn't it?
4102941	4104302	It is, and it's a really cool shooter.
4105543	4108005	And there's also the iPhone version adventure game coming out.
4108846	4113351	Also, Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2, Mafia 2, and Scared 2 Fallen Angel.
4113451	4114513	Also getting a price reduction.
4114553	4116114	Those are all on the Xbox 360 this week.
4116815	4117296	What did I say?
4117616	4117876	Scared.
4118337	4118777	Oh, my bad.
4118957	4119678	Yeah, Sacred 2.
4120679	4122421	I like a game called Scared 2.
4122962	4123302	Scared 2.
4125244	4128348	PlayStation 3 has Biohazard 5 Alternative Edition.
4128388	4129970	That would be Resident Evil 5 with the move.
4130890	4142598	Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2, Mafia 2, Scared 2, Fallen Angel, Shinsengoku Musou Online, Soten Ranbu comes out this week as well on the PlayStation 3.
4142638	4152404	This is the online version of the one where you kill everything and smash the button.
4152764	4153784	There's like seven of those games.
4153804	4154845	Dynasty Warriors, is that it?
4155265	4156946	It's that, but online.

4189492	4191953	Speaking of things that we don't care about.
4192013	4198136	PlayStation 2 gets one game this week called Shinkyoku Sokai Polyphonica After School.
4199076	4200957	I can only guess what this game is going to be about.
4201017	4201677	I'll give you a hint.
4201737	4204259	There's a girl in a school outfit on the cover.

4218991	4222112	Caru Batake de Tsukamete Portable Caru Batake de Tsukamete Portable
4247999	4264081	and it actually is not that although it looks like this game stars plenty of bukkake people that you'd probably want to see in a bukkake porn I'm just kidding they're kids that's gross alright what's wrong with you what's wrong with you how about it
4265111	4285566	Call of Duty Black Ops Dance Central, Dance Paradise, Dance Evolution, Dance Masters, Fighters Uncaged, Game Party In Motion, The Connect, Connect Adventures, Connect Joyride, Connect Sports, Connectimals, Motion Sports, Connect Adventures, Your Shape Fitness Evolved,

4296093	4296433	That's it.
4297173	4298294	That's all I'm going to say anyway.
4299975	4301636	See, I like how you filter the crap out.
4302897	4305559	I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're talking about.
4307739	4308499	I'm just messing with you.
4309220	4310860	Alright, let's move on.
4310880	4313361	A couple more stories in the Classic Game of the Week.
4314382	4315942	I'm going to filter all the crap out.
4316143	4318123	I'll just mention one game the next time.
4318143	4318424	Stop.
4318784	4322025	Sorry, this week only comes out when we're going to filter all the crap.
4322245	4323266	It is Chuck E. Cheese.
4323286	4324486	That is the only game coming out this week.
4324926	4334130	Now, Xbox Live Indie Games has disappeared off the main marketplace menu and you actually have to dig for it now.
4334530	4336031	It's in specialty shops.
4336371	4338472	By the way, it's not that hard to find, you guys.
4338793	4339273	I know.
4339653	4343456	It is a couple menus deep, but it's not impossible to find.
4343876	4345237	But I understand why people are pissed.
4345257	4345917	Sorry, I'll shut up.
4345977	4349060	Yeah, so it is now under Specialty Shops.
4349080	4352982	Of course, Avatar Marketplace being the first spot on there.
4353002	4354763	But Indie Games is a close second.
4355384	4366171	And, of course, Xbox Live Indie Game Creators are bummed over the fact that the menu has been slightly hidden, if you will.
4366852	4379010	and I don't know it's just they kind of feel like they're being brushed off I guess I don't think it's that big a deal to be honest
4380205	4381526	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4398522	4399023	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4417601	4425143	Imagine if they had something like Windows Media Player with a store in it where it wasn't just the music and movies, but things that you could download to your Xbox.
4425544	4429725	Or maybe like when you download a movie, it would download to your PC and your Xbox.
4430685	4435027	But within that, they could do like this whole indie games thing, kind of like iTunes does.
4435087	4435967	Like, I don't know.
4436547	4438328	I could kind of see that being kind of neat.
4439168	4439308	Yeah.
4441368	4442008	at the same time.
4442828	4443769	Maybe it's too much work.
4443909	4445529	Maybe they're trying to sell this whole Kinect thing.
4445849	4448490	And they haven't opened up Kinect to indie developers yet, have they?
4449410	4450711	Probably won't for a long time.
4451391	4452551	I don't remember if they have or not.
4452831	4458133	I think maybe Xbox Live Arcade, but not, I don't know.
4458933	4460374	Ross Steel UT is in our chat room.
4460414	4460814	Is it really?
4461014	4462454	Ross Steel UT, I haven't seen him in like two years.
4463074	4466215	The indie games aren't any less easy to find than they were before.
4466275	4467236	They're just butthurt.
4467876	4468176	Well...
4469986	4498287	yeah I mean I didn't find them particularly hard to find and I think again if you sell yourself on the web you'll be fine I can understand though where the developers are feeling a little bit unloved but keep in mind there's a lot of things at Microsoft right now being unloved Game Room's another one everything's all about the Kinect Kinect Kinect Kinect Kinect Kinect maybe after the holidays they can focus on that other stuff again but we'll see although I somehow wouldn't be holding my breath
4500600	4504542	Something you know is inevitable, though, and is going to happen is a Bejeweled 3.
4504643	4509185	That's right, Bejeweled 1 and Bejeweled 2 are some of the biggest freaking games ever made.
4509566	4512247	Bejeweled 3 is coming out on December 7th.
4512507	4513548	And my wife didn't care.
4514268	4514549	What?
4515169	4516510	I thought Bejeweled was the only game she plays.
4516530	4518251	She's like, what are they going to add to it?
4518271	4520572	I'm like, well, they have this new poker mode thing.
4520592	4521333	She's like, that's dumb.
4521989	4523069	Well, wait until she tries.
4523349	4536972	There are also, just so you know, new Quest and Zen modes are coming to the game, unlockable secret game variants, and there's also supposed to be smoother gameplay and new music and sound.
4536992	4549934	$20 if you want to get it through PopCap.com, but I bet you'll have to wait not even six months and it'll be out on iPhone and Xbox Live and PlayStation Network and pretty much anything with a controller or touchscreen.
4550254	4550934	We'll have Bejeweled 3.
4552014	4552735	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4579850	4590256	by the way, Zuma Blitz is supposed to be coming out very soon as well too I think that's in beta right now so lots of new games coming out of Pop Crack what about Plants vs. Zombie Blitz?
4591436	4603003	I guess I shouldn't hold my breath on that one hey, it's the time of the show where we take a stroll down memory lane and allow Dark Sakura to take the reins for a little bit oh, we must be crazy
4604286	4607870	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4629986	4634492	The classic game of the week is Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Superheroes.
4634972	4637015	Ooh, ah.
4637636	4642522	Because I got a big excited girl boner for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 today.
4642742	4643643	A bit of Ladywood.
4644144	4644384	Yes.
4644885	4647448	So we have to start off with the characters that came out of it.
4649270	4651352	This is my favorite music in the game, for the record.
4655215	4662922	So yes, the game is the fifth of the Marvel Comics licensed fighting games.
4663782	4671189	This one actually, instead of being just an X-Men vs. or Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, this goes all over the place.
4672389	4681875	and you have to basically get all of these people against Onslaught who I thought was actually kind of a retarded character in the comics but that's just me.
4682616	4698466	So moving forward we have this one is where you actually have a random assist character that you start off with bringing one of your teammates in which I think they've gotten rid of for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and
4702196	4706541	Then, you know, there were also ways that you could select who your little bonus person was.
4707422	4710445	And then you also had duo team attacks.
4710726	4711907	This music is awesome, too.
4712848	4713809	It's the theme of Strider 3.
4719201	4721462	He's not in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so far.
4721942	4722183	Yet.
4723203	4723583	So far.
4723663	4724284	I said so far.
4724624	4725244	I thought he was.
4725404	4726905	I was like, why not?
4727085	4728946	But no, not yet.
4729486	4744354	So anyway, the different characters in this one is you had Spider-Man, Captain America, Hulk, Wolverine, Venom, Gambit, War Machine, Gold War Machine, Red Venom, Orange Hulk, and Onslaught on the Marvel side.
4745614	4755381	and on Capcom you had Ryu Chun-Li, Zangief, Mega Man, Jin, Morrigan, Strider Hero, Captain Commando, Roll.
4756221	4757382	You should play Roll's music now.
4758683	4760764	Lilith or Shadow Lady.
4760984	4763626	I love Roll had singy-songy music.
4766488	4766828	As in his...
4776735	4796041	As far as your special partners, you've got Unknown Soldier, Lu and Siva, Saki Omokane, Pure and Fur, Psylocke, Michelle Hart, Iceman, Arthur, Tonpoo, Juggernaut, Devilot, Thor, Magneto, US Agent, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Anita, Jubilee, Rogue, Shadow, and Sentinel.
4797762	4798862	At least gave the nods over.
4798882	4800843	Dude, Tonpoo, that was just cool.
4800943	4801323	I laughed.
4802043	4812730	Um, at any rate, there is a perfect version that came out on Dreamcast in 1999, and it had cross-fever mode, so you could have four players play simultaneously.
4813591	4817774	Um, there was a version that came out on the PlayStation, which is the EX edition in Japan.
4818834	4845903	but it didn't have the tag team gameplay and it didn't have the secondary characters except just for assists but it did have the crossover you could play a tag team with identical teams which was kind of stupid but it did allow you to play as Onslaught and if you beat the game with well that's I think if you beat the game with Mega Man or something
4847128	4850950	And yeah, the soundtrack came out, which I've got the soundtrack, and it is amazing.
4851891	4855813	And it was great, and it opened the door for all this other funness.
4857894	4862456	Of course, Dan got me hooked on playing with Strider New Year.
4863056	4863956	This is other good music.
4869999	4871100	Everyone should recognize that.
4871522	4872743	Yep, the theme of Mega Man.
4873504	4875406	It was a lot of fun.
4875806	4877007	It's a great game.
4878088	4881352	Definitely one worth having on the Dreamcast because it was perfect.
4882933	4884214	Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is really good.
4884234	4890561	I'm looking forward to Marvel vs. Capcom 3, but I had to start it with somewhere and I think this is a good place to do it.
4891582	4892623	It's as good of a place as any.
4893043	4893984	Yep, so that's it.
4894004	4895045	That's your classic game of the week.
4895499	4900463	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Marvel vs. Capcom 1.
4901444	4907908	Back before, there was all these other sequels, and now this new fancy one.
4907928	4920838	Although, I gotta say, the videos I was looking at online for the new one, and even seeing it at E3, although it looks like it's come a long way, just even in the videos I've been seeing online, pretty awesome, gotta say.
4921338	4921899	Looking forward to it.
4922523	4923344	All right, we're going to take a break.
4923384	4924685	We'll be right back, though, guys.
4924725	4925405	Stay tuned.
4925626	4927527	We have plenty more show to come.
4927567	4930670	We got our rapid-fire news, of which there's a lot, since we have to make up for last week.
4931030	4933933	We're also going to talk a little more about that whole Kinect hacking stuff.
4933953	4935374	We have another story on that coming up in a minute.
4935694	4940678	We're going to talk about Fable 3 and Saints Row as well on the Xbox Live Arcade.
4940979	4941839	So don't go anywhere, guys.
4941879	4945983	We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4947495	4950137	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4950177	4955281	We are taping the 388th episode of our show live on this November the 7th of 2010.
4957122	4963326	We've been talking a little bit in Part A tonight about the new Kinect obviously is out and we've all had a chance to get our hands on it.
4963607	4967049	Which is weird because I still have yet to really play PlayStation Move outside of E3.
4967129	4971292	But Loki, you've gotten a chance to get your hands on both at this point now.
4971752	4972313	What do you think...
4972893	4974934	Both are going to offer us in a year's time.
4976435	4982577	The move, I think, is going to pretty much be what you see right now with the Nintendo Wii.
4982837	4988860	The only difference being that since they do have the camera in there, they can do some of the augmented reality stuff, which is actually pretty cool with it.
4989840	5014012	um I don't think it's really that different and they do um I don't know they have more of a setup now where they're going to kind of use it with more of their hardcore games I guess because like Killzone 3 is already going to have that SOCOM 4 they've got support for it so it'll be interesting to see how they implement that stuff or if you know it's even going to be necessary or you know you're going to be able to play as well with it
5014712	5030326	and then of course the Kinect it's hard to say how that's going to really I think there's a lot more potential with the Kinect because they can pretty much do whatever they want with no controller gaming but then they can also if they wanted to and they've said it before they're like
5031067	5036432	You know we can have this so that it works with you playing, not using the controller, right?
5036692	5039494	You know, the complaints, oh, there's no buttons and stuff.
5039514	5046340	It's like, well, who says that we can't do that or put out another controller later or, you know, whatever.
5046380	5052926	I mean, so there, it's, I think there's a lot more creative freedom with the Kinect than there is with the Move.
5054224	5063948	What do you think this says or is going to do anyway about the possible Xbox 720, the PlayStation 4, the Wii 2, and obviously all these names are hypothetical.
5064328	5070030	I don't know, but if you notice, and I'm not sure if this is necessarily because Microsoft's spending more money on advertising.
5070570	5072812	because they are spending a lot of money on advertising.
5073213	5082121	But have you noticed, like, with the whole Kinect stuff, there's been a lot bigger of a splash with the Kinect stuff as far as, like, all the, you know, talk shows and stuff like that.
5082141	5082882	Oh, absolutely.
5083042	5083803	Then there was the movie.
5083823	5085184	The movie just, like, came out and, like,
5085644	5086825	It's here, guys.
5087125	5088026	They had commercials.
5088466	5093789	That's mostly of what you've seen for the move and targeted commercials during things like South Park.
5093969	5095831	You'd always see a commercial for the move.
5096151	5096831	Things of that sort.
5097111	5108719	But yeah, definitely the Kinect is definitely trying to go that Nintendo route of being on Ellen, being on the news, doing the whole Times Square thing that they did.
5108739	5110440	It's going to be very interesting.
5110760	5110960	Yeah.
5111000	5123276	Of course, Nintendo gets to go through this whole hub-a-loo again with a 3DS because that's going to be another big thing that, you know, they'll parade that out on the Ellen show too and she'll go like, wow, it's like I could really see 3D guys, you know, and the whole thing.
5124377	5125138	Some corny joke.
5125218	5125919	Ooh, let's dance.
5126420	5126680	You know.
5127181	5127381	Yeah.
5127641	5128382	That'll be what happens.
5129143	5129263	So.
5131138	5134381	Uh, go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
5134621	5137563	Actdeft says, I think the next Wii will be a Super Wii.
5138423	5139664	It's certainly a possibility.
5139724	5146749	I mean, that might be a silly idea, but, you know, the Wii has that recognition, just like Nintendo had back in the day as a system.
5147069	5148250	And then there was the Super NES.
5148790	5151692	You know, that whole Wii HD, everyone likes to theorize about it.
5152513	5154894	Uh, and Frisbee follows that up with, and then the Wii 64.
5155034	5158637	Uh, Ross Steel UT says, the Kinect is more novel than the Move.
5158697	5159297	Let's be real.
5160018	5160338	You agree?
5161659	5162139	I think so.
5162800	5168483	And the other thing, like I've said... Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I think it's more something we haven't seen before.
5169164	5170205	I mean, it is and it isn't.
5170425	5173087	It feels like more of an evolution than the move does.
5173547	5179331	Although, the technology behind the move sounds pretty cool compared to what we've seen on the Wii.
5179371	5181172	We just don't see a lot of that in motion yet.
5181192	5184614	But this whole augmented reality and all the stuff you talk about makes me very excited.
5184915	5185715	The potential.
5186336	5187316	And that's the other thing too.
5187376	5188897	The augmented reality stuff...
5190178	5195800	is possible with the Kinect.
5195940	5196720	I mean, who's to say?
5196740	5198040	Because it can track your body.
5198641	5207523	Who's to say you can't, I don't know, even just have a game come out and have something as simple as you hold up a piece of cardboard and there you go.
5207683	5209964	I mean, it just has to have something like a target for it.
5210284	5212945	And it basically uses the sensors that are in the
5213625	5216647	You know, move controller and the orb to track that.
5216987	5221590	So, you... There's potential they could do all the same stuff.
5222330	5233357	And, you know, it has a good, you know... It can track you really well, as we saw with, you know, Dance Masters, where it can do a literal... Almost like a green screen of myself while I'm playing the game.
5233797	5242322	Not that I really want to see that, because that's very... I feel like an idiot already, and looking at myself playing the game, it's just like...
5242822	5243763	Why are you doing this?
5245264	5246684	Let me ask Jamie here for a minute.
5246704	5249446	I don't mean to take you away from our lovely chatters.
5249586	5251227	The chatroom at chat.orange.com.
5251527	5257491	But I know you don't get as into the new stuff, I think, as you have the classics.
5257851	5260333	You definitely, the most room in your heart is for the classic games.
5260813	5265356	What do you think about this new, I mean, certainly this is technology we never really saw before in the classic gaming world.
5265656	5272340	What do you think about the Kinect and the Move and all this and its potential impact on gaming?
5272648	5275229	I think the move looks like a sex toy, so I'm completely not interested.
5276969	5277609	Connect, I like.
5278690	5279210	I really do.
5279350	5288812	I think that it combines everything that they were trying to do with the move and with the eye toy, except it doesn't write.
5290213	5295274	And it definitely gives you more of that virtual environment feel to your games.
5295394	5296795	That, I think, is great.
5296935	5297635	I think that...
5299836	5300977	I can see it going two ways.
5301057	5306463	I can think we're going to get more and more and more like that and it'll be great or it will wear off after a while.
5306503	5311027	The novelty will wear off and people want to sit back on their couches with their controllers in their hands.
5311968	5314370	I like half agree with DarkSakura.
5314410	5314731	I kind of...
5315311	5318373	The Kinect, there's some things about it that strike me as gimmicky too.
5318553	5324496	I mean, and I think it's that we haven't really seen its full potential yet, whereas at least Sony's kind of like throwing these things out there.
5324536	5330839	Like, I don't write off the move quite as fast, but I will say right now, there's nothing I really want on the move.
5331039	5334581	There's nothing the move is doing for me and the type of games I like right now.
5335321	5337543	There's a lot of possibilities for things they can do.
5337563	5343209	Remember the whole head tracking demo that we saw with the Wii where they have the guy wearing the Wii remote?
5343329	5345831	You can do that with the Kinect because it tracks your head.
5347052	5349294	They can do that kind of stuff for first-person shooters.
5349314	5351996	That's why I was saying that it's not necessarily...
5352737	5368529	you don't have to have a game where you're just moving around like crazy they could just have it where they track your head you're doing all your movements and stuff on the controller and you can still be slightly more immersed in the game and it can be an optional feature which is kind of cool you can bring the mocap games home yeah
5368999	5376369	I'm really interested to see what next year's E3 is going to be because at next year's E3, all of this is going to be the norm.
5376430	5383960	The 3DS is going to be out by next E3 and all the rumors about the March release date or what have you, but it'll be out before June.
5384180	5384701	That's a given.
5385442	5388425	All of this stuff is now going to be the norm at NextE3.
5388585	5389566	Move is now out.
5389646	5390907	Connect is now out.
5390947	5391848	3DS is now out.
5392188	5397613	And it's going to be really interesting because the NextE3 is now going to be all about, okay, now what are you going to do with this?
5397874	5401997	Now that it's out, what have you come up with in the past year for how to use this technology?
5402057	5403619	It's going to be a very interesting show.
5403659	5405080	I'm really excited about it.
5405701	5407162	Even though it's like, what, nine months away?
5407182	5407863	Yeah.
5408243	5409144	I want to go this year.
5409164	5409705	Yeah.
5410586	5412288	Hopefully we can make it all work for us.
5413229	5413510	Alright.
5414351	5422321	But, you know, I was just thinking, I still, if you put both in front of me and said pick which one you want for free, I'd grab the Kinect.
5424235	5430320	I think me too, but only because it goes back to the rule of the system is only as good as the games that are on it.
5431300	5436364	And I wouldn't write the move off yet, because a year from now, we might be looking at the opposite.
5438426	5439647	That's just kind of what I see.
5439767	5444491	I'm not sure I really see where Kinect is going, but maybe I'll be proven wrong at the next E3.
5444551	5451076	I think, if anything, if the whole point of releasing these new motion systems were to capture...
5451676	5456758	The new audience that they're looking for, the more casual audience, I think that Kinect has done a better job of that.
5457158	5458379	Or at least it seems like it.
5458439	5461040	Because the move, I don't think a lot of people care.
5461760	5466362	And that's too bad, because it's not a bad piece of hardware, it's just not...
5467502	5477527	It's just slightly better, and yeah, granted the hardware is better, so you can do better looking games, but it's not completely different.
5477587	5482329	Whereas I would say the Kinect is completely different than what they're doing with the Wii and the PlayStation 3.
5482889	5484030	It is separate.
5486052	5491355	Well, I think one thing to consider as far as new hardware goes, I don't think it came up anywhere else in our show role, but something that's been coming up.
5491796	5498040	This was a lot the week we were out, but were those rumors of the PSP phone and some of the screenshots that showed up and all that.
5498120	5502443	So if this new PSP evolution is going to be shown at E3, it could be interesting.
5502843	5509007	But I don't think it's going to be anything outside of this whole motion gaming stuff and what we're talking about here.
5509707	5510308	But we'll see.
5511095	5516178	Anyhow, let's move on into some rapid fire news and some of the quick stories we have for you now.
5516198	5517799	We have a lot since we had a week off.
5517939	5519600	So, Loki, we're going to start with you with a quick news.
5520240	5520440	Yes.
5521140	5521481	Oh, sorry.
5521521	5522161	Twitter topics.
5522201	5522821	Get them in quick.
5522841	5523862	You have about two more minutes.
5524710	5524870	Yes.
5525770	5528511	So anyways, some interesting stuff going on.
5529051	5535533	Of course, we were talking a little bit about Dance Central and Harmonix being the ones that like to support download content.
5535553	5538593	They had some download content day one, whether you like that or not.
5539654	5543834	New songs that are coming out for Dance Central are going to run you $299 or $240 Microsoft points each.
5546115	5546896	and Sean Paul's Temperature.
5546956	5552284	And I guess those are all available now and hopefully we'll see some more download content next week.
5562978	5563678	Let's see here.
5563838	5569640	It didn't really say if the same moves are in there or if they're recycled or whatever.
5571541	5572441	But I think it's kind of neat.
5572461	5579823	I really wish that the game had kind of a routine editor because they could easily do that with the flashcards and stuff they have on there.
5581483	5583164	Can anyone say the sequel?
5583911	5584131	Yeah.
5585312	5588433	Of course, Black Friday is not too far away.
5588934	5591475	And with Black Friday, of course, the ads will leak out.
5591795	5597198	The first one to leak out with gaming-related information, of course, would be from Sears.
5597939	5604522	And they had some new bundles and stuff for the holidays and some new interesting colors for different things.
5604562	5609385	For example, the limited edition red and green DSi bundles for $150, which include Mario Party DS.
5612567	5622354	They've got a 160 gigabyte PlayStation 3 bundle for $300, which includes Uncharted 2 and a Blu-ray of the new movie Karate Kid.
5623395	5627098	PSP... What a deal.
5627158	5629540	The PSP 3000, well, I think those two games are free.
5630000	5632902	No, just the whole Karate Kid Blu-ray.
5633803	5634804	It's not a bad movie, I liked it.
5636384	5637485	I just refuse to see it.
5637685	5639685	I'm being stuck up for no reason.
5639825	5640706	It was good, okay.
5641286	5644307	The PSP 3000 bundle for $130, which includes LittleBigPlanet and UMD of the Karate Kid.
5644347	5646208	4GB Xbox 360 bundle for $200, which includes Halo Reach.
5646248	5646988	That's not bad.
5656972	5661236	Um, they had $10 off of a standard, I guess, Wii bundle.
5661917	5671707	And then, um, also they're going to be doing, um, discounts on different games like, uh, Medal of Honor, Fable 3, Halo Reach, all will be available for $40.
5671747	5671787	Um...
5675211	5692445	which is pretty awesome and actually this is kind of cool one of the games that's being marked down to $40 which will be just coming out about around that time Need for Speed Hot Pursuit so if you're interested in that game which you should be because it's by Criterion and they do really awesome racing games you should definitely check it out
5694403	5699848	I'm just saying, Loki, that of the Smith kids, I think Willow is more talented because she whips her hair back and forth.
5700869	5701229	I don't know.
5701249	5702350	The movie was not bad.
5702370	5702810	I liked it.
5702830	5703451	Whatever you say.
5703551	5704332	I enjoyed the movie a lot.
5704352	5705273	Isn't it the Kung Fu Kid?
5706153	5706734	Yes, it is.
5707795	5708916	It is the Kung Fu Kid.
5708936	5710537	Just saying.
5711178	5712999	They think we're dumb, so whatever.
5715525	5721787	Alright, and then of course, with that, there's some new Xbox demos that came out on the Marketplace this week.
5722107	5725668	Rock Band 3, which is pretty awesome, so you can check out a few songs from that.
5726229	5733771	Apache Air Assault, which is a helicopter attack game that's coming out on the 360 and PS3 in, I believe, next week or so.
5735131	5740033	And then, the most retarded addition to that would be Joyride, which...
5741093	5747576	If you have the Kinect, you'll realize that there is already a demo for Joyride on the disc of Kinect Adventures.
5748176	5751198	Why you would need to download an additional demo is beyond me.
5753687	5754608	Have at it, I guess.
5755929	5758251	But yeah, definitely check out those demos if you haven't yet.
5758991	5766397	Dance Central, Joyride, Your Shape Fitness, and yeah, I believe that was it on there.
5766437	5768799	But hey, three games you can check out for free.
5769019	5771541	Because I didn't notice that right away, and it said other games.
5771581	5772681	I'm like, other Kinect games?
5772922	5773262	What's that?
5773282	5775023	I'm like, oh, there's demos on here?
5775043	5776024	Awesome!
5777325	5778206	Oh my gosh!
5780193	5808679	so yeah check that out and then finally I don't know this is kind of ridiculous but apparently with the Wii version of the Michael Jackson the experience game you're going to get the jewel studded white glove to play the game with I guess so that you can feel more like Michael Jackson is it possible to think something is lame and yet totally awesome at the same time like this is totally awesomely lame
5811810	5813191	It's so bad, it's good.
5813811	5816833	It's bad, it's bad, it's really, really bad.
5818354	5818894	You know it.
5823557	5827539	Oh, what I would pay to see Loki modeling one of these Michael Jackson gloves.
5829160	5831322	I may have to get the game when it comes out for the Connect.
5831382	5833543	I gotta say, it actually looks kind of awesome.
5833803	5839006	Let's face it, Michael Jackson had some badass songs, and you know there's gonna be good dances.
5839066	5839647	It's just...
5840347	5844268	Just Dance with Michael Jackson songs and with optional karaoke.
5844648	5847789	I don't give a shit about the optional karaoke, but I think that would be awesome.
5847929	5849470	I fucking love Michael Jackson's stuff.
5849570	5851930	I don't care what people say that he did or did not do.
5852651	5854451	He was an awesome music artist.
5854511	5855472	I'm with you.
5855512	5856052	I agree.
5856072	5858112	Just ignore all the other stuff.
5858132	5859973	He has some new songs coming out, apparently.
5860413	5889842	their rumors are saying that there's a sound like doing some of them but who gives a fuck everything that's been going on with like Tupac and Biggie when they were you know gone before their time and yet it seems like Tupac is still releasing a new album every other year from some shit they dig up expect it to be even worse with Michael Jackson like there will be a new album every year for as long as you're alive and then there will soon be the rumors about he never really died they fake the death and the body that came out of the house wasn't really him and
5890462	5919931	and all this stuff he did it to escape his personal problems even though his kids were up there on stage crying and two more songs apparently have been announced for the game one of which is my wife's absolute favorite Michael Jackson song one I kind of like, Speed Demon and Dirty Diana Dirty Diana her absolute favorite song that's one of my favorites too you know what, my favorite actually isn't one of his dancey ones Man in the Mirror
5920575	5921241	She's out of my life.
5921948	5922412	Interesting.
5925259	5929781	Anyhow, we need to have a whole Michael Jackson The Game launch party.
5929821	5933022	But I just don't think everyone else would be as into it.
5933062	5934682	I just don't want to get in on the weed.
5934903	5939004	I think the generation after us, too, which makes up a lot of our listeners.
5939724	5942025	They have terrible taste in music, okay?
5942485	5947267	They weren't around when it was about Michael Jackson on MTV.
5947347	5948087	You know what I mean?
5948648	5950908	Like, we literally grew up with him.
5951429	5951749	You know?
5952509	5953170	This is different.
5953871	5956496	I remember when Thriller was on every hour.
5956756	5958178	Well, he and my mom were the same age.
5958759	5959120	Oh, wow.
5959380	5966271	So, you know, I went through all of her old stuff and I grew up with the whole thing.
5968107	5971012	Alright, anyhow, let's move on and talk about other gaming news.
5971873	5972654	You Don't Know Jack.
5972835	5975699	Oh god, I love this game and I'm so excited it's making a comeback.
5975719	5980126	Because they did kind of burn that series into the ground.
5980186	5982790	Like there was all these You Don't Know Jack games back in the day.
5982810	5984332	You Don't Know Jack, The Ride, and all this stuff.
5984753	5985494	Those are actually kind of cool.
5985895	5985975	But
