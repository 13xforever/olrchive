00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, November 28th, 2010, BBC programming comes to video game consoles courtesy of PlayStation

00:20.000 --> 00:25.120
Network, could indie games soon feature the Kinect, and another musician sues the makers

00:25.120 --> 00:31.920
of Guitar Hero.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.240
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.240 --> 00:39.500
Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.500 --> 00:44.380
It is episode number 391 for November 28th of 2010.

00:44.380 --> 00:45.380
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:45.380 --> 00:49.560
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts, the one and only

00:49.560 --> 00:52.120
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.560
I had balls.

00:53.560 --> 00:57.280
Well, we want to go there this early in the show.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.680
They were meaty and tangy.

00:59.680 --> 01:00.680
You're talking about meatballs.

01:00.680 --> 01:01.680
Yeah, barbecue meatballs.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.000
Where did you get some barbecue meatballs?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
From my husband.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I ate his balls.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.080
You got to eat his balls.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.040
You wouldn't even let me lick his balls.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
You can lick them.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
There's some left.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
Okay, good.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.040
I'll lick them later.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.040
He's got a lot of balls.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
All right.

01:15.040 --> 01:19.360
Anyway, let's also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.360
Hello.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.800
I need to ask if you have any interest in licking Dan's balls.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.960
No, I'm quite full on eating... was it garlic parmesan twists?

01:27.960 --> 01:29.920
You're downing the sticks over there, I see.

01:29.920 --> 01:30.920
No interest in the balls.

01:30.920 --> 01:31.920
That's fine.

01:31.920 --> 01:32.920
They're twists, okay?

01:32.920 --> 01:33.920
They're not sticks.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.040
How is your parmesan twists?

01:36.040 --> 01:37.040
They're okay.

01:37.040 --> 01:43.200
They were late, though, because I got... they said 15 to 20 minutes, got there 30 minutes

01:43.200 --> 01:44.200
later.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
It should have been done by now.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.240
I get there and they're like, oh, yeah, we forgot to put them in the oven.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.840
Well, that doesn't help me out any.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.640
It's like, fucking put it in the oven.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.640
We're sorry.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.560
Did you get it like a discount or a coupon or...

01:58.560 --> 01:59.560
Fuck no.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.560
Here's what ended up happening.

02:00.560 --> 02:04.520
I could tell you exactly what happened because I've been there because some stupid employee

02:04.520 --> 02:06.800
did it before.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.920
What happened was my twists were probably done, but there was another order that also

02:09.920 --> 02:12.960
had an order of twists, and so they just took it for that order.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.240
Oh, not cool.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.240
Yeah.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.240
Not cool.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.240
All right.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.440
Next up with us is the chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

02:21.440 --> 02:24.760
Going to Breakman in our chat room starts us off tonight.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.320
Every gamer has a voice.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.760
Just please don't embarrass the rest of us.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.080
I think that sums it up very well, actually.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.080
Thank you, Breakman.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.080
We do have another guest here in studio.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.600
We are very excited to have her on the show.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.360
She's a good friend of Dark Sakura.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.240
She's known for a very long time, and I love her to bits, too.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.840
And Loki, I don't think they ever really hang out, but they'd probably be besties if they

02:44.840 --> 02:45.840
did.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.440
Let's move on to Marissa.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.440
How are you?

02:48.440 --> 02:49.440
Hi, kiddies.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.440
How are you?

02:50.440 --> 02:51.440
I'm good.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.440
How are you?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.440
Good.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.440
And do you have a nickname that you use that we should call you?

02:54.440 --> 02:57.760
Well, I always go and buy Marissa con gusto, but my boyfriend prefers to call me Marissa

02:57.760 --> 02:58.760
con busto.

02:58.760 --> 02:59.760
That's right.

02:59.760 --> 03:05.840
Here's the thing, and it's a bummer we don't have the webcam anymore, but Marissa has big

03:05.840 --> 03:06.840
boobs.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.200
Oh, my God.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.880
They're so big.

03:09.880 --> 03:10.880
They're awesome.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.160
But we love them.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.040
And she also has a big brain, everybody, to go with it.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.040
Thank you.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.680
So don't just stare.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.280
The extra boobs are to hold extra brains.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.600
That's right.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.600
Exactly.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.920
And do you even play video games, or are you just kind of here for the lulz?

03:26.920 --> 03:27.920
Both.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.560
You know, actually, I listen every week, and I've always dated people that are really into

03:31.560 --> 03:34.880
games, but I'm kind of an old school gamer, and I'm just going to wait for eternity for

03:34.880 --> 03:38.040
another King's Quest to come out, and Thief is never going to come out.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.040
I don't care what they say.

03:40.040 --> 03:44.760
Okay, you can stay, because Retro Game, especially if you're going to go straight to King's Quest,

03:44.760 --> 03:49.360
which is some of the holy grail of PC games, and you know, we've actually had a lot of

03:49.360 --> 03:54.660
talk about the, and you may not even know this is out here, the fan-made King's Quest,

03:54.660 --> 03:55.660
the silver lining.

03:55.660 --> 03:56.660
I've heard about that.

03:56.660 --> 04:01.000
Yeah, it's totally free, and I think they're on the second episode now, and Roberta Williams,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.760
even though I think she lives out in the woods in a fort now and has totally disavowed all

04:04.760 --> 04:06.760
the gaming industry.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.600
The fort?

04:08.600 --> 04:11.040
That might be her fort, actually, out there in the wilderness.

04:11.040 --> 04:15.120
All I know is that she wants nothing to do with the gaming industry in this day and age,

04:15.120 --> 04:20.880
but she actually kind of gave it a blessing without giving it her blessing, like legally.

04:20.880 --> 04:25.680
It's basically like, hey, I'm not going to make any more of that series until I need

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
more money.

04:26.680 --> 04:32.920
Kind of like how JK Rowling's, I'm not going to make any more books, but maybe I could

04:32.920 --> 04:37.880
revisit the world at some point, when I start running out of money, of course.

04:37.880 --> 04:42.080
I love adventure games, and that's always been my thing, but there's all this hype about

04:42.080 --> 04:48.080
Siberia coming out, and that's like, to sit like no one ever boldly sat before a game.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.280
I bet you would like some of the stuff that Telltale does, because they're trying to make

04:51.280 --> 04:55.880
that live on with the whole Sam and Max games, they've got the Back to the Future games coming

04:55.880 --> 04:56.880
out soon.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.680
I bet you that type of stuff would be right up their alley.

04:58.680 --> 05:03.200
We need to get you and Seg here on the same night, because he works there, and he could

05:03.200 --> 05:04.840
sell you much better than I could.

05:04.840 --> 05:05.840
Love Sam and Max.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.840
All right.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.840
Anyhow, I just have to go to the chat room.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.560
I just want to give you a taste at the chatters.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.560
All right.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.560
I'm not even going to read the names here.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.560
Here we go.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.560
You ready?

05:16.560 --> 05:17.560
Let's see.

05:17.560 --> 05:22.520
Oh, actually, I will say Jessica Harper said, bigger than mine, possibly.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
I think so.

05:23.520 --> 05:26.840
I think you might both have to whip them out, and we'll see.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.920
Whoever wins this contest doesn't actually win, if you know what I mean.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.560
But here's some of the other comments.

05:32.560 --> 05:39.320
Awesomely big, big boobs, the mighty rack, take a photo and post it in the OLR gallery,

05:39.320 --> 05:40.440
OMG boobs.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.080
Her boobs have brains in them.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.440
Everybody likes boobs.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
Boobs.

05:44.440 --> 05:45.440
Balls.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.240
That's what the show's turned into tonight.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.600
Picks of tits or get the fuck out.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
That was from a girl.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.600
Just so you know.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.640
My boyfriend tells me tits are get-foes, so it's okay.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.640
Is it weird?

05:57.640 --> 05:58.640
No, wait.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.640
No, I lied.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.640
That was from a boy.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.080
So, but still, they want picks.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.200
Is it weird that I'm the one that's keeping the show grounded at this point?

06:06.200 --> 06:09.560
I mean, is that strange to you?

06:09.560 --> 06:14.720
I mean, clearly there was some type of crack cocaine in our turkey for the Thanksgiving

06:14.720 --> 06:15.720
holiday.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.720
I hope you all had a pleasant Thanksgiving.

06:17.720 --> 06:21.080
I hope you didn't, you know, get in a car wreck or anything.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.000
But if you're listening to the show, you must be fine.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.480
So congratulations, and I hope you had a wonderful one.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.480
It's not a girl.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.480
Don't kiss me.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.480
No, I know.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.200
It seems we're all running together, and I read it as somebody else.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.200
Sorry.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.200
It's live radio.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.360
I don't always do well at it, even though it's only been, what, nine years.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.480
So anyway, Marissa's gonna join us tonight and Lowell with us, and Shirley, if you have

06:41.480 --> 06:43.480
any input, you just jump right in there.

06:43.480 --> 06:47.080
And you will have no problem jumping right in there.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.720
We might play a game later, too, in part B, so that'll be fun.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.000
We'll get the chatters involved, and it'll be a good time.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
It's called Guess Marissa's Cup Size.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh, stop.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Stop.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
That would be a hard one.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Do you...

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
We don't want to...

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Ha ha, pun.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Sorry.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
You've done it with me.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Sorry.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.640
I don't want to give Marissa a complex or make people think it's only about her boobs,

07:08.640 --> 07:11.360
because actually, you are a musician, correct?

07:11.360 --> 07:12.360
Yes.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.360
You do.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.360
And what type of music do you do?

07:14.360 --> 07:19.400
Well, I do a neo-folk-pop thing, but as most...

07:19.400 --> 07:20.400
Neo-folk-pop.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.400
Yeah.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.640
It's like, acoustic is probably the better word, because you say folky, and people think

07:25.640 --> 07:27.360
like Peter, Paul, and Mary, you know.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.640
So like, Jewel, do you yodel?

07:29.640 --> 07:32.240
Um, well, uh, no.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.240
Okay.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.880
Because if you said yes, I was going to make you do it.

07:34.880 --> 07:42.140
I think, you know, most musicians nowadays specialize in being broke, so that's my feel.

07:42.140 --> 07:44.920
You are actually the definition of starving LA artist, correct?

07:44.920 --> 07:46.720
What's that old joke?

07:46.720 --> 07:48.960
What do you call a musician without a girlfriend?

07:48.960 --> 07:49.960
Homeless.

07:49.960 --> 07:54.600
Because I have the opposite situation.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.920
All right.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.960
Well, you know what?

07:57.960 --> 08:01.320
I've heard some of your stuff, and I know you've got talent, and it's just, that moment

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
will come.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
Someday.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.320
That moment will come.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.320
All right.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.440
But I love the whole folk-pop thing.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.440
That's amazing.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
All right.

08:08.440 --> 08:12.400
Anyhow, let's get into talking about our gaming weeks.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.280
We always start off the show talking about what's going on in our gaming world this week,

08:15.280 --> 08:16.280
so we'll go to Dark Sakura.

08:16.280 --> 08:19.920
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

08:19.920 --> 08:29.120
Well, we played some Rock Band of the Beatles and Three Variety, and Marissa belted out

08:29.120 --> 08:42.320
a good one, and some Star Trek Online, a lot of games on my phone, that's about it.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.320
All right.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.440
You look amused, like you're about to laugh about something.

08:46.440 --> 08:49.860
It's just chat and boobs, and the show amuses me.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.000
It's okay to laugh.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.720
I am wearing my Silent Hill shirt, though.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.720
I'm very happy.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.720
Yes, you are.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.720
Because it's cold.

08:55.720 --> 08:56.720
I could wear my Silent Hill shirt.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.440
At least it's not foggy, then that might be the right kind of atmosphere.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.440
It was the other day.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.440
Was it?

09:01.440 --> 09:02.440
Yes, it was.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.440
It was quite foggy last night.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.440
All right.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.440
Well, let's go to Loki.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.440
How was your gaming week?

09:06.440 --> 09:07.440
Anything new or exciting?

09:07.440 --> 09:08.440
No.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.440
Unfortunately not.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.440
It really is.

09:10.440 --> 09:15.680
Just Grand Theft Auto this week, and Stick Wars on my iPod.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.640
That was about it, I mean, really.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.120
What is Stick Wars?

09:20.120 --> 09:23.760
Stick Wars, remember that game, Defender Castle, where you take little stick figures and throw

09:23.760 --> 09:24.760
them into the air?

09:24.760 --> 09:25.760
You told me a little bit about this last week.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.800
Yeah, it's basically like a knockoff of that, and then, so I've been playing it forever

09:30.800 --> 09:35.000
now, and yeah, it's really it.

09:35.000 --> 09:42.320
I mean, I don't know, I haven't been able to do much else because I had to make dinner

09:42.320 --> 09:49.040
for Thanksgiving, and then I had to put up Christmas lights, and put up a tree, and...

09:49.040 --> 09:52.660
Well, it sounds like you didn't have much of a holiday.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.480
You had more of a working past few days.

09:55.480 --> 10:00.560
And fixed my sister's computer because she got like 65 different things of spyware on

10:00.560 --> 10:01.560
there.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.660
That takes talent.

10:03.660 --> 10:08.120
How many porn sites does one have to visit to get all of that spyware installed?

10:08.120 --> 10:09.120
I just reinstalled Windows.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.160
It's my old laptop that I used to bring in.

10:11.160 --> 10:16.360
Thankfully, because I was like, well, I hate the fact that this has a super recovery partition.

10:16.360 --> 10:21.280
I love the fact that that has a super recovery partition because all I did was, eh, fuck

10:21.280 --> 10:26.460
it, I don't care, back up, and it'll just erase everything out of there, reinstall Windows

10:26.460 --> 10:31.400
with all the stuff that was on there from when I got it, and any files that were important

10:31.400 --> 10:34.680
get backed up into a folder, delete everything else, and we're good.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.640
So I can reinstall Windows like super quick.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.640
It's awesome.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.920
But, yeah, that's pretty much all I was doing.

10:43.920 --> 10:47.160
I was hoping to play some Connect stuff, never got around to that.

10:47.160 --> 10:51.040
In fact, I can't now because I moved the coffee table to put the tree in.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.240
So I don't have room anymore to play Connect in my living room.

10:54.240 --> 10:59.460
You notice I notice a lot of people complaining about the amount of space that Connect requires,

10:59.460 --> 11:02.160
that for a lot of people it actually isn't practical.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.520
I've noticed that kind of buzz around the internet lately, like a lot of people complaining

11:05.520 --> 11:06.520
about the space you need.

11:06.520 --> 11:09.560
Well, it's just that coffee table, I don't like it anymore.

11:09.560 --> 11:15.440
You know, it's a coffee table I got from my grandparents, I mean it's old, and it's really

11:15.440 --> 11:16.440
cumbersome.

11:16.440 --> 11:22.400
I'm thinking of getting two ottomans instead and just sitting them next to each other for

11:22.400 --> 11:27.160
a coffee table, and that way we can use them as seating as well if we need to, and we can

11:27.160 --> 11:30.240
move them out of the way a lot easier.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.480
It's just that set of furniture is just really old.

11:33.480 --> 11:38.320
But anyways, yeah, so not that I was really going to be able to play Connect stuff anyways,

11:38.320 --> 11:41.760
I know I get a lot of time to play games at home, but at work though I can.

11:41.760 --> 11:46.240
In fact, it's funny, some of my co-workers, they're in charge of, oh, here's something

11:46.240 --> 11:49.800
else I forgot to mention last week, it was hilarious.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.160
Holy slit my mind.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.920
I actually rode a mechanical bull last week.

11:53.920 --> 11:54.920
What?

11:54.920 --> 12:01.360
Yes, our work, they do these parties once a month or whatever at the end of each month.

12:01.360 --> 12:05.760
So last week was technically the end of the month because we weren't there this week.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.000
And you rode a mechanical bull?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.880
So it was more like a drunken sorority party then?

12:09.880 --> 12:10.880
No.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.880
Okay.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.280
It was funny because I wanted to see, you know, I wanted to do it better than everybody

12:14.280 --> 12:15.280
else.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.280
Sure, of course.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.280
And how long did you last?

12:17.280 --> 12:18.280
I did really well actually.

12:18.280 --> 12:24.480
In fact, I was taunting the guy that was operating it, and so he did a really difficult ride,

12:24.480 --> 12:27.240
and I kicked the crap out of it, so it was fun.

12:27.240 --> 12:30.600
So you just have to hold on and...

12:30.600 --> 12:31.600
Pretty much.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.960
It was pretty easy.

12:33.960 --> 12:38.960
No, but other than that, just a lot more, you know, Dance Central.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.920
Actually, I did play a little bit of Dance Central during work, just some of the few

12:42.920 --> 12:43.920
songs on there.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.720
I'm thinking of getting some of the download content, but I'm gonna have to wait until

12:47.720 --> 12:49.760
I upgrade certain systems.

12:49.760 --> 12:53.960
You do know there are very, very few people out there listening to the show or anywhere

12:53.960 --> 12:56.720
that can say, I played Dance Central at work?

12:56.720 --> 12:59.480
Well, on my break, you know.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.040
No, I know, but still, this is funny.

13:02.040 --> 13:06.640
And then of course, still working on editing Grand Theft Auto stuff, and then yesterday

13:06.640 --> 13:08.640
I was messing with...

13:08.640 --> 13:09.640
It's not even really a game.

13:09.640 --> 13:16.100
Well, I consider it a game because I'm getting free money for exploiting a website.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.280
So that was kind of a game.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.640
This is a website, appredeem.com.

13:19.640 --> 13:27.440
You download free apps, paid apps, or if you have a jailbroken phone, free apps, and they

13:27.440 --> 13:29.440
give you money.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.720
Interesting.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.520
Like straight into your PayPal account.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.640
This sounds like one of those free iPod schemes.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.760
It's not a scheme though, but here's the thing.

13:37.760 --> 13:42.600
I guess they're trying to entice you to buy the apps, but if you really don't want to,

13:42.600 --> 13:47.360
you just put in your PayPal account, the email that you use for your PayPal account, and

13:47.360 --> 13:51.520
you can just go download the free apps and you get like $1.50 for free.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.520
Weird.

13:52.520 --> 13:57.720
So, you don't even have to buy any of the paid apps, just download the free ones.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.720
It's a free dollar.

13:58.720 --> 14:02.200
I mean, who would not want free money?

14:02.200 --> 14:03.360
The apps do suck though.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.280
They're terrible apps.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.160
I was going to say, do they pay you to give that little plug here on our show?

14:09.160 --> 14:12.360
No, I just thought it was cool because it's free money.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.860
See, if I was trying to exploit everything, I would give out a link or something that

14:16.860 --> 14:20.560
would have like some sort of referral thing or something where I'd get credit for it,

14:20.560 --> 14:21.560
but I don't care.

14:21.560 --> 14:27.200
So, I'm just saying though that, I mean, all you do is download these apps, you go into

14:27.200 --> 14:31.600
them for like a second, go back to the website, you get credit for it, delete the app, you're

14:31.600 --> 14:32.600
done.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.600
Wow.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.600
All right.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
Anyways.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
Well, anything, yeah.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.840
I like this comment in our chat room, Act Def says, a week later, my PayPal account

14:39.840 --> 14:40.840
got hacked.

14:40.840 --> 14:46.560
I don't think they can hack your PayPal account by just giving them an email address, and

14:46.560 --> 14:47.560
it doesn't have to...

14:47.560 --> 14:48.560
Or use a different one.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.560
Yeah, exactly.

14:49.560 --> 14:50.560
It doesn't have to be.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.200
I didn't realize it was, they were going to use that email address as a PayPal account,

14:53.200 --> 14:57.320
so I'd actually create a second PayPal account for the email address that I gave them, so

14:57.320 --> 14:58.320
whatever.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.320
All right.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.200
I'll just send it to my original PayPal account.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.200
All right.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.200
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

15:03.200 --> 15:04.200
That's it.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.200
All right.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.480
Marissa, I don't know if you've been playing any games recently, but I thought I'd ask

15:08.480 --> 15:09.480
if there's anything.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.600
I know you have one of those, don't you have like one of those fancy Windows phones now

15:11.600 --> 15:12.600
or something?

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
I don't know.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.640
Maybe you've been playing games on that.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.920
You don't put the word fancy and Windows phone together.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.400
Well, they have this new thing there.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.680
Maybe it's like the new Windows phone they're really pushing, but it's this whole like Xbox

15:22.680 --> 15:26.320
Live integration, and it's trying to compete with the iPhone.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.320
Excuse me.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.320
Yeah.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.320
I, yeah.

15:29.320 --> 15:34.760
I have a Touch Pro 2, and nobody cares anything for it, and it's Sprint, but I only pay, you

15:34.760 --> 15:39.920
know, 35 bucks a month, so I'll deal with it, but I've, I don't know, I've heard just

15:39.920 --> 15:43.520
within the community, because I was looking, you know, like I'm ineligible for any upgrades

15:43.520 --> 15:48.560
even though the hardware is capable of it, which stinks, but HTC makes a good phone,

15:48.560 --> 15:50.960
so at least I know that everything else is solid.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.400
And I lost my rock band, Virginity, to Jamie.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
Nice.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.400
So.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.080
So did you, you actually did some of the singing in the game?

15:58.080 --> 16:02.960
The singing, I played a guitar and bass, and I guess I have to go back and now tell my

16:02.960 --> 16:06.220
musician friends who are always bitching about it that they appreciate it.

16:06.220 --> 16:09.280
This is where I wanted to go with this, because a lot of musicians, I'm glad you brought this

16:09.280 --> 16:14.420
up, because a lot of musicians like to razz on rock band because it's not really playing

16:14.420 --> 16:20.000
an instrument, and it's like dumbing down music, and did you feel that way, or were

16:20.000 --> 16:22.920
you like, no, this is just, this is just fun and nothing else?

16:22.920 --> 16:28.000
In a really abstract way, I could see how like for, like a little kid, you know, like

16:28.000 --> 16:31.280
maybe you should just actually give them an instrument before just, I mean, if they, if

16:31.280 --> 16:34.180
they have a musical instrument, you should probably give them a real instrument and let

16:34.180 --> 16:39.160
them explore that, as opposed to just trying to virtually experience that, but like you're,

16:39.160 --> 16:43.120
you know, otherwise, I mean, the game is great, and it's a lot of fun, and as opposed to what

16:43.120 --> 16:47.720
a lot of people think, you have to appreciate the music in order to really enjoy the game.

16:47.720 --> 16:52.320
I mean, because the game by itself is entertaining, but again, we really have to enjoy the music

16:52.320 --> 16:54.320
to get all your money's worth.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.320
It's fun.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.320
Yeah.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.840
So, and I don't know if you got to see any of this, but, well, probably not, because

16:59.840 --> 17:03.280
I don't think the actual guitars are out, or I don't think Jamie has them, but there's

17:03.280 --> 17:07.320
actually these pro modes now in rock band where you can like learn to play the real

17:07.320 --> 17:09.800
instrument, and I've been doing it for keyboard, which is kind of fun, because I used to play

17:09.800 --> 17:13.720
keyboard back when I was like 12, so it's kind of fun to get back into that.

17:13.720 --> 17:18.280
And you know, if you wait long enough, even though it is kind of an inferior game, according

17:18.280 --> 17:23.800
to reviews, I'm sure Power Giggle will drop in price really quickly, and that has, you

17:23.800 --> 17:25.400
know, a electric guitar with it too.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.400
That's what I saw, actually, though.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.640
The thing, though, that ticked me off about that, though, I mean, I, you know, I don't

17:29.640 --> 17:33.080
know if there's the gaming part of it, but you can get a really nice starter guitar for

17:33.080 --> 17:35.480
the price of that piece of crap, I'm sorry.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
It's alright.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.480
Like, if you want...

17:37.480 --> 17:38.480
We're honest here at OLR.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.520
Just like for the, you know, if you want to play the game, that's fine, if you want to

17:41.520 --> 17:45.680
play and even use that to learn, that's fine too, but it's way overpriced, considering

17:45.680 --> 17:47.920
that you can go get a nice squire, you know.

17:47.920 --> 17:51.880
I think for some people, though, it's really that interactivity, that it, being able to

17:51.880 --> 17:55.880
kind of interact and get that, you know, we're a very instant gratification society, right?

17:55.880 --> 17:59.080
So to pick up a guitar and just kind of strum sometimes isn't, because you're not sure if

17:59.080 --> 18:00.080
you're doing it right.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.360
Unless you're playing Green Day songs, then who cares.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.480
What I think that we should do...

18:03.480 --> 18:05.680
Because you know there's a whole rock band that's just Green Day.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.560
I don't know how you can do that, it's only three chords.

18:07.560 --> 18:11.000
Well, because there's five buttons, so it works.

18:11.000 --> 18:17.120
No, no, what they need to do is just have like another like contest or something, like

18:17.120 --> 18:18.840
a power gig contest.

18:18.840 --> 18:23.280
Once those things get cheap enough, you just smash the guitar at the end of each song.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.280
It's fun.

18:24.280 --> 18:29.680
It's like, yeah, this game sucks, but that felt good.

18:29.680 --> 18:33.800
It's funny though, it's easier to smash expensive guitars than cheap ones, because the cheaper

18:33.800 --> 18:35.760
ones are made out of plywood and plastic.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.760
Yeah, I know.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.840
I know those cheap ones would be a lot harder to break.

18:38.840 --> 18:44.680
Fine, how about like, you know, like kind of spinning around with it, throwing it javelin

18:44.680 --> 18:49.360
style into a wood chipper, how about that?

18:49.360 --> 18:51.200
Nice.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.200
Will it blend?

18:52.200 --> 18:56.960
Alright, so good, I'm glad the musician got to try some rock bands, so will you try it

18:56.960 --> 18:57.960
again at some point?

18:57.960 --> 18:58.960
Oh, it was so much fun.

18:58.960 --> 18:59.960
It really was.

18:59.960 --> 19:00.960
Awesome.

19:00.960 --> 19:01.960
Awesome.

19:01.960 --> 19:02.960
The harmony feature is really neat too.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.360
Yeah, the harmony feature is kind of cool, because it's hard for some people to hear

19:06.360 --> 19:10.120
the harmony, I think, and that takes a little while to kind of train your ears to be able

19:10.120 --> 19:14.640
to hear that, so kind of to get that, again, instant feedback in a game like Rock Band,

19:14.640 --> 19:15.900
which is what I really think it's all about.

19:15.900 --> 19:19.960
It's more like that instant gratification, hey, I hit the right chord, or oh wow, I'm

19:19.960 --> 19:20.960
way off.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.720
And as I said, despite what I thought too, I mean, I wasn't as crazy as some of my other

19:24.720 --> 19:28.640
friends, you have to appreciate the song to really enjoy the game, so it's a good way

19:28.640 --> 19:31.560
of promoting music and enjoying music.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.560
I have found some new bands through Rock Band.

19:34.560 --> 19:40.160
Like there's a song I really like in Rock Band 3, Last Dance, and I'd never heard, I

19:40.160 --> 19:43.320
think the band's like the Ravenettes or something, I'd never heard of them before, but I really

19:43.320 --> 19:44.320
like the song.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.320
I checked out their CD.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.320
It's kind of cool.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.320
So there you go.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.320
All right.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.920
My gaming week, I actually played a few different games this week, and a lot of that is thanks

19:51.920 --> 19:54.840
to the Steam sale, but I'll get to that in a minute.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.240
I did touch back on some of the games I played last week.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.880
Now last week I'd only played demos, but this week I did just jump in and I bought the full

20:00.880 --> 20:05.560
version of Super Meat Boy, which is, it's, it's pretty great.

20:05.560 --> 20:09.840
I got to say it's, it's actually, I would go so far as to say it's one of the best arcade

20:09.840 --> 20:14.080
games that is out there right now, period, like at all.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.400
And I would have never thought that this game would fall in that category, but I love the

20:17.400 --> 20:24.800
kind of like, I want to say it's almost like a WarioWare-ish game, but Mario style.

20:24.800 --> 20:30.120
What I mean by that is that a lot of the levels in the game should take you no more than 30

20:30.120 --> 20:31.320
seconds to beat.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.260
And most of them are in the like 15 to 20 second range.

20:34.260 --> 20:39.000
So it's really about like just learning the exact like right pattern to kind of beat a

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
level.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
It's like playing an old Mega Man game or something.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.080
I don't know.

20:42.080 --> 20:46.680
I'm just having a lot of fun getting extraordinarily frustrated playing Super Meat Boy when I'm

20:46.680 --> 20:50.480
like two seconds away from beating a level and just screwing it up.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.520
And I got to tell you, Alan was watching me play and he would, he wants to watch me play

20:54.520 --> 20:58.640
just to laugh at me getting so frustrated when I get so close to beating a level and

20:58.640 --> 21:02.640
then I like, oops, fall in the gear and get Super Meat Boy all chopped up or whatever.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.940
So yeah, I actually think Super Meat Boy is amazing.

21:05.940 --> 21:11.680
My only, I guess, complaint is that I think in some ways it's almost too hard.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.200
Like there's a lot of people that are going to buy Super Meat Boy that are never going

21:15.200 --> 21:18.160
to get past the second level.

21:18.160 --> 21:23.060
And it's kind of unfortunate, but if you keep with it, I mean that can also be the big reward

21:23.060 --> 21:24.060
with it.

21:24.060 --> 21:25.400
Did you get to check out the internet?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.080
No, I haven't got there yet.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.840
I don't know if that's towards the end or what, but I'm, I'm only on like the third

21:29.840 --> 21:30.840
level.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.360
It's taken me a long time to get there too.

21:32.360 --> 21:38.040
I mean, it's, it's been quite a bit of a gaming time, so, uh, I will keep trying to get there.

21:38.040 --> 21:41.700
I love the warp zones that take you to the retro style levels.

21:41.700 --> 21:45.840
I thought that was amazing and it has like retro music and the soundtrack is astounding.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.960
I'm going to, um, for the live listeners, I'll do some of the soundtrack for break tonight,

21:48.960 --> 21:50.500
but the soundtrack is astounding.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.840
It is great.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.240
And it's all like indie stuff.

21:53.240 --> 21:56.920
I think the guy who did the soundtracks not really done any other games before.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.000
So it's, um, it's great.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.400
There's really only one Xbox live arcade game I'm waiting for.

22:03.400 --> 22:07.120
Um, and unfortunately I don't know when it's coming out.

22:07.120 --> 22:10.200
The insanely twisted shadow planet.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.200
Never heard of that.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.600
You gotta watch the video for it.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
Okay.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
It's awesome.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.600
Should I look it up right now?

22:15.600 --> 22:16.600
What is it?

22:16.600 --> 22:17.600
Okay.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.600
It's got an awesome song that goes with it.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.960
It's, um, I don't even know.

22:19.960 --> 22:23.120
It's not really a shooter, but you play it like a UFO.

22:23.120 --> 22:29.600
It's this guy, he's a really good artist and I'm loading up insanely twisted shadow planet

22:29.600 --> 22:30.600
debut trailer.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.600
I'm going to jump in the middle.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.600
Awesome.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.560
Um, song goes along with it.

22:34.560 --> 22:37.160
I'm not hearing.

22:37.160 --> 22:48.000
Oh, cause I, Oh, this kind of has that, um, it was that game limbo, not braid, but the

22:48.000 --> 22:58.720
other artsy one now it's looking like an automate or something.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.720
Planet's collide

22:59.720 --> 23:06.920
like when they get down to the actual gameplay, well that's like UFOs flying this part of

23:06.920 --> 23:07.920
the game with the UFOs flying.

23:07.920 --> 23:08.920
Yeah.

23:08.920 --> 23:09.920
That's all part of the game.

23:09.920 --> 23:10.920
What is this?

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
An arcade release?

23:11.920 --> 23:24.160
So it looks like you're like this little UFO and you're flying through different levels

23:24.160 --> 23:25.160
and dodging obstacles.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.160
Wow.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.160
Something that's really good.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.160
Okay.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.160
Yeah.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.160
The art style is pretty rad on this.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.160
I like that.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.160
All right.

23:32.160 --> 23:40.040
Well, I don't, this can't be a very exciting radio, but that does look pretty cool.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.040
I like that.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.920
It's like a half shooter, half, almost like the same concept of super meat boy.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.260
You're trying to get through a level, get through these tricky ways.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.760
I'm going to paste the link there in chat.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.760
Sorry.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.360
The folks listening on podcasts, but you won't be able to get that link, but just look for

23:52.360 --> 23:54.760
insanely twisted shadow planet.

23:54.760 --> 23:55.760
Interesting.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.480
All right.

23:57.480 --> 24:03.760
Uh, also I played more Pac-Man championship edition deluxe, which, uh, I love there's,

24:03.760 --> 24:08.600
there's very, very satisfying, uh, rewards when you gobble up a train of 30 ghosts, uh,

24:08.600 --> 24:09.840
I get the high score.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.640
Uh, again, the music's great.

24:11.640 --> 24:15.120
Kind of the same stuff I was saying last week, buying the retail version didn't really change

24:15.120 --> 24:16.120
my opinions there.

24:16.120 --> 24:20.680
I still think it's, it's a worthy upgrade if you like the last one, um, new games I

24:20.680 --> 24:23.640
played this week, thanks to a steam and some of the sales going on there.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.200
I did finally play poker night at the inventory cause that finally came out, which is the

24:27.200 --> 24:32.220
Texas hold and poker game that features, um, uh, like some of the characters that you see

24:32.220 --> 24:39.080
in various telltale games and, uh, valve really cause heavy from team fortress is in there.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.600
Tycho is in there and strong bad.

24:41.600 --> 24:48.440
So, um, it's a Texas hold them game and I've, it's, it's really kind of, that's it.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.840
It's really a no frills poker game.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.920
There's not a whole lot of modes.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.100
There is not a multiplayer.

24:55.100 --> 24:58.040
So you might be wondering, well then why would I bother with this game?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.760
Well, a it's $5, right?

24:59.760 --> 25:03.520
I think it's only $5 to get this game and a 10 at most.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.000
I think it's only five though.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.680
And there was a lot of sales going on during the pre-order.

25:06.680 --> 25:08.840
I think I paid five for it like two months ago.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
Yeah.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.120
It's, it's very, very cheap.

25:11.120 --> 25:16.620
And uh, it's mostly like, I think of it as like an interactive comic strip in a way because

25:16.620 --> 25:20.000
the strength of the game is really in the writing and in the voice acting.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.820
And about 98% of that all comes back to strong bad, uh, pretty much anytime strong bad says

25:25.820 --> 25:27.480
something it's pretty fucking funny.

25:27.480 --> 25:32.080
Uh, the rest of it, like the heavy and, and the, the, the max I can kind of give and take.

25:32.080 --> 25:37.240
But uh, yeah, I loved a strong bad Tycho's all right, but I dunno, there's something

25:37.240 --> 25:41.400
about him where like he comes off as a real smug asshole in the game and like, I don't

25:41.400 --> 25:42.400
know when I read...

25:42.400 --> 25:43.400
That's exactly his character.

25:43.400 --> 25:49.500
Yes, but I don't know when I read Penny Arcade, I don't quite get it as strong as I get it

25:49.500 --> 25:51.400
in the Poker Night game.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.400
Even better if it was Gabe.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.740
But it was, it was fine.

25:54.740 --> 25:55.740
It's fine.

25:55.740 --> 26:01.840
I mean for a $5 poker game, I more look at it as you're buying laughs.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.800
If you want an actual poker game, this is not the game to get.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.800
It's not.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.040
It's a very no frills, low thing.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.800
But if you want something that's, I'm gonna laugh.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.960
I'm gonna waste a little time and have fun with this.

26:15.960 --> 26:18.160
That's where, you know, $5 is a pretty damn good deal.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.880
If they were trying to charge like 30 though for this, I'd say no way.

26:21.880 --> 26:22.880
No way.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.080
But $5 is really hard to argue with.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.440
So the price is right on this one.

26:27.440 --> 26:32.740
Um, but don't expect a lot of modes and extra stuff unless, unless there's like unlockable

26:32.740 --> 26:36.440
things that I haven't found yet, which I wouldn't doubt at all, actually.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.240
Like Latas in there and stuff.

26:38.240 --> 26:42.280
I wouldn't doubt at all that there'd be some hidden shit in there that I just haven't found

26:42.280 --> 26:43.280
yet and that's fine.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.620
I, I didn't, you know, I actually bought the game.

26:45.620 --> 26:49.240
I didn't get a review copy that has the little sheet that tells you how to get all the unlocks

26:49.240 --> 26:51.840
that a lot of publishers do.

26:51.840 --> 26:58.320
Anyhow, also another game that I got, um, Recettear, an item shop's tale, I think was

26:58.320 --> 27:00.320
the name of the game.

27:00.320 --> 27:07.160
It's, it's a PC version of a game that looks like it was done on the PlayStation 1.

27:07.160 --> 27:11.840
And I don't know if it was like translated or what the deal is, but I mean, Alan summed

27:11.840 --> 27:12.960
it up perfectly.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.720
He was looking at it going, this game is so weeaboo.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.000
Like and that's really what it is.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.560
It's just this very like chibi, teehee, I'm playing a dumb girl that's opening an item

27:23.560 --> 27:29.640
shop and I have this little fairy that helps navigate me through the complex item shop

27:29.640 --> 27:33.720
stuff and we go to the village and find a hero to take us through the dungeons.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.580
Like it's just like, oh my God, I'm going to barf.

27:35.580 --> 27:38.560
This is so like just stupid.

27:38.560 --> 27:43.480
But I will say one thing I liked about it, well, A, I bought it in a pack of like five

27:43.480 --> 27:45.060
games for five bucks.

27:45.060 --> 27:49.340
So like considering I paid a whole dollar for Recettear, it's hard to complain.

27:49.340 --> 27:56.840
But B, I actually really like the idea of the game because the idea of the game is that

27:56.840 --> 28:03.200
you're not the hero, you run the item shop in a hero's game.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.200
It's on my wish list.

28:04.200 --> 28:08.400
Which is kind of, oh, it's a bummer you didn't sign in a couple days ago and it was on sale

28:08.400 --> 28:09.400
for like five bucks.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.560
I've been too busy having fun with Marissa.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.880
I guess that's fair enough.

28:13.880 --> 28:17.040
Having pillow fights and talking about boobies.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.840
All right.

28:18.840 --> 28:22.840
So yeah, Recettear, I honestly would not pay more than five dollars for this game.

28:22.840 --> 28:25.880
And even then it's like, you might want to check out a demo first to see if it's really

28:25.880 --> 28:26.920
for you.

28:26.920 --> 28:30.680
But some of the like, okay, I didn't even really describe the game.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.400
I'm all over the place tonight, guys, sorry.

28:33.400 --> 28:38.440
You run an item shop and so you can buy and sell things.

28:38.440 --> 28:43.600
You can buy things from people to come in or you can sell things that you find in dungeons.

28:43.600 --> 28:48.560
And in order to go into a dungeon, you hire a hero to go into the dungeon for you.

28:48.560 --> 28:53.560
And I don't know, they somehow write this into the very chibi story that the item shop

28:53.560 --> 28:57.400
girl is protected and she can't get hit by the monsters, but the hero can.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.000
But the item shop girl will collect all the items.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.680
So it's like you go dungeon exploring, collect all this trash that you sell in your shop.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.480
And then it gets more complicated later on.

29:06.480 --> 29:10.120
You can like fuse things together and make like, you know, super coconuts and whatever

29:10.120 --> 29:15.360
it is that, you know, you sell coconuts, you sell in an item shop and like Uber mushrooms.

29:15.360 --> 29:19.880
I mean, swallows carry a super coconut.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.080
I don't know.

29:21.080 --> 29:25.240
So is it an African swallow or European swallow?

29:25.240 --> 29:29.840
I'm looking in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com and some of the folks talking about Poker Night

29:29.840 --> 29:31.240
at the inventory.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.000
Deathwishing says, Skye, there's Team Fortress 2 hats.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.280
Yes, I have heard that there are unlocks for other games in it.

29:37.280 --> 29:38.360
I did miss that.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.920
So yeah, that's correct.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.560
You can unlock some items that show up in other games.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.600
It's pretty cool.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.080
Brakeman in chat says, what the fuck?

29:46.080 --> 29:48.540
Skye buys his games after heavily drinking.

29:48.540 --> 29:51.160
I don't think I was drinking heavily when I bought that game, actually.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.160
So there you go.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.160
All right.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.160
Anyhow.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.160
Yeah.

29:56.160 --> 30:00.840
So Recettear is, if you like those like chibi import PlayStation 1 games, then this is right

30:00.840 --> 30:01.840
up your alley.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.980
But if you're looking for like a serious RPG, don't bother.

30:04.980 --> 30:05.980
But I like the concept.

30:05.980 --> 30:11.160
I like that idea that you're not always the hero, that sometimes you're the girl running

30:11.160 --> 30:13.720
the item shop who's kind of a ditz.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.720
Fun.

30:14.720 --> 30:19.520
So let's move on into housekeeping tonight before we get into the news.

30:19.520 --> 30:22.680
In our housekeeping tonight, we still have shows scheduled through the end of the year.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.760
We don't have any weeks off or anything.

30:24.760 --> 30:29.120
Sadly, it does not look like Dark Soccer and I are going to be taking a trip mid-December

30:29.120 --> 30:32.640
as we originally planned because stupid economy and all that stuff.

30:32.640 --> 30:38.320
But that's why we had to get Marissa up here this time.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.120
But we will still be bringing you much OLR through the rest of the year.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.520
If you like the show and we hope you do, please consider adding us on Twitter.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.480
We're also on Facebook.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.880
You can like us at Orange Lounge Radio.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.520
Just search for that and we should come right up.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.340
We always want more fans on Facebook.

30:54.340 --> 30:58.880
It helps us spread the word about our show because we don't have big budgets of advertising

30:58.880 --> 31:00.360
dollars or any of that good stuff.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.520
All right, let's talk about the news this week.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.520
Believe it or not, there was still quite a bit of news going on even though it was a

31:05.520 --> 31:06.520
holiday week.

31:06.520 --> 31:07.800
So let's get into it.

31:07.800 --> 31:08.800
Loki.

31:08.800 --> 31:09.800
There was some news, yes.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.760
Not a lot of huge stuff, but interesting things.

31:12.760 --> 31:17.040
Mainly just news about Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which we don't really need the cover

31:17.040 --> 31:21.400
because Black Friday's already passed and Cyber Monday, well, why even bother?

31:21.400 --> 31:26.100
Because by the time you hear this, it'll probably be too late anyways.

31:26.100 --> 31:30.500
We haven't reported on PSP firmware updates in a while, probably because a lot of people

31:30.500 --> 31:33.080
have kind of written off the PSP.

31:33.080 --> 31:41.880
But anyways, there is a firmware update, 6.35, and it adds Curiosity, which I guess is a

31:41.880 --> 31:50.000
new music streaming service called Music Unlimited, which I guess is powered by Curiosity, and

31:50.000 --> 31:53.120
that's something that was announced back in September.

31:53.120 --> 31:58.960
And then of course, also in Japan, they're getting something called XRadar, which looks

31:58.960 --> 32:04.280
like some sort of GPS mapping software or something like that.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.280
This has been around in Japan for a long time, right?

32:06.280 --> 32:09.760
It seems like during Japanese releases, I'm always talking about some type of navigational

32:09.760 --> 32:12.360
thing that's coming out on the PSP over there.

32:12.360 --> 32:15.520
I feel like this is something that's been in there a while, or maybe it's like a newer

32:15.520 --> 32:16.520
technology, I don't know.

32:16.520 --> 32:22.680
Well, they've had a GPS add-on for a long time, and I want to say that I believe all

32:22.680 --> 32:27.480
the other regions have support for it, but they've just never sold it over here, which

32:27.480 --> 32:32.600
is too bad because that'd be pretty awesome to have GPS on, you know, a PSP might make

32:32.600 --> 32:39.040
it kind of worth it, but at this point I think they've just given up on it.

32:39.040 --> 32:44.440
And I'm also assuming that there's some sort of fixes for, you know, software hacks and

32:44.440 --> 32:49.960
stuff like that in there, because that's always something that, you know, they kind of do.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.840
But that is available, I believe now.

32:52.840 --> 32:53.840
So neat.

32:53.840 --> 33:02.800
It's kind of late, if you ask me, though, to add a music service to the PSP, considering,

33:02.800 --> 33:06.640
I mean, it's almost at the end of its life cycle.

33:06.640 --> 33:10.520
Or are you saying that just because we've had all this talk about PSP2 news lately?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.600
It's gonna be announced next year, I mean, come on.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.720
Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's coming out next year.

33:14.720 --> 33:17.000
Oh, it's coming out, I bet you, by holiday next year.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.080
Okay, well that's still one year away from today.

33:19.080 --> 33:23.340
That's still at the end of its life cycle, I mean, what big games have they announced

33:23.340 --> 33:25.440
for the PSP that haven't come out yet?

33:25.440 --> 33:29.440
Well, they're kind of still being powered by some of the big titles that came out, like

33:29.440 --> 33:33.800
that Kingdom Hearts game is pretty beautiful, if you kind of see it.

33:33.800 --> 33:37.800
Yeah, but I mean, come on, like, the only things that they had come out in November

33:37.800 --> 33:43.640
that were worthwhile, I guess, the new God of War game, Ghost of Sparta, which, I mean,

33:43.640 --> 33:50.360
come on, it's, how many prequel games to the God of War series do we really need, I mean?

33:50.360 --> 33:54.880
And then they did have another Ghost Recon game come out on the PSP, but there's not

33:54.880 --> 33:59.920
a lot of other things that are available for the PSP that are kind of worthwhile.

33:59.920 --> 34:04.040
It's really slowing down.

34:04.040 --> 34:08.520
So I don't, I don't really know, I'm just assuming it's gonna be kind of going away

34:08.520 --> 34:11.000
at some point very soon.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.640
Breakman in our chatroom at chat.orangetoloungeradio.com, as we tape live on this Sunday evening, asks,

34:15.640 --> 34:19.400
I thought they were gonna heavily market the PSP this year, didn't they get a kid to be

34:19.400 --> 34:20.400
the face of the PSP?

34:20.400 --> 34:22.880
I haven't seen a PSP commercial in a long time.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.920
Yeah, thank God, because he's so fucking annoying.

34:25.920 --> 34:29.320
Well, is that maybe because their big focus this year has been on the move, that they

34:29.320 --> 34:30.960
really want to sell the PlayStation Move?

34:30.960 --> 34:35.520
They are really trying to focus on marketing the PSP, but the stuff that they're focusing

34:35.520 --> 34:42.780
on, it's just like catalog titles and, you know, just, you know, what small releases

34:42.780 --> 34:43.780
that they have coming out.

34:43.780 --> 34:47.740
I mean, what, or I shouldn't say small, what few releases they have coming out, I mean,

34:47.740 --> 34:52.400
their big marketing campaign is, hey look, we got these old games that are $10 now.

34:52.400 --> 34:56.880
I mean, that's great, I guess, you know, these games that have been out for a long time.

34:56.880 --> 35:00.400
I mean, really, do we need to be marketing ModNation erasers still?

35:00.400 --> 35:02.760
I mean, that game came out six months ago.

35:02.760 --> 35:09.600
AkumaJP in our chatroom says Monster Hunter 3rd is big here, he lives over in Japan, so.

35:09.600 --> 35:14.760
Well that's in Japan, yeah, Monster Hunter does okay over here, I think, but I'm sure

35:14.760 --> 35:19.020
that's gonna be coming out probably next year at some point, but it just, it's not a big,

35:19.020 --> 35:21.520
as big of a deal here as it is in Japan.

35:21.520 --> 35:26.520
I mean, Monster Hunter tried it alright on the Wii, but there's just not a lot of stuff.

35:26.520 --> 35:31.080
It's just, you know, it's a handful of titles that are coming out each year for the PSP,

35:31.080 --> 35:33.920
and that's really sad compared to what's coming out in the DS.

35:33.920 --> 35:38.200
Granted, the DS also gets a lot of crap that comes out for it, but, I mean, even these

35:38.200 --> 35:42.080
companies that put out crap aren't even spending their time on the PSP.

35:42.080 --> 35:48.800
I mean, if you have the shovelware makers avoiding your platform, that's bad.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.840
DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom says, I'm still wondering when Kingdom Hearts 3 itself

35:52.840 --> 35:53.840
will come out.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.880
I believe a lot of that is tied to Final Fantasy XIII Versus.

35:56.880 --> 36:02.120
If I remember right, it's the same team that usually does the Kingdom Hearts games.

36:02.120 --> 36:06.360
Part of the reason Kingdom Hearts 3 has been so unheard of is because Kingdom Hearts, or

36:06.360 --> 36:09.720
I'm sorry, Final Fantasy XIII Versus has taken so long.

36:09.720 --> 36:13.760
Next Kingdom Hearts game is also gonna be on DS, recoded, so.

36:13.760 --> 36:17.680
Well then there's the 3DS title too they've got in the works, right?

36:17.680 --> 36:20.080
Yes, there is a 3DS title in the works as well.

36:20.080 --> 36:26.600
I mean, once the 3DS comes out, I think it's just gonna be the final blow for the PSP.

36:26.600 --> 36:30.480
Until they announce the PSP 2, then that might pick things up, but as far as the original

36:30.480 --> 36:31.480
PSP...

36:31.480 --> 36:33.600
Especially with these rumors that it might be the phone as well, is gonna, I think, invigorate

36:33.600 --> 36:34.600
a little bit.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.600
I think it's gonna be something separate.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.480
I don't think it's gonna be a phone integrated into it.

36:37.480 --> 36:42.280
I can see it's something like the iPod Touch or something where it has many of the features

36:42.280 --> 36:46.160
of the phone minus the phone, you know, like the whole marketplace and stuff.

36:46.160 --> 36:52.040
They're probably gonna try to emulate a lot of that stuff, but I don't know.

36:52.040 --> 36:57.840
I guess if you have a PSP, you know, neat that they have another update, which will

36:57.840 --> 37:02.280
probably be cracked in a few days anyways.

37:02.280 --> 37:06.920
But I mean, there's not a lot of titles on the horizon for you guys, unfortunately.

37:06.920 --> 37:11.240
But hey, just wait, don't be tempted by some of these Black Friday sales, which I did see

37:11.240 --> 37:16.800
they had one as a PSP Go for $150 and it came with three games, including like Little Big

37:16.800 --> 37:19.240
Planet and stuff like that.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.880
So that's kind of cool.

37:21.880 --> 37:26.440
But once again, they're just trying to sucker you in so they can clear out inventory.

37:26.440 --> 37:29.760
And really, do you want a PSP Go when it's at the end of its life cycle?

37:29.760 --> 37:33.560
See here's the thing, the solar flare in our chatroom says, I never regret getting my PSP.

37:33.560 --> 37:39.340
And I still think if you don't have a PSP after all this time still, I still think there's

37:39.340 --> 37:44.680
a great back catalog of games that are getting cheaper by the day, as the console is nearing

37:44.680 --> 37:45.680
the end of its life cycle.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.880
I think it's definitely worth looking to go get.

37:47.880 --> 37:51.660
And let's not forget, I've always said, and I think you guys agree, that the PSP's biggest

37:51.660 --> 37:55.640
strength is not necessarily its games library, although that's gotten a lot better, but the

37:55.640 --> 38:02.520
fact that the PSP also plays MP3s, does the movies, does the internets, does...

38:02.520 --> 38:07.320
That's the problem though with the PSP though, is all that stuff, even nowadays with the

38:07.320 --> 38:11.080
new technology that's out there, with the new smartphones and everything, it's getting

38:11.080 --> 38:12.080
really weak.

38:12.080 --> 38:16.680
That's a weak argument now, because before it was like, hey, yeah, I can browse the web,

38:16.680 --> 38:20.720
and yeah, the web browser's kind of crappy, it doesn't support a lot of things, you know.

38:20.720 --> 38:26.280
But now, I mean, a lot of the smartphones and stuff that are coming out, that comparison's

38:26.280 --> 38:29.680
no longer really valid, because everything plays MP3s now.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.900
Everything watches movies.

38:31.900 --> 38:32.900
Everything can...

38:32.900 --> 38:38.840
If you're a gamer, you can't look at the iPhone games and take any of them seriously.

38:38.840 --> 38:45.520
99% of them suck, especially the ones that are like bad, bad, bad ports of real games.

38:45.520 --> 38:48.600
That's true, but also 99% of them are under $20.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.480
Hold on, I think Jamie wanted to jump in here.

38:50.480 --> 38:55.960
No, I was just gonna say, I've been enjoying Final Fantasy II and VI and a lot of games

38:55.960 --> 38:56.960
on there.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.480
But I still think Final Fantasy II is better on the PSP.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.480
Yes, because it has buttons.

39:02.480 --> 39:03.480
Yes.

39:03.480 --> 39:04.480
Yes, exactly.

39:04.480 --> 39:05.480
Exactly.

39:05.480 --> 39:06.480
Their argument, you know, does stand...

39:06.480 --> 39:07.480
But I get it.

39:07.480 --> 39:08.480
You're right.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.480
The price is huge, too.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.480
It's kind of cool, though.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.360
One of the things, actually, I forgot to mention that I did this week, as far as my game stuff,

39:13.360 --> 39:18.600
because I do have a jailbroken iPod, I downloaded an NES emulator on it, which is kind of neat.

39:18.600 --> 39:23.540
But what's neat about it is you can actually, it has support for, via Bluetooth, to sync

39:23.540 --> 39:29.400
a Wii remote to it, to use the Wii remote to play the NES games on.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.280
Just totally random tangent question.

39:31.280 --> 39:34.440
I want to ask Marissa so she doesn't feel left out here, because the Wii is supposed

39:34.440 --> 39:40.280
to be that system that gets everybody, no matter if you're a gamer or not, it's supposed

39:40.280 --> 39:41.280
to reach out to everybody.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.800
Have you ever played the Wii?

39:42.800 --> 39:43.800
Oh, yeah.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.680
Yeah, my dad has the Wii, and he likes my boyfriend to come over to play Mario with

39:47.680 --> 39:49.320
him so he can finally progress in levels.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.800
Now, your boyfriend doesn't try to get you to play Wii Fit while he sits behind you with

39:52.800 --> 39:53.800
a camera, right?

39:53.800 --> 39:54.800
No, but it was...

39:54.800 --> 39:55.800
Okay, just checking.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.600
It was funny.

39:57.600 --> 40:02.320
My dad thought that yoga was for wussies.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.320
The yoga Wii Fit is hard?

40:03.320 --> 40:04.320
Oh, wait, we're on the internet.

40:04.320 --> 40:07.840
My dad, he thought yoga was for pussies until he tried the Wii Fit yoga.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.720
Oh, you can say naughty language on the show.

40:09.720 --> 40:10.720
Oh, yes.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.720
The internet is for porn, so we're not...

40:11.720 --> 40:12.720
That's right.

40:12.720 --> 40:17.520
No, I've played the Wii, but I think the interesting thing is that so many games have come out

40:17.520 --> 40:22.680
now that's not just the emphasis on the shtick of using the motion control anymore.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.200
Which is what a lot of us wanted in the very beginning, actually.

40:25.200 --> 40:28.840
Okay, yay, we get it, there's motion control, now don't go overboard with it.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.840
No, don't.

40:29.840 --> 40:30.840
Stop, stop, you're getting too close to the edge.

40:30.840 --> 40:31.840
Stop!

40:31.840 --> 40:33.320
Hey, you know, it's better than the...

40:33.320 --> 40:36.880
At least the controller's better than the Gamecock, so the PS...

40:36.880 --> 40:39.840
You know there was actually a game company called Gamecock?

40:39.840 --> 40:41.680
I don't even know if they're still around.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.680
I think I heard something about them shutting down.

40:43.680 --> 40:44.680
They're terrible.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.680
Didn't they do the Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game?

40:46.680 --> 40:48.160
That was like their big thing?

40:48.160 --> 40:49.160
Yeah.

40:49.160 --> 40:51.240
Anyhow, moving on.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.280
Let's talk about some other gaming news that doesn't have to do with the PSP.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.280
Let's talk about the Kinect.

40:55.280 --> 40:59.880
We were talking about Japanese and the way things were received in Japan a minute ago.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.600
How about the Kinect launch in Japan?

41:01.600 --> 41:08.800
Well, in Japan, Microsoft's new Kinect sold 26,000 units during the launch weekend of

41:08.800 --> 41:10.200
November 20th.

41:10.200 --> 41:13.600
That includes both standalone and 360-bundle Kinects.

41:13.600 --> 41:19.060
Now here's something to keep in mind, it sold a million of them, I believe, in the rest

41:19.060 --> 41:20.060
of the world.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.360
And it sold 26,000 in Japan.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.500
Now there's a few ways you can kind of break down these numbers.

41:24.500 --> 41:28.080
There's a lot of people that want to jump in there and go, oh, well these numbers mean

41:28.080 --> 41:30.940
the Kinect is a total hardcore failure in Japan.

41:30.940 --> 41:34.320
But then there's another group that goes, well, it's not like the 360 was selling a

41:34.320 --> 41:41.240
bunch in Japan anyway, so the fact that it sold 26,000 is actually pretty good, considering

41:41.240 --> 41:43.900
the user base that exists compared to the rest of the world.

41:43.900 --> 41:48.000
So there's a million ways you can kind of slice it, but regardless, that's what it is.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.360
What I also thought was very interesting, especially to a lot of the audience of this

41:51.360 --> 41:56.200
show, guess what the highest-selling launch title was in Japan?

41:56.200 --> 42:01.080
It was Dance Masters, was the highest-selling launch title in Japan, 6,000 copies of Dance

42:01.080 --> 42:02.080
Masters.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.080
That sounds surprising.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.080
They like their Para Para.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.480
Well, keep in mind, they also don't have Dance Central, because Dance Central was a very

42:07.480 --> 42:13.460
kind of American type of game, especially when it comes to the licenses.

42:13.460 --> 42:19.080
Being that Dance Masters relied pretty much completely on Konami originals and Avex songs

42:19.080 --> 42:23.400
that I'm sure were dirt cheap to license here in the US, you pretty much have the same game

42:23.400 --> 42:25.280
overseas that you have here.

42:25.280 --> 42:28.320
So very interesting, the way that worked out.

42:28.320 --> 42:35.300
But that almost sounds to me like I'm not so sure the Kinect in Japan has that must-have

42:35.300 --> 42:36.300
title.

42:36.300 --> 42:42.300
I mean, not to slam on Dance Masters, but I think that a game like Dance Central, maybe

42:42.300 --> 42:47.240
localized with J-pop hits and songs that are big in Japan, might do well.

42:47.240 --> 42:51.040
I mean, heck, probably even a lot of the songs that are in it already, I know there's a lot

42:51.040 --> 42:56.680
of the kind of cross-culture going on there, probably would do a lot better.

42:56.680 --> 42:59.120
So I don't know, I'm kind of interested.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.120
Does anybody kind of read into those numbers at all?

43:01.120 --> 43:03.080
What do you guys think about those numbers?

43:03.080 --> 43:05.200
Is that a good launch, or is that a shitty launch?

43:05.200 --> 43:09.480
Well, they just have a really small install base in Japan, so I'm not surprised that the

43:09.480 --> 43:17.000
numbers are a lot smaller than we have over here in the North American regions.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.720
Let's say that's not bad, considering.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.720
So we'll see.

43:21.720 --> 43:27.160
I mean, it's so interesting now, kind of where we're at in this generation, where the PlayStation

43:27.160 --> 43:30.560
is such the bigger deal over in Japan, I'd be more curious, and I haven't seen these

43:30.560 --> 43:34.020
numbers yet, as to how the move is doing over there compared to here, because I bet it's

43:34.020 --> 43:35.020
doing better.

43:35.020 --> 43:39.080
It is doing way better than that, because there's more of an installed base.

43:39.080 --> 43:40.080
Right.

43:40.080 --> 43:43.880
But is it doing better there than it is here, comparatively?

43:43.880 --> 43:44.880
I don't think so.

43:44.880 --> 43:45.880
Hmm.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.040
I'd be curious.

43:47.040 --> 43:52.360
Anyway, that's all I really had, Kinect launched in Japan, and we'll see what games come out

43:52.360 --> 43:57.080
over there, and what all gets localized for Japan, or vice versa, perhaps.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.360
I just actually found something really sad just now.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.360
What's that?

44:00.360 --> 44:01.360
Leslie Nielsen died.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.360
Oh no!

44:02.360 --> 44:03.360
The guy from Airplane?

44:03.360 --> 44:04.360
The Naked Gun?

44:04.360 --> 44:05.360
Yeah.

44:05.360 --> 44:06.360
No!

44:06.360 --> 44:07.360
He was getting really old, I mean.

44:07.360 --> 44:10.360
Yeah, but I just happened to look and- That's horrible.

44:10.360 --> 44:11.360
Sad.

44:11.360 --> 44:12.360
That's a bummer.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.360
Yeah, he was funny.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.560
Way to bring down the show.

44:14.560 --> 44:17.120
How about some happy news?

44:17.120 --> 44:20.160
Let's talk about Marisa's boobs some more, that'll cheer me up.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.920
So Marisa- No, I'm kidding.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.280
I can see your dirty pillows.

44:24.280 --> 44:29.240
Actually, my gamer news is that Eidos needs to- well, Eidos is dead now.

44:29.240 --> 44:32.600
I'm still waiting for Thief 4 for the rest of Eternity, and it looks like they're implying

44:32.600 --> 44:35.280
that they're gonna get rid of Garrett and make it a girl, and I'm pissed.

44:35.280 --> 44:39.600
Well, Eidos kinda got sucked into Square Enix, because like, you know, Tomb Raider is still

44:39.600 --> 44:42.360
getting cranked out, but it's now by Square Enix.

44:42.360 --> 44:48.400
And actually, the last arcade game they did anyway was really good, so, you know, there's

44:48.400 --> 44:49.400
always hope.

44:49.400 --> 44:52.400
You know, cross those fingers.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.400
How about something happy?

44:53.400 --> 44:55.120
How about something happy?

44:55.120 --> 44:59.720
Well, BBC America is having programming available on PlayStation Network.

44:59.720 --> 45:05.880
There will be the first episode of the US version of Top Gear, which is normally $1.99

45:05.880 --> 45:13.320
SD or $2.99 HD, and that's gonna be up there for the first two weeks for free, and Dan

45:13.320 --> 45:14.600
said it was actually really good.

45:14.600 --> 45:18.520
He's a big Top Gear fan, so he said it was really up there.

45:18.520 --> 45:19.720
It gets the Dan stamp of approval.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.280
It gets the Dan stamp of approval.

45:21.280 --> 45:22.280
Very nice.

45:22.280 --> 45:29.720
Also, Doctor Who and Being Human will be up there on the launch list, and I'm sure everyone's

45:29.720 --> 45:34.400
heard me go off about Doctor Who, about how awesome it is, but Being Human is a really,

45:34.400 --> 45:35.400
really cool show.

45:35.400 --> 45:42.520
It sounds kind of cheesy about a werewolf and his vampire friend moving into a flat

45:42.520 --> 45:46.560
that happens to be haunted by this girl that was killed there.

45:46.560 --> 45:49.640
So yeah, a werewolf, a ghost, and a vampire live together.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.360
Walk into a bar?

45:51.360 --> 45:52.360
No.

45:52.360 --> 45:53.360
Oh.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.480
But actually, it's a really good drama.

45:55.480 --> 46:00.480
I actually really like it, so it's one I recommend to people to watch, but they're gonna be adding

46:00.480 --> 46:04.520
more BBC shows on there.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.520
I'm hoping to see Primeval show up.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.280
That's another good show.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.200
So that's really cool.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.240
That makes me happy.

46:11.240 --> 46:14.440
That means that I actually have a reason to use my PlayStation Store since I don't have

46:14.440 --> 46:16.680
cable.

46:16.680 --> 46:17.680
Just cable internets.

46:17.680 --> 46:22.280
Then again, I also have the internet.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.280
Shh.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.840
We're not supposed to be encouraging that here on this program.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.240
What are you talking about?

46:28.240 --> 46:29.440
Just watch streaming BBC TV.

46:29.440 --> 46:31.440
There you go.

46:31.440 --> 46:35.200
So the chat room is kind of reacting to the whole news about Leslie Nielsen.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.680
He's 84 years old.

46:37.680 --> 46:39.160
I didn't realize he was that old.

46:39.160 --> 46:40.440
He was old.

46:40.440 --> 46:43.720
He was at least 60 when those Naked Gun movies came out in the 90s.

46:43.720 --> 46:45.600
But he didn't age ever.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.080
He's on our chat room, says, Happy news.

46:48.080 --> 46:51.640
Leslie Nielsen is now a zombie, and there's a new Naked Gun in the works.

46:51.640 --> 46:52.640
So there you go.

46:52.640 --> 46:53.640
Oh, that's...

46:53.640 --> 46:56.960
It'll probably be funnier than the last one.

46:56.960 --> 46:58.200
The last one was awesome.

46:58.200 --> 47:00.840
Last one had OJ Simpson in upset.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.120
They all had OJ Simpson.

47:02.120 --> 47:04.640
He was funny back then.

47:04.640 --> 47:06.080
The last movie he did was...

47:06.080 --> 47:09.360
I don't even remember what the hell it was called, but it ended up where he was some

47:09.360 --> 47:15.640
sort of detective on the moon or something like that, and there was some weird shit.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.780
The only movie that I think he's done that I really didn't care for was Dracula Dead

47:18.780 --> 47:22.120
and Loving It, which is also sad because it was a Mel Brooks movie, too, and it wasn't

47:22.120 --> 47:24.120
all that good.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
Sadness.

47:25.120 --> 47:29.380
I can't say that there was a movie that he did that I did not like.

47:29.380 --> 47:36.080
I'd say maybe Mr. Magoo, but I never watched that, but I don't really care for Mr. Magoo.

47:36.080 --> 47:39.120
They said he was being treated for pneumonia.

47:39.120 --> 47:40.120
Aww.

47:40.120 --> 47:41.880
Damn you, pneumonia!

47:41.880 --> 47:42.880
Damn you!

47:42.880 --> 47:45.560
Can you believe that Zsa Zsa Gabor outlived him?

47:45.560 --> 47:46.560
Like, damn it!

47:46.560 --> 47:47.560
Really?

47:47.560 --> 47:48.560
Take her instead!

47:48.560 --> 47:51.920
No, I mean, she's had one foot in for, like, how many months now?

47:51.920 --> 47:55.920
I mean, not to sound horrible and crass, but, like, there's all these, like, pictures of

47:55.920 --> 47:59.680
her on the internets, like, just not looking good at all.

47:59.680 --> 48:03.400
Pneumonia, you know you have a target now.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.760
Take out Zsa Zsa.

48:04.760 --> 48:05.760
Stop.

48:05.760 --> 48:06.760
Stop.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.920
You don't encourage that sort of thing to happen to old ladies.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.920
It's Zsa Zsa Gabor!

48:10.920 --> 48:12.320
Come on!

48:12.320 --> 48:13.320
Seriously.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.320
Wow.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.320
Alright.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.320
Let's move on, please.

48:16.320 --> 48:17.320
Next.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.320
Video games, hello, video games.

48:18.320 --> 48:22.840
I mean, she's like the Paris Hilton of a long time ago.

48:22.840 --> 48:23.840
Completely pointless.

48:23.840 --> 48:28.400
Married nine times.

48:28.400 --> 48:32.880
Kinect support is coming to the XNA in the future.

48:32.880 --> 48:39.720
Apparently, developers will be getting the tools to make games supporting the Kinect.

48:39.720 --> 48:41.720
Just not right now.

48:41.720 --> 48:48.560
They said that they're pleased to see developers tinkering around with, to a degree, the device,

48:48.560 --> 48:55.040
and, of course, they're saying that Microsoft classifies as someone accessing algorithms

48:55.040 --> 49:00.240
on the side of the Xbox for ill use or someone explaining the Kinect in a cheating manner

49:00.240 --> 49:01.240
not tolerable.

49:01.240 --> 49:06.520
Of course, they're saying, you know, creating a driver that might open the USB connection

49:06.520 --> 49:12.200
or, you know, read C inputs from the sensor, on the other hand, are totally cool with Microsoft.

49:12.200 --> 49:16.520
They're kind of referring to, you know, some of the homebrew hacks that people have done

49:16.520 --> 49:24.240
on their PC, and they said they have no timetable when Kinect support will come to the XNA,

49:24.240 --> 49:28.880
but it possibly will, so.

49:28.880 --> 49:34.000
I imagine they will at some point, I mean, they're gonna want people, you know, taking

49:34.000 --> 49:36.160
advantage of their peripherals.

49:36.160 --> 49:42.760
That'd be like saying, you know, we're not really gonna give you the algorithms and the

49:42.760 --> 49:46.840
device drivers to use our controllers, but you can make games.

49:46.840 --> 49:49.360
You just can't have anything to control them.

49:49.360 --> 49:53.280
You know, maybe they're afraid that the indie developers are gonna make better games than

49:53.280 --> 49:54.280
what's out there right now.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.020
That wouldn't be that difficult.

49:56.020 --> 50:00.320
When you open it up to the public, there's gonna be all those ideas, you know, and there's

50:00.320 --> 50:03.760
gonna be somebody that thinks of something that the publishers have been too afraid to

50:03.760 --> 50:06.680
do and are gonna come up with that must-have game.

50:06.680 --> 50:08.840
You know what I mean?

50:08.840 --> 50:12.120
Which reminds me, we actually need to do, we need to do something a little bit out of

50:12.120 --> 50:15.000
order and out of character here on Orange Laundraido, but I need to go to the Twitters

50:15.000 --> 50:16.800
real quick.

50:16.800 --> 50:19.240
I'm actually going to Twitter topics a little bit early in the show.

50:19.240 --> 50:23.120
I'm not gonna do them all, but there's one particular Twitter that caught my attention

50:23.120 --> 50:26.480
before the show tonight, and it has to do with XNA and all this stuff.

50:26.480 --> 50:29.880
So I'm going to the Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and I want to read some tweets from

50:29.880 --> 50:30.880
Blue Swim.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.880
Hey, you ready?

50:32.880 --> 50:35.080
Blue Swim had asked us a question on Twitter.

50:35.080 --> 50:41.880
Have any of you played the Xbox Live indie game, Techno Kitten Adventure?

50:41.880 --> 50:48.680
Kitten plus jetpack plus club music plus rainbows plus pink ponies equals win.

50:48.680 --> 50:53.920
And he actually sent us a little YouTube here of what the game in motion looks like.

50:53.920 --> 50:58.440
And of course, that doesn't make for great radio, but just to give you an idea, here's

50:58.440 --> 51:02.600
what the soundtrack sounds like.

51:02.600 --> 51:13.240
Now, to tell you what's going on in the game, there's a little kitten on a jetpack flying

51:13.240 --> 51:19.560
through different obstacles, and he's dodging these pink unicorns that are flying at him,

51:19.560 --> 51:24.240
and these UFOs, and falling stars, which are referenced in the song, if you listen to the

51:24.240 --> 51:27.440
lyrics of the song, and these little boats with color tracks.

51:27.440 --> 51:28.960
I don't think he actually has to dodge all that.

51:28.960 --> 51:31.200
I think it's just the blocks that he has to dodge.

51:31.200 --> 51:33.320
The rest is just background.

51:33.320 --> 51:38.960
This is kind of like robot unicorn attack, but like 10 times more awesome.

51:38.960 --> 51:44.640
I like the stars.

51:44.640 --> 51:48.120
And whenever he crashes into objects, he goes, meow.

51:48.120 --> 51:50.240
Look at the high scores.

51:50.240 --> 51:53.240
It's like a bad like, what is it, YTMD or something.

51:53.240 --> 51:56.360
If you were high, this game would just make you pass out.

51:56.360 --> 51:59.080
Like seriously, I just don't even know.

51:59.080 --> 52:05.040
So my point is, this is quite possibly the most amazing thing I've ever seen someone

52:05.040 --> 52:07.360
do on the Xbox 360.

52:07.360 --> 52:12.040
And it's on the Indie, in fact, I've decided we are going to track this guy down and get

52:12.040 --> 52:16.200
him on the show, whoever made this game, because I need to know more about this right now.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.240
Right now.

52:18.240 --> 52:25.120
And obviously, the publishers and the big Activisions and EAs of the world are too afraid

52:25.120 --> 52:32.520
of Techno Kitten Adventure and getting their, you know, multi-millions from I'm sure what

52:32.520 --> 52:35.880
this is going to sell on the Indie marketplace.

52:35.880 --> 52:36.880
Amazing.

52:36.880 --> 52:37.880
Techno Kitten Adventure.

52:37.880 --> 52:38.880
There you go.

52:38.880 --> 52:41.880
God damn, that was amazing.

52:41.880 --> 52:43.160
Thank you to Blue Swim for pointing that out.

52:43.160 --> 52:46.520
I am immediately going home and buying that after the show, just so you know.

52:46.520 --> 52:48.520
I will too buy that.

52:48.520 --> 52:49.520
Look at that.

52:49.520 --> 52:50.520
Look at that.

52:50.520 --> 52:53.840
You just sold two copies off that game and how hard could that game have possibly been

52:53.840 --> 52:54.840
to me?

52:54.840 --> 52:57.120
It was a thing off of X and A for a long time.

52:57.120 --> 53:03.520
But it was an idea that no one else had thought of yet or was too afraid to do.

53:03.520 --> 53:05.000
I don't know.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
And I won't.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.760
That game, that game scared Shermie out of the room.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.000
Hold on.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.400
Oh, the chatters are like, what is this link now?

53:13.400 --> 53:14.400
Send us link.

53:14.400 --> 53:15.400
Here you go.

53:15.400 --> 53:16.400
I'll give you the same link Blue Swim gave me.

53:16.400 --> 53:17.400
There you go.

53:17.400 --> 53:18.400
I'll put watch now.

53:18.400 --> 53:19.400
All right.

53:19.400 --> 53:20.400
There you go.

53:20.400 --> 53:22.400
I just put that there.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.200
Yizam in the chat says, President Jetpack Cat.

53:26.200 --> 53:29.880
Act F says, we have our new president cat and it has a jetpack.

53:29.880 --> 53:32.560
Orange Right says, Jetpack Cat.

53:32.560 --> 53:33.800
Sure.

53:33.800 --> 53:34.800
We endorse this.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.440
Jetpack Cat.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.440
President Cat's cousin.

53:38.440 --> 53:41.640
In fact, I will make a tweet right now.

53:41.640 --> 53:42.640
Right now.

53:42.640 --> 53:44.000
President Cat's cousin, Jetpack Cat.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.440
You must get this game right now.

53:46.440 --> 53:47.440
There you go.

53:47.440 --> 53:48.440
Some, some indie guy is going to be like WTF.

53:48.440 --> 53:49.440
All right.

53:49.440 --> 53:52.080
Anyhow, let me get into another story here.

53:52.080 --> 53:58.360
There's a link right there and a chat, Alphana Kananagram did a, you know, cause now you can

53:58.360 --> 54:00.820
of course set everything up to download.

54:00.820 --> 54:01.820
Thank you.

54:01.820 --> 54:05.040
See, you know, what's funny is that like half our listeners are going to buy it tonight

54:05.040 --> 54:08.640
and then like the guy's going to go in like, wait, how did I sell all these games last

54:08.640 --> 54:09.640
night?

54:09.640 --> 54:10.640
All right.

54:10.640 --> 54:14.760
Put that link on our website, then you can see the refers.

54:14.760 --> 54:16.040
Going viral kids.

54:16.040 --> 54:17.040
All right.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.040
Anyhow.

54:18.040 --> 54:20.240
Um, moving on to something completely different.

54:20.240 --> 54:24.880
This is like, like after that last little game, this seems like such shit.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.120
This is about 3d games.

54:26.120 --> 54:28.200
Like I don't even care about 3d games anymore.

54:28.200 --> 54:31.200
If they don't have jet pack kittens who fucking cares.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.200
But whatever.

54:32.200 --> 54:34.360
Sony seems to think that 3d is the place to be.

54:34.360 --> 54:38.760
So um, if you, but, but, but wait, what did you see the box art?

54:38.760 --> 54:42.840
No, I didn't.

54:42.840 --> 54:51.840
Can you try to describe the box art cause it is a radio show, the box art is of a little

54:51.840 --> 54:59.160
kitten, um, staring up at something that looks really fucking trippy and it's, it's awesome.

54:59.160 --> 55:04.360
And of course their little, uh, description, it says, uh, navigate a kitten by jet pack

55:04.360 --> 55:09.360
fueled by hopes and dreams through a fantastical world of techno, techno music feature.

55:09.360 --> 55:11.160
I want him on our show.

55:11.160 --> 55:12.160
Who made this game?

55:12.160 --> 55:18.880
I want him on the show next week or her featuring DJ Hicksie, sea of love, uh, Frisco all around

55:18.880 --> 55:19.880
the world.

55:19.880 --> 55:20.880
Production's limited.

55:20.880 --> 55:22.240
Who made this game?

55:22.240 --> 55:23.240
Bring them to me.

55:23.240 --> 55:33.200
Ol army, find me this person and bring them to mono X mono X is laughing over there.

55:33.200 --> 55:34.200
She's dying.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.200
You're right.

55:35.200 --> 55:36.200
That's awesome.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.280
That's awesome.

55:37.280 --> 55:43.400
I'm going to submit this image of the box art to our, uh, image field there.

55:43.400 --> 55:48.480
So fueled by hopes and dreams.

55:48.480 --> 55:49.480
Blue swim.

55:49.480 --> 55:52.640
If this is a friend of yours, I want them on the show now.

55:52.640 --> 55:53.640
Bring them to me.

55:53.640 --> 55:54.640
All right.

55:54.640 --> 55:59.560
Let me bathe him and bring him.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.560
He is being summoned to our castle.

56:01.560 --> 56:02.560
All right.

56:02.560 --> 56:03.560
Uh, anyhow.

56:03.560 --> 56:04.560
Yeah.

56:04.560 --> 56:05.560
Sony, 3d, whatever.

56:05.560 --> 56:06.560
Who cares anymore?

56:06.560 --> 56:09.400
Anyway, if you're like, Oh gee, I don't want to play the techno kitten game.

56:09.400 --> 56:13.000
I want to play 3d games on my 3d TV cause I'm rich bitch.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.400
And I got 3d televisions.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.000
Well, good news for you.

56:16.000 --> 56:22.680
Sony is, uh, taking a lot of the games on the PlayStation three and making them 3d 20

56:22.680 --> 56:26.720
games internally at Sony alone are going to be converted for the 3d TV.

56:26.720 --> 56:31.080
A quote here from Mick Hawking with Sony computer entertainment, Europe.

56:31.080 --> 56:35.600
Overall we have more than 50 titles currently being converted into 3d and this number is

56:35.600 --> 56:36.800
growing fast.

56:36.800 --> 56:38.360
Some of them are massive names.

56:38.360 --> 56:41.640
That's a really, really good sign that the industry is behind our unique message that

56:41.640 --> 56:45.200
3d is a key element in the future of home consoles.

56:45.200 --> 56:49.480
Is it just me or do I kind of read that as, well, you know, the 3ds everybody's got a

56:49.480 --> 56:50.480
boner about.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.960
So 3d must be the future.

56:51.960 --> 56:52.960
Is that kind of, I don't know.

56:52.960 --> 56:53.960
Maybe that's just what I read.

56:53.960 --> 56:56.320
And this would be Sony saying this, uh, yeah.

56:56.320 --> 56:58.280
Mick Hawking was Sony computer entertainment Europe.

56:58.280 --> 57:03.280
That's odd that they would think that 3d is the future of air attainment because Sony

57:03.280 --> 57:07.120
makes 3d TVs.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.120
That's so crazy.

57:08.120 --> 57:13.000
And that they would have 3d Blu-rays that they'd be pushing for their console.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
And uh, yeah, biased much.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.880
By the way, over 53d games in development overall, 20 of them are just the internals

57:21.880 --> 57:22.960
there at Sony.

57:22.960 --> 57:26.000
So a 3d is the wave of the future.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Everybody.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
There you go.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.400
I have officially purchased Techno, I need to make a tweet about that, but I've been

57:32.400 --> 57:33.400
reading the news.

57:33.400 --> 57:37.640
So I need DarkSakura to do a news story so I can go to the Twitters.

57:37.640 --> 57:43.040
Well how about something about piece of shit 14, I mean Final Fantasy 14.

57:43.040 --> 57:46.920
It looks like they're actually going to be doing an update to it.

57:46.920 --> 57:54.840
It's going to be fixing the skill point allocation, UI response time, more accessible user interface.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.120
There's actually a lot of stuff up on their official website.

57:57.120 --> 58:00.720
But basically everyone said, it's crap!

58:00.720 --> 58:08.280
So the Square Enix VP of software development, Hiromichi Tanaka said, the development team

58:08.280 --> 58:12.480
is working really hard to bring it back to the level we plan to have ready for the players.

58:12.480 --> 58:16.520
Yeah, in fact there's a whole bunch of updates ready for it.

58:16.520 --> 58:24.260
According to the site, and I'm trying to pull all the information up, more tutorials, more

58:24.260 --> 58:29.640
stuff to some of the scenarios, yes no confirmation prompt when you're selecting a path companion,

58:29.640 --> 58:35.440
difficulties have been adjusted, lots of stuff.

58:35.440 --> 58:38.920
So let me know if it's less crappy people.

58:38.920 --> 58:40.840
Did they patch in fun?

58:40.840 --> 58:42.840
Is fun in one of the bullet points?

58:42.840 --> 58:45.400
There's one that says collecting seashells.

58:45.400 --> 58:47.840
That sounds kind of stupid.

58:47.840 --> 58:50.440
Maximum HP has been increased.

58:50.440 --> 58:51.440
What about kittens with jetpacks?

58:51.440 --> 58:54.200
Do we have any of those yet?

58:54.200 --> 58:56.200
Let me see kittens, kittens, kittens, kittens.

58:56.200 --> 59:01.880
Game idea man, you won't believe this, kittens, jetpacks.

59:01.880 --> 59:05.560
Nothing about kittens.

59:05.560 --> 59:07.560
Nothing about kittens, Rob.

59:07.560 --> 59:08.560
Fail!

59:08.560 --> 59:09.560
Fail.

59:09.560 --> 59:14.040
Well, actually though, Final Fantasy does have the Mithra, or whatever they're calling

59:14.040 --> 59:18.080
them now in Final Fantasy XIV, maybe they changed the name to Mazithra, I don't know.

59:18.080 --> 59:20.320
But the kitten people, the cat people.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.840
Isn't Mazithra like a pasta or something like that?

59:22.840 --> 59:23.840
It's kind of cheese.

59:23.840 --> 59:25.040
It's my favorite dish.

59:25.040 --> 59:27.040
My favorite dish at the Old Spaghetti Factory.

59:27.040 --> 59:34.360
That's right, cheese sauce, oh my god, you were talking about that before the show.

59:34.360 --> 59:40.480
Favorite dish.

59:40.480 --> 59:43.320
I hope your boyfriend isn't listening because you might get that line when you get home.

59:43.320 --> 59:48.800
Hey, it's time for Mazithra con gusto.

59:48.800 --> 59:49.800
That's right.

59:49.800 --> 59:52.560
And he's long hair Chris, so he might have.

59:52.560 --> 59:55.400
Sorry boys, she's taken.

59:55.400 --> 01:00:02.760
Anyhow, let's move on, talk about some release dates of other games that are coming out around

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.080
the world and will start off in the US, although things are starting to slow down a little

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.080
bit, right?

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.080
That would be correct.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.760
Not a lot this week, and thankfully not a lot of crappy games I can talk about.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:19.240
But there's a few, so we'll talk about Chevrolet Camaro Wild Ride, which I'm sure is awesome,

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.320
that's coming out on the Wii.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.600
Deadliest Catch, Sea of Chaos, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:32.480
you better believe that the Xbox 360 will be supporting the Kinect and the PS3 The Move.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:39.960
Sniper Elite on the Nintendo Wii, let's see here.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.040
Game called Nailed, that's supposed to be a pretty awesome ATV off-road racing game

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.400
that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:59.360
Epic Mickey on the Wii, game called Spell Force 2, Faith in Destiny, that's on PC, and

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:07.400
Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, coming out on DS this week, and that is it.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.720
Oh, there's still some big titles in there, I thought Epic Mickey had already come out.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.480
No, it's coming out this week.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.880
And it looks like Hello Kitty Seasons was delayed another week, that is now coming out

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.880
this week.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880
Yippie skippy.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.960
Alright, let's go over to Japan.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:28.680
I'm sorry, real quick, this isn't a game, but the wireless Pro Guitar for the Wii is

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.320
coming out this week.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.880
Alright, moving on to Japan and the Japanese release dates.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.600
Things are slowing down a tad over there as well, but there are still some games.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.400
Battlefield Bad Company 2 gets the Ultimate Edition, that's the Japanese version, not

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.080
an import, that comes out in Japan this week.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:51.880
December the 2nd, also going on to the PlayStation 3, there's a few games on there.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.520
There's Battlefield Bad Company there.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.660
Dante's Inferno gets a price reduction, so does Killzone 2.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:02.020
Hokuto Musou International comes out this week, as well as Fusa Sarita Shibuya Dei,

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.480
that's a price reduction as well.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:09.220
A new game called Tales of Graces F, that's from Namco Bandai, comes out this week.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.600
I'm assuming that is in the Tales of Graces series.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:18.220
Oh, it was a Wii game originally, and they're saying it's not just a port, it actually expands

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:23.240
the world and adds a whole new epilogue to the game, so neat.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:29.440
On other platforms, this week in Japan, looking at the Nintendo Wii, trying to see if there's

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.440
anything.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.440
Just Taiko No Tatsujin, some of our music game fans like that game.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.480
Mina Da Party comes out this week.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:42.040
Naruto Shippuden, Gekkoto Ninja Taisen Special comes out this week, and Babysitter Mama is

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.600
a big release this week in Japan.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:50.240
I saw the babies for that at Kmart.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.440
They do kind of look like Cooking Mama had a baby.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440
Yeah, they do.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.680
I always thought Cooking Mama's uterus had dried up, like I thought she was older than

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.960
that, but apparently not.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.560
It does come with a baby that you can actually hold.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.520
I wonder if they'll start using those for the home ec class, where you're supposed to

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.800
take care of a baby and stuff.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.160
My little sister did that, and she was the type of girl that laid out all her outfits

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.200
for a week and looked all perfect, and by the end of the week with that crying electronic

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.760
baby, her hair looked like shit, and she was wearing sweatpants every day.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.760
It was beautiful.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.720
I'm sorry, but in this screenshot in the game, is she throwing a baby?

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.600
Like what's happening in this picture?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.640
There's some type of like, throw the wiimote this way.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.540
It's like baby tossing into a hot frying pan or something.

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.960
Is she cooking the baby?

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:39.760
It's a liver, a nice candy.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.100
I'm going to put that in our chat room.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.100
You come up with your own opinions.

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.960
I'm sorry, it looks like she's throwing the baby into a pot.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.360
You know how to throw the baby.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.280
What are they teaching the kids over there in Japan?

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:57.080
Alright, in all seriousness, some other games on the Sony PSP this week, Kamen Rider Climax

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:06.520
Heroes OOO, ooh, that's really the name of the game, Kamen Rider Climax Heroes, ooh,

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:13.480
Climax Heroes, ooh, Riders from Cougar to Oz, Cougar, breaks through the boundaries

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.560
that separates their series in this game, it's a fighting game, and it's powered up

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.880
the men with more skills.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:28.720
LocoRoco2 gets a price reduction on the PSP, that's it, I'm spent, that's it for releases

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.960
this week in Japan.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.840
How about UK?

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:38.120
We have a few things, on the 30th, Super Meat Boy for PC, and then on December 1st we have

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:45.600
Dead Nation, on the 3rd we have Ace Combat 11, Skies of Incursion, BlazBlue Continuum

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:51.280
Shift, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition,

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.440
and the Sly Collection.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440
That's about it.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.440
Few biggies.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.320
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then we're gonna get to the classic game

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.120
of the week, but first, Loki.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.760
By the way, um, I found a way to contact the guy.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.760
Did you?

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760
Yes.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.040
Alright, we'll get to that later.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.040
We'll talk offline.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.040
Yes.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:26.160
Okay, so, uh, fun stuff, um, this is kinda neat, uh, CD Projekt, that's spelled P-R-O-J-E-K-T,

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:33.800
like Jekt, as in Final Fantasy X, um, they're fighting Witcher 2 Piracy with a threat of

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.280
a fine.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:41.400
That's right, there's not gonna be any DRM in the actual title, but if they find out

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:46.080
that you're pirating the game, they're going to hunt you down.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:52.360
They say, it says, we are signing with legal firms and torrent sneaking companies to hunt

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.080
down gamers who download The Witcher 2 unlawfully.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:00.880
Such offenders will be sent a letter demanding they pay a fine, the sum of which was left

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:07.000
unspecified, though it sounds they'll be more than the game's suggested retail price, and

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.240
uh, it says, we don't want to be harsh, um, but there's a chance that this might happen

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.920
to some people if they downloaded it legally, or in other words, um, I guess, don't make

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.120
them mad.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.800
So is this like policing through fear?

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.800
Or what exactly is the deal?

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.240
It sounds like it, it's, honestly though, I don't think that they're gonna be able to

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:34.720
follow through with this, you know what I mean, cause that, uh, I don't know.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.840
It seems like an awful lot, I mean, and considering that as soon as this gets pirated, it's gonna

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.560
be all over the place, it's gonna be a little hard to track down every single person that's

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.080
downloaded it, so, I say it's more of an empty threat if you ask me.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.080
They may try, but.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:54.740
Or they'll make an example of one, like they did that one chick that was in Wisconsin or

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:58.960
whatever, that, you know, some mom that they took to court over some crappy songs that

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.500
she downloaded and they want to put her through the ringer for like two million dollars or

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.840
whatever it is, you know, crazy.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:10.520
Well, just, here's what you do, you just don't download it on a torrent site, because they

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:18.560
get you for sharing, and so therefore, you know, you're, you know, I guess, pirating

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.080
stuff or you're sharing it with other people so they can claim a loss that's more than

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.080
the retail copy of the game, but if you download it like a direct download or something like

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:32.320
that, really they're only losing one copy, so, it'd be a harder argument for them.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.400
And I don't think they can really track you that well.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.040
And who really gives a crap about The Witcher 2 anyways?

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.580
That's my opinion.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:42.880
Did a pic of Marissa's boobs go off on the internet or something, because I just noticed

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880
the chat.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:48.400
I thought that she sent me the picture for the sake of showing the listeners.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.900
But it was for your private collection.

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.500
It is not the entire boobs, they're- I thought it would be a good promo for the

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.500
afterbirth.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.500
New album art.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.680
Hang out for the boobs.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:04.200
Drama says, god damn, those are some tig ol' biddies.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:10.680
They actually look bigger, because of the way I'm posing that photo.

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.000
Just let them believe whatever they want.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Let them believe whatever they want.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Don't get rid of their help!

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.800
It does suck when you wake up in the morning and you hit yourself in the face, but...

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.800
You know what, though?

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.880
You know, despite all the fun we're having, sometimes the tig ol' biddies can kind of

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.880
be a pain in the ass.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.000
Like, it's not all fun and games.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Pain in the ass?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
More like a pain in the back.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Exactly.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Alright.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Anyhow.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.080
Do we mention she's a musician as well and you should buy her music if you're gonna,

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.760
like, be all like, uh, boobies?

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:41.760
Alright, anyhow.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.880
No, I actually, this is kind of a serious story, and this kind of shit just makes me

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.880
so angry.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.440
I want to talk about this for a minute, because this is serious, so less titties, more serious.

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:57.560
This is about something going on in Call of Duty's black ops, and I guess, and again,

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.160
these are not usually the type of games I play, but I guess there is a mode where you

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:06.520
can design your own logos and these logos will kind of go on the, like, you know, on

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.400
the uniforms of the people that you are controlling.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.040
Well, of course, give a guy a pen and paper and eventually some asshole on the internet

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:20.380
is going to take a swastika and put that on their character to make their soldiers look

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.380
like Nazis.

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.480
Because apparently, to somebody, that's hilarious.

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:30.600
Well, uh, Steven Toulouse, who is, uh, one of the heads of Xbox Live, doesn't find it

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:36.240
funny at all and says, quote, it's not political correctness, it's fundamental respect.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.320
If you think the swastika symbol should be reevaluated by societies all over the earth,

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.520
I think that's great.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.860
Your Xbox Live profile or in-game logo, which doesn't have the context to explain your goal,

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:47.560
is not the right place to do that.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.160
And by the way, that doesn't just go for the swastika, it applies to many other symbols

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.040
as well that my team does indeed take action on when we see it.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.080
So in other words, the point of the story, if you are going to be one of these jackasses

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:04.080
who puts a swastika on your outfit and goes in order, or whatever it is, if it's, uh,

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.880
you know, uh, I hate homos or 9-11 was a lie or I don't know, whatever that stuff is you're

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.400
going to put on there, then, uh, they're, they're going to ban you if it's just like

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.060
overtly offensive, such as this symbol is.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:21.040
And I totally agree with the guy, like, and there's going to be those people that are

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:26.280
like, whoa, we're supposed to have the right to free speeches.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.520
You are on a private network.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:33.860
And part of the terms of service is don't be a douchebag and I'm sorry, but if you're

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:39.720
putting this logo, you're only doing it to provoke a reaction of some sort.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.400
You're just trying to be a douchebag.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.760
There's really no nice way to say it.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.080
You're just trying to cause a little controversy and be a douchebag.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.920
Can't you just play the fucking game?

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.040
Like seriously, like why do people have to just be dicks?

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.720
You know, draw a penis.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.500
Penises aren't offensive.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.160
Draw a cunt if that makes you feel better.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.360
Draw Marissa's boobies if you want those.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.320
That's, that's a, that's not offensive at all.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.320
That'd take up a lot.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:12.560
I can't believe though in Call of Duty already, they've managed to, uh, uh, black ops, everything

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:18.220
is a, everything is a dick or my boyfriend's icon is humping bunnies and yeah, it's just

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:22.840
ever since, you know, uh, you know, prehistoric times, you see ancient cave paintings of penises

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.440
that just continues to this day.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.720
There you go.

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.960
So you know what, especially in a war game, it's just unappropriate.

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:31.960
Thank you very much.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.960
He-man stuff.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:41.760
I, again, Act Deaf in our chat room says, don't be a douchebag should really be there

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.120
textual in the terms of service.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:47.080
So you know, you know what I say?

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:53.240
Since I'm not offended by the symbol itself, it's been used in many cultures.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.880
It's a good luck charm in many of them.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:02.840
It's on American, um, uh, architecture from before, you know, 1942.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.960
But when you have it up there in black on a white background with red around it, that's

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.680
saying something and that's offensive.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.600
Especially in the context of a war game.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.600
Exactly.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.240
It's like, you know what you're doing, you know, these, these guys, and I'm sure there's

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.720
these guys, what about my freedom of speech and you know, what are, you know, it's just

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.720
a symbol.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.720
You can go on the street and yell whatever you want.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.720
Yeah.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.200
You agree to the terms you play by them.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.200
Exactly.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.240
You know what, if you want to display whatever you want to, then you can do it without, you

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.440
know, their service.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.220
You don't have to pay for it.

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:43.980
You know, here's the thing, if you are the type of person that just feels this need to

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:49.240
provoke people with the symbol, why don't you stop hiding behind your X-Box and why

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.400
don't you go out onto the street and yell, I love Hitler and see what happens to you.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400
Yeah.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.200
Because that's what you're trying to do with that type of symbol basically, but you're,

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.440
you're being a coward and hiding behind your monitor.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.540
If you feel so strongly about the statement you're trying to make, why don't you go yell

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.640
it in a crowded theater and see what happens to you?

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.300
I just think it's really awful that a failed art student, you know, had to ruin it for

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.000
everybody.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.920
I just think it's ironic that people that are usually the example, supposed to be the

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.920
example of white supremacy aren't really good examples and people you never want to fuck

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.920
anyway, so.

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.920
Yeah.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.840
It's just the most, I wasn't thinking that Greg Probst spit, the white race is a superior

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.840
race.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840
Yeah.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.120
It's, it's like most homophobes I meet are usually like, well, I don't like gay guys

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.120
cause you know, they all want to put it in my butt and it's like, don't flatter.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.120
No.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.120
Flatter yourself.

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120
Exactly.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.200
I, you're like not even on the list.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.560
You're not in the top 20.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.560
You know what?

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.920
You're not even in the top 9 million actually.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:56.280
You're, you're, in fact you, there is no list that you're on whatsoever, so just don't flatter

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.280
yourself.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.280
Exactly.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.640
And you know what, and, and honestly, if, if some, you know, if a guy did happen to

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:08.320
hit on you, I have to say, not interested.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.120
Well usually that, that'll, saying, well I'm not interested.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.840
If you, you know, you know what it is, you know what I think all of, all of hate comes

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:16.960
back to?

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.960
Insecurity.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.560
Don't you think?

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.560
Absolutely.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.480
And so these people who think, oh well I'm gonna be, I'm gonna bring attention to myself

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:30.720
by, you know, by using something that I know is gonna offend people and I'm gonna do all

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.000
the shock value, all it's doing is just making you look like a douche.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Give me attention!

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.600
Well this is, this is the, what I, what I would like, and I'm sorry for getting a little

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.600
ranty on this.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.800
No, it's okay.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.500
I think that, and you know, I have the same opinion towards cussing by the way.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.160
We needed some good controversy tonight, so.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:56.520
I think that by bringing, the, the more people make a big deal out of something, you know

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.520
what I mean?

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.840
I mean, about certain things, the more power they're actually giving to it as opposed to

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.800
what should be happening, and that's taking power out of it.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.120
That's taking the fear out of an object, you know what I mean?

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:16.200
Taking, and I, and I understand that you don't want to ever forget what happened, what brought

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:21.320
these about, but at the same time, you know, you don't want to keep giving people the power

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.260
to hurt you with whatever means they want to.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:33.040
And I think, I, I think it's very good that they're going to, to ban the use on Xbox Live.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.540
That's good.

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:40.040
But I do at the same time think that that's just also giving a little bit more fuel to,

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.920
and you know, I'm trying to see how to phrase this right, because I, I believe they were

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.920
right.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920
I'm 100% behind that.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.000
I think that's good.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Thank you for taking the stand.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.820
I think that's really good.

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:55.020
But at the same time, I think that that's just lighting a little bit more fire to their

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:59.520
butts and starting more controversy by going out and making a big statement about it.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.700
I just think the band should have been quiet.

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.040
You know, does that make sense?

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.040
No, it does.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.960
Ban, ban it, but don't go out and do a press statement saying, oh, we're banning it.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.600
You, here's your cookie.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.600
Haters gonna hate, man.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:13.600
Haters gonna hate.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.600
That's it.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.600
Haters gonna hate.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.600
Haters gonna hate.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.360
So why make a, why make a big deal, why make a big deal out of the haters when you can

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:26.400
just, you know, if they protest it, send them an email, you've been banned for this, this

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400
and this.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400
I will say this.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:34.640
It wasn't quite a press release, just so you know, the guy who is with Xbox runs a personal

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:40.520
blog and he addressed this issue in his personal blog, which the game blogs picked up because

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.440
he happens to have that position.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.000
So just, just to be fair, it is not a press release.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.780
It was his personal blog where I think that's actually kind of neat that he touches on these

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:55.080
touchy subjects in his personal blog where maybe he can't say it in a press release.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.080
That I'm better with.

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.080
That I'm better with.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.080
Yeah.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.040
I mean, but if it had been out like a press release, that's just, you know, it's sort

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:06.080
of like, you know, when a little kid, you tell them they can't do something and they

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.800
want to do it even more because you tell them that they can't do it.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:16.400
Here's a direct quote from the dude's blog and I love this because it's the TLDR, Too

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.400
Long Didn't Read, at the end.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.580
If you see offensive symbols in Call of Duty Black Ops, report them using the in-game option

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.380
and they will be taken care of.

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.240
If you want to argue that swastikas are actually awesome, go to another forum.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.760
On Xbox Live, they are not allowed.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.760
Happy face.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.760
See, that, that's fine.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.800
It's, I mean, and, and thanks for clarifying that for me, but it's just, but, but I want

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.800
to know, I'm not sure that I'm making the right kind of sense when I'm trying to say

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.800
this.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:48.600
Because there's a fine line between doing the right thing, which is, you know, obviously

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.640
he's doing this right thing and bringing undue attention to it.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.280
I agree with that.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.280
I agree.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.560
Because it's just making them think it's all the better to do.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.000
Oh, it's pushing buttons.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.960
Let's do it some more.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.720
I could get into this whole other topic.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:08.160
You know, obviously, you know, you, you have a lot of passion on a lot of these types of

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.120
issues because your recent conversion to Judaism.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.360
I have a lot of passion on the homophobia issues and I could get into this whole thing

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.880
about the whole, like, I don't agree with trying to like drag people out of the closet,

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.880
but that's for another episode when that's the topic.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.840
But there's, you know, there's always different perspectives.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.360
I just think people just need to get over themselves.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.280
Let's play happy music and do a happy segment.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.280
Shall we?

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.280
Let's change the mood.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.280
Let's, let's play happy music.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.840
It's not as good as the techno king song, but it'll deal.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:42.840
All right.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.200
This is, uh, the classic game of the week.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:49.360
This is a segment where we like to take a look back on games of the past and dark soccer

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:54.080
is going to find a classic game that she thinks all you kids ought to be playing right now.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.900
The classic game of the week.

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:56.900
Dark soccer.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:57.900
What is the classic game of the week?

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.240
The classic game of the week is smash TV.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.240
Yes.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:04.640
We're going to blow shit up this classic game of the week.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.640
Awesome.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.640
Skip up a little bit.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:12.520
Smash TV was made in 1990.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.200
It was William's game.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.880
Mark Tramiel was one of the people behind it.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:20.000
He of course gives Mortal Kombat any big surprise there.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.640
It was published by Acclaim for the home systems.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.680
And basically it is based off of the other creator was Eugene Jarvis is based off of

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:35.500
his game robotron 2084, so it's got a dual joystick control and it's sort of taking elements

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:40.680
from the running man, um, you know, where basically you're on a violent video game show

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.680
or video game.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.040
You're on a violent game show.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:49.920
It said in 1999, Ooh, and basically you have to run around and, uh, shoot people who are

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.080
trying to kill you and you get power ups and weapons and bonus prizes.

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:59.560
And uh, it has a game show host who has the best lines ever.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.000
I'd buy that for a dollar.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.960
Big money, big prizes.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.080
I love it.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080
Exactly.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:15.800
And, uh, actually, uh, the I'd buy that for a dollar, um, was, uh, from, uh, a comic in

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.800
Robocop.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.800
Wow.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800
Nice.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:27.120
Um, you have, uh, in fact, one of the enemies is called Mr. Shrapnel who, uh, comes from

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.960
the sides of the walls and, uh, then he explodes.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.960
Um, however, in the NES version, he's a giant rolling bomb.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.800
Um, it's very, very difficult and very, very violent.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:42.120
Um, it's come out on the NES, the SNES as Super Smash TV on the Game Gear, the Genesis

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:46.560
slash Master System slash Mega Drive as Super Smash TV.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:52.400
Um, you actually can use on the NES, you can use the directional pad on the second controller

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.880
to, uh, control where you're shooting.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:58.120
Um, you have to use the multi-tap though to get that done.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:02.200
It also came out, um, it was produced by Ocean for the ZX Spectrum.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:10.640
Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, uh, Atari ST, and Commodore Amiga in 1992, and, uh, I actually

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.640
had no idea it was on the Commodore 64, I thought I had every game.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.040
Oh, Rob failed.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.040
I know.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:21.120
Um, it came out in 1999 as part of the Arcade Party Pack that came out on PlayStation, which

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:25.160
is, I do believe, where the clip that I sent you came from.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:31.760
Um, it was on Midway Arcade Treasures, which is on PC, GameCube, Xbox, PS2, and they will

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.320
save your high scores, ooh.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:40.960
You can get it on Xbox Live Arcade, um, for the Xbox 360, it's 400 Microsoft points, um,

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.840
but, um, I think that they've actually taken the purchase off.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:50.360
Um, but yeah, they had, and, um, the creators had said that they were considering a Smash

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.360
TV 2, so that's pretty interesting.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:22:00.000
But in any way, you know, the game's fun, Dan was actually a, I mentioned it on the

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.280
show before, but his buddy Eric was over here, and Eric had never played Smash TV, so Dan's

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.280
like, edumacation!

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:12.960
DJ Dark Knight in our chatroom asks, wasn't the host the final boss?

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.960
I never got that far.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:16.960
Like I said-

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:22.400
I remember, your husband has, like, the achievements on Xbox Live for, like, the really uber stuff

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.680
that's like, oh my god, how does he do it?

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.680
Yeah.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:26.680
It's a hard game.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:30.840
Dan's really good at, and he used to play it all the time, from what I remember him

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:31.840
saying.

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.000
And you, can I say something else, just speaking of Dan?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Sure.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.600
Tomorrow is his birthday, he's gonna be years old, and-

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.000
21, that's good to know.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
35.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Okay.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.840
And I love my sweetie, so I dedicate this classic game of the week to my boy, to my

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:52.840
Dan Chon.

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:53.840
I'm just kidding.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:54.840
Shut up!

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.840
No, that's cute.

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.840
And he's not even here to hear it, the jerk!

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.560
You'll have to play it back for him.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.560
Hearts.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.960
There you go.

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:03.960
Happy birthday, Dan.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.960
Happy birthday, Dan!

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960
Hippo birdies.

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.960
Hippo birdies?

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960
Hippo birdies to use.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.960
Oh, okay.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:18.080
Alright, that's gonna do it for this part A of Orange Laundry, but we're not done yet.

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.480
Come on back for part B, there's plenty more to come tonight, including the rest of your

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.720
Twitter topics, of which there's quite a few tonight.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:29.400
A lot of rapid news tonight, some mailbag stuff, get in your emails if you haven't got

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:34.960
them in yet, some news about new Castlevania download content, maybe a game if I have time

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960
to write questions.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960
Maybe.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.800
We're running a little bit long tonight, though, so we'll see.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:42.320
I kind of want to take a lot of calls if we can, so we might push the game around.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.320
We'll see.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.720
We will be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so don't go anywhere,

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:55.480
we'll be right back.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.920
Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.920
a voice.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.800
We are taping live on this Sunday evening as we do every week at AllGames.com, 6 o'clock

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.560
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:12.120
It is episode number 391 of our show for November the 28th of 2010.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:20.160
We are joined here tonight with our special guest Marissa, Marissa Congusto with the boosto.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.340
But we do love her and she likes her old school adventure games, you know, she might not be

01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.840
much of a hardcore gamer, but she definitely has an appreciation for what King's Quest

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.840
you were saying.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.640
What's your favorite King's Quest game?

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.640
You know what?

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.640
Say four, say four, say four.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.640
Because that was my favorite.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.640
I'm losing track of the numbers even though I just played them the other day.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.760
The one with the really annoying owl.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.680
I know that sounds like I don't know the game, but I adored that game and you know, ooh,

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.680
Graham.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.680
That sounds like five.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:49.680
I think that's five.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.280
And that's sad that I know that, but I think that might be five.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:57.080
Yes, sorry I'm having a blonde moment mixing up my numbers, but Space Quest I also loved

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.840
and of course Sam and Max.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:24:59.840
There you go, there you go.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:06.040
I'm doing a search for King's Quest annoying owl and it was King's Quest V.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.040
Oh, yes.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.840
Have you previously played King's Quest V?

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.840
No.

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.720
It's a very goddamn game.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.240
So you were just a Sierra fangirl basically.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.240
I really was.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.060
I loved Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.060
And LucasArts.

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.060
There's always room for both.

01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.560
And his desktop adventures, what the fuck.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560
Nice.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.160
All right, hey, and the chat room was backing me up there that King's Quest V, it was definitely

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.160
five.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.120
DDR dollar bill and Salacious Pop backing me up there.

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120
So.

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120
The annoying owl.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.240
Oh, that's right.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.240
Five was on the NES.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.600
I forgot there was an NES version of that.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.360
You're looking at a screenshot from the NES version.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.360
Yeah.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.360
I'm going to post it in the chat room.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.360
Crazy, crazy.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.360
All right.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.760
Anyhow, we are going to get into some rapid fire news, but first, this is usually the

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.600
part where we plug the spinoff shows.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.960
If you like Orange Island Radio, do check out some of our spinoff shows and the other

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.960
content we work on.

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:57.000
I have a whole podcast about World of Warcraft.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.360
I didn't even talk about it tonight, but it was a huge week in World of Warcraft.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.720
We had a jumbo podcast this week.

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:04.400
It's called Horde House.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.400
That's how you found it on Twitter.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.400
Sorry.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.960
Well, yeah, it's on Twitter, but also iTunes.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.400
H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E, the best little Horde House in Azeroth.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.080
Myself and Extra are talking about Warcraft.

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.200
And Dark Saga has a comic book podcast that she hosts with some friends.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.200
A qua-qua?

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.200
A comic book podcast.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.200
Cod-past.

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.200
A com-cast.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:25.200
A comic-ast podcast pod.

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:33.240
It's called Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y, and we record on Sunday in the mornings, and

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.360
we go up on Tuesday.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:42.600
And we're an excellent little podcast involving me and Mara and Marvel, or Tiara, and Dan

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.440
Shadow, and we talk about comics.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.640
Today was mostly talking about Star Trek.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:52.400
One of these days we need to get, like, worlds to collide, and we need to get, like, Tiara,

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.360
Dan, and Extra for all on a show and just see what happens.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.360
World of Warcraft.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.360
It'll be fun.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:00.360
Oh yeah, we'll just revert to World of Warcraft talk, because they play WoW, huh?

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:05.320
Yeah, meanwhile, I'm the one with Taste that plays Star Trek online.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.800
We need to get them on courthouse.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.360
I did make Vice Admiral, by the way.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.360
Congratulations, whatever that means.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.160
I can't rank anymore!

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.760
I leveled a priest to 24 in, like, three days.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.760
Good.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.760
I'm now on my Klingon character, who's not actually Klingon.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.680
Alright, let's get back into some rapid-fire news.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:28.640
Loki's just like, I don't have a spin-off show, I have a baby.

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.260
I don't have time for a spin-off show, nor would I want to- I remember when I tried doing

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:34.600
spin-off shows, it took too much damn time.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.200
Which was the most under-appreciated show we ever did when Orange Lounge Radio was a

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.200
station.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.360
I actually thought your show, and you had what was called LimeWire?

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360
LiveWire?

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.360
What was it called?

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.360
LiveWire.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.360
LiveWire was your mix show.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.360
You actually took-

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.360
LimeWire was that downloading thing.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.360
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.360
Whatever.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.360
I thought maybe- I don't know if it was a play on something.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.360
So-

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.360
He was named after a soda.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.360
Shut up.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.160
You mixed video game music live on air.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:00.320
You actually had turntables, and maybe, like, nine people listened, because it was on a

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.320
Friday night.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.320
Eh, whatever.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.080
It was so under-appreciated, but you did such an awesome job.

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.520
If there's still MP3s of that show floating around, people should try to find them.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.120
This is a great show.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.120
I have all of them.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.120
Alright.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.960
Uh, yeah, so, rapid fire news.

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.940
Um, the VGA is right around the corner, and of course with the video game awards shows

01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:26.200
that are on, um, Spike, they of course show some new trailers for games that haven't been

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.280
announced yet.

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:33.360
And one of those trailers is being teased right now, and of course, no one knows exactly

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.320
what it is, but yeah, we know exactly what it is.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:39.320
Um, apparently the game is going to be a new Resident Evil game.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:45.240
The way we know that is because apparently, a while back, they made a Resident Evil t-shirt

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:50.760
with the exact same silhouettes of the zombies that are featured in the teaser.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.760
Oopsie.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.320
So yes, it's a new Resident Evil game.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.680
Wow, that is recycled artwork, if I've ever seen it before.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.680
I mean, it's hard to convey on the radio, but, uh, you know-

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.680
Yeah, it's like-

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.120
Loki's looking at a side-by-side comparison.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.960
This is also the same zombie just flipped, I mean-

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:11.320
That or someone just flat out stole from someone else, which would also be hilarious if it

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.680
didn't end up being Resident Evil at this point.

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:18.680
But there's another, uh, another image or whatever that says, you know, stay alert,

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:24.000
stay alive, report symptoms, and it has a biohazard logo on it, so, you know, biohazard

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Resident Evil.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Yeah.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
It's not a stretch.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I mean, come on.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.680
Sequel to successful game franchise?

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.680
Whoa.

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:37.120
Uh, so yeah, I expect a new Resident Evil game to be announced.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.640
Um, it's kind of fun.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.960
With the new firmware that came out for, or I should say the new dashboard for the Xbox

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:52.640
360, there was a new, they're calling it the AP 2.5 Protection that was supposed to flag

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:58.500
consoles as being banned, or flag them if you were playing a burnt game or whatever

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.280
on modified drives.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:07.040
Well, apparently, not what, a couple weeks after the firmware or the new dashboard came

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.280
out, they have already found a way around it.

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:12.760
And they've actually come over forever.

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:21.520
The custom firmware group has released new firmwares for iXtreme, LT+, for line on and

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:24.920
BenQ drives for the Xbox 360.

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:30.720
It allows, um, it says defeats current AP 2.5 protection, protects consoles from logging

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:35.840
AP 2.5 violations, full disk stealth, and yada yada yada.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:42.040
Basically it means that they've found a way past their new, uh, I don't know if it's supposed

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.280
to be undefeatable, but, um, new copy protection.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.640
Didn't take very long, so, interesting.

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:54.160
Um, and then finally, and this is kind of neat, we were talking a little bit about,

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:58.280
I should say, Rob was talking about how he likes Super Meat Boy, and I was asking him

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:03.760
about, um, you know, the internets, uh, teh internets.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:10.560
Apparently they get regular patches to that game that allow additional levels to be added.

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:16.720
And they've just gotten 20 new levels, and they're calling it the Sewers of Droz.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:22.080
It's a free pack, features Gish as the only playable character.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:30.240
And, um, it's, um, I guess, a little bit different than the normal, uh, Super Meat Boy stuff.

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:36.640
As well as they're also going to be, um, including, um, some new DLC chapters, made specifically

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:40.440
for, uh, Commander Video and The Kid.

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:45.680
Uh, those are coming early 2011, along with the Best of User Submitted level pack.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:49.960
They'll feature, uh, 20 levels created by PC Mac players.

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:56.640
And also, uh, two non-specific, um, or non-character specific DLC packs will arrive via teh internets

01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:57.640
in December.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:04.280
Uh, Meat Boy, a retro chapter, uh, based on the Best of, uh, Meat Boy Flash prototype,

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:09.760
and iMeat Boy, a pack of, uh, remixed levels from the main game, um, made more difficult.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:13.680
Yes, that's right, they're taking levels from the game and making them even more difficult

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:14.680
than they were.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:18.040
Well, they, they already have the Dark World and the Light World, like, I don't know if

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.040
I talked about this enough.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.040
It's difficult.

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.040
Darker World or what?

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:25.920
Like, yeah, every level in the game, if you get an A+, meaning you, uh, clear it under

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:30.880
the par time, then there's a Dark World version that's just even meaner.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.400
Because some of those level, like, the Light World levels, like, some of them are really

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.400
hard.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:39.000
Like, I almost cried.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.360
Just ask Salacious Pop, he laughed the whole time.

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:45.720
Um, and Rob, I guess, uh, teh internets, I'm trying to see how you would access them.

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:50.680
It says, uh, there's a level called teh internets.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:57.160
It's a world that will and, um, a world that can and will be automatically updated with

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.960
free level packs using the title manage storage system.

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.640
I probably just haven't dug around enough in the game.

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.640
There's a lot in there.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:09.440
Yeah, but they have, like, this cool little, like, um, path or whatever that they have

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.640
a bunch of different levels.

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.800
Yeah, most of the, most of the worlds have that, but I don't, it looks like the background's

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:14.800
a little different.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:18.640
Some of the warp zones and stuff, too, because some of the warp zone retro stuff is, is the

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:19.640
hilarious stuff.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:20.640
Yeah.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.200
Uh, Dark Toa Gak in our chatroom says, I'm sorry, but Super Meat Boy really sounds like

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.200
a porno.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.200
Oh, that's what it is?

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.200
Why?

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:31.240
Um, like, it, it, like, it's the worst title and, like, some of the worst, like, cover

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:33.720
art I've ever seen, but the game is amazing.

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:38.320
You get teh internets, it's actually, you have to obtain 20 bandages.

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:41.000
Oh, I am really terrible, you guys.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.080
I have, like, four bandages.

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.000
So I'll work on that.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
That makes sense.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Alpha Kananagram is echoing that in the chatroom.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.080
All right, I'll work on that.

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.400
I'll work on getting 20 bandages.

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.520
Guys, it is a really hard game, okay?

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:53.160
That's, that's all I'm saying.

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:57.280
All right, if that's all Loki's got, then I'll go to some more, uh, rapid fire news

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280
here.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.280
How about free download content?

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.580
Who likes free stuff?

01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:01.720
You better hurry on this one, though.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.260
It's only free until Tuesday, November 30th.

01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:08.640
Free content for DJ Hero 2 and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:12.040
So if you own either of these games, you might want to go grab this real quick.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:17.480
Uh, there's a DJ Tiesto-themed three-track pack for DJ Hero 2.

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:20.760
And if you're a fan of My Chemical Romance, you can get some of their music on Warriors

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:21.760
of Rock.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.240
Uh, now, here's the deal.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:26.180
You have to get a redemption code for them.

01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:29.200
You go to Coca-Cola's code-generating website.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:36.260
It's at MyCoke.com, and it sounds illegal, uh, slash Guitar Hero, while supplies last.

01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:38.520
But I can't imagine they're out yet.

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:48.040
And if you want just a taste of what the DJ Hero 2 DLC sounds like.

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.600
I think electronic music is ready to go.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.600
I don't want to hear the guy talking.

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.280
I just wanted to hear some music.

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.280
So there you go.

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:57.240
And the, the DJ, uh, Hero one's a little bit harder to find.

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:06.440
I believe it's, um, MyCokeRewards.com slash Rewards slash DJ-Hero dash, um, I have Tiesto

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:07.440
spelled wrong.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.440
Tisto.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.440
DJ Tisto.

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.440
Tisto.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.040
Um, dash mix dash pack.

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.960
Um, and that should pick it up.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:20.360
Otherwise I know there, the, there was a story on the internet.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.360
You'll find it.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.400
There was a story on Joystick or whatever that had a link, someone made a link to it

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.840
because I could not find it.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:31.360
I got the actual, you know, the newsletter or nothing new, the PR Newswire or whatever.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.440
I'm like, okay, where, where the hell's the link to download this?

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:37.120
And I went on My Coke Rewards and there's nothing on there.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.600
I'm like, well, fuck.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:43.680
Uh, Tigerclaw wanted to know what songs for Tiesto, uh, Traffic mixed with Louder Than

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.680
Boom.

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:47.600
Uh, the Feel It In My Bones song he did with Tegan and Sarah, which I actually really liked

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.600
that song.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.600
It's a cool song.

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.020
And Knock You Out featuring Emily Haynes mixed with Young Lions.

01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:53.440
Those are the songs in there.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:58.160
Uh, and for Dark Sakura, who I know likes My Chemical Romance, the free songs are Bulletproof

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.880
Heart, Helena, Teenagers, and Welcome to the Black Parade.

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:05.820
And they will become paid DLC once, uh, that expires.

01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:09.560
So even if you don't own the game, just download the, get the code and then that way you have

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.160
it for when you do buy the game.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:16.600
That actually, those are actually songs that I would really like, cause I mean, I've got,

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:22.040
um, the ones that they did for Rock Band and I wanted more like Helena is such a great

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.040
song.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.000
It'd be really fun to have.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.240
Now going onto another news story, this, I, I am so confused by this next story.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.240
This is just so crazy.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.240
All right.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.420
Game Room, right?

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:37.120
It was kind of neat when it first came out and then like the games that have been released

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.840
for it had been kind of blue.

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.960
And then, you know, Chrome has been having problems and so we've all just kind of written

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.960
off Game Room.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:44.960
Right?

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.040
Well, did you hear what games came out on Game Room this week?

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:55.160
If you missed it, uh, Game Pack 12 has the arcade version of Blades of Steel, Trick Trap

01:36:55.160 --> 01:37:01.680
1771, Pitfall 2 on the Atari 2600, which by the way is my favorite 2600 game ever made.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.480
Uh, and the Intellivision's Vectron.

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:09.520
Now some of the Game Room, uh, people that can, you can go in on the PC version and kind

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:12.400
of see like what games are going to be coming out soon.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.400
Get this.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.600
You know what else is in the pack?

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:22.880
Amidaar, Food Fight, Puyen, Sunset Riders from Konami and Dark Sakura, Twinbee is in

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:25.400
this pack, right?

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.820
So I'm sitting here going, you're putting this out now?

01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:32.900
You waited until now to give us this stuff?

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:36.920
Like when everybody was declaring, ah, Game Rooms, oh, Game Rooms.

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:40.280
You waited until now to whip out Sunset Riders.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.280
Twinbee!

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.320
And, yeah, Twinbee, whatever.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.320
Twinbee!

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:50.160
Like, I don't even understand the idea behind that or what, that's, oh my gosh.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:56.880
And Blades of Steel, like the best hockey game ever made, arcade version nonetheless,

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:01.440
which I bet a lot of people haven't even played because we all just remember the NES version.

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.200
Yeah, so if you haven't been on Game Room in a while, now you have reason to go check

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:07.200
it out again.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.040
Like, seriously, surely one of those games made you go, oh, what, what, what?

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.800
And yeah, the pricing is still the same.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.600
It's what, three dollars on one platform, five on both?

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.160
Crazy.

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.640
One more story for you guys about Dance Central download content and some of the stuff that's

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:27.640
available there, and I'm sure, ah, Loki's downloaded them all already and he's getting

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:34.440
into this, ah, Cameo with Word Up, Word Up, and then, ah, Tag Team with Whoop, there it

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:35.440
is.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.440
I know Loki's dancing to that one.

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:40.800
Whoop, I hope he gets to raise the roof in that song.

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.720
You need to play Dance Central, Marissa.

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:44.280
How long are you in town, Marissa?

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.440
Ah, I have to leave on Tuesday morning.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.440
Ah, shit.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:51.400
If I didn't have this whole work thing tomorrow, I'd be like, I'm bringing Dance Central over,

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.400
we're playing Whoop, there it is.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.120
Come down for Tron, you can crash on my floor.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:59.800
Wish I could make it work, we'll see, we'll see.

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.320
You can sleep in the Chris's gamer chair.

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.320
And then, ah, Black Eyed Peas, the one that makes the creepy noises.

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:10.800
Yeah, it makes creepy noises at night when the temperature changes all of a sudden.

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.000
It's Haunted Chair.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.320
If you actually like the Black Eyed Peas, I've Got a Feeling is coming out, which, what

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.360
David Guetta did kind of helped with that track, and he's cool, so I'll give it that.

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:23.400
There you go, that's your Dance Central DLC.

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.400
Dark Sakura?

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:27.880
Well, we have some other stuff.

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:37.080
For the consoles, there is, on Capcom's official Japanese language blog, there are screens

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.640
of Yun and Yang in their arranged costumes.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:45.880
So instead of their little kind of streety looking fun outfits, they are dressed as a

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.280
chef and a waiter.

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:52.440
And yeah, chef and a waiter.

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440
So that should be cool.

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.760
Apparently there's going to be achievements open for both of the characters as well.

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:06.080
And rumors of an evil Ryu, a grain of salt territory, and some other stuff.

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:14.720
Also for those waiting for Otomedias X-cellent, it's not going to be out until, looks like

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:19.720
Spring 2011, not Fall 2010 like they originally said.

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:23.680
So they say it's a delay in production.

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:24.680
So let's...

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:26.920
More games getting delayed.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:27.920
Same story every week.

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:28.920
I hope it's for a good reason.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.280
I hope it's for a good reason.

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:39.000
And finally, Doctor Who, Mazes of Time, will be out for the iPhone and iPad, actually for

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.840
the holiday season.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.120
I hope that's going to be in the US as well.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:54.000
But basically, it's being put out by Tag that's done other apps for different Channel 4 shows

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.720
in the UK, Come Dine with Me and Peep Show.

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.720
So maybe that'll be cool.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.720
Alright.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:06.020
Are we ready to get to some Twitter topics and get to the tweets that people have been

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:07.020
tweeting us all night.

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.020
Are we ready?

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.020
Yes, let's.

01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:12.120
We already know that it's a great Twitter tonight because of the whole jetpack cat thing

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.120
that's been going on.

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.120
So I'm very excited about that.

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.760
Yes, we did start a new hashtag.

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:17.760
We're hoping you'll catch on.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:18.760
Alright, anyhow.

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.360
For now, going to the Twitter and some of the other tweets we got this week at twitter.com

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:24.360
slash OLR.

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:31.040
We'll start it off with Fun ET Man wants to know, any of you at OLR play Donkey Kong Country

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.200
Returns or Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom?

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:36.760
I don't even know if I've heard of that second game.

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:38.520
Donkey Kong Country Returns, not yet.

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:44.280
The second one's kind of a little bit like that last Guardian game, you have like this

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:50.520
kind of golem character that you're having help you around like a giant monster thing.

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:54.320
Oh, now that I'm looking at it, this looks kind of cool actually.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.280
Donkey Kong Country Returns looks pretty cool.

01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:02.720
Sorry, I'm looking at a little, wow, that's really stylistic.

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.880
Is that on an arcade or is that like an actual retail game?

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.040
That's a retail game.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.540
That looks kind of awesome actually.

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.640
The problem is these games are $60, you know what I mean?

01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:13.640
That game is $40.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640
Really?

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640
Yes.

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640
This actually looks kind of awesome.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:21.760
And if you shopped on Amazon, you could have gotten in for $30.

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.760
Really?

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.320
That looks kind of neat.

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:27.960
Sorry, I know it's like radio and me looking at a trailer is not that exciting, but check

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:28.960
that out.

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:34.400
Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom, M-A-J-I-N and the Forsaken Kingdom.

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:36.820
Donkey Kong Returns, I'm kind of like, eh.

01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:40.880
My Wii is still in a box and this game does not really motivate me to get it out of the

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:41.880
box.

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:42.880
You put your Wii in a box?

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:43.880
Wii in a box.

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.880
My Wii in a box.

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:45.880
Step shift.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:49.680
All right, Spaznator PSN says, if I can get through tonight on the phone, I'll call in

01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:52.160
giving a mini review of Voodoo on the PS3.

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.160
What's Voodoo?

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:54.160
V-U-D-U?

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.200
It's a movie streaming service.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.640
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.640
Oh, okay.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.160
So it's like a Netflix competitor type thing?

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:04.760
Uh, something like that I guess.

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:08.240
Now here's why I like having a live chat room, because when we're sitting here going, I don't

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:11.300
know the game, I've never played the game, our chatters help fill in the gaps here.

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:14.920
So, uh, Miklotov in our chat room says, Donkey Kong Returns is hard as hell.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:19.120
And SolarFlare says, Donkey Kong Returns is only fun with a group of friends and booze.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:22.280
There you go.

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:27.640
Deathwishing says, Rob should dust off his PS3 because Konami's space on home has DDR

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:28.640
in it.

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:29.640
I didn't know.

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.840
So they brought DDR to PlayStation Home now I guess?

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.840
I'll look at it.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.520
I haven't played the PS3 in a while, but I'll take a look.

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:39.480
It's not that I hate the PS3, it's just there haven't been a lot of games on it I've been

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:40.480
wanting to check out.

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:43.680
Uh, and is 3D Dot Game Heroes worth a buy?

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:44.680
Yes.

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.000
If you like the Zelda games, yes.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.760
Although this game is a lot harder than the Zelda games.

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.920
If you're a video game nerd, which you probably are if you're listening to this show, um,

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:57.160
there's lots of video game nerd references all over the game, uh, and it's very, very

01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:58.160
Zelda-like.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.160
And you can probably find that stuff on sale.

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:03.340
I mean, it was only $30 originally when it came out, right?

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:06.840
So now you can probably find it for like $15 or $20 and it's absolutely worth it at that

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:07.840
price.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.200
The only drawback, it's not a very long game once you know what you're doing.

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:12.480
You'll probably beat it in like six hours.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.320
So, something to consider.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.320
I would say if you can find it on sale, absolutely.

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.320
Don't pass it up.

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:22.640
Um, moving on to some other tweets.

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.640
Some people are venting that they weren't able to listen to OLR.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:27.640
Sorry.

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:33.600
Uh, DJ Rama S says, IGN's top 10 worst games of 2010.

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.040
I had a problem with three of the titles.

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.680
I'm not even going to look at this and I'm going to tell you, they're probably trying

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.780
to just create controversy to get page hits, period.

01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:47.400
They want people to dig this and what have you and just get more page hits.

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:52.920
It's probably not really accurate, but I'm going to look now and see what, what, what

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:53.920
they came up with.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:58.600
And again, this is a link from DJ Rama S on Twitter, it's IGN's top 10 worst games of

01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.600
2010.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.120
And he says he has a problem with three of these titles.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:07.520
Number 10, Sonic the four, Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the four, Sonic the Hedgehog four episode

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:08.520
one.

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:10.680
I can see where that's landing on people's lists.

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:13.760
It was a bit of a disappointment for a lot of people.

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.760
Number nine, the PlayStation move.

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.880
See, that's not even really a game.

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.080
I think that's just there to, it's just controversy.

01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.280
Number eight, Lost Planet two.

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:26.580
Number seven, Kane and Lynch two, Dog Days.

01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.120
Number six, Crackdown two.

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:31.200
Would you say that was one of the 10 worst games of the year, Loki?

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.120
It's not the worst game, but it was definitely a disappointment compared to the last one.

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.840
But it's not, I wouldn't say that's the worst game.

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.800
That's not even a bad game, really.

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.920
Number five, Microsoft Connect.

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.200
Oh, fuck off.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.400
It's too early to tell if Connect is...

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.280
They gave it a good review even.

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.920
I, no, that's just, it's for page hits.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:55.480
This is why you do not read corporate media websites.

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.720
I mean, this is a, ugh.

01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:01.840
Anyhow, four, Fable three.

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:03.880
I've been hearing raves about Fable three.

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.760
They gave it good reviews also.

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:09.640
Number three, Medal of Honor.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:13.720
Number two, Gran Turismo five.

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.360
And number one, Final Fantasy 13.

01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:17.520
Fuck off.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.520
Fuck off.

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.960
You put 13 on the list and not 14.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.640
No, why did they put, okay, they put Gran Turismo...

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:26.120
Your opinion is invalid, person that wrote this article.

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:27.120
Fuck off.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.520
Now, is that even an article, or is that like a blog post on it?

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:30.520
I don't even know.

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.520
I stopped caring.

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.520
It's a piece of poop.

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:34.520
It's probably, it's just a joke.

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:35.520
Who gives a crap?

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:36.520
I don't know.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.520
It says slash articles.

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.200
Must it be with their eight, like, podcasts that they have?

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:42.680
Doesn't say blog, no, it says editor.

01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.120
There's some dude that has the editor badge or whatever.

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:46.120
Great.

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.120
Yeah.

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.120
That's awesome.

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.120
Yeah.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.280
I'm reading some comments in our chat room.

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.280
IGN equals fail.

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:54.640
IGN equals we need more hits.

01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:57.720
I bet FFX2 is worse than Final Fantasy 13.

01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.920
That's what you get for reading IGN.

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:00.920
There you go.

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:01.920
Enough said.

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:03.360
All right.

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:04.960
Tiger Claw sends us some links.

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:05.960
He sent us a few.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.320
I don't know which ones to read.

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.760
Oh, I like this one, and this didn't make our show roll tonight, and I remember reading

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:11.760
this.

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:17.060
Tiger Claw says this is a link, actor Billy Bob Thornton, speaking of people that need

01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:25.680
to fuck off, blames video games for the death of quality in Hollywood.

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:30.320
Here's some lovely quotes from Billy Bob Thornton, because when I want an expert on video games,

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:33.120
I think, I wonder what Billy Bob Thornton thinks.

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:36.560
I even actually have a sticker that says WWBBTD.

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:43.640
I just like the word lovely and Billy Bob Thornton going together.

01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:49.200
It says the man who used to wear a vial of blood around his neck.

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:52.920
Why are game blogs even reporting what this asshole has to say?

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.680
Why is he fucking relevant?

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.960
Why are we not talking more about Jetpack Cat?

01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:58.960
Why are we not more talking about her boobs?

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:03.280
They're right here in the studio, and yet I'm talking about some dickhead Billy Bob

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.120
Thornton story.

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.560
It's where every gamer has a voice.

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.560
That's the stuff they tweeted.

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.280
Next in all games radio, Marissa's tits.

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.560
What we need is Jetpack Cat to bounce off your boobies.

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:23.080
The boyfriend every morning comes up to me, he does the cat paw thing on the cleavage,

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:29.000
you know, like when they're adjusting to get into bed.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.880
Anyway if you care with this asshole, thanks.

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:36.060
They're geared towards the video game playing generation, and these video games, which I'm

01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:40.740
on my sum about constantly, these games are people killing for fun, and I think traditionally

01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:44.560
in movies there's always been some kind of lesson in the violent movies.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:49.980
By the way, his next picture is called Faster, and it stars Dwayne the Rock Johnson as an

01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:54.520
ex-convict on a quest for revenge against the people who set him up in which the actor

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.480
plays a flawed cop.

01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:00.360
Oh, and by the way, he goes on a killing spree.

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:04.960
Not the cop, but, you know.

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:05.960
Fuck off.

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:06.960
Alright.

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:16.640
Let's see, what else, do we have any other, Maginomicon, I'm sorry if I'm saying this

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:24.480
incorrectly, Maginomyicon, Maginomicon, sends us this tweet here.

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:28.160
I don't know, the title is kind of catching me here, it's called penalizing users of big

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.560
breasts.

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:36.620
I think I'll also penalize players for making female characters with large breasts by applying

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:38.040
common sense to that too.

01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:41.280
Oh, this must be from like a role playing blog.

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.200
So like if you're going to make a female character with big boobies, just so that she can have

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:51.720
big boobies, this DM wants to have decreased maximum stamina, stamina drains faster, and

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:54.800
you can't wear some sizes of torso armor.

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:58.840
Have you ever found, Marissa, that there's certain torso armor you're unable to wear?

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:00.800
Because I somehow doubt that.

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.320
I have torso armor.

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:03.640
Actually, Rob.

01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:04.640
What?

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:12.880
I played D&D once, and our, if we were to, we would actually have to roll for fitting

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.680
sometimes for certain armors, depending on different stats.

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.560
I'm serious.

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:22.520
He would actually say if you're going to be extra, especially for the guys who would play

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:28.160
female characters and would make them that busty, yes I have many a D&D game where guys

01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.160
have played women.

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:30.160
Alright.

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:36.000
Yeah, they were too busty, yeah, they'd actually roll sizes for armor, and then make them get

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.160
a different class.

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:42.600
It was actually, he was very nitpicky, but I've been at real tabletop games where they've

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.600
done that.

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:50.340
You know, way back when I was in high school, I used to play D&D, and everybody was a guy

01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:54.160
in the group, so of course I had to play the girl, because it's funny to have, you gotta

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:57.400
have a chick there, but then all the guys are like, well what if we want to hit on you,

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:00.280
and I'm like, well my character's a lesbian, so don't even bother.

01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:06.080
So I played the one lesbian, and she was, I decided to play the very stereotypical man-hating

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:10.400
lesbian because it was high school, you know, we're all stupid ass kids, so it was fun.

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.400
It was a lot of fun.

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:14.960
I always threatened to kick their ass, and it was good, good times.

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:21.040
I mean, I have boob armor, and the Ute's brassiere's Nazi bras, so, I think I've told my stories

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.040
before.

01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:23.040
I still love that.

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:26.720
I made her do that for Dan, because Dan hadn't heard it.

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:31.360
By the way, the name is pronounced, and he's in chat, so sorry about that, Majinomicon,

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.360
Majinomicon.

01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:36.040
Oh, light Necronomicon, but Majinomicon.

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.040
Yes.

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:43.080
Let's see, we've got, other stories from Tigerclaw, I want to read at least one other one of these

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.080
here.

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.960
How about the Kinect being hacked into a Super Mario Brothers emulator controller?

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.480
Yes, somebody has hacked their Kinect.

01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:53.600
There's this whole little video here of some dude on YouTube, playing, oh it's that same

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.980
guy I saw in a video last week.

01:51:55.980 --> 01:52:01.720
He hacked his Kinect, and he's actually running to the right and left, and jumping to jump.

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.920
That's actually kind of cool.

01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:09.280
When he jumps, Mario jumps, and when he goes to the right side, the character moves right.

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:11.920
When he goes to the left side, the character moves left.

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.620
Okay, neat.

01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:19.040
They're starting to get a little craftier with these Kinect add-ons, so, you go, guy.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:25.680
His name on YouTube, if you want to look at the video yourself, Yankeyan, Y-A-N-K-E-Y-A-N.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:27.440
Check that out.

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:34.480
You can see him kind of like doing the Mario Brothers dance, it's a lot of fun there.

01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:40.720
One more tweet from Dark Kiskay sends us, is AC Brotherhood amazing but pretty buggy?

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:44.200
I don't see a link with that, but has anyone played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood?

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.640
I've heard really good things about it.

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:49.800
A lot of my guildies in WoW are like, can't play WoW right now, I'm playing Assassin's

01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:51.640
Creed, sorry.

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:54.160
So I sadly have not played the game myself.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:57.560
Gee, another console game being bugged on release?

01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.260
What a surprise.

01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:00.260
What a big surprise.

01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:05.600
That's going to do it for Twitters this week, Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:07.480
us some tweets for next week.

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:11.720
Meanwhile, back into some gaming news, Loki.

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:14.640
So yeah, there's some other interesting stuff.

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:21.020
This is kind of neat because the game came out so long ago, but apparently now, Axl Rose

01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:27.040
is suing Activision over the inclusion of Slash in Guitar Hero 3.

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:33.720
Apparently they're saying that they filed a $20 million lawsuit against the publisher

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:39.840
for associating Guns N' Roses music, specifically Welcome to the Jungle with the former Guns

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:47.280
N' Roses guitarist Slash and his new band Velvet Revolver in 2007's Guitar Hero 3 Legends

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.280
of Rock.

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:52.560
It says, Activision had permission to use Welcome to the Jungle, but according to court

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:59.560
documents obtained by Radar Online, broke its contract with Rose by including imagery

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:05.280
of Slash in the game and offering music by Velvet Revolver as downloadable content.

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:11.460
It says the juxtaposition exploits the prior association between Slash and Guns N' Roses

01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:14.400
and promotes Slash and Velvet Revolver.

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:21.760
Their separate interest includes VR tracks as available downloads, all of which was and

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:27.120
is indirectly contrary to the contractual obligations of the defendants.

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:29.800
That was a query in the filing.

01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.440
And let's see.

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.580
How were sales of Chinese Democracy, just out of curiosity?

01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:39.680
That album that took what, like 10 years to make?

01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:40.680
I have no idea.

01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:41.680
That's not commented on.

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:43.000
Is he being a bitter Betty?

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.400
Because I think Axl Rose is being a bitter Betty.

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:53.880
It says, you know apparently there's a comment, Activision's EVP of Music Affairs, Tim Riley

01:54:53.880 --> 01:55:00.180
is quoted as saying, come on Beta, you can't believe everything you read on the internet

01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:08.600
in response to rumors of Slash's inclusion heard by Roses rep Beta Labace, I guess.

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:14.480
Whether Rose's claims of treachery on Activision's part turned out to be true or not, that remains

01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.480
to be determined.

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:19.800
Oh, we actually have another comment that's coming in right now over email from Activision,

01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:23.920
official comment on this whole piece, quote, fuck you, Rose.

01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:24.920
What do you know?

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:25.920
There it is.

01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:27.700
It's more of Axl Rose being an ass.

01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:30.000
It's Axl Rose being Axl Rose, actually.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:36.400
Well, it sounds like here that I, well, I don't know, they said that.

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:40.240
It's just weird, like a lot of these lawsuits, I guess, take a really long time, maybe, I

01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:44.320
mean, because they're on what, Guitar Hero, it'd be the equivalent of Guitar Hero like

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:45.320
6?

01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:46.320
Yeah, this is about Guitar Hero 3.

01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:47.320
Yeah.

01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:50.560
Well, I mean, if Slash actually has songwriting credit on that song, I don't know how legitimate

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:55.240
that claim could really be because, you know, he's allowed to be represented as a musician

01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:57.480
unless they want, you know, make it not exist.

01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:05.200
Here's the thing, is it's not really saying, you know, it's just, it's just because Slash

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.680
is in the game, I understand that people would associate Slash maybe with Guns N' Roses,

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:13.480
but you know, he's kind of moved on now.

01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:18.240
I mean, just because there's a Guns N' Roses song in there, and Slash is in there, doesn't

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:25.520
necessarily mean, you know, that, I don't know, I think if Slash is independent at this

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:28.720
point, I don't necessarily associate Slash strictly with Guns N' Roses.

01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:33.720
I associate Slash with like that kind of like fro-y, hairy thing he has.

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:37.400
It's not even really like a fro though, it's like a, you know, he just has beautiful hair,

01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:40.600
you just want to run your fingers through it even though you know it's a wig.

01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.560
What exactly is wrong with associating all that stuff anyways?

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:48.040
I mean, what kind of damages were actually caused to Guns N' Roses?

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:53.080
I mean, because I think Guitar Hero 3, you know, arguably was probably a pretty good

01:56:53.080 --> 01:57:00.240
game, I mean, at the time, and, um, you know, I don't think it's really negative for them.

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:03.720
I mean, didn't they have Chinese Democracy as, you know, download content?

01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:04.720
I love this.

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:09.080
As J100Matt says, well, you know what they say, every rose has its thorn up its ass.

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:12.760
Uh, Jiove Dea, Jiove Dea, I love this.

01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:15.080
Also, it's a guitar game.

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:18.680
Who is the guitar player in the band?

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:22.000
I mean, that's just what Activision should take to court right there.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.680
Jiove Dea should be a lawyer.

01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:26.240
There you go.

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:28.040
Ah, whatever.

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.960
Whatever, dude.

01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:34.680
I also love the comment here from Death Wishing, it was a while ago, but at chat.orangehonestrody.com,

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:37.240
Axl Rose needs money for cocaine and blow.

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:39.680
Yeah, that's what it's come to.

01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:44.240
Well, let's move on to something happy, bouncy, fun, and talk about Virtual Console.

01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:48.160
I thought for a second there we were going to talk about Jetpack Cat.

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:52.040
No, we kind of talked as much as we can about Jetpack Cat tonight, but we'll talk about

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:57.120
some possible Virtual Console releases coming from Taito, because of some recent trademark

01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.720
applications, suggesting that some Super Nintendo games are going to make a comeback, including

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:09.640
Darius Twin, Lufia and the Fortress of Doom, and Lufia 2, Rise of the Sinistrols.

01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:13.760
Those were all very recent trademarks that were applied for.

01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:16.720
That means that these games could be coming out on Virtual Console very soon, usually

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:20.120
that is what this ends up meaning.

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:24.360
Just so you know, Darius Twin was actually released on the Japan version earlier this

01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.360
year.

01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:29.680
Lufia, I don't think, has been released just yet, but it looks like it might be.

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:33.400
Well hooray for Virtual Console actually getting some new content, that's got to be exciting

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:34.400
for them, right?

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:35.400
Good games too.

01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:36.400
Uh huh.

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.400
So there you go.

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:45.600
Uh, no, not Darius Twin, not Marisa, that's not Darius Twin, just so you know.

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:47.840
Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have?

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:56.640
Well there is some new download content for Castlevania, Harmony of Despair, for 240 points.

01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:04.480
You can use Julius Belmont and Yoko Belnades, who I guess was from one of the older ones

01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:08.480
from Castlevania 3, Saifo was it?

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:16.720
Anyway, Julius has the extra long whip that can work as a grappling hook, and Yoko has

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:23.360
magic, which definitely goes back to the old games, so that's pretty cool.

01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:28.400
So let's just hope that it improves the game some.

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:30.400
Alright.

01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:32.520
Yes.

01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:39.720
This is kind of interesting and totally something I could see on Top Gear, but there was an

01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:45.160
article, can a video game make you into an elite race driver?

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:48.080
And apparently the answer is no.

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:50.560
Actually you're wrong, the answer is yes.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:56.640
Apparently there is an extremely realistic racing simulator called iRacing, no it's not

01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:06.240
for the iPod or iPad, apparently the top driver won $10,000 despite never driving over 100

02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:08.020
miles an hour in real life.

02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:12.640
Top Gear, they put them into an actual race car to see if the digital skills translate

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:19.760
into a real racing prowess, and apparently he did pretty well.

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:24.480
He clocked in a lap time three seconds off of what an experienced driver would be expected

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:25.480
to deliver.

02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:32.640
Of course they say three seconds is an eternity in motorsports, but considering this is his

02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:35.460
very first time, it's pretty awesome.

02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:41.280
His braking points were spot on, and he seemed firm and precise on the throttle, and in the

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:46.440
fastest corner he's entering 100 miles an hour compared to an experienced driver's 110

02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:54.160
miles an hour, a sign of absolute confidence and natural feel for grip as Top Gear wrote.

02:00:54.160 --> 02:01:02.080
And so apparently I guess training on a really, I mean it kind of makes sense, if you're training

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:09.600
on a game that's an extreme simulation of the real thing, it's almost like doing the

02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:12.040
real thing, since it's a simulation of that.

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:14.040
But can you change a tire?

02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:19.520
That's not a driver's job, okay, that's what your pit crew is for.

02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:22.660
It just takes down sexiness points, that's all I'm saying.

02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:26.280
My only worry is that, you see, I look at this and go, well hold on though, just because

02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:30.440
I play Microsoft Flight Simulator, or whatever they're calling it now, Microsoft Flight,

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.440
doesn't mean I can fly a plane.

02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:33.640
But we should see if you can.

02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:34.640
No we shouldn't.

02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:37.120
No, they have simulators for that.

02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:40.600
I just, but see, my thought is that, and it was hilarious, it's supposed to work the

02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:41.600
other way around.

02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.160
If I know how to fly a plane, then Microsoft Flight Simulator is supposed to be a way for

02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:50.360
me to kind of like, I don't know, I guess practice without practicing, or sort of like

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.680
relive that experience from the comfort of my own home.

02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:57.120
You're saying that if I'm good at an arcade game, I can't go fight off an alien race?

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:00.120
You know I believe that is what I'm saying, yes, actually.

02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:04.600
That's not, I don't want to live in that world.

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:05.600
I think you do, I'm sorry.

02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:09.160
I think the problem though would be, I mean, although that actually does sound pretty awesome

02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:14.640
is the, you're still lacking the intuitiveness that you get, you know, if you're a good car

02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:19.800
driver and you know all its hiccups and you could sense gravity movement within the car

02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:23.680
itself and when it needs, you know, something, I mean I know this isn't a regular driving

02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:27.920
simulation but still, you know, drivers get an intuition about their own car and all the

02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:28.920
moving parts and everything.

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:32.440
Of course with the simulators that I play, I'd need an Uzi and I'd be firing at the back

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:35.960
of their car and destroying their tires, so.

02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:40.040
Does the simulator simulate like the G-forces and all that stuff too though?

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:41.040
No, see.

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:44.880
Isn't that a big part of racing, you know, being able to physically handle it?

02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:50.160
Well that's the thing, it says even though, you know, he may have the skills to do it,

02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:55.920
he's not in physical, perfect physical shape for being a racer but they're saying that

02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:56.920
you're young enough.

02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:59.520
So what they're saying is by playing the computer games you're still fat.

02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:06.000
No, it's not that at all, it's just saying that, you know, you're just not, you haven't

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:11.840
experienced those G-forces and stuff and the physical toll of driving that fast, you know,

02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:16.300
you have to compensate for that and if you can't do that with a simulator, then you're

02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:18.120
not really ready for the real thing.

02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.440
For the record though, I mean most 16 year olds drive like they learned on Grand Theft

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.440
Auto anyway, so.

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.440
True.

02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:29.400
There's some real dipshit drivers out there on the road and I'm always like, how did you

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:30.400
get a license?

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:31.400
Jesus.

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:37.560
Alright, anyhow, how about a story about Tron, yes Tron, we heart Tron, which by the way,

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:44.700
the Tron soundtrack is out around the internets and sexy.

02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:50.200
Don't download it expecting a Daft Punk album though, it's, oh my gosh, things are crashing,

02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:53.520
it's a movie score and a damn good one I gotta say.

02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:57.240
Anyhow, Tron the video game, Tron Evolution, supposedly does have some of the Daft Punk

02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:59.320
songs in it, as we talked about last week.

02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:03.280
Also Tron Evolution is going to have day one downloadable content.

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:08.260
So the PC, the PS3 and the 360 versions of the game, they will actually include codes

02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:13.200
that will allow you to unlock some additional multiplayer maps and a character skin that

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:15.240
is basically Sam Flynn.

02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:20.160
So I guess think of that as your whole encouragement to not buy the game used, some additional

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:25.760
maps and the code and all that, yes, but that's some of the downloadable day one DLC.

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.880
So at least they're not charging you to play the game online if it's a used copy, but yeah,

02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:33.200
only with the new copy are you going to get some of this extra stuff.

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:38.840
And that's usually the way publishers do it, they don't pull this dick-ass move like EA

02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:46.360
or THQ, EA at least will give you a trial, and it's only really with their sports games,

02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:51.800
so if you want to play online, most of the sports games you're probably buying new anyways,

02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:59.160
but like THQ with their martial arts games and stuff, it's just a dick move, I'm sorry.

02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:03.560
Sorry, no trial whatsoever, you have to pay money up front if you don't buy this game

02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:04.560
new.

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:10.000
Alright, well we're going to open up the mailbag at mailbag at orangelauntrader.com and dive

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:15.120
into the email bag, and Dark Soccer is going to go in and pull out some emails and read

02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:16.800
them for us.

02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:18.280
Just two.

02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:19.440
Just two?

02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:22.480
And it says, non-credible rumor.

02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:27.880
Just a silly rumor I may or may not have heard, Treyarch may be doing a side project to bring

02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:32.520
casual gamers to Star Trek Online, allowing players to establish a Klingon salon.

02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:37.760
The first salon to be set up, Modern Warfare.

02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:40.080
I'm going to guess this is just a joke, Dark Soccer.

02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:42.440
Yes it is, that's what I said, incredible.

02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:49.180
And a congratulations to our winner of our Castlevania Symphony of the Night code.

02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:52.560
It goes to Mike, and enjoy it.

02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:56.560
You are quite welcome, he says, oh my gosh, thank you so much, I love you guys, heart

02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:57.560
smile.

02:05:57.560 --> 02:05:59.880
There's probably like a hundred guys named Mike that listen to this show.

02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:01.680
Well this, Mike who won.

02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:03.600
Okay, Mike who won.

02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:04.600
Mike who won.

02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:08.160
That's now your last name, Mike who won.

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.160
The winner is you.

02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:10.160
That's it?

02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:11.160
That's it.

02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:13.160
We've had some kind of like, not very full mailbag recently.

02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:14.160
Turkey comma.

02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:15.160
I guess.

02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:16.160
Turkey comma.

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:18.120
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com if you want to send us an email.

02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:21.480
You really need to fill her up for next week, like I want part B to be nothing but Dark

02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:22.480
Soccer reading emails.

02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:23.480
I'll be fine.

02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:24.480
Do or die.

02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:25.480
Alright.

02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:29.480
Well, let's do the FUs of the week then.

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:47.320
All this is bad, here is justice, here is punishment, here is, this is fucked up.

02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:51.460
Nephew to money and my lack thereof.

02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:56.560
I want my severance check, do you hear me you bastards?

02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:59.080
But they might if you bang a little louder.

02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:03.280
But I am glad to be free of that horrid horrid place.

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:04.280
Okay.

02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:14.900
I have to say it nephew to the fact that this week is actually a regular week and not a

02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:22.120
short week like last week was, I don't know, I get spoiled by the short weeks, it's awesome.

02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:27.000
But uh, yeah, nephew that, nephew the round table for forgetting to put my order in when

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I ordered it.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.960
That's why I call ahead, you know, because if I wanted it not ready I would just go in

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:37.880
and order it, but you know, that's technicality I guess.

02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:40.840
I don't really have a lot to be angsty about right now, things are pretty good all things

02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:45.040
considered I'll just say F you to the fact that I had a nice long weekend and it's over.

02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:48.160
Oh F you to the fact that I stayed up till four in the morning last night, that really

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:51.800
wasn't smart because like I have to get up at four in the morning on Thursday to catch

02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:55.920
a flight to Burbank, so that really wasn't smart of me.

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:56.920
Just saying.

02:07:56.920 --> 02:08:00.080
Marissa, do you have any FUs you want to throw out there?

02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:01.080
Maybe you have some angst?

02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:04.480
It's my shock, anyone who knows me, but I'm not mad about anything right now.

02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:09.040
I guess F you to not being able to stay out here long enough, but I'm having a great time

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:10.040
so thank you.

02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:13.880
Well you're on vacation so you know it's hard to give an F you, it's like you know if like

02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:18.360
if I'm in Hawaii and I'm full of FUs if it's not about like some bitch stewardess or bad

02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:20.880
hotel service like I'm really like kind of a dick.

02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.480
Oh you know what I do have an F you, I have an F you to the fact that I always have to

02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:28.720
fly on screaming baby airlines.

02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:29.720
Thank you for flying.

02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.720
Come fly with us.

02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:31.720
Exactly.

02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:36.040
Whatever happens on good old fashioned days you just give your kid a bunch of Benadryl

02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:38.520
before they get on the plane so they sleep through the whole flight.

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:42.280
Well if you're flying, you're flying the same path I do a lot, that's Burbank to Sacramento

02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:43.280
right?

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:44.280
So you must be going on Southwest.

02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:45.280
Of course.

02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:46.760
Southwest is just a greyhound bus with wings.

02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:47.760
Exactly.

02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:52.800
I love how the stewardess just don't care anymore like do you want peanuts?

02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:55.240
You want to have some peanuts?

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:59.800
The thing that pisses me off is that I used to be neurotic about signing on 24 hours in

02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:05.840
advance so I could get the A1 boarding pass, but now they got smart and they sell like

02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:10.080
one through thirty for an additional ten bucks so I could be the first one on at like you

02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:15.960
know 24 hours before and I'll have like B1 to board and like that is soul crushing.

02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:21.800
I used to have to do that for my boss, she was always flying Southwest if you're a law

02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:26.800
firm and yeah she was completely anal retentive about that though but the funniest thing now

02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:30.040
is that, I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but I said maybe like if you're a B

02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:34.080
and it's really obvious and now they have the standing in the number order, don't give

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:38.720
a shit, they just take you like you know you don't have to stand at like you could stand

02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:41.680
at 16 if you're number 50 they don't care.

02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:45.600
Right yeah it's not exact but you definitely have those people that are like oh excuse

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.400
me I believe you need to be on this side of the sign because you're holding that number.

02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:55.120
You just put your hand over that part just like where you're holding it you know.

02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:57.120
I know.

02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:00.600
So yeah although I didn't have to get scanner molested which was nice because I was knocking

02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:02.320
off for that picture.

02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:06.640
I've had the nudie pictures taken I was in a really bad mood the day it was at the Oakland

02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:10.640
airport and that was the day that the tires caught on fire like go back a few episodes

02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:15.000
is when I was trying to do like a secret trip or whatever we just the whole thing just got

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.320
ruined and I was at the Oakland airport and I had a nudie picture taken it was like that

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:23.680
part of the day where like I just didn't even care anymore and like it wasn't the part that

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:28.280
they were taking the picture to bother me but they were just being such jerks like you

02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.360
need to put your hands up sir it's like give someone a badge and it just gives them the

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:37.000
right to be a total asshole you know it's like god learn customers as someone who taught

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:42.120
customer service for nine years a lot of those like security type people really bother me

02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:46.120
really bother me yeah they actually at least from my experience they're really nice at

02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.480
Burbank but I mean you talk about those image scanners I mean there's plenty of images have

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:53.960
already shown up showed up on the internet okay you take a scan of somebody that has

02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:58.240
gigantic boobs or a big way or something unusual on your body they don't get paid enough to

02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:03.200
be professional I'm sorry the doctor they're totally gonna be like hey guys look at this

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:08.000
check this out and you know like I said you know I'll opt for the pat down and I mean

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:12.320
unlike anyone you know over 14 nowadays I actually haven't that that picture of me from

02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:18.400
the site is like the dirtiest thing of me I'll find dry right um but um but yeah I'll

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:22.760
opt for the pat down and my professor was saying in my law class that um that they even

02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:29.280
check your cleavage now I'm like great this will take two days I better get the hard hat

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.400

02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:38.080
where she just pulls out still I can plug like a lamp I don't like cleavage and you

02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:42.880
know like I just you know just she has an umbrella with a parrot head that talks to

02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:48.720
her yeah her boobs exactly so airports are fun no I don't mind having the nudie pictures

02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:53.480
taking is just like you know what what's sit here and memorize it why don't you just strike

02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:57.880
a pose that's what my one of my friends when we were at the airport she got picked for

02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:01.440
around when we went to Boston for PAX East funny enough she got picked for the random

02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:05.000
screening because then it was not everybody did it it was just random or I don't know

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.880
if maybe it's still that way now so I didn't have to do it but Amanda had to do it and

02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:14.780
she she was excited she's like I get to do the nudie picture so she's like running over

02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:17.880
there and she like totally does this pose where she has her hands up and she's like

02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:21.400
do this because she's fucking adorable to begin with and then she does this whole like

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:26.160
little like pose thing when she's standing there and I'm just like you are having way

02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:29.640
too much fun with the nudie picture taking I like the people that have the idea of doing

02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:35.560
the the spinal tap thing and having a cucumber wrapped in a wrap and foil in your pants so

02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:41.140
you know my spinal tap it oh boy when that is that can you bring can you technically

02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:45.800
bring a cucumber wrapped in foil well they try they find it in the scanner but you cannot

02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:51.640
as they put in the spinal tap that was lunch I needed something to suck on on the plane

02:12:51.640 --> 02:13:00.000
anyhow let's move on hey more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the skype

line at 1877 game OLR as if this show couldn't go any further down the toilet we're about

02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:10.680
to open it up to callers 1877 game OLR but not just yet we still have a couple more stories

02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:19.160
for you guys yeah this is kind of neat apparently EA Tiburon is rumored to be in early development

02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:25.800
for a new NFL blitz because hey Midway sucked it up with that series and Warner didn't do

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:31.960
too much better so now they're gonna give it a new shot since hey you know NBA Jam did

02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:38.760
all right and so I don't know NFL blitz could be kind of fun I liked NFL blitz someone played

02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:45.480
any NBA Jam yet though this is a new one but they say they probably won't arrive until

02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:55.480
2012 so it's rumored for now all right I like rumors I guess NFL blitz is kind of cool so

02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.680
be interesting if that's coming back as well as NBA Jam did earlier this year I'm sorry

02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:04.600
I'm just distracted by a link that was posted in chat by solar flare fig leaf yes it's a

02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:10.120
it's like I guess you can buy like panties or boxer briefs or whatever that have a giant

02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:15.240
fig leaf on them that are made of some type of radiation proof material so when they scan

02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:19.600
you the little fig leaf will come up instead to be for bras too yeah oh you can get you

02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:28.640
get the hands for the bras like the barber Streisand dress or I don't know if you've

02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:34.240
seen burlesque yet but there's there's definitely a nod to that there's been a hot mess of glitz

02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:39.360
and glam I did see burlesque this week the day after Thanksgiving and it was actually

02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:45.000
no I saw it on Thanksgiving and it was it was it was very very very gay it was share

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:51.240
the best more complaining that it wasn't hot mess enough that's it's it's for look if you're

02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:56.000
gonna go see burlesque and you're gonna go see a movie starring Sharon Christina Aguilera

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:00.400
you ought to know exactly what you're gonna get and the movie does deliver you you get

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:08.240
exactly that but I'm just saying it's it's it's a movie starring share I mean there's

02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:13.380
you know if this is for you or not like there's no surprise here target I would not recommend

02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:17.320
Loki go see this unless maybe he wants to check out there are some scantily clad women

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.520
but they don't ever deliver on the actual man I know I say where's the real burlesque

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:27.720
with the pasties and yeah no they don't do anything it is kind of like it's it's watered

02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:31.560
down burlesque a little bit but I but then but then there's that part of me it's like

02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:36.540
but share is a fucking fierce fierce bitch and she steals every scene she's in every

02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:42.400
scene share is an extended lady marmalade video yeah that's fair that's fair but with

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:46.440
share and she's made of awesome so and I know I know a lot of the listeners probably want

02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:49.440
to hear this but we'll have girl talk here for a minute I will say the guy that plays

02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:54.480
Christina Aguilera's love interest in the movie is smoking hot smoking hot he kind of

02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:59.840
he reminded me of the previous of a young Cary Elwes but he's aged weird so yes yeah

02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:07.840
yeah I saw Cary Elwes in the a preview for Saw 3D and I was like oh wow wow he's back

02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.860
in that yeah he's he's and then it's good I don't really like to follow the Saw movies

02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:17.480
from what I understand they bring him back as part of a flashback people who know people

02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:24.760
who've all survived the games from prior but he didn't survive I don't know whatever chat

02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:32.480
wants to know was it better or worse than showgirls on a scale of one to showgirl here's

02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:38.640
the thing though I love showgirls because it's so bad it's good and it burlesque isn't

02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:43.360
really like that I don't think burlesque was bad it was just it was like a movie from the

02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:47.840
nineteen forties you know exactly what's going to happen the plot you see coming from a mile

02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:53.960
away it's not really any surprises but if you're just going to you know have fun and

02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:58.720
just not really think for a couple hours it's good for that I heard people complaining they

02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:04.000
want it to be showgirls era hot mess no it's not that much of a gamer topic what about

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:10.360
burlesque the game well I'd like to see that on Xbox connect actually have to actually

02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:16.080
they have to shake your titties and you know that somebody's going to come up with something

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:22.240
like because it's sort of connect thing specifically for that oh hey back to video games I do have

02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:28.100
one more a actually funny enough this is about the boobs and connect so maybe they could

02:17:28.100 --> 02:17:34.320
use this in a burlesque type game but the Xbox 360 is connect it can track the head

02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:39.440
it can track the hands but now we can track the breasts that's right this is Dan Wilcox

02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:43.920
actually hacked the connect to see if it could spot his chest and what happens is that the

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:51.100
computer is looking for his man boobs and draws a bra or pasties on top and music plays

02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:56.920
when titties are detected so sure enough there's this little video called the connect titty

02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:12.440
tracker and the guys moving back and forth and like it draws a little bra on his chest

02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:19.280
that's a CBS needs I don't know why it's all skippy I don't know if that's the program

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:31.840
or what that's because the music so there goes I look for a person size blob and use

02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:38.640
it centroid to approximate a search box wherein to detect two boobs so I don't know if it

02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.640
would work on women yet but we haven't seen that video or at least it's not appropriate

02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:49.000
to be on family websites I don't know but there you go the connect can now officially

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:59.880
track your movies so you are just giggling away too much rob like a little so much stupid

02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:07.200
shit on tonight's show like really I love it all right we're gonna go ahead and open

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:11.720

02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:51.840
launch radio who's this hi uh this is spazzinator hi spazzinator did you call in to talk about

02:19:51.840 --> 02:20:01.320
boobs uh well that wasn't my intention but sure why not they're always relevant uh what

02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:09.360
did you call in to talk about tonight um well as I had mentioned on uh twitter uh and working

02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:16.680
new and turning red uh earlier in the show um I was going to talk about uh that new voodoo

02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:21.280
service over on uh playstation notebook oh yes tell us a little bit about voodoo because

02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:27.400
I'm not very familiar with it what is uh what's up with voodoo um well I started to know it's

02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:35.800
a relatively new service it I think it's uh started by either walmart or best buy or one

02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:43.480
of those big you know retail chains it's uh basically they're equivalent to uh the playstation

02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:52.920
network video store um you know you know you know basically you can uh rent uh or buy movies

02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:59.760
uh from their service kind of like what you can do from playstation network uh and plus

02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:08.880
it has um you know you know full twitter and facebook integration on that and and not only

02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:16.200
that but um you know you know you get you know here's kind of a unusual you know interface

02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:24.760
twitter at least unusual compared to say uh uh the xbox uh xbox video marketplace and

02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:33.720
compared to uh playstation network where uh now it has uh a multi-page menu to it where

02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:39.320
you know it'll give you a whole bunch of information regarding the movie like uh like a platform

02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:44.240
oops sorry I'm on the website and it started a video I hate this fucking autoplay shit

02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.640
sorry I was on the voodoo website trying to educate myself but it started an autoplay

02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:57.280
video well basically it has a multi-page uh menu to it where it'll tell you you know all

02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:03.120
about the movie who made it who's in it plot summary so on and so forth even though the

02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:10.400
box art to uh the the movie if you know you know like what you would see on a dvd or blu-ray

02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:17.000
whatever now the only you know there is a uh you know anything interfacing all that

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:23.940
I love the interface you know it's a whole lot better than you know the playstation network

02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:32.400
and you know the market sauce service uh and plus you know with their videos you know you

02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:37.080
can even get five point you know once around sound on the videos so okay so it has a very

02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:44.240
pretty interface does it cost money to use it uh yeah it is basically you know uh you

02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:50.680
know you pay actual dollars and cents to rent or you know rent or buy the movie just like

02:22:50.680 --> 02:23:00.240
you would for uh blockbuster video or hollywood video or anywhere else uh you know unlike

02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:06.600
where uh you know unlike netflix where you got like you know one flat fee rent everything

02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:11.760
now you pay per movie on voodoo all right well you know what I find interesting voodoo

02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:16.960
um I'm reading about it they were just recently bought by walmart so it's the walmart movie

02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:20.760
company now although they're still called voodoo it's actually owned by walmart so I

02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:24.800
hope they don't go in and edit movies like they do cds that get sold in the stores that

02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:32.400
would be disappointing uh yeah and the thing is with the voodoo app over on places network

02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:37.720
they actually give you the first rental free uh everything else after that you know you

02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:41.520
have to pay for so does that mean everybody can go get one free movie just by like signing

02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:48.760
up yep no all you gotta do is print like an email address well yeah everybody has an email

02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:55.080
address they send all their spam to so that'll work yeah now the there's like a couple minor

02:23:55.080 --> 02:24:01.520
downsides to it um well even now I should wait I gotta say I gotta say hold on this

02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:06.840
is very interesting I'm sorry voodoo apparently uh at one point actually would rent adult

02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:12.040
titles but on february 25th to comply with the policies of its parents company voodoo

02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:18.440
discontinued operated sorry discontinued operating the avn after dark channel which had the adult

02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:25.280
movies on it oh now see I it's a bummer they didn't keep that open because I was I've been

02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:29.480
saying this for the longest time whoever brings us the porto first is going to win this video

02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:35.800
on demand war so if uh voodoo had done it man nobody would even be talking about hulu

02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:44.480
because voodoo has the titties yeah uh there's I you know despite all the things I do like

02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:49.240
about the voodoo servers there's a couple things I don't like about and which are kind

02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:55.540
of major issues uh first of all you can't like download any videos that you rent or

02:24:55.540 --> 02:25:02.000
buy locally to your hard drive you have to stream it okay uh and combine that with the

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:08.360
fact that you have to be logged into playstation network while you're viewing the movies so

02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:13.640
if god forbid you know for whatever reason your internet goes out or whatever basically

02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:24.080
you're s o l uh and not uh not only that but I have um as a side note a really fast internet

02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:31.120
connection roughly about 20 megabits per second and even with that and having every other

02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:39.760
device turned off like my 360 and psp and so forth when I rented the high you know the

02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:46.960
really high quality uh hd uh the expendables with 5.1 surround sound that the movie was

02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:54.280
constantly stuttering trying to buffer and whatnot and you know you know that shouldn't

02:25:54.280 --> 02:26:00.280
happen you know because I have a fast internet service and not only that but uh every it

02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:09.320
seems like every minute half to two minutes uh you know it literally would stop streaming

02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:15.080
out the gallery saying oh yeah we can't no there's some kind of a problem we you know

02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:19.960
I can't stream this as a movie try back later all right so it sounds like there might still

02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:23.840
be some uh network issues I gotta wrap up so we can get more calls but I kind of want

02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:28.080
to get the quick bottom line what's like the one sentence bottom line on this is it worth

02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:32.000
checking out and getting your free movie or you know what no there's still too many problems

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:38.880
right now if you can you know uh if you're willing to deal with a few uh headaches go

02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:46.020
ahead and try it you know there's a free rental but you know I wouldn't actually pay money

02:26:46.020 --> 02:26:50.600
out of pocket for it though all right there you have it spazzinator thanks for the review

02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:55.600
on voodoo we're gonna uh let you guys get more calls all right have a good one all right

02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:00.320
have a good one later all right it's a bummer he missed out on all the pornography but I

02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:06.800
guess I guess that was the pre-playstation 3 era or something idk uh 1877 game olr if

02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:08.780
a dance off item and it's actual ddr you play with like you know you press the buttons uh

02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:13.000
up down left right on your d-pad I don't know if they have support for the pad phone could

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:18.520
confirm that for me when they have it and you do it to earn points it's pretty cool

02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:26.480
but I have yet to do win a match because I uh I'm white well just because you recommended

02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:30.360

02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:51.600
could people dress up as turkeys because I remember one of their big events was the furry

02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:59.680
event you chase the turkeys around and you could get a turkey costume I swear home is

02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:04.600
like not even home doesn't even try to hide that it's catering to the furries it really

02:30:04.600 --> 02:30:09.600
doesn't try to hide it at all well you know they actually have costumes now that you could

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:17.160
dress up as like a cat or a bulldog or stuff like that you know if you're in the home clubs

02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:22.720
I could find like yes masters 4000 club I think the people that need to know that already

02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:32.800
know it what can I do anything with the olr club now I don't I'm not sure I've uh I kind

02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:37.920
of cancelled my join request because I uh I know we got full we got they can we can

02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:43.960
only hold 25 people and by some miracle of god there's more than that but I'm not sure

02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:48.680
oh if that's true then I'll go add more people hold on I got sent a video of ddr and playstation

02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:54.720

02:30:54.720 --> 02:31:03.600
let me see if this gets interesting at all oh hold on I turn the audio and it has the

02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:09.400
whole like chibi music oh a group dance-off is starting it looks like any douchebaggy club

02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:16.520
on sunset oh it is you have to pay ten dollars to get in there and get stared at by bouncers

02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:24.600
so wow it is kind of ddr and home I'll give it that that's okay it's just kind of interesting

02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:28.120
nice little mini game you know something to do on home because there's really not much

02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:34.120
to do on home why does the guy have like landing flares

02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:38.280
I want to get in the costume and go dancing home like this why am I not seeing like a

02:31:38.280 --> 02:31:43.520
single pedo bear on the dance floor that's what I want to know I saw some dude dressed

02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:50.960
up as like mr muscle man up there like speedo and it was just like I was at a race from

02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:55.520
yes exactly from what's that get wait this guy wait look at this guy over here hold on

02:31:55.520 --> 02:32:02.480
this guy his pants are sagging hold on his pants are sagging so bad and he's not wearing

02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:08.280
a shirt buy him a belt like if there isn't look at that there is no question if it's

02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:15.360
boxers or briefs pants on the ground pants on the ground pants on the ground they're

02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:24.720
ddring too pants on the ground so yeah anything else in home besides pants on the ground and

02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:33.720
uh actually if your pants could go on the ground home would probably be a lot more popular

02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:37.760
with a certain crowd midway which is like that one place in the fan of business where

02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:42.920
is on the pier whatever that place is you can play like carnival games there and earn

02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:48.520
prizes it's still you know standard home affair and I don't see how it's still open beta it's

02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:52.640
been open beta forever it's just like gmail's been in beta for well actually I think gmail

02:32:52.640 --> 02:32:56.400
finally came out of beta like five years later I think it's just like they put it there open

02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:01.400
beta just to say it's gonna grow it's just a constant reminder that they don't owe you

02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:06.560
shit that's really the beta tag being on there so long is really just a reminder like we

02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:13.360
don't owe this to you from clothing that costs fifteen dollars like no joke fifteen dollars

02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:23.600

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:38.800
there yeah well the expansion is really uh as usual really nice and but the whole but

02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:47.520
the whole thing is that will be celebrity thing is uh a bit stupid as one can be expected

02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:57.360
but the uh and the vampire thing is kind of like make almost in some way but uh what are

02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:05.200
there well the kind of like good thing is that well we finally have penthouse and such

02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:14.240
and apartments which is kind of good in one way if you're having a small sims family so

02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:18.120
you can get a penthouse huh all right I'm liking where this is going do you get to get

02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:27.000
a $15 gold suit no you no you can't not yet all right yeah do they do anything else besides

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:34.240
just like items are there new like game modes or new things experience oh um what are there

02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:48.040
like uh um new skills no uh oh yeah the new uh like uh music stuff is kind of cool afterwards

02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:55.760
once you get the hang of it even and one and one the annoying part about uh vampires that

02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:02.200
really frustrate frustrates me like hell is that if you have vampire children they can

02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:10.680
skill up in their skill that they're doing at the moment like instant really hold on

02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:17.920
hold on be it hold on back up rewind press pause you can be a vampire now in the sims

02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:27.600
yeah can you sparkle so you can well be all the that series do you get to sparkle is just

02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:35.680
like twilight vampires no no it's not exactly like that oh thank god we do they don't sparkle

02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:41.920
oh thank god so they're not mormon vampires yeah okay there are vampires but there aren't

02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:50.960
aren't any werewolves so it's not the so it's not 100 twilight of sorts well that's that's

02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:55.880
a relief thank god so you can you can do more like uh i don't know dark shadows as opposed

02:39:55.880 --> 02:40:04.320
to because like dark shadows cool vampires twilight not cool vampires big difference

02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:15.080
barnabas awesome r patinson not awesome anyhow oh yeah but one of the one of the ways kind

02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:21.400
of like cool is that the um you have now uh you can actually build like you can build

02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:32.960
your own swimming pool uh within uh on uh like send a few stories up of sorts say this

02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:38.880
it seems before you couldn't actually build that build a swimming pool on your second

02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:46.460
floor yes i could drown people on my roof and wait can you can you torture the vampires

02:40:46.460 --> 02:40:51.840
by like putting them in sunlight or like you know putting a bunch of garlic in the kitchen

02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:58.040
that's really like fun because uh if you because they don't because the vampires here don't

02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:06.360
they can't uh be in the twilight be in the uh sun that often but if you do you will get

02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:16.880
this oh can't do much and they uh like um oh how do you say though they uh they uh oh

02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:24.800
they lose their hands so it's quite it's quite hilarious i haven't killed anyone yet doing

02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:30.520
that torturing the sims is the whole reason to play sims you need to get on that yeah

02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:36.740

some nice very very very very nice clothing for your sims do we mean lack of clothing

02:41:52.360 --> 02:42:00.240
or like actual clothing actual clothing in this one because sometimes nice clothing means

02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:05.160
like you know all these new bras and panties for your sims to run around in all day long

02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:10.960

02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:15.280

xbox live arcade but there is a way you can get to play it and actually be it's a way

02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:43.440
of promoting the game virally i guess and it is out um for free on windows phone 7 devices

02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:47.980
but on xbox live arcade there is a way to download the demo which if you want to you

02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:54.600
can download the full game um before it's released and to do that you go to the website

02:43:54.600 --> 02:44:07.780
which is um wp7 super secret access dot elo milo that's i l o m i l o dot com so wp7 super

02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:14.640
secret access dot elo milo dot com you should um uh copy paste that link in chat so our

02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:19.740
