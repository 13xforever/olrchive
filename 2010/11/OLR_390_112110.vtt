Who's the host?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Dark Sakura

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, November 21st, 2010

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Layoffs and downsizing hit four game studios

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Developers pay a premium to create the 3DS

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And did Nintendo give away a prototype version of a classic game?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
The video game podcast where every gamer has a voice

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
We do tape live and for all the information to listen to us live

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'll be working with you over the next few hours with my co-host

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
The one and only Dark Sakura

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Hi

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi, how are you? Dark Sakura?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Jamie Summers

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm alright

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Happiest bunny on the farm?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You seem like a little bit of a sad bunny tonight

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I am a little bit of a sad bunny but it's alright

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Do you want a hug? I'll come give you a hug

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I prefer the chocolate ones, thank you

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
You need candy

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Alright, well I hope some discussion on video games will help brighten your spirits

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
You know, I had a terra-bad week this week

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I mean, it was really awful

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Was it bigger than a giga-bad?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
It was a terra-bad, actually

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
That's what I was saying

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
It was

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, but I did the other show

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Because now I'm juggling two shows just like you

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And that actually put me in a lot better mood

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
So podcasting hopefully will brighten your spirits

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
We'll see

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Cool, I was watching V before you came over

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
New V or old V?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
New V

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I stopped about halfway on new V

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Not because I hated it

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
It was hard for me to watch TV every week

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I caught up on Supernatural so I was just sitting

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Marathon-ing stuff because I didn't feel like doing anything

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
I heard a lot of people that kind of like watch TV while they play games

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
A friend of mine on the WoW guild was telling me about how he was leveling to 80

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
While watching Arrested Development on Netflix

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Fun

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
So, yeah, good times

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Alright, say hello as well to somebody who will hopefully make us laugh tonight

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
If not, he's fired

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
No, just kidding

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Hello

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
How are you, Loki?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm fine

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Alright, what's new in your world?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Anything new, fun going on?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Not much, just eating bad for me pizza

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Alright, is your mic even on?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
We are having a real hard time hearing you tonight

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Did you plug me in the wrong hole again?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
No, you're good

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I just, we just had to get you angry in order to hear you, I think

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
No?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I don't, it's very quiet

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
It's very, very quiet

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Live radio, some of the perks

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
We'll try and fix his stuff all in one

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Fix me now!

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
No, you're definitely fixed now, alright

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Everybody's just all quiet and somber tonight

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Must be the weather

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
The weather changing is

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I call it complete and utter apathy

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Last night was, was it thunder, I was in the bay

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
But it was thunderstorming, like crazy

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
It was fantastic

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
It was a light the candles type of day

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I love rain, I love rain a lot

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
But the whole problem with rain is that it makes me intensely homesick

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And also nobody can drive in the rain

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Is the other big problem

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Nobody from here

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
No, yeah, big problem with the rain

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Alright, if you've never listened to Orange Launch Radio before

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I haven't given this spiel in a while, so I'll just say hello

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
If you've never listened to our show before, we do tape live

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
And the three of us here, Dark Soccer, myself and Loki

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
We all met playing video games at the local arcade

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
It was Dance Dance Revolution, ironically enough

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Was the game that brought us together

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
So for a long time we did a show about music games

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
And, well, things evolve, things change

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And now we're podcasting about all the video games that are out there

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
From the classics, Atari 2600, NES, Sega

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
All the way to the new stuff on the PS3 and 360

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
We like to talk about the news and talk about it with you guys

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Cause, you know, we, we know you guys are smart

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
You go on game blogs, if you subscribe to this show

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
You probably read the big game blogs

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
You already know a lot of the news

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
But we like to talk about it and discuss it

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
And get your perspective

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And to do that we always have the present fourth guest on our show

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
The chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
But of course we're also gonna take calls later in the show

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
There's our Twitter, our Facebook, and all that fun stuff

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
But we do always start off the show with a little bit of

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
How was your gaming week where we talk about the video games

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
You've been playing this week

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Um, kind of, not much of anything

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
I played Star Trek Online for like an hour this week

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
And, yeah, oh, Angry Birds

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
The game is retarded and fun

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Why do you think so many people are into Angry Birds on the iPhone?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Like, I have to admit, it's not a game that's ever really interested me

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
But it seems like everybody is playing this game

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Because pigs aren't kosher

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Okay

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
You just, you fight evil pigs

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh, I see, I see

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
And they're not kosher

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
So I kill them

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
By toppling bricks on top of them

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Until they poof and die

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
And they get all beat up and bruised beforehand

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
So it's really great

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
And you've got chickens that explode

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Poor piggies that can't defend themselves

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Aw

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Um, well they're idiot pigs anyway

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Um

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Maybe that'll be the sequel to Angry Birds, idiot pigs

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
I found my Digimon

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
It's way dead, but I found my old school Digimon

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Was that, did they actually

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
The brick looking ones

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Like, that were like the Tamagotchis?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah, but they could connect

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I never knew they had those

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I always thought Digimon was just like a Gameboy game

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Well, and an anime

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah, but they were actually made from

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
I think the same company that did the Tamagotchi

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Or something like that

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
But anyway, you could connect the two end to end

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And they would battle

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And uh

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
It finally is dead, we finally just got rid of it

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
We cleaned out a lot of stuff in the house

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
I was gonna say, the battery must have given out after all this time

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
You leave a battery in something way too long

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Then it just goes bad

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Um

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
We've got rid of a lot of stuff

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
But we're also sitting aside, I guess, some swag for people

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I guess

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
And

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah, that's about it

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, we picked a Brad Racer

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Did I say that already last week?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I don't remember

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Did you get some Elite 3D glasses to go with it?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
No

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
No

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And uh

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah, that's about it

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
That's really about it

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Alright

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing this week?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Um

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Not as much as I was going to

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
But I played basically Grand Theft Auto

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And some of the Kinect stuff

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Like I was demonstrating the Kinect things for a few of my

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Fellow employees

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So a little bit of Kinect Adventures

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Which is

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
You know, not surprisingly

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Very boring, you know

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
So many times I can play the River Rafting game

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Or even the other games in there without going

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Eh, whatever

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I've been playing more Dance Central

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Which is pretty fun

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Playing some of the more difficult songs

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Which aren't that difficult

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
But it's just different

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
So I was playing Jungle Boogie a little bit

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And um

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Yeah, more Grand Theft Auto

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
That's pretty much it

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I've played some of the iPhones

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
You know, iPod stuff

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
But uh

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Not really anything worth mentioning

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Just like, you know, I've played a few games of

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You know, the Stick Wars stuff

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Um

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I haven't got a chance to play Rage yet

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Um, because I went

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Downloaded it

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Synced it with my iTunes

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And somehow it deleted the game

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Off my iPod

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
And in iTunes I'm like

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
And I also have Lego Harry Potter

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Where I haven't played that yet either

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Is that the one that's supposed to use Kinect?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Like, I knew there was a Harry Potter game that uses Kinect in some fashion

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
No, Lego Harry Potter, it's the one on

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
The iOS stuff

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh, I'm sorry, you're still on iOS

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
No, no, no

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
There's a Harry Potter in Deathly Hallows Part 1

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Okay, that's what I was thinking

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And it has like a little on rail shooter portion

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
That you can use Kinect for

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
But apparently it's really dumb

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, it's early

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Tech demos turned into games

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
It's still tacked on

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Hey, you know what, it's better than nothing

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You know, they could have just done nothing

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Do you find yourself

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Yourself still playing

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Kinect a couple weeks later?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Because I kind of stopped

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Um, yeah, Dance Central

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I've actually been playing Dance Central

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
It's pretty fun actually

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
And funny enough, I got some of my other employees into it

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
They were like really

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
It was surprising

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I didn't think they would try Dance Central

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I had one of my co-workers playing Just Dance

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
This guy, you know

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Purple Belt and Tae Kwon Do

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And stuff

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Just not

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
The person that would be playing

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
That song

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
You know what, there's no shame in having fun

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
No, not at all

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Even if the song's a little fruity, it's fun

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
He thought it was hilarious, so

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah, it's fun

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
The problem really is

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I don't have room to play it

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
So I play it at work

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
We have our game room

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I guess, it's in a conference room

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
So I take the conference room table that's split in two

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
And I push one to one end of the wall

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
One to the other end of the wall

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And it gives me a good ten feet

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
By ten feet space that I can actually play in

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
You don't know how lucky you are to be able to turn

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
In your conference room at work into like

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
A gaming hotspot, it's amazing

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
To me

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah, I guess

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
That's part of the deal

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I guess, so

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Anything else?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, that's pretty much it

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I had a pretty dramatic week

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
In World of Warcraft

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I won't get into all the details

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
The good news is I don't have to subject you guys

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Now that I have the spin-off show, I don't have to subject you guys to all the talk anymore

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
But I'll say it was a very traumatic week

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Because my authenticator reset itself

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah, I don't know how it happened either

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
But I had to make a phone call to Blizzard and all that

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
At least you didn't swallow yours

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
No, what happened?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Some person swallowed their authenticator

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
No, mine's on my iPhone

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And somehow it just reset

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And I couldn't restore it from backup

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
None of it would work

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It would just give me the new serial number

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And you can't input your own serial number

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So, it was weird

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
And then Wednesday, my guild got the first

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Kill of the Lich King ever

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
But I wasn't there because I had to drop out of the raid

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Because Comcast kept cutting out on me

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And so, yep, wasn't there

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
So anyway, I won't get into all the details about it

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
It's on the other show, Horde House now

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
That's kind of odd

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Now I don't get to go on these long Warcraft tangents on the show anymore

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You can still go on the tangents

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Now I feel like I'm spent, I already went on that tangent

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't want to do it again

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So yeah, it was an interesting week in Warcraft

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
But let me talk about other games, because there were other games I was playing as well

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Maybe I wasn't playing the Kinect games so much

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
But I did kind of go on this demo downloading

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Binge of stuff I've just kind of missed on

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
One of those games I checked out was

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Super Meat Boy

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Which, actually was kind of cool

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Like, the demo is very robust for that game

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
I get the sense it's a flash game that's been converted somehow

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
But there's a lot, well it's Newgrounds

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
So that was kind of a sign right there

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
But it had a surprising amount of depth to it

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
One of the mechanics I really liked is that

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
You know, you're on this Mario style map

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Doing all the little challenges

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
But when you get an A plus on a level

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Meaning you beat the level within the par time

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
You can hit a button to go to the dark side

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
And you can hit a button to go to the dark side

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
You can hit a button to go to the dark world

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Where you play the stage again

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And it's like the exact same map

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Only harder

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Like maybe there will be more saw blades out now

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Or more enemies

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
So I thought that was kind of a neat mechanic

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And one of the things I really like

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Is that the game plays very fast

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Every stage is meant to be beat in like under a minute

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
And some of them are literally like 10 seconds long

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So it's almost like micro games

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
But you might have to play the round

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Like, not even kidding

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
50 times

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
To get the rhythm just right

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
To time that jump just right

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
So you can kind of get through the gap

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And do like a jump around

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
You know what I mean when you jump to the right

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And then push control over the left to get around an obstacle

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
You know, you kind of do all these weird sorts of things

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
But what I like is that when you finally beat the level

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
You get to see an instant replay

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
But the instant replay isn't just

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
The replay of you beating it

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It's the replay of every single attempt you made

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
At the level all at once

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And you'll see like 50 little meat guys

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
All jumping and you see them all dying

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
It's actually really clever

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
And a really neat game mechanic

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And I'm sure I've got to have seen this somewhere before

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
But I can't think of anything

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
So I was very surprised at what a robust demo it was

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And I was very pleased with it

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And I do plan on buying the full game

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I would have never guessed this was a game that interests me

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Because I'm going to be honest

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And this is going to sound really weird

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And I should be made fun of for this

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And I'm okay with that

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
But the gameplay and the artwork

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Of like that red case with the weird

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Funny green toothy thing

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Made me, honestly

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I kind of looked at it and went, what's this super meat

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
That sounds stupid

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
That game sounds stupid, that looks stupid

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
It's kind of amazing how much judgement

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I passed on this game, really not knowing dick about it

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And I was wrong

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I can admit that

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
But at the same time

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I was a little kind of turned off by

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Why didn't you try to like

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I don't know, put a little more

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Into the retro

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Jokes like on the box art

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Or something, like that whole like red gritting

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Face just was a little silly to me

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I don't know, I'm sure

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm not even looking at chat because I'm sure I'm being

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Taunted for being irrational right now

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
But it did kind of make me step back and go

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Wow, you do kind of put a lot of thought

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Into even like what's on the front

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Of a box

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
As to whether I'll pull it off the shelf

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And I realize this is all happening virtually

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I'll pull it off the shelf and read the back of the box

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
So, kind of interesting

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
So again if you want to go

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com you can join us

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Okay now I'm being brave and reading it there

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Um

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Let's see, uh

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Sorry I'm reading this live here

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Dark Tetsuya says

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Don't forget Alien Hominid was a Newgrounds

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Game too, that's true, that was kind of a cool game

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
The Castle Crashers, was that a Newgrounds?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
It was the very same style

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Very similar style

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Only Hemeth did that and they had done

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Alien Hominid, I think that's the deal

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
They've done Alien Hominid, yeah

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
So I played that and I definitely want to pick up the full

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Version of that, I also played Pac-Man Championship

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Edition DX

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Which I thought was kind of a worthy

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Upgrade based on the demo I played

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
You know, more maps

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Different skins looking thing

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
But they also made a couple big changes to the mechanic

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
That make it worthy of an upgrade, one of them is

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Bombs, which I know sounds very weird for a Pac-Man

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Game, but how often

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
In Pac-Man do you get trapped in a corner

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Where there's a ghost coming one way and there's

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
A ghost coming the other way and you're like, oh shit

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I'm fucked, now I realize that's the whole point

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Of Pac-Man, but this being a sequel

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
You get to try new things, so now you have

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
A bomb and you can hit this bomb and it

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Blows the ghost out of your way

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
So you can get through, it's

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
A simple thing that kind of adds

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
A whole new level to it, I don't want to say it makes it easier

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
But now you can

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Get yourself in different situations

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Than you were able to before, if that makes sense

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
The other thing that's kind of cool

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
About the game is that you have these like

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Sleeping ghosts, we'll say

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
These ghosts that just stand in place and don't do anything

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Until you go right next to them

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And once you go right next to them

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
They'll wake up and start to chase you

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
But they chase you in a very

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Logical pattern, like they just keep following you

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And if you do this right

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
You'll get like 30 ghosts

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
All in a row, and then pick up a power pellet

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And you'll just go chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And you'll just rack up a high score there

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
So I thought that was kind of a neat new

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Mechanic, so just a couple new little twists

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Kind of breeze fresh life

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Into a game and I thought it was pretty awesome

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
And the music was really cool

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So yeah, I gotta say

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I haven't read on the net

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
What the reception is to this game, I don't know if people

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Are saying unnecessary copy or whatever

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
But I gotta admit, I find the

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Few little twists

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
To really kind of bring new life

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Into what was otherwise a game that you know

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Was, you know, it's been on the iPhone

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And the Xbox

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
You know, we've kind of seen it

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Several times over the past few years, so

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I thought that was cool, so

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandsreader.com

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Salacious Pop says, it's amazing

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
The music alone, if you use a bomb

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
On a chain of 40 plus ghosts and they all fly back

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Into the base, it's a very epic satisfying

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Feeling, that's very true

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I agree with that

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Black Wolf is clarifying an earlier comment I was saying

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Castle Crashers used Newgrounds for the music

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
At least, that makes sense

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
There was, definitely

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
A lot of those games have the same look

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
And feel and so forth

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Another game I checked out on Xbox Live

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Again, these are all demos and I always feel weird

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
About reviewing demos, but a lot of these were very

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Robust, and I think

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Still

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
When you're gonna put a demo of your game

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Out there, you're kind of putting

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It out there to be, to have

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Your entire game judged, should I drop

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
$10 on this, yes or no

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I feel somewhat justified in that

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Salacious Pop is reminding me

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I also played Guang

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Guangi?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I don't even know how to pronounce this game, but I did play that

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
On Xbox Live, and

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I know we have a really diehard

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Shmup fan in the chatroom that's gonna really hate me

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
For this, but I didn't get it, I didn't get it at all

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I liked that it was

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Different, but I didn't understand

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
What the hell I was doing, it was just bullets everywhere

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Ahh!

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Apparently there's reskinned modes, but they're not really in the demo

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
It was just the first level of the arcade game that was in the demo

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I had no idea what the eff I was doing

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You know, not being the big

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It seems like a lot of the

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Cave shooters that they're bringing over

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
No offense, it's like

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
You could like

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Randomly show me different, you know

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Video from a bunch of different ones

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
They all look the same

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Well, but to be fair, Loki, this game wasn't

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
The same, and that was kind of what

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I will say I liked about it, because

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
What was cool about it is that

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
For one, this character I was playing

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
You didn't just fire bullets, but you had a

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Wolf that you moved around the screen

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
And bombs would fire from

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
The wolf or something, I don't know

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
But it was a different mechanic

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
So it didn't make it feel like every other shoot-em-up

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
So I don't think you can say every shoot-em-up

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Is the same, it's just that

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Because maybe I was

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Expecting to understand it

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Because I played a lot of other shoot-em-ups

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It was really confusing to me

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
At first, but I don't know

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I don't know

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Um

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Anyhow, that was

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
That was the game

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
If I spent more time with it, I'd probably enjoy it

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Or if I was more of a fan of the

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Shoot-em-up games, and really understood

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
What was so different

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I should have spent more time with it, really

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
But again, demos were supposed to sell me on the full games

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And after playing the demos I did

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
This week, I'm like, I'm more interested in going back

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And playing more Super Meat Boy, which I never thought

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I'd say a couple weeks ago

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
They have that

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
To internets on there and stuff

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
That they unlock new levels

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Every now and

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Every once in a while without sort of

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Updates, I guess

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Did you say Super Meat Boy? Oh, no

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I wasn't aware of that, that's cool

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It seemed like there was a lot of

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
People

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Ray in our chat room is a little irritated

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
At what Loki just said

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I could say the same of any genre

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
All MMOs are the same

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
All genre are the same

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah, but I'm saying that the actual artwork

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Looks very similar game to game

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm not saying all shooters are the same

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
That doesn't make any sense

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I'm saying that these games play very much alike

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Like, I played a bunch of different cave shooters

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
And they play very similar

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I'm telling you, this doesn't play like the other ones

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Oh, big deal

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
It's a different thing that they added in there

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
It was different

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Because you could kind of

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Fire at the bullets and stuff

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I don't think

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
People should pass judgment so quickly

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
It's still fun, I'm just saying

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
At least try it out

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
They're not like night and day

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
It's not like comparing

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
A Gradius game with

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Ikaruga or something like that

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Two games that have very different

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Looks to them

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Maybe similar

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Types of gameplay, obviously

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Ikaruga would be a lot harder

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I don't know

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Maybe it's just because they're all done with spray

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Animation and stuff like that

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
It just seems very

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Similar

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You could show me one of those games and be like

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Oh man, that was a cave shooter

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I don't know

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I don't get it

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Why even bother having any storylines in it?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
There's no point, really

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
And the last demo I played was for

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
King of Fighters 2002

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Which, um

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I didn't get it

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I actually played the Neo Geo fighting franchises

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Past Fatal Fury Special

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I think was about the last one

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
With the exception of Capcom vs SNK

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Which is still amazing

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
The problem is the demo only limits you to

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
A handful of characters

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
None of which I recognized

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And all I did was I button masked

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
The chick with the whip

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
And I think her name was actually Whip

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Yes, her name is Whip

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And she's on Team Ikari

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Very creative

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
No, she's actually a really cool character

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
And if you're good with her, she's really effective

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
But I always use Leona

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
But who you can't pick in the demo, I don't think

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I would have recognized her, so I don't know

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I didn't get a good feel for that one from the demo

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
She was on the same team with Leona, Clark, Ralph

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Haytern

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
She's, I guess, Ikari themed

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
In the one I played, you were picking teams

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
You were picking individuals

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
But I'm saying that her story

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Her character comes from the whole Ikari team

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Alright

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
That's awesome

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
They did a Marvel vs. Capcom game

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
But Capcom vs. SNK

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Do it in that style again

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Now I know that they've had Capcom vs. SNK

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
1 and 2 and stuff

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
But the crazy over the top style

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
That is Marvel vs. Capcom

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Would be awesome

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Because I'm sorry

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Just plain as the Metal Slug characters

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I know they have

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
An SNK game that came out

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I think it's already out

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
In Xbox Live Arcade

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
That's a port of an arcade game

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It's like Neo Geo

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Battle Colosseum

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
That has a bunch of those different characters

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
But it's just not

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
It's not as cool as

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Or fast as

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Marvel vs. Capcom or something

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
So that's pretty much all the games

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I played this week that are worth mentioning

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Although I did play Knights of the Clicky

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Clicky Vampire Sorority Life

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Farm Town Wars

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
That too

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
It's so sad

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Facebook games really are the future

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And there's really no depth to this game

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
But aren't the boss fights really cool?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
They do these little cut scenes and stuff

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
That makes the whole game worth it to me

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
They're alright, you're in my party

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
You're shaking your head disapprovingly Loki

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
You don't like Knights of the Clicky Vampire

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I haven't played it

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And I'm not going to play it

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I support you in that, it's fine

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I really should not play that

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Because if people support games like that

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
They're just going to keep making games like that

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Well I don't give them money, and I will not give them money

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And Alan always teases me

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Like, you know you want to buy Squeenix coins

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Just to get yourself this stupid armor

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
No! No no no no

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And he knows how I feel

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
No, I'm not spending money

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Rob, I have to go do something

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Orange lunch foodie-o related

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Make some orange soup

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
My soup is orange

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And what's the soup of the day?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Actually it's soup that I made

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It's soup that I made

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Butternut squash sweet potato pumpkin soup

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
With curry and ginger spices

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
With shaved onion zucchini and squash in it

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
And I made it, it's delicious

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Thanksgiving is definitely right around the corner

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
It is, and we have to roast a turkey

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
We haven't done turkey before

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Are you doing the dinner this year?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
No, but we have to contribute another turkey

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
So I'm making the stuffing for it

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And I have a total recipe in my head

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
For cranberry apple stuffing

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Cornbread stuffing

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Because cornbread stuffing is the best

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I'm officially sick of bacon pizza by the way

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I noticed you did not bring bacon pizza

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
To the show tonight, it was like mushroomy pizza

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Or was it actually bacon?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
No, that is bacon pizza

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
They burnt the crap out of it

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah, thank you

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
That does not look appetizing

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And I actually asked for quadruple bacon pizza

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
But she's like, triple bacon?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I don't think they understand more than three

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
If anyone wants that, I'm not worrying that for you

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Um, no, it's

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
It's a little much, it's very heavy

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I believe Loki is finally admitting

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
There is such a thing as too much bacon

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
No, it's just because

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I didn't have the correct dipping sauce

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I wanted a side of ranch

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Well, ranch in round table speak

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Is the creamy garlic sauce

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
The white sauce that they put on pizzas

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
But some round tables decide

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Hey, you know what, we're gonna get some shitty ranch

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
We're also gonna call that ranch

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Or creamy garlic sauce as well

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
And it's just not as good

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Now if I had that, it would be so much better

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
What you should tell them is that next time

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
That they make it, is to put your bacon on first

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
And then put the cheese on top of it

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
So that the bacon won't burn

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Because the oil from the cheese will saturate the bacon

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And prevent it from burning

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
It's like our own little Paula Deen right here in the studio

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
It's not so bad even with the burnt bacon

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
It's just, it's too much

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I cook

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Don't look at me like that, cause I love Paula Deen

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
She's a frightening looking lady

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Because she totally looks

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Both botoxed and surgicaled

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And still looks

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Really scary old with those

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Overly

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Terrified looking eyes

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Paula Deen is like the Cher

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And you're like the Christina Aguilera

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
It's because she's preserved her body

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
With all that fat that she

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Takes in

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I mean, my god, she's like

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I need to put a stick of butter in this one

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Put a stick of butter in there

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I seem to recall this was a video game podcast

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I don't really remember

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
This is getting back to video games

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I'm just going to make my dinner

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I'm just saying that I'm probably going to stick to like

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Cheese pizza or the twist

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
The twists are damn good

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
You know, have you thought about maybe like a salad?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I don't like salad

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I've tried salad on multiple occasions

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
The only salad that I can tolerate

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Is like a Caesar salad

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And even then, I know that's way not good for me

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I just do not like the taste of

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Plants, okay

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
It's just, it feels very unnatural

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
It's like a cow trying to tap dance

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
It just, it doesn't feel natural

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Eating plants, what do you think our ancestors

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Had to do back in the day?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Well, we've evolved past that now, okay

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Why do I have to eat the damn plants?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
The animals that I'm eating right now

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Have eaten those plants

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Alright, look, we gotta get into

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
And since the pigs, they probably ate garbage too

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
But you know what?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm not going to eat garbage

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Alright

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Housekeeping, before we get into news

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
We will still have a show next week

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I know the holidays are canceling some of your favorite

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Podcasts, but thankfully, Sunday

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Is kind of a nice day to be on

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
So we will still be bringing you new shows

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Tonight, obviously, and next week

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
We're not going to have any time off for the holidays

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
We're working hard for you guys

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Because we love you

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Also, if you want to love us on Facebook

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Please consider joining our little club there

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
On Facebook

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
And everybody likes to like things, so

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Yes, so you should like us on Facebook

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Which I think is actually what you do

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
You don't actually join, you just like

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Because if people can like things like Chase Bank

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Or, you know, Miracle Whip

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Then they can like our damn show

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Or RuPaul to host

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Saturday Night Live and all that stuff

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Although that really should happen

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
No, it shouldn't

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I'm sorry, he's not, she's not funny

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
What?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Stop the show, stop the show

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
She's not funny

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
RuPaul is amazing

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And you need to, have you ever watched

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Drag Race, have you ever watched Drag Race

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I've seen an episode

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Then sit down and shut up, because you're saying no

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
In a creative way, you're saying no

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I'm sorry, it would just be weird

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
It's funny, it is

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Funny, drag queens are

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Funny

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Alright, fine, then if you bring RuPaul on there

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
You need to have at least more than one

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Drag queen on there, because

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Just a show about

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Nothing but drag queens competing to

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Be the biggest

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Cunt of them all

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Well that's not Saturday Night Live, that's why I'm saying

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
You need more drag queens on there if you're gonna bring her on there

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Those guys dress up as chicks all the time

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
On Saturday Night Live

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
This is the only video gaming podcast

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Where you will hear

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
A very straight guy arguing

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
With a very gay guy about drag queens

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I'm just saying

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
RuPaul needs a video game

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
You know you want it

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I'm just telling you

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
If they made a game for Connect called

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You better work

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Okay, I get it

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
See?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
And you know you want RuPaul being all

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Alright, let's see that dance again

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And don't fuck it up

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
But Rob, alternate costume has to be the suit

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
From Drag U

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And we could

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
It could film you on the Connect device

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
But then like as you do better

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
It just starts to put like

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Costume parts on you, it'd be really funny

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And then we make Loki play it

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
And take pictures and upload them to the interwebs

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Hilarity

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
That's up there with Tingle

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Alright, anyhow

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Loomis

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Just join chat

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Just to tell Loki to get a sense of humor

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Hahaha

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Oh, Loki

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Alright, also Twitter

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Not Twitter.com slash RuPaul

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Just saying

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Alright, let's actually get into some video game news

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Which I'm only trying to make you laugh

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Because the news we have is very depressing

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I think it's funny

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Not me

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
You are rude

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
That's hilarious, Bizarre Creations

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Is terrible

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
It's like, hey, you know what

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
We decided to have a really terrible idea

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
And release a Bond game

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
That's based off of no movie whatsoever

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
And we're gonna pimp out Daniel Craig

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
In it again because we apparently

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Own the likeness of Daniel Craig

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
For a long time now, that's why he's also

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
In Goldeneye

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But yes, Bizarre Creations

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
They've done some pretty awesome things

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
And some pretty terrible things

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Awesome being their racing games

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Project Gotham Racing Series

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Cooler, terrible being

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And Geometry Wars

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Yes, Geometry Wars, the awesome

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Racing game

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
What the hell, you need to listen

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
No, Geometry Wars is an amazing game

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Stop interrupting me

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
No!

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Yes, you shut up

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Other things that were awesome

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Non-racing

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Geometry Wars

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Terrible things that they've released

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
The Club

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Yes, they're

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
No, The Club, their shooter that wasn't

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Quite good

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
And of course, James Bond

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Bloodstone, which

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Not very good, but it also has some driving in there

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
But driving apparently is better than the Bond game

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Anyhow

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
So they're getting closed down

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Because apparently

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
They aren't making enough money for their pimps

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
At Activision

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
And

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Apparently they're giving them a 90 day period

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Which I guess

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Is serving as notice to the

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Employees that their company is likely to be

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Closed, sold, downsized, etc.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And apparently

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Activision says over the past three years since

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Our purchase of Bizarre Creations

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
The fundamentals of racing genres

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Have significantly changed

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Although we

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Made a substantial investment

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
In creating a new IP

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Blur

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
It did not find a

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Commercial audience

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Mind you, that they're

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Still keeping the Tony Hawk

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Ride franchise around

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Even though that's

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Incredibly terrible

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
But, you know, Blur

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
A racing game that probably had a decent

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Following, just not exactly, you know

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Tony Hawk

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Ride numbers, maybe

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Which I do know that they sold more than Tony Hawk

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Ride, by the way

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
And then of course

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Other developers and whatever

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
And there is a chance though

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
That they may be purchased by somebody else

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Obviously

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Because Project Gotham Racer is an awesome

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Series

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
It's funny how they sucked when they were bought

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
By Activision, but they were still pretty awesome

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
When they were with Microsoft

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Could it happen to be maybe

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Activision is to blame?

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Hey Jamie, knock knock

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Who's there? Interrupting cow

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Boo!

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
That's all I know how to do is interrupt people

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Well you weren't

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Listening, obviously, because you're like

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Hey, guess what

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Geometry Wars was awesome

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Hey, listen

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I just feel, you know, that's

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Right, it was an awesome game

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
But it wasn't an awesome racing game

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Which is what I was talking about

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Well maybe it should have been

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Maybe they should have had Geometry Wars racing

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Blur was actually kind of like that

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
A little bit

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Shoot him up and the whole little like

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Art thing going on with it

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Honestly, when I saw Blur

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I couldn't get

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It wasn't very interesting to me

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
SplitSecond was more interesting to me

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
And, well, part of the problem with Blur

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Is that it came out like the same week

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
As SplitSecond

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
ModNation Racers

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
And, you know, while Mario Kart is still selling big

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
You know, and

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
It's just kind of unfortunate, but

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I don't know

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Does our creations really deserve to bite the bullet

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I don't know

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I think you hit the nail on the head

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
They were doing fine until Activision bought them

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Well, Activision, they're like

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Hey, you know, we need you to make some better stuff

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
So we're going to have you do a James Bond game

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Honestly

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I can't think of a James Bond game

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Since Goldeneye that has sold well

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
And those are the ones

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Normally based off movies

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
This was based off of nothing

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
So, their excuse was

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Well, you know, since there's a lawsuit

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Going on right now with the James Bond

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Licensing and stuff

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
So, hey, this is the closest thing

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
You're going to get to a new movie

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Well, that's great and all

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Except no one cares

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
And

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I don't know

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
It was just a terrible idea

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Another company

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Also taking some cuts

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Thanks to Activision is Budcat

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And Budcat

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Of course, they were

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
One of the developers that was acquired

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
To work on a Guitar Hero franchise

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And of course, it says

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Approximately 88 positions

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Or approximately 1%

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Of our global workforce has been

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Affected by the layoffs

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
So that's

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
1% is not bad, I guess

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
It says Budcat though

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Is comprised of roughly 60 people

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
So

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I don't know

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
It's interesting, I guess they were saying

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
They're doing

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
They're targeting

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Reduction in jobs

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
For its QA department

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I guess that makes sense

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Because, I mean, they hire

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
And fire people for QA all the time

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Based on

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
You know, the games that are coming out

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Although

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Some of those games

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Probably should keep the QA department

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Around a little bit longer

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Not necessarily just with Activision

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
But companies like Bethesda

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Might learn too

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
By keeping more QA around

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
You won't release buggy ass games

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Like Fallout New Vegas

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
And Activision, they're saying

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
We continue to streamline our music

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Development resources to ensure that

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
They are aligned against our slate

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
And strategic goals

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
As a result, we are implementing

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
A targeted reduction in jobs

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
In our QA team in California

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
And closing our Budcat studio

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
In Iowa

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Budcat has a great partner to Activision

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
And has created a lasting impact

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
On the Guitar Hero franchise

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Honestly, I think what this is coming around to

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Is that before they had

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
One team developing stuff

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
For Guitar Hero

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And then they acquired a few more studios

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
To do stuff for Guitar Hero

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And now that they're reducing the amount of games

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
They're releasing each year

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
From Metallica's, Van Halen's

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
And whatnot

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
They don't need that many development teams anymore

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Because they're going to be releasing

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
One Guitar Hero game a year

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Approximately

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I hate to say it because it's never happy news

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
To report on game studios closing

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
But unlike the last one, this one makes a little more sense

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
We know there's been too much saturation

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Of the Guitar Hero games

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
So to hear that one of the studios that's been making

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
All these unnecessary ports

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Sorry, that's how I feel

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
That shutting down makes more sense

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Than the last one you reported on

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Especially with the story we're going to get into here in a minute

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Which you know is not inevitable

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
About the music games kind of

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Slowing down as it is

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I don't know if they are slowing down

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I think

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
People have their expectations

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Wrong on some of these games

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But we'll get into that

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
A little bit later

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I just don't agree with

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
What they're saying

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
LucasArts, another company that's not Activision

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Is also confirming layoffs

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
And they're saying that they're

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Committing

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
To their internal development

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
And they're saying that recently

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
They've made minor adjustments in staffing

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
And that

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
It will help them better address

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
The needs of the business

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
And they're remaining

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
They remain committed to

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Their internal studio

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
And fostering relationships with trusted

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
internal partners in order to develop blah blah blah

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
In other words

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
They just let some people go

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Outsource

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
And of course

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
They had let go

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Some of their staff

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Earlier

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
This year as well

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Back in September

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I guess

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
This is

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I don't know if it's necessarily

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
To do with poor sales in different games

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Or whatnot but honestly

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
LucasArts doesn't have

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
A lot of games coming out each year

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
It's maybe one or two titles a year so

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I don't know

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It's kind of to be expected I guess

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Since they just finished a big title

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Yeah I guess

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Still kind of sucks but

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Okay

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
What's going to happen when they run out of Star Wars games to make?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I don't think they ever will

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
They never will

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Besides they have the huge MMO coming out

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Of Bioware but whatever

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And then finally

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
745 Studios

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
The company behind the

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Well the game

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
PowerGig

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
They also said that they are

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Linging off people

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Apparently

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Approximately 20 to 30 people were let go

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Most of which were in the QA team

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
And a bunch of full time staff

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
And of course

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
They're saying that

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
With the gig already on the store shelves

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Last week's 745 Studios restructured

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
The company is both a part of the

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Natural cycle in game development and the focus

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
On the development needs of its upcoming game projects

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Also the fact that

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Their games scored really poor

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Or really poorly

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
As far as reviews go

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Was not a good game unfortunately

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
And this is the studio

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Thanks to everyone who contributed to their first game

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
PowerGig Rise of the Sixth Stream

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
And we wish the individuals impacted by the reorganization

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
All the best

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
So yeah lots of people getting let going

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Right before the holidays

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I feel like this is like an echo of what happened last year

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
This is sad but I mean it's kind of a

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I guess it's to be expected

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
But it doesn't

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
These are the folks that bring our games

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Well I think it makes sense because if you think about it

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Maybe these games

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
For some of these smaller companies

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Not necessarily Activision and Bazaar

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
And stuff like that

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
It's like 745 I would think

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
That they're developing the game and stuff

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
They don't really need a large QA team until they're getting

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
The product all fleshed out

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
And then they're gonna hire people in

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And unfortunately QA

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
A lot of the testers and stuff

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
It's not as glamorous

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
As the tester would like you

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
To think

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
It's really just like

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Minimum wage

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Shit job that you take

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And you get hired and fired

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Pretty regularly

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
So it's not a big shock

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Yeah I mean I hate to say it

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
But especially when you consider

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
That Power Gig has come out now

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
And it's kind of landed with this big

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Unfortunately

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
It makes this news

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
A lot less surprising

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
But again

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
It is better than Rock Revolution

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah but a studio like Konami

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Can kind of take the blunt

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Of some of that

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Studio Closure's economy too

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I mean they closed one of their big offices

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I think two actually

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Well Hawaii had closed at one point

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
And then they had the Bay Area one closed

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
So I mean it's not like even the big companies are immune

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
To this sort of thing

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
But you know I don't like to report on people losing their jobs

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
As happy happy

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
But I think that the silver lining to this

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Is that you know

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
For I hate to sound like such a dork

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
But you know for every door that closes another opens

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
But especially in the gaming world

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
They will be on their way out

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Well I don't think, well we're going to get into that in a minute

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
But they're not what they were before

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Something new will come to take its place

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
You know we're not looking at another

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Huge video game crash

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Or there's going to be no jobs in gaming whatsoever

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I think there will be other opportunities

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
That just might not be the same type of game

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Or the same studio as before

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
So hopefully these guys land on their feet somewhere else

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You know what I mean

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Like there wouldn't have been a Power Gig in the first place

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
If Guitar Hero and Rock Band hadn't done so well, right?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah, so

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Anyhow, I guess I've referenced this enough

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
But you might have been reading some stories this week

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
It is being reported that music game sales

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Are continuing a downward trend

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
It's an analysis that was originally published by Gamasutra

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
They were looking at the period of January through October

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
For the past three years

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Looking at music game revenues

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
Apparently it was $1.6 billion in 2008

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
And where they are today, under $250 million for the year so far

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And they say short of a Christmas miracle

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
Music games won't break $400 million for all of 2010

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
So that would be what, a quarter of where they were in 2008?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
So

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
While that is kind of sad

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I also kind of go back and say

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Okay, well wait a minute

42:52.000 --> 42:58.000
2007 was the first year that Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 came out?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
So

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
To go January-October of 2008

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
That was the period when everybody was playing it over at their friends' houses

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
And all that

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Yeah, and

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I don't know, I mean

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
With Rock Band at least, they didn't have to sell software

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
They were selling download content

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Now I'm not really sure if that counts download content

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
As part of that revenue

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
But that's where all their money's been made lately

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
It's not been with new games

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
I mean, yeah, they just released a new game

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
But it's been out for maybe

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Not even a month yet

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Well, actually just slightly over a month

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
But

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I don't know, it's hard to say that

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It's dying

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
I think a lot of people are like

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Maybe they don't need the keyboard peripheral

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Maybe they're happy with the hundreds of songs

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
That they have in Rock Band 2

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Here's my thought though

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
And I'm gonna bring this full circle

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Watch

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
To say that music games are declining

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
And on their way out the door

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Is an extremely ignorant statement to me

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Because it's no different than

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Remember earlier in the show when you were speaking about

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Guwang

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
And you were saying it was like every other cave shooter

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
And somebody took issue with that

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
For me, it's very similar to what's happening here with music games

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I don't think the period of music games

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Means the period of plastic guitars

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
And plastic drums

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Is satiating

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
There's not anything else you can really do

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
With this

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I mean, Rock Band 3 is trying with the keyboards

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
And so forth, but it's unfortunately

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Not really gonna be enough

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
That doesn't mean music games are dead

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Look at Dance Central

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I can say pretty confidently

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
It's the best selling Kinect game right now

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
That isn't the one that's packaged in

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
With the Kinect

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Probably the two big ones

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Still though, to be doing that well

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Kinda shows that maybe there's a future there

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
And maybe other types of music games

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
That haven't quite been thought of yet

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Believe me guys, we've been following music games

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
For a very long time here on OLR

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Here's a perfect example

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Ten years ago it was DDR

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Before that, even Parappa the Rappa

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Busta

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Just all these other games

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Perfect example, what do you think the top Wii title was for October?

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
For October, the top Wii title?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Probably, it's still Wii Play

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
No

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And you would think, maybe it might be Kirby's

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
You know, the

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Epic Yarn or whatever

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
It's gonna be something a lot more

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Like every

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Adult picks it up for the family

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It's gonna be something family

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
It's a Wii Party

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Just Dance 2

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Okay

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Not too surprised, okay

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
And not even close for second place

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Just Dance 2

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
For the month of October

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
And this is since it was released

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Cause I believe it came out the second or third week

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Of October

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
It sold 285,556 units

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Compare that with second place

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Which would've been

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Wii Fit Plus

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
With Balance Board

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Cause you know those games

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
You know, Ten to Sell

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
And Wii Party of course

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Wii Fit Plus 89,000

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
So it

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Oversold it by more than double

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
And same with

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Wii Party

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
It was 92,000

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
So

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
You know

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
You can't really see that the music genre is dead

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Because these games are just doing

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Crazy well

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Just Dance, the first one

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Number 8 for October

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
And it sold actually

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I just wanna say real quick

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
To be fair in the Gamasutra

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
And I'm not interrupting you, I promise

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
To be fair in the original Gamasutra report

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
They are acknowledging that Dance Central

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Could be a new opportunity for where this is going

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
But nowhere in this report does it mention

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Just Dance

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
It should, and here's another cool fact

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
You know

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Games like Wii Fit

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
And stuff like that

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Sold a lot

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Four million copies

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
From launch to date

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Some other stuff

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Real quick, I'm trying to find another game that would have been

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Like a real big one here

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Let's see here

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Okay, here we go

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Metroid Other M

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
You know, I guess that's kind of a poor comparison

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Because it didn't do well all the way

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Well yeah, Reggie acknowledged it's not

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
187,000 life

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
From launch

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Okay, here we go, here we go

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
How about like a Mario Party 8

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
See that did 3.2 million

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Launch to date

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
And you know

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
The

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Just Dance series, the first one

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Did actually

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Pretty well, I mean within a year

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
It has sold almost 2 million units

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
1.8 million units

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
In closing, and here's kind of my closing thought

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
With this, this whole report here

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Does not really sound like

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
A referendum on music games

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
So much as it is a referendum on

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Harmonics, and maybe trying to make sense

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Of why Viacom suddenly wants to

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Unload them, because

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Even though it's talking about Guitar Hero and Rock Band

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I'm sorry, Guitar Hero was still a

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Harmonics franchise

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Yes, it's been turned over to somebody else since then

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
But Harmonics made that first game

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
That everything else has been modeled after

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Everything that's happened

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
In the Guitar Hero franchise has been a rip-off

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Of something Harmonics has done

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Since Harmonics left the building, right?

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Is that really an unfair thing to say?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
No

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
So this is more speaking to, in my opinion

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Harmonics

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Than it is music games

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Because nowhere in here are we talking about

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
The Just Dances of the World or the

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
You know, Konami, DDR

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Which I'm sure is really nothing to scream about

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
But it's still out there cooking

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And it's poking along

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Unfortunately, that is the future of Rock Band

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
It's going to be like the

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
DDR releases

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
It's going to have its loyal following forever and ever

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
And it will still get its yearly releases

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
But they're going to, unfortunately, probably

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Be a little more and more meh

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
But here's the thing, I think Harmonics

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Is a studio that knows better

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
And will continue to innovate and such

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Like they're trying to do with Dance Central

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Which, you know, it seems to be working out

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Well for them, and who knows whatever else

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
They're going to bring out in the future

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Maybe something else connect, maybe that whole

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Rumored revival of the amplitude frequency

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Style game, who knows

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Anyhow

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Maybe I've spoken too long on this, I don't know

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
But if you want to join us in our chatroom

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Some folks talking about Dance Masters

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
And maybe arcade games

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Saying, so if Konami could get with them

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
To put out Dance Masters, they could put it in arcades

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Oh, Izzam says

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Music games aren't out the door

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
They're just not the cash cow everyone wanted them to be

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
They were for a while

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
You know, I could see, see that's

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
One thing that's kind of cool about the Kinect

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
And the way it's set up, is

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
An arcade release wouldn't be that

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Difficult for them

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I mean seriously, since there's no controller involved

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
You just use the same damn technology

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
And away you go

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Nothing like this lasts forever

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Any type of fad in gaming

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Or really anything it is

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Movies even, nothing like this lasts forever

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Like, remember teen comedies

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
When American Pie came out

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
We had every teen

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Comedy in the world came out

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Over the next couple years

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
And then suddenly, they didn't all start doing well

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
It doesn't mean teen comedies are gone forever

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
But it's just you don't see as many of them

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Right? Or if they did come out

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
They're not the gross out

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Stuff like American Pie was

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
People, they try to

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
You know, they try to figure out what the trends are

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
There's certain companies that will

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Create those trends

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
And then there's other companies that will try to mimic

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Those trends

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
And try to capitalize on them

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
And some of them do a good job of it

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Like for example, when Activision

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
When Guitar Hero first came out

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
That was a good franchise

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And then you had EA come out with

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Rockband, of course both developed by the same company

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
But it kind of

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
You know, was taking

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Some of the thunder from

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Guitar Hero, but then improved upon it

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
It's hard though right now

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Because it's hard to improve upon

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
What they've already got

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
With what's out there as far as

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
The peripherals go

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
And really, how much more can you do

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Other than adding new instruments

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
To make these games any more

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Unique or exciting or whatever

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I mean, other than the song list

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I guess in peripherals, it would just be

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
There's not much you can do with it

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
It hasn't been thought of yet

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Who knew three years ago

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
We would be looking at a game like Dance Central

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
I don't think any of us could have predicted that

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Um

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Especially with the iToy stuff

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
It just didn't work well

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
It just didn't work well before

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
And I think a lot of us wrote it off then

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
As the trend that was going to go away

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
You know what I mean?

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Oh, we saw this done on the iToy

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
And it was kind of ridiculous at best

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
So, bye

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
So who knew that the technology would be there later on

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
You know, perfect example of people trying to capitalize on this stuff

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
They have

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
It's funny

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
They actually have another dance game

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
For the Kinect that we haven't really heard of

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Because it's only in the European markets

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Dance Paradise

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Yeah, I remember a story on this one had come up briefly

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Didn't look very good

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Kind of similar to

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
It reminds me a little bit of Dance Masters

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
But like, really dumbed down

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Because it has all your

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Avatar characters dancing around

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Well, and you, me, and her can't exactly run over to Target

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
And get a copy of that

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Exactly

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
And then the other thing too

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Is the star plus dance

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Something else that they're trying to capitalize on

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
The whole Just Dance and Dance Central stuff

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
But it's just not done well

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
And the problem is you're going to get a lot of these companies

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Especially if Dance Central does really, really well

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
They're going to release their dance games

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
They're just going to be

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Probably terrible

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
I bet you anything

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Dance Central does really well

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Well, we've already got the trademark for Dance Hero

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
How much you want to bet?

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Alright, I want to say this real quick comment

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
From our good pal Bobby Blackwolf

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Is in the chat

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I want the inevitable Glee ripoff

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Based on a marching band

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Someone make this trend happen

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
That is one trend I'm not looking forward to

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Is all the Glee ripoffs coming next season

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
By the way, because you know

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
The Glee game, Karaoke Revolution

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
I mentioned that there was a sequel on the way

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
V2

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Road to, what was it?

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Road to Regionals is the

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
The name

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Will it have Teenage Dream in it?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Can't wait

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Yay, now I know what to buy Dark Sakura

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
For Christmas, except she'll throw it at me

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Or Hanukkah, excuse me

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Chrismica

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
If I bought you Glee the video game on Wii

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
How quick would I be wearing the box?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I don't know

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I'd have to actually get Becky over here to play it

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I wouldn't play it

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
But she loves Glee, so I would let her play it

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
And then I would go

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Trade it in and get a good game

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
But see, that's what Karaoke Revolution

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Has become to

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Konami

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I don't think they take it seriously anymore

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Well, I'm gonna get more attention to this

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I know, let's attach

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Glee to it

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I know, let's attach American Idol

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
To it

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
How long

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
I can tell you how long

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
It's because once that show actually launches

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
How long are we gonna have Karaoke Revolution

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
X Factor edition

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I mean, seriously

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
That's gonna be the next thing they have

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Alright

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Let's move on, we gotta talk about something

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Not music games, so hopefully Dark Sakura

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Can help us out, do you have a non-music game story for us?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Remember that thing that we

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Were wondering if ever would come out

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
And it looks like it finally is, and maybe people

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Care? Duke Nukem Forever?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Gran Turismo 5

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Well, actually

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
It's gonna have a feature where you don't

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Have to load the whole thing onto your

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Hard drive, which is actually supposed to take

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
About 40 minutes to do

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Wow

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Yeah, it needs 6.4 gigabytes

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Of hard drive space

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Um

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
But what you can do is you can actually just

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Opt not to and let stuff

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Load as it will, but what it does

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
As it loads is that it loads

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
What you're playing

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Onto your hard drive, so you're

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Installing it in fragments

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
So it's

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Copying over what you need

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
For that particular race

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Exactly, and of course

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
You know, say that you do new content

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Well, you've got

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
That going on, and then say you go back

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
To an old race, well it's already there, you don't have to worry about waiting

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
For it to really load

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Because it'll be going off hard drive

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Interesting, and I wonder if it, does it use any

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Idle times? I don't know if this is even out there

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Or not, like while you're on menus and stuff

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Maybe to be doing some of the loading as well?

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Um, sure it will be

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Interesting

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
But the number of cars is listed on here

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
As 1031 cars

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And that's pretty crazy

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
That's a lot of cars

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Yeah

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
It's actually the largest install

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
That's gonna be on PS3

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I mean, other big ones were

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Devil May Cry

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
And Endwar

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
And Bioshock 2 and Lost Planet

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
They were around the five gig

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Four and a half, five gig range

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
And this is 6.4

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
So it's big

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
And for our European listeners it will be out

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
On November 24th

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
That's an eventual

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
That's also for us, yeah

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
The worldwide launch thing

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
I was confirming

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Men

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Are you gonna pick it up?

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Is it a game that interests you?

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Probably, though I won't, Dan will get it

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Okay

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
He's the one who sits here and waits for

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
All the new episodes of Top Gear to come out so he can

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Watch them on the internet

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
So, oh give me that

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I'm trying to open this new little

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Toy I bought, sorry

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Dark Soccer is using her nails

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Maybe, maybe scissors?

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
I don't know, alright, anyhow, let's move on

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
More news, nobody wants to hear about my package

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Opening drama, except for the fact, why do they

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Make packages so difficult to open?

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
So people can't steal. Loss prevention

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Still

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And because they're so fragile

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Just have the cameras and the beepers

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Yeah, of course that never works either, the beepers

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Always go off even when I legitimately

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Bought them

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Just to let everyone know I'm using the scissors

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I stole from work

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
From the place of which I am officially

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
No longer employed

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Way to stick it to them

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Oh yeah, I'll take some scissors

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Sure

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
So we were talking a little bit about the

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Connect and Dance Central and stuff

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Well Connect has actually sold pretty well

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
It's already moved a million units in the first ten days

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
And they're saying it's on track to hit their goal

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Of five million this year

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
I have a little problem with that

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Because

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
GameStop and

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Me personally

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Based off of what I've seen coming from Microsoft

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
They're saying there's shortages

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Of this

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
You know, Connect hardware

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
So I'd be surprised

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
If they hit five million by the end of this year

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Because what we see coming

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Is definitely not

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
You know, a lot

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Is it really shortage time?

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Because when I was at Best Buy the other day, they had plenty

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Well that's what GameStop's saying

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
They're saying it's hard to get

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
And I think that you're gonna see

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
It may be hard to find right now

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Because they're holding them back for Black Friday

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
I don't know

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I just know that there's a lot of them

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
On eBay going over retail

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
But people are crazy

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
And of course they're gonna say

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Oh yeah, it's hard to get

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
But you know

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
It's gonna be one of the must have things

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Definitely this holiday

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
So

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
You know, if you're interested in buying one

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
And especially if you're looking

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
To put it under the Christmas tree

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Or in a stocking

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Or whether festive

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Kind of a big thing to put in a stocking

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
That's a really big sock

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Really big stockings

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
If it's something

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
You're looking to purchase

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
For Christmas or a holiday or whatever

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Give as a gift

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
You probably want to start looking now

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Don't wait till the last minute

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Alright

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Well if they don't meet their numbers because of shortages

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Then that's their own damn fault

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
How can you predict that you're gonna sell five million

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Yet know at the same time you're not gonna make that many

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
They said three to five was their original expense

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Now we're downplaying it a little bit

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Alright

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
We'll see

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I don't think they're going to

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Here's the real message on everyone's mind

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
How's this doing compared to the move?

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I don't know

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
I know Sony put out something and said

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Oh yeah the move's done well

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Fortunately the NPD and stuff

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
They don't really track

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Accessory sales

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Which is what this would be kind of considered

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I guess

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
So I don't know

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Maybe we'll find out in a future episode

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Alright well moving on to some news

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
About Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
We have a release date for the game

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
So I know this is something

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Dark Sakura's gonna pick up

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Or make Dan get for her

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
What a perfect opportunity

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Dark Sakura just in time for Valentine's Day

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Actually a little bit late

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
February 15th, 2011

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So if you're willing to put Valentine's Day on hold

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
By one day you can make it of

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Marvel meets Capcom and falls in love day

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
You know what?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
We typically play games on Valentine's Day

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
So he can get me that

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Instead of a bunch of roses

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I don't care

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
At least he won't bitch about how much this costs

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Instead of the roses

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Just dip the box in chocolate

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Yes to be fair this game would probably be cheaper than the roses

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
You know I always tell him that I want one

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And he buys me a dozen

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And I'm like, dude I want one

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Maybe he thinks you mean one dozen

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Maybe one doesn't

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Alright the game is coming out

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
It's gonna be out on February 15th, 2011

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
On the 360 and the Playstation 3

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Europe you have to wait just a few more days

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
So you might have to make it Valentine's week

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
February 18th is the day for you guys

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
There is a regular and special edition

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And the special edition will cost you

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
70 bucks

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Now in the news of more characters

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
There are some more characters announced for the game

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
She-Hulk and Zero

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I love She-Hulk, she's so awesome

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
She-Hulk is female Hulk

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And Zero of course is from the Mega Man franchise

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I wonder if she's also gonna

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Break the fourth wall since they're letting Deadpool do it

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Why not?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Well she does it in her own comic too

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I don't see why they wouldn't

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Be a good thing to do there

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
So those characters are coming out

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I believe I was reading something about

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
They're the special edition characters too

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
So if you want all the characters

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
You gotta shout out the extra money

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Oh no, I take that back

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Jill Valentine is one of the special characters

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And Shumagrath

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I have to tell you

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
We always call Shumagrath Shumachan

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Because apparently Shumagrath is supposed to be

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Female but also a really bad tentacle rate monster

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Seriously, Shumagrath

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Is this giant eyeball with a bunch of tentacles

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Alright

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I was gonna say

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Maybe a boss monster, but I guess it's not

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Shumagrath was also in

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Kinda like Medusa on crack

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
It was in

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Marvel Superheroes vs Street Fighter

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
So there you go

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
In the special edition we'll also

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Get you exclusive

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Artwork, a steel book case

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
A one month

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Subscription to Marvel's online digital

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Comic service, that's kinda interesting

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And a prologue comic that will be 12

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Pages that will explain

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Why there's a contest between these two

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Universes, so they're gonna retcon this whole

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Thing in which I'm sure will also be explained in the

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Intro

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
But comics are different

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So there you go

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Remember, that comic will probably be

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Scanned and put online immediately

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm actually dying to know from Dark

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Sakura since this is kinda part of the world she lives

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
In, how do you feel about the digital comic

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Being a pack

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
In? I mean, do digital comics cut it

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
For you, or no thank you, I want

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Books? Well

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Given that I read a lot of my comics

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Digitally anyway, it's just fine by me

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Um, actually

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Tiara and I share a

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Subscription to Marvel digital comics

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Oh, very cool

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Yeah, so

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It's mostly old comics

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And a lot of them actually do have in print

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
But it's still pretty cool

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And I've always

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Did it say that

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
It was just a digital comic or one of the

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Motion

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Comics? It's the

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Subscription to their digital comic service

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
But I mean, they say that they were

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
That they were gonna release another

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Comic

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I think the actual comic book that comes with it

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
The prologue comic is a physical comic book

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Oh, see, that I want

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Oh, nevermind, I misunderstood, I thought

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Okay, so you have a digital comic and a

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It's MODOK! Sorry

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I was looking back at the video and I was like

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Ah, MODOK

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
It's gonna be a fun fighting game, looking forward to it

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I'm looking forward to it, and you know what, I love the little touches

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Because I've been going back and watching movies

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
With characters, just to check

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Authenticity

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And there's been some pretty neat little touches in there

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Now Marvel, I'm really happy for you

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And I'm gonna let you finish

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
But Capcom vs. SNK

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Was the best crossover fighting game of all time

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
So I'm looking forward to maybe that being next year

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Just saying

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
More news stories

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And then release dates coming up in just one moment

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Dark Sakura

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Well, in other news, we have

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
A bit of a cost

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Issue with development on the 3DS

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
It's going

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
To be expensive

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
As in, probably three times

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
As expensive

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
As doing other

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
DS, as doing DS games

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
One times expensive for every dimension

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Yeah

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
They're basically saying between

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
50 million and 150 million yen

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Per

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
3DS title

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
So, um

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
That's a lot of money

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
It's going to

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Pretty much, like, here's

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
An example

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Gaming

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Actually reported that

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Japanese studios spend between 4.4 million

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And 43.9 million on a DS title

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And we're talking

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
50 million

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
To 150 million yen

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Yikes

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
That's a lot of money

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Yeah, and just to put that

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Into perspective

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
At least for our UK listeners

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
They're spending roughly 33,000

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
To 333,000 pounds

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And then

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
The estimated cost

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Is going to be

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
A lot

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
A lot

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Well, now, there's a part of me that wants to say, well, duh

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
You know, new system, new expenses

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
DS has been out a while

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
So, of course, it's cheap, and this is going to be new

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
But

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
There was a call

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Especially when E3 was around

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
That they were saying, it's going to be easy to develop for

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Because it's just like

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Developing for other Nintendo platforms

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Ease and cost are two different things

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I guess that's true, but

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
They were saying, like, if your game at all

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Is calculating a type of Z-axis

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
To render 3D in a 2D

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
TV, if you know what I mean

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
It's very easy to translate that into the 3DS

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And remember, they were showing those demos

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Of the 8-bit games

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
That, you know, were redone

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And not just 8-bit, but they had the Zelda

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
All Green of Time was out there

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And Star Fox was out there

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I would imagine that they wouldn't be too difficult

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
To develop that kind of stuff because all they have to

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Really do is create a second virtual camera

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
That's going to be, you know, one for each eye

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And that's how you create your depth

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
For rendering purposes, but

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I don't know

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So I'm surprised to hear it's three

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Times as much money

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I mean, okay, a little bit more expensive

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Perhaps that will

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Stave off some of the

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Shovelware that may appear on

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
That platform

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
That might be a nice side effect, but I sadly don't think

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
You're right

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
It's only a matter of time before those development

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Costs come down, right?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
So

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Well, as technology

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Catches up with it too, I think

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
But this is still

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Mostly speculation, I think

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
You know, once they actually get practical

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Costs out of it, once it's in motion

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Then we'll be looking at something a little different

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Alright, well, we'll see

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
We'll see if these, uh, spending

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
The money was worth the effort in just a few months

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I can't believe I'm saying, a few months?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
3DS is out for us all to

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Consume. Alright, in the meantime, let's see

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
What's coming out a little more

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Sooner for us to consume

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
That was the worst transition ever

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Good one, you know we're going to have huge mungus

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Lists

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Anyhow, what's coming out of the

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
US? Black Friday is right around the corner

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Can't wait to see what Steam is selling

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
On Black Friday. I was just telling Dan that earlier

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Hey, apparently the whole

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Game for Windows thing, 10 cents

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
For Age of Empires 3 today, and I'm sure

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
That's been everywhere, yeah

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
But, it's Age of Empires 3

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I have 0 cents interest in that game

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I mean, I think it's great that there's bargain basement

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
But the game's like 5 years old

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
No one cares anymore

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Now that it's 10 cents, people do

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Like, I could get a game for 10 cents

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
It's 5 years old

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It wasn't selling any copies anyway

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Anyhow

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Today, actually, marked the release

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Of Raving Rabbids Travel in Time

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
For the Nintendo Wii, as well as

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Donkey Kong Country Returns, which I hear

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Is pretty good

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
That is also on the Wii

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
This week, not a whole lot coming out, but some

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Pretty cool stuff

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Red Dead Redemption, the Undead Nightmare Collection

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
On Xbox 360 and Playstation 3

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
That is the Undead Nightmare expansion

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Which brings a brand new single player

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Campaign, as well as

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
All the multiplayer

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Expansions

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
This can actually be played by itself

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
So you don't need the original Red Dead

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So if you're looking to play some online Red Dead Redemption

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And you want to do it cheaper

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
This is the way to go, because it's only 30 bucks

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Hot Wheels

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Track Attack on the Wii and DS

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Actually kind of cool because you can

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Build your own tracks with this one

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And they have the 80's

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Hot Wheel Orange Tracks

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
With it, so you gotta love that

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
This week also, the Rock Band 3 Pro Wireless Guitar

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Is making its way out for 150 bucks

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
That's on Playstation 3 and

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
360

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Silly Bands

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
A game based off of Robert Vance

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Awesome

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
That's on Nintendo DS

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Where all the shovelware lives

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Challenge Me Brain Puzzles 2

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
On Nintendo DS

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
That looks terrible as well

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Some re-releases

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Looks like it's kind of capitalizing

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Black Friday stuff

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
They're re-releasing Enemy Territory

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Quake Wars and Soul Calibur 4

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
This is by a third party company

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Which is why none of those are from the same

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Publisher

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
That's for 30 bucks

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I think there's some more coming out later this week as well

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Splatterhouse

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
This week

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Include the original Splatterhouse game as well

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
As kind of an unlockable bonus

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
CSI Unsolved on Nintendo DS

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Majin

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And the Forsaken Kingdom on

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Rapala Fishing

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
That's for 30 bucks as well

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Monster Jam

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Path of Destruction for Playstation 3

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
This is a bundle that comes with a stupid wheel

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
To your DualShock 3 controller

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Great

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Worms Battle Island for Nintendo Wii

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Another re-release pack

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Brutal Legends and Splinter Cell

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Double Agent

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Man, some of these games are dirt cheap

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I'm not sure if you're getting a great deal on this

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
But that's on Xbox 360

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Drawn to Life Collection

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
A re-release of those two games

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
That's on Nintendo DS

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
To tie in with the new Disney movie

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Disney's Tangled

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
On DS and Wii

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Pro Evolution Soccer 2011

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
On the Wii

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And it looks like they're doing

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
A Sonic the Hedgehog

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Re-release pack

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Sega All-Stars Racing and Sonic Unleashed

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That's for 35 bucks

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
And also Brutal Legends and

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Timeshift, those are on Playstation 3

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Pack, that's 35 dollars

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And some actual new stuff

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Michael Jackson, The Experience

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Nintendo Wii, that does include a

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Jewel-encrusted white glove

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Just to complete the experience

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Which I really want

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Loki to wear to an episode of the show

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Caution, rhinestones

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Cupid Zirconia

Coming out this week, both

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
The standard and the limited edition

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And that

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Wraps up the week, of course it's kind of

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Gonna be slowing down

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Here quite a bit, so don't expect much

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Coming soon

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Alright, well we'll travel over to Japan and look at

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
What's coming out of there, on the 360

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Dudampachi Resurrection

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Comes out in regular and limited edition

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
This is from Cave, so you know

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Where this is going, right Loki?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It's a shooter game, but this is a

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
You know, it's kind of like made for the 360

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
So it's very purdy

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Kind of looking at the graphics here

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
So check that out, that is on the 360 this week

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And that really is the big release in

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Japan this week on the 360

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
There is Shaun White skateboarding

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
But no one curr

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Alright, moving on to the PlayStation 3

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
This week, Gran Turismo 5

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Not only coming out here, but in Japan as well

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So check that out if you like that stuff

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Also, Pachipata 16

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Gengita Paradise 2

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Comes out this week

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
From Irem

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
And yeah, it's just pretty much

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Chicks on the beach playing pachinko games

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
That is literally what this game is

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
But they're all like 3D rendered and shit

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Look at this 3D rendering of pachinko machines

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It almost looks like a

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Make your own pin

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Type of mode, where you can put the pins wherever you want

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I'm telling you, it's a big deal there

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
There also is a

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
PlayStation 3 bundle

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
With the console coming out

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
With the Gran Turismo bundled in

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Because it's kind of a big deal in Japan

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
So look for that this week

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Shaun White skateboarding as well, big deal

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Trinity Zero comes out this week

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
That's also a PlayStation 3 game

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
That's coming from Koei

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
And this is like a swords and magic type of game

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Kind of looks like you have a party of people

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
But it looks to be a little bit more of like a

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Action-y type of

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Roleplaying game

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So that actually looks kind of rad

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Is this coming out in the US as well?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Not this year, probably next year

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
That might be one that you want to import

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
For those of you that are big into importing

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
But just be careful

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It's a lot of Japanese

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
So if you don't know Japanese

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
You might be screwed

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Also gets a price reduction

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I don't think these are all

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Games that you guys are going to be pre-ordering

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I'm not

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Let's go to Europe

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Well actually there are quite a number of games

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000

Well that's the PlayStation 3 one

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And actually there is a release on

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
The 25th

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Of course it's not a holiday for them there I think

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Plus Island Freedom

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
26th is Def Jam Rapstar

Tron Evolution which I'm looking forward to

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
So getting that

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
There's a bunch more

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
There's also Venetica

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And on the 30th

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Super Meat Boy

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Yeah Venetica is supposed to be coming over here in January

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
So that should be cool

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You played the Daughter of the Devil

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Yeah that actually looks pretty interesting

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Because apparently

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Death is real or not the Devil

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Death

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
The Daughter of Death

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Close enough

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Both begin with D

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
That looks kind of interesting

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Jimmy

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Eh

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
It does kind of have a bit of a

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Fable vibe to it just in looks

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Yeah

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Cool

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
That's it

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
APB

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
It's kind of funny because people were pissed off

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
That this game actually kind of went under

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Within about 3 months of its launch

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And now it's been acquired by

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Gamers First and they're relaunching

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
As APB Reloaded

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
In the first half of 2011

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And what's kind of cool about it though

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Is the game will actually be

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
A free to play

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Iteration of the game

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
So lots of microtransactions

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
As well but hey you know what

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
That's awesome because

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I would love that game to be free to play

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
It was pretty fun to begin with

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
But I couldn't see myself paying for it

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Thank God I was too lazy to pay for it

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
This was a game that you were excited about

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
But you were like too lazy to get

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Right?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Exactly

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Nice

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Or as Rama says in our chat room

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
APB rise from your grave

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Get it?

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Anyhow one more story

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
For you guys and we're going to get to the classic game of the week

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
But this is about a different type of classic

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
On the Wii

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
It's this whole super special

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
25th anniversary edition here

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
You know the Wii has

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
The 25th anniversary Mario collection

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
That comes with like a Mario collection

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And Wii Sports

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And the red controllers and all that

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Here's the interesting thing though

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Is that in Europe they got the Wii

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And it came with New Super Mario Brothers

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And Donkey Kong original

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Edition

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It was preloaded onto the Wii

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
It was kind of like a virtual console game

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Because you know how Donkey Kong was on the NES

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Originally right?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Well here's the interesting thing

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Donkey Kong original edition

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
On the Wii that's coming out in Europe

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Has the cement factory level

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And you might be going

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Okay well who cares about that?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Well that's because the cement factory level

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Wasn't in the NES version of

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Donkey Kong

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
So it's kind of weird because

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It's very obvious I guess you can tell

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
From the way this kind of looks when you're playing the game

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
That it's not a port of the arcade game

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
But it's actually like an NES ROM

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
But it actually has the

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Cement factory level in it

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Which by the way I used to call the pie level

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Because I'm the Commodore 64

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
That for whatever reason

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Are going into burning oil

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Just roll with me here

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So yeah kind of weird that

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Nintendo either knowingly or unknowingly

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Kind of dug out this prototype

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Donkey Kong game

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
That honestly never saw the light of day

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
In either continent

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I think that's kind of cool actually

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I mean whereas a lot of people are going to look at this

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And go eh big deal a missing level shows up

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
In a game that's like what 25 years old now

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I kind of go wait a minute though

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Nintendo has this kind of shit in the vaults

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And they're capable of putting it on

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
A service like virtual console

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Why aren't they?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Like yeah we got

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Some of these what Japanese

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Games that never came out here in America

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Or Europe or whatever the case may be

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
And like Sin and Punishment right

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
That was a big thing they did a couple years ago or last year

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
How about some of these

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Unreleased Nintendo games that never saw

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
The light of day

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Or here's something kind of interesting

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Seeing as you know

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
They have the 25th anniversary edition

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And the Super Mario All-Stars

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Limited edition stuff coming out

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Which by the way

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Is just a port of the Super Nintendo game

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Why couldn't they have ported over

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I don't know the Super Nintendo

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Cartridge that had both Super Mario World

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And Super Mario All-Stars

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
You know a little bit extra to go in there

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Seeing as you have a whole fucking disc

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
That you could pack full of stuff

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Why would they do that

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
When they could just put in an ad

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
To go onto the virtual console marketplace

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And spend 800 Wii Points

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
On that game

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Why would they give you something for free Loki

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
You just want something for nothing

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
You want grateful kids

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
What they had for the game

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
They had the pre-order discs

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Remember that you could get the two

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Nintendo 64 Zelda games

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And the two 8-Bit Zelda games

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I don't understand why they can't

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Oh I know because like you said

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
They're selling them on the virtual console

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
That's right

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Rama in our chat room says it could be an unlock lol

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I doubt it

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
By the way there is this

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
25th anniversary Super Mario

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Brothers thing that they did

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
All they did they like changed the copyright

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Date and they just kind of

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Edited the question mark blocks to say

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
25

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Basically it's a ROM hack

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It's on that same level as

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Super Penis Brothers

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Where somebody took all the pictures of Mario

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
And turned them into penises

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Which is freely available on the internet

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
So that's the business Nintendo is in now

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Speaking of ROM hacks

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I don't think we talked about it last week

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
New Super Mario Brothers

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Someone ROM hacked the

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
DS ROM and made it

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
New Super Mario Brothers

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I remember that coming up last week

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
That's sweet

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
See that's what you do

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Because Mario All Stars

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
That's great that you made everything 16 bit

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
And stuff why don't you just

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Update it again

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Make it all like New Super Mario Brothers

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
So you have all the original levels

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
With Mario Brothers, the lost levels

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Mario 2 and stuff like that

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Make it all brand new

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And guess what you could have sold it for

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
$50 instead of $30

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Here's the thing

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Because basically you're buying a $30 ROM

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Or if they were going to do a ROM hack

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
With this 25th anniversary

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
They could have done a good ROM hack

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
You know some of the ones out there

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
They took the graphics from Mario 3

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
When Mario looked a lot sharper

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And the sprites were kind of better

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And put it in Mario 1

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
They should have done something like that

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Or maybe they went back and redone the sprites

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
I'm not just talking about that

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I'm talking about a ROM hack out there

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
That takes the Mario 3 sprites

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
And puts them in the Mario 1 game

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
This is just a little extra thing

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
For itself

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Oh it's an extra bonus for buying the actual console

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
It's this 25th anniversary edition

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Of Mario Bros

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Which by the way the ROM will probably be floating around out there

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
As if it really needs to be

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Because it's just a simple ROM hack

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
But

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I don't know

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
It's just

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
It's neat I guess

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
But it's not that unique

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Alright well it's a bummer

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
It's probably never going to go anywhere past this

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Wow that's kind of cool

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I'm telling you somebody just grabbed the wrong damn file

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Is probably what happened

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
With this whole prototype getting released

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Somebody grabbed the wrong damn file

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
And didn't even know what they were doing

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Alright anyhow let's get into

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Speaking of classic stuff

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I know we're talking about Donkey Kong

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
But I think Dark Soccer wants to take a trip down memory lane

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And point out a different game

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
She says hey

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Listen up kids

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Grateful brats that don't know what a pie factory is

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
There's a game out there

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
That you should be checking out and playing

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And showing a little love this week

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Although I gotta say I think a lot of the kids

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Know about this one but if they forgot

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
It's time they remember

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I think that we should actually start this one off with the music

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I think we should too so let me pull up the music

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
If they don't get it then

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Yes the game of the week is

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Bubble Bobble

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Which I could have sworn I've done before

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
But I don't think I did so here it is

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Bubble Bobble was put out by Taito

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It came out in 1986

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And came out on Damn Near Everything

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
There are bubble dragons named Bub and Bob

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Or as they were in Japan

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
There was Babarune

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
And Babarune

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
And Babarune

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
And Babarune

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And Babarune

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And Babarune

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And Babarune

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So same diff

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
And basically they spit out bubbles

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And push them around

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
And smack their enemies

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
And there's been many

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Many many games in their series

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
So yeah basically

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
You blow the bubbles

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
You can trap the enemies in the bubbles

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And you can push them to

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Burst the bubbles

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
And make the enemies fall off

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And the enemies

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
The bubbles with the enemies and it can float

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
So you can jump on them all

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Use them to get to hard to reach places

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Or pop many of them at a time

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
But if they're

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
If they're the last one left on the screen

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
They get angry

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And change color

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And then you have to bop them

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And they're harder to get

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Some of them have rocks, lasers, fireballs

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
For projectiles

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
But sometimes you have

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Different things like water

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And lightning

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Little balls that you can smack them around with

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
As far

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
As ports there have been a

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Bajillion like I said

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And that's the technical term for it

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
There's been Commodore 64

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Sinclair ZX Spectrum

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Amiga Atari ST MSX

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Armstrad CPC

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Sharp X68000

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
PC there was a

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
DOS one in

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
1989 and in 1996

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
There was I think another one

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Apple II

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
FM Towns Marty Sega Master System

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Game Boy Game Boy Color Game Boy

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Advanced Nintendo DS

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
PlayStation Sega Saturn

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
NES Famicom Disc

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Game Gear Mobile Phone

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
TI 80 whatever calculators

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And it came out

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
On the Ultra K Taito arcade classics

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
There's also one for the BBC

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Micro that

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Never actually got released

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Taito said in

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
1996 that they lost the

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Original source code

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And um

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Probe

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Was actually

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Sent that so that they

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Could reproduce the mechanics

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
And that also meant that later on

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Uh

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
There were re-releases of

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Rainbow Islands for Saturn, PlayStation

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And PC in 1996

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
The Game Boy

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Game Boy Color versions have a water moon

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Storyline and it's known as

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Bubble Bobble in classic Bubble Bobble

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
And there's a

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Like I said there was one for the TI-83

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Graphing calculator that someone made which I

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Think I had

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
At one time till my graphing calculator

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Died um there was

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Uh Xbox PS2

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
PC for the Taito Legends

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Compilation um

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
It was on mobile phones in Europe and Japan

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And then it came out

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
On the Virtual Console

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
There were also broken versions later on

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Like uh ones that wouldn't let you get past

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Level 30

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Yes seriously

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
As far as other games that came

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Out in the series

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Let's move on to those we have

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Rainbow Islands the Bubble

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
The story of Bubble Bobble 2

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
We have Rainbow Islands extra versions

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Parasol Stars which originally came out

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
On the PC Engine and I know where you can get a copy

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
In town and they want 70 bucks for it

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
And I'm like no!

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Which by the way if it feels like you've done this game before

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
It's because you did Parasol Stars

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I did do Parasol Stars

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Parasol Stars is a great game

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
And there's also Bubble Bobble Part 2

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Bubble Bobble 2 slash Bubble Symphony

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Um Bubble Memories the story of

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Bubble Bobble 3

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Rainbow Islands Putty's Party

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Which was on the Wonderswan and I think

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I have it I have to check

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I've got some Wonderswan games I don't remember what I have

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And Bubble Bobble Plus which is a WiiWare game

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
And also Bubble Bobble Neo

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Is the same version that came out on

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Xbox Live Arcade

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And that is Bubble Bobble

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Okay yeah there's

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
There are quite a number

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
And don't forget about the related

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Ones in the series

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
There was Puzzle Bobble

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Which was over here Bust a Move

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Mhmm

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Which is a really dumb name

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
For the game

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
There was Azumanga Puzzle Daioh

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
After the Azumanga Daioh

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Which is also in the series

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
So

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Puzzle de Pon, Fairyland Story

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
And Check and Pop

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Similar

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Your classic game of the week boys and girls

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Bubble Bobble on like every system ever made

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
But is there

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
A certain system that you prefer above

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
All others

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I would say original arcade

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
But that's

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Yeah well I can tell you what

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
What my favorite in the

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Series was and what system I played it on

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Was Puzzle Bobble 2 on Saturn

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I played a crap ton

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Of Puzzle Bobble 2 on the Saturn

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Seriously

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I would just sit on the floor in front of Danzel TV

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
And just do nothing but play it

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
And there's so many clones of that game now

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I know I have a free one on the iPhone

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Crazy stuff

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Alright guys that's it for this part 8 of our show

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000

News about a Yars Revenge remake

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
And it's really not what you think guys

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Talking about an exciting new pinball table

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I know will make Dark Sakura happy

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And a new Dreamcast collection

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And we want to talk a little bit about OnLive

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Because there's been a lot of news about that this week

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
So don't go anywhere guys

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
We'll be right back

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Music

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
And welcome back everybody

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Podcast projects

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Dark Sakura does a little show called

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Comic Insanity

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
But that's N, Comic N-sanity

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
No I in insanity

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
But it's still insane

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
All the less

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And it's awesome-tastic

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And then a brand new World of Warcraft focused show

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
The best little Horde house in Azeroth

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Is now available on iTunes

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
You can just sort for Horde house

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And there it is

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
So some of our side projects, that's me and Xtaphir with Warcraft chat

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
On this week's episode we had Rice Princess

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And yeah

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
It was definitely me, Xtaphir and Rice Princess

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
That's all I'm gonna say

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Anyhow let's get back into some more gaming news

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Here we got some rapid news

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
We're gonna get to and then Twitter topics

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So if you haven't gotten your Twitter topics in

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Send us a tweet

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And we're gonna get to those in just about 10 minutes

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
But first some quick news stories

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Starting with Loki

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Rock of the Dead

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
The game that actually uses the guitar peripheral

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
For something other than playing guitar

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Is now possibly coming to Facebook

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Apparently Epicenter

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
On Conspiracies game

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Is kind of a little bit like

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Typing of the Dead

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Except with the guitar type controller

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
And it is gonna be coming

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Of course in a guitar less

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Version sometime in 2011

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And apparently development

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Is started

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Or is slated to start Q1

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Of next year

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And it's a few

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
They say it's a Facebook game

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
So what a couple weeks after that

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
So that's kind of neat I guess

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
It'd be something different to play

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
On Facebook

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Rock band

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
This week has some pretty cool stuff

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Coming out

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Including John Lennon's Imagine album

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
So you can buy the whole album

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
For $15

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Or the equivalent in points

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Or each individual song

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Which includes

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Crippled Inside

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Jealous Guy

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
It's So Hard

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I Don't Wanna Be A Soldier's Mama

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Gimme Some Truth

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Oh My Love

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
How Do You Sleep

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
How

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Oh Yoko

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
And of course the Pro Guitar

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
And Bass Expansions

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Are available for

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Looks like actually only one of the songs

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
In that pack How Do You Sleep

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
That has Pro Guitar and Bass

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And then

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Lastly

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Looks like

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Ark the Lad

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And Ark Arena are coming

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
To the Playstation Network

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Next week

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
So you can get your 8-Bit

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Gaming on there

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Looks like Ark the Lad 2

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Will be available for $5.99

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Well Ark Arena

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I guess it was an offshoot of the series

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Will be

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Can be purchased with Ark the Lad 2

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
For $8.99

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I don't know if the other

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Ark Arena is gonna be available separately

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
But

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
That'll be coming Tuesday November 23rd

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
That's very soon to see now

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Yes a couple days away

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Some of the quick stories here

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
This one is about

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Hold on I have to have an excuse to play this song

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I've been doing this show for what almost 9 years now

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And I don't know if I've ever had an excuse to play this song

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Let's see here

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Gotta pull it up real quick

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
And here we go

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
We played this once in Marching Band

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
That's right it's a Monty Python story

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Yes we've managed to find a

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Story about video games and Monty Python

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Of course it might not be the

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Type of video games you're really into

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
But it's a UK company called

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Zatika

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Which is trying to make a social

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Game based out of the Monty

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Python license

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
They also have games called

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Buttscan

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Yes that's right Buttscan

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And Mr. Bean out of control

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
That's already being made for

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
The iOS stuff

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
So I don't know whatever

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Here's a quote from the press release

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Monty Python is one of the most iconic

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Comedy licenses around but there has been no new

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Material for over 20 years

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
By acquiring these rights we will be transporting

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Monty Python into the 21st century

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
With a totally new experience for their unique

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Comedy that will delight old and new

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Fans alike. Forget Web 2.0

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
This is Python 2.1 and 3.25

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Well you know what

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
They did something a while back called

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
I do remember that

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
And it had the desktop pythonizer that

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Turned every other sound on your keyboard into farts

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And a game called

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Spam

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Which filled your screen with a giant can of spam

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And says try to locate the kind of spam

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I love Monty Python

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But this game will probably

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Be about the parrot sketch or something

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
That's been just beaten into the ground

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Speaking of things beaten into the ground

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Are you suggesting that the parrot is dead?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
This is an

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Expedite

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Anyhow

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
This might be an ex MMO pretty soon

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Final Fantasy 14

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Has extended their free trial

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
For yet another 30 days

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
This is the second time

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
They've done this and they have

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Promised that there's a big update coming

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
On November 25th

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
So this 30 days is a

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Thank you to the existing fan base

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
For sticking with it through all this crap

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
It'd be hilarious

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Isn't November 25th like Thanksgiving?

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Wouldn't it be hilarious if the

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Update wasn't actually an update

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
The fix on the 22nd, Monday, 23rd, Tuesday

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
The 25th is Thanksgiving, they're putting in a patch

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And I mean I realize it's probably

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
In Japan and they don't really have the same holidays

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
We do but it's still just kind of funny to me

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
But wouldn't it be funny though if the new update wasn't

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Exactly one to fix all the bugs

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
It was just like the holiday event

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Right, right. It's a big update

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
There's now snowmen

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Yes, but no auction house

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
No auction house

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Snowmen and fireworks

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Santa costume

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
There's a whole thread

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Actually now I'm curious, I gotta look at what is

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Coming in the November update

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
There's also another update coming in December

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Wow

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
The update's actually just a download

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
For Final Fantasy XI

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
That's right, they are making changes to

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Events and battles

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
UI, they're changing

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
The macro functions, some new map features

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
You can now expand and

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Collapse your map

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
That sounds useful

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Also the map

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
The mouse will now scroll your map

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
That also sounds very useful

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
The left mouse button

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Has been enabled for use

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Good job Square

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
For making my mouse

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Look, I realize the game was developed for a system

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
That has no mouse, but come on

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
The ability to turn left has been added to our

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Make sure

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
No longer will you have to

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Sprint, but the walking

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Functionality will be enabled

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I know there's a

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Hardcore Final Fantasy XIV fan out there

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Listening to this show going, you guys are assholes

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
You guys are just assholes, you don't understand

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Out of the ability

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
To use your right leg

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Rob, that little voice that you did

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Just sounded like Dane Cook's

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Impersonation of himself in the womb

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Don't you ever compare me to

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Dane Cook ever again

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I can't help that is what you sounded like

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Don't you ever

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Moving on

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Ziba in our chatroom says

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I still don't think they have chocobos yet

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Isn't it mandatory in Final Fantasy games

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Like you have to have a chocobo somewhere

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Even the fucking Facebook games have chocobos

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
No, no, no, they're not chocobos anymore

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Now they're just giant turkeys

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Remember, because it's all the same, but different

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Just like, you know

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
That's right, they're now called

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Chocobocos

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Chocobocos

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Chocobocos

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Yeah

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
They're very, very buff

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
They're muscle bound and wearing spandex

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Loki should design an MMO

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
He really should

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
My MMO would be awesome

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
What would your MMO be all about?

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I don't know, it'd be very freeform

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Now we don't want to necessarily rip off

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Freeform like that

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
It's like second

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Organized chaos, if you will

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I don't know

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
I'd start off with a traditional MMO

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And then I would take suggestions

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I would take most of those suggestions

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Alright, anyhow

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I had my own

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Random things

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Now who's interrupting who?

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
You asked, I wasn't done talking

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
So technically you are interrupting me

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Let me finish

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Let me finish

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I'm finished

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Are you really finished?

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
God damn you

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Amaze Satsuma says

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I want a turducken made out of turkey bows

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
There you go

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Chocobos have now been replaced with turduckens

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And no, my MMO would not be like

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Bonetown, Bonetown is lame

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
My MMO is not lame

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Salacious pop

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Salacious pop

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Salacious pop

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
In our chat

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I'm assuming this is about the Loki MMO

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I'm a dual spec

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Bacon baron and titty hound

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Oh, so you're Loki's wife

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Alright

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Anyhow, moving on

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Hey

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
More Blizzard news that isn't WoW

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
This is about Diablo

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And apparently

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
There might be, there could possibly

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Be the possibility

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
That Diablo might

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Maybe happen on consoles

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Here's

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Here's the company's official response

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:37.000
To speculation

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Funny, I know someone that

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Would be very

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Appropriate for that

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
It's a studio called Bizarre Creations

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Unfortunately you just

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Fired them, so

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Yeah, it's a little awkward

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Yeah, I'm sure

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
That Diablo would be perfect for consoles

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Because it would make them lots of money

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I mean, seriously, if they thought Bloodstone

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Was a good idea

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Then Diablo is gonna be a great idea

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Now, please

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Note that Blizzard made it very clear

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
On the job posting itself

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Quote, please note this is

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Not an announcement of a console title

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
We are first and foremost developing

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Diablo 3 for Windows and Macs

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
PCs, and don't intend to allow

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Any possibility of a console interpretation

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
To delay or affect the release of that game

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Yes, we first and foremost are developing

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
That, and then we're gonna develop

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
The console version, which we just announced

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Right now, Diablo Ghost coming

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Soon everybody, Diablo Ghost

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Soon on a console near you

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Check it out

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Or don't

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
DarkSakura, what do you got for us before we get to Twitter topics?

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Stuff and nonsense

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
How about an arcade game called

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Let's Connect

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
It, um, basically

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
It was at the

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
IAPPA

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Man, that's gonna be kind of a tone twister

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Trade show, and it uses

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
The Kinect to

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Play things that are like

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I guess the Nintendo's Play Choice 10

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Cabinets, you know, you can pick your game

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
And, um

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
So, it's not actually official

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Microsoft thing, but

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
The manufacturer Quasimodo Interactive

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Um

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Needed the license to play

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
The games publicly, so

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I don't know how well that's

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Gonna work, but it's a neat idea

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And then, uh, Kingdom Hearts

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
3D will have

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
New Disney World

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Ooh

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
They are, uh

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
It's gonna have, uh

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
It's gonna be, of course, on the 3DS

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
And it will have Sora and Riku

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And, um

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
They're just gonna be different places

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
I would say that they have to

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Pan out

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
But this is, but they're gonna

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
You know, still have the Traverse Town

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
And all the other places still be there

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
But, new places

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
They could do a zone on Princess and the Frog

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
And some of the new things that have come out, but

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
At Cauldron level

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
How about, uh, since there is a new Tron movie

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I'm just saying, the Tron universe can be revisited

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I know!

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
The Space Paranoids level needs to be updated

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Seriously, Disney, if you want a really

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Good primetime animated series

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Boom! There it is

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I'm surprised that hasn't happened, actually

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
It would be awesome

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
There's manga already

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Yeah, that's pretty cool, but

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I mean, seriously

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
You get their animation team behind it

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
And you could do something really

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Awesome

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Awesome while we were cleaning, Axel

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Hot

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Because, I mean, seriously, it's a great series

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
To get people at sea may not be

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I have another story

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Interested in the characters

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Back, you know, into those characters

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
And in other news

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Star Trek Online

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Season 3! Yay!

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Didn't season 2 just come out?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
A couple months ago

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
But they've just finished up

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Some of the new episodes

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I actually just finished the Davidian

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Missions, and it actually takes some kind of

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Lame psychic energy

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Stealing creatures from the next generation

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
And makes them actually pretty cool and

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Badass in a very Silent Hill

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Level sort of thing, it was really cool

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Well, I guess that's kind of cool that they're supporting it

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
As well as they are

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
They put out the scary ones for around Halloween, it was really neat

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Season 4 is going to be entirely in the holodeck

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And it's going to be set in the Wild West

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
The server's called the holodeck

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Our server's called the holodeck

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Our test server's called Tribble

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
At any rate

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Can I play on the Zachary Quinto server?

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Actually, he does voices for a character

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Right at the beginning of the game

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
The emergency medical hologram

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I'll be playing that level with the lights off

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Anyway

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
What is your emergency?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
As I was saying

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
The third season

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Starts on December 9th

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
And has a mission

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Creation beta

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
So it's for the

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Foundry is what it's called

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
There's also going to be unlockable Borg tech

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Mission replay

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Which is what I'm looking for

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Shut up Rob

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
I'm laughing at what you said, not what you said

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
But I'm looking forward to the mission replay

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Because there were some pretty fun missions

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
There's also going to be one thing that's not in this little piece

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
That I was reading up on

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
The Star Trek Online forums

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
They're going to have extra accolades

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And different prizes you can get for

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Your ship builder missions

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
And making changes to some of them

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Based on your rank and that type of thing

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
So it's looking pretty good

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
They've also got

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Some sort of online ship builder thing too

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
And don't forget about translating your tweets into Klingon

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I'm sorry I'm not programmed to do that

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Oh, you know what they just released

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Which I thought was absolutely retarded

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I mean, not even just retarded

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
But retarded

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
They released the Enterprise

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Outfit packs

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Vulcan chick

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I'm like, dude, that series sucked

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I did get the 7 of 9 outfit though

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I will put pictures up

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
On our website soon

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
You can have 7 of 9

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
But I can't have Zulu

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
You can just have her outfit

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Where everybody gets goatees

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
The evil pack

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
The evil pack

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Tyra Crew gets goatees

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I like that

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Did anyone ever have a goatee in Star Trek except for him?

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I don't remember

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Everyone in Star Trek was fairly clean shaven

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Except for Riker

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
The old school Klingons

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
They all had those weird sort of

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Goatees

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
And now most of the Klingons have uberbeards

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Alright, anyhow

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Let's not turn this into a Star Trek show

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
As much as Star Trek would like that

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Let's go to the Twitter

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Every week you guys send us your tweets

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
13forever

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
13crossforever

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
13xforever

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Sends us some tweets

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Wants to alert us to the whole Age of Empires 3 for 10 cents

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
As a lot of people have been doing today

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Just gamers wanting to spread the word about next to free ship

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
But he also wanted to point out

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Game for Windows Marketplace also has

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Bioshock 2 for $9.99

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And some cheap add-ons for it

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
So I guess the 10 cent deal

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Is not the only deal out there

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
I think Bioshock 1 was available for $1.99

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
For a day somewhere

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Probably on Steam

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
See, this is the one reason I support

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
This whole Game for Windows thing

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Because competition, we're all gonna win

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
With these companies

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Trying to undercut each other

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
It's gonna be awesome

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Zebo wanted to alert us to the Final Fantasy 14

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Free trial will be extended again

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
But I already covered that

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Thanks for trying

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Let's see, Retertainment for whatever reason

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Just sent us a tweet that is a picture of Pito Bear

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
In the TSA logo

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Saying the U.S. Department of Molestation

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I don't know if I find that funny

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Just kidding, it's funny

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Pito Bear is always funny

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
My favorite though, nothing will ever top

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
The Pito Bear on the Trader Joe's price tag

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
It was like for honey

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Or something

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I'm sorry, it was funny

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Let's see, TigerClaw sends us a couple of stories

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
On the tweeters

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
One of this is about a really cool hack

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I'm surprised he didn't say anything about this yet

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
But apparently it's using the Open Connect drivers

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Apparently used the Open Connect drivers

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And image processing

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
To create a lightsaber effect

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
On his PC

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Out of a wooden stick

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
And so the Kinect tracks the wooden stick

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
And replaces it with a lightsaber

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
That is awesome, sir

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
You win the internet

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
And yet, how long is it gonna take for the real lightsaber game

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
To come out, especially with all these layoffs

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Later next year

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
By the way, there's a YouTube out there

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
So of course I'm gonna turn it on and watch this guy

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Oh, this is way better than Star Wars, kid

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Just saying

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
It's actually kinda awesome

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
It's kind of

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
The delay on that is not as terrible as you'd think

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
I mean, it's not totally fluid

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
But it's not horrible

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Kinda neat, I like that

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
They're just early drivers, they'll get better

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Again, our Twitter

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
O-L-R

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Another tweet from Tiger Claw

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Sending us this one about Pac-Man

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
It's another Pac-Man story, but it's not about Pac-Man Championship Edition DX

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
It is about the Rose Parade

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Yeah, Namco Bandai

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Has said that a 55 foot tall display

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Featuring Pac-Man and

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Is going to be one of the first

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
I'm sorry, the first video game focused

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Float in the 122 year old

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Tournament of Roses parade

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
It's because of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
There's going to be a cake toting

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Pac-Man surrounded by presents

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
And standing atop a bright and colorful

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Cornucopia of floral arrangements

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
You have to remember, it's the Rose Parade

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
There's tons of floral arrangements on every float

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
So, that's kinda cool

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And if you want to see that on TV

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
8 AM Pacific time on Saturday

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
New Year's Day

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
That's right, you have to get up at 8 AM

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Or set your TiVo

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Or just wait for the YouTube that will inevitably show up on all the gaming blogs

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
There you go

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Anyway, Sonic the Hedgehog was the first

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Video game character that ever had a balloon

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
But that was in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
That's a whole other parade

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Pikachu was also in that parade

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
But in 2001

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
And then escaped and killed everybody

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Yes, it did

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
But no one wants to report on that

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Let's see, Spazenator

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
PSN wants us to note

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
That there is a release that didn't get mentioned earlier

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
The Magic the Gathering game

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
That is on Xbox Live Arcade is being ported

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
To PSN this Tuesday

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
And he sends a follow-up tweet

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Saying, I recommend the Magic the Gathering

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
PSN game for those who don't already have it

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
On Xbox Live Arcade or like

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
The Magic the Gathering card game

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Yeah, it was a pretty faithful translation

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
It's kinda hard to translate an intricate

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Card game like that when cards can be played

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
At a variety of times

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
To a console, but they did a pretty decent job

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Even though I think

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
It plays a little faster in real life

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
But still kinda neat

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
And certainly a lot cheaper

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Oh my god, trying to collect those cards?

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Geez

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
So I think that's gonna close it for the Twitter

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
I'm doing one last refresh to make sure we don't get any last minute tweets

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Nope, I don't see any

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
So I hope that's not a bug or whatever

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
But yeah, Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets in the future

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
In the meantime

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Some more news stories for you guys

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Then we're gonna be getting to the Skype line in a little bit

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
At 1-877-GAME-OLR

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
But first, Loki

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Ah, yes

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Um, I don't know what to think of this

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
I honestly didn't play the first game

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
But this doesn't sound

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Very close to the original image

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Of Yars' Revenge

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Uh, Yars' Revenge is being made

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Or remade into an anime-inspired rail shooter

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Um

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Honestly

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
It

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
It seems like

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
A stretch to me

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
I was making the joke earlier saying that

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
It really should have been about an angry pirate

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
But, um

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
YARRRR

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
YARRR I will have my revenge

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
But, uh, yeah

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
It's supposed to be like some sort of

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
You know, they're saying like

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Like a Xeno saga

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Or something like that

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I don't know

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
It seems like a stretch to me

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Um, it's kinda weird

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Because Yars' Revenge was like

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Probably one of the greatest Atari 2600 games

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
There ever was

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
That wasn't by Activision

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Um, I've never played it

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
It's cool, but you know

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
You play it now

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And you go like, there's not a lot to this

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
What is this? But you have to remember

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Atari 2600 games were very straightforward

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Back in the day, I mean

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Games were four kilobytes

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
In size back then

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
You write essays now that are longer than that

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
You know what I mean? Like, they had to cram a lot

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
In those little cartridges, so most of the games were

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Very straightforward

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
So fine, they're reinventing it or whatever

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
But this whole like, anime chick

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
And rail shooter, like, doesn't seem to be

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
At all similar

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
To what was there before

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
As long as there's like, some

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Resemblance to the original game

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
I would approve

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
But I have a bad feeling I'm not gonna be seeing that

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Yeah

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I mean, I guess a good game's a good game

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
No matter what they do artistically

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
With it, but I just

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I think y'all can see where we're all a little

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Apprehensive

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
But we'll see, we have yet to really

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
See gameplay, the only trailer that's come

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Out so far is this weird announcement video

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Right? Yes. So

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
We'll see when gameplay comes out

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
That's true, Dungeon Busters

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
In our chatroom saying, there was more

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Story in the manual than there was in the

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Actual Yars Revenge game, very true

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Very true point

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Alright, moving on to another story

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Talk about more old

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Games making a comeback, but this time not quite

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
As old, it's the Dreamcast collection

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Yay

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
The Dreamcast collection has been listed for the

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Xbox 360 and the PS3

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
This was caught in a listing on GameStop

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
It's the Dreamcast collection

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Supposed to cost $29.99

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
And the date that is tentative

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Right now anyway for release is February 15th

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
You shouldn't really treat these

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
GameStop leaks as, you know

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Word and Bond and all that because

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
It could change, and a lot of these are

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Service holders to get people to pre-order them

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
But you what?

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
I haven't seen anything yet

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Okay, here's the weird thing though

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Is that Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Are the only announced

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Dreamcast games right now

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Now those games are going to cost $10

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Well obviously Sonic Adventure already came out

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Crazy Taxi I believe is this week

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
They cost only $10 a piece to download

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
So it would make no sense why you would drop

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
$30 on this game when these two games

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Are $20

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Some more XBLA and PSN ports

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
That have not yet been announced

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Are coming

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
By the way there were a couple that had leaked

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Previously including Sega Bass Fishing

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
And Space Channel 5

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Part 2

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
So that could be

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Where this is going is that maybe it will be

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Four games in one

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Although I could really do without Sega Bass Fishing

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I'm sorry but I'm not really into the

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Fishing games but whatever

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
But

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Okay it was fun with the rod controller

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
And

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
But mostly because of the fact like haha

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
It's a rod controller now I'm over it

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
And then in the Japanese version it would say

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
FISH GET

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
We need the game that was formally named

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Daytona

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Do do do do do do

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Have you seen the new one now?

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
They don't have the Daytona song in there

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
So it's like do do do do do do

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Let's go

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Let's go

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Cheat pack

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
It's pretty fun

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Thank you. So ladies and gentlemen in our chat room

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Needs to have Power Stone 1 and 2

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Thanks. Agreed with those Capcom games

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Ah yes they were

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
So probably not gonna happen

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
But you can dream

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Remember Power Stone collection did come out on

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
PSP. Oh that's right. Good call

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Anyhow Dark Sakura

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
What do you have for us?

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I have stuff and nonsense again

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Actually this is pretty cool

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Pinball is coming to Xbox Live

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Arcade and Playstation Network

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
In December

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Put out by Zen Studios

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Um

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
It actually was leaked out

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Because of a ratings board

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Deal

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
But it's going to be coming out

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
And it will have

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Different tables that are

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Themed after Marvel

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Superheroes like one that I'm looking at

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Right now is Iron Man Pinball

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
I don't know

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
If it's actually patterned after the stern Iron Man

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Pinball. I don't think so

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Because that table kinda sucked

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
The one based off of the movie

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Not for the comic

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
And then they said initially

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Four different tables will be available

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
There's Blade, Spiderman, Wolverine and as I said

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Iron Man

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Taking a look at some of them right now

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
And there's also supposed to be

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
New download content coming

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Later on

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Okay the Blade one looks stupid

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Iron Man one looks okay

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Spiderman one looks kinda fun

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Um

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
The Wolverine one

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
It's Wolverine

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Oh it's alright

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
I don't know it could be fun

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
I'm kinda picky on my Pinball

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I'll check it out. I think Pinball FX2 is pretty awesome

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Yeah we got it

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Good times

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
It's free. Everybody should go get it if you don't already have it

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
I know right

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
It's the same. It automatically imports all the tables

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I think I talked about this last week or the week before

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
You did? I did

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Well it's not a big surprise

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Rumors that the

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
PSP2 prototype

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
They have leaked images

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Of it and

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
It's actually been confirmed by some

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Developers

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Saying that the photos are legitimate

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
But that it's

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
A dev kit and that the hardware

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Will probably change

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
The way it looks by the time the system comes out

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
But some of the features that were

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Noticed in the pictures

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
It's got a front facing camera

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Microphone

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Finally two analog

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Sticks which is awesome

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Also has a back facing camera

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
And the rumored

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Trackpad which is on the back

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Of the device

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
That seems awfully weird to me

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Unless somehow the screen like

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Flips over where you can use the trackpad on the front

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
But um

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Neat

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
I guess

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
The prototype right now looks very similar

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
To like the PSP Go

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
But they're saying that it's possible that they may

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Make either

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
They're gonna have like two different models

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
One that resembles like the PSP 3000

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
And one the PSP Go or it's gonna be just

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
The PSP Go

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Also it will not have a UMD drive

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Instead it will be using

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Some sort of memory

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Sticks

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Interesting so they are

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Saying there's gonna be a physical media

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
But it's just not gonna be these discs anymore

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Uh yeah

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Let me be the first to say that if it's gonna be memory

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Sticks that this thing's gonna be using

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
This will be cracked so fast

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
It's not even funny

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Because if it's on a physical device like that

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Why even bother

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I know that's kind of

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
A scary thought on their side

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
But not a lot of other

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Like new things about what could be on this system

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Besides the whole trackpad thing

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
I mean you know

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
The new DS is going

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
All 3D

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
And stuff

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Well the top screen looks like it's supposed to be

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
An HD screen they're saying that the

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Graphics are gonna be comparable to the

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Xbox 360

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Oh interesting

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Alright well I'm sure we'll be hearing

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Plenty more about that at E3

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Because it really is hard to say

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
That this is not at least somewhat

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
True at this point

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Anyhow we got about 6 months to go before E3

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Something that's coming out a lot sooner

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
If you want to get a new console is the

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
OnLive micro console

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
It is coming out December 2nd and it costs

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
$99 this is the whole little

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Console for you to use OnLive on your

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
TV and yeah

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
When they say micro console like this thing

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
It's small I mean it's basically a

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Miniature PC that will just do all the

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Connecting to the internet and the whole cloud

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Gaming thing

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Strange little thing

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
They've already got those internet TV devices

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Like at Fry's so I imagine it's the same deal

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
It's you know all it is is really

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
It just serves the

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Sole function of connecting to the online

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Services and using whatever technology it does to

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Deliver the video just quickly

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
To your TV so

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Kinda cool

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
By the way they are saying that you will only be able to get

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
This though on the OnLive

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Website until like next year

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
And it's only going to be in limited quantities

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
So if you think you might want one of these

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
You gotta act like really soon

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
There is some other news coming out of OnLive

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
They are getting rid

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Of the whole monthly fee that is

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Going out the door

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
There's now going to be a flat rate pricing

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Plan that will provide access to

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Back catalog and indie games

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Kinda similar to what you see with Netflix

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
And all that it's

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
So they're thinking maybe no more than $10

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
A month but there's no longer going to be a fee just to

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Access the service itself which is always

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Kinda a dumb idea and nobody was really

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Paying for it yet anyway because it was like

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Sponsored right now but yeah

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
That is all going out the window which is good

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
More information on the full

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Pricing and the lineup will be coming out in December

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
That's according to the CEO Steve

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Prolem in December we'll announce

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Pricing and the lineup of games it's literally

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Just a matter of getting publishers to sign

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
This and that and the other thing so

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Very cool they eliminated the monthly

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Subscription fee after they kinda pulled the

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
User base and looked there

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
And saw what users really wanted

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
That's cool that they're listening to that

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
That's smart

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Also there

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Could be some new platforms that come to this

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
As well and possibly

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Exclusive games

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
The company is trying to get some big name

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Releases as well Duke Nukem Forever

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Deus Ex Human Revolution

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Red Faction Armageddon

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Ghost Recon Future Soldier Fear 3

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Driver and so on and so on and so on

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
All those types of games they're trying to get as well

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
What's also interesting

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Is that they're looking at

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
iOS versions of the client

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Software so on live

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
On your iPhone

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
That won't work very well I don't know how that would work

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Without better controls

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
But I guess

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
You might

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Might not be too far out of the realm

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Of possibility I mean if Netflix and all that

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Is on there somebody wants to put games on there

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
So I don't have to control with you

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
I know I get that I get that but who knows

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Who knows what could happen

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
So there you go

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
By the way Apple TV they've also

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Been toying with the idea of in Google TV

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
But they say Apple TV

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
May not work because it runs at 720p

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
And 30 frames a second you'll never get above

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
30 frames a second and you can't really

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Get the 720p

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
So

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Who knows

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Anyhow let's move on and open up the old

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Mailbag every week DarkSakura

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Dives into the mailbag head first

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Mailbag at

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com and she pulls out some

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Of her favorite emails and reads them for us

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Live on air but

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
I don't know if there were a lot of pickins this week were there

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
No there weren't but I did get a reply

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
From the one who

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Got the

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Wrong name and because

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
They're so nice about it

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
He's our winner

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Aww what a nice

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Well Mike

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Congratulations you've

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Won a Castlevania Symphony of the

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Night Xbox Live Arcade

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Code

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Enjoy

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Free stuff is always good

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
So that's it

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
That was it for the emails really?

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
We didn't get any questions or nothing?

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
No

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Dear OrangeLoungeRadio why is DarkSakura

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
So cool

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
I don't know listener

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
I think it's in her DNA

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
And that says such a bitch

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Like I think you changed

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Rob got pot hollered

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
At least it wasn't

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Flaming hot pot holder

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Well that was mailbag fail

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Fail

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Every one of you needs to send

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
An email and then we'll get Rob to read them

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
DarkSakura is going to have to read 50 emails next week

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
We'll get our special guest to read them next week

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Do we have special guest next week?

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
You know who our special guest is?

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Marissa

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
I am so excited

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
We need a pile of

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
emails bigger than her boobies

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
That's a lot of emails

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
That's impossible

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Get starting

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Marissa's rack is quite mighty

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Well in the absence of emails

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:33.000
There's always time for FUs

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Um FU to the sudden realization of my unemployment

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I hated that place

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
A lot of the people I worked with

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Actually a lot of them pissed me off too

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
But

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
It's sort of the uncertainty side of things

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
What am I going to do now?

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I'm not having insurance

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
But I get to finish school

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I can sleep in as much as I want to

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And I'm getting my severance check

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
So it's not a big loss

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
But still kind of melancholy

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
You know what I mean?

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
It's a weird in between

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
place kind of be

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
And also um

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.000
I want frozen yogurt a lot so I feed me not having any even though I do have pumpkin ice cream

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
OMG I want pink berry so bad

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Pink berry!

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Let's go

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
That pumpkin pink berry right now

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
It's not good

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
It's not terrible though

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
But it's pumpkin

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Hardly

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Whatever

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Loki

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.000
I guess FU to um

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I don't know black asleep I guess

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
It's just uh

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
You don't have to get up early every day

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
It sucks

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I hate waking up at 4 in the morning

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
And sleeping on the couch

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Well

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
It'll only be for hopefully

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
A few more months

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Or maybe another year or two or three

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
A few more years

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Look forward to it

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
A few more years and then um

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
The random calling into bed and getting kicked in the head

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
That happens too

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
And then when he's like 15 or 16 he's gonna start fighting with you every day

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:15.000
And then your friends who don't have children have to hear about it

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Or your entire internet radio audience that'll be fun

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
I'm also sending major hearts to Becky right now

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
My FU of the week

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Uh goes to all the sand

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.000
That somehow lodged itself in my vagina earlier this week

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Because dang there was a lot of it

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
No I had a really crap week

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
But things got better they always do

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
It gets better guys

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
It gets better

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
That's really it otherwise I'm just

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Just looking forward to getting the week of

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Lady you know

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
You know we're doing a show right

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Yeah

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
But I want Dan to give an FU because Dan's FUs are amazing

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Okay George can do one

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
An FU?

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
FU of the week duh

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Aren't you mad at something that you want to say FU to?

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Jamie loves to put people on the squad

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I know I love doing it George

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Which is kind of shocking because I'm normally mad at everything

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
What's that George? Hi George

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Hello

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
I'm normally mad at everything but I'm not mad at anything this week

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Well FU for being so happy

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Damn you and your happiness

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
So I gave you one

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
That's awesome

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Alright

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Poor George

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
That's when people come over to my house they get to be on the show

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
You come over to my house you're going to be telling them my show

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Get in here

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Nobody gets off the stage unless they sing the blues

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
You know where that came from right

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Adventures in babysitting

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Just a couple more stories then we're going to get to the skype line

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
At 1877 game

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
O-L-R

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Hey oh I don't know if I like this

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Jamie get ready to rage

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
What? Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
FU to Jamie for fucking up the FUs of the week

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
You know what

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Don't say that to somebody with ops

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Because I will kick your ass

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Literally

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Alright

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Oh no

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Oh no he didn't

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Alright

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Oh he says FU to myself

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Alright

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I don't care

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Alright lowkey come on let's move on

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Portal 2 has been delayed again

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Yeah man it wasn't going to come out

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
When they said anything

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Wait wait wait wait you mean Valve delayed a game?

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
What?

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
What?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
And this is news?

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
That's alright though it's just putting extra polish on it

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
It's been delayed to April 20th 2011

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
The day after my birthday

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
People you know what to do

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
It's the day after your birthday

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
You're screwed

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
My birthday lasts all week

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
It was originally planned for holiday 2010

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
And delayed to February 9th

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
2011

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
So now it's April

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
I kind of always thought it was going to be April anyways

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I thought that's what it was

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
I didn't realize it was actually February

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
It was the release date for that but yeah whatever

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
It's April now so get over it

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Alright just in time for Jamie's birthday

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
What about my birthday?

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
What are you going to get me for my birthday Valve?

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I'll give you a dollar

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
You're not Valve

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I'll give you a Valve

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
I'm sure we got a couple

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Alright file this last story

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Of our night under what

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
And huh

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Yeah this is a

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Comment from Bobby Kotick I don't know why

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Whatever this guy says makes news but I don't know

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
You love to hate him or you hate to love him

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I don't know very interesting comic

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Though a comic

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Freudian slip maybe I don't know

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Very interesting comment from Mr. Kotick

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Though it's about the online pass

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Thing you know EA, THQ

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
$10 online play if you buy

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
The game used

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Quote from Bobby Kotick

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
We can do some of these things

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
EA's and others have done

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
We actually don't think it's in the best interest

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Of the gamer and so we've chosen not to

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
From a financial

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Perspective you look at it and say

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Okay well the retailer is not paying us

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Anything for the privilege of doing it and you know

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
We invest all this capital in making a game

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
We're not getting any credit any return on their

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Resale of the game but you know something

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
The best way to keep people engaged in your game

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Experience is to keep giving them

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
More great content

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
I think you always need to be sensitive to that

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Relationship and not crossing the line to a

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Place where the customer feels like they

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Have been taken advantage of

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
So that's why

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
They would rather put out $15

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Map packs for their games

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Than an online pass

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
You know what though

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
I'm actually kind of okay

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
With that

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I mean

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
It would be better if it was cheaper but at least

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
It's like more content

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
But the only thing, here's what I don't like

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Is that when that additional content

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Is um

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Stuff that like is

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Necessary to the game and what I

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Really hate is when that content is already

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
On the disc because that is not

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Downloadable content, oh man I haven't gone on

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Download to unlock, I haven't gone on this rant

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
In years, that is not downloadable

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Content that is pay to unlock

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Content and that's what we should be referring

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
To it as, when you're

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Paying to unlock content on our young disc

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Like beautiful

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Katamari on the 360, had plenty of pay

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
To unlock content

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
There it is

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Alright that's gonna do it for our

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
News stories tonight

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
We're gonna open up the Skype line now, I should probably take us

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Off Do Not Disturb in order to do that

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Or you can give us a call on the old telefono

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
877-GAME-OLR

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Is our name on

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
I'm sorry 877-GAME-OLR

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Is our phone number

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
And you can give that a call

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
In the meantime

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
I don't know if Loki has any

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Last minute stories tonight but

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
You have anything last minute for us Loki?

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Uh

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Yeah apparently there's gonna be

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
A new cheat tool coming to the

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
PlayStation 3 from Code Freak

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Um

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Apparently the people

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Behind the Code Freak

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Um tool

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
CyberGadget have announced a new device coming

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
To the PS3 in Japan

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Um it's a

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Walkthrough tool as they call it

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
And it's gonna cost 7800 yen

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
And it'll come with cheats for 50 titles

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
And they say

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
More codes can be downloaded via

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
PC

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
So I don't know

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000
It sounds like modified saves almost

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Shall we go to the phones?

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Yes let's

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Hey this is X-Link

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Hi X-Link

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I just had to beat out Rama for one week

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
That's alright long time listener first time caller right?

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
As always

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000
What's on your mind?

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I have a question for you

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
How the hell can you dog Age of Empire 3

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
But yet you will play Civilization

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Because I'm a hypocrite

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I'm just kind of curious

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I was like wait a minute you're sitting there saying

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Age of Empire is not worth the 10 cents

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
But yet you would play

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Powers on end Civilization 5

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Because I have a very simple answer for you

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
It's just gonna blow your mind

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
My simple answer for all of this X-Link

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
It's amazing I can't solve world peace

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
You ready?

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
The reason why I don't want to pay 10 cents

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
For Age of Empires 3 is because

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
I have Civilization 5

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I don't need anything else

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Well that's true I kind of agree with you

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Unfortunately I don't have Civilization 5

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
So I have to go with the next best thing for right now

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
But yes

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
In all seriousness

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
You know what 10 cents for a game is obviously a steal

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
But I'm just more making fun of the fact that like

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
The entirety of the internet is freaking out about like

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
OMG game for 10 cents

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
But it's kind of like well yeah

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.000
The game's 5 years old and who would give a shit about this anyway

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
It's like most of the Steam sales

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
You rarely see current games

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Going on sale on Steam

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Although to be fair

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Steam does manage to get some of those really good deals

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Like you know when they were putting Torchlight on sale

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
For like half its price

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
They've done some deals with Poker Night which isn't even out yet

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
So you know

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Which I'm looking forward to that

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Because that supposedly is going to be coming out Tuesday

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
So I'm definitely looking forward to that

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I think it's actually tomorrow

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Is it tomorrow? I think so

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Maybe it's tomorrow

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Jeremy Todd one in our chatroom says

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
But it's only 10 cents

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I bought it 6 different times just so I can have more AOE 3 than you

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Now that's showing your support

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Wow

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Yeah but yeah

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
You know again

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Competition never a bad thing

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
I'm really excited for Black Friday

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
OMG we're going to get some steal games

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
But that's a really good deal though

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
10 cents you can't really

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Don't really want to pass that up

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
For even a game I mean even if you don't get a gift

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
For somebody else you know 10 cents

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
We'll see we'll see

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.000
It sounds like almost like we're doing one of those info commercials for those children

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I know right

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
It's just the price of a cup of coffee a day

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Precisely

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
But you know I saw that I was amazed by that

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I'm like a $40 game 10 cents

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Well it was $40 back in 2005

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.000
But I guarantee you that game is in like $3 bargain bins

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
At Best Buys everywhere

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Probably but according to their website it was still at $40

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Well of course because it's a Microsoft game

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
They don't want to admit that it's you know

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Yes they officially haven't dropped the price of it

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Does not mean everybody else hasn't to try to clear out inventory

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
That's right

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Speaking of Microsoft and things like that

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
I'm actually looking forward to this whole Dungeon Siege 3

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Even though technically it's what Squeenix is doing it now

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Microsoft has done the first couple games

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
I'm looking forward to that

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Those should be very interesting

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Hopefully they don't bastardize it like Final Fantasy XIV

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Well it's not like an online MMO type of thing

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
And don't feel too bad

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I was right with you with the whole raid thing

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Remember because unfortunately my account

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I was stupid and let it lapse

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
So I wasn't there during that whole time

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Yeah we're not able to take phone calls during Horde House

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
So I know you couldn't really chime in on this

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
But yeah I know we both missed it

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
At least you don't have to feel all alone

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Like I'm the only one who didn't get it

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
No I'm right there with you

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
All in due time my friend

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Yeah I know we'll get it eventually

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
We just might be level 81 or 82

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.000
But hey it'll work out

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
We'll be geared for it

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Cataclysm happening soon

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
The rumor on the street is that the world is coming to an end

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
On Tuesday in World of Warcraft

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000
It's the end of the world as we know it

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
But I feel fine

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
They're doing a lot of odds and ends and disconnects

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Going to be more Gloriant than ever

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
So yes

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
We all look forward to that

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Now you started playing WoW with Wrath of the Lich King right?

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
So are you looking forward to your first

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Proper expansion rolling out?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
No because I don't have the money for it

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Aww

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Well you know what the good news is though

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
You won't be competing with everyone else

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Trying to level in those zones and everything

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Because it's going to be a shit show

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I was going to do that anyways to be quite honest

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
My first goal when that was going to come out

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Was going to be the archeology

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
To get that to 450

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Gotcha

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Well anyway the other hosts are going to start

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Glaring at me if I fill up the show with the Warcraft chat

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Nope

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
My eyes glosed over and my brain went foggy

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Exactly

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
That's why they made me take it to a separate show

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Have a good one

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Thanks for calling

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Bye

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Meanwhile do we have any last minute stories

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Mr. Loki over there

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Well good

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Because we have other calls coming in so we might as well go to those calls

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Hey it's Ronman this time my Skype works

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Long time listener first time caller right

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Hi

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
What's on your mind buddy

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Hey um

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Now this is something I wanted to talk about

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Unfortunately I wasn't able to last week but

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
This is the whole

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Music game genre with

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Rock band and guitar hero

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Now let me ask you

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Guys do you see it

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Like really dying

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Dead like DDR or

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Something else

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
DDR hasn't exactly fallen

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Over dead though like I get what you're saying

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
DDR is not what it was to

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
You and me ten years ago

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
But they did just release a game

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Two weeks ago so I don't see any

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Reason why they won't continue to release

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Rock band style plastic guitar and drum

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Games ten years from now

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
But it's not going to be what it was

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
In it's hey day when rock band and all

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
This stuff first came out

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Okay cause the way I see it is this

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Konami throws us DDR

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Yay here's another one

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Yay here's another one

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Wait wait what is this

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Yeah Konami we got to talk what is

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
This drop

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Or as with rock band and guitar hero

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Here you go yay

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Here you go plus we threw her some

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
More stuff sweet

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Here's another game this time

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
We'll give you more stuff sweet

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
That's the way I see it

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
And having an interesting

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Discussion with a couple of people on Twitter about this

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Who think that the whole

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Gaming rhythm gaming is falling

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Apart due to lack of sales

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
I honestly believe lack of sales

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Come from the fact of it's too

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Damn expensive because of the pricing

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Of the bundles and all the other accessories

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
More or less right about now in this economy

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Who has 180 bucks

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
And what I would tell your friends on

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Twitter is again the sales

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Of Dance Central sort of

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Kind of counters that argument that music games

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Are just dead in the water

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Music games are just evolving

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Plastic guitar and plastic drum games

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Are on their way out

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
That is what these studies are showing

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
What has the music genre been focused on for the past few years

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
What has the media been focused on for the past few years

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
It's all about these plastic guitar games

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Alright their time is coming to an end

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Let's bring on the next big thing in music gaming

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
It's out there somewhere

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Which is why I don't blame

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
EA for not bundling

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Rock band 3

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
With a pro guitar

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Or even a regular guitar

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
My roommate went to go buy the game like last Sunday

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
He comes back and he's like I didn't buy the game

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
It's because all the instruments are not made by EA anymore

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
So that's why they're not doing any of the bundles

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Even the bundles with the keyboard were actually

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Being published by Mad Cats

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
And they opted out on doing

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Bundles with all that stuff because they need to have

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
80,000 bundles in the stores

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
And it would confuse people

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Most retailers though are kind of smart

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
And they put the plastic guitars

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Right next to the game, you know what I mean?

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Exactly, and I explained that to him

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
But he still, it took me like 3 days

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
To explain to him, they're not bundling it

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Because it's a different company making the accessories

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
If you want the pro guitar that badly

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Just be like everybody else

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Pre-order, go down there

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
And whoop somebody's ass to get one

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Interesting, I wonder if

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Just all this saturation is partially to blame

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Well, as we went into a couple weeks ago

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
On the show, it kind of is

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I think Guitar Hero

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
In some ways is to blame for rock bands

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Tumble

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
But I don't know, you know what?

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
We still have All Christmas to get through

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I think they'll still sell more copies of Rock Band 3

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
I tend to think so too

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
And you know

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Not for nothing, I did pick up Rock Band

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
The Beatles' Rock Band, but I can understand why

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
The game didn't do so well

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
And the same thing with Green Day Rock Band

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Because it's simple

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Most of today's, to this generation

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Probably had never heard of the Beatles

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
I guarantee you

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
I guess it's just me being biased

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
But if it was Rock Band, Bon Jovi

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
I think we would have done at least 2-3 times

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Normal sales

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Because everybody's heard of Bon Jovi

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Hate me if you want

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
That's not really a game I'd be interested in

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
That's the problem with these games

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
No matter what, no matter who the band is

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
That they pick, because I'll sit here and go

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
But give me Rock Band Journey and oh my god

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
You know, but I realize it's still not going to sell

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Any better, you know, I think

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
You take the Beatles

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
They are the biggest selling band of all time

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Whether they are anymore or whatever

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
It's just one of those, you know what?

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
A game so focused on one band

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Is never going to appeal to a mass market

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
But Rob, if they gave you the choice

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
If they said, okay, hey, we're going to release

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Rock Band Journey as a standalone game

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Or you can download all the songs

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
You probably download all the songs

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
I would like it better if I could download all the songs

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.000
And like a Journey themed background or something

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Fair enough

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
You know what I mean? Like something to kind of add into the Rock Band experience

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Which I'm kind of surprised they haven't done

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Like, you know, you have all these track packs

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Or whatever, why not have like a

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
You know, no doubt themed arena

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
To go with the CD or something like that, you know?

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I'm glad you asked that question, and the reason why

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Is because they have each song

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
They have programmed in

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Different camera cuts and stuff

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Depending on which stage they're in

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
And if they add another stage, they go back and edit

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Every single song to add that stage into it

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Interesting

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
I always thought it was just more generic than that

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Like, you know, cut here, cut here, or whatever

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
No. Interesting

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Rob, you're right about that

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
You wouldn't buy the game, but

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
What I see is this

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
If it was out of like ten people

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Maybe eight people would buy

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
The Bon Jovi game compared to maybe like

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Six would buy the Journey themed game

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
You see what I'm saying?

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Go with a band that more people would probably buy

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Because it's a given

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
100% is not going to buy

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
A band themed game

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Because not everybody is behind them, you know?

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Here's the thing though

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
I think there are very, very, very few

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
And I know I've gotten into this on the show before

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
So you've probably heard this feel before

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
There are very, very few bands

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
And artists that

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Can justify an entire release

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
For their brand

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
And the Beatles were

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Certainly one of them

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Michael Jackson is another

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
And there's probably nobody else

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
In that top tier, to be honest

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
I don't think there is any other band or musical

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Act that fits into that same caliber

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
As Michael Jackson and the Beatles. None

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Now you go down to the next tier

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
And that's where you get your

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Bon Jovis and your

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Van Halen's and your

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Aerosmith and Metallica

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
But I don't even think

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Green Day fits into that tier

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Honestly, I was too fond of

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Green Day being in that tier

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
In that tier above. I don't even think

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Aerosmith was more deserving than Metallica

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
If you'll ask me, but that's just my opinion

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Right, and then it just

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Starts to get into opinions

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
But you just have to look at history, record sales

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
How many t-shirts of the band's name have been sold

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
I think Metallica

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
And Aerosmith are about even, it's just different

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Crowds. Pretty much

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
So, but I think

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
That very very top tier

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
There's nobody in it but the Beatles and Michael Jackson

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Nobody has that same kind of

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Pull. And now we see

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
What we're getting, I mean Michael Jackson

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Just never really worked right for a rock band

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Kind of set up, so now we see

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
What we're getting instead, which I don't know if

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
It's the best idea, but I won't see

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
For real until I get to play the game

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
I'm interested, I gotta say

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
I find the idea of a Michael Jackson

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Dance-y type just dance game

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
More appealing than some of the other dance

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Games I've seen

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Well, I mean, I've seen people

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Play, I think it's pretty fun. Me personally, if I'm gonna

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Sit there and play it, I'm gonna get the official

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Loafers and the glove and the jacket

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
And just rock out with my cock out, you know

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Hey, hold on there, Michael Jackson got in trouble

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
For that. Alright. Yeah, but I'm an

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Adult, so it's okay. Alright

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Alright, we gotta let you go buddy

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
But I appreciate the discussion, it was good

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Come on buddy. You too, later

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Later

GioVidea says, I want Billy Joel for rock band

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Hey, good news GioVidea, they're gonna do like

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
This huge Billy Joel track pack

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Keyboards and all

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I believe December-ish

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Early December-ish

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Is when it's coming, and I'm talking like

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
It's like ten songs, so

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
That should be very exciting, correct?

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
I don't know

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Should we go to more calls, or

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Last minute stories, or what are we gonna do here?

Yeah, sure, let's do that

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Okay, I'm trying to think

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Oh, this is kinda cool

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
I saw this actually

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
You know that game, Super Mario crossover

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Well of course they're doing another update

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
For it, and they're adding the blaster master

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Vehicle as

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
One of the characters you can play as

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Yeah, I saw that on the Twitter, somebody tweeted that

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
To us this week, I saw that, that's cool

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Yes, very very cool, so

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
That update is not yet live

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
But it will be coming soon though

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
I actually played a little bit of that game before

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
The show with the last update

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Ryu from Ninja Gaiden

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
So

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Very cool

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Alright, hold on, our phones are lighting up like all at once now

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Let me go take some calls, hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Who's this?

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Hi, this is Pazinator

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Hi everybody

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Yeah, a couple of things that I

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Didn't get around to tweeting to you

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
For

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
They're all kinda interrelated

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
First off

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Right off the top of my list

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
For those of us

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
That have access to a PlayStation 3

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
And the PlayStation Network

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
There's another

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Free anime

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Episode currently on the store

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
It's called

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Saigon the Complete Series Episode 1

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
The 60 Billion

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Double Dollar Man

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Hey, let me ask you this

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
How do you keep tabs on

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
All this free stuff that's coming out

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Is this you just checking the store kinda every Wednesday

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
When they do the updates, or is there like a blog

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
That kinda tracks all the free shit on

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
PSN

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
There's no blog that I'm aware of

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
That tracks all the free stuff

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
It's just that

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
I was like self-censoring, did you hear that?

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Yeah

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
I just hate to say it

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
But I got no life

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
And I'm constantly

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Checking things on the store

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
You know what, it's okay

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
When Game Room was still new and fresh

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
And the games were really notable

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Every Wednesday, I would plop on the couch

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
And run over and see what came out

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
And Virtual Console, it was new too

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
No worries, dude

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Yeah, I really won't

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Get into my opinion of

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
The free show cause

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Why I think of the show may differ from

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
What you or Jeannie or Loki

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Would think of the show

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
My own opinion

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Would probably be irrelevant

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Sum it up into one sentence

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Basically

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
It's a free show

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Even if you download it

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
And hate the show

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
It's free

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
That was a perfect sentence, Spaznator

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
It's a free show

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Perfect, perfect

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Alright

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
On a relaying note, for those of us

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
In our age group

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
That grew up with it

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
They just

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Start putting, of all things

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
He-Man and Masters of the Universe

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
On the PlayStation Network

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Dude, really? Is She-Ra up yet?

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Not yet

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
But at this rate, I'm wondering if it

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Goes up there soon

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
They don't have all the episodes

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Up yet, just 33

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
But damn, damn it all

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I, I grew up

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
You know, watching that show

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Religiously, I mean, you know

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Dad and Voltron and Transformers

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I mean, you know, I practically

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Had a orgasm once I realized

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
They went up on the store and

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Granted, you know, the first

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
One on the store was, you know, they had

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
A fail at the same time, 99 cents

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Each, you know, I grabbed

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
What I could afford and

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
I was blessed, sorry

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Only two episodes

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
But as soon as I came

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I'm gonna snatch up the rest

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
And, you know, if only

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
They put up like Gia, Joe

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
And the rest of the

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Episodes of Transformers

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
You know, season two and onward

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
You know, I'd be a

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Happy camper, you know?

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Hey, Gia Videa is saving the day for me and pointing out

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
That She-Ra is at least on Netflix

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
So you can get it on your PS3

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
You know, when they switch to digital

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
TV and stuff right here and we started getting all those weird

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
.2 channels

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
There is actually a channel, I don't remember what it's called now

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
But in the Sacramento area that plays

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Old cartoons like that

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
They even play the original Ghostbusters cartoon

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Not the 80s cartoon

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
But the one that actually predated the movies

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
You know, like from the 70s

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Uh, what, who's station

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Is that Fox's number two?

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I don't remember

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
It's not the more or

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
It, it

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
My friend actually watches

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
A lot of that stuff

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Voltron and stuff

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
One of them, the Fox affiliate here had a

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Second channel that was nothing

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
But music videos

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
It was like what MTV should have been

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
But that went away, it only lasted like four years

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
If you haven't checked it out

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Because not all cable companies pick them up

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Get your HDTV to search for signals in the area

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Because that's kind of part of the cool thing about HDTV

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Now your NBC station

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Only ever had one channel

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
But now they have like three or four

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Some of them

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
And some of them are weird, like we have this one, it's like

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
More TV Sacramento where they play these random movies

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Like these strangest movies out there

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Some of them are gonna be like Gospel

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
And some of them are nothing but the Weather Channel

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
But local, but there's some

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
You'll find some weird shit out there

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Sorry

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I can't really knock

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Because I never used it

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
So I can't really say anything positive or negative

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
About it until I use it

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
You know

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
The thing is with me

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
In order to use it I would have to get a credit card

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
I don't have one currently

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
So I'm basically stuck

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Buying things off of

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Either Xbox Live

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Zoom Marketplace

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Or TSN

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
And in a way

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
It kind of works out

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
In a way

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
It may be

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Kind of expensive

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Depending on how you look at

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Compared to other

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Ways of getting stuff

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
But at the same time

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
It's also cheaper

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
At least in the sense that

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
You can buy the stuff piecemeal

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Low over time

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Over an extended period of time

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
And not only that

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
But at least

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Compared to getting

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Stuff on BluRay

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Or DVD or whatever

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Where you're basically stuck

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Every episode of

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
One particular season

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Where you really only want

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Let's say an episode of

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Five of whatever series

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Well it's nice if nothing else

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
At least there's different options

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Out there

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Yeah

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Granted

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
TSN's not perfect

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
I've been on board

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
On the show multiple times complaining

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
About here and there

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
But at least

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
It's out there

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
It's something you can do at least

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Alright Spaznator we're going to let you go so we wrap up

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
The show but thanks so much for your call

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Really appreciate it

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Have a good one buddy

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Alright that's going to do it for the skype line tonight

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Sorry to those that didn't get through

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
And if you're sitting there going why is it always the same people

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Every week to get through on skype

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Because you're not calling us

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
So if you're mad at hearing the same people

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Every week you've got to give us a call

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
1-877-GAME-OL-R or remember there are

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Other ways you can interact with the show

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
If you're like shy and you're like I don't want any people

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
To hear my voice hehe

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Or you don't want your parents knowing that you're calling that's fine

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Give us an email mailbag at orange lounge radio

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Dot com we don't want you to get in trouble

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
You can also send us tweets

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
This is the show where every gamer has a voice

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
We want to make sure you are heard

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Anyhow any more last minute stories

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
We want to get to tonight Loki before we wrap things up

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Yeah one

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
One other thing here

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Halo Wars they're turning off the servers

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
December 15th I heard about that

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
So that sucks and the game's not that old

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Either and

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Apparently yeah

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Barely two years old Microsoft

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Is pulling the plug on Halo Wars

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Getting rid of the leaderboard and stat

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Tracking as well as the forums

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
They're just

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Throwing it all away aren't they

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
They are forums that expensive to maintain

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Really

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
It says community was informed that on Tuesday

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
They were also told that they were transitioning

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
To the Halo Waypoint forums

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Which is a nice way of saying

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
That halowars.com

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Is going away

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
So it says

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
More importantly the forums will disappear

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
And so will online stat tracking

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
And it says

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
I know this will be rough on a lot of you guys

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
This is from one of the forum mods

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
And here's some of the comments

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Game is dead. Fuck you. No stat tracking

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
You just killed this game. Fuck you

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
They are cheap bastards

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I'm buying this domain when they let it go lol

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
And it says possibly the most

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Close knit video game

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Forum community is going to be tossed

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
With a bunch of reach junkies

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Doh

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
So sad

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
So TigerClaw sent me this link he wanted me to play

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
For you Loki

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
You might recognize this

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Wow this is old

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
I was thinking about the ghostbusters

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
And the real ghostbusters but I didn't even

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Know there was this really old one

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
We used to watch this all the time

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
My little brothers loved it

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
And when we were really really little

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
We had this

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
It was a garage that had been converted to a

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Playroom and they'd take

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
This big chair and put a driving wheel in front

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Of it and try to beat the car

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Nice

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
JeremyTaw1 in our chat room is kind of pissed about

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
This story that Loki just reported on

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
I'm sorry but this whole server pulling thing

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Is bullshit. Someone pays 60 bucks

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
For a game should be able to play it online

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
For at least a few years without them

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Turning it off. Now here's the thing though

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
I don't think it says that they're taking down the online

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
They're taking down the leaderboards and stat tracking

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
All the frills that come on the website

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
I still think you can play online

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Because it's Microsoft's live servers

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
I can't imagine they'd take those down

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
What else do you pay for gold for?

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
The other quick thing I wanted to throw out here

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
That Tigerclaw had sent us

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Was about the video game awards on

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Spike TV. I guess the nominees have been announced

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
But I'm kind of like

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Are these really relevant?

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
The only reason why the video game awards

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Are really relevant at all

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Is that they show commercials for new games

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
And get new game announcements during the show

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
And I guess, I don't know

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
It kind of tries to bring this like

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Legitimacy quote unquote

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
To the video game scene but I'm just kind of like

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Eh, I don't need it

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
But for the record if you're curious what they nominated

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Game of the Year, Call of Duty Black Ops

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
God of War 3, Halo Reach, Mass Effect 2

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Red Dead Redemption

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Those are the nominees for Game of the Year

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Okay, no surprises there

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Any other last minute stories, Loki?

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
I think that's

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
About it

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Fan made Thief 2

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Multiplayer beta has been released

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
So if you're a fan of Thief 2

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
And wish that you could have played it with more than one person

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Then you might want to check it out

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Alright

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Well it's time for us to wrap up the show

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
And get on out of here for the night

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
And you know, so forth

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
So Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
For our listeners tonight?

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Money, I can have some?

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Pinkberry!

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Aw man, you just took mine, I was gonna say

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
My final thought is Pinkberry, can I have some?

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
But I'll just say

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Four day vacation, can I has it?

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Loki, your final thought tonight

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
My final thought

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Is

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
I get to make turkey

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Turducken?

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
No, it's just turkey

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Turducken's just too, I don't think that'd be too much

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
What are you doing, are you

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Since both you and the missus

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Have parents locally, you kind of have to do like

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Two thanksgivings at once, right?

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Not necessarily, we're just having our way over to our house

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Oh, smart

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Smart, alright, good luck with that this year

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Alright, that's it guys, we're

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Out of here, have a wonderful night

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
And we'll see you next week, hey if you enjoyed

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
The show tonight, all we ask guys

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Tell a couple people about the show

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Tell folks that you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
And help us spread the word, because you know guys

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
We don't have a huge website, we're not part

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Of a gaming magazine or anything like that

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
We rely on word of mouth, so

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Tell a couple people about the show, and if you think you've told

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Everyone you can already, then please

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Consider leaving us a nice review on iTunes

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
A five star review goes a long way in helping us

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Get the word out and more exposure on the network

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Really appreciate it guys

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Have a wonderful night and we'll see you next time

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Next week here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Have a wonderful Thanksgiving to those of you in the

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
US that celebrate it, to everyone else

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Well have a great week and we'll see you on Sunday

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
You've been listening to

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
