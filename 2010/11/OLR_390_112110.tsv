10000	12000	Sky and Loki

16000	19000	Layoffs and downsizing hit four game studios
19000	22000	Developers pay a premium to create the 3DS
22000	26000	And did Nintendo give away a prototype version of a classic game?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	36000	And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	39000	The video game podcast where every gamer has a voice
39000	42000	We do tape live and for all the information to listen to us live
42000	46000	Visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com
46000	48000	We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening
48000	50000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
50000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts
52000	54000	I'll be working with you over the next few hours with my co-host
54000	56000	The one and only Dark Sakura
56000	57000	Hi
57000	58000	Hi, how are you? Dark Sakura?
58000	59000	Jamie Summers
59000	60000	I'm alright
60000	61000	Happiest bunny on the farm?
61000	63000	You seem like a little bit of a sad bunny tonight
63000	65000	I am a little bit of a sad bunny but it's alright
65000	66000	Do you want a hug? I'll come give you a hug
66000	68000	I prefer the chocolate ones, thank you
68000	70000	You need candy
70000	73000	Alright, well I hope some discussion on video games will help brighten your spirits
73000	77000	You know, I had a terra-bad week this week
77000	79000	I mean, it was really awful
79000	81000	Was it bigger than a giga-bad?
81000	83000	It was a terra-bad, actually
83000	85000	That's what I was saying
85000	87000	It was
87000	89000	Yeah, but I did the other show
89000	91000	Because now I'm juggling two shows just like you
91000	93000	And that actually put me in a lot better mood
93000	95000	So podcasting hopefully will brighten your spirits
95000	96000	We'll see
96000	98000	Cool, I was watching V before you came over
98000	100000	New V or old V?
100000	101000	New V
101000	103000	I stopped about halfway on new V
103000	105000	Not because I hated it
105000	107000	It was hard for me to watch TV every week
107000	109000	I caught up on Supernatural so I was just sitting
109000	111000	Marathon-ing stuff because I didn't feel like doing anything
111000	115000	I heard a lot of people that kind of like watch TV while they play games
115000	119000	A friend of mine on the WoW guild was telling me about how he was leveling to 80
119000	121000	While watching Arrested Development on Netflix
121000	122000	Fun
122000	123000	So, yeah, good times
123000	126000	Alright, say hello as well to somebody who will hopefully make us laugh tonight
126000	127000	If not, he's fired
127000	128000	No, just kidding
128000	129000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki
129000	130000	Hello
130000	131000	How are you, Loki?
131000	132000	I'm fine
132000	133000	Alright, what's new in your world?
133000	134000	Anything new, fun going on?
134000	136000	Not much, just eating bad for me pizza
136000	137000	Alright, is your mic even on?
137000	139000	We are having a real hard time hearing you tonight
139000	140000	Did you plug me in the wrong hole again?
140000	141000	No, you're good
141000	143000	I just, we just had to get you angry in order to hear you, I think
143000	144000	No?
144000	146000	I don't, it's very quiet
146000	148000	It's very, very quiet
148000	150000	Live radio, some of the perks
150000	151000	We'll try and fix his stuff all in one
151000	153000	Fix me now!
153000	155000	No, you're definitely fixed now, alright
157000	159000	Everybody's just all quiet and somber tonight
159000	161000	Must be the weather
161000	162000	The weather changing is
162000	164000	I call it complete and utter apathy
164000	167000	Last night was, was it thunder, I was in the bay
167000	169000	But it was thunderstorming, like crazy
169000	170000	It was fantastic
170000	172000	It was a light the candles type of day
172000	175000	I love rain, I love rain a lot
175000	178000	But the whole problem with rain is that it makes me intensely homesick
178000	180000	And also nobody can drive in the rain
180000	181000	Is the other big problem
181000	182000	Nobody from here
182000	184000	No, yeah, big problem with the rain
184000	186000	Alright, if you've never listened to Orange Launch Radio before
186000	188000	I haven't given this spiel in a while, so I'll just say hello
188000	191000	If you've never listened to our show before, we do tape live
191000	194000	And the three of us here, Dark Soccer, myself and Loki
194000	196000	We all met playing video games at the local arcade
196000	198000	It was Dance Dance Revolution, ironically enough
198000	200000	Was the game that brought us together
200000	202000	So for a long time we did a show about music games
202000	204000	And, well, things evolve, things change
204000	206000	And now we're podcasting about all the video games that are out there
206000	209000	From the classics, Atari 2600, NES, Sega
209000	212000	All the way to the new stuff on the PS3 and 360
212000	215000	We like to talk about the news and talk about it with you guys
215000	217000	Cause, you know, we, we know you guys are smart
217000	219000	You go on game blogs, if you subscribe to this show
219000	221000	You probably read the big game blogs
221000	223000	You already know a lot of the news
223000	225000	But we like to talk about it and discuss it
225000	226000	And get your perspective
226000	228000	And to do that we always have the present fourth guest on our show
228000	231000	The chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com
231000	233000	But of course we're also gonna take calls later in the show
233000	236000	There's our Twitter, our Facebook, and all that fun stuff
236000	239000	But we do always start off the show with a little bit of
239000	241000	How was your gaming week where we talk about the video games
241000	242000	You've been playing this week
242000	244000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
244000	248000	Um, kind of, not much of anything
248000	253000	I played Star Trek Online for like an hour this week
253000	257000	And, yeah, oh, Angry Birds
257000	259000	The game is retarded and fun
259000	262000	Why do you think so many people are into Angry Birds on the iPhone?
262000	265000	Like, I have to admit, it's not a game that's ever really interested me
265000	267000	But it seems like everybody is playing this game
267000	269000	Because pigs aren't kosher
269000	271000	Okay
271000	273000	You just, you fight evil pigs
273000	274000	Oh, I see, I see
274000	275000	And they're not kosher
275000	277000	So I kill them
277000	279000	By toppling bricks on top of them
279000	281000	Until they poof and die
281000	284000	And they get all beat up and bruised beforehand
284000	285000	So it's really great
285000	286000	And you've got chickens that explode
286000	288000	Poor piggies that can't defend themselves
288000	290000	Aw
290000	294000	Um, well they're idiot pigs anyway
294000	296000	Um
296000	300000	Maybe that'll be the sequel to Angry Birds, idiot pigs
300000	304000	I found my Digimon
304000	307000	It's way dead, but I found my old school Digimon
307000	308000	Was that, did they actually
308000	310000	The brick looking ones
310000	312000	Like, that were like the Tamagotchis?
312000	313000	Yeah, but they could connect
313000	315000	I never knew they had those
315000	317000	I always thought Digimon was just like a Gameboy game
317000	318000	Well, and an anime
318000	321000	Yeah, but they were actually made from
321000	324000	I think the same company that did the Tamagotchi
324000	325000	Or something like that
325000	328000	But anyway, you could connect the two end to end
328000	330000	And they would battle
330000	332000	And uh
332000	335000	It finally is dead, we finally just got rid of it
335000	336000	We cleaned out a lot of stuff in the house
336000	339000	I was gonna say, the battery must have given out after all this time
339000	342000	You leave a battery in something way too long
342000	344000	Then it just goes bad
344000	346000	Um
346000	350000	We've got rid of a lot of stuff
350000	354000	But we're also sitting aside, I guess, some swag for people
354000	356000	I guess
356000	358000	And
358000	359000	Yeah, that's about it
359000	360000	Oh, we picked a Brad Racer
360000	362000	Did I say that already last week?
362000	364000	I don't remember
364000	367000	Did you get some Elite 3D glasses to go with it?
367000	368000	No
368000	371000	No
371000	373000	And uh
373000	374000	Yeah, that's about it
374000	375000	That's really about it
375000	376000	Alright
376000	378000	Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing this week?
378000	379000	Um
379000	380000	Not as much as I was going to
380000	383000	But I played basically Grand Theft Auto
383000	385000	And some of the Kinect stuff
385000	388000	Like I was demonstrating the Kinect things for a few of my
388000	390000	Fellow employees
390000	392000	So a little bit of Kinect Adventures
392000	394000	Which is
394000	396000	You know, not surprisingly
396000	398000	Very boring, you know
398000	402000	So many times I can play the River Rafting game
402000	404000	Or even the other games in there without going
404000	406000	Eh, whatever
406000	408000	I've been playing more Dance Central
408000	410000	Which is pretty fun
410000	412000	Playing some of the more difficult songs
412000	414000	Which aren't that difficult
414000	416000	But it's just different
416000	418000	So I was playing Jungle Boogie a little bit
418000	420000	And um
420000	422000	Yeah, more Grand Theft Auto
422000	424000	That's pretty much it
424000	426000	I've played some of the iPhones
426000	428000	You know, iPod stuff
428000	430000	But uh
430000	432000	Not really anything worth mentioning
432000	434000	Just like, you know, I've played a few games of
434000	436000	You know, the Stick Wars stuff
436000	438000	Um
438000	440000	I haven't got a chance to play Rage yet
440000	442000	Um, because I went
442000	444000	Downloaded it
444000	446000	Synced it with my iTunes
446000	448000	And somehow it deleted the game
448000	450000	Off my iPod
450000	452000	And in iTunes I'm like
452000	454000	And I also have Lego Harry Potter
454000	456000	Where I haven't played that yet either
456000	458000	Is that the one that's supposed to use Kinect?
458000	460000	Like, I knew there was a Harry Potter game that uses Kinect in some fashion
460000	462000	No, Lego Harry Potter, it's the one on
462000	464000	The iOS stuff
464000	466000	Oh, I'm sorry, you're still on iOS
466000	468000	No, no, no
468000	470000	There's a Harry Potter in Deathly Hallows Part 1
470000	472000	Okay, that's what I was thinking
472000	474000	And it has like a little on rail shooter portion
474000	476000	That you can use Kinect for
476000	478000	But apparently it's really dumb
478000	480000	Well, it's early
480000	482000	Tech demos turned into games
482000	484000	It's still tacked on
484000	486000	Hey, you know what, it's better than nothing
486000	488000	You know, they could have just done nothing
488000	490000	Do you find yourself
490000	492000	Yourself still playing
492000	494000	Kinect a couple weeks later?
494000	496000	Because I kind of stopped
496000	498000	Um, yeah, Dance Central
498000	500000	I've actually been playing Dance Central
500000	502000	It's pretty fun actually
502000	504000	And funny enough, I got some of my other employees into it
504000	506000	They were like really
506000	508000	It was surprising
508000	510000	I didn't think they would try Dance Central
510000	512000	I had one of my co-workers playing Just Dance
512000	514000	This guy, you know
514000	516000	Purple Belt and Tae Kwon Do
516000	518000	And stuff
518000	520000	Just not
520000	522000	The person that would be playing
522000	524000	That song
524000	526000	You know what, there's no shame in having fun
526000	528000	No, not at all
528000	530000	Even if the song's a little fruity, it's fun
530000	532000	He thought it was hilarious, so
532000	534000	Yeah, it's fun
534000	536000	The problem really is
536000	538000	I don't have room to play it
538000	540000	So I play it at work
540000	542000	We have our game room
542000	544000	I guess, it's in a conference room
544000	546000	So I take the conference room table that's split in two
546000	548000	And I push one to one end of the wall
548000	550000	One to the other end of the wall
550000	552000	And it gives me a good ten feet
552000	554000	By ten feet space that I can actually play in
554000	556000	You don't know how lucky you are to be able to turn
556000	558000	In your conference room at work into like
558000	560000	A gaming hotspot, it's amazing
560000	562000	To me
562000	564000	Yeah, I guess
564000	566000	That's part of the deal
566000	568000	I guess, so
568000	570000	Anything else?
570000	572000	Yeah, that's pretty much it
572000	574000	I had a pretty dramatic week
574000	576000	In World of Warcraft
576000	578000	I won't get into all the details
578000	580000	The good news is I don't have to subject you guys
580000	582000	Now that I have the spin-off show, I don't have to subject you guys to all the talk anymore
582000	584000	But I'll say it was a very traumatic week
584000	586000	Because my authenticator reset itself
586000	588000	Yeah, I don't know how it happened either
588000	590000	But I had to make a phone call to Blizzard and all that
590000	592000	At least you didn't swallow yours
592000	594000	No, what happened?
594000	596000	Some person swallowed their authenticator
596000	598000	No, mine's on my iPhone
598000	600000	And somehow it just reset
600000	602000	And I couldn't restore it from backup
602000	604000	None of it would work
604000	606000	It would just give me the new serial number
606000	608000	And you can't input your own serial number
608000	610000	So, it was weird
610000	612000	And then Wednesday, my guild got the first
612000	614000	Kill of the Lich King ever
614000	616000	But I wasn't there because I had to drop out of the raid
616000	618000	Because Comcast kept cutting out on me
618000	620000	And so, yep, wasn't there
620000	622000	So anyway, I won't get into all the details about it
622000	624000	It's on the other show, Horde House now
624000	626000	That's kind of odd
626000	628000	Now I don't get to go on these long Warcraft tangents on the show anymore
628000	630000	You can still go on the tangents
630000	632000	Now I feel like I'm spent, I already went on that tangent
632000	634000	I don't want to do it again
634000	636000	So yeah, it was an interesting week in Warcraft
636000	638000	But let me talk about other games, because there were other games I was playing as well
638000	640000	Maybe I wasn't playing the Kinect games so much
640000	642000	But I did kind of go on this demo downloading
642000	644000	Binge of stuff I've just kind of missed on
644000	646000	One of those games I checked out was
646000	648000	Super Meat Boy
648000	650000	Which, actually was kind of cool
650000	652000	Like, the demo is very robust for that game
652000	656000	I get the sense it's a flash game that's been converted somehow
656000	658000	But there's a lot, well it's Newgrounds
658000	660000	So that was kind of a sign right there
660000	662000	But it had a surprising amount of depth to it
662000	664000	One of the mechanics I really liked is that
664000	666000	You know, you're on this Mario style map
666000	668000	Doing all the little challenges
668000	670000	But when you get an A plus on a level
670000	672000	Meaning you beat the level within the par time
672000	674000	You can hit a button to go to the dark side
674000	676000	And you can hit a button to go to the dark side
676000	678000	You can hit a button to go to the dark world
678000	680000	Where you play the stage again
680000	682000	And it's like the exact same map
682000	684000	Only harder
684000	686000	Like maybe there will be more saw blades out now
686000	688000	Or more enemies
688000	690000	So I thought that was kind of a neat mechanic
690000	692000	And one of the things I really like
692000	694000	Is that the game plays very fast
694000	696000	Every stage is meant to be beat in like under a minute
696000	698000	And some of them are literally like 10 seconds long
698000	700000	So it's almost like micro games
700000	702000	But you might have to play the round
702000	704000	Like, not even kidding
704000	706000	50 times
706000	708000	To get the rhythm just right
708000	710000	To time that jump just right
710000	712000	So you can kind of get through the gap
712000	714000	And do like a jump around
714000	716000	You know what I mean when you jump to the right
716000	718000	And then push control over the left to get around an obstacle
718000	720000	You know, you kind of do all these weird sorts of things
720000	722000	But what I like is that when you finally beat the level
722000	724000	You get to see an instant replay
724000	726000	But the instant replay isn't just
726000	728000	The replay of you beating it
728000	730000	It's the replay of every single attempt you made
730000	732000	At the level all at once
732000	734000	And you'll see like 50 little meat guys
734000	736000	All jumping and you see them all dying
736000	738000	It's actually really clever
738000	740000	And a really neat game mechanic
740000	742000	And I'm sure I've got to have seen this somewhere before
742000	744000	But I can't think of anything
744000	746000	So I was very surprised at what a robust demo it was
746000	748000	And I was very pleased with it
748000	750000	And I do plan on buying the full game
750000	752000	I would have never guessed this was a game that interests me
752000	754000	Because I'm going to be honest
754000	756000	And this is going to sound really weird
756000	758000	And I should be made fun of for this
758000	760000	And I'm okay with that
760000	762000	But the gameplay and the artwork
762000	764000	Of like that red case with the weird
764000	766000	Funny green toothy thing
766000	768000	Made me, honestly
768000	770000	I kind of looked at it and went, what's this super meat
770000	772000	That sounds stupid
772000	774000	That game sounds stupid, that looks stupid
774000	776000	It's kind of amazing how much judgement
776000	778000	I passed on this game, really not knowing dick about it
778000	780000	And I was wrong
780000	782000	I can admit that
782000	784000	But at the same time
784000	786000	I was a little kind of turned off by
786000	788000	Why didn't you try to like
788000	790000	I don't know, put a little more
790000	792000	Into the retro
792000	794000	Jokes like on the box art
794000	796000	Or something, like that whole like red gritting
796000	798000	Face just was a little silly to me
798000	800000	I don't know, I'm sure
800000	802000	I'm not even looking at chat because I'm sure I'm being
802000	804000	Taunted for being irrational right now
804000	806000	But it did kind of make me step back and go
806000	808000	Wow, you do kind of put a lot of thought
808000	810000	Into even like what's on the front
810000	812000	Of a box
812000	814000	As to whether I'll pull it off the shelf
814000	816000	And I realize this is all happening virtually
816000	818000	I'll pull it off the shelf and read the back of the box
818000	820000	So, kind of interesting
820000	822000	So again if you want to go
822000	824000	Chat.orangelaunchradio.com you can join us
824000	826000	Okay now I'm being brave and reading it there
826000	828000	Um
828000	830000	Let's see, uh
830000	832000	Sorry I'm reading this live here
832000	834000	Dark Tetsuya says
834000	836000	Don't forget Alien Hominid was a Newgrounds
836000	838000	Game too, that's true, that was kind of a cool game
838000	840000	The Castle Crashers, was that a Newgrounds?
840000	842000	It was the very same style
842000	844000	Very similar style
844000	846000	Only Hemeth did that and they had done
846000	848000	Alien Hominid, I think that's the deal
848000	850000	They've done Alien Hominid, yeah
850000	852000	So
852000	854000	So I played that and I definitely want to pick up the full
854000	856000	Version of that, I also played Pac-Man Championship
856000	858000	Edition DX
858000	860000	Which I thought was kind of a worthy
860000	862000	Upgrade based on the demo I played
862000	864000	You know, more maps
864000	866000	Different skins looking thing
866000	868000	But they also made a couple big changes to the mechanic
868000	870000	That make it worthy of an upgrade, one of them is
870000	872000	Bombs, which I know sounds very weird for a Pac-Man
872000	874000	Game, but how often
874000	876000	In Pac-Man do you get trapped in a corner
876000	878000	Where there's a ghost coming one way and there's
878000	880000	A ghost coming the other way and you're like, oh shit
880000	882000	I'm fucked, now I realize that's the whole point
882000	884000	Of Pac-Man, but this being a sequel
884000	886000	You get to try new things, so now you have
886000	888000	A bomb and you can hit this bomb and it
888000	890000	Blows the ghost out of your way
890000	892000	So you can get through, it's
892000	894000	A simple thing that kind of adds
894000	896000	A whole new level to it, I don't want to say it makes it easier
896000	898000	But now you can
898000	900000	Get yourself in different situations
900000	902000	Than you were able to before, if that makes sense
902000	904000	The other thing that's kind of cool
904000	906000	About the game is that you have these like
906000	908000	Sleeping ghosts, we'll say
908000	910000	These ghosts that just stand in place and don't do anything
910000	912000	Until you go right next to them
912000	914000	And once you go right next to them
914000	916000	They'll wake up and start to chase you
916000	918000	But they chase you in a very
918000	920000	Logical pattern, like they just keep following you
920000	922000	And if you do this right
922000	924000	You'll get like 30 ghosts
924000	926000	All in a row, and then pick up a power pellet
926000	928000	And you'll just go chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp
928000	930000	And you'll just rack up a high score there
930000	932000	So I thought that was kind of a neat new
932000	934000	Mechanic, so just a couple new little twists
934000	936000	Kind of breeze fresh life
936000	938000	Into a game and I thought it was pretty awesome
938000	940000	And the music was really cool
940000	942000	So yeah, I gotta say
942000	944000	I haven't read on the net
944000	946000	What the reception is to this game, I don't know if people
946000	948000	Are saying unnecessary copy or whatever
948000	950000	But I gotta admit, I find the
950000	952000	Few little twists
952000	954000	To really kind of bring new life
954000	956000	Into what was otherwise a game that you know
956000	958000	Was, you know, it's been on the iPhone
958000	960000	And the Xbox
960000	962000	You know, we've kind of seen it
962000	964000	Several times over the past few years, so
964000	966000	I thought that was cool, so
966000	968000	Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandsreader.com
968000	970000	Salacious Pop says, it's amazing
970000	972000	The music alone, if you use a bomb
972000	974000	On a chain of 40 plus ghosts and they all fly back
974000	976000	Into the base, it's a very epic satisfying
976000	978000	Feeling, that's very true
978000	980000	I agree with that
980000	982000	Black Wolf is clarifying an earlier comment I was saying
982000	984000	Castle Crashers used Newgrounds for the music
984000	986000	At least, that makes sense
986000	988000	There was, definitely
988000	990000	A lot of those games have the same look
990000	992000	And feel and so forth
992000	994000	Another game I checked out on Xbox Live
994000	996000	Again, these are all demos and I always feel weird
996000	998000	About reviewing demos, but a lot of these were very
998000	1000000	Robust, and I think
1000000	1002000	Still
1002000	1004000	When you're gonna put a demo of your game
1004000	1006000	Out there, you're kind of putting
1006000	1008000	It out there to be, to have
1008000	1010000	Your entire game judged, should I drop
1010000	1012000	$10 on this, yes or no
1012000	1014000	I feel somewhat justified in that
1014000	1016000	Salacious Pop is reminding me
1016000	1018000	I also played Guang
1018000	1020000	Guangi?
1020000	1022000	I don't even know how to pronounce this game, but I did play that
1022000	1024000	On Xbox Live, and
1024000	1026000	I know we have a really diehard
1026000	1028000	Shmup fan in the chatroom that's gonna really hate me
1028000	1030000	For this, but I didn't get it, I didn't get it at all
1030000	1032000	I liked that it was
1032000	1034000	Different, but I didn't understand
1034000	1036000	What the hell I was doing, it was just bullets everywhere
1036000	1038000	Ahh!
1038000	1040000	Apparently there's reskinned modes, but they're not really in the demo
1040000	1042000	It was just the first level of the arcade game that was in the demo
1042000	1044000	I had no idea what the eff I was doing
1044000	1046000	You know, not being the big
1046000	1048000	It seems like a lot of the
1048000	1050000	Cave shooters that they're bringing over
1050000	1052000	No offense, it's like
1052000	1054000	You could like
1054000	1056000	Randomly show me different, you know
1056000	1058000	Video from a bunch of different ones
1058000	1060000	They all look the same
1060000	1062000	Well, but to be fair, Loki, this game wasn't
1062000	1064000	The same, and that was kind of what
1064000	1066000	I will say I liked about it, because
1066000	1068000	What was cool about it is that
1068000	1070000	For one, this character I was playing
1070000	1072000	You didn't just fire bullets, but you had a
1072000	1074000	Wolf that you moved around the screen
1074000	1076000	And bombs would fire from
1076000	1078000	The wolf or something, I don't know
1078000	1080000	But it was a different mechanic
1080000	1082000	So it didn't make it feel like every other shoot-em-up
1082000	1084000	So I don't think you can say every shoot-em-up
1084000	1086000	Is the same, it's just that
1086000	1088000	Because maybe I was
1088000	1090000	Expecting to understand it
1090000	1092000	Because I played a lot of other shoot-em-ups
1092000	1094000	It was really confusing to me
1094000	1096000	At first, but I don't know
1096000	1098000	I don't know
1098000	1100000	Um
1100000	1102000	Anyhow, that was
1102000	1104000	That was the game
1104000	1106000	If I spent more time with it, I'd probably enjoy it
1106000	1108000	Or if I was more of a fan of the
1108000	1110000	Shoot-em-up games, and really understood
1110000	1112000	What was so different
1112000	1114000	I should have spent more time with it, really
1114000	1116000	But again, demos were supposed to sell me on the full games
1116000	1118000	And after playing the demos I did
1118000	1120000	This week, I'm like, I'm more interested in going back
1120000	1122000	And playing more Super Meat Boy, which I never thought
1122000	1124000	I'd say a couple weeks ago
1124000	1126000	They have that
1126000	1128000	To internets on there and stuff
1128000	1130000	That they unlock new levels
1130000	1132000	Every now and
1132000	1134000	Every once in a while without sort of
1134000	1136000	Updates, I guess
1136000	1138000	Did you say Super Meat Boy? Oh, no
1138000	1140000	I wasn't aware of that, that's cool
1140000	1142000	It seemed like there was a lot of
1142000	1144000	People
1144000	1146000	Ray in our chat room is a little irritated
1146000	1148000	At what Loki just said
1148000	1150000	I could say the same of any genre
1150000	1152000	All MMOs are the same
1152000	1154000	All genre are the same
1154000	1156000	Yeah, but I'm saying that the actual artwork
1156000	1158000	Looks very similar game to game
1158000	1160000	I'm not saying all shooters are the same
1160000	1162000	That doesn't make any sense
1162000	1164000	I'm saying that these games play very much alike
1164000	1166000	Like, I played a bunch of different cave shooters
1166000	1168000	And they play very similar
1168000	1170000	I'm telling you, this doesn't play like the other ones
1170000	1172000	Oh, big deal
1172000	1174000	It's a different thing that they added in there
1174000	1176000	It was different
1176000	1178000	Because you could kind of
1178000	1180000	Fire at the bullets and stuff
1180000	1182000	I don't think
1182000	1184000	People should pass judgment so quickly
1184000	1186000	It's still fun, I'm just saying
1186000	1188000	At least try it out
1188000	1190000	They're not like night and day
1190000	1192000	It's not like comparing
1192000	1194000	A Gradius game with
1194000	1196000	Ikaruga or something like that
1196000	1198000	Two games that have very different
1198000	1200000	Looks to them
1200000	1202000	Maybe similar
1202000	1204000	Types of gameplay, obviously
1204000	1206000	Ikaruga would be a lot harder
1206000	1208000	I don't know
1208000	1210000	Maybe it's just because they're all done with spray
1210000	1212000	Animation and stuff like that
1212000	1214000	It just seems very
1214000	1216000	Similar
1216000	1218000	You could show me one of those games and be like
1218000	1220000	Oh man, that was a cave shooter
1220000	1222000	I don't know
1222000	1224000	I don't get it
1224000	1226000	Why even bother having any storylines in it?
1226000	1228000	There's no point, really
1228000	1230000	And the last demo I played was for
1230000	1232000	King of Fighters 2002
1232000	1234000	Which, um
1234000	1236000	I didn't get it
1236000	1238000	I actually played the Neo Geo fighting franchises
1238000	1240000	Past Fatal Fury Special
1240000	1242000	I think was about the last one
1242000	1244000	With the exception of Capcom vs SNK
1244000	1246000	Which is still amazing
1246000	1248000	The problem is the demo only limits you to
1248000	1250000	A handful of characters
1250000	1252000	None of which I recognized
1252000	1254000	And all I did was I button masked
1254000	1256000	The chick with the whip
1256000	1258000	And I think her name was actually Whip
1258000	1260000	Yes, her name is Whip
1260000	1262000	And she's on Team Ikari
1262000	1264000	Very creative
1264000	1266000	No, she's actually a really cool character
1266000	1268000	And if you're good with her, she's really effective
1268000	1270000	But I always use Leona
1270000	1272000	But who you can't pick in the demo, I don't think
1272000	1274000	I would have recognized her, so I don't know
1274000	1276000	I didn't get a good feel for that one from the demo
1276000	1278000	She was on the same team with Leona, Clark, Ralph
1278000	1280000	Haytern
1280000	1282000	She's, I guess, Ikari themed
1282000	1284000	In the one I played, you were picking teams
1284000	1286000	You were picking individuals
1286000	1288000	But I'm saying that her story
1288000	1290000	Her character comes from the whole Ikari team
1290000	1292000	Alright
1292000	1294000	That's awesome
1294000	1296000	They did a Marvel vs. Capcom game
1296000	1298000	But Capcom vs. SNK
1298000	1300000	Do it in that style again
1300000	1302000	Now I know that they've had Capcom vs. SNK
1302000	1304000	1 and 2 and stuff
1304000	1306000	But the crazy over the top style
1306000	1308000	That is Marvel vs. Capcom
1308000	1310000	Would be awesome
1310000	1312000	Because I'm sorry
1312000	1314000	Just plain as the Metal Slug characters
1314000	1316000	I know they have
1316000	1318000	An SNK game that came out
1318000	1320000	I think it's already out
1320000	1322000	In Xbox Live Arcade
1322000	1324000	That's a port of an arcade game
1324000	1326000	It's like Neo Geo
1326000	1328000	Battle Colosseum
1328000	1330000	That has a bunch of those different characters
1330000	1332000	But it's just not
1332000	1334000	It's not as cool as
1334000	1336000	Or fast as
1336000	1338000	Marvel vs. Capcom or something
1338000	1340000	So that's pretty much all the games
1340000	1342000	I played this week that are worth mentioning
1342000	1344000	Although I did play Knights of the Clicky
1344000	1346000	Clicky Vampire Sorority Life
1346000	1348000	Farm Town Wars
1348000	1350000	That too
1350000	1352000	It's so sad
1352000	1354000	Facebook games really are the future
1354000	1356000	And there's really no depth to this game
1356000	1358000	But aren't the boss fights really cool?
1358000	1360000	They do these little cut scenes and stuff
1360000	1362000	That makes the whole game worth it to me
1362000	1364000	They're alright, you're in my party
1364000	1366000	You're shaking your head disapprovingly Loki
1366000	1368000	You don't like Knights of the Clicky Vampire
1368000	1370000	I haven't played it
1370000	1372000	And I'm not going to play it
1372000	1374000	I support you in that, it's fine
1374000	1376000	I really should not play that
1376000	1378000	Because if people support games like that
1378000	1380000	They're just going to keep making games like that
1380000	1382000	Well I don't give them money, and I will not give them money
1382000	1384000	And Alan always teases me
1384000	1386000	Like, you know you want to buy Squeenix coins
1386000	1388000	Just to get yourself this stupid armor
1388000	1390000	No! No no no no
1390000	1392000	And he knows how I feel
1392000	1394000	No, I'm not spending money
1394000	1396000	Rob, I have to go do something
1396000	1398000	Orange lunch foodie-o related
1398000	1400000	Make some orange soup
1400000	1402000	My soup is orange
1402000	1404000	And what's the soup of the day?
1404000	1406000	Actually it's soup that I made
1406000	1408000	It's soup that I made
1408000	1410000	Butternut squash sweet potato pumpkin soup
1410000	1412000	With curry and ginger spices
1412000	1416000	With shaved onion zucchini and squash in it
1416000	1418000	And I made it, it's delicious
1418000	1420000	Thanksgiving is definitely right around the corner
1420000	1422000	It is, and we have to roast a turkey
1422000	1424000	We haven't done turkey before
1424000	1426000	Are you doing the dinner this year?
1426000	1428000	No, but we have to contribute another turkey
1428000	1430000	So I'm making the stuffing for it
1430000	1432000	And I have a total recipe in my head
1432000	1434000	For cranberry apple stuffing
1434000	1436000	Cornbread stuffing
1436000	1438000	Because cornbread stuffing is the best
1438000	1440000	I'm officially sick of bacon pizza by the way
1440000	1442000	I noticed you did not bring bacon pizza
1442000	1444000	To the show tonight, it was like mushroomy pizza
1444000	1446000	Or was it actually bacon?
1446000	1448000	No, that is bacon pizza
1448000	1450000	They burnt the crap out of it
1450000	1452000	Yeah, thank you
1452000	1454000	That does not look appetizing
1454000	1456000	And I actually asked for quadruple bacon pizza
1456000	1458000	But she's like, triple bacon?
1458000	1460000	I don't think they understand more than three
1460000	1462000	If anyone wants that, I'm not worrying that for you
1462000	1464000	Um, no, it's
1464000	1466000	It's a little much, it's very heavy
1466000	1468000	I believe Loki is finally admitting
1468000	1470000	There is such a thing as too much bacon
1470000	1472000	No, it's just because
1472000	1474000	I didn't have the correct dipping sauce
1474000	1476000	I wanted a side of ranch
1476000	1478000	Well, ranch in round table speak
1478000	1480000	Is the creamy garlic sauce
1480000	1482000	The white sauce that they put on pizzas
1482000	1484000	But some round tables decide
1484000	1486000	Hey, you know what, we're gonna get some shitty ranch
1486000	1488000	We're also gonna call that ranch
1488000	1490000	Or creamy garlic sauce as well
1490000	1492000	And it's just not as good
1492000	1494000	Now if I had that, it would be so much better
1494000	1496000	What you should tell them is that next time
1496000	1498000	That they make it, is to put your bacon on first
1498000	1500000	And then put the cheese on top of it
1500000	1502000	So that the bacon won't burn
1502000	1504000	Because the oil from the cheese will saturate the bacon
1504000	1506000	And prevent it from burning
1506000	1508000	It's like our own little Paula Deen right here in the studio
1508000	1510000	It's not so bad even with the burnt bacon
1510000	1512000	It's just, it's too much
1512000	1514000	I cook
1514000	1516000	Don't look at me like that, cause I love Paula Deen
1516000	1518000	She's a frightening looking lady
1518000	1520000	Because she totally looks
1520000	1522000	Both botoxed and surgicaled
1522000	1524000	And still looks
1524000	1526000	Really scary old with those
1526000	1528000	Overly
1528000	1530000	Terrified looking eyes
1530000	1532000	Paula Deen is like the Cher
1532000	1534000	And you're like the Christina Aguilera
1534000	1536000	It's because she's preserved her body
1536000	1538000	With all that fat that she
1538000	1540000	Takes in
1540000	1542000	I mean, my god, she's like
1542000	1544000	I need to put a stick of butter in this one
1544000	1546000	Put a stick of butter in there
1546000	1548000	I seem to recall this was a video game podcast
1548000	1550000	I don't really remember
1550000	1552000	This is getting back to video games
1552000	1554000	I'm just going to make my dinner
1554000	1556000	I'm just saying that I'm probably going to stick to like
1556000	1558000	Cheese pizza or the twist
1558000	1560000	The twists are damn good
1560000	1562000	You know, have you thought about maybe like a salad?
1562000	1564000	I don't like salad
1564000	1566000	I've tried salad on multiple occasions
1566000	1568000	The only salad that I can tolerate
1568000	1570000	Is like a Caesar salad
1570000	1572000	And even then, I know that's way not good for me
1572000	1574000	I just do not like the taste of
1574000	1576000	Plants, okay
1576000	1578000	It's just, it feels very unnatural
1578000	1580000	It's like a cow trying to tap dance
1580000	1582000	It just, it doesn't feel natural
1582000	1584000	Eating plants, what do you think our ancestors
1584000	1586000	Had to do back in the day?
1586000	1588000	Well, we've evolved past that now, okay
1588000	1590000	Why do I have to eat the damn plants?
1590000	1592000	The animals that I'm eating right now
1592000	1594000	Have eaten those plants
1594000	1596000	Alright, look, we gotta get into
1596000	1598000	And since the pigs, they probably ate garbage too
1598000	1600000	But you know what?
1600000	1602000	I'm not going to eat garbage
1602000	1604000	Alright
1604000	1606000	Housekeeping, before we get into news
1606000	1608000	We will still have a show next week
1608000	1610000	I know the holidays are canceling some of your favorite
1610000	1612000	Podcasts, but thankfully, Sunday
1612000	1614000	Is kind of a nice day to be on
1614000	1616000	So we will still be bringing you new shows
1616000	1618000	Tonight, obviously, and next week
1618000	1620000	We're not going to have any time off for the holidays
1620000	1622000	We're working hard for you guys
1622000	1624000	Because we love you
1624000	1626000	Also, if you want to love us on Facebook
1626000	1628000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio
1628000	1630000	Please consider joining our little club there
1630000	1632000	On Facebook
1632000	1634000	And everybody likes to like things, so
1634000	1636000	Yes, so you should like us on Facebook
1636000	1638000	Which I think is actually what you do
1638000	1640000	You don't actually join, you just like
1640000	1642000	Because if people can like things like Chase Bank
1642000	1644000	Or, you know, Miracle Whip
1644000	1646000	Then they can like our damn show
1646000	1648000	Or RuPaul to host
1648000	1650000	Saturday Night Live and all that stuff
1650000	1652000	Although that really should happen
1652000	1654000	No, it shouldn't
1654000	1656000	I'm sorry, he's not, she's not funny
1656000	1658000	What?
1658000	1660000	Stop the show, stop the show
1660000	1662000	She's not funny
1662000	1664000	RuPaul is amazing
1664000	1666000	And you need to, have you ever watched
1666000	1668000	Drag Race, have you ever watched Drag Race
1668000	1670000	I've seen an episode
1670000	1672000	Then sit down and shut up, because you're saying no
1672000	1674000	In a creative way, you're saying no
1674000	1676000	I'm sorry, it would just be weird
1676000	1678000	It's funny, it is
1678000	1680000	Funny, drag queens are
1680000	1682000	Funny
1682000	1684000	Alright, fine, then if you bring RuPaul on there
1684000	1686000	You need to have at least more than one
1686000	1688000	Drag queen on there, because
1688000	1690000	Just a show about
1690000	1692000	Nothing but drag queens competing to
1692000	1694000	Be the biggest
1694000	1696000	Cunt of them all
1696000	1698000	Well that's not Saturday Night Live, that's why I'm saying
1698000	1700000	You need more drag queens on there if you're gonna bring her on there
1702000	1704000	Those guys dress up as chicks all the time
1704000	1706000	On Saturday Night Live
1706000	1708000	This is the only video gaming podcast
1708000	1710000	Where you will hear
1710000	1712000	A very straight guy arguing
1712000	1714000	With a very gay guy about drag queens
1714000	1716000	I'm just saying
1716000	1718000	RuPaul needs a video game
1718000	1720000	You know you want it
1720000	1722000	I'm just telling you
1722000	1724000	If they made a game for Connect called
1724000	1726000	You better work
1726000	1728000	Okay, I get it
1728000	1730000	See?
1730000	1732000	And you know you want RuPaul being all
1732000	1734000	Alright, let's see that dance again
1734000	1736000	And don't fuck it up
1736000	1738000	But Rob, alternate costume has to be the suit
1738000	1740000	From Drag U
1740000	1742000	And we could
1742000	1744000	It could film you on the Connect device
1744000	1746000	But then like as you do better
1746000	1748000	It just starts to put like
1748000	1750000	Costume parts on you, it'd be really funny
1750000	1752000	And then we make Loki play it
1752000	1754000	And take pictures and upload them to the interwebs
1754000	1756000	Hilarity
1756000	1758000	That's up there with Tingle
1758000	1760000	Alright, anyhow
1760000	1762000	Loomis
1762000	1764000	Just join chat
1764000	1766000	Just to tell Loki to get a sense of humor
1766000	1768000	Hahaha
1768000	1770000	Oh, Loki
1770000	1772000	Alright, also Twitter
1772000	1774000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
1774000	1776000	Not Twitter.com slash RuPaul
1776000	1778000	Just saying
1778000	1780000	Alright, let's actually get into some video game news
1780000	1782000	Which I'm only trying to make you laugh
1782000	1784000	Because the news we have is very depressing
1784000	1786000	I think it's funny
1786000	1788000	Not me
1788000	1790000	You are rude
1790000	1792000	That's hilarious, Bizarre Creations
1792000	1794000	Is terrible
1794000	1796000	It's like, hey, you know what
1796000	1798000	We decided to have a really terrible idea
1798000	1800000	And release a Bond game
1800000	1802000	That's based off of no movie whatsoever
1802000	1804000	And we're gonna pimp out Daniel Craig
1804000	1806000	In it again because we apparently
1806000	1808000	Own the likeness of Daniel Craig
1808000	1810000	For a long time now, that's why he's also
1810000	1812000	In Goldeneye
1812000	1814000	But yes, Bizarre Creations
1814000	1816000	They've done some pretty awesome things
1816000	1818000	And some pretty terrible things
1818000	1820000	Awesome being their racing games
1820000	1822000	Project Gotham Racing Series
1822000	1824000	Cooler, terrible being
1824000	1826000	And Geometry Wars
1826000	1828000	Yes, Geometry Wars, the awesome
1828000	1830000	Racing game
1830000	1832000	What the hell, you need to listen
1832000	1834000	No, Geometry Wars is an amazing game
1834000	1836000	Stop interrupting me
1836000	1838000	No!
1838000	1840000	Yes, you shut up
1840000	1842000	Other things that were awesome
1842000	1844000	Non-racing
1844000	1846000	Geometry Wars
1846000	1848000	Terrible things that they've released
1848000	1850000	The Club
1850000	1852000	Yes, they're
1852000	1854000	No, The Club, their shooter that wasn't
1854000	1856000	Quite good
1856000	1858000	And of course, James Bond
1858000	1860000	Bloodstone, which
1860000	1862000	Not very good, but it also has some driving in there
1862000	1864000	But driving apparently is better than the Bond game
1864000	1866000	Anyhow
1866000	1868000	So they're getting closed down
1868000	1870000	Because apparently
1870000	1872000	They aren't making enough money for their pimps
1872000	1874000	At Activision
1874000	1876000	And
1876000	1878000	Apparently they're giving them a 90 day period
1878000	1880000	Which I guess
1880000	1882000	Is serving as notice to the
1882000	1884000	Employees that their company is likely to be
1884000	1886000	Closed, sold, downsized, etc.
1886000	1888000	And apparently
1888000	1890000	Activision says over the past three years since
1890000	1892000	Our purchase of Bizarre Creations
1892000	1894000	The fundamentals of racing genres
1894000	1896000	Have significantly changed
1896000	1898000	Although we
1898000	1900000	Made a substantial investment
1900000	1902000	In creating a new IP
1902000	1904000	Blur
1904000	1906000	It did not find a
1906000	1908000	Commercial audience
1908000	1910000	Mind you, that they're
1910000	1912000	Still keeping the Tony Hawk
1912000	1914000	Ride franchise around
1914000	1916000	Even though that's
1916000	1918000	Incredibly terrible
1918000	1920000	But, you know, Blur
1920000	1922000	A racing game that probably had a decent
1922000	1924000	Following, just not exactly, you know
1924000	1926000	Tony Hawk
1926000	1928000	Ride numbers, maybe
1928000	1930000	Which I do know that they sold more than Tony Hawk
1930000	1932000	Ride, by the way
1932000	1934000	And then of course
1934000	1936000	Other developers and whatever
1936000	1938000	And there is a chance though
1938000	1940000	That they may be purchased by somebody else
1940000	1942000	Obviously
1942000	1944000	Because Project Gotham Racer is an awesome
1944000	1946000	Series
1946000	1948000	It's funny how they sucked when they were bought
1948000	1950000	By Activision, but they were still pretty awesome
1950000	1952000	When they were with Microsoft
1952000	1954000	Could it happen to be maybe
1954000	1956000	Activision is to blame?
1956000	1958000	Hey Jamie, knock knock
1958000	1960000	Who's there? Interrupting cow
1960000	1962000	Boo!
1962000	1964000	That's all I know how to do is interrupt people
1964000	1966000	Well you weren't
1966000	1968000	Listening, obviously, because you're like
1968000	1970000	Hey, guess what
1970000	1972000	Geometry Wars was awesome
1972000	1974000	Hey, listen
1974000	1976000	I just feel, you know, that's
1976000	1978000	Right, it was an awesome game
1978000	1980000	But it wasn't an awesome racing game
1980000	1982000	Which is what I was talking about
1982000	1984000	Well maybe it should have been
1984000	1986000	Maybe they should have had Geometry Wars racing
1986000	1988000	Blur was actually kind of like that
1988000	1990000	A little bit
1990000	1992000	Shoot him up and the whole little like
1992000	1994000	Art thing going on with it
1994000	1996000	Honestly, when I saw Blur
1996000	1998000	I couldn't get
1998000	2000000	It wasn't very interesting to me
2000000	2002000	SplitSecond was more interesting to me
2002000	2004000	And, well, part of the problem with Blur
2004000	2006000	Is that it came out like the same week
2006000	2008000	As SplitSecond
2008000	2010000	ModNation Racers
2010000	2012000	And, you know, while Mario Kart is still selling big
2012000	2014000	You know, and
2014000	2016000	It's just kind of unfortunate, but
2016000	2018000	I don't know
2018000	2020000	Does our creations really deserve to bite the bullet
2020000	2022000	I don't know
2022000	2024000	I think you hit the nail on the head
2024000	2026000	They were doing fine until Activision bought them
2026000	2028000	Well, Activision, they're like
2028000	2030000	Hey, you know, we need you to make some better stuff
2030000	2032000	So we're going to have you do a James Bond game
2032000	2034000	Honestly
2034000	2036000	I can't think of a James Bond game
2036000	2038000	Since Goldeneye that has sold well
2038000	2040000	And those are the ones
2040000	2042000	Normally based off movies
2042000	2044000	This was based off of nothing
2044000	2046000	So, their excuse was
2046000	2048000	Well, you know, since there's a lawsuit
2048000	2050000	Going on right now with the James Bond
2050000	2052000	Licensing and stuff
2052000	2054000	So, hey, this is the closest thing
2054000	2056000	You're going to get to a new movie
2056000	2058000	Well, that's great and all
2058000	2060000	Except no one cares
2060000	2062000	And
2062000	2064000	I don't know
2064000	2066000	It was just a terrible idea
2066000	2068000	Another company
2068000	2070000	Also taking some cuts
2070000	2072000	Thanks to Activision is Budcat
2072000	2074000	And Budcat
2074000	2076000	Of course, they were
2076000	2078000	One of the developers that was acquired
2078000	2080000	To work on a Guitar Hero franchise
2082000	2084000	And of course, it says
2084000	2086000	Approximately 88 positions
2086000	2088000	Or approximately 1%
2088000	2090000	Of our global workforce has been
2090000	2092000	Affected by the layoffs
2092000	2094000	So that's
2094000	2096000	1% is not bad, I guess
2096000	2098000	It says Budcat though
2098000	2100000	Is comprised of roughly 60 people
2100000	2102000	So
2102000	2104000	I don't know
2104000	2106000	It's interesting, I guess they were saying
2106000	2108000	They're doing
2108000	2110000	They're targeting
2110000	2112000	Reduction in jobs
2112000	2114000	For its QA department
2114000	2116000	I guess that makes sense
2116000	2118000	Because, I mean, they hire
2118000	2120000	And fire people for QA all the time
2120000	2122000	Based on
2122000	2124000	You know, the games that are coming out
2124000	2126000	Although
2126000	2128000	Some of those games
2128000	2130000	Probably should keep the QA department
2130000	2132000	Around a little bit longer
2132000	2134000	Not necessarily just with Activision
2134000	2136000	But companies like Bethesda
2136000	2138000	Might learn too
2138000	2140000	By keeping more QA around
2140000	2142000	You won't release buggy ass games
2142000	2144000	Like Fallout New Vegas
2144000	2146000	And Activision, they're saying
2146000	2148000	We continue to streamline our music
2148000	2150000	Development resources to ensure that
2150000	2152000	They are aligned against our slate
2152000	2154000	And strategic goals
2154000	2156000	As a result, we are implementing
2156000	2158000	A targeted reduction in jobs
2158000	2160000	In our QA team in California
2160000	2162000	And closing our Budcat studio
2162000	2164000	In Iowa
2164000	2166000	Budcat has a great partner to Activision
2166000	2168000	And has created a lasting impact
2168000	2170000	On the Guitar Hero franchise
2170000	2172000	Honestly, I think what this is coming around to
2172000	2174000	Is that before they had
2174000	2176000	One team developing stuff
2176000	2178000	For Guitar Hero
2178000	2180000	And then they acquired a few more studios
2180000	2182000	To do stuff for Guitar Hero
2182000	2184000	And now that they're reducing the amount of games
2184000	2186000	They're releasing each year
2186000	2188000	From Metallica's, Van Halen's
2188000	2190000	And whatnot
2190000	2192000	They don't need that many development teams anymore
2192000	2194000	Because they're going to be releasing
2194000	2196000	One Guitar Hero game a year
2196000	2198000	Approximately
2198000	2200000	I hate to say it because it's never happy news
2200000	2202000	To report on game studios closing
2202000	2204000	But unlike the last one, this one makes a little more sense
2204000	2206000	We know there's been too much saturation
2206000	2208000	Of the Guitar Hero games
2208000	2210000	So to hear that one of the studios that's been making
2210000	2212000	All these unnecessary ports
2212000	2214000	Sorry, that's how I feel
2214000	2216000	That shutting down makes more sense
2216000	2218000	Than the last one you reported on
2218000	2220000	Especially with the story we're going to get into here in a minute
2220000	2222000	Which you know is not inevitable
2222000	2224000	About the music games kind of
2224000	2226000	Slowing down as it is
2226000	2228000	I don't know if they are slowing down
2228000	2230000	I think
2230000	2232000	People have their expectations
2232000	2234000	Wrong on some of these games
2234000	2236000	But we'll get into that
2236000	2238000	A little bit later
2238000	2240000	I just don't agree with
2240000	2242000	What they're saying
2242000	2244000	LucasArts, another company that's not Activision
2244000	2246000	Is also confirming layoffs
2246000	2248000	And they're saying that they're
2248000	2250000	Committing
2250000	2252000	To their internal development
2252000	2254000	And they're saying that recently
2254000	2256000	They've made minor adjustments in staffing
2256000	2258000	And that
2258000	2260000	It will help them better address
2260000	2262000	The needs of the business
2262000	2264000	And they're remaining
2264000	2266000	They remain committed to
2266000	2268000	Their internal studio
2268000	2270000	And fostering relationships with trusted
2270000	2272000	internal partners in order to develop blah blah blah
2272000	2274000	In other words
2274000	2276000	They just let some people go
2276000	2278000	Outsource
2278000	2280000	And of course
2280000	2282000	They had let go
2282000	2284000	Some of their staff
2284000	2286000	Earlier
2286000	2288000	This year as well
2288000	2290000	Back in September
2290000	2292000	I guess
2292000	2294000	This is
2294000	2296000	I don't know if it's necessarily
2296000	2298000	To do with poor sales in different games
2298000	2300000	Or whatnot but honestly
2300000	2302000	LucasArts doesn't have
2302000	2304000	A lot of games coming out each year
2304000	2306000	It's maybe one or two titles a year so
2306000	2308000	I don't know
2308000	2310000	It's kind of to be expected I guess
2310000	2312000	Since they just finished a big title
2312000	2314000	Yeah I guess
2314000	2316000	Still kind of sucks but
2316000	2318000	Okay
2318000	2320000	What's going to happen when they run out of Star Wars games to make?
2320000	2322000	I don't think they ever will
2322000	2324000	They never will
2324000	2326000	Besides they have the huge MMO coming out
2326000	2328000	Of Bioware but whatever
2328000	2330000	And then finally
2330000	2332000	745 Studios
2332000	2334000	The company behind the
2334000	2336000	Well the game
2336000	2338000	PowerGig
2338000	2340000	They also said that they are
2340000	2342000	Linging off people
2342000	2344000	Apparently
2344000	2346000	Approximately 20 to 30 people were let go
2346000	2348000	Most of which were in the QA team
2348000	2350000	And a bunch of full time staff
2350000	2352000	And of course
2352000	2354000	They're saying that
2354000	2356000	With the gig already on the store shelves
2356000	2358000	Last week's 745 Studios restructured
2358000	2360000	The company is both a part of the
2360000	2362000	Natural cycle in game development and the focus
2362000	2364000	On the development needs of its upcoming game projects
2364000	2366000	Also the fact that
2366000	2368000	Their games scored really poor
2368000	2370000	Or really poorly
2370000	2372000	As far as reviews go
2372000	2374000	Was not a good game unfortunately
2374000	2376000	And this is the studio
2376000	2378000	Thanks to everyone who contributed to their first game
2378000	2380000	PowerGig Rise of the Sixth Stream
2380000	2382000	And we wish the individuals impacted by the reorganization
2382000	2384000	All the best
2386000	2388000	So yeah lots of people getting let going
2388000	2390000	Right before the holidays
2390000	2392000	I feel like this is like an echo of what happened last year
2392000	2394000	This is sad but I mean it's kind of a
2394000	2396000	I guess it's to be expected
2396000	2398000	But it doesn't
2398000	2400000	These are the folks that bring our games
2400000	2402000	Well I think it makes sense because if you think about it
2402000	2404000	Maybe these games
2404000	2406000	For some of these smaller companies
2406000	2408000	Not necessarily Activision and Bazaar
2408000	2410000	And stuff like that
2410000	2412000	It's like 745 I would think
2412000	2414000	That they're developing the game and stuff
2414000	2416000	They don't really need a large QA team until they're getting
2416000	2418000	The product all fleshed out
2418000	2420000	And then they're gonna hire people in
2420000	2422000	And unfortunately QA
2422000	2424000	A lot of the testers and stuff
2424000	2426000	It's not as glamorous
2426000	2428000	As the tester would like you
2428000	2430000	To think
2430000	2432000	It's really just like
2432000	2434000	Minimum wage
2434000	2436000	Shit job that you take
2436000	2438000	And you get hired and fired
2438000	2440000	Pretty regularly
2440000	2442000	So it's not a big shock
2442000	2444000	Yeah I mean I hate to say it
2444000	2446000	But especially when you consider
2446000	2448000	That Power Gig has come out now
2448000	2450000	And it's kind of landed with this big
2450000	2452000	Unfortunately
2452000	2454000	It makes this news
2454000	2456000	A lot less surprising
2456000	2458000	But again
2458000	2460000	It is better than Rock Revolution
2460000	2462000	Yeah but a studio like Konami
2462000	2464000	Can kind of take the blunt
2464000	2466000	Of some of that
2466000	2468000	Studio Closure's economy too
2468000	2470000	I mean they closed one of their big offices
2470000	2472000	I think two actually
2472000	2474000	Well Hawaii had closed at one point
2474000	2476000	And then they had the Bay Area one closed
2476000	2478000	So I mean it's not like even the big companies are immune
2478000	2480000	To this sort of thing
2480000	2482000	But you know I don't like to report on people losing their jobs
2482000	2484000	As happy happy
2484000	2486000	But I think that the silver lining to this
2486000	2488000	Is that you know
2488000	2490000	For I hate to sound like such a dork
2490000	2492000	But you know for every door that closes another opens
2492000	2494000	But especially in the gaming world
2494000	2496000	They will be on their way out
2496000	2498000	Well I don't think, well we're going to get into that in a minute
2498000	2500000	But they're not what they were before
2500000	2502000	Something new will come to take its place
2502000	2504000	You know we're not looking at another
2504000	2506000	Huge video game crash
2506000	2508000	Or there's going to be no jobs in gaming whatsoever
2508000	2510000	I think there will be other opportunities
2510000	2512000	That just might not be the same type of game
2512000	2514000	Or the same studio as before
2514000	2516000	So hopefully these guys land on their feet somewhere else
2516000	2518000	You know what I mean
2518000	2520000	Like there wouldn't have been a Power Gig in the first place
2520000	2524000	If Guitar Hero and Rock Band hadn't done so well, right?
2524000	2526000	Yeah, so
2526000	2528000	Anyhow, I guess I've referenced this enough
2528000	2530000	But you might have been reading some stories this week
2530000	2532000	It is being reported that music game sales
2532000	2534000	Are continuing a downward trend
2534000	2538000	It's an analysis that was originally published by Gamasutra
2538000	2542000	They were looking at the period of January through October
2542000	2544000	For the past three years
2544000	2546000	Looking at music game revenues
2546000	2550000	Apparently it was $1.6 billion in 2008
2550000	2554000	And where they are today, under $250 million for the year so far
2554000	2556000	And they say short of a Christmas miracle
2556000	2560000	Music games won't break $400 million for all of 2010
2560000	2564000	So that would be what, a quarter of where they were in 2008?
2564000	2566000	So
2566000	2568000	While that is kind of sad
2568000	2570000	I also kind of go back and say
2570000	2572000	Okay, well wait a minute
2572000	2578000	2007 was the first year that Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 came out?
2578000	2580000	So
2580000	2582000	To go January-October of 2008
2582000	2585000	That was the period when everybody was playing it over at their friends' houses
2585000	2587000	And all that
2587000	2589000	Yeah, and
2589000	2591000	I don't know, I mean
2591000	2594000	With Rock Band at least, they didn't have to sell software
2594000	2596000	They were selling download content
2596000	2599000	Now I'm not really sure if that counts download content
2599000	2602000	As part of that revenue
2602000	2605000	But that's where all their money's been made lately
2605000	2607000	It's not been with new games
2607000	2609000	I mean, yeah, they just released a new game
2609000	2611000	But it's been out for maybe
2611000	2613000	Not even a month yet
2613000	2615000	Well, actually just slightly over a month
2615000	2617000	But
2617000	2619000	I don't know, it's hard to say that
2619000	2621000	It's dying
2621000	2623000	I think a lot of people are like
2623000	2625000	Maybe they don't need the keyboard peripheral
2625000	2627000	Maybe they're happy with the hundreds of songs
2627000	2629000	That they have in Rock Band 2
2629000	2631000	Here's my thought though
2631000	2633000	And I'm gonna bring this full circle
2633000	2635000	Watch
2635000	2637000	To say that music games are declining
2637000	2639000	And on their way out the door
2639000	2641000	Is an extremely ignorant statement to me
2641000	2643000	Because it's no different than
2643000	2645000	Remember earlier in the show when you were speaking about
2645000	2647000	Guwang
2647000	2649000	And you were saying it was like every other cave shooter
2649000	2651000	And somebody took issue with that
2651000	2653000	For me, it's very similar to what's happening here with music games
2653000	2655000	I don't think the period of music games
2655000	2657000	Means the period of plastic guitars
2657000	2659000	And plastic drums
2659000	2661000	Is satiating
2661000	2663000	There's not anything else you can really do
2663000	2665000	With this
2665000	2667000	I mean, Rock Band 3 is trying with the keyboards
2667000	2669000	And so forth, but it's unfortunately
2669000	2671000	Not really gonna be enough
2671000	2673000	That doesn't mean music games are dead
2673000	2675000	Look at Dance Central
2675000	2677000	I can say pretty confidently
2677000	2679000	It's the best selling Kinect game right now
2679000	2681000	That isn't the one that's packaged in
2681000	2683000	With the Kinect
2683000	2685000	Probably the two big ones
2685000	2687000	Still though, to be doing that well
2687000	2689000	Kinda shows that maybe there's a future there
2689000	2691000	And maybe other types of music games
2691000	2693000	That haven't quite been thought of yet
2693000	2695000	Believe me guys, we've been following music games
2695000	2697000	For a very long time here on OLR
2697000	2699000	Here's a perfect example
2699000	2701000	Ten years ago it was DDR
2701000	2703000	Before that, even Parappa the Rappa
2703000	2705000	Busta
2705000	2707000	Just all these other games
2707000	2709000	Perfect example, what do you think the top Wii title was for October?
2709000	2711000	For October, the top Wii title?
2711000	2713000	Probably, it's still Wii Play
2713000	2715000	No
2715000	2717000	And you would think, maybe it might be Kirby's
2717000	2719000	You know, the
2719000	2721000	Epic Yarn or whatever
2721000	2723000	It's gonna be something a lot more
2723000	2725000	Like every
2725000	2727000	Adult picks it up for the family
2727000	2729000	It's gonna be something family
2729000	2731000	It's a Wii Party
2731000	2733000	Just Dance 2
2733000	2735000	Okay
2735000	2737000	Not too surprised, okay
2737000	2739000	And not even close for second place
2739000	2741000	Just Dance 2
2741000	2743000	For the month of October
2743000	2745000	And this is since it was released
2745000	2747000	Cause I believe it came out the second or third week
2747000	2749000	Of October
2749000	2753000	It sold 285,556 units
2753000	2755000	Compare that with second place
2755000	2757000	Which would've been
2757000	2759000	Wii Fit Plus
2759000	2761000	With Balance Board
2761000	2763000	Cause you know those games
2763000	2765000	You know, Ten to Sell
2765000	2767000	And Wii Party of course
2767000	2769000	Wii Fit Plus 89,000
2769000	2771000	So it
2771000	2773000	Oversold it by more than double
2773000	2775000	And same with
2775000	2777000	Wii Party
2777000	2779000	It was 92,000
2779000	2781000	So
2781000	2783000	You know
2783000	2785000	You can't really see that the music genre is dead
2785000	2787000	Because these games are just doing
2787000	2789000	Crazy well
2789000	2791000	Just Dance, the first one
2791000	2793000	Number 8 for October
2793000	2795000	And it sold actually
2795000	2797000	I just wanna say real quick
2797000	2799000	To be fair in the Gamasutra
2799000	2801000	And I'm not interrupting you, I promise
2801000	2803000	To be fair in the original Gamasutra report
2803000	2805000	They are acknowledging that Dance Central
2805000	2807000	Could be a new opportunity for where this is going
2807000	2809000	But nowhere in this report does it mention
2809000	2811000	Just Dance
2811000	2813000	It should, and here's another cool fact
2813000	2815000	You know
2815000	2817000	Games like Wii Fit
2817000	2819000	And stuff like that
2819000	2821000	Sold a lot
2821000	2823000	Four million copies
2823000	2825000	From launch to date
2825000	2827000	Some other stuff
2827000	2829000	Real quick, I'm trying to find another game that would have been
2829000	2831000	Like a real big one here
2831000	2833000	Let's see here
2833000	2835000	Okay, here we go
2835000	2837000	Metroid Other M
2837000	2839000	You know, I guess that's kind of a poor comparison
2839000	2841000	Because it didn't do well all the way
2841000	2843000	Well yeah, Reggie acknowledged it's not
2843000	2845000	187,000 life
2845000	2847000	From launch
2847000	2849000	Okay, here we go, here we go
2849000	2851000	How about like a Mario Party 8
2851000	2853000	See that did 3.2 million
2853000	2855000	Launch to date
2855000	2857000	And you know
2857000	2859000	The
2859000	2861000	Just Dance series, the first one
2861000	2863000	Did actually
2863000	2865000	Pretty well, I mean within a year
2865000	2867000	It has sold almost 2 million units
2867000	2869000	1.8 million units
2871000	2873000	In closing, and here's kind of my closing thought
2873000	2875000	With this, this whole report here
2875000	2877000	Does not really sound like
2877000	2879000	A referendum on music games
2879000	2881000	So much as it is a referendum on
2881000	2883000	Harmonics, and maybe trying to make sense
2883000	2885000	Of why Viacom suddenly wants to
2885000	2887000	Unload them, because
2887000	2889000	Even though it's talking about Guitar Hero and Rock Band
2889000	2891000	I'm sorry, Guitar Hero was still a
2891000	2893000	Harmonics franchise
2893000	2895000	Yes, it's been turned over to somebody else since then
2895000	2897000	But Harmonics made that first game
2897000	2899000	That everything else has been modeled after
2899000	2901000	Everything that's happened
2901000	2903000	In the Guitar Hero franchise has been a rip-off
2903000	2905000	Of something Harmonics has done
2905000	2907000	Since Harmonics left the building, right?
2907000	2909000	Is that really an unfair thing to say?
2909000	2911000	No
2911000	2913000	So this is more speaking to, in my opinion
2913000	2915000	Harmonics
2915000	2917000	Than it is music games
2917000	2919000	Because nowhere in here are we talking about
2919000	2921000	The Just Dances of the World or the
2921000	2923000	You know, Konami, DDR
2923000	2925000	Which I'm sure is really nothing to scream about
2925000	2927000	But it's still out there cooking
2927000	2929000	And it's poking along
2929000	2931000	Unfortunately, that is the future of Rock Band
2931000	2933000	It's going to be like the
2933000	2935000	DDR releases
2935000	2937000	It's going to have its loyal following forever and ever
2937000	2939000	And it will still get its yearly releases
2939000	2941000	But they're going to, unfortunately, probably
2941000	2943000	Be a little more and more meh
2943000	2945000	But here's the thing, I think Harmonics
2945000	2947000	Is a studio that knows better
2947000	2949000	And will continue to innovate and such
2949000	2951000	Like they're trying to do with Dance Central
2951000	2953000	Which, you know, it seems to be working out
2953000	2955000	Well for them, and who knows whatever else
2955000	2957000	They're going to bring out in the future
2957000	2959000	Maybe something else connect, maybe that whole
2959000	2961000	Rumored revival of the amplitude frequency
2961000	2963000	Style game, who knows
2963000	2965000	Anyhow
2965000	2967000	Maybe I've spoken too long on this, I don't know
2967000	2969000	But if you want to join us in our chatroom
2969000	2971000	chat.orangeloungeradio.com
2971000	2973000	Some folks talking about Dance Masters
2973000	2975000	And maybe arcade games
2975000	2977000	Let's see, Dark Tetsuya
2977000	2979000	Saying, so if Konami could get with them
2979000	2981000	To put out Dance Masters, they could put it in arcades
2981000	2983000	Oh, Izzam says
2983000	2985000	Music games aren't out the door
2985000	2987000	They're just not the cash cow everyone wanted them to be
2987000	2989000	They were for a while
2989000	2991000	You know, I could see, see that's
2991000	2993000	One thing that's kind of cool about the Kinect
2993000	2995000	And the way it's set up, is
2995000	2997000	An arcade release wouldn't be that
2997000	2999000	Difficult for them
2999000	3001000	I mean seriously, since there's no controller involved
3001000	3003000	You just use the same damn technology
3003000	3005000	And away you go
3005000	3007000	Nothing like this lasts forever
3007000	3009000	Any type of fad in gaming
3009000	3011000	Or really anything it is
3011000	3013000	Movies even, nothing like this lasts forever
3013000	3015000	Like, remember teen comedies
3015000	3017000	When American Pie came out
3017000	3019000	We had every teen
3019000	3021000	Comedy in the world came out
3021000	3023000	Over the next couple years
3023000	3025000	And then suddenly, they didn't all start doing well
3025000	3027000	It doesn't mean teen comedies are gone forever
3027000	3029000	But it's just you don't see as many of them
3029000	3031000	Right? Or if they did come out
3031000	3033000	They're not the gross out
3033000	3035000	Stuff like American Pie was
3035000	3037000	People, they try to
3037000	3039000	You know, they try to figure out what the trends are
3039000	3041000	There's certain companies that will
3041000	3043000	Create those trends
3043000	3045000	And then there's other companies that will try to mimic
3045000	3047000	Those trends
3047000	3049000	And try to capitalize on them
3049000	3051000	And some of them do a good job of it
3051000	3053000	Like for example, when Activision
3053000	3055000	When Guitar Hero first came out
3055000	3057000	That was a good franchise
3057000	3059000	And then you had EA come out with
3059000	3061000	Rockband, of course both developed by the same company
3061000	3063000	But it kind of
3063000	3065000	You know, was taking
3065000	3067000	Some of the thunder from
3067000	3069000	Guitar Hero, but then improved upon it
3069000	3071000	It's hard though right now
3071000	3073000	Because it's hard to improve upon
3073000	3075000	What they've already got
3075000	3077000	With what's out there as far as
3077000	3079000	The peripherals go
3079000	3081000	And really, how much more can you do
3081000	3083000	Other than adding new instruments
3083000	3085000	To make these games any more
3085000	3087000	Unique or exciting or whatever
3087000	3089000	I mean, other than the song list
3089000	3091000	I guess in peripherals, it would just be
3091000	3093000	There's not much you can do with it
3093000	3095000	It hasn't been thought of yet
3095000	3097000	Who knew three years ago
3097000	3099000	We would be looking at a game like Dance Central
3099000	3101000	I don't think any of us could have predicted that
3101000	3103000	Um
3103000	3105000	Especially with the iToy stuff
3105000	3107000	It just didn't work well
3107000	3109000	It just didn't work well before
3109000	3111000	And I think a lot of us wrote it off then
3111000	3113000	As the trend that was going to go away
3113000	3115000	You know what I mean?
3115000	3117000	Oh, we saw this done on the iToy
3117000	3119000	And it was kind of ridiculous at best
3119000	3121000	So, bye
3121000	3123000	So who knew that the technology would be there later on
3123000	3125000	You know, perfect example of people trying to capitalize on this stuff
3125000	3127000	They have
3127000	3129000	It's funny
3129000	3131000	They actually have another dance game
3131000	3133000	For the Kinect that we haven't really heard of
3133000	3135000	Because it's only in the European markets
3135000	3137000	Dance Paradise
3137000	3139000	Yeah, I remember a story on this one had come up briefly
3139000	3141000	Didn't look very good
3141000	3143000	Kind of similar to
3143000	3145000	It reminds me a little bit of Dance Masters
3145000	3147000	But like, really dumbed down
3147000	3149000	Because it has all your
3149000	3151000	Avatar characters dancing around
3151000	3153000	Well, and you, me, and her can't exactly run over to Target
3153000	3155000	And get a copy of that
3155000	3157000	Exactly
3157000	3159000	And then the other thing too
3159000	3161000	Is the star plus dance
3161000	3163000	Something else that they're trying to capitalize on
3163000	3165000	The whole Just Dance and Dance Central stuff
3165000	3167000	But it's just not done well
3167000	3169000	And the problem is you're going to get a lot of these companies
3169000	3171000	Especially if Dance Central does really, really well
3171000	3173000	They're going to release their dance games
3173000	3175000	They're just going to be
3175000	3177000	Probably terrible
3177000	3179000	I bet you anything
3179000	3181000	Dance Central does really well
3181000	3183000	Well, we've already got the trademark for Dance Hero
3183000	3185000	How much you want to bet?
3185000	3187000	Alright, I want to say this real quick comment
3187000	3189000	From our good pal Bobby Blackwolf
3189000	3191000	Is in the chat
3191000	3193000	I want the inevitable Glee ripoff
3193000	3195000	Based on a marching band
3195000	3197000	Someone make this trend happen
3197000	3199000	That is one trend I'm not looking forward to
3199000	3201000	Is all the Glee ripoffs coming next season
3201000	3203000	By the way, because you know
3203000	3205000	The Glee game, Karaoke Revolution
3205000	3207000	I mentioned that there was a sequel on the way
3207000	3209000	V2
3209000	3211000	Road to, what was it?
3211000	3213000	Road to Regionals is the
3213000	3215000	The name
3215000	3217000	Will it have Teenage Dream in it?
3217000	3219000	Can't wait
3219000	3221000	Yay, now I know what to buy Dark Sakura
3221000	3223000	For Christmas, except she'll throw it at me
3223000	3225000	Or Hanukkah, excuse me
3225000	3227000	Chrismica
3227000	3231000	If I bought you Glee the video game on Wii
3231000	3233000	How quick would I be wearing the box?
3233000	3235000	I don't know
3235000	3237000	I'd have to actually get Becky over here to play it
3237000	3239000	I wouldn't play it
3239000	3241000	But she loves Glee, so I would let her play it
3241000	3243000	And then I would go
3243000	3245000	Trade it in and get a good game
3245000	3247000	But see, that's what Karaoke Revolution
3247000	3249000	Has become to
3249000	3251000	Konami
3251000	3253000	I don't think they take it seriously anymore
3253000	3255000	Well, I'm gonna get more attention to this
3255000	3257000	I know, let's attach
3257000	3259000	Glee to it
3259000	3261000	I know, let's attach American Idol
3261000	3263000	To it
3263000	3265000	How long
3265000	3267000	I can tell you how long
3267000	3269000	It's because once that show actually launches
3269000	3271000	How long are we gonna have Karaoke Revolution
3271000	3273000	X Factor edition
3273000	3275000	I mean, seriously
3275000	3277000	That's gonna be the next thing they have
3277000	3279000	Alright
3279000	3281000	Let's move on, we gotta talk about something
3281000	3283000	Not music games, so hopefully Dark Sakura
3283000	3285000	Can help us out, do you have a non-music game story for us?
3285000	3287000	Remember that thing that we
3287000	3289000	Were wondering if ever would come out
3289000	3291000	And it looks like it finally is, and maybe people
3291000	3293000	Care? Duke Nukem Forever?
3293000	3295000	Gran Turismo 5
3295000	3297000	Well, actually
3297000	3299000	It's gonna have a feature where you don't
3299000	3301000	Have to load the whole thing onto your
3301000	3303000	Hard drive, which is actually supposed to take
3303000	3305000	About 40 minutes to do
3305000	3307000	Wow
3307000	3309000	Yeah, it needs 6.4 gigabytes
3309000	3311000	Of hard drive space
3311000	3313000	Um
3313000	3315000	But what you can do is you can actually just
3315000	3317000	Opt not to and let stuff
3317000	3319000	Load as it will, but what it does
3319000	3321000	As it loads is that it loads
3321000	3323000	What you're playing
3323000	3325000	Onto your hard drive, so you're
3325000	3327000	Installing it in fragments
3327000	3329000	So it's
3329000	3331000	Copying over what you need
3331000	3333000	For that particular race
3333000	3335000	Exactly, and of course
3335000	3337000	You know, say that you do new content
3337000	3339000	Well, you've got
3339000	3341000	That going on, and then say you go back
3341000	3343000	To an old race, well it's already there, you don't have to worry about waiting
3343000	3345000	For it to really load
3345000	3347000	Because it'll be going off hard drive
3347000	3349000	Interesting, and I wonder if it, does it use any
3349000	3351000	Idle times? I don't know if this is even out there
3351000	3353000	Or not, like while you're on menus and stuff
3353000	3355000	Maybe to be doing some of the loading as well?
3355000	3357000	Um, sure it will be
3357000	3359000	Interesting
3359000	3361000	But the number of cars is listed on here
3361000	3363000	As 1031 cars
3363000	3365000	And that's pretty crazy
3365000	3367000	That's a lot of cars
3367000	3369000	Yeah
3369000	3371000	It's actually the largest install
3371000	3373000	That's gonna be on PS3
3373000	3375000	I mean, other big ones were
3375000	3377000	Devil May Cry
3377000	3379000	And Endwar
3379000	3381000	And Bioshock 2 and Lost Planet
3381000	3383000	They were around the five gig
3383000	3385000	Four and a half, five gig range
3385000	3387000	And this is 6.4
3387000	3389000	So it's big
3389000	3391000	And for our European listeners it will be out
3391000	3393000	On November 24th
3395000	3397000	That's an eventual
3397000	3399000	That's also for us, yeah
3399000	3401000	The worldwide launch thing
3401000	3403000	I was confirming
3403000	3405000	Men
3405000	3407000	Are you gonna pick it up?
3407000	3409000	Is it a game that interests you?
3409000	3411000	Probably, though I won't, Dan will get it
3411000	3413000	Okay
3413000	3415000	He's the one who sits here and waits for
3415000	3417000	All the new episodes of Top Gear to come out so he can
3417000	3419000	Watch them on the internet
3419000	3421000	So, oh give me that
3421000	3423000	I'm trying to open this new little
3423000	3425000	Toy I bought, sorry
3425000	3427000	Dark Soccer is using her nails
3427000	3429000	Maybe, maybe scissors?
3429000	3431000	I don't know, alright, anyhow, let's move on
3431000	3433000	More news, nobody wants to hear about my package
3433000	3435000	Opening drama, except for the fact, why do they
3435000	3437000	Make packages so difficult to open?
3437000	3439000	So people can't steal. Loss prevention
3439000	3441000	Still
3441000	3443000	And because they're so fragile
3443000	3445000	Just have the cameras and the beepers
3445000	3447000	Yeah, of course that never works either, the beepers
3447000	3449000	Always go off even when I legitimately
3449000	3451000	Bought them
3451000	3453000	Just to let everyone know I'm using the scissors
3453000	3455000	I stole from work
3455000	3457000	From the place of which I am officially
3457000	3459000	No longer employed
3459000	3461000	Way to stick it to them
3461000	3463000	Oh yeah, I'll take some scissors
3463000	3465000	Sure
3465000	3467000	So we were talking a little bit about the
3467000	3469000	Connect and Dance Central and stuff
3469000	3471000	Well Connect has actually sold pretty well
3471000	3473000	It's already moved a million units in the first ten days
3473000	3475000	And they're saying it's on track to hit their goal
3475000	3477000	Of five million this year
3477000	3479000	I have a little problem with that
3479000	3481000	Because
3481000	3483000	GameStop and
3483000	3485000	Me personally
3485000	3487000	Based off of what I've seen coming from Microsoft
3487000	3489000	They're saying there's shortages
3489000	3491000	Of this
3491000	3493000	You know, Connect hardware
3493000	3495000	So I'd be surprised
3495000	3497000	If they hit five million by the end of this year
3497000	3499000	Because what we see coming
3499000	3501000	Is definitely not
3501000	3503000	You know, a lot
3503000	3505000	Is it really shortage time?
3505000	3507000	Because when I was at Best Buy the other day, they had plenty
3507000	3509000	Well that's what GameStop's saying
3509000	3511000	They're saying it's hard to get
3511000	3513000	And I think that you're gonna see
3513000	3515000	It may be hard to find right now
3515000	3517000	Because they're holding them back for Black Friday
3517000	3519000	I don't know
3519000	3521000	I just know that there's a lot of them
3521000	3523000	On eBay going over retail
3523000	3525000	But people are crazy
3525000	3527000	And of course they're gonna say
3527000	3529000	Oh yeah, it's hard to get
3529000	3531000	But you know
3531000	3533000	It's gonna be one of the must have things
3533000	3535000	Definitely this holiday
3535000	3537000	So
3537000	3539000	You know, if you're interested in buying one
3539000	3541000	And especially if you're looking
3541000	3543000	To put it under the Christmas tree
3543000	3545000	Or in a stocking
3545000	3547000	Or whether festive
3547000	3549000	Kind of a big thing to put in a stocking
3549000	3551000	That's a really big sock
3551000	3553000	Really big stockings
3553000	3555000	If it's something
3555000	3557000	You're looking to purchase
3557000	3559000	For Christmas or a holiday or whatever
3559000	3561000	Give as a gift
3561000	3563000	You probably want to start looking now
3563000	3565000	Don't wait till the last minute
3565000	3567000	Alright
3567000	3569000	Well if they don't meet their numbers because of shortages
3569000	3571000	Then that's their own damn fault
3571000	3573000	How can you predict that you're gonna sell five million
3573000	3575000	Yet know at the same time you're not gonna make that many
3575000	3577000	They said three to five was their original expense
3577000	3579000	Now we're downplaying it a little bit
3579000	3581000	Alright
3581000	3583000	We'll see
3583000	3585000	I don't think they're going to
3585000	3587000	Here's the real message on everyone's mind
3587000	3589000	How's this doing compared to the move?
3589000	3591000	I don't know
3591000	3593000	I know Sony put out something and said
3593000	3595000	Oh yeah the move's done well
3595000	3597000	Fortunately the NPD and stuff
3597000	3599000	They don't really track
3599000	3601000	Accessory sales
3601000	3603000	Which is what this would be kind of considered
3603000	3605000	I guess
3605000	3607000	So I don't know
3607000	3609000	Maybe we'll find out in a future episode
3609000	3611000	Alright well moving on to some news
3611000	3613000	About Marvel vs. Capcom 3
3613000	3615000	We have a release date for the game
3615000	3617000	So I know this is something
3617000	3619000	Dark Sakura's gonna pick up
3619000	3621000	Or make Dan get for her
3621000	3623000	What a perfect opportunity
3623000	3625000	Dark Sakura just in time for Valentine's Day
3625000	3627000	Actually a little bit late
3627000	3629000	February 15th, 2011
3629000	3631000	So if you're willing to put Valentine's Day on hold
3631000	3633000	By one day you can make it of
3633000	3635000	Marvel meets Capcom and falls in love day
3635000	3637000	You know what?
3637000	3639000	We typically play games on Valentine's Day
3639000	3641000	So he can get me that
3641000	3643000	Instead of a bunch of roses
3643000	3645000	I don't care
3645000	3647000	At least he won't bitch about how much this costs
3647000	3649000	Instead of the roses
3649000	3651000	Just dip the box in chocolate
3651000	3653000	Yes to be fair this game would probably be cheaper than the roses
3653000	3655000	You know I always tell him that I want one
3655000	3657000	And he buys me a dozen
3657000	3659000	And I'm like, dude I want one
3659000	3661000	Maybe he thinks you mean one dozen
3661000	3663000	Maybe one doesn't
3663000	3665000	Alright the game is coming out
3665000	3667000	It's gonna be out on February 15th, 2011
3667000	3669000	On the 360 and the Playstation 3
3669000	3671000	Europe you have to wait just a few more days
3671000	3673000	So you might have to make it Valentine's week
3673000	3675000	February 18th is the day for you guys
3675000	3677000	There is a regular and special edition
3677000	3679000	And the special edition will cost you
3679000	3681000	70 bucks
3681000	3683000	Now in the news of more characters
3683000	3685000	There are some more characters announced for the game
3685000	3687000	She-Hulk and Zero
3687000	3689000	Are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3
3689000	3691000	I love She-Hulk, she's so awesome
3691000	3693000	She-Hulk is female Hulk
3693000	3695000	And Zero of course is from the Mega Man franchise
3695000	3697000	I wonder if she's also gonna
3697000	3699000	Break the fourth wall since they're letting Deadpool do it
3699000	3701000	Why not?
3701000	3703000	Well she does it in her own comic too
3703000	3705000	I don't see why they wouldn't
3705000	3707000	Be a good thing to do there
3707000	3709000	So those characters are coming out
3709000	3711000	I believe I was reading something about
3711000	3713000	They're the special edition characters too
3713000	3715000	So if you want all the characters
3715000	3717000	You gotta shout out the extra money
3717000	3719000	Oh no, I take that back
3719000	3721000	Jill Valentine is one of the special characters
3721000	3723000	And Shumagrath
3723000	3725000	I have to tell you
3725000	3727000	We always call Shumagrath Shumachan
3727000	3729000	Because apparently Shumagrath is supposed to be
3729000	3731000	Female but also a really bad tentacle rate monster
3731000	3733000	Seriously, Shumagrath
3733000	3735000	Is this giant eyeball with a bunch of tentacles
3735000	3737000	Alright
3737000	3739000	I was gonna say
3739000	3741000	Maybe a boss monster, but I guess it's not
3741000	3743000	Shumagrath was also in
3743000	3745000	Kinda like Medusa on crack
3745000	3747000	It was in
3747000	3749000	Marvel Superheroes vs Street Fighter
3749000	3751000	So there you go
3751000	3753000	In the special edition we'll also
3753000	3755000	Get you exclusive
3755000	3757000	Artwork, a steel book case
3757000	3759000	A one month
3759000	3761000	Subscription to Marvel's online digital
3761000	3763000	Comic service, that's kinda interesting
3763000	3765000	And a prologue comic that will be 12
3765000	3767000	Pages that will explain
3767000	3769000	Why there's a contest between these two
3769000	3771000	Universes, so they're gonna retcon this whole
3771000	3773000	Thing in which I'm sure will also be explained in the
3773000	3775000	Intro
3775000	3777000	But comics are different
3777000	3779000	So there you go
3779000	3781000	Remember, that comic will probably be
3781000	3783000	Scanned and put online immediately
3783000	3785000	I'm actually dying to know from Dark
3785000	3787000	Sakura since this is kinda part of the world she lives
3787000	3789000	In, how do you feel about the digital comic
3789000	3791000	Being a pack
3791000	3793000	In? I mean, do digital comics cut it
3793000	3795000	For you, or no thank you, I want
3795000	3797000	Books? Well
3797000	3799000	Given that I read a lot of my comics
3799000	3801000	Digitally anyway, it's just fine by me
3801000	3803000	Um, actually
3803000	3805000	Tiara and I share a
3805000	3807000	Subscription to Marvel digital comics
3807000	3809000	Oh, very cool
3809000	3811000	Yeah, so
3811000	3813000	It's mostly old comics
3813000	3815000	And a lot of them actually do have in print
3815000	3817000	But it's still pretty cool
3817000	3819000	And I've always
3819000	3821000	Did it say that
3821000	3823000	It was just a digital comic or one of the
3823000	3825000	Motion
3825000	3827000	Comics? It's the
3827000	3829000	Subscription to their digital comic service
3829000	3831000	But I mean, they say that they were
3831000	3833000	That they were gonna release another
3833000	3835000	Comic
3835000	3837000	I think the actual comic book that comes with it
3837000	3839000	The prologue comic is a physical comic book
3839000	3841000	Oh, see, that I want
3841000	3843000	Oh, nevermind, I misunderstood, I thought
3843000	3845000	Okay, so you have a digital comic and a
3845000	3847000	It's MODOK! Sorry
3847000	3849000	I was looking back at the video and I was like
3849000	3851000	Ah, MODOK
3851000	3853000	It's gonna be a fun fighting game, looking forward to it
3853000	3855000	I'm looking forward to it, and you know what, I love the little touches
3855000	3857000	Because I've been going back and watching movies
3857000	3859000	With characters, just to check
3859000	3861000	Authenticity
3861000	3863000	And there's been some pretty neat little touches in there
3863000	3865000	Now Marvel, I'm really happy for you
3865000	3867000	And I'm gonna let you finish
3867000	3869000	But Capcom vs. SNK
3869000	3871000	Was the best crossover fighting game of all time
3871000	3873000	So I'm looking forward to maybe that being next year
3873000	3875000	Just saying
3875000	3877000	More news stories
3877000	3879000	And then release dates coming up in just one moment
3879000	3881000	Dark Sakura
3881000	3883000	Well, in other news, we have
3883000	3885000	A bit of a cost
3885000	3887000	Issue with development on the 3DS
3887000	3889000	It's going
3889000	3891000	To be expensive
3891000	3893000	As in, probably three times
3893000	3895000	As expensive
3895000	3897000	As doing other
3897000	3899000	DS, as doing DS games
3899000	3901000	One times expensive for every dimension
3901000	3903000	Yeah
3903000	3905000	They're basically saying between
3905000	3907000	50 million and 150 million yen
3907000	3909000	Per
3909000	3911000	3DS title
3911000	3913000	So, um
3913000	3915000	That's a lot of money
3915000	3917000	It's going to
3917000	3919000	Pretty much, like, here's
3919000	3921000	An example
3921000	3923000	Gaming
3923000	3925000	Actually reported that
3925000	3927000	Japanese studios spend between 4.4 million
3927000	3929000	And 43.9 million on a DS title
3929000	3931000	And we're talking
3931000	3933000	50 million
3933000	3935000	To 150 million yen
3935000	3937000	Yikes
3937000	3939000	That's a lot of money
3939000	3941000	Yeah, and just to put that
3941000	3943000	Into perspective
3943000	3945000	At least for our UK listeners
3945000	3947000	They're spending roughly 33,000
3947000	3949000	To 333,000 pounds
3949000	3951000	And then
3951000	3953000	The estimated cost
3953000	3955000	Is going to be
3955000	3957000	A lot
3957000	3959000	A lot
3959000	3961000	Well, now, there's a part of me that wants to say, well, duh
3961000	3963000	You know, new system, new expenses
3963000	3965000	DS has been out a while
3965000	3967000	So, of course, it's cheap, and this is going to be new
3967000	3969000	But
3969000	3971000	There was a call
3971000	3973000	Especially when E3 was around
3973000	3975000	That they were saying, it's going to be easy to develop for
3975000	3977000	Because it's just like
3977000	3979000	Developing for other Nintendo platforms
3979000	3981000	Ease and cost are two different things
3981000	3983000	I guess that's true, but
3983000	3985000	They were saying, like, if your game at all
3985000	3987000	Is calculating a type of Z-axis
3987000	3989000	To render 3D in a 2D
3989000	3991000	TV, if you know what I mean
3991000	3993000	It's very easy to translate that into the 3DS
3993000	3995000	And remember, they were showing those demos
3995000	3997000	Of the 8-bit games
3997000	3999000	That, you know, were redone
3999000	4001000	And not just 8-bit, but they had the Zelda
4001000	4003000	All Green of Time was out there
4003000	4005000	And Star Fox was out there
4005000	4007000	I would imagine that they wouldn't be too difficult
4007000	4009000	To develop that kind of stuff because all they have to
4009000	4011000	Really do is create a second virtual camera
4011000	4013000	That's going to be, you know, one for each eye
4013000	4015000	And that's how you create your depth
4015000	4017000	For rendering purposes, but
4017000	4019000	I don't know
4019000	4021000	So I'm surprised to hear it's three
4021000	4023000	Times as much money
4023000	4025000	I mean, okay, a little bit more expensive
4025000	4027000	Perhaps that will
4027000	4029000	Stave off some of the
4029000	4031000	Shovelware that may appear on
4031000	4033000	That platform
4033000	4035000	That might be a nice side effect, but I sadly don't think
4035000	4037000	You're right
4037000	4039000	It's only a matter of time before those development
4039000	4041000	Costs come down, right?
4041000	4043000	So
4043000	4045000	Well, as technology
4045000	4047000	Catches up with it too, I think
4047000	4049000	But this is still
4049000	4051000	Mostly speculation, I think
4051000	4053000	You know, once they actually get practical
4053000	4055000	Costs out of it, once it's in motion
4055000	4057000	Then we'll be looking at something a little different
4057000	4059000	Alright, well, we'll see
4059000	4061000	We'll see if these, uh, spending
4061000	4063000	The money was worth the effort in just a few months
4063000	4065000	I can't believe I'm saying, a few months?
4065000	4067000	3DS is out for us all to
4067000	4069000	Consume. Alright, in the meantime, let's see
4069000	4071000	What's coming out a little more
4071000	4073000	Sooner for us to consume
4073000	4075000	That was the worst transition ever
4075000	4077000	Good one, you know we're going to have huge mungus
4077000	4079000	Lists
4079000	4081000	Anyhow, what's coming out of the
4081000	4083000	US? Black Friday is right around the corner
4083000	4085000	Can't wait to see what Steam is selling
4085000	4087000	On Black Friday. I was just telling Dan that earlier
4087000	4089000	Hey, apparently the whole
4089000	4091000	Game for Windows thing, 10 cents
4091000	4093000	For Age of Empires 3 today, and I'm sure
4093000	4095000	That's been everywhere, yeah
4095000	4097000	But, it's Age of Empires 3
4097000	4099000	I have 0 cents interest in that game
4099000	4101000	I mean, I think it's great that there's bargain basement
4101000	4103000	But the game's like 5 years old
4103000	4105000	No one cares anymore
4105000	4107000	Now that it's 10 cents, people do
4107000	4109000	Like, I could get a game for 10 cents
4109000	4111000	It's 5 years old
4111000	4113000	It wasn't selling any copies anyway
4113000	4115000	Anyhow
4115000	4117000	Today, actually, marked the release
4117000	4119000	Of Raving Rabbids Travel in Time
4119000	4121000	For the Nintendo Wii, as well as
4121000	4123000	Donkey Kong Country Returns, which I hear
4123000	4125000	Is pretty good
4125000	4127000	That is also on the Wii
4127000	4129000	This week, not a whole lot coming out, but some
4129000	4131000	Pretty cool stuff
4131000	4133000	Red Dead Redemption, the Undead Nightmare Collection
4133000	4135000	On Xbox 360 and Playstation 3
4135000	4137000	That is the Undead Nightmare expansion
4137000	4139000	Which brings a brand new single player
4139000	4141000	Campaign, as well as
4141000	4143000	All the multiplayer
4143000	4145000	Expansions
4145000	4147000	This can actually be played by itself
4147000	4149000	So you don't need the original Red Dead
4149000	4151000	So if you're looking to play some online Red Dead Redemption
4151000	4153000	And you want to do it cheaper
4153000	4155000	This is the way to go, because it's only 30 bucks
4155000	4157000	Hot Wheels
4157000	4159000	Track Attack on the Wii and DS
4159000	4161000	Actually kind of cool because you can
4161000	4163000	Build your own tracks with this one
4163000	4165000	And they have the 80's
4165000	4167000	Hot Wheel Orange Tracks
4167000	4169000	With it, so you gotta love that
4169000	4173000	This week also, the Rock Band 3 Pro Wireless Guitar
4173000	4175000	Is making its way out for 150 bucks
4175000	4177000	That's on Playstation 3 and
4177000	4179000	360
4179000	4181000	Silly Bands
4181000	4183000	A game based off of Robert Vance
4183000	4185000	Awesome
4185000	4187000	That's on Nintendo DS
4187000	4189000	Where all the shovelware lives
4189000	4191000	Challenge Me Brain Puzzles 2
4191000	4193000	On Nintendo DS
4193000	4195000	That looks terrible as well
4195000	4197000	Some re-releases
4197000	4199000	Looks like it's kind of capitalizing
4199000	4201000	Black Friday stuff
4201000	4203000	They're re-releasing Enemy Territory
4203000	4205000	Quake Wars and Soul Calibur 4
4205000	4207000	This is by a third party company
4207000	4209000	Which is why none of those are from the same
4209000	4211000	Publisher
4211000	4213000	That's for 30 bucks
4213000	4215000	I think there's some more coming out later this week as well
4215000	4217000	Splatterhouse
4217000	4219000	Coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
4219000	4221000	This week
4221000	4223000	Include the original Splatterhouse game as well
4223000	4225000	As kind of an unlockable bonus
4225000	4227000	CSI Unsolved on Nintendo DS
4227000	4229000	Majin
4229000	4231000	And the Forsaken Kingdom on
4231000	4233000	Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
4233000	4235000	Another re-release pack
4235000	4237000	Kalbella's
4237000	4239000	Outdoor Adventures and
4239000	4241000	Rapala Fishing
4241000	4243000	That's for 30 bucks as well
4243000	4245000	Monster Jam
4245000	4247000	Path of Destruction for Playstation 3
4247000	4249000	This is a bundle that comes with a stupid wheel
4249000	4251000	To your DualShock 3 controller
4251000	4253000	Great
4253000	4255000	Worms Battle Island for Nintendo Wii
4255000	4257000	Another re-release pack
4257000	4259000	Brutal Legends and Splinter Cell
4259000	4261000	Double Agent
4261000	4263000	Man, some of these games are dirt cheap
4263000	4265000	I'm not sure if you're getting a great deal on this
4265000	4267000	But that's on Xbox 360
4267000	4269000	Drawn to Life Collection
4269000	4271000	A re-release of those two games
4271000	4273000	That's on Nintendo DS
4273000	4275000	To tie in with the new Disney movie
4275000	4277000	Disney's Tangled
4277000	4279000	On DS and Wii
4279000	4281000	Pro Evolution Soccer 2011
4281000	4283000	On the Wii
4283000	4285000	And it looks like they're doing
4285000	4287000	A Sonic the Hedgehog
4287000	4289000	Re-release pack
4289000	4291000	Sega All-Stars Racing and Sonic Unleashed
4291000	4293000	That's for 35 bucks
4293000	4295000	And also Brutal Legends and
4295000	4297000	Timeshift, those are on Playstation 3
4297000	4299000	For 30 bucks
4299000	4301000	Eternal Sonata and Katamari Forever 2
4301000	4303000	Pack, that's 35 dollars
4303000	4305000	And some actual new stuff
4305000	4307000	Michael Jackson, The Experience
4307000	4309000	Special Edition, which is on
4309000	4311000	Nintendo Wii, that does include a
4311000	4313000	Jewel-encrusted white glove
4313000	4315000	Just to complete the experience
4315000	4317000	Which I really want
4317000	4319000	Loki to wear to an episode of the show
4319000	4321000	Caution, rhinestones
4321000	4323000	Cupid Zirconia
4323000	4325000	That's also available on DS

4337000	4339000	The standard and the limited edition
4341000	4343000	And that
4343000	4345000	Wraps up the week, of course it's kind of
4345000	4347000	Gonna be slowing down
4347000	4349000	Here quite a bit, so don't expect much
4349000	4351000	Coming soon
4351000	4353000	Alright, well we'll travel over to Japan and look at
4353000	4355000	What's coming out of there, on the 360
4355000	4357000	Dudampachi Resurrection
4357000	4359000	Comes out in regular and limited edition
4359000	4361000	This is from Cave, so you know
4361000	4363000	Where this is going, right Loki?
4363000	4365000	It's a shooter game, but this is a
4365000	4367000	You know, it's kind of like made for the 360
4367000	4369000	So it's very purdy
4369000	4371000	Kind of looking at the graphics here
4371000	4373000	So check that out, that is on the 360 this week
4373000	4375000	And that really is the big release in
4375000	4377000	Japan this week on the 360
4377000	4379000	There is Shaun White skateboarding
4379000	4381000	But no one curr
4381000	4383000	Alright, moving on to the PlayStation 3
4383000	4385000	This week, Gran Turismo 5
4385000	4387000	Not only coming out here, but in Japan as well
4387000	4389000	So check that out if you like that stuff
4389000	4391000	Also, Pachipata 16
4391000	4393000	Gengita Paradise 2
4393000	4395000	Comes out this week
4395000	4397000	From Irem
4397000	4399000	And yeah, it's just pretty much
4399000	4401000	Chicks on the beach playing pachinko games
4401000	4403000	That is literally what this game is
4403000	4405000	But they're all like 3D rendered and shit
4405000	4407000	Look at this 3D rendering of pachinko machines
4407000	4409000	It almost looks like a
4409000	4411000	Make your own pin
4411000	4413000	Type of mode, where you can put the pins wherever you want
4413000	4415000	I'm telling you, it's a big deal there
4415000	4417000	There also is a
4417000	4419000	PlayStation 3 bundle
4419000	4421000	With the console coming out
4421000	4423000	With the Gran Turismo bundled in
4423000	4425000	Because it's kind of a big deal in Japan
4425000	4427000	So look for that this week
4427000	4429000	Shaun White skateboarding as well, big deal
4429000	4431000	Trinity Zero comes out this week
4431000	4433000	That's also a PlayStation 3 game
4433000	4435000	That's coming from Koei
4435000	4437000	And this is like a swords and magic type of game
4437000	4439000	Kind of looks like you have a party of people
4439000	4441000	But it looks to be a little bit more of like a
4441000	4443000	Action-y type of
4443000	4445000	Roleplaying game
4445000	4447000	So that actually looks kind of rad
4447000	4449000	Is this coming out in the US as well?
4449000	4451000	Not this year, probably next year
4451000	4453000	That might be one that you want to import
4453000	4455000	For those of you that are big into importing
4455000	4457000	But just be careful
4457000	4459000	It's a lot of Japanese
4459000	4461000	So if you don't know Japanese
4461000	4463000	You might be screwed
4463000	4465000	Mario Sports Mix this week
4465000	4467000	On the Nintendo Wii in Japan
4467000	4469000	And we got that here
4469000	4471000	Or are getting it here
4471000	4473000	I remember playing this one at E3
4473000	4475000	Just the hockey and dodgeball

4603000	4605000	So getting that
4605000	4607000	And
4607000	4609000	There's a bunch more

4615000	4617000	Yeah Venetica is supposed to be coming over here in January
4617000	4619000	So that should be cool
4619000	4621000	You played the Daughter of the Devil
4621000	4623000	Yeah that actually looks pretty interesting
4623000	4625000	Because apparently
4625000	4627000	Death is real or not the Devil
4627000	4629000	Death
4629000	4631000	The Daughter of Death
4631000	4633000	Close enough
4633000	4635000	Both begin with D
4635000	4637000	That looks kind of interesting
4637000	4639000	Jimmy
4639000	4641000	Eh
4641000	4643000	It does kind of have a bit of a
4643000	4645000	Fable vibe to it just in looks
4645000	4647000	Yeah
4647000	4649000	Cool
4649000	4651000	That's it
4651000	4653000	APB
4653000	4655000	It's kind of funny because people were pissed off
4655000	4657000	That this game actually kind of went under
4657000	4659000	Within about 3 months of its launch
4659000	4661000	And now it's been acquired by
4661000	4663000	Gamers First and they're relaunching
4663000	4665000	As APB Reloaded
4665000	4667000	In the first half of 2011
4667000	4669000	And what's kind of cool about it though
4669000	4671000	Is the game will actually be
4671000	4673000	A free to play
4673000	4675000	Iteration of the game
4675000	4677000	So lots of microtransactions
4677000	4679000	As well but hey you know what
4679000	4681000	That's awesome because
4681000	4683000	I would love that game to be free to play
4683000	4685000	It was pretty fun to begin with
4685000	4687000	But I couldn't see myself paying for it
4687000	4689000	Thank God I was too lazy to pay for it
4689000	4691000	This was a game that you were excited about
4691000	4693000	But you were like too lazy to get
4693000	4695000	Right?
4695000	4697000	Exactly
4697000	4699000	Nice
4699000	4701000	Or as Rama says in our chat room
4701000	4703000	APB rise from your grave
4703000	4705000	Get it?
4705000	4707000	Anyhow one more story
4707000	4709000	For you guys and we're going to get to the classic game of the week
4709000	4711000	But this is about a different type of classic
4711000	4713000	On the Wii
4713000	4715000	It's this whole super special
4715000	4717000	25th anniversary edition here
4717000	4719000	You know the Wii has
4719000	4721000	The 25th anniversary Mario collection
4721000	4723000	That comes with like a Mario collection
4723000	4725000	And Wii Sports
4725000	4727000	And the red controllers and all that
4727000	4729000	Here's the interesting thing though
4729000	4731000	Is that in Europe they got the Wii
4731000	4733000	And it came with New Super Mario Brothers
4733000	4735000	And Donkey Kong original
4735000	4737000	Edition
4737000	4739000	It was preloaded onto the Wii
4739000	4741000	It was kind of like a virtual console game
4741000	4743000	Because you know how Donkey Kong was on the NES
4743000	4745000	Originally right?
4745000	4747000	Well here's the interesting thing
4747000	4749000	Donkey Kong original edition
4749000	4751000	On the Wii that's coming out in Europe
4751000	4753000	Has the cement factory level
4753000	4755000	And you might be going
4755000	4757000	Okay well who cares about that?
4757000	4759000	Well that's because the cement factory level
4759000	4761000	Wasn't in the NES version of
4761000	4763000	Donkey Kong
4763000	4765000	So it's kind of weird because
4765000	4767000	It's very obvious I guess you can tell
4767000	4769000	From the way this kind of looks when you're playing the game
4769000	4771000	That it's not a port of the arcade game
4771000	4773000	But it's actually like an NES ROM
4773000	4775000	But it actually has the
4775000	4777000	Cement factory level in it
4777000	4779000	Which by the way I used to call the pie level
4779000	4781000	Because I'm the Commodore 64
4781000	4783000	That for whatever reason
4783000	4785000	Are going into burning oil
4785000	4787000	Just roll with me here
4787000	4789000	So yeah kind of weird that
4789000	4791000	Nintendo either knowingly or unknowingly
4791000	4793000	Kind of dug out this prototype
4793000	4795000	Donkey Kong game
4795000	4797000	That honestly never saw the light of day
4797000	4799000	In either continent
4799000	4801000	I think that's kind of cool actually
4801000	4803000	I mean whereas a lot of people are going to look at this
4803000	4805000	And go eh big deal a missing level shows up
4805000	4807000	In a game that's like what 25 years old now
4807000	4809000	I kind of go wait a minute though
4809000	4811000	Nintendo has this kind of shit in the vaults
4811000	4813000	And they're capable of putting it on
4813000	4815000	A service like virtual console
4815000	4817000	Why aren't they?
4819000	4821000	Like yeah we got
4821000	4823000	Some of these what Japanese
4823000	4825000	Games that never came out here in America
4825000	4827000	Or Europe or whatever the case may be
4827000	4829000	And like Sin and Punishment right
4829000	4831000	That was a big thing they did a couple years ago or last year
4831000	4833000	How about some of these
4833000	4835000	Unreleased Nintendo games that never saw
4835000	4837000	The light of day
4837000	4839000	Or here's something kind of interesting
4839000	4841000	Seeing as you know
4841000	4843000	They have the 25th anniversary edition
4843000	4845000	And the Super Mario All-Stars
4845000	4847000	Limited edition stuff coming out
4847000	4849000	Which by the way
4849000	4851000	Is just a port of the Super Nintendo game
4851000	4853000	Why couldn't they have ported over
4853000	4855000	I don't know the Super Nintendo
4855000	4857000	Cartridge that had both Super Mario World
4857000	4859000	And Super Mario All-Stars
4859000	4861000	You know a little bit extra to go in there
4861000	4863000	Seeing as you have a whole fucking disc
4863000	4865000	That you could pack full of stuff
4865000	4867000	Why would they do that
4867000	4869000	When they could just put in an ad
4869000	4871000	To go onto the virtual console marketplace
4871000	4873000	And spend 800 Wii Points
4873000	4875000	On that game
4875000	4877000	Why would they give you something for free Loki
4877000	4879000	You just want something for nothing
4879000	4881000	You want grateful kids
4881000	4883000	What they had for the game
4883000	4885000	They had the pre-order discs
4885000	4887000	Remember that you could get the two
4887000	4889000	Nintendo 64 Zelda games
4889000	4891000	And the two 8-Bit Zelda games
4891000	4893000	I don't understand why they can't
4893000	4895000	Oh I know because like you said
4895000	4897000	They're selling them on the virtual console
4897000	4899000	That's right
4899000	4901000	Rama in our chat room says it could be an unlock lol
4901000	4903000	I doubt it
4903000	4905000	By the way there is this
4905000	4907000	25th anniversary Super Mario
4907000	4909000	Brothers thing that they did
4909000	4911000	All they did they like changed the copyright
4911000	4913000	Date and they just kind of
4913000	4915000	Edited the question mark blocks to say
4915000	4917000	25
4917000	4919000	Basically it's a ROM hack
4919000	4921000	It's on that same level as
4921000	4923000	Super Penis Brothers
4923000	4925000	Where somebody took all the pictures of Mario
4925000	4927000	And turned them into penises
4927000	4929000	Which is freely available on the internet
4929000	4931000	So that's the business Nintendo is in now
4931000	4933000	Speaking of ROM hacks
4933000	4935000	I don't think we talked about it last week
4935000	4937000	New Super Mario Brothers
4937000	4939000	Someone ROM hacked the
4939000	4941000	DS ROM and made it
4941000	4943000	New Super Mario Brothers
4943000	4945000	I remember that coming up last week
4945000	4947000	That's sweet
4947000	4949000	See that's what you do
4949000	4951000	Because Mario All Stars
4951000	4953000	That's great that you made everything 16 bit
4953000	4955000	And stuff why don't you just
4955000	4957000	Update it again
4957000	4959000	Make it all like New Super Mario Brothers
4959000	4961000	So you have all the original levels
4961000	4963000	With Mario Brothers, the lost levels
4963000	4965000	Mario 2 and stuff like that
4965000	4967000	Make it all brand new
4967000	4969000	And guess what you could have sold it for
4969000	4971000	$50 instead of $30
4971000	4973000	Here's the thing
4973000	4975000	Because basically you're buying a $30 ROM
4975000	4977000	Or if they were going to do a ROM hack
4977000	4979000	With this 25th anniversary
4979000	4981000	They could have done a good ROM hack
4981000	4983000	You know some of the ones out there
4983000	4985000	They took the graphics from Mario 3
4985000	4987000	When Mario looked a lot sharper
4987000	4989000	And the sprites were kind of better
4989000	4991000	And put it in Mario 1
4991000	4993000	They should have done something like that
4993000	4995000	Or maybe they went back and redone the sprites
4995000	4997000	I'm not just talking about that
4997000	4999000	I'm talking about a ROM hack out there
4999000	5001000	That takes the Mario 3 sprites
5001000	5003000	And puts them in the Mario 1 game
5003000	5005000	This is just a little extra thing
5005000	5007000	For itself
5007000	5009000	Oh it's an extra bonus for buying the actual console
5009000	5011000	It's this 25th anniversary edition
5011000	5013000	Of Mario Bros
5013000	5015000	Which by the way the ROM will probably be floating around out there
5015000	5017000	As if it really needs to be
5017000	5019000	Because it's just a simple ROM hack
5019000	5021000	But
5021000	5023000	I don't know
5023000	5025000	It's just
5025000	5027000	It's neat I guess
5027000	5029000	But it's not that unique
5031000	5033000	Alright well it's a bummer
5033000	5035000	It's probably never going to go anywhere past this
5035000	5037000	Wow that's kind of cool
5037000	5039000	I'm telling you somebody just grabbed the wrong damn file
5039000	5041000	Is probably what happened
5041000	5043000	With this whole prototype getting released
5043000	5045000	Somebody grabbed the wrong damn file
5045000	5047000	And didn't even know what they were doing
5047000	5049000	Alright anyhow let's get into
5049000	5051000	Speaking of classic stuff
5051000	5053000	I know we're talking about Donkey Kong
5053000	5055000	But I think Dark Soccer wants to take a trip down memory lane
5055000	5057000	And point out a different game
5057000	5059000	She says hey
5059000	5061000	Listen up kids
5061000	5063000	Grateful brats that don't know what a pie factory is
5063000	5065000	There's a game out there
5065000	5067000	That you should be checking out and playing
5067000	5069000	And showing a little love this week
5069000	5071000	Although I gotta say I think a lot of the kids
5071000	5073000	Know about this one but if they forgot
5073000	5075000	It's time they remember
5075000	5077000	I think that we should actually start this one off with the music
5077000	5079000	I think we should too so let me pull up the music
5079000	5081000	If they don't get it then
5081000	5083000	Yes the game of the week is
5083000	5085000	Bubble Bobble
5085000	5087000	Which I could have sworn I've done before
5087000	5089000	But I don't think I did so here it is
5089000	5091000	Bubble Bobble was put out by Taito
5091000	5093000	It came out in 1986
5093000	5095000	And came out on Damn Near Everything
5095000	5097000	There are bubble dragons named Bub and Bob
5097000	5099000	Or as they were in Japan
5099000	5101000	There was Babarune
5101000	5103000	And Babarune
5103000	5105000	And Babarune
5105000	5107000	And Babarune
5107000	5109000	And Babarune
5109000	5111000	And Babarune
5111000	5113000	And Babarune
5113000	5115000	So same diff
5115000	5117000	And basically they spit out bubbles
5117000	5119000	And push them around
5119000	5121000	And smack their enemies
5121000	5123000	And there's been many
5123000	5125000	Many many games in their series
5125000	5127000	So yeah basically
5127000	5129000	You blow the bubbles
5129000	5131000	You can trap the enemies in the bubbles
5131000	5133000	And you can push them to
5133000	5135000	Burst the bubbles
5135000	5137000	And make the enemies fall off
5137000	5139000	And the enemies
5139000	5141000	The bubbles with the enemies and it can float
5141000	5143000	So you can jump on them all
5143000	5145000	Use them to get to hard to reach places
5145000	5147000	Or pop many of them at a time
5147000	5149000	But if they're
5149000	5151000	If they're the last one left on the screen
5151000	5153000	They get angry
5153000	5155000	And change color
5155000	5157000	And then you have to bop them
5157000	5159000	And they're harder to get
5159000	5161000	Some of them have rocks, lasers, fireballs
5161000	5163000	For projectiles
5163000	5165000	But sometimes you have
5165000	5167000	Different things like water
5167000	5169000	And lightning
5169000	5171000	Little balls that you can smack them around with
5171000	5173000	As far
5173000	5175000	As ports there have been a
5175000	5177000	Bajillion like I said
5177000	5179000	And that's the technical term for it
5179000	5181000	There's been Commodore 64
5181000	5183000	Sinclair ZX Spectrum
5183000	5185000	Amiga Atari ST MSX
5185000	5187000	Armstrad CPC
5187000	5189000	Sharp X68000
5189000	5191000	PC there was a
5191000	5193000	DOS one in
5193000	5195000	1989 and in 1996
5195000	5197000	There was I think another one
5197000	5199000	Apple II
5199000	5201000	FM Towns Marty Sega Master System
5201000	5203000	Game Boy Game Boy Color Game Boy
5203000	5205000	Advanced Nintendo DS
5205000	5207000	PlayStation Sega Saturn
5207000	5209000	NES Famicom Disc
5209000	5211000	Game Gear Mobile Phone
5211000	5213000	TI 80 whatever calculators
5213000	5215000	And it came out
5215000	5217000	On the Ultra K Taito arcade classics
5217000	5219000	There's also one for the BBC
5219000	5221000	Micro that
5221000	5223000	Never actually got released
5223000	5225000	Taito said in
5225000	5227000	1996 that they lost the
5227000	5229000	Original source code
5229000	5231000	And um
5231000	5233000	Probe
5233000	5235000	Was actually
5235000	5237000	Sent that so that they
5237000	5239000	Could reproduce the mechanics
5239000	5241000	And that also meant that later on
5241000	5243000	Uh
5243000	5245000	There were re-releases of
5245000	5247000	Rainbow Islands for Saturn, PlayStation
5247000	5249000	And PC in 1996
5249000	5251000	The Game Boy
5251000	5253000	Game Boy Color versions have a water moon
5253000	5255000	Storyline and it's known as
5255000	5257000	Bubble Bobble in classic Bubble Bobble
5257000	5259000	And there's a
5259000	5261000	Like I said there was one for the TI-83
5261000	5263000	Graphing calculator that someone made which I
5263000	5265000	Think I had
5265000	5267000	At one time till my graphing calculator
5267000	5269000	Died um there was
5269000	5271000	Uh Xbox PS2
5271000	5273000	PC for the Taito Legends
5273000	5275000	Compilation um
5275000	5277000	It was on mobile phones in Europe and Japan
5277000	5279000	And then it came out
5279000	5281000	On the Virtual Console
5281000	5283000	There were also broken versions later on
5283000	5285000	Like uh ones that wouldn't let you get past
5285000	5287000	Level 30
5287000	5289000	Yes seriously
5289000	5291000	As far as other games that came
5291000	5293000	Out in the series
5293000	5295000	Let's move on to those we have
5295000	5297000	Rainbow Islands the Bubble
5297000	5299000	The story of Bubble Bobble 2
5299000	5301000	We have Rainbow Islands extra versions
5301000	5303000	Parasol Stars which originally came out
5303000	5305000	On the PC Engine and I know where you can get a copy
5305000	5307000	In town and they want 70 bucks for it
5307000	5309000	And I'm like no!
5309000	5311000	Which by the way if it feels like you've done this game before
5311000	5313000	It's because you did Parasol Stars
5313000	5315000	I did do Parasol Stars
5315000	5317000	Parasol Stars is a great game
5317000	5319000	And there's also Bubble Bobble Part 2
5319000	5321000	Bubble Bobble 2 slash Bubble Symphony
5321000	5323000	Um Bubble Memories the story of
5323000	5325000	Bubble Bobble 3
5325000	5327000	Rainbow Islands Putty's Party
5327000	5329000	Which was on the Wonderswan and I think
5329000	5331000	I have it I have to check
5331000	5333000	I've got some Wonderswan games I don't remember what I have
5333000	5335000	Rainbow Islands Towering Adventure
5335000	5337000	And Bubble Bobble Plus which is a WiiWare game
5337000	5339000	And also Bubble Bobble Neo
5339000	5341000	Is the same version that came out on
5341000	5343000	Xbox Live Arcade
5343000	5345000	And that is Bubble Bobble
5345000	5347000	Okay yeah there's
5347000	5349000	There are quite a number
5349000	5351000	And don't forget about the related
5351000	5353000	Ones in the series
5353000	5355000	There was Puzzle Bobble
5357000	5359000	Which was over here Bust a Move
5359000	5361000	Mhmm
5361000	5363000	Which is a really dumb name
5363000	5365000	For the game
5365000	5367000	There was Azumanga Puzzle Daioh
5367000	5369000	After the Azumanga Daioh
5369000	5371000	Which is also in the series
5371000	5373000	So
5373000	5375000	Puzzle de Pon, Fairyland Story
5375000	5377000	And Check and Pop
5377000	5379000	Similar
5379000	5381000	Your classic game of the week boys and girls
5381000	5383000	Bubble Bobble on like every system ever made
5383000	5385000	But is there
5385000	5387000	A certain system that you prefer above
5387000	5389000	All others
5389000	5391000	I would say original arcade
5391000	5393000	But that's
5393000	5395000	Yeah well I can tell you what
5395000	5397000	What my favorite in the
5397000	5399000	Series was and what system I played it on
5399000	5401000	Was Puzzle Bobble 2 on Saturn
5401000	5403000	I played a crap ton
5403000	5405000	Of Puzzle Bobble 2 on the Saturn
5405000	5407000	Seriously
5407000	5409000	I would just sit on the floor in front of Danzel TV
5409000	5411000	And just do nothing but play it
5411000	5413000	And there's so many clones of that game now
5413000	5415000	I know I have a free one on the iPhone
5415000	5417000	Crazy stuff

5481000	5483000	All the less

5503000	5505000	That's all I'm gonna say
5505000	5507000	Anyhow let's get back into some more gaming news
5507000	5509000	Here we got some rapid news
5509000	5511000	We're gonna get to and then Twitter topics
5511000	5513000	So if you haven't gotten your Twitter topics in
5513000	5515000	Send us a tweet
5515000	5517000	And we're gonna get to those in just about 10 minutes
5517000	5519000	But first some quick news stories
5519000	5521000	Starting with Loki
5521000	5523000	Rock of the Dead
5523000	5525000	The game that actually uses the guitar peripheral
5525000	5527000	For something other than playing guitar
5527000	5529000	Is now possibly coming to Facebook
5529000	5531000	Apparently Epicenter
5531000	5533000	On Conspiracies game
5533000	5535000	Is kind of a little bit like
5535000	5537000	Typing of the Dead
5537000	5539000	Except with the guitar type controller
5539000	5541000	And it is gonna be coming
5541000	5543000	Of course in a guitar less
5543000	5545000	Version sometime in 2011
5545000	5547000	And apparently development
5547000	5549000	Is started
5549000	5551000	Or is slated to start Q1
5551000	5553000	Of next year
5553000	5555000	And it's a few
5555000	5557000	They say it's a Facebook game
5557000	5559000	So what a couple weeks after that
5559000	5561000	So that's kind of neat I guess
5561000	5563000	It'd be something different to play
5563000	5565000	On Facebook
5565000	5567000	Rock band
5567000	5569000	This week has some pretty cool stuff

5635000	5637000	Well Ark Arena
5637000	5639000	I guess it was an offshoot of the series
5639000	5641000	Will be
5641000	5643000	Can be purchased with Ark the Lad 2
5643000	5645000	For $8.99
5645000	5647000	I don't know if the other

5649000	5651000	But
5651000	5653000	That'll be coming Tuesday November 23rd
5657000	5659000	That's very soon to see now
5659000	5661000	Yes a couple days away
5661000	5663000	Some of the quick stories here
5663000	5665000	This one is about
5665000	5667000	Hold on I have to have an excuse to play this song
5667000	5669000	I've been doing this show for what almost 9 years now
5669000	5671000	And I don't know if I've ever had an excuse to play this song
5673000	5675000	Let's see here
5675000	5677000	Gotta pull it up real quick
5677000	5679000	And here we go
5679000	5681000	We played this once in Marching Band
5687000	5689000	That's right it's a Monty Python story
5689000	5691000	Yes we've managed to find a
5691000	5693000	Story about video games and Monty Python
5693000	5695000	Of course it might not be the
5695000	5697000	Type of video games you're really into
5697000	5699000	But it's a UK company called
5699000	5701000	Zatika
5701000	5703000	Which is trying to make a social
5703000	5705000	Game based out of the Monty
5705000	5707000	Python license
5707000	5709000	They also have games called
5709000	5711000	Buttscan
5711000	5713000	Yes that's right Buttscan
5713000	5715000	And Mr. Bean out of control
5715000	5717000	That's already being made for
5717000	5719000	The iOS stuff
5719000	5721000	So I don't know whatever
5721000	5723000	Here's a quote from the press release
5723000	5725000	Monty Python is one of the most iconic
5725000	5727000	Comedy licenses around but there has been no new
5727000	5729000	Material for over 20 years
5729000	5731000	By acquiring these rights we will be transporting
5731000	5733000	Monty Python into the 21st century
5733000	5735000	With a totally new experience for their unique
5735000	5737000	Comedy that will delight old and new
5737000	5739000	Fans alike. Forget Web 2.0
5739000	5741000	This is Python 2.1 and 3.25
5745000	5747000	Well you know what
5747000	5749000	They did something a while back called
5749000	5751000	Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time
5751000	5753000	I do remember that
5753000	5755000	And it had the desktop pythonizer that
5755000	5757000	Turned every other sound on your keyboard into farts
5757000	5759000	And a game called
5759000	5761000	Spam
5761000	5763000	Which filled your screen with a giant can of spam
5763000	5765000	And says try to locate the kind of spam
5767000	5769000	I love Monty Python
5769000	5771000	But this game will probably
5771000	5773000	Be about the parrot sketch or something
5773000	5775000	That's been just beaten into the ground
5775000	5777000	Speaking of things beaten into the ground
5777000	5779000	Are you suggesting that the parrot is dead?
5779000	5781000	This is an
5781000	5783000	Expedite
5783000	5785000	Anyhow
5785000	5787000	This might be an ex MMO pretty soon
5787000	5789000	Final Fantasy 14
5789000	5791000	Has extended their free trial
5791000	5793000	For yet another 30 days
5793000	5795000	This is the second time
5795000	5797000	They've done this and they have
5797000	5799000	Promised that there's a big update coming
5799000	5801000	On November 25th
5801000	5803000	So this 30 days is a
5803000	5805000	Thank you to the existing fan base
5805000	5807000	For sticking with it through all this crap
5807000	5809000	It'd be hilarious
5809000	5811000	Isn't November 25th like Thanksgiving?
5811000	5813000	Wouldn't it be hilarious if the
5813000	5815000	Update wasn't actually an update
5815000	5817000	The fix on the 22nd, Monday, 23rd, Tuesday
5817000	5819000	The 25th is Thanksgiving, they're putting in a patch
5819000	5821000	And I mean I realize it's probably
5821000	5823000	In Japan and they don't really have the same holidays
5823000	5825000	We do but it's still just kind of funny to me
5825000	5827000	But wouldn't it be funny though if the new update wasn't
5827000	5829000	Exactly one to fix all the bugs
5829000	5831000	It was just like the holiday event
5831000	5833000	Right, right. It's a big update
5833000	5835000	There's now snowmen
5835000	5837000	Yes, but no auction house
5837000	5839000	No auction house
5839000	5841000	Snowmen and fireworks
5841000	5843000	Santa costume
5843000	5845000	There's a whole thread
5845000	5847000	Actually now I'm curious, I gotta look at what is
5847000	5849000	Coming in the November update
5849000	5851000	There's also another update coming in December
5851000	5853000	Wow
5853000	5855000	The update's actually just a download
5855000	5857000	For Final Fantasy XI
5857000	5859000	That's right, they are making changes to
5859000	5861000	Events and battles
5861000	5863000	UI, they're changing
5863000	5865000	The macro functions, some new map features
5865000	5867000	You can now expand and
5867000	5869000	Collapse your map
5869000	5871000	That sounds useful
5871000	5873000	Also the map
5873000	5875000	The mouse will now scroll your map
5875000	5877000	That also sounds very useful
5877000	5879000	The left mouse button
5879000	5881000	Has been enabled for use
5881000	5883000	Good job Square
5883000	5885000	For making my mouse
5885000	5887000	Look, I realize the game was developed for a system
5887000	5889000	That has no mouse, but come on
5889000	5891000	The ability to turn left has been added to our
5891000	5893000	Make sure
5895000	5897000	No longer will you have to
5897000	5899000	Sprint, but the walking
5899000	5901000	Functionality will be enabled
5901000	5903000	I know there's a
5903000	5905000	Hardcore Final Fantasy XIV fan out there
5905000	5907000	Listening to this show going, you guys are assholes
5907000	5909000	You guys are just assholes, you don't understand
5909000	5911000	Out of the ability
5911000	5913000	To use your right leg
5913000	5915000	Rob, that little voice that you did
5915000	5917000	Just sounded like Dane Cook's
5917000	5919000	Impersonation of himself in the womb
5919000	5921000	Don't you ever compare me to
5921000	5923000	Dane Cook ever again
5923000	5925000	I can't help that is what you sounded like
5925000	5927000	Don't you ever
5927000	5929000	Moving on
5929000	5931000	Ziba in our chatroom says
5931000	5933000	I still don't think they have chocobos yet
5933000	5935000	Isn't it mandatory in Final Fantasy games
5935000	5937000	Like you have to have a chocobo somewhere
5937000	5939000	Even the fucking Facebook games have chocobos
5939000	5941000	No, no, no, they're not chocobos anymore
5941000	5943000	Now they're just giant turkeys
5943000	5945000	Remember, because it's all the same, but different
5945000	5947000	Just like, you know
5947000	5949000	That's right, they're now called
5949000	5951000	Chocobocos
5951000	5953000	Chocobocos
5953000	5955000	Chocobocos
5955000	5957000	Yeah
5957000	5959000	They're very, very buff
5959000	5961000	They're muscle bound and wearing spandex
5963000	5965000	Loki should design an MMO
5965000	5967000	He really should
5967000	5969000	My MMO would be awesome
5969000	5971000	What would your MMO be all about?
5971000	5973000	I don't know, it'd be very freeform
5973000	5975000	Now we don't want to necessarily rip off
5975000	5977000	Freeform like that
5977000	5979000	It's like second
5979000	5981000	Organized chaos, if you will
5981000	5983000	I don't know
5983000	5985000	I'd start off with a traditional MMO
5985000	5987000	And then I would take suggestions
5987000	5989000	I would take most of those suggestions
5989000	5991000	Alright, anyhow
5991000	5993000	I had my own
5993000	5995000	Random things
5995000	5997000	Now who's interrupting who?
5997000	5999000	You asked, I wasn't done talking
5999000	6001000	So technically you are interrupting me
6001000	6003000	Let me finish
6003000	6005000	Let me finish
6005000	6007000	I'm finished
6009000	6011000	Are you really finished?
6011000	6013000	God damn you
6013000	6015000	Amaze Satsuma says
6015000	6017000	I want a turducken made out of turkey bows
6017000	6019000	There you go
6019000	6021000	Chocobos have now been replaced with turduckens
6021000	6023000	And no, my MMO would not be like
6023000	6025000	Bonetown, Bonetown is lame
6025000	6027000	My MMO is not lame
6027000	6029000	Salacious pop
6029000	6031000	Salacious pop
6031000	6033000	Salacious pop
6033000	6035000	In our chat
6035000	6037000	I'm assuming this is about the Loki MMO
6037000	6039000	I'm a dual spec
6039000	6041000	Bacon baron and titty hound
6043000	6045000	Oh, so you're Loki's wife
6047000	6049000	Alright
6049000	6051000	Anyhow, moving on
6051000	6053000	Hey
6053000	6055000	More Blizzard news that isn't WoW
6055000	6057000	This is about Diablo
6057000	6059000	And apparently
6059000	6061000	There might be, there could possibly
6061000	6063000	Be the possibility
6063000	6065000	That Diablo might
6065000	6067000	Maybe happen on consoles
6067000	6069000	Here's
6069000	6071000	Here's the company's official response
6071000	6097000	To speculation
6097000	6099000	Funny, I know someone that
6099000	6101000	Would be very
6101000	6103000	Appropriate for that
6103000	6105000	It's a studio called Bizarre Creations
6105000	6107000	Unfortunately you just
6107000	6109000	Fired them, so
6109000	6111000	Yeah, it's a little awkward
6111000	6113000	Yeah, I'm sure
6113000	6115000	That Diablo would be perfect for consoles
6115000	6117000	Because it would make them lots of money
6117000	6119000	I mean, seriously, if they thought Bloodstone
6119000	6121000	Was a good idea
6121000	6123000	Then Diablo is gonna be a great idea
6123000	6125000	Now, please
6125000	6127000	Note that Blizzard made it very clear
6127000	6129000	On the job posting itself
6129000	6131000	Quote, please note this is
6131000	6133000	Not an announcement of a console title
6133000	6135000	We are first and foremost developing
6135000	6137000	Diablo 3 for Windows and Macs
6137000	6139000	PCs, and don't intend to allow
6139000	6141000	Any possibility of a console interpretation
6141000	6143000	To delay or affect the release of that game
6143000	6145000	Yes, we first and foremost are developing
6145000	6147000	That, and then we're gonna develop
6147000	6149000	The console version, which we just announced
6149000	6151000	Right now, Diablo Ghost coming
6151000	6153000	Soon everybody, Diablo Ghost
6153000	6155000	Soon on a console near you
6155000	6157000	Check it out
6157000	6159000	Or don't
6159000	6161000	DarkSakura, what do you got for us before we get to Twitter topics?
6161000	6163000	Stuff and nonsense
6163000	6165000	How about an arcade game called
6165000	6167000	Let's Connect
6167000	6169000	It, um, basically
6169000	6171000	It was at the
6171000	6173000	IAPPA
6173000	6175000	Man, that's gonna be kind of a tone twister
6175000	6177000	Trade show, and it uses
6177000	6179000	The Kinect to
6179000	6181000	Play things that are like
6181000	6183000	I guess the Nintendo's Play Choice 10
6183000	6185000	Cabinets, you know, you can pick your game
6185000	6187000	And, um
6187000	6189000	So, it's not actually official
6189000	6191000	Microsoft thing, but
6191000	6193000	The manufacturer Quasimodo Interactive
6193000	6195000	Um
6195000	6197000	Needed the license to play
6197000	6199000	The games publicly, so
6199000	6201000	I don't know how well that's
6201000	6203000	Gonna work, but it's a neat idea
6203000	6205000	And then, uh, Kingdom Hearts
6205000	6207000	3D will have
6207000	6209000	New Disney World
6209000	6211000	Ooh
6211000	6213000	They are, uh
6213000	6215000	It's gonna have, uh
6215000	6217000	It's gonna be, of course, on the 3DS
6217000	6219000	And it will have Sora and Riku
6219000	6221000	And, um
6221000	6223000	They're just gonna be different places
6223000	6225000	I would say that they have to
6225000	6227000	Pan out
6227000	6229000	But this is, but they're gonna
6229000	6231000	You know, still have the Traverse Town
6231000	6233000	And all the other places still be there
6233000	6235000	But, new places
6235000	6237000	They could do a zone on Princess and the Frog
6237000	6239000	And some of the new things that have come out, but
6239000	6241000	At Cauldron level
6241000	6243000	How about, uh, since there is a new Tron movie
6243000	6245000	I'm just saying, the Tron universe can be revisited
6245000	6247000	I know!
6247000	6249000	The Space Paranoids level needs to be updated
6249000	6251000	Seriously, Disney, if you want a really
6251000	6253000	Good primetime animated series
6253000	6255000	Boom! There it is
6255000	6257000	I'm surprised that hasn't happened, actually
6257000	6259000	It would be awesome
6259000	6261000	There's manga already
6261000	6263000	Yeah, that's pretty cool, but
6263000	6265000	I mean, seriously
6265000	6267000	You get their animation team behind it
6267000	6269000	And you could do something really
6269000	6297000	Awesome
6297000	6299000	Awesome while we were cleaning, Axel
6299000	6301000	Hot
6301000	6303000	Because, I mean, seriously, it's a great series
6303000	6305000	To get people at sea may not be
6305000	6307000	I have another story
6307000	6309000	Interested in the characters
6309000	6311000	Back, you know, into those characters
6311000	6313000	And in other news
6313000	6315000	Star Trek Online
6315000	6317000	Season 3! Yay!
6317000	6319000	Didn't season 2 just come out?
6319000	6321000	A couple months ago
6321000	6323000	But they've just finished up
6323000	6325000	Some of the new episodes
6325000	6327000	I actually just finished the Davidian
6327000	6329000	Missions, and it actually takes some kind of
6329000	6331000	Lame psychic energy
6331000	6333000	Stealing creatures from the next generation
6333000	6335000	And makes them actually pretty cool and
6335000	6337000	Badass in a very Silent Hill
6337000	6339000	Level sort of thing, it was really cool
6339000	6341000	Well, I guess that's kind of cool that they're supporting it
6341000	6343000	As well as they are
6343000	6345000	They put out the scary ones for around Halloween, it was really neat
6345000	6347000	Season 4 is going to be entirely in the holodeck
6347000	6349000	And it's going to be set in the Wild West
6349000	6351000	The server's called the holodeck
6351000	6353000	Our server's called the holodeck
6353000	6355000	Our test server's called Tribble
6355000	6357000	At any rate
6357000	6359000	Can I play on the Zachary Quinto server?
6359000	6361000	Actually, he does voices for a character
6361000	6363000	Right at the beginning of the game
6363000	6365000	The emergency medical hologram
6365000	6367000	I'll be playing that level with the lights off
6367000	6369000	Anyway
6369000	6371000	What is your emergency?
6371000	6373000	As I was saying
6373000	6375000	The third season
6375000	6377000	Starts on December 9th
6377000	6379000	And has a mission
6379000	6381000	Creation beta
6381000	6383000	So it's for the
6383000	6385000	Foundry is what it's called
6385000	6387000	There's also going to be unlockable Borg tech
6387000	6389000	Mission replay
6389000	6391000	Which is what I'm looking for
6391000	6393000	Shut up Rob
6393000	6395000	I'm laughing at what you said, not what you said
6395000	6397000	But I'm looking forward to the mission replay
6397000	6399000	Because there were some pretty fun missions
6399000	6401000	There's also going to be one thing that's not in this little piece
6401000	6403000	That I was reading up on
6403000	6405000	The Star Trek Online forums
6405000	6407000	They're going to have extra accolades
6407000	6409000	And different prizes you can get for
6409000	6411000	Your ship builder missions
6411000	6413000	And making changes to some of them
6413000	6415000	Based on your rank and that type of thing
6415000	6417000	So it's looking pretty good
6417000	6419000	They've also got
6419000	6421000	Some sort of online ship builder thing too
6421000	6423000	And don't forget about translating your tweets into Klingon
6423000	6425000	I'm sorry I'm not programmed to do that
6425000	6427000	Oh, you know what they just released
6427000	6429000	Which I thought was absolutely retarded
6429000	6431000	I mean, not even just retarded
6431000	6433000	But retarded
6433000	6435000	They released the Enterprise
6435000	6437000	Outfit packs
6437000	6439000	Vulcan chick
6439000	6441000	I'm like, dude, that series sucked
6441000	6443000	I did get the 7 of 9 outfit though
6443000	6445000	I will put pictures up
6445000	6447000	On our website soon
6447000	6449000	You can have 7 of 9
6449000	6451000	But I can't have Zulu
6451000	6453000	You can just have her outfit
6453000	6455000	Where everybody gets goatees
6455000	6457000	The evil pack
6457000	6459000	The evil pack
6459000	6461000	Tyra Crew gets goatees
6461000	6463000	I like that
6463000	6465000	Did anyone ever have a goatee in Star Trek except for him?
6465000	6467000	I don't remember
6467000	6469000	Everyone in Star Trek was fairly clean shaven
6469000	6471000	Except for Riker
6471000	6473000	The old school Klingons
6473000	6475000	They all had those weird sort of
6475000	6477000	Goatees
6477000	6479000	And now most of the Klingons have uberbeards
6479000	6481000	Alright, anyhow
6481000	6483000	Let's not turn this into a Star Trek show
6483000	6485000	As much as Star Trek would like that
6485000	6487000	Let's go to the Twitter
6487000	6489000	Every week you guys send us your tweets
6489000	6491000	Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
6491000	6493000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
6493000	6495000	13forever
6495000	6497000	13crossforever
6497000	6499000	13xforever
6499000	6501000	Sends us some tweets
6501000	6503000	Wants to alert us to the whole Age of Empires 3 for 10 cents
6503000	6505000	As a lot of people have been doing today
6505000	6507000	Just gamers wanting to spread the word about next to free ship
6507000	6509000	But he also wanted to point out
6509000	6511000	Game for Windows Marketplace also has
6511000	6513000	Bioshock 2 for $9.99
6513000	6515000	And some cheap add-ons for it
6515000	6517000	So I guess the 10 cent deal
6517000	6519000	Is not the only deal out there
6519000	6521000	I think Bioshock 1 was available for $1.99
6521000	6523000	For a day somewhere
6523000	6525000	Probably on Steam
6525000	6527000	See, this is the one reason I support
6527000	6529000	This whole Game for Windows thing
6529000	6531000	Because competition, we're all gonna win
6531000	6533000	With these companies
6533000	6535000	Trying to undercut each other
6535000	6537000	It's gonna be awesome
6537000	6539000	Zebo wanted to alert us to the Final Fantasy 14
6539000	6541000	Free trial will be extended again
6541000	6543000	But I already covered that
6543000	6545000	Thanks for trying
6545000	6547000	Let's see, Retertainment for whatever reason
6547000	6549000	Just sent us a tweet that is a picture of Pito Bear
6549000	6551000	In the TSA logo
6551000	6553000	Saying the U.S. Department of Molestation
6553000	6555000	I don't know if I find that funny
6555000	6557000	Just kidding, it's funny
6557000	6559000	Pito Bear is always funny
6559000	6561000	My favorite though, nothing will ever top
6561000	6563000	The Pito Bear on the Trader Joe's price tag
6563000	6565000	It was like for honey
6565000	6567000	Or something
6569000	6571000	I'm sorry, it was funny
6571000	6573000	Let's see, TigerClaw sends us a couple of stories
6573000	6575000	On the tweeters
6575000	6577000	One of this is about a really cool hack
6577000	6579000	I'm surprised he didn't say anything about this yet
6579000	6581000	But apparently it's using the Open Connect drivers
6581000	6583000	I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that
6583000	6585000	Apparently used the Open Connect drivers
6585000	6587000	And image processing
6587000	6589000	To create a lightsaber effect
6589000	6591000	On his PC
6591000	6593000	Out of a wooden stick
6593000	6595000	And so the Kinect tracks the wooden stick
6595000	6597000	And replaces it with a lightsaber
6597000	6599000	That is awesome, sir
6599000	6601000	You win the internet
6601000	6603000	And yet, how long is it gonna take for the real lightsaber game
6603000	6605000	To come out, especially with all these layoffs
6605000	6607000	Later next year
6607000	6609000	By the way, there's a YouTube out there
6609000	6611000	So of course I'm gonna turn it on and watch this guy
6611000	6613000	Oh, this is way better than Star Wars, kid
6613000	6615000	Just saying
6615000	6617000	It's actually kinda awesome
6617000	6619000	It's kind of
6619000	6621000	The delay on that is not as terrible as you'd think
6621000	6623000	I mean, it's not totally fluid
6623000	6625000	But it's not horrible
6625000	6627000	Kinda neat, I like that
6627000	6629000	They're just early drivers, they'll get better
6629000	6631000	Again, our Twitter
6631000	6633000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
6633000	6635000	O-L-R
6635000	6637000	Another tweet from Tiger Claw
6637000	6639000	Sending us this one about Pac-Man
6639000	6641000	It's another Pac-Man story, but it's not about Pac-Man Championship Edition DX
6641000	6643000	It is about the Rose Parade
6643000	6645000	Yeah, Namco Bandai
6645000	6647000	Has said that a 55 foot tall display
6647000	6649000	Featuring Pac-Man and
6649000	6651000	Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde
6651000	6653000	Is going to be one of the first
6653000	6655000	I'm sorry, the first video game focused
6655000	6657000	Float in the 122 year old
6657000	6659000	Tournament of Roses parade
6659000	6661000	It's because of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary
6661000	6663000	There's going to be a cake toting
6663000	6665000	Pac-Man surrounded by presents
6665000	6667000	And standing atop a bright and colorful
6667000	6669000	Cornucopia of floral arrangements
6669000	6671000	You have to remember, it's the Rose Parade
6671000	6673000	There's tons of floral arrangements on every float
6673000	6675000	So, that's kinda cool
6675000	6677000	And if you want to see that on TV
6677000	6679000	8 AM Pacific time on Saturday
6679000	6681000	New Year's Day
6681000	6683000	That's right, you have to get up at 8 AM
6683000	6685000	Or set your TiVo
6685000	6687000	Or just wait for the YouTube that will inevitably show up on all the gaming blogs
6687000	6689000	There you go
6689000	6691000	Anyway, Sonic the Hedgehog was the first
6691000	6693000	Video game character that ever had a balloon
6693000	6695000	But that was in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade
6695000	6697000	That's a whole other parade
6697000	6699000	Pikachu was also in that parade
6699000	6701000	But in 2001
6701000	6703000	And then escaped and killed everybody
6703000	6705000	Yes, it did
6705000	6707000	But no one wants to report on that
6707000	6709000	Let's see, Spazenator
6709000	6711000	PSN wants us to note
6711000	6713000	That there is a release that didn't get mentioned earlier
6713000	6715000	The Magic the Gathering game
6715000	6717000	That is on Xbox Live Arcade is being ported
6717000	6719000	To PSN this Tuesday
6719000	6721000	And he sends a follow-up tweet
6721000	6723000	Saying, I recommend the Magic the Gathering
6723000	6725000	PSN game for those who don't already have it
6725000	6727000	On Xbox Live Arcade or like
6727000	6729000	The Magic the Gathering card game
6729000	6731000	Yeah, it was a pretty faithful translation
6731000	6733000	It's kinda hard to translate an intricate
6733000	6735000	Card game like that when cards can be played
6735000	6737000	At a variety of times
6737000	6739000	To a console, but they did a pretty decent job
6739000	6741000	Even though I think
6741000	6743000	It plays a little faster in real life
6743000	6745000	But still kinda neat
6745000	6747000	And certainly a lot cheaper
6747000	6749000	Oh my god, trying to collect those cards?
6749000	6751000	Geez
6751000	6753000	So I think that's gonna close it for the Twitter
6753000	6755000	I'm doing one last refresh to make sure we don't get any last minute tweets
6755000	6757000	Nope, I don't see any
6757000	6759000	So I hope that's not a bug or whatever
6759000	6761000	But yeah, Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets in the future
6761000	6763000	In the meantime
6763000	6765000	Some more news stories for you guys
6765000	6767000	Then we're gonna be getting to the Skype line in a little bit
6767000	6769000	At 1-877-GAME-OLR
6769000	6771000	But first, Loki
6771000	6773000	Ah, yes
6773000	6775000	Um, I don't know what to think of this
6775000	6777000	I honestly didn't play the first game
6777000	6779000	But this doesn't sound
6779000	6781000	Very close to the original image
6781000	6783000	Of Yars' Revenge
6783000	6785000	Uh, Yars' Revenge is being made
6785000	6787000	Or remade into an anime-inspired rail shooter
6787000	6789000	Um
6789000	6791000	Honestly
6791000	6793000	It
6793000	6795000	It seems like
6795000	6797000	A stretch to me
6797000	6799000	I was making the joke earlier saying that
6799000	6801000	It really should have been about an angry pirate
6801000	6803000	But, um
6803000	6805000	YARRRR
6805000	6807000	YARRR I will have my revenge
6807000	6809000	But, uh, yeah
6809000	6811000	It's supposed to be like some sort of
6811000	6813000	You know, they're saying like
6813000	6815000	Like a Xeno saga
6815000	6817000	Or something like that
6817000	6819000	I don't know
6819000	6821000	It seems like a stretch to me
6821000	6823000	Um, it's kinda weird
6823000	6825000	Because Yars' Revenge was like
6825000	6827000	Probably one of the greatest Atari 2600 games
6827000	6829000	There ever was
6829000	6831000	That wasn't by Activision
6831000	6833000	Um, I've never played it
6833000	6835000	It's cool, but you know
6835000	6837000	You play it now
6837000	6839000	And you go like, there's not a lot to this
6839000	6841000	What is this? But you have to remember
6841000	6843000	Atari 2600 games were very straightforward
6843000	6845000	Back in the day, I mean
6845000	6847000	Games were four kilobytes
6847000	6849000	In size back then
6849000	6851000	You write essays now that are longer than that
6851000	6853000	You know what I mean? Like, they had to cram a lot
6853000	6855000	In those little cartridges, so most of the games were
6855000	6857000	Very straightforward
6857000	6859000	So fine, they're reinventing it or whatever
6859000	6861000	But this whole like, anime chick
6861000	6863000	And rail shooter, like, doesn't seem to be
6863000	6865000	At all similar
6865000	6867000	To what was there before
6867000	6869000	As long as there's like, some
6869000	6871000	Resemblance to the original game
6871000	6873000	I would approve
6873000	6875000	But I have a bad feeling I'm not gonna be seeing that
6875000	6877000	Yeah
6877000	6879000	I mean, I guess a good game's a good game
6879000	6881000	No matter what they do artistically
6881000	6883000	With it, but I just
6883000	6885000	I think y'all can see where we're all a little
6885000	6887000	Apprehensive
6887000	6889000	But we'll see, we have yet to really
6889000	6891000	See gameplay, the only trailer that's come
6891000	6893000	Out so far is this weird announcement video
6893000	6895000	Right? Yes. So
6895000	6897000	We'll see when gameplay comes out
6897000	6899000	That's true, Dungeon Busters
6899000	6901000	In our chatroom saying, there was more
6901000	6903000	Story in the manual than there was in the
6903000	6905000	Actual Yars Revenge game, very true
6905000	6907000	Very true point
6909000	6911000	Alright, moving on to another story
6911000	6913000	Talk about more old
6913000	6915000	Games making a comeback, but this time not quite
6915000	6917000	As old, it's the Dreamcast collection
6917000	6919000	Yay
6919000	6921000	The Dreamcast collection has been listed for the
6921000	6923000	Xbox 360 and the PS3
6923000	6925000	This was caught in a listing on GameStop
6925000	6927000	It's the Dreamcast collection
6927000	6929000	Supposed to cost $29.99
6929000	6931000	And the date that is tentative
6931000	6933000	Right now anyway for release is February 15th
6933000	6935000	You shouldn't really treat these
6935000	6937000	GameStop leaks as, you know
6937000	6939000	Word and Bond and all that because
6939000	6941000	It could change, and a lot of these are
6941000	6943000	Service holders to get people to pre-order them
6943000	6945000	But you what?
6945000	6947000	I haven't seen anything yet
6947000	6949000	Okay, here's the weird thing though
6949000	6951000	Is that Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi
6951000	6953000	Are the only announced
6953000	6955000	Dreamcast games right now
6955000	6957000	Now those games are going to cost $10
6957000	6959000	Well obviously Sonic Adventure already came out
6959000	6961000	Crazy Taxi I believe is this week
6961000	6963000	They cost only $10 a piece to download
6963000	6965000	So it would make no sense why you would drop
6965000	6967000	$30 on this game when these two games
6967000	6969000	Are $20
6969000	6971000	Some more XBLA and PSN ports
6971000	6973000	That have not yet been announced
6973000	6975000	Are coming
6975000	6977000	By the way there were a couple that had leaked
6977000	6979000	Previously including Sega Bass Fishing
6979000	6981000	And Space Channel 5
6981000	6983000	Part 2
6983000	6985000	So that could be
6985000	6987000	Where this is going is that maybe it will be
6987000	6989000	Four games in one
6989000	6991000	Although I could really do without Sega Bass Fishing
6991000	6993000	I'm sorry but I'm not really into the
6993000	6995000	Fishing games but whatever
6995000	6997000	But
6997000	6999000	Okay it was fun with the rod controller
6999000	7001000	And
7001000	7003000	But mostly because of the fact like haha
7003000	7005000	It's a rod controller now I'm over it
7005000	7007000	And then in the Japanese version it would say
7007000	7009000	FISH GET
7009000	7011000	We need the game that was formally named
7011000	7013000	Daytona
7013000	7015000	Do do do do do do
7015000	7017000	Have you seen the new one now?
7017000	7019000	They don't have the Daytona song in there
7019000	7021000	So it's like do do do do do do
7021000	7023000	Let's go
7023000	7025000	Let's go
7025000	7027000	Cheat pack
7027000	7029000	It's pretty fun
7029000	7031000	Thank you. So ladies and gentlemen in our chat room
7031000	7033000	Needs to have Power Stone 1 and 2
7033000	7035000	Thanks. Agreed with those Capcom games
7035000	7037000	Ah yes they were
7037000	7039000	So probably not gonna happen
7039000	7041000	But you can dream
7041000	7043000	Remember Power Stone collection did come out on
7043000	7045000	PSP. Oh that's right. Good call
7045000	7047000	Anyhow Dark Sakura
7047000	7049000	What do you have for us?
7049000	7051000	I have stuff and nonsense again
7051000	7053000	Actually this is pretty cool
7053000	7055000	Pinball is coming to Xbox Live
7055000	7057000	Arcade and Playstation Network
7057000	7059000	In December
7059000	7061000	Put out by Zen Studios
7061000	7063000	Um
7063000	7065000	It actually was leaked out
7065000	7067000	Because of a ratings board
7067000	7069000	Deal
7069000	7071000	But it's going to be coming out
7071000	7073000	And it will have
7073000	7075000	Different tables that are
7075000	7077000	Themed after Marvel
7077000	7079000	Superheroes like one that I'm looking at
7079000	7081000	Right now is Iron Man Pinball
7081000	7083000	I don't know
7083000	7085000	If it's actually patterned after the stern Iron Man
7085000	7087000	Pinball. I don't think so
7087000	7089000	Because that table kinda sucked
7089000	7091000	The one based off of the movie
7091000	7093000	Not for the comic
7093000	7095000	And then they said initially
7095000	7097000	Four different tables will be available
7097000	7099000	There's Blade, Spiderman, Wolverine and as I said
7099000	7101000	Iron Man
7101000	7103000	Taking a look at some of them right now
7103000	7105000	And there's also supposed to be
7105000	7107000	New download content coming
7107000	7109000	Later on
7109000	7111000	Okay the Blade one looks stupid
7111000	7113000	Iron Man one looks okay
7113000	7115000	Spiderman one looks kinda fun
7115000	7117000	Um
7117000	7119000	The Wolverine one
7119000	7121000	It's Wolverine
7121000	7123000	Oh it's alright
7123000	7125000	I don't know it could be fun
7125000	7127000	I'm kinda picky on my Pinball
7127000	7129000	I'll check it out. I think Pinball FX2 is pretty awesome
7129000	7131000	Yeah we got it
7131000	7133000	Good times
7133000	7135000	It's free. Everybody should go get it if you don't already have it
7135000	7137000	I know right
7137000	7139000	It's the same. It automatically imports all the tables
7139000	7141000	I think I talked about this last week or the week before
7141000	7143000	You did? I did
7143000	7145000	Well it's not a big surprise
7145000	7147000	Rumors that the
7147000	7149000	PSP2 prototype
7149000	7151000	They have leaked images
7151000	7153000	Of it and
7153000	7155000	It's actually been confirmed by some
7155000	7157000	Developers
7157000	7159000	Saying that the photos are legitimate
7159000	7161000	But that it's
7161000	7163000	A dev kit and that the hardware
7163000	7165000	Will probably change
7165000	7167000	The way it looks by the time the system comes out
7167000	7169000	But some of the features that were
7169000	7171000	Noticed in the pictures
7171000	7173000	It's got a front facing camera
7173000	7175000	Microphone
7175000	7177000	Finally two analog
7177000	7179000	Sticks which is awesome
7179000	7181000	Also has a back facing camera
7181000	7183000	And the rumored
7183000	7185000	Trackpad which is on the back
7185000	7187000	Of the device
7187000	7189000	That seems awfully weird to me
7189000	7191000	Unless somehow the screen like
7191000	7193000	Flips over where you can use the trackpad on the front
7193000	7195000	But um
7195000	7197000	Neat
7197000	7199000	I guess
7199000	7201000	The prototype right now looks very similar
7201000	7203000	To like the PSP Go
7203000	7205000	But they're saying that it's possible that they may
7205000	7207000	Make either
7207000	7209000	They're gonna have like two different models
7209000	7211000	One that resembles like the PSP 3000
7211000	7213000	And one the PSP Go or it's gonna be just
7213000	7215000	The PSP Go
7215000	7217000	Also it will not have a UMD drive
7217000	7219000	Instead it will be using
7219000	7221000	Some sort of memory
7221000	7223000	Sticks
7223000	7225000	Interesting so they are
7225000	7227000	Saying there's gonna be a physical media
7227000	7229000	But it's just not gonna be these discs anymore
7229000	7231000	Uh yeah
7231000	7233000	Let me be the first to say that if it's gonna be memory
7233000	7235000	Sticks that this thing's gonna be using
7235000	7237000	This will be cracked so fast
7237000	7239000	It's not even funny
7239000	7241000	Because if it's on a physical device like that
7241000	7243000	Why even bother
7243000	7245000	I know that's kind of
7245000	7247000	A scary thought on their side
7247000	7249000	But not a lot of other
7249000	7251000	Like new things about what could be on this system
7251000	7253000	Besides the whole trackpad thing
7253000	7255000	I mean you know
7255000	7257000	The new DS is going
7257000	7259000	All 3D
7259000	7261000	And stuff
7261000	7263000	Well the top screen looks like it's supposed to be
7263000	7265000	An HD screen they're saying that the
7265000	7267000	Graphics are gonna be comparable to the
7267000	7269000	Xbox 360
7269000	7271000	Oh interesting
7273000	7275000	Alright well I'm sure we'll be hearing
7275000	7277000	Plenty more about that at E3
7277000	7279000	Because it really is hard to say
7279000	7281000	That this is not at least somewhat
7281000	7283000	True at this point
7283000	7285000	Anyhow we got about 6 months to go before E3
7285000	7287000	Something that's coming out a lot sooner
7287000	7289000	If you want to get a new console is the
7289000	7291000	OnLive micro console
7291000	7293000	It is coming out December 2nd and it costs
7293000	7295000	$99 this is the whole little
7295000	7297000	Console for you to use OnLive on your
7297000	7299000	TV and yeah
7299000	7301000	When they say micro console like this thing
7301000	7303000	It's small I mean it's basically a
7303000	7305000	Miniature PC that will just do all the
7305000	7307000	Connecting to the internet and the whole cloud
7307000	7309000	Gaming thing
7309000	7311000	Strange little thing
7311000	7313000	They've already got those internet TV devices
7313000	7315000	Like at Fry's so I imagine it's the same deal
7315000	7317000	It's you know all it is is really
7317000	7319000	It just serves the
7319000	7321000	Sole function of connecting to the online
7321000	7323000	Services and using whatever technology it does to
7323000	7325000	Deliver the video just quickly
7325000	7327000	To your TV so
7327000	7329000	Kinda cool
7329000	7331000	By the way they are saying that you will only be able to get
7331000	7333000	This though on the OnLive
7333000	7335000	Website until like next year
7335000	7337000	And it's only going to be in limited quantities
7337000	7339000	So if you think you might want one of these
7339000	7341000	You gotta act like really soon
7341000	7343000	There is some other news coming out of OnLive
7343000	7345000	They are getting rid
7345000	7347000	Of the whole monthly fee that is
7347000	7349000	Going out the door
7349000	7351000	There's now going to be a flat rate pricing
7351000	7353000	Plan that will provide access to
7353000	7355000	Back catalog and indie games
7355000	7357000	Kinda similar to what you see with Netflix
7357000	7359000	And all that it's
7359000	7361000	So they're thinking maybe no more than $10
7361000	7363000	A month but there's no longer going to be a fee just to
7363000	7365000	Access the service itself which is always
7365000	7367000	Kinda a dumb idea and nobody was really
7367000	7369000	Paying for it yet anyway because it was like
7369000	7371000	Sponsored right now but yeah
7371000	7373000	That is all going out the window which is good
7373000	7375000	More information on the full
7375000	7377000	Pricing and the lineup will be coming out in December
7377000	7379000	That's according to the CEO Steve
7379000	7381000	Prolem in December we'll announce
7381000	7383000	Pricing and the lineup of games it's literally
7383000	7385000	Just a matter of getting publishers to sign
7385000	7387000	This and that and the other thing so
7387000	7389000	Very cool they eliminated the monthly
7389000	7391000	Subscription fee after they kinda pulled the
7391000	7393000	User base and looked there
7393000	7395000	And saw what users really wanted
7395000	7397000	That's cool that they're listening to that
7397000	7399000	That's smart
7399000	7401000	Also there
7401000	7403000	Could be some new platforms that come to this
7403000	7405000	As well and possibly
7405000	7407000	Exclusive games
7407000	7409000	The company is trying to get some big name
7409000	7411000	Releases as well Duke Nukem Forever
7411000	7413000	Deus Ex Human Revolution
7413000	7415000	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Red Faction Armageddon
7415000	7417000	Ghost Recon Future Soldier Fear 3
7417000	7419000	Driver and so on and so on and so on
7419000	7421000	All those types of games they're trying to get as well
7421000	7423000	What's also interesting
7423000	7425000	Is that they're looking at
7425000	7427000	iOS versions of the client
7427000	7429000	Software so on live
7429000	7431000	On your iPhone
7431000	7433000	That won't work very well I don't know how that would work
7433000	7435000	Without better controls
7435000	7437000	But I guess
7437000	7439000	You might
7439000	7441000	Might not be too far out of the realm
7441000	7443000	Of possibility I mean if Netflix and all that
7443000	7445000	Is on there somebody wants to put games on there
7445000	7447000	So I don't have to control with you
7447000	7449000	I know I get that I get that but who knows
7449000	7451000	Who knows what could happen
7451000	7453000	So there you go
7453000	7455000	By the way Apple TV they've also
7455000	7457000	Been toying with the idea of in Google TV
7457000	7459000	But they say Apple TV
7459000	7461000	May not work because it runs at 720p
7461000	7463000	And 30 frames a second you'll never get above
7463000	7465000	30 frames a second and you can't really
7465000	7467000	Get the 720p
7467000	7469000	So
7469000	7471000	Who knows
7471000	7473000	Anyhow let's move on and open up the old
7473000	7475000	Mailbag every week DarkSakura
7475000	7477000	Dives into the mailbag head first
7477000	7479000	Mailbag at
7479000	7481000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com and she pulls out some
7481000	7483000	Of her favorite emails and reads them for us
7483000	7485000	Live on air but
7485000	7487000	I don't know if there were a lot of pickins this week were there
7487000	7489000	No there weren't but I did get a reply
7489000	7491000	From the one who
7491000	7493000	Got the
7493000	7495000	Wrong name and because
7495000	7497000	They're so nice about it
7497000	7499000	He's our winner
7499000	7501000	Aww what a nice
7501000	7503000	Well Mike
7503000	7505000	Congratulations you've
7505000	7507000	Won a Castlevania Symphony of the
7507000	7509000	Night Xbox Live Arcade
7509000	7511000	Code
7511000	7513000	Enjoy
7513000	7515000	Free stuff is always good
7515000	7517000	So that's it
7517000	7519000	That was it for the emails really?
7519000	7521000	We didn't get any questions or nothing?
7521000	7523000	No
7523000	7525000	Dear OrangeLoungeRadio why is DarkSakura
7525000	7527000	So cool
7527000	7529000	I don't know listener
7529000	7531000	I think it's in her DNA
7531000	7533000	And that says such a bitch
7533000	7535000	Like I think you changed
7535000	7537000	Rob got pot hollered
7537000	7539000	At least it wasn't
7539000	7541000	Flaming hot pot holder
7541000	7543000	Well that was mailbag fail
7543000	7545000	Fail
7545000	7547000	Every one of you needs to send
7547000	7549000	An email and then we'll get Rob to read them
7549000	7551000	DarkSakura is going to have to read 50 emails next week
7551000	7553000	We'll get our special guest to read them next week
7553000	7555000	Do we have special guest next week?
7555000	7557000	You know who our special guest is?
7557000	7559000	Marissa
7559000	7561000	I am so excited
7561000	7563000	We need a pile of
7563000	7565000	emails bigger than her boobies
7565000	7567000	That's a lot of emails
7567000	7569000	That's impossible
7569000	7571000	Get starting
7571000	7573000	Marissa's rack is quite mighty
7573000	7575000	Well in the absence of emails
7575000	7593000	There's always time for FUs
7593000	7599000	Um FU to the sudden realization of my unemployment
7599000	7601000	I hated that place
7601000	7603000	A lot of the people I worked with
7603000	7605000	Actually a lot of them pissed me off too
7605000	7607000	But
7607000	7609000	It's sort of the uncertainty side of things
7609000	7611000	What am I going to do now?
7611000	7613000	I'm not having insurance
7613000	7615000	But I get to finish school
7615000	7617000	I can sleep in as much as I want to
7617000	7619000	And I'm getting my severance check
7619000	7621000	So it's not a big loss
7621000	7623000	But still kind of melancholy
7623000	7625000	You know what I mean?
7625000	7627000	It's a weird in between
7627000	7629000	place kind of be
7629000	7631000	And also um
7631000	7635000	I want frozen yogurt a lot so I feed me not having any even though I do have pumpkin ice cream
7635000	7637000	OMG I want pink berry so bad
7637000	7639000	Pink berry!
7639000	7641000	Let's go
7641000	7643000	That pumpkin pink berry right now
7643000	7645000	It's not good
7645000	7647000	It's not terrible though
7647000	7649000	But it's pumpkin
7649000	7651000	Hardly
7651000	7653000	Whatever
7653000	7655000	Loki
7655000	7659000	I guess FU to um
7659000	7661000	I don't know black asleep I guess
7661000	7663000	It's just uh
7663000	7665000	You don't have to get up early every day
7665000	7667000	It sucks
7667000	7669000	I hate waking up at 4 in the morning
7669000	7671000	And sleeping on the couch
7671000	7673000	Well
7673000	7675000	It'll only be for hopefully
7675000	7677000	A few more months
7677000	7679000	Or maybe another year or two or three
7679000	7681000	A few more years
7681000	7683000	Look forward to it
7683000	7685000	A few more years and then um
7685000	7687000	The random calling into bed and getting kicked in the head
7687000	7689000	That happens too
7689000	7691000	And then when he's like 15 or 16 he's gonna start fighting with you every day
7691000	7695000	And then your friends who don't have children have to hear about it
7695000	7699000	Or your entire internet radio audience that'll be fun
7699000	7701000	I'm also sending major hearts to Becky right now
7701000	7703000	My FU of the week
7703000	7705000	Uh goes to all the sand
7705000	7709000	That somehow lodged itself in my vagina earlier this week
7709000	7711000	Because dang there was a lot of it
7711000	7713000	No I had a really crap week
7713000	7715000	But things got better they always do
7715000	7717000	It gets better guys
7717000	7719000	It gets better
7719000	7721000	That's really it otherwise I'm just
7721000	7725000	Just looking forward to getting the week of
7725000	7727000	Lady you know
7727000	7729000	You know we're doing a show right
7729000	7731000	Yeah
7731000	7733000	But I want Dan to give an FU because Dan's FUs are amazing
7733000	7735000	Okay George can do one
7735000	7737000	An FU?
7737000	7739000	FU of the week duh
7739000	7743000	Aren't you mad at something that you want to say FU to?
7743000	7745000	Jamie loves to put people on the squad
7745000	7747000	I know I love doing it George
7747000	7751000	Which is kind of shocking because I'm normally mad at everything
7751000	7753000	What's that George? Hi George
7753000	7755000	Hello
7755000	7757000	I'm normally mad at everything but I'm not mad at anything this week
7757000	7759000	Well FU for being so happy
7759000	7761000	Damn you and your happiness
7761000	7763000	So I gave you one
7763000	7765000	That's awesome
7765000	7767000	Alright
7767000	7769000	Poor George

7821000	7823000	Portal 2 has been delayed again
7823000	7825000	Yeah man it wasn't going to come out
7825000	7827000	When they said anything
7827000	7829000	Wait wait wait wait you mean Valve delayed a game?
7829000	7831000	What?
7831000	7833000	What?
7833000	7835000	And this is news?
7835000	7837000	That's alright though it's just putting extra polish on it
7837000	7839000	It's been delayed to April 20th 2011
7839000	7841000	The day after my birthday
7841000	7843000	People you know what to do
7843000	7845000	It's the day after your birthday
7845000	7847000	You're screwed
7847000	7849000	My birthday lasts all week
7849000	7851000	It was originally planned for holiday 2010
7851000	7853000	And delayed to February 9th
7853000	7855000	2011
7855000	7857000	So now it's April
7857000	7859000	I kind of always thought it was going to be April anyways
7859000	7861000	I thought that's what it was
7861000	7863000	I didn't realize it was actually February
7863000	7865000	It was the release date for that but yeah whatever
7865000	7867000	It's April now so get over it
7869000	7871000	Alright just in time for Jamie's birthday
7871000	7873000	What about my birthday?
7873000	7875000	What are you going to get me for my birthday Valve?
7875000	7877000	I'll give you a dollar
7877000	7879000	You're not Valve
7879000	7881000	I'll give you a Valve
7881000	7883000	I'm sure we got a couple
7883000	7885000	Alright file this last story
7885000	7887000	Of our night under what
7887000	7889000	And huh
7889000	7891000	Yeah this is a
7891000	7893000	Comment from Bobby Kotick I don't know why
7893000	7895000	Whatever this guy says makes news but I don't know
7895000	7897000	You love to hate him or you hate to love him
7897000	7899000	I don't know very interesting comic
7899000	7901000	Though a comic
7901000	7903000	Freudian slip maybe I don't know
7903000	7905000	Very interesting comment from Mr. Kotick
7905000	7907000	Though it's about the online pass
7907000	7909000	Thing you know EA, THQ
7909000	7911000	$10 online play if you buy
7911000	7913000	The game used
7913000	7915000	Quote from Bobby Kotick
7915000	7917000	We can do some of these things
7917000	7919000	EA's and others have done
7919000	7921000	We actually don't think it's in the best interest
7921000	7923000	Of the gamer and so we've chosen not to
7923000	7925000	From a financial
7925000	7927000	Perspective you look at it and say
7927000	7929000	Okay well the retailer is not paying us
7929000	7931000	Anything for the privilege of doing it and you know
7931000	7933000	We invest all this capital in making a game
7933000	7935000	We're not getting any credit any return on their
7935000	7937000	Resale of the game but you know something
7937000	7939000	The best way to keep people engaged in your game
7939000	7941000	Experience is to keep giving them
7941000	7943000	More great content
7943000	7945000	I think you always need to be sensitive to that
7945000	7947000	Relationship and not crossing the line to a
7947000	7949000	Place where the customer feels like they
7949000	7951000	Have been taken advantage of
7951000	7953000	So that's why
7953000	7955000	They would rather put out $15
7955000	7957000	Map packs for their games
7957000	7959000	Than an online pass
7959000	7961000	You know what though
7961000	7963000	I'm actually kind of okay
7963000	7965000	With that
7965000	7967000	I mean
7967000	7969000	It would be better if it was cheaper but at least
7969000	7971000	It's like more content
7971000	7973000	But the only thing, here's what I don't like
7973000	7975000	Is that when that additional content
7975000	7977000	Is um
7977000	7979000	Stuff that like is
7979000	7981000	Necessary to the game and what I
7981000	7983000	Really hate is when that content is already
7983000	7985000	On the disc because that is not
7985000	7987000	Downloadable content, oh man I haven't gone on
7987000	7989000	Download to unlock, I haven't gone on this rant
7989000	7991000	In years, that is not downloadable
7991000	7993000	Content that is pay to unlock
7993000	7995000	Content and that's what we should be referring
7995000	7997000	To it as, when you're
7997000	7999000	Paying to unlock content on our young disc
7999000	8001000	Like beautiful
8001000	8003000	Katamari on the 360, had plenty of pay
8003000	8005000	To unlock content
8005000	8007000	There it is
8007000	8009000	Alright that's gonna do it for our
8009000	8011000	News stories tonight
8011000	8013000	We're gonna open up the Skype line now, I should probably take us
8013000	8015000	Off Do Not Disturb in order to do that
8015000	8017000	Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype
8017000	8019000	Or you can give us a call on the old telefono
8019000	8021000	877-GAME-OLR
8021000	8023000	Is our name on
8023000	8025000	I'm sorry 877-GAME-OLR
8025000	8027000	Is our phone number
8027000	8029000	And you can give that a call
8029000	8031000	In the meantime
8031000	8033000	I don't know if Loki has any
8033000	8035000	Last minute stories tonight but
8037000	8039000	You have anything last minute for us Loki?
8039000	8041000	Uh
8041000	8043000	Yeah apparently there's gonna be
8043000	8045000	A new cheat tool coming to the
8045000	8047000	PlayStation 3 from Code Freak
8047000	8049000	Um
8049000	8051000	Apparently the people
8051000	8053000	Behind the Code Freak
8053000	8055000	Um tool
8055000	8057000	CyberGadget have announced a new device coming
8057000	8059000	To the PS3 in Japan
8059000	8061000	Um it's a
8061000	8063000	Walkthrough tool as they call it
8063000	8065000	And it's gonna cost 7800 yen
8065000	8067000	And it'll come with cheats for 50 titles
8067000	8069000	And they say
8069000	8071000	More codes can be downloaded via
8071000	8073000	PC
8073000	8075000	So I don't know
8075000	8079000	It sounds like modified saves almost
8079000	8081000	Shall we go to the phones?
8081000	8083000	Yes let's
8083000	8085000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
8085000	8086000	Hey this is X-Link
8086000	8087000	Hi X-Link
8087000	8089000	I just had to beat out Rama for one week
8089000	8091000	That's alright long time listener first time caller right?
8091000	8093000	As always
8093000	8094000	What's on your mind?
8094000	8096000	I have a question for you
8096000	8098000	How the hell can you dog Age of Empire 3
8098000	8100000	But yet you will play Civilization
8100000	8102000	Because I'm a hypocrite
8102000	8107000	I'm just kind of curious
8107000	8109000	I was like wait a minute you're sitting there saying
8109000	8112000	Age of Empire is not worth the 10 cents
8112000	8114000	But yet you would play
8114000	8116000	Powers on end Civilization 5
8116000	8118000	Because I have a very simple answer for you
8118000	8120000	It's just gonna blow your mind
8120000	8122000	My simple answer for all of this X-Link
8122000	8124000	It's amazing I can't solve world peace
8124000	8126000	You ready?
8126000	8128000	The reason why I don't want to pay 10 cents
8128000	8130000	For Age of Empires 3 is because
8130000	8132000	I have Civilization 5
8132000	8134000	I don't need anything else
8134000	8136000	Well that's true I kind of agree with you
8136000	8138000	Unfortunately I don't have Civilization 5
8138000	8140000	So I have to go with the next best thing for right now
8140000	8142000	But yes
8142000	8144000	In all seriousness
8144000	8146000	You know what 10 cents for a game is obviously a steal
8146000	8148000	But I'm just more making fun of the fact that like
8148000	8150000	The entirety of the internet is freaking out about like
8150000	8152000	OMG game for 10 cents
8152000	8154000	But it's kind of like well yeah
8154000	8157000	The game's 5 years old and who would give a shit about this anyway
8157000	8159000	It's like most of the Steam sales
8159000	8161000	You rarely see current games
8161000	8163000	Going on sale on Steam
8163000	8165000	Although to be fair
8165000	8167000	Steam does manage to get some of those really good deals
8167000	8169000	Like you know when they were putting Torchlight on sale
8169000	8171000	For like half its price
8171000	8173000	They've done some deals with Poker Night which isn't even out yet
8173000	8175000	So you know
8175000	8177000	Which I'm looking forward to that
8177000	8179000	Because that supposedly is going to be coming out Tuesday
8179000	8181000	So I'm definitely looking forward to that
8181000	8183000	I think it's actually tomorrow
8183000	8185000	Is it tomorrow? I think so
8185000	8187000	Maybe it's tomorrow
8187000	8189000	Jeremy Todd one in our chatroom says
8189000	8191000	But it's only 10 cents
8191000	8195000	I bought it 6 different times just so I can have more AOE 3 than you
8195000	8199000	Now that's showing your support
8199000	8201000	Wow
8201000	8203000	Yeah but yeah
8203000	8205000	You know again
8205000	8207000	Competition never a bad thing
8207000	8209000	I'm really excited for Black Friday
8209000	8211000	OMG we're going to get some steal games
8211000	8213000	But that's a really good deal though
8213000	8215000	10 cents you can't really
8215000	8217000	Don't really want to pass that up
8217000	8219000	For even a game I mean even if you don't get a gift
8219000	8221000	For somebody else you know 10 cents
8221000	8223000	We'll see we'll see
8223000	8227000	It sounds like almost like we're doing one of those info commercials for those children
8227000	8229000	I know right
8229000	8231000	It's just the price of a cup of coffee a day
8231000	8233000	Precisely
8233000	8235000	But you know I saw that I was amazed by that
8235000	8237000	I'm like a $40 game 10 cents
8237000	8240000	Well it was $40 back in 2005
8240000	8243000	But I guarantee you that game is in like $3 bargain bins
8243000	8245000	At Best Buys everywhere
8245000	8248000	Probably but according to their website it was still at $40
8248000	8250000	Well of course because it's a Microsoft game
8250000	8252000	They don't want to admit that it's you know
8252000	8254000	Yes they officially haven't dropped the price of it
8254000	8258000	Does not mean everybody else hasn't to try to clear out inventory
8258000	8260000	That's right
8260000	8262000	Speaking of Microsoft and things like that
8262000	8264000	I'm actually looking forward to this whole Dungeon Siege 3
8264000	8267000	Even though technically it's what Squeenix is doing it now
8267000	8269000	Microsoft has done the first couple games
8269000	8271000	I'm looking forward to that
8271000	8273000	Those should be very interesting
8273000	8277000	Hopefully they don't bastardize it like Final Fantasy XIV
8277000	8280000	Well it's not like an online MMO type of thing
8280000	8282000	And don't feel too bad
8282000	8284000	I was right with you with the whole raid thing
8284000	8286000	Remember because unfortunately my account
8286000	8288000	I was stupid and let it lapse
8288000	8290000	So I wasn't there during that whole time
8290000	8292000	Yeah we're not able to take phone calls during Horde House
8292000	8294000	So I know you couldn't really chime in on this
8294000	8296000	But yeah I know we both missed it
8296000	8298000	At least you don't have to feel all alone
8298000	8300000	Like I'm the only one who didn't get it
8300000	8302000	No I'm right there with you
8302000	8304000	All in due time my friend
8304000	8306000	Yeah I know we'll get it eventually
8306000	8308000	We just might be level 81 or 82
8308000	8311000	But hey it'll work out
8311000	8313000	We'll be geared for it
8313000	8315000	Cataclysm happening soon
8315000	8317000	The rumor on the street is that the world is coming to an end
8317000	8319000	On Tuesday in World of Warcraft
8319000	8322000	It's the end of the world as we know it
8322000	8324000	But I feel fine
8324000	8326000	They're doing a lot of odds and ends and disconnects
8326000	8328000	Going to be more Gloriant than ever
8328000	8330000	So yes
8330000	8332000	We all look forward to that
8332000	8334000	Now you started playing WoW with Wrath of the Lich King right?
8334000	8336000	So are you looking forward to your first
8336000	8338000	Proper expansion rolling out?
8338000	8340000	No because I don't have the money for it
8340000	8342000	Aww
8342000	8344000	Well you know what the good news is though
8344000	8346000	You won't be competing with everyone else
8346000	8348000	Trying to level in those zones and everything
8348000	8350000	Because it's going to be a shit show
8350000	8352000	I was going to do that anyways to be quite honest
8352000	8354000	My first goal when that was going to come out
8354000	8356000	Was going to be the archeology
8356000	8358000	To get that to 450
8358000	8360000	Gotcha
8360000	8362000	Well anyway the other hosts are going to start
8362000	8364000	Glaring at me if I fill up the show with the Warcraft chat
8364000	8366000	Nope
8366000	8368000	My eyes glosed over and my brain went foggy
8368000	8370000	Exactly
8370000	8372000	That's why they made me take it to a separate show
8372000	8374000	Have a good one
8374000	8376000	Thanks for calling
8376000	8378000	Bye

8396000	8398000	Long time listener first time caller right
8398000	8400000	Hi
8400000	8402000	What's on your mind buddy
8402000	8404000	Hey um
8404000	8406000	Now this is something I wanted to talk about
8406000	8408000	Unfortunately I wasn't able to last week but
8408000	8410000	This is the whole
8410000	8412000	Music game genre with
8412000	8414000	Rock band and guitar hero
8414000	8416000	Now let me ask you
8416000	8418000	Guys do you see it
8418000	8420000	Like really dying
8420000	8422000	Dead like DDR or
8422000	8424000	Something else
8424000	8426000	DDR hasn't exactly fallen
8426000	8428000	Over dead though like I get what you're saying
8428000	8430000	DDR is not what it was to
8430000	8432000	You and me ten years ago
8432000	8434000	But they did just release a game
8434000	8436000	Two weeks ago so I don't see any
8436000	8438000	Reason why they won't continue to release
8438000	8440000	Rock band style plastic guitar and drum
8440000	8442000	Games ten years from now
8442000	8444000	But it's not going to be what it was
8444000	8446000	In it's hey day when rock band and all
8446000	8448000	This stuff first came out
8448000	8450000	Okay cause the way I see it is this
8450000	8452000	Konami throws us DDR
8452000	8454000	Yay here's another one
8454000	8456000	Yay here's another one
8456000	8458000	Wait wait what is this
8458000	8460000	Yeah Konami we got to talk what is
8460000	8462000	This drop
8462000	8464000	Or as with rock band and guitar hero
8464000	8466000	Here you go yay
8466000	8468000	Here you go plus we threw her some
8468000	8470000	More stuff sweet
8470000	8472000	Here's another game this time
8472000	8474000	We'll give you more stuff sweet
8474000	8476000	That's the way I see it
8476000	8478000	And having an interesting
8478000	8480000	Discussion with a couple of people on Twitter about this
8480000	8482000	Who think that the whole
8482000	8484000	Gaming rhythm gaming is falling
8484000	8486000	Apart due to lack of sales
8486000	8488000	I honestly believe lack of sales
8488000	8490000	Come from the fact of it's too
8490000	8492000	Damn expensive because of the pricing
8492000	8494000	Of the bundles and all the other accessories
8494000	8496000	More or less right about now in this economy
8496000	8498000	Who has 180 bucks
8498000	8500000	And what I would tell your friends on
8500000	8502000	Twitter is again the sales
8502000	8504000	Of Dance Central sort of
8504000	8506000	Kind of counters that argument that music games
8506000	8508000	Are just dead in the water
8508000	8510000	Music games are just evolving
8510000	8512000	Plastic guitar and plastic drum games
8512000	8514000	Are on their way out
8514000	8516000	That is what these studies are showing
8516000	8518000	What has the music genre been focused on for the past few years
8518000	8520000	What has the media been focused on for the past few years
8520000	8522000	It's all about these plastic guitar games
8522000	8524000	Alright their time is coming to an end
8524000	8526000	Let's bring on the next big thing in music gaming
8526000	8528000	It's out there somewhere
8528000	8530000	Which is why I don't blame
8530000	8532000	EA for not bundling
8532000	8534000	Rock band 3
8534000	8536000	With a pro guitar
8536000	8538000	Or even a regular guitar
8538000	8540000	My roommate went to go buy the game like last Sunday
8540000	8542000	He comes back and he's like I didn't buy the game
8542000	8544000	It's because all the instruments are not made by EA anymore
8544000	8546000	So that's why they're not doing any of the bundles
8546000	8548000	Even the bundles with the keyboard were actually
8548000	8550000	Being published by Mad Cats
8550000	8552000	And they opted out on doing
8552000	8554000	Bundles with all that stuff because they need to have
8554000	8556000	80,000 bundles in the stores
8556000	8558000	And it would confuse people
8558000	8560000	Most retailers though are kind of smart
8560000	8562000	And they put the plastic guitars
8562000	8564000	Right next to the game, you know what I mean?
8564000	8566000	Exactly, and I explained that to him
8566000	8568000	But he still, it took me like 3 days
8568000	8570000	To explain to him, they're not bundling it
8570000	8572000	Because it's a different company making the accessories
8572000	8574000	If you want the pro guitar that badly
8574000	8576000	Just be like everybody else
8576000	8578000	Pre-order, go down there
8578000	8580000	And whoop somebody's ass to get one
8580000	8582000	Interesting, I wonder if
8582000	8584000	Just all this saturation is partially to blame
8584000	8586000	Well, as we went into a couple weeks ago
8586000	8588000	On the show, it kind of is
8588000	8590000	I think Guitar Hero
8590000	8592000	In some ways is to blame for rock bands
8592000	8594000	Tumble
8594000	8596000	But I don't know, you know what?
8596000	8598000	We still have All Christmas to get through
8598000	8600000	I think they'll still sell more copies of Rock Band 3
8600000	8602000	I tend to think so too
8602000	8604000	And you know
8604000	8606000	Not for nothing, I did pick up Rock Band
8606000	8608000	The Beatles' Rock Band, but I can understand why
8608000	8610000	The game didn't do so well
8610000	8612000	And the same thing with Green Day Rock Band
8612000	8614000	Because it's simple
8614000	8616000	Most of today's, to this generation
8616000	8618000	Probably had never heard of the Beatles
8618000	8620000	I guarantee you
8620000	8622000	I guess it's just me being biased
8622000	8624000	But if it was Rock Band, Bon Jovi
8624000	8626000	I think we would have done at least 2-3 times
8626000	8628000	Normal sales
8628000	8630000	Because everybody's heard of Bon Jovi
8630000	8632000	Hate me if you want
8632000	8634000	That's not really a game I'd be interested in
8634000	8636000	That's the problem with these games
8636000	8638000	No matter what, no matter who the band is
8638000	8640000	That they pick, because I'll sit here and go
8640000	8642000	But give me Rock Band Journey and oh my god
8642000	8644000	You know, but I realize it's still not going to sell
8644000	8646000	Any better, you know, I think
8646000	8648000	You take the Beatles
8648000	8650000	They are the biggest selling band of all time
8650000	8652000	Whether they are anymore or whatever
8652000	8654000	It's just one of those, you know what?
8654000	8656000	A game so focused on one band
8656000	8658000	Is never going to appeal to a mass market
8658000	8660000	But Rob, if they gave you the choice
8660000	8662000	If they said, okay, hey, we're going to release
8662000	8664000	Rock Band Journey as a standalone game
8664000	8666000	Or you can download all the songs
8666000	8668000	You probably download all the songs
8670000	8672000	I would like it better if I could download all the songs
8672000	8676000	And like a Journey themed background or something
8676000	8678000	Fair enough
8678000	8680000	You know what I mean? Like something to kind of add into the Rock Band experience
8680000	8682000	Which I'm kind of surprised they haven't done
8682000	8684000	Like, you know, you have all these track packs
8684000	8686000	Or whatever, why not have like a
8686000	8688000	You know, no doubt themed arena
8688000	8690000	To go with the CD or something like that, you know?
8690000	8692000	I'm glad you asked that question, and the reason why
8692000	8694000	Is because they have each song
8694000	8696000	They have programmed in
8696000	8698000	Different camera cuts and stuff
8698000	8700000	Depending on which stage they're in
8700000	8702000	And if they add another stage, they go back and edit
8702000	8704000	Every single song to add that stage into it
8704000	8706000	Interesting
8706000	8708000	I always thought it was just more generic than that
8708000	8710000	Like, you know, cut here, cut here, or whatever
8710000	8712000	No. Interesting
8712000	8714000	Rob, you're right about that
8714000	8716000	You wouldn't buy the game, but
8716000	8718000	What I see is this
8718000	8720000	If it was out of like ten people
8720000	8722000	Maybe eight people would buy
8722000	8724000	The Bon Jovi game compared to maybe like
8724000	8726000	Six would buy the Journey themed game
8726000	8728000	You see what I'm saying?
8728000	8730000	Go with a band that more people would probably buy
8730000	8732000	Because it's a given
8732000	8734000	100% is not going to buy
8734000	8736000	A band themed game
8736000	8738000	Because not everybody is behind them, you know?
8738000	8740000	Here's the thing though
8740000	8742000	I think there are very, very, very few
8742000	8744000	And I know I've gotten into this on the show before
8744000	8746000	So you've probably heard this feel before
8746000	8748000	There are very, very few bands
8748000	8750000	And artists that
8750000	8752000	Can justify an entire release
8752000	8754000	For their brand
8754000	8756000	And the Beatles were
8756000	8758000	Certainly one of them
8758000	8760000	Michael Jackson is another
8760000	8762000	And there's probably nobody else
8762000	8764000	In that top tier, to be honest
8764000	8766000	I don't think there is any other band or musical
8766000	8768000	Act that fits into that same caliber
8768000	8770000	As Michael Jackson and the Beatles. None
8770000	8772000	Now you go down to the next tier
8772000	8774000	And that's where you get your
8774000	8776000	Bon Jovis and your
8776000	8778000	Van Halen's and your
8778000	8780000	Aerosmith and Metallica
8780000	8782000	But I don't even think
8782000	8784000	Green Day fits into that tier
8784000	8786000	Honestly, I was too fond of
8786000	8788000	Green Day being in that tier
8788000	8790000	In that tier above. I don't even think
8790000	8792000	Aerosmith was more deserving than Metallica
8792000	8794000	If you'll ask me, but that's just my opinion
8794000	8796000	Right, and then it just
8796000	8798000	Starts to get into opinions
8798000	8800000	But you just have to look at history, record sales
8800000	8802000	How many t-shirts of the band's name have been sold
8802000	8804000	I think Metallica
8804000	8806000	And Aerosmith are about even, it's just different
8806000	8808000	Crowds. Pretty much
8808000	8810000	So, but I think
8810000	8812000	That very very top tier
8812000	8814000	There's nobody in it but the Beatles and Michael Jackson
8814000	8816000	Nobody has that same kind of
8816000	8818000	Pull. And now we see
8818000	8820000	What we're getting, I mean Michael Jackson
8820000	8822000	Just never really worked right for a rock band
8822000	8824000	Kind of set up, so now we see
8824000	8826000	What we're getting instead, which I don't know if
8826000	8828000	It's the best idea, but I won't see
8828000	8830000	For real until I get to play the game
8830000	8832000	I'm interested, I gotta say
8832000	8834000	I find the idea of a Michael Jackson
8834000	8836000	Dance-y type just dance game
8836000	8838000	More appealing than some of the other dance
8838000	8840000	Games I've seen
8840000	8842000	Well, I mean, I've seen people
8842000	8844000	Play, I think it's pretty fun. Me personally, if I'm gonna
8844000	8846000	Sit there and play it, I'm gonna get the official
8846000	8848000	Loafers and the glove and the jacket
8848000	8850000	And just rock out with my cock out, you know
8850000	8852000	Hey, hold on there, Michael Jackson got in trouble
8852000	8854000	For that. Alright. Yeah, but I'm an
8854000	8856000	Adult, so it's okay. Alright
8856000	8858000	Alright, we gotta let you go buddy
8858000	8860000	But I appreciate the discussion, it was good
8860000	8862000	Come on buddy. You too, later
8862000	8864000	Later
8864000	8866000	1877 game OLR, username on
8866000	8868000	Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio
8868000	8870000	GioVidea says, I want Billy Joel for rock band
8870000	8872000	Hey, good news GioVidea, they're gonna do like
8872000	8874000	This huge Billy Joel track pack
8874000	8876000	Keyboards and all
8876000	8878000	I believe December-ish
8878000	8880000	Early December-ish
8880000	8882000	Is when it's coming, and I'm talking like
8882000	8884000	It's like ten songs, so
8884000	8886000	That should be very exciting, correct?
8886000	8888000	I don't know
8888000	8890000	Should we go to more calls, or
8890000	8892000	Last minute stories, or what are we gonna do here?
8892000	8894000	1877 game OLR, username on
8894000	8896000	Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio
8896000	8898000	You wanna throw out a last minute story real quick, Logan?
8898000	8900000	Yeah, sure, let's do that
8900000	8902000	Okay, I'm trying to think
8902000	8904000	Oh, this is kinda cool
8904000	8906000	I saw this actually
8906000	8908000	You know that game, Super Mario crossover
8908000	8910000	Well of course they're doing another update
8910000	8912000	For it, and they're adding the blaster master
8912000	8914000	Vehicle as
8914000	8916000	One of the characters you can play as
8916000	8918000	Yeah, I saw that on the Twitter, somebody tweeted that
8918000	8920000	To us this week, I saw that, that's cool
8920000	8922000	Yes, very very cool, so
8922000	8924000	That update is not yet live
8924000	8926000	But it will be coming soon though
8926000	8928000	I actually played a little bit of that game before
8928000	8930000	The show with the last update
8930000	8932000	Ryu from Ninja Gaiden
8932000	8934000	So
8934000	8936000	Very cool
8936000	8938000	Alright, hold on, our phones are lighting up like all at once now
8938000	8940000	Let me go take some calls, hi you're on OrangeLawnsRadio
8940000	8942000	Who's this?
8942000	8944000	Hi, this is Pazinator
8944000	8946000	Hi everybody
8946000	8948000	Yeah, a couple of things that I
8948000	8950000	Didn't get around to tweeting to you
8950000	8952000	For
8952000	8954000	They're all kinda interrelated
8954000	8956000	First off
8956000	8958000	Right off the top of my list
8958000	8960000	For those of us
8960000	8962000	That have access to a PlayStation 3
8962000	8964000	And the PlayStation Network
8964000	8966000	There's another
8966000	8968000	Free anime
8968000	8970000	Episode currently on the store
8970000	8972000	It's called
8972000	8974000	Saigon the Complete Series Episode 1
8974000	8976000	The 60 Billion
8976000	8978000	Double Dollar Man
8978000	8980000	Hey, let me ask you this
8980000	8982000	How do you keep tabs on
8982000	8984000	All this free stuff that's coming out
8984000	8986000	Is this you just checking the store kinda every Wednesday
8986000	8988000	When they do the updates, or is there like a blog
8988000	8990000	That kinda tracks all the free shit on
8990000	8992000	PSN
8992000	8994000	There's no blog that I'm aware of
8994000	8996000	That tracks all the free stuff
8996000	8998000	It's just that
8998000	9000000	I was like self-censoring, did you hear that?
9000000	9002000	Yeah
9002000	9004000	I just hate to say it
9004000	9006000	But I got no life
9006000	9008000	And I'm constantly
9008000	9010000	Checking things on the store
9010000	9012000	You know what, it's okay
9012000	9014000	When Game Room was still new and fresh
9014000	9016000	And the games were really notable
9016000	9018000	Every Wednesday, I would plop on the couch
9018000	9020000	And run over and see what came out
9020000	9022000	And Virtual Console, it was new too
9022000	9024000	No worries, dude
9024000	9026000	Yeah, I really won't
9026000	9028000	Get into my opinion of
9028000	9030000	The free show cause
9030000	9032000	Why I think of the show may differ from
9032000	9034000	What you or Jeannie or Loki
9034000	9036000	Would think of the show
9036000	9038000	My own opinion
9038000	9040000	Would probably be irrelevant
9040000	9042000	Sum it up into one sentence
9042000	9044000	Basically
9044000	9046000	It's a free show
9046000	9048000	Even if you download it
9048000	9050000	And hate the show
9050000	9052000	It's free
9052000	9054000	That was a perfect sentence, Spaznator
9054000	9056000	It's a free show
9056000	9058000	Perfect, perfect
9058000	9060000	Alright
9060000	9062000	On a relaying note, for those of us
9062000	9064000	In our age group
9064000	9066000	That grew up with it
9066000	9068000	They just
9068000	9070000	Start putting, of all things
9070000	9072000	He-Man and Masters of the Universe
9072000	9074000	On the PlayStation Network
9074000	9076000	Dude, really? Is She-Ra up yet?
9076000	9078000	Not yet
9078000	9080000	But at this rate, I'm wondering if it
9080000	9082000	Goes up there soon
9082000	9084000	They don't have all the episodes
9084000	9086000	Up yet, just 33
9086000	9088000	But damn, damn it all
9088000	9090000	I, I grew up
9090000	9092000	You know, watching that show
9092000	9094000	Religiously, I mean, you know
9094000	9096000	Dad and Voltron and Transformers
9096000	9098000	I mean, you know, I practically
9098000	9100000	Had a orgasm once I realized
9100000	9102000	They went up on the store and
9102000	9104000	Granted, you know, the first
9104000	9106000	One on the store was, you know, they had
9106000	9108000	A fail at the same time, 99 cents
9108000	9110000	Each, you know, I grabbed
9110000	9112000	What I could afford and
9112000	9114000	I was blessed, sorry
9114000	9116000	Only two episodes
9116000	9118000	But as soon as I came
9118000	9120000	I'm gonna snatch up the rest
9120000	9122000	And, you know, if only
9122000	9124000	They put up like Gia, Joe
9124000	9126000	And the rest of the
9126000	9128000	Episodes of Transformers
9128000	9130000	You know, season two and onward
9130000	9132000	You know, I'd be a
9132000	9134000	Happy camper, you know?
9134000	9136000	Hey, Gia Videa is saving the day for me and pointing out
9136000	9138000	That She-Ra is at least on Netflix
9138000	9140000	So you can get it on your PS3
9140000	9142000	You know, when they switch to digital
9142000	9144000	TV and stuff right here and we started getting all those weird
9144000	9146000	.2 channels
9146000	9148000	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
9148000	9150000	There is actually a channel, I don't remember what it's called now
9150000	9152000	But in the Sacramento area that plays
9152000	9154000	Old cartoons like that
9154000	9156000	They even play the original Ghostbusters cartoon
9156000	9158000	Not the 80s cartoon
9158000	9160000	But the one that actually predated the movies
9160000	9162000	You know, like from the 70s
9162000	9164000	Uh, what, who's station
9164000	9166000	Is that Fox's number two?
9166000	9168000	I don't remember
9168000	9170000	It's not the more or
9170000	9172000	It, it
9172000	9174000	My friend actually watches
9174000	9176000	A lot of that stuff
9176000	9178000	Voltron and stuff
9178000	9180000	One of them, the Fox affiliate here had a
9180000	9182000	Second channel that was nothing
9182000	9184000	But music videos
9184000	9186000	It was like what MTV should have been
9186000	9188000	But that went away, it only lasted like four years
9188000	9190000	If you haven't checked it out
9190000	9192000	Because not all cable companies pick them up
9192000	9194000	Get your HDTV to search for signals in the area
9194000	9196000	Because that's kind of part of the cool thing about HDTV
9196000	9198000	Now your NBC station
9198000	9200000	Only ever had one channel
9200000	9202000	But now they have like three or four
9202000	9204000	Some of them
9204000	9206000	And some of them are weird, like we have this one, it's like
9206000	9208000	More TV Sacramento where they play these random movies
9208000	9210000	Like these strangest movies out there
9210000	9212000	Some of them are gonna be like Gospel
9212000	9214000	And some of them are nothing but the Weather Channel
9214000	9216000	But local, but there's some
9216000	9218000	You'll find some weird shit out there
9218000	9220000	Sorry
9220000	9222000	Yeah, yeah, yeah
9222000	9224000	I can't really knock
9224000	9226000	Because I never used it
9226000	9228000	So I can't really say anything positive or negative
9228000	9230000	About it until I use it
9230000	9232000	You know
9232000	9234000	The thing is with me
9234000	9236000	In order to use it I would have to get a credit card
9236000	9238000	I don't have one currently
9238000	9240000	So I'm basically stuck
9240000	9242000	Buying things off of
9242000	9244000	Either Xbox Live
9244000	9246000	Zoom Marketplace
9246000	9248000	Or TSN
9248000	9250000	And in a way
9250000	9252000	It kind of works out
9252000	9254000	In a way
9254000	9256000	It may be
9256000	9258000	Kind of expensive
9258000	9260000	Depending on how you look at
9260000	9262000	Compared to other
9262000	9264000	Ways of getting stuff
9264000	9266000	But at the same time
9266000	9268000	It's also cheaper
9268000	9270000	At least in the sense that
9270000	9272000	You can buy the stuff piecemeal
9272000	9274000	Low over time
9274000	9276000	Over an extended period of time
9276000	9278000	And not only that
9278000	9280000	But at least
9280000	9282000	Compared to getting
9282000	9284000	Stuff on BluRay
9284000	9286000	Or DVD or whatever
9286000	9288000	Where you're basically stuck
9288000	9290000	Every episode of
9290000	9292000	One particular season
9292000	9294000	Where you really only want
9294000	9296000	Let's say an episode of
9296000	9298000	Five of whatever series
9298000	9300000	Well it's nice if nothing else
9300000	9302000	At least there's different options
9302000	9304000	Out there
9304000	9306000	Yeah
9306000	9308000	Granted
9308000	9310000	TSN's not perfect
9310000	9312000	I've been on board
9312000	9314000	On the show multiple times complaining
9314000	9316000	About here and there
9316000	9318000	But at least
9318000	9320000	It's out there
9320000	9322000	It's something you can do at least
9322000	9324000	Alright Spaznator we're going to let you go so we wrap up
9324000	9326000	The show but thanks so much for your call
9326000	9328000	Really appreciate it
9328000	9330000	Have a good one buddy
9330000	9332000	Alright that's going to do it for the skype line tonight
9332000	9334000	Sorry to those that didn't get through
9334000	9336000	And if you're sitting there going why is it always the same people
9336000	9338000	Every week to get through on skype
9338000	9340000	Because you're not calling us
9340000	9342000	So if you're mad at hearing the same people
9342000	9344000	Every week you've got to give us a call
9344000	9346000	1-877-GAME-OL-R or remember there are
9346000	9348000	Other ways you can interact with the show
9348000	9350000	If you're like shy and you're like I don't want any people
9350000	9352000	To hear my voice hehe
9352000	9354000	Or you don't want your parents knowing that you're calling that's fine
9354000	9356000	Give us an email mailbag at orange lounge radio
9356000	9358000	Dot com we don't want you to get in trouble
9358000	9360000	You can also send us tweets
9360000	9362000	This is the show where every gamer has a voice
9362000	9364000	We want to make sure you are heard
9364000	9366000	Anyhow any more last minute stories
9366000	9368000	We want to get to tonight Loki before we wrap things up
9368000	9370000	Yeah one
9370000	9372000	One other thing here
9372000	9374000	Halo Wars they're turning off the servers
9374000	9376000	December 15th I heard about that
9376000	9378000	So that sucks and the game's not that old
9378000	9380000	Either and
9380000	9382000	Apparently yeah
9382000	9384000	Barely two years old Microsoft
9384000	9386000	Is pulling the plug on Halo Wars
9386000	9388000	Getting rid of the leaderboard and stat
9388000	9390000	Tracking as well as the forums
9390000	9392000	They're just
9392000	9394000	Throwing it all away aren't they
9394000	9396000	They are forums that expensive to maintain
9396000	9398000	Really
9398000	9400000	It says community was informed that on Tuesday
9400000	9402000	They were also told that they were transitioning
9402000	9404000	To the Halo Waypoint forums
9404000	9406000	Which is a nice way of saying
9406000	9408000	That halowars.com
9408000	9410000	Is going away
9410000	9412000	So it says
9412000	9414000	More importantly the forums will disappear
9414000	9416000	And so will online stat tracking
9416000	9418000	And it says
9418000	9420000	I know this will be rough on a lot of you guys
9420000	9422000	This is from one of the forum mods
9422000	9424000	And here's some of the comments
9424000	9426000	Game is dead. Fuck you. No stat tracking
9426000	9428000	You just killed this game. Fuck you
9428000	9430000	They are cheap bastards
9430000	9432000	I'm buying this domain when they let it go lol
9432000	9434000	And it says possibly the most
9434000	9436000	Close knit video game
9436000	9438000	Forum community is going to be tossed
9438000	9440000	With a bunch of reach junkies
9440000	9442000	Doh
9442000	9444000	So sad
9444000	9446000	So TigerClaw sent me this link he wanted me to play
9446000	9448000	For you Loki
9448000	9450000	You might recognize this
9460000	9462000	Wow this is old
9464000	9466000	I was thinking about the ghostbusters
9466000	9468000	And the real ghostbusters but I didn't even
9468000	9470000	Know there was this really old one
9470000	9472000	We used to watch this all the time
9472000	9474000	My little brothers loved it
9474000	9476000	And when we were really really little
9476000	9478000	We had this
9478000	9480000	It was a garage that had been converted to a
9480000	9482000	Playroom and they'd take
9482000	9484000	This big chair and put a driving wheel in front
9484000	9486000	Of it and try to beat the car
9486000	9488000	Nice
9488000	9490000	JeremyTaw1 in our chat room is kind of pissed about
9490000	9492000	This story that Loki just reported on
9492000	9494000	I'm sorry but this whole server pulling thing
9494000	9496000	Is bullshit. Someone pays 60 bucks
9496000	9498000	For a game should be able to play it online
9498000	9500000	For at least a few years without them
9500000	9502000	Turning it off. Now here's the thing though
9502000	9504000	I don't think it says that they're taking down the online
9504000	9506000	They're taking down the leaderboards and stat tracking
9506000	9508000	All the frills that come on the website
9508000	9510000	I still think you can play online
9510000	9512000	Because it's Microsoft's live servers
9512000	9514000	I can't imagine they'd take those down
9514000	9516000	What else do you pay for gold for?
9516000	9518000	The other quick thing I wanted to throw out here
9518000	9520000	That Tigerclaw had sent us
9520000	9522000	Was about the video game awards on
9522000	9524000	Spike TV. I guess the nominees have been announced
9524000	9526000	But I'm kind of like
9526000	9528000	Are these really relevant?
9528000	9530000	The only reason why the video game awards
9530000	9532000	Are really relevant at all
9532000	9534000	Is that they show commercials for new games
9534000	9536000	And get new game announcements during the show
9536000	9538000	And I guess, I don't know
9538000	9540000	It kind of tries to bring this like
9540000	9542000	Legitimacy quote unquote
9542000	9544000	To the video game scene but I'm just kind of like
9544000	9546000	Eh, I don't need it
9546000	9548000	But for the record if you're curious what they nominated
9548000	9550000	Game of the Year, Call of Duty Black Ops
9550000	9552000	God of War 3, Halo Reach, Mass Effect 2
9552000	9554000	Red Dead Redemption
9554000	9556000	Those are the nominees for Game of the Year
9558000	9560000	Okay, no surprises there
9560000	9562000	Any other last minute stories, Loki?
9562000	9564000	I think that's
9564000	9566000	About it
9566000	9568000	Fan made Thief 2
9568000	9570000	Multiplayer beta has been released
9570000	9572000	So if you're a fan of Thief 2
9572000	9574000	And wish that you could have played it with more than one person
9574000	9576000	Then you might want to check it out
9576000	9578000	Alright
9578000	9580000	Well it's time for us to wrap up the show
9580000	9582000	And get on out of here for the night
9582000	9584000	And you know, so forth
9584000	9586000	So Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts
9586000	9588000	For our listeners tonight?
9588000	9590000	Money, I can have some?
9590000	9592000	Pinkberry!
9592000	9594000	Aw man, you just took mine, I was gonna say
9594000	9596000	My final thought is Pinkberry, can I have some?
9596000	9598000	But I'll just say
9598000	9600000	Four day vacation, can I has it?
9600000	9602000	Loki, your final thought tonight
9602000	9604000	My final thought
9604000	9606000	Is
9606000	9608000	I get to make turkey
9608000	9610000	Turducken?
9610000	9612000	No, it's just turkey
9612000	9614000	Turducken's just too, I don't think that'd be too much
9614000	9616000	What are you doing, are you
9616000	9618000	Since both you and the missus
9618000	9620000	Have parents locally, you kind of have to do like
9620000	9622000	Two thanksgivings at once, right?
9622000	9624000	Not necessarily, we're just having our way over to our house
9624000	9626000	Oh, smart
9626000	9628000	Smart, alright, good luck with that this year
9628000	9630000	Alright, that's it guys, we're
9630000	9632000	Out of here, have a wonderful night
9632000	9634000	And we'll see you next week, hey if you enjoyed
9634000	9636000	The show tonight, all we ask guys
9636000	9638000	Tell a couple people about the show
9638000	9640000	Tell folks that you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio
9640000	9642000	And help us spread the word, because you know guys
9642000	9644000	We don't have a huge website, we're not part
9644000	9646000	Of a gaming magazine or anything like that
9646000	9648000	We rely on word of mouth, so
9648000	9650000	Tell a couple people about the show, and if you think you've told
9650000	9652000	Everyone you can already, then please
9652000	9654000	Consider leaving us a nice review on iTunes
9654000	9656000	A five star review goes a long way in helping us
