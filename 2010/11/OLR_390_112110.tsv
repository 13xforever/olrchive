14035	26083	Tonight, November 21st, 2010, layoffs and downsizing hit four game studios, developers pay a premium to create for the 3DS, and did Nintendo give away a prototype version of a classic game?
31618	31958	DarkSakura
56317	56557	Hi.
56858	58219	Hi, how are you, DarkSakura?
58559	59119	Jamie Summers?
59500	59920	I'm alright.
60000	60981	Happiest bunny on the farm?
61421	63543	You seem like a little bit of a sad bunny tonight.
63723	65185	I am a little bit of a sad bunny, but it's alright.
65205	65665	Do you want a hug?
65685	66406	I'll come give you a hug.
66686	68668	I prefer the chocolate ones, thank you.
68708	69468	You need candy.
70189	70369	Yeah.
70529	73412	Alright, well I hope some discussion on video games will help brighten your spirits.
73452	77095	You know, I had a terabad week this week.
77255	78996	I mean, it was really awful.
79016	80718	Was it bigger than a gigabad?
81579	83200	It was a terabad, actually.
83520	84381	That's what I was saying.
85182	85502	It was.
87684	92849	But I did the other show, because now I'm juggling two shows just like you, and it actually put me in a lot better mood.
92990	95232	So podcasting hopefully will brighten your spirits.
95872	96113	Cool.
96473	98515	I was watching V before you came over.
98855	99757	New V or Old V?
99857	104384	New V. I stopped about halfway on New V. Not because I hated it.
105405	106667	It was hard for me to watch TV.
107348	111435	I caught up on Supernatural, so I was just sitting marathoning stuff because I didn't feel like doing anything.
112330	115632	I've heard a lot of people that kind of like watch TV while they play games.
115672	120894	A friend of mine on the WoW Guild was telling me about how he was leveling to 80 while watching Arrested Development on Netflix.
121114	121334	Fun.
121514	122255	So, yeah, good times.
122835	123055	All right.
123335	125996	Say hello as well to somebody who will hopefully make us laugh tonight.
126217	126957	If not, he's fired.
127117	127597	No, just kidding.
127617	128778	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
128878	129198	Hello.
129438	129978	How are you, Loki?
130138	130579	I'm fine.
130839	131119	All right.
131159	131879	What's new in your world?
132199	133560	Anything new, fun going on?
134082	136163	Not much, just eating bad-for-me pizza.
136403	137103	Is your mic even on?
137143	138804	We are having a real hard time hearing you tonight.
138824	139984	Did you plug me in the wrong hole again?
140044	140524	No, you're good.
141365	143245	We just had to get you angry in order to hear you, I think.
143305	145606	No, it's very quiet.
145726	147547	It's very, very quiet.
148387	149988	Live radio, some of the perks.
150068	151508	We'll try and fix his stuff.
151528	152669	Fix me now!
153449	154690	No, you're definitely fixed now.
154750	155030	All right.
157070	159151	Everybody's just all quiet and somber tonight.
159591	160352	Must be the weather.
160852	161732	The weather changing.
162192	163773	I call it complete and utter apathy.
164375	164796	I love rain.
164816	168601	I love rain a lot, but the whole problem with rain is that it makes me intensely homesick.
178860	181542	and also nobody can drive in the rain is the other big problem.
181562	182202	Nobody from here.
182763	184364	Yeah, big problem with the rain.
184804	188486	All right, if you've never listened to Orange Lawn Shady before, I haven't given this to people in a while so I'll just say hello.
189227	194430	If you've never listened to our show before, we do tape live and the three of us here, DarkSakura, myself and Loki, we all met.
194870	195270	Thanks for watching!
216360	217181	DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?
245354	248655	Um, kind of, not much of anything.
248715	256736	I played Star Trek Online for like an hour this week and, yeah, oh, Angry Birds.
258137	259617	The game is retarded and fun.
259797	262738	Why do you think so many people are into Angry Birds on the iPhone?
262778	267219	Like, I have to admit, it's not a game that's ever really interested me, but it seems like everybody is playing this game.
267239	268279	Because pigs aren't kosher.
270703	271083	Okay.
271804	273085	You fight evil pigs.
273405	273905	Oh, I see.
274345	275346	And they're not kosher.
275987	281090	So I kill them by toppling bricks on top of them until they poof and die.
281971	284812	And they get all beat up and bruised beforehand, so it's really great.
284852	286053	And you've got chickens that explode.
286113	288335	Poor piggies that can't defend themselves.
292438	293698	Well, they're idiot pigs anyway.
294339	299963	Maybe that'll be the sequel to Angry Birds, Idiot Pigs.
302292	303313	I found my Digimon.
304114	306717	It's way dead, but I found my old school Digimon.
308299	309800	The brick looking ones?
310441	311823	Like that were like the Tamagotchis?
312023	313224	Yeah, but they could connect.
313625	314646	I never knew they had those.
314666	316448	I always thought Digimon was just like a Game Boy game.
316608	317309	Well, and an anime.
317697	325080	Yeah, but they were actually made from, I think, the same company that did the Tamagotchi or something like that.
325100	329002	But anyway, you could connect the two end-to-end and they would battle.
330222	333503	And it finally is dead.
333543	334664	We finally just got rid of it.
334724	336284	We cleaned out a lot of stuff in the house.
336304	339126	I was going to say, the battery must have given out after all this time.
339566	344068	You leave a battery in something way too long, then it just goes bad.
344088	344928	Yeah.
347449	356894	We've got rid of a lot of stuff, but we're also setting aside, I guess, some swag for people, I guess.
358575	359436	Yeah, that's about it.
359536	360556	Oh, we picked a bread racer.
360636	362177	Did I say that already last week?
363698	364358	I don't remember.
365099	367200	Did you get some Leet 3D glasses to go with it?
367780	367940	No.
370991	392290	and uh yeah that's about it that's really about it all right Loki how was your gaming week what have you been playing this week um not as much as I was going to but I played basically Grand Theft Auto and some of the Kinect stuff like I was demonstrating the Kinect things for a few of my um fellow employees so a little bit of Kinect Adventures which is
393731	396592	Not surprisingly, getting very boring.
396612	405133	There's only so many times I can play the river rafting game or even the other games in there without going, eh, whatever.
405933	408954	Been playing more Dance Central, which is pretty fun.
410014	414815	Playing some of the more difficult songs, which aren't that difficult, but it's just different.
415855	417936	So I was playing Jungle Boogie a little bit.
418876	419016	And...
420516	421517	Yeah, more Grand Theft Auto.
421697	422597	That's pretty much it.
423758	429461	Some iPhones, iPods stuff, but not really anything worth mentioning.
429741	434344	I played a few games of the Stick Wars stuff.
436209	436809	Thanks for watching!
452751	454831	and I also have Lego Harry Potter but I haven't played that yet either.
455412	456612	Is that the one that's supposed to use Kinect?
456792	459532	Like I knew there was a Harry Potter game that uses Kinect in some fashion.
460413	463673	No, Lego Harry Potter, it's the one on the iOS stuff.
463753	464994	Oh, I'm sorry, you're still on iOS.
465034	465534	No, no, no.
465634	466974	There's no Lego, there's no Lego.
467094	470635	There's a Harry Potter in the Deathly Hallows part one.
470775	471515	Okay, that's what I think.
471535	476396	And it has like a little on-rails shooter portion that you can use Kinect for but apparently it's really dumb.
477056	478296	Well, it's early.
478736	481197	I think a lot of this stuff is like tech demos turned into games.
482717	483537	It's stuff tacked on.
484117	484738	Hey, you know what?
484878	485658	It's better than nothing.
486118	488198	You know, they could have just done nothing.
489359	493420	Do you find yourself still playing Kinect a couple weeks later?
493440	494880	Because I kind of stopped.
495820	496601	Yeah, Dance Central.
496761	496881	Really?
496901	498501	I've actually been playing Dance Central.
499581	500862	It's pretty fun, actually.
501042	504183	And funny enough, I got some of my other employees into it.
504263	505163	They were like really...
506324	507024	It was surprising.
507084	509886	People that I would not think that would try Dance Central.
509906	512288	I had one of my co-workers playing Just Dance.
512868	517972	This guy, you know, Purple Belt and Taekwondo and stuff.
519513	523856	Just not the person that would be playing that song.
524056	524416	You know what?
524436	525777	There's no shame in having fun.
526118	526778	No, not at all.
526818	528599	Even if the songs are a little fruity, it's fun.
530160	530941	He thought it was hilarious.
530981	533962	Yeah, it's fun.
534162	537784	The problem really is I don't have room to play it.
538144	539785	So I play it at work.
540185	542606	We have our game room, I guess.
542947	546228	It's in a conference room, so I take the conference room table that's split in two.
546768	549470	I push one to one end of the wall, one to the other end of the wall.
549490	554192	It gives me a good 10 feet by 10 feet space that I can actually play in.
554412	559236	You don't know how lucky you are to be able to turn in your conference room at work into a gaming hotspot.
559296	560517	It's amazing to me.
563208	565971	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
585308	589010	Yeah, I don't know how it happened either, but I had to make a phone call to Blizzard and all that.
589050	591151	At least you didn't swallow yours.
591171	592552	I don't know if you saw that story.
592632	593552	No, what happened?
593632	595794	Some person swallowed their authenticator.
596194	601336	No, mine's on my iPhone, and somehow it just reset, and I couldn't restore it from backup.
601917	602677	None of it would work.
602737	607640	It would just give me the new serial number, and you can't input your own serial number, so...
608780	609281	It was weird.
609381	617606	And then Wednesday, my guild got the first kill of the Lich King ever, but I wasn't there because I had to drop out of the raid because Comcast kept cutting out on me.
618006	619627	And so, yep, wasn't there.
620167	622128	So anyway, I won't get into all the details about it.
622189	623609	It's on the other show, Horde House, now.
624850	625670	That's kind of odd.
625710	627991	Now I don't get to go on these long Warcraft tangents on the show anymore.
628031	629372	You can still go on the tangents.
629392	630752	Yeah, but now I feel like I'm spent.
630812	631833	I already went on that tangent.
631853	632573	I don't want to do it again.
632953	634634	So yeah, it was an interesting week in Warcraft.
634674	636895	But let me talk about other games, because there were other games I was playing as well.
637835	644478	Maybe I wasn't playing the Kinect games so much, but I did kind of go on this demo downloading binge of stuff I've just kind of missed on.
645258	647879	One of those games I checked out was Super Meat Boy, which...
649521	651001	Actually, it was kind of cool.
651242	653562	The demo is very robust for that game.
655343	658943	I get the sense it's a Flash game that's been converted somehow.
658984	662364	Well, it's Newgrounds, so that was kind of a sign right there.
662704	664665	But it had a surprising amount of depth to it.
665105	670767	One of the mechanics I really liked is that you're on this Mario-style map doing all the little challenges.
671247	676168	But when you get an A+, meaning you beat the level within the par time...
676488	677009	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
691465	692225	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
710055	710596	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
731753	732453	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
758487	769832	The name Super Meat Boy and the artwork of like that red case with the weird funny grinning toothy thing made me, honestly, I kind of looked at it and went, what's this Super Meat Boy?
769852	770692	It sounds stupid.
771252	772193	That game sounds stupid.
772213	773053	That looks stupid.
773733	778055	It's kind of amazing how much judgment I passed on this game really not knowing dick about it.
778715	779936	And I was wrong.
780516	781216	I can admit that.
781276	782297	But at the same time,
783928	797971	I was a little kind of turned off by why didn't you try to like, I don't know, put a little more into the retro jokes like on the box art or something like that whole like red grinning face just was a little silly to me.
798651	799011	I don't know.
799071	803312	I'm sure I'm not even looking at chat because I'm sure I'm being taunted for being irrational right now.
803652	810654	But it did kind of make me step back and go, wow, you do kind of put a lot of thought into even like what's on the front of a box.
811614	826415	as to whether I'll pull it off the shelf and I realize it's all happening virtually whether I'll pull it off the shelf and read the back of the box so kind of interesting so again if you want to go chat.orangeloungeradio.com you can join us okay now I'm being brave and reading it there um
827876	828357	Let's see.
830298	831800	Sorry, I'm reading this live here.
832921	836645	DarkTetsuya says, Don't forget Alien Hominid was a Newgrounds game too.
836705	837085	That's true.
837145	838026	That was kind of a cool game.
838406	840528	The Castle Crashers, was that a Newgrounds?
840608	841830	It was the very same style.
842811	843651	Very similar style.
843671	847115	I think Behemoth did that and they had done Alien Hominid.
847135	847675	I think that's the deal.
847695	848896	They've done Alien Hominid, yeah.
849117	849297	Yeah.
849937	850078	So...
851979	854402	So I played that, and I definitely want to pick up the full version of that.
854482	861729	I also played Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, which I thought was kind of a worthy upgrade based on the demo I played.
862069	869336	You know, more maps, different skins looking thing, but they also made a couple big changes to the mechanic that make it worthy of an upgrade.
869436	872940	One of them is bombs, which I know sounds very weird for a Pac-Man game, but...
873380	880382	How often in Pac-Man do you get trapped in a corner where there's a ghost coming one way and there's a ghost coming the other way and you're like, oh shit, I'm fucked.
880762	885063	Now I realize that's the whole point of Pac-Man, but this being a sequel, you get to try new things.
885523	890825	So now you have a bomb and you can hit this bomb and it blows the ghost out of your way so you can get through.
891805	894906	It's a simple thing that kind of adds a whole new level to it.
894966	901928	I don't want to say it makes it easier, but now you can get yourself in different situations than you were able to before, if that makes sense.
902688	907170	The other thing that's kind of cool about the game is that you have these sleeping ghosts, we'll say.
907670	912171	These ghosts that just stand in place and don't do anything until you go right next to them.
912511	915212	And once you go right next to them, they'll wake up and start to chase you.
915552	916893	But they chase you in a very...
917933	919033	Thanks for watching!
935299	963611	Breeze fresh life into a game and I thought it was pretty awesome and the music was really cool so yeah I gotta say I haven't read on the net what the reception is to this game I don't know if people are saying unnecessary copy or whatever but I gotta admit I find the few little twists to really kind of bring new life into what was otherwise a game that you know was you know it's been on the iPhone and the Xbox and you know we kind of seen it several times over the past few years so I
964111	966192	I thought that was cool.
966232	970954	Go to our chatroom at chat.orange.radar.com Salacious Pop says, it's amazing, the music alone.
971275	976377	If you use a bomb on a chain of 40 plus ghosts and they all fly back into the base, it's a very epic, satisfying feeling.
976617	977237	That's very true.
977718	979078	I agree with that.
979378	981860	Blackwolf is clarifying an earlier comment I was saying.
981900	984721	Castle Crashers used new grounds for the music, at least.
985021	986502	That makes sense.
987822	990804	Definitely a lot of those games have the same look and feel and so forth.
991944	1000875	another game I checked out on Xbox Live again these are all demos and I always feel weird about reviewing demos but a lot of these were very robust and I think still
1002418	1009304	When you're going to put a demo of your game out there, you're kind of putting it out there to have your entire game judged.
1009604	1010985	Should I drop $10 on this?
1011086	1011686	Yes or no?
1011786	1013568	So I feel somewhat justified in that.
1014909	1018072	Pop is reminding me I also played Gwangi.
1019453	1022696	I don't even know how to pronounce this game, but I did play that on Xbox Live.
1023196	1029061	And I know we have a really diehard Shmup fan in the chat room that's going to really hate me for this, but I didn't get it.
1029341	1030042	I didn't get it at all.
1031220	1034802	I like that it was different, but I didn't understand what the hell I was doing.
1034822	1035863	It was just bullets everywhere!
1037563	1039945	Apparently there's reskin modes, but they're not really in the demo.
1039965	1042026	It was just the first level of the arcade game that was in the demo.
1042066	1043646	I had no idea what the F I was doing.
1044667	1045307	None.
1045407	1057273	It seems like a lot of the cave shooters that they're bringing over, no offense, it's like you could randomly show me different video from a bunch of different ones.
1057713	1058514	They all look the same.
1058614	1058774	Well,
1058974	1059534	Here's the thing.
1059754	1062735	Well, but to be fair, Loki, this game wasn't the same.
1062995	1077119	And that was kind of what... I mean, I will say I liked about it because what was cool about it is that, like, for one, this character I was playing, you didn't just fire bullets, but you had a wolf that you moved around the screen and bombs would fire from the wolf or something.
1077199	1077479	I don't know.
1077719	1078979	But it was a different mechanic.
1079459	1082060	So it didn't make it feel like every other shoot-em-up.
1082120	1084480	So I don't think you can say every shoot-em-up is the same.
1084921	1085521	It's just that...
1086701	1087382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1104138	1113122	If I spent more time with it, I'd probably enjoy it, or if I was more of a fan of the shoot-em-up games and really understood what was so different, I should have spent more time with it, really.
1113842	1122986	But again, demos were supposed to sell me on the full games, and after playing the demos I did this week, I'm like, I'm more interested in going back and playing more Super Meat Boy, which I never thought I'd say a couple weeks ago.
1123346	1130249	You heard that they have that to internets on there and stuff, that they unlock new levels every now and...
1130989	1134373	and every once in a while without sort of updates, I guess.
1134753	1135654	Are you saying Super Meat Boy?
1136035	1137676	Oh, no, I wasn't aware of that.
1137696	1138057	That's cool.
1138778	1142121	It seemed like there was a lot of people.
1142862	1147126	Ray in our chat room is a little irritated at what Loki just said.
1147687	1149289	I could say the same of any genre.
1149429	1150490	All MMOs are the same.
1150610	1151791	All fighting games are the same.
1151952	1153233	All genre are the same.
1153615	1157899	Yeah, but I'm saying that the actual artwork looks very similar game to game.
1158019	1160041	I'm not saying all shooters are the same.
1160081	1161062	That doesn't make any sense.
1161442	1164245	I'm saying that these games play very much alike.
1164445	1168068	Like, I've played a bunch of different cave shooters, and they play very similar.
1168108	1170951	I'm telling you, this doesn't play like the other ones.
1171051	1171631	Oh, big deal.
1171691	1173673	It's a different thing that they've added in there.
1173713	1174194	That's just...
1174674	1179198	It was, well, it was different because you could kind of fire at the bullets and stuff.
1181200	1183422	I don't think people should pass judgment so quickly.
1183442	1183762	It's fun.
1183902	1184523	It's still fun.
1184543	1185524	I'm just saying, you know.
1186264	1187265	At least try it out.
1187606	1188587	They're not like night and day.
1188647	1196534	It's not like comparing, you know, a Gradius game with, say, you know, Ikaruga or something like that.
1197034	1199995	Two games that have very different looks to them.
1200615	1203236	You know, maybe similar types of gameplay.
1203316	1204897	Obviously, Garuga would be a lot harder.
1205317	1207878	But, I mean, I don't know.
1208078	1211079	Maybe it's just because they're all done, you know, with spray animation and stuff like that.
1211139	1211760	But, I don't know.
1211840	1214261	It just seems very similar.
1215241	1218162	Like, I can... You can show me one of those games and I'm like, oh, yeah, that was a cave shooter.
1218842	1220643	It's like... I don't know.
1221984	1222404	I don't get it.
1222904	1224965	And why even bother having any storylines in it?
1225005	1225265	Because...
1226721	1251111	there's no point really and the last demo I played was for King of Fighters 2002 which I didn't get it because I never really played the Neo Geo fighting franchises past like Fatal Fury Special I think was about the last one with the exception of Capcom vs SNK which is still amazing but the problem is the demo only limits you to like a handful of characters none of which I recognized none of them
1251611	1256453	and all I did was I button masked the chick with a whip and I think her name was actually Whip.
1257293	1258253	Yes, her name is Whip.
1258934	1260394	And she's on Team Ikari.
1260554	1261374	Very creative.
1261414	1261834	Which game?
1262375	1263035	King of Fighters 2002.
1263475	1267716	No, she's actually a really cool character and if you're good with her, she's really effective.
1267876	1268957	But I always use Leona.
1269637	1271038	But who you can't pick in the demo.
1271138	1271519	I don't think.
1271539	1272340	I would have recognized her.
1272480	1273100	So I don't know.
1273200	1274742	I didn't get a good feel for that one from the demo.
1274762	1278385	She was on the same team with Leona, Clark, Ralph, Hayden.
1279666	1281327	She's, I guess, an Ikari theme.
1281347	1283269	In the one I picked, you weren't picking teams.
1283309	1284250	You were picking individuals.
1284270	1288693	But I'm saying that her story, her character comes from the whole Ikari team.
1288914	1289174	Gotcha.
1290969	1293110	God, you know what would be awesome?
1293310	1298573	They did a Marvel vs. Capcom game, but Capcom vs. SNK, do it in that style again.
1298853	1309237	Now, I know that they've had Capcom vs. SNK 1 and 2 and stuff, but the crazy over-the-top style that is Marvel vs. Capcom would be awesome.
1310901	1312623	or Fast as Marvel vs. Capcom or something
1338621	1342124	So that's pretty much all the games I played this week that are worth mentioning.
1342244	1347048	Although I did play Knights of the Clicky, Clicky Vampire, Sorority, Life, Farm, Town, Wars.
1347148	1348249	I played some of that too.
1350089	1350850	It's so sad.
1351630	1355052	Facebook games really are the future and there's really no depth to this game.
1355413	1356894	But aren't the boss fights really cool?
1357494	1361036	They do these little cut scenes and stuff that makes the whole game worth it to me.
1361056	1361577	They're alright.
1361617	1362337	You're in my party.
1363278	1365439	You're shaking your head disapprovingly, Loki.
1366540	1368561	You don't like Knights of the Clicky, Vampire, Mafia?
1368581	1372064	I haven't played it and I'm not going to play it.
1372084	1373945	I really shouldn't.
1374065	1376046	I really should not play that because you know why?
1376707	1379929	Because if people support games like that, they're just going to keep making games like that.
1380009	1380449	OrangeLunchFoodio.com
1400450	1402211	Thanksgiving is definitely right around the corner.
1419850	1420170	It is.
1421010	1422971	And we have to roast a turkey.
1423651	1424792	We haven't done turkey before.
1424832	1426112	Are you doing the dinner this year?
1426132	1430114	No, but we have to contribute another turkey, so I'm making the stuffing for it.
1430534	1433395	And I have a total recipe in my head for cranberry apple stuffing.
1433575	1434195	Cornbread stuffing.
1434555	1434655	Oh.
1434835	1436076	Because cornbread stuffing is the best.
1437076	1440037	I'm officially sick of bacon pizza, by the way, now.
1440277	1442458	I noticed you did not bring bacon pizza to the show tonight.
1442478	1443679	I was like, mushroomy pizza.
1443939	1444759	Or was it actually bacon?
1444779	1445879	No, that is bacon pizza.
1446140	1447000	It's like mushrooms.
1447460	1449161	They burnt the crap out of it.
1449541	1449701	Ew.
1450321	1451421	Yeah, thank you.
1452122	1453402	That does not look appetizing.
1453422	1456403	And I actually asked for quadruple bacon pizza, but she's like, triple bacon?
1456603	1458284	I don't think they understand more than three.
1459164	1460505	There are no human wants that.
1460525	1461445	I'm not worrying that for you.
1462746	1463246	No, it's...
1464710	1466111	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1490790	1492592	and it's just not as good.
1492652	1494716	Now if I had that, it would be so much better.
1494736	1504231	What you should tell them is that next time that they make it is to put your bacon on first and then put the cheese on top of it so that the bacon won't burn because the oil from the cheese will saturate the bacon and prevent it from burning.
1504955	1507116	It's like our own little Paula Deen right here in studio.
1507176	1509297	It's not so bad even with the burnt bacon.
1510437	1511417	It's just too much.
1512037	1512538	I cook.
1512858	1514858	Don't look at me like that because I love Paula Deen.
1515379	1516559	I think I need to go back to the compliment.
1516579	1529343	She's a frightening looking lady because she totally looks both Botoxed and surgical and still looks really scary old with those overly terrified looking eyes.
1529363	1529563	Okay, fine.
1529824	1533165	Paula Deen is like the Cher and you're like the Christina Aguilera.
1534265	1538747	It's because she's preserved her body with all that fat that she takes in.
1539107	1542768	I mean, my God, she's like, I need to put a stick of butter in this one.
1542948	1545109	Oh, wait, we need another stick of butter in there.
1545129	1547690	I seem to recall this was a video game podcast.
1547810	1549470	I don't really remember.
1549690	1551231	This is getting back to video games.
1551531	1552531	I'm just going to make my dinner.
1552611	1552911	That's fine.
1552931	1557073	I'm just saying that I'm probably going to stick to like cheese pizza or the twist.
1557093	1558093	The twists are damn good.
1558493	1560974	You know, have you thought about maybe like a salad?
1562176	1562676	Thanks for watching!
1582830	1583210	Thanks for watching!
1600677	1622294	I'm not gonna eat garbage alright housekeeping before we get into news we will still have a show next week I know the holidays are canceling some of your favorite podcasts but thankfully Sunday is kind of a nice day to be on so we will still be bringing you new shows tonight obviously and next week we're not gonna have any time off for the holidays we're working hard for you guys cause we love you
1623234	1627817	Also, if you want to love us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1627877	1630619	Please consider joining our little club there on Facebook.
1630959	1632720	And everybody likes to like things.
1633301	1636803	Yes, so you should like us on Facebook, which I think is actually what you do.
1636823	1638164	You don't actually join, you just like.
1638604	1646069	Because if people can like things like Chase Bank or Miracle Whip, then they can like our damn show.
1646369	1650191	Or RuPaul to host Saturday Night Live and all that stuff.
1650511	1651632	Although that really should happen.
1651932	1652632	No, it shouldn't.
1652652	1653153	Yes, it should.
1653173	1653693	I hate her.
1653833	1654273	I'm sorry.
1654533	1656194	She's not funny.
1656714	1657034	What?
1658334	1659095	Stop the show.
1659355	1660135	Stop the show.
1661175	1662196	She's not funny.
1662296	1664857	RuPaul is amazing.
1665437	1666797	Have you ever watched Drag Race?
1667158	1668318	Have you ever watched Drag Race?
1668358	1669318	I've seen an episode.
1669338	1672600	Then sit down and shut up because you're saying no in a creative way.
1672620	1673360	You're saying no.
1673400	1673580	I'm sorry.
1673740	1674820	You're trying to stretch the truth.
1674840	1675961	It would just be weird.
1676721	1699774	it's funny it is funny drag queens are funny all right fine then if you bring RuPaul on there you need to have at least more than one drag queen on there because it's just a show about nothing but drag queens competing to be the biggest cunt of them all well that's not Saturday Night Live that's why I'm saying you need more drag queens on there if you're gonna bring her on there
1702219	1705320	Those guys dress up as chicks all the time on Saturday Night Live.
1705420	1714562	This is the only video gaming podcast where you will hear a very straight guy arguing with a very gay guy about drag queens.
1715462	1717923	I'm just saying, RuPaul needs a video game.
1718283	1718923	You know you want it.
1718943	1720064	My gaydar went off from the kitchen.
1720104	1720864	I'm just telling you.
1721284	1722564	My gaydar went off from the kitchen.
1722584	1725105	If they made a game for Connect called You Better Work.
1726245	1726945	Okay, I'd get it.
1727266	1727666	See?
1729567	1735229	And you know you want RuPaul being all, alright, let's see that dance again, and don't fuck it up.
1735449	1738330	And, but Rob, alternate costume has to be the suit.
1739966	1740607	from DragU.
1742909	1749354	And it could film you on the Kinect device, but then as you do better, it just starts to put costume parts on you.
1749374	1750195	It would be really funny.
1750675	1754058	And then we make Loki play it and take pictures and upload them to the interwebs.
1754598	1755059	Hilarity.
1756280	1757081	I'm glad we live in reality.
1757101	1758242	That's up there with Tingle.
1759322	1760003	All right, anyhow.
1761584	1765668	Loomies, just join chat just to tell Loki to get a sense of humor.
1768952	1769413	Oh, Loki.
1769533	1769813	All right.
1770414	1771055	Also, Twitter.
1771115	1772997	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1773638	1775280	Not Twitter.com slash RuPaul.
1775660	1776061	Just saying.
1776441	1776662	All right.
1776702	1783310	Let's actually get into some video game news, which I'm only trying to make you laugh because the news we have is very depressing.
1783630	1784511	I think it's funny.
1784531	1785653	It's not me.
1785673	1787915	You are rude.
1788616	1789857	It's hilarious.
1789917	1795463	Bizarre Creations is closing because Activision is like, hey, you know what?
1795843	1801989	We decided to have a really terrible idea and release a Bond game that's based off of no movie whatsoever.
1802229	1809176	And we're going to pimp out Daniel Craig in it again because we apparently own the likeness of Daniel Craig for a long time now.
1809216	1810618	That's why he's also in GoldenEye.
1811578	1817540	But yes, Bizarre Creations, they've done some pretty awesome things and some pretty terrible things.
1818400	1822241	Awesome being their racing games, the Project Gotham Racing Series and Blur.
1822641	1824101	And Geometry Wars.
1825642	1828763	Yes, Geometry Wars, the awesome racing game.
1829463	1830043	What the hell?
1830103	1830943	You need to listen.
1831043	1833704	No, Geometry Wars is an amazing game.
1835006	1835906	Stop interrupting me!
1836006	1836346	No!
1836566	1837907	Yes, you shut up!
1839347	1863793	Anyways, other things that were awesome, non-racing, Geometry Wars, terrible things that they've released, The Club, yes, no, The Club, their shooter that wasn't quite good, and of course, James Bond, Bloodstone, which, not very good, but it also has some driving in there, but driving apparently is better than the Bond game.
1864904	1873671	Anyhow, so they're getting closed down because apparently they aren't making enough money for their pimps at Activision.
1874632	1885441	And apparently they're giving them a 90-day period, which I guess is serving as notice to the employees that their company is likely to be closed, sold, downsized, etc.,
1886641	1896128	and apparently Activision says over the past three years since our purchase of Bizarre Creations, the fundamentals of racing genres have significantly changed.
1896868	1905674	Although we made a substantial investment in creating a new IP blur, it did not find a commercial audience.
1908263	1917332	Mind you, that they're still keeping the Tony Hawk Ride franchise around, even though that's incredibly terrible.
1918813	1930485	But, you know, Blur, a racing game that probably had a decent following, just not exactly, you know, Tony Hawk Ride numbers maybe, which I do know that they sold more than Tony Hawk Ride, by the way.
1931325	1944730	um and then of course you know they're developers and whatever and uh there is a chance though that they may be purchased by somebody else so um obviously cause you know Project Gotham Race is an awesome series so
1946329	1951354	It's funny how they sucked when they were bought by Activision, but they were still pretty awesome when they were with Microsoft.
1951374	1954316	Could it happen to be maybe Activision is to blame?
1955277	1955497	Maybe?
1955938	1956378	Hey, Jamie.
1957199	1957599	Knock, knock.
1957879	1958220	Who's there?
1958560	1959281	Interrupting cow.
1959801	1960482	Move!
1961703	1963725	Because that's all I know how to do is interrupt people.
1965526	1968309	Well, you weren't listening, obviously, because you're like, hey!
1969670	1970290	Guess what?
1970370	1971931	Geometry Wars was awesome!
1972231	1973091	Hey, listen!
1973211	1976632	I just feel, you know, that's the number one thing to mention.
1976652	1980933	You're right, it was an awesome game, but it wasn't an awesome racing game, which is what I was talking about.
1980953	1982253	Well, maybe it should have been.
1982433	1984853	Maybe they should have had Geometry Wars racing.
1985634	1988734	Blur was actually kind of like that, a little bit.
1989234	1992835	It did have the whole shoot-em-up and the whole little art thing going on with it.
1993215	1994456	Honestly, when I saw Blur...
1996896	1999577	I couldn't get... It wasn't very interesting to me.
2000037	2002078	Split Second was more interesting to me.
2002638	2012601	Part of the problem with Blur is that it came out the same week as Split Second, Mod Nation Racers, while Mario Kart is still selling big.
2013882	2014962	It's just kind of unfortunate.
2017062	2017383	I don't know.
2017403	2020323	Did Bizarre Creations really deserve to bite the bullet?
2020744	2021224	I don't know.
2021324	2022564	I think you hit the nail on the head.
2022904	2025045	They were doing fine until Activision bought them.
2025714	2031775	Well, Activision, they're like, hey, you know, we need you to make some better stuff, so we're gonna have you do a James Bond game.
2032855	2038436	Honestly, I can't think of a James Bond game since Goldeneye that has sold well.
2039596	2042197	And those are the ones normally based off movies.
2042857	2055099	This was based off of nothing, so their excuse was, well, you know, since there's a lawsuit going on right now with the James Bond licensing and stuff, so, you know, hey, this is the closest thing you're gonna get to a new movie.
2056008	2060253	Well, that's great and all, except no one cares.
2061615	2063958	And I don't know.
2064058	2065300	It's just a terrible idea.
2067612	2093199	another company also taking some cuts thanks to Activision is Budcat and Budcat of course they were one of the developers that was acquired to work on Guitar Hero franchise and of course it says they're approximately 88 positions or approximately 1% of our global workforce has been affected by the layoffs so that's
2094526	2096067	1% is not bad, I guess.
2096688	2099609	It says Budcat, though, is comprised of roughly 60 people.
2099950	2103372	So, I don't know.
2104292	2105013	It's interesting.
2105053	2114259	I guess they were saying that they're doing, they're targeting reduction in jobs for its QA department.
2115920	2123885	I guess that makes sense because, I mean, they hire and fire people for QA all the time based on the games that are coming out.
2124844	2126805	Thank you for watching!
2144816	2145377	and Activision.
2169657	2170337	Thank you for watching!
2197869	2204172	I hate to say it because it's never happy news to report on game studios closing, but unlike the last one, this one makes a little more sense.
2204552	2217057	We know there's been too much saturation of the Guitar Hero games, so to hear that one of the studios that's been making all these unnecessary ports, sorry, that's how I feel, is shutting down, makes more sense than the last one you reported on.
2218037	2225380	Especially with the story we're going to get into here in a minute, which you know is inevitable about the music games kind of slowing down as it is.
2226997	2228559	I don't know if they are slowing down.
2229880	2236890	I think people have their expectations wrong on some of these games, but we'll get into that a little bit later.
2238512	2240935	I just don't agree with what they're saying.
2242252	2256519	LucasArts, another company that's not Activision is also confirming layoffs and they're saying that they're committing to their internal development and they're saying that recently they've made minor adjustments in staffing
2257419	2276797	and that it will help them better address the needs of the business and they remain committed to their internal studio and fostering relationships with trusted external partners in order to develop blah blah blah blah in other words they just let some people go and outsource
2278863	2304890	and of course they had let go some of their staff I guess earlier this year as well back in September and yeah I guess this is I don't know if it's necessarily to do with poor sales in different games or what not but honestly LucasArts doesn't have a lot of games coming out each year it's maybe one or two titles a year so
2307253	2310676	I don't know, it's kind of to be expected, I guess, since they just finished the big title.
2311617	2313038	Yeah, I guess.
2313198	2316120	I mean, still kind of sucks, but okay.
2316520	2319062	What's going to happen when they run out of Star Wars games to make?
2319983	2320984	I don't think they ever will.
2322485	2323066	They never will.
2323106	2326889	Besides, they have the huge MMO coming out, although I guess that's really Bioware, but whatever.
2328450	2340338	And then finally, 745 Studios, the company behind the game, PowerGig, they also said that they are laying off people.
2341038	2349224	Apparently, approximately 20 to 30 people were let go, most of which were in the QA team and a bunch of full-time staff.
2350064	2357887	and, of course, they're saying that with PowerGig already on the store shelves, last week's 7.45 studio is restructured.
2357927	2364069	The company has both a part of the natural cycle in game development and the focus on development needs of its upcoming game projects.
2365447	2373450	Also, the fact that their games scored really poorly as far as reviews go was not a good game, unfortunately.
2374710	2375850	And this is the studio.
2375870	2378811	Thanks to everyone who contributed to their first game, Power Gear Rise of the Sixth Dream.
2379232	2383333	And we wish the individuals impacted by the reorganization all the best.
2386725	2388968	Lots of people getting let go right before the holidays.
2389729	2392191	I feel like this is like an echo of what happened last year.
2392271	2393873	It's just sad.
2394874	2400040	I guess it's to be expected, but these are the folks that bring our games.
2400680	2408369	I think it makes sense because if you think about it, maybe these games for some of these smaller companies, not necessarily Activision and Bazaar and stuff like that,
2409149	2437899	some of the smaller companies like 745 I would think that they're developing the game and stuff they don't really need a large QA team until they're getting the product all fleshed out and then they're going to hire people in and unfortunately QA a lot of the testers and stuff it's not as glamorous as the tester would like you to think it's really just like minimum wage shit job that you take and you get hired and fired
2438419	2442722	You know, pretty regularly, so it's not a big shock.
2443362	2455931	Yeah, I mean, I hate to say it, but especially when you consider that Power Gig has come out now and it's kind of landed with this big, you know, unfortunately it makes this news a lot less surprising.
2456451	2459214	But to its credit, it is better than Rock Revolution.
2459234	2461637	But to its credit, it is better than Rock Revolution.
2478274	2479635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2502614	2522988	you know we're not looking at another huge video game crash or there's going to be no jobs in gaming whatsoever I think there will be other opportunities it just might not be the same type of game or the same studio as before so hopefully these guys land on their feet somewhere else you know what I mean like there wouldn't have been a power gig in the first place if Guitar Hero and Rock Band hadn't done so well right
2524451	2526233	Music Game Revenues
2546429	2563137	apparently it was 1.6 billion in 2008 and where they are today under 250 million for the year so far and they say short of a Christmas miracle music games won't break 400 million for all of 2010 so that would be what a quarter of where they were in 2008
2565638	2572500	So, while that is kind of sad, I also kind of go back and say, okay, well, wait a minute.
2572660	2578321	2007 was the first year that Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 came out.
2578941	2585863	So, to go January, October of 08, that was the period when everybody was playing it over at their friends' houses and all that.
2587083	2589424	Yeah, and I don't know, I mean...
2591107	2591908	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2613601	2614522	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2630193	2631154	Here's my thought, though.
2631514	2633375	And I'm going to bring this full circle.
2633475	2633715	Watch.
2634235	2639597	To say that music games are declining and on their way out the door is an extremely ignorant statement to me.
2640158	2649142	Because it's no different than, remember earlier in the show when you were speaking about Gwang, and you were saying it was like every other cave shooter, and somebody took issue with that?
2649622	2652003	For me, it's very similar to what's happening here with music games.
2652383	2655264	I don't think the period of music games is over by any means.
2655645	2658446	The period of plastic guitars and plastic drums...
2659026	2683825	is satiating there's not anything else you can really do with this you know what I mean I mean Rock Band 3 is trying with the keyboards and so forth but you know it's it's unfortunately not really gonna be enough that doesn't mean music games are dead look at Dance Central it's probably the I can say pretty confidently it's the best-selling Kinect game right now that isn't the one that's packaged in with the Kinect that and Kinect supports are probably the two big ones
2684125	2689168	Still, though, to be, you know, doing that well kind of shows that maybe there's a future there.
2689489	2692371	And maybe other types of music games that haven't quite been thought of yet.
2692451	2696733	You know, believe me, guys, we've been following music games for a very long time here on OLR.
2696794	2697594	Here's a perfect example.
2697614	2698815	Ten years ago, it was DDR.
2699335	2704919	Then it was, you know, before that, even Parappa the Rapper, Busta, you know, just all these other games.
2704939	2705599	Perfect example.
2705880	2708381	What do you think the top Wii title was for October?
2709482	2711283	For October, the top Wii title?
2711563	2711944	Yeah.
2712044	2713665	Probably, it's still Wii Play.
2714710	2714850	No.
2715390	2720112	And you would think maybe it might be Kirby's, you know, the epic yarn or whatever.
2720172	2727155	No, it's going to be something a lot more like every adult picks it up for the family.
2727475	2728475	It's going to be something family.
2728515	2729176	It's a Wii party.
2729576	2730156	It's a Wii party?
2730576	2731256	It's Just Dance 2.
2731316	2731376	Ah.
2733958	2739523	and not even close for second place.
2739844	2748892	Just Dance 2 for the month of October and this is since it was released because I believe it came out the second or third week of October.
2749053	2749773	It sold 285,556 units.
2754317	2777028	um compare that with second place which would have been Wii Fit Plus with balance board because you know those games um you know Tennis L and Wii Party of course shortly after that uh Wii Fit Plus $89,000 so it you know oversold it by more than double and same with um Wii Party, Wii Party was $92,000 um
2780590	2809572	so you know it's you can't really see that the music genre is dead because these games are just doing crazy well Just Dance the first one number 8 for October and it's sold actually I just want to say real quick to be fair in the Gamasutra and I'm not interrupting you I promise to be fair in the original Gamasutra report they are acknowledging that Dance Central could be a new opportunity for where this is going but nowhere in this report does it mention Just Dance
2810183	2814185	It should, and here's another cool fact.
2814685	2819748	Games like Wii Fit and stuff like that have sold a lot.
2819888	2823550	Four million copies launched to date.
2824271	2825071	Some other stuff.
2826232	2829974	Real quick, I'm trying to find another game that would have been a real big one here.
2830154	2830894	Let's see here.
2833636	2834336	Okay, here we go.
2834516	2835336	Metroid Other M.
2836878	2840722	I guess that's kind of a poor comparison because it didn't do well all the way.
2840782	2843866	Well, yeah, Reggie acknowledged it's not doing as well as it would like.
2843886	2844987	187,000 life from launch.
2846349	2847270	Okay, here we go, here we go.
2847710	2848891	How about like a Mario Party 8?
2849252	2850914	I mean, that's arguably a pretty good one.
2851474	2854017	See, that did 3.2 million launch to date.
2854658	2855920	And, you know...
2859097	2860380	Just Dance 1.8 Million Units
2871248	2898631	in closing and here's kind of my closing thought with this this whole report here does not really sound like a referendum on music games so much as it is a referendum on harmonics and maybe trying to make sense of why Viacom suddenly wants to unload them because you know even though it's talking about Guitar Hero and Rock Band I'm sorry Guitar Hero was still a harmonics franchise yes it's been turned over to somebody else since then but harmonics made that first game that everything else has been modeled after
2900212	2906417	Everything that's happened in the Guitar Hero franchise has been a ripoff of something Harmonix has done since Harmonix left the building, right?
2906857	2908258	Is that really an unfair thing to say?
2909879	2915503	So this is more speaking to, in my opinion, Harmonix than it is music games.
2916164	2927352	Because nowhere in here are we talking about the Just Dances of the World or the Konami DDR, which I'm sure is really nothing to scream about, but it's still out there cooking and it's poking along.
2928212	2930715	Unfortunately, that is the future of Rock Band.
2931936	2933498	It's going to be like the DDR releases.
2934579	2942127	It will have its loyal following forever and ever and it will still get its yearly releases but they're going to unfortunately probably be a little more and more meh.
2942472	2963888	but here's the thing I think Harmonix is a studio that knows better and will continue to innovate and such like they're trying to do with Dance Central which you know it seems to be working out well for them and who knows whatever else they're going to bring out in the future maybe something else connect maybe that whole rumored revival of the amplitude frequency style game who knows anyhow
2965305	2966806	Maybe I've spoken too long on this, I don't know.
2966826	2970209	But if you want to join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2970970	2974113	Some folks talking about Dance Masters and maybe arcade games.
2975274	2975634	Let's see.
2976535	2981460	Dark Tetsuya saying, so if Konami could get with them to put out Dance Masters, they could put it in arcades.
2982841	2987244	Oh, Izam says, music games aren't out the door, they're just not the cash cow everyone wanted them to be.
2987484	2988404	They were for a while.
2988905	2997871	You know, I can see, see that's one thing that's kind of cool about the Kinect and the way it's set up, is an arcade release wouldn't be that difficult for them.
2998431	3004335	I mean, it's seriously, since there's no controller involved, you just use the same damn technology and away you go.
3005556	3007457	Nothing like this lasts forever.
3007758	3013602	Any type of fad in gaming or really anything it is, movies even, nothing like this lasts forever.
3014102	3015563	Remember teen comedies?
3016123	3024209	When American Pie came out, we had every teen comedy in the world came out over the next couple years, and then suddenly they didn't all start doing well.
3024689	3029372	It doesn't mean teen comedies are gone forever, but it's just you don't see as many of them, right?
3029673	3034396	Or if they do come out, they're not the gross-out stuff like American Pie was.
3034416	3034616	Exactly.
3034756	3038718	People, they try to figure out what the trends are.
3038778	3048044	There's certain companies that will create those trends, and then there's other companies that will try to mimic those trends and try to capitalize on them.
3048084	3049704	And some of them do a good job of it.
3049765	3055928	Like, for example, when Activision, when Guitar Hero first came out, that was a good franchise.
3055948	3060971	And then you had EA come out with Rock Band, of course, both developed by the same company.
3061451	3063232	Thanks for watching!
3078357	3086866	And really, how much more can you do other than adding new instruments to make these games any more unique or exciting or whatever?
3086906	3092172	I mean, other than the song lists, I guess, and peripherals, it would just be, there's not much you can do with it.
3092232	3093273	It hasn't been thought of yet.
3093693	3097698	Who knew three years ago we would be looking at a game like Dance Central?
3098598	3099920	I don't think any of us could have predicted that.
3102424	3105566	I could have seen something like that, especially with the eye toy stuff.
3105586	3106247	It just didn't work well.
3106267	3107627	Easy to say now.
3107847	3109028	It just didn't work well before.
3109648	3114091	And I think a lot of us wrote it off then as the trend that was going to go away.
3114191	3114731	You know what I mean?
3115992	3119994	Oh, we saw this done on the eye toy and it was kind of ridiculous at best, so bye.
3120895	3123356	So who knew that the technology would be there later on?
3123818	3126602	Perfect example of people trying to capitalize on this stuff.
3128404	3135933	It's funny, they actually have another dance game for the Kinect that we haven't really heard of because it's only the European market's Dance Paradise.
3136054	3138517	Yeah, I remember a story on this one that had come up briefly.
3138917	3139878	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3166096	3167097	It's just not done well.
3167197	3171681	And the problem is you're going to get a lot of these companies, especially if Dance Central does really, really well.
3172021	3173682	They're going to release their dance games.
3174043	3176505	They're just going to be probably terrible.
3176965	3179707	I bet you anything Dance Central does really well.
3180728	3182770	Well, we've already got the trademark for Dance Hero.
3183430	3184231	How much you want to bet?
3185132	3185412	All right.
3185712	3189635	I want to say this real quick comment from our good pal Bobby Blackwolf is in the chat.
3190155	3193738	I want the inevitable Glee ripoff based on a marching band.
3194118	3195480	Someone make this trend happen.
3195520	3197461	That is one trend I'm not looking forward to.
3197601	3200583	By the way... Is all the Glee ripoffs coming next season.
3200784	3205147	By the way, because you know the Glee game, Karaoke Revolution, I mentioned there's a sequel on the way.
3206368	3206928	Glee 2.
3208169	3209590	Road to... What was it?
3209650	3211312	Road to Regionals is the...
3214505	3216427	Will it have Teenage Dream in it?
3217227	3217688	Can't wait.
3218628	3219029	Yay.
3219689	3222571	Now I know what to buy DarkSakura for Christmas, except she'll throw it at me.
3224353	3225293	Or Hanukkah, excuse me.
3226214	3226715	Christmaka.
3229997	3233420	If I bought you Glee the video game on Wii, how quick would I be wearing the box?
3235009	3237390	I don't know, I'd have to actually get Becky over here to play it.
3238051	3244715	I wouldn't play it, but she loves Glee, so I would let her play it, and then I would go trade it in and get a good game.
3245235	3249778	But see, that's what karaoke revolution has become to Konami.
3250118	3252499	I don't think they take it seriously anymore.
3252539	3255341	It's like, well, how can we get more attention to this?
3255861	3258363	I know, let's attach Glee to it.
3258703	3261645	Just like, I know, let's attach American Idol to it.
3262425	3262545	It's...
3263846	3273515	How long, and I can tell you how long, it's because once that show actually launches, how long are we going to have Karaoke Revolution X Factor Edition?
3273575	3276298	I mean, seriously, that's going to be the next thing they have.
3278740	3281103	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3294739	3295039	Yeah.
3295659	3304383	Well, actually, it's going to have a feature where you don't have to load the whole thing onto your hard drive, which is actually supposed to take about 40 minutes to do.
3305863	3306163	Wow.
3306783	3307344	Yeah.
3307664	3310685	It needs 6.4 gigabytes of hard drive space.
3311645	3324611	Um, but what you can do is you can actually just opt not to and let stuff load as it will, but what it does as it loads is that it loads what you're playing onto your hard drive.
3324631	3327052	So you're installing it in fragments.
3328616	3333578	So it's copying over what you need for that particular race before you race.
3334278	3339860	And of course, say that you do new content, well, you've got that going on.
3340120	3342000	And then say you go back to an old race, well, it's already there.
3342020	3346162	You don't have to worry about waiting for it to really load unless it's going to be going off hard drive.
3347182	3349544	Interesting, and I wonder if it, does it use any idle times?
3350024	3351286	I don't know if this is even out there or not.
3351726	3354868	Like while you're on menus and stuff maybe to be doing some of the loading as well?
3355769	3357371	I'm sure it will be.
3358812	3361614	But the number of cars is listed on here as 1,031 cars.
3361854	3362635	And that's pretty crazy.
3362655	3364156	That's a lot of cars.
3367739	3372660	Yeah, it's actually the largest install that's going to be on PS3.
3372880	3380743	I mean, other big ones were Devil May Cry and End War and Bioshock 2 and Lost Planet.
3380823	3387985	They were around the 4.5-5 gig range, and this is 6.4, so it's big.
3388745	3392306	And for our European listeners, it will be out on November 24th.
3395373	3396234	That's an eventual.
3396314	3397435	That's also for us, yeah.
3398095	3399356	It's a worldwide launch thing.
3399556	3401618	I was confirming.
3404259	3404640	Men.
3405941	3406801	Are you going to pick it up?
3407161	3408482	Is it a game that interests you?
3409123	3409843	Well, I won't.
3409903	3410504	Dan will get it.
3410744	3411044	I see.
3413186	3419250	He's the one who sits here and waits for all the new episodes of Top Gear to come out so you can watch them on the internet.
3419910	3420571	Oh, give me that.
3421860	3423721	I'm trying to open this new little toy I bought.
3424241	3424541	Sorry.
3426082	3427382	DarkSakura is using her nails.
3427842	3428763	Maybe scissors?
3428903	3429203	I don't know.
3429463	3429723	All right.
3429803	3430763	Anyhow, let's move on.
3430823	3431223	More news.
3431784	3436425	Nobody wants to hear about my package opening drama, except for the fact, why do they make packages so difficult to open?
3436845	3437706	So people can't steal them.
3437726	3438306	Loss prevention.
3439406	3439746	Still.
3440947	3442487	And because they're so fragile.
3442768	3443988	Just have the cameras and the beepers.
3444748	3445028	Yeah.
3445208	3446249	Of course, that never works either.
3446269	3449450	The beepers always go off, even when I legitimately bought them.
3450894	3453418	Just to let everyone know, I'm using the scissors I stole from work.
3454599	3457603	From the place of which I am officially no longer employed.
3458024	3458845	Way to stick it to him.
3460127	3462951	Yeah, I'll take some scissors, sure.
3465238	3468199	So, we were talking a little bit about the Kinect and Dance Central and stuff.
3468219	3469840	Well, Kinect has actually sold pretty well.
3469880	3472342	It's already moved a million units in the first 10 days.
3472862	3477145	And they're saying it's on track to hit their goal of 5 million this year.
3478246	3479306	I have a little problem with that.
3479747	3491374	Because GameStop and me personally, based off of what I've seen coming from Microsoft, they're saying there's shortages of this product.
3491494	3492334	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3518921	3519281	I don't know.
3519521	3523523	I just know that there's a lot of them on eBay going over retail.
3523843	3529786	People are crazy and of course they're going to say, oh yeah, it's hard to get.
3530306	3533888	It's going to be one of the must-have things definitely this holiday.
3537530	3543573	If you're interested in buying one and especially if you're looking to put it under the Christmas tree or in a stocking or
3544423	3546184	Whether, you know, festive.
3546204	3547745	That's kind of a big thing to put in a stocking.
3547765	3548645	That's a really big sock.
3550006	3552207	Well, some people have really big stockings.
3552427	3552767	Okay.
3552787	3553648	Okay.
3554428	3559671	If it's something you're looking to purchase for Christmas or a holiday or whatever, give as a gift.
3560271	3561572	You probably want to start looking now.
3562852	3563773	Don't wait until the last minute.
3565013	3565353	All right.
3566494	3567095	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3588646	3588986	I don't know.
3589026	3591789	I know Sony put out something and said, oh, yeah, the move's done well.
3593730	3602878	Fortunately, the MPD and stuff, they don't really track accessory sales, which is what this would be kind of considered, I guess.
3603919	3605541	So I don't know.
3607022	3607402	That's all right.
3607442	3608764	Maybe we'll find out in a future episode.
3609344	3613525	Alright, well moving on to some news about Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
3613665	3620788	We have a release date for the game, so I know this is something DarkSakura is going to pick up or make Dan get for her.
3621688	3625549	What a perfect opportunity, DarkSakura, just in time for Valentine's Day.
3625649	3626489	Actually, a little bit late.
3626809	3628450	February 15th, 2011.
3629230	3635312	So if you're willing to put Valentine's Day on hold by one day, you can make it a Marvel meets Capcom and falls in love day.
3635972	3636473	You know what?
3637134	3642841	We typically play games on Valentine's Day, so he can get me that instead of a bunch of roses.
3642881	3643261	I don't care.
3643982	3648768	At least he won't bitch about how much this costs instead of the roses.
3648848	3650310	Just dip the box in chocolate.
3650370	3653474	To be fair, this game would probably be cheaper than the roses.
3653973	3656595	You know, I always tell him that I want one, and he buys me a dozen.
3657876	3659477	And I'm like, dude, I want one.
3660098	3661579	Maybe he thinks you mean one dozen.
3663680	3665142	Alright, the game is coming out.
3665262	3669245	It's going to be out on February 15, 2011 on the 360 and the PlayStation 3.
3669285	3670125	You're up.
3670145	3673007	You have to wait just a few more days, so you're going to have to make it Valentine's Week.
3673068	3674749	February 18th is the day for you guys.
3675129	3699917	There is a regular and special edition And the special edition will cost you 70 bucks Now, in the news of more characters There are some more characters announced for the game She-Hulk and Zero are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 I love She-Hulk, she's so awesome She-Hulk is female Hulk And Zero, of course, is from the Mega Man franchise I wonder if she's also going to break the fourth wall Since they're letting Deadpool do it Why not?
3700037	3701398	Well, she does it in her own comic, too
3702518	3703339	I don't see why they wouldn't.
3704199	3705580	Be a good thing to do there.
3705600	3706561	So those characters are coming out.
3706881	3709903	I believe I was reading something about they're the special edition characters, too.
3710023	3713265	So if you want all the characters, you gotta shell out the extra money.
3713485	3718268	Which, no, the special edition character, that was... Oh, no, I take that back.
3718388	3719129	It's this other one.
3719229	3721590	Jill Valentine is one of the special characters.
3721690	3723071	And Shuma Gorath.
3723412	3726534	I have to tell you, we always call Shuma Gorath Shuma-chan.
3727274	3731437	Because apparently Shuma Gorath is supposed to be female, but also a really bad tentacle rape monster.
3731697	3731837	Ha!
3732521	3734883	Seriously, Shemagrath is this giant eyeball with a bunch of tentacles.
3736064	3737364	Alrighty, yeah.
3737405	3740927	I was going to say maybe a boss monster, but I guess it's not.
3741167	3744890	Shemagrath was also in... Kind of like Medusa on crack.
3745090	3746431	It was in... Two.
3746991	3748612	No, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter.
3749833	3751074	So, there you go.
3751174	3752095	In the special edition...
3752475	3761780	We'll also get you exclusive artwork, a steelbook case, a one month subscription to Marvel's online digital comic service.
3761840	3762801	That's kind of interesting.
3763161	3769725	And a prologue comic that will be 12 pages that will explain why there's a contest between these two universes.
3769945	3771286	So they're going to retcon this whole thing.
3771386	3773647	Which I'm sure will also be explained in the intro.
3775108	3777149	But comics are different.
3778443	3783087	Remember, that comic will probably be scanned and put online immediately.
3796369	3801094	Well, given that I read a lot of my comics digitally anyway, it's just fine by me.
3802335	3807501	Actually, Tiara and I share a subscription to Marvel Digital Comics already.
3807521	3808782	Oh, very cool.
3809400	3811441	Yeah, so... Alright.
3812141	3815261	It's mostly old comics and a lot of them actually do have in print.
3816162	3817142	But it's still pretty cool.
3817622	3825624	And I've always... Did it say that it was just a digital comic or one of the Marvin... Motion Comics?
3826564	3828945	It's the subscription to their digital comic service.
3829105	3831145	I didn't catch that.
3831505	3833486	They were going to release another comic.
3834759	3836180	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3860273	3862474	and there's been some pretty neat little touches in there.
3862854	3872697	Now, Marvel, I'm really happy for you and I'm going to let you finish but Capcom vs. SNK was the best crossover fighting game of all time so I'm looking forward to maybe that being next year.
3874057	3874537	Just saying.
3876078	3879499	More news stories and then release dates coming up in just one moment.
3879539	3880039	Dark Sakura.
3880836	3887278	Well, in other news, we have a bit of a cost issue with development on the 3DS.
3888578	3898821	It's going to be expensive, as in probably three times as expensive as doing DS games.
3899141	3900842	One time as expensive for every dimension.
3901902	3902162	Yeah.
3903340	3910350	They basically sang between 50 million and 150 million yen per 3DS title.
3911212	3911993	So, um...
3914358	3916559	That's a lot of money.
3918159	3920900	Here's an example.
3921721	3929543	Gaming actually reported that Japanese studios spend between 4.4 million and 43.9 million on a DS title.
3930423	3935165	And we're talking 50 million to 150 million yen.
3936545	3937926	Yikes, that's a lot of money.
3938314	3946722	Yeah, and just to put that into perspective, at least for our UK listeners, they were spending roughly £33,000 to £333,000.
3946762	3948563	And then the estimated cost is going to be...
3956129	3956429	A lot.
3956449	3957189	A lot.
3957209	3957450	A lot.
3981178	3993024	I guess that's true, but they were saying if your game at all is calculating a type of Z-axis to render 3D in a 2D TV, if you know what I mean, it's very easy to translate that into the 3DS.
3993644	3998187	And remember, they were showing those demos of the 8-bit games that were redone.
3998267	4004470	And not just 8-bit, but they had the Zelda, Ocarina of Time was out there, and Star Fox was out there, and...
4004830	4018496	I would imagine that they wouldn't be too difficult to develop that kind of stuff because all they have to really do is create a second virtual camera that's gonna be, you know, one for each eye and that's how you create your depth for rendering purposes, but I don't know.
4018676	4022438	So I'm surprised to hear it's three times as much money.
4022738	4024619	I mean, okay, a little bit more expensive.
4024779	4031642	Perhaps that will stave off some of the shovelware that may appear on that platform.
4032342	4035444	That might be a nice side effect, but I sadly don't think you're right.
4037205	4040928	It's only a matter of time before those development costs come down, right?
4042589	4049934	Well, as technology catches up with it too, I think, but this is still mostly speculation, I think.
4051535	4056638	Once they actually get practical costs out of it, once it's in motion, then we'll be looking at something a little different.
4057606	4057946	All right.
4058127	4058787	Well, we'll see.
4059047	4063271	We'll see if spending the money was worth the effort in just a few months.
4063551	4064712	I can't believe I'm saying a few months.
4064792	4065252	Yeah.
4065272	4067474	3DS is out for us all to consume.
4067854	4068074	All right.
4068094	4073298	In the meantime, let's see what's coming out a little more sooner for us to consume.
4073819	4074980	That was the worst transition ever.
4075240	4075400	Good.
4075640	4077702	You know we're going to have huge mungus lists.
4079803	4081445	Anyhow, what's coming out of the U.S.?
4081565	4082866	Black Friday is right around the corner.
4083006	4083226	Yes.
4083286	4085688	Can't wait to see what Steam is selling on Black Friday.
4085908	4087309	I was just telling Dan that earlier.
4088150	4093773	Hey, apparently the whole game for Windows thing, 10 cents for Age of Empires 3 today, and I'm sure that's been everywhere.
4093853	4096315	Yeah, but it's Age of Empires 3.
4096855	4099257	I have zero cents interest in that game.
4099277	4102499	I mean, I think it's great that there's bargain basement, but the game's like five years old.
4103540	4104680	No one cares anymore.
4105921	4107462	Now that it's 10 cents, people do.
4107882	4109624	I could get a game for 10 cents.
4110484	4111585	It's five years old.
4111645	4113166	It wasn't selling any copies anyway.
4114407	4114667	Anyhow.
4115051	4123476	Today marked the release of Raving Rabbids Travel in Time for the Nintendo Wii, as well as Donkey Kong Country Returns, which I hear is pretty good.
4124256	4125657	That is also on the Wii.
4126537	4129559	This week, not a whole lot coming out, but some pretty cool stuff.
4129939	4134482	Red Dead Redemption, the Undead Nightmare Collection on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4134782	4138824	That is the Undead Nightmare expansion, which brings a brand new single-player game.
4139504	4140185	Thank you for watching!
4155934	4158776	Hot Wheels Track Attack on Wii and DS.
4160197	4162658	Actually kind of cool because you can build your own tracks with this one.
4162758	4167260	And they have the 80s Hot Wheels orange tracks with it.
4167360	4168481	So you gotta love that.
4169701	4174364	This week also the Rock Band 3 Pro Wireless Guitar is making its way out for $150.
4174724	4176945	That's on PlayStation 3 and 360.
4177465	4182388	Silly Bands, a game based off of Rubber Bands.

4189234	4192518	Challenge Me, Brain Puzzles 2 on Nintendo DS.
4192818	4194180	That looks terrible as well.
4196662	4197984	Some re-releases, looks like.
4198464	4200146	Kind of capitalizing on Black Friday stuff.
4200686	4204070	They're re-releasing Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, and Soul Calibur 4.
4205371	4206272	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

4279275	4281556	Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 on the Wii.
4282997	4287900	And it looks like they're doing a Sonic the Hedgehog re-release pack.

4305529	4309550	Michael Jackson, The Experience Special Edition, which is on the Nintendo Wii.
4309810	4312490	That does include a jewel-encrusted white glove.
4313811	4315831	Just, you know, to complete the experience, I guess.
4315851	4318892	Which I really want Loki to wear to an episode of the show.

4322353	4349991	Cubic Zirconia that's also available on DS and PSP as well 360 and PS3 versions coming later Football Manager 2011 on PC Gran Turismo 5 coming out this week both the standard and limited edition and that wraps up the week of course it's kind of going to be slowing down here quite a bit so don't expect much coming soon
4351011	4353832	All right, well, we'll travel over to Japan and look at what's coming out of there.
4354192	4359074	On the 360, Dodonpachi Resurrection comes out in regular and limited edition.
4359114	4362375	This is from Cave, so you know where this is going, right, Loki?
4362916	4370158	It's a shooter game, but this is a, you know, it's kind of like made for the 360, so it's very pretty, kind of looking at the graphics here.
4370538	4371439	So check that out.

4396807	4400629	And yeah, it's just pretty much chicks on the beach playing pachinko games.
4400709	4402769	That is literally what this game is.
4402809	4404970	But they're all 3D rendered and shit.
4405330	4407531	Look at this 3D rendering of pachinko machines.
4407912	4413388	It almost looks like a make your own pin type of mode where you can put the pins wherever you want.
4413890	4415294	I'm telling you, it's a big deal there.
4416325	4424007	There also is a PlayStation 3 bundle with the console coming out with the Gran Turismo bundled in because it's kind of a big deal in Japan.

4431048	4433368	That's also a PlayStation 3 game.
4433408	4434389	That's coming from Koei.
4434749	4436789	And this is like a swords and magic type of game.
4437169	4444871	It kind of looks like you have a party of people, but it looks to be a little bit more of like an action-y type of role-playing game.
4445972	4446273	Yes.
4446413	4448100	Yeah, so that actually looks kind of rad.
4448140	4449886	Is this coming out in the US as well?
4449927	4450268	Sometime.
4451266	4452447	Not this year, probably next year.
4452627	4453328	Yeah, it was delayed.
4453488	4456811	That might be one that you want to import for those of you that are big in importing.
4456851	4458513	It's Trini's Souls of Zillow here.
4459073	4462076	But just be careful, it's a lot of Japanese.
4462316	4464178	So if you don't know Japanese, you might be screwed.
4464818	4468882	Mario Sports Mix this week on the Nintendo Wii in Japan.
4469182	4471424	And we got that here, or are getting it here.
4471444	4472805	I remember playing this one at E3.
4472845	4475628	That's the hockey and dodgeball and all that stuff.
4475868	4476228	Pretty soon.
4477289	4478210	That's this week in Japan.
4478470	4482012	On the Nintendo DS this week, there's quite a bit.
4482393	4483353	Some of the standouts, though.
4483733	4486395	Super Robot Taisen L comes out this week.
4486895	4493320	Reiki Taisen Getenka Tenkaishi Battle Royale comes out this week from Sega.

4497062	4501945	And Penguin no Mondai cross Tenku no 7 Senshi.
4502245	4503386	That's a price reduction, though.
4504587	4505888	And then Cooking Idol...
4506650	4510587	I, my, main, game day harimeki, kirimeki cooking
4511238	4512439	Also gets a price reduction.
4513899	4518681	I don't think these are all games that you guys are going to be pre-ordering, but lots of price reductions this week.
4519201	4522362	Lastly, on the Sony PSP, quite a few games this week.
4522983	4524583	Also, you have quite a few price reductions.
4524943	4525904	Some of the new games, though.
4526064	4528245	Miyako comes out this week from Idea Factory.
4528625	4531606	Kingdom, Iki Tosen no Ken from Konami.
4532206	4538929	And lastly, from D3, Ishin Renka, Ryuma Gaiden comes out in regular and limited editions.
4541280	4541800	Check that out.
4542500	4542841	Or don't.
4542881	4543441	See if I care.
4544241	4544761	I'm not.
4545561	4545901	Fine.
4546502	4547142	Let's go to Europe.
4547982	4551983	Well, actually, there are, of course, quite a number of games coming out next week.
4552244	4556545	We have, starting with... Excuse me.
4556865	4558806	Starting with clearing my throat so I can breathe.
4559506	4561767	The 22nd, Poker Night at the Inventory.
4563047	4565288	The 23rd, Mafia II Joe's Adventures.
4566948	4583480	on the 24th we have Crazy Taxi and Gran Turismo 5 and Pac-Man Championship Edition DX as we discussed earlier well that's the PlayStation 3 one and actually there is a release on the 25th of course it's not a holiday for them there I think
4584720	4613489	Sports Island Freedom 26 is Def Jam Rapstar Yay Disney Epic Mickey Football Manager 2011 Michael Jackson The Experience, Pac-Man Parties Sega Master Drive Classic Collection Volume 3 Tron Evolution Which I'm looking forward to So getting that And There's a bunch more There's also Venetica And on the 30th They get Super Meat Boy
4614455	4617698	Venetica is supposed to be coming over here in January, so that should be cool.
4618818	4620139	You played the daughter of the devil.
4621380	4623142	Yeah, that actually looks pretty interesting.
4623942	4628226	Because apparently death is real, or not the devil, death.
4628786	4629627	The daughter of death.
4631228	4631648	Close enough.
4632088	4632789	Both begin with D's.
4635171	4636312	That looks kind of interesting.
4636332	4638834	Yeah.
4638854	4639254	Yeah.
4641800	4644823	It does kind of have a bit of a Fable vibe to it, just in looks.
4646584	4646804	Yeah.
4647785	4648005	Cool.
4648726	4648986	That's it.
4649907	4650768	All right.
4651168	4651748	APB.
4653250	4658754	It's kind of funny because people were pissed off that this game actually kind of went under within about three months of its launch.
4659315	4666100	And now it's been acquired by Gamers First, and they're relaunching as APB Reloaded in the first half of 2011.
4667621	4673682	And what's kind of cool about it, though, is the game will actually be a free-to-play iteration of the game.
4674163	4677543	So lots of microtransactions as well.
4678023	4678944	But hey, you know what?
4678964	4682864	That's awesome because I would love that game to be free-to-play.
4683705	4687245	It was pretty fun to begin with, but I couldn't see myself paying for it.
4687625	4689566	Thank God I was too lazy to pay for it.
4692235	4695881	This was a game that you were excited about, but you were too lazy to get, right?
4696261	4696922	Exactly.
4697143	4697403	Nice.
4699046	4703813	Or as Ranma says in our chatroom, APB, rise from your grave.
4704435	4704695	Get it?
4706147	4707708	Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
4707748	4712651	We're going to get to the classic game of the week, but this is about a different type of classic on the Wii.
4712911	4717113	It's this whole super special 25th anniversary edition here.
4717934	4726759	You know, the Wii has the 25th anniversary Mario collection that comes with like a Mario collection and Wii Sports and the red controllers and all that.
4727279	4728340	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4750914	4753076	has the cement factory level.
4753836	4756038	And you might be going, okay, well, who cares about that?
4756338	4761561	Well, that's because the cement factory level wasn't in the NES version of Donkey Kong.
4762182	4768506	So it's kind of weird because it's very obvious, I guess you can tell from the way this kind of looks when you're playing the game.
4768906	4797394	that it's not a port of the arcade game but it's actually like an NES ROM but it actually has the cement factory level in it which by the way I used to call the pie level because on the Commodore 64 the little plates of cement looks like pie that for whatever reason are going into burning oil just roll with me here so yeah kind of weird that Nintendo either knowingly or unknowingly kind of dug out this prototype Donkey Kong game that honestly never saw the light of day in either continent
4798831	4800532	I think that's kind of cool, actually.
4800932	4803573	I mean, whereas a lot of people are going to look at this and go, eh, big deal.
4803813	4806775	A missing level shows up in a game that's like, what, 25 years old now.
4806815	4807896	I kind of go, wait a minute, though.
4808856	4816660	If Nintendo has this kind of shit in the vaults, and they're capable of putting it on a service like Virtual Console, why aren't they?
4819522	4827006	Like, yeah, we got some of these Japanese games that never came out here in America or Europe or whatever the case may be.
4827546	4828687	Like Sin and Punishment, right?
4828727	4831188	That was a big thing they did a couple years ago or last year.
4833035	4834517	Unreleased Nintendo Games
4852134	4859176	Why couldn't they have ported over, I don't know, the Super Nintendo cartridge that had both Super Mario World and Super Mario All-Stars?
4859196	4861177	You know, a little bit extra to go in there.
4861497	4864177	Seeing as you have a whole fucking disc that you could pack full of stuff.
4864197	4871219	Now, why would they do that when they could just put in an ad to go onto the Virtual Console Marketplace and spend 800 Wii Points on that game?
4873560	4875422	Why would they give you something for free, Loki?
4875442	4876002	Of course.
4876022	4877463	You just want something for nothing.
4877864	4878904	You want grateful kids.
4879044	4882107	What they had for the game, they had the pre-order disc.
4882127	4888211	Remember that you could get the two Nintendo 64 Zelda games and the two 8-bit Zelda games.
4889332	4893135	I don't understand why they can't just put this anthology of all these Mario games.
4893355	4896017	Oh, I know, because like you said, they're selling them on the virtual console.
4896037	4896578	That's right.
4898294	4900715	Ranma in our chatroom says it could be an unlock, lol.
4901375	4901875	I doubt it.
4901935	4902055	No.
4902535	4902996	I doubt it.
4903476	4908357	By the way, there is this 25th anniversary Super Mario Brothers thing that they did.
4909258	4914959	All they did, they like changed the copyright date and they just kind of edited the question mark blocks to say 25.
4916600	4917680	Basically, it's a ROM hack.
4919041	4925403	It's on that same level as Super Penis Brothers where somebody took all the pictures of Mario and turned them into penises.
4926536	4928277	which is freely available on the internet.
4929057	4930558	So that's the business Nintendo's in now.
4930598	4936462	Speaking of ROM hacks, I don't know if you saw and I don't think we talked about it last week New Super Mario Bros.
4936942	4941604	Someone ROM hacked the DS ROM and made it New Super Mario Bros.
4941785	4942845	I remember that coming up last week.
4944426	4945086	That's sweet.
4945307	4946867	See, that's what you do.
4947188	4948828	That's how you make these games.
4949029	4953571	Because Mario All-Stars, that's great that you made everything 16-bit and stuff.
4953791	4963997	Why don't you just update it again, make it all like new Super Mario Bros., so you have all the original levels with Mario Bros., the lost levels, Mario 2, and stuff like that.
4964157	4966538	Make it all brand new.
4966658	4967199	And guess what?
4967219	4968960	You could have sold it for $50 instead of $30.
4969020	4969100	Yeah.
4971721	4972321	Here's the thing.
4972341	4975303	Because basically you're buying a $30 ROM.
4975423	4979965	Or if they were going to do a ROM hack with this 25th anniversary, they could have done a good ROM hack.
4980005	4987588	Some of the ones out there, they took the graphics from Mario 3 when Mario looked a lot sharper and the sprites were kind of better and put it in Mario 1.
4988228	4990989	They should have done something like that where maybe they went back and redid the sprites.
4991009	4991630	But that's Mario All-Stars.
4992630	4993551	I'm not just talking about that.
4993571	4998914	I'm talking about a ROM hack out there that takes the Mario 3 sprites and puts them in the Mario 1 game.
4998954	5005317	This is just a little extra thing that they installed to your console by itself.
5005838	5008759	Oh, it's an extra bonus for buying the actual console.
5009340	5012361	It's the 25th anniversary edition of Mario Bros.
5012542	5019065	Which, by the way, the ROM will probably be floating around out there as if it really needs to be because it's just a simple ROM hack.
5019165	5019325	But...
5022046	5028948	I don't know, it's just it's neat, I guess, but it's not that unique.
5031241	5035023	Alright, well, it's a bummer that it's probably never going to go anywhere past this.
5035103	5036023	Wow, that's kind of cool.
5036343	5039045	I'm telling you, somebody just grabbed the wrong damn file.
5039305	5043366	That's probably what happened with this whole prototype getting released.
5043406	5046128	Somebody grabbed the wrong damn file and didn't even know what they were doing.
5047228	5057272	Alright, anyhow, let's get into... Speaking of classic stuff, I know we're talking about Donkey Kong, but I think DarkSakura wants to take a trip down memory lane and point out a different game.
5057292	5058013	She says, hey...
5059011	5063133	Listen up kids, you ungrateful brats that don't know what a pie factory is.
5064494	5068816	There's a game out there that you should be checking out and playing and showing a little love this week.
5068836	5073778	Although I gotta say, I think a lot of the kids know about this one, but if they forgot, it's time they remember.
5074199	5076260	I think that we should actually start this one off with the music.
5076580	5078961	I think we should too, so let me pull up the music.
5079321	5080562	If they don't get it, then...
5089423	5096425	Yes, the game of the week is Bubble Bobble, which I could have sworn I've done before, but I don't think I did, so here it is.
5097105	5099046	Bubble Bobble was put out by Taito.
5099326	5103327	It came out in 1986 and came out on damn near everything.
5103887	5105808	There are bubble dragons named Bub and Bob.
5106528	5108430	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5125545	5146656	Um, so yeah, basically, you blow the bubbles, you can trap the enemies in the bubbles, and you can push them to, uh, burst the bubbles and, you know, make the enemies fall off and, uh, the enemies can, the bubbles with the enemies and it can float so you can jump on them all for, uh, use them to get to hard to reach places or pop many of them at a time.
5147496	5171060	but if they're the last one left on the screen they get angry and change color and then you have to bop them and they're harder to get some of them have rocks, lasers, fireballs for projectiles but sometimes you have different things like water and lightning little balls that you can smack them around with
5172654	5178760	As far as ports, there have been a bajillion, like I said, and that's the technical term for it, bajillion.
5179480	5190870	There's been Commodore 64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Amiga, Atari ST, MSX, Armstrong CPC, Sharp X68000, PC, there was a DOS one in 1989, and in 1996 there was, I think, another one.
5197576	5216901	Apple II, FM, TownsMarty, Sega Master System, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, NES, Famicom Disk, Game Gear, Mobile Phone, TI-80 whatever calculators and it came out on the Ultra K Taito Arcade Classics.
5217342	5221923	There's also one for the BBC Micro that never actually got released.
5223664	5248563	Taito said in 1996 that they lost the original source code and Probe was actually sent that so that they could reproduce the mechanics and that also meant that later on there were re-releases of Rainbow Islands for Saturn, Playstation, and PC in 1996 and
5250124	5254429	The Game Boy and Game Boy Color versions have a Watermoon storyline.
5254710	5258514	It's known as Bubble Bobble and Classic Bubble Bobble.
5258854	5267263	Like I said, there was one for the TI-83 graphing calculator that someone made, which I think I had at one time until my graphing calculator died.
5268705	5273791	There was Xbox PS2, PC for the Taito Legends compilation.
5275593	5277254	It was on mobile phones in Europe and Japan.
5278376	5280138	And then it came out on the virtual console.
5280658	5282540	There were also broken versions later on.
5283562	5285384	Like ones that wouldn't let you get past level 30.
5287406	5288307	Yes, seriously.
5289361	5294466	As far as other games that came out in the series, let's move on to those.
5294526	5298030	We have Rainbow Islands, the story of Bubble Bobble 2.
5298770	5300332	We have Rainbow Islands Extraversions.
5300772	5303915	Parasol Stars, which originally came out on the PC Engine.
5303955	5306578	And I know where you can get a copy in town and they want 70 bucks for it.
5306838	5307619	And I'm like, no!
5308099	5312903	Which, by the way, if it feels like you've done this game before, it's because you did Parasol Stars in episode 315.
5312943	5314084	I did do Parasol Stars.
5314444	5315665	Parasol Stars is a great game.
5316505	5329535	And there's also Bubble Bobble Part 2, Bubble Bobble 2, slash Bubble Symphony, Bubble Memories, the story of Bubble Bobble 3, Rainbow Islands Putty's Party, which was on the Wonderswan, and I think I have it.
5329995	5330516	I have to check.
5330836	5332977	Rainbow Islands, Towering Adventure, Bubble Bobble Plus, Puzzle Bobble
5356986	5361429	Puzzle de Pon, Fairyland Story, and Check and Pop.
5361589	5361869	Similar.
5361889	5364971	Your classic game of the week, boys and girls.
5365051	5368033	Bubble Bobble on like every system ever made.
5384776	5387518	Is there a certain system that you prefer above all others?
5390240	5391961	I would say original arcade, but that's...
5392937	5401340	Yeah, well, I can tell you what my favorite in the series was and what system I played it on was Puzzle Bobble 2 on Saturn.
5402140	5405021	I played a crap ton of Puzzle Bobble 2 on the Saturn.
5405561	5406102	Seriously.
5406902	5410203	I would just sit on the floor in front of Danzel TV and just do nothing but play it.
5410783	5412464	And there's so many clones of that game now.
5412844	5413284	I know.
5413444	5414725	I have a free one on the iPhone.
5415025	5415525	Crazy stuff.
5415945	5418126	All right, that's going to do it for this part A of our show.
5418146	5419147	But don't go anywhere, guys.

5513423	5515324	at OLR on Twitter.
5515765	5517546	And we're going to get to those in just about 10 minutes.
5517606	5520528	But first, some quick news stories starting with Loki.
5521392	5531214	Rock of the Dead, the game that actually uses the guitar peripheral for something other than playing guitar, is now possibly coming to Facebook.
5531774	5541436	Apparently, Epicenter on Conspiracy's game is kind of a little bit like Typing of the Dead, except with the guitar-type controller.
5542336	5547297	And it is going to be coming, of course, in a guitar-less version sometime in 2011.
5550069	5555191	and apparently development is slated to start Q1 of next year.
5557551	5560192	They say it's a Facebook game, so what, a couple weeks after that?
5561853	5562993	So that's kind of neat, I guess.
5563013	5565734	It'd be something different to play on Facebook.
5567514	5574518	Rock Band this week has some pretty cool stuff coming out, including John Lennon's Imagine album.
5575618	5580121	So you can buy the whole album for $15 or the equivalent in points.
5581421	5585964	Or each individual song, which includes Crippled Inside.
5587125	5599041	Jealous Guy, It's So Hard, I Don't Wanna Be A Soldier's Mama, Gimme Some Truth, Oh My Love, How Do You Sleep, How, and Oh Yoko
5601189	5617747	and of course the pro guitar and bass expansions are available for looks like actually only one of the songs in that pack How Do You Sleep is the only one that has pro guitar and bass on that and then lastly what was it
5618991	5625695	Looks like Ark the Lad and Ark Arena are coming to the PlayStation Network next week.
5626676	5629757	So you can get your 8-bit gaming on there.
5630518	5642685	And it looks like Ark of the Lad 2 will be available for $5.99 while Ark Arena, I guess it was an offshoot of the series, will be purchased with Ark of the Lad 2 for $8.99.
5645008	5652805	I don't know if the other Arc Arena is going to be available separately, but that'll be coming Tuesday, November 23rd.
5656618	5658079	That's very soon, just so you know.
5658520	5659521	Yes, a couple days away.
5659781	5660782	All right.
5660882	5661703	Some of the quick stories here.
5661783	5664245	This one is about... Hold on.
5664545	5668769	I have to have an excuse to play this song because I think we've been doing this show for, what, almost nine years now?
5668809	5671472	And I don't know if I've ever had an excuse to play this song.
5674074	5674935	Let's see here.
5675295	5676256	Got to pull it up real quick.
5678758	5679199	And here we go.
5680020	5681321	We played this once in Marching Band.
5686496	5688182	That's right, it's a Monty Python story.
5689744	5693405	Yes, we've managed to find a story about video games and Monty Python.
5694305	5706229	Of course, it might not be the type of video games you're really into, but it's a UK company called Zetika, which is trying to make a social game based out of the Monty Python license.
5707049	5709710	They also have games called Buttscan.
5711131	5712271	Yes, that's right, Buttscan.
5712711	5714812	And Mr. Bean, Out of Control.
5715752	5718353	It's already being made for the iOS stuff.
5718928	5739286	So I don't know, whatever Here's a quote from the press release Monty Python is one of the most iconic comedy licenses around but there has been no new material for over 20 years By acquiring these rights we will be transporting Monty Python into the 21st century with a totally new experience for their unique comedy that will delight old and new fans alike Forget Web 2.0, this is Python 2.1 and 3 quarters
5745771	5750334	Well, you know, they did something a while back called Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time.
5750974	5751835	I do remember that.
5752015	5752495	I have it.
5752615	5752915	That's awesome.
5752955	5756678	And it had the desktop Pythonizer that turned every other sound on your keyboard into farts.
5758099	5765163	And a game called Spam, which filled your screen with a giant can of Spam and says, try to locate the can of Spam.
5767805	5768865	I love Monty Python.
5769266	5770226	Yeah.
5770326	5774169	But this game will probably be about the parrot sketch or something that's been just beaten into the ground.
5775382	5776823	Speaking of things beaten to the ground.
5776843	5778704	Are you suggesting that the parrot is dead?
5780385	5782246	This is an ex-parrot!
5783667	5787269	Anyhow, this might be an ex-MMO pretty soon.
5787629	5793312	Final Fantasy XIV has extended their free trial for yet another 30 days.
5793732	5796053	This is the second time they've done this.
5796634	5799935	And they have promised that there's a big update coming on November 25th.
5801278	5805237	So this 30 days is a thank you to the existing fan base.
5805854	5807435	For sticking with it through all this crap.
5835692	5836754	Yes, but no Auction House.
5836954	5841119	No Auction House, but Snowman and Fireworks.
5842621	5843603	Santa costume.
5843623	5844704	There's a whole thread.
5844864	5845846	Actually, now I'm curious.
5845866	5848149	I've got to look at what is coming in the November update.
5848169	5851153	There's also another update coming in December.
5853638	5856542	The update's actually just a download for Final Fantasy XI.
5856582	5857283	That's right.
5857663	5865333	They are making changes to events and battles, UI, they're changing the macro functions, some new map features.
5865853	5868116	You can now expand and collapse your map!
5868897	5870358	That sounds useful.
5870819	5874902	Also, the mouse will now scroll your map.
5875663	5877624	That also sounds very useful.
5877684	5880927	The left mouse button has been enabled for use.
5881167	5884851	Good job, Square, for making my mouse work.
5884871	5887733	Look, I realize the game was developed for a system that has no mouse.
5887793	5891316	The ability to turn left has been added to our features.
5895774	5900915	No longer will you have to sprint, but the walking functionality will be enabled.
5902196	5906777	I know there's a hardcore Final Fantasy XIV fan out there listening to this show going, you guys are assholes.
5906957	5908017	You guys are just assholes.
5908177	5909017	You don't understand.
5909037	5912338	Out of the ability to use your right leg.
5912398	5912638	Rob.
5913378	5913618	What?
5913938	5918519	That little voice that you did just sounded like Dane Cook's impersonation of himself in the womb.
5919320	5919500	Ah!
5920100	5922400	Don't you ever compare me to Dane Cook ever again.
5922560	5924141	I can't help that is what you sounded like.
5924181	5924661	Don't you ever.
5929659	5932467	Ziba in our chatroom says I still don't think they have Chocobos yet
5933288	5934369	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5963566	5964948	Loki should design an MMO.
5965108	5965708	He really should.
5966309	5967790	My MMO would be awesome.
5968251	5969752	What would your MMO be all about?
5969932	5970352	I don't know.
5970753	5971834	It'd be very freeform.
5972274	5976798	Now, we don't want to necessarily rip off of Second Life, but freeform like that.
5977038	5979681	It's like organized chaos, if you will.
5981422	5981823	I don't know.
5982443	5989009	I'd start off with a traditional MMO, and then I would take suggestions, and I would take most of those suggestions.
5990532	5991313	Alright, anyhow.
5991373	5994598	You know, random things.
5994679	5995700	Now who's interrupting who?
5995840	5996361	I'm just kidding.
5996962	5997483	You asked.
5997543	5998445	I wasn't done talking.
5998805	6000528	So technically you are interrupting me.
6000648	6001069	Alright.
6001249	6001850	Let me finish.
6001910	6002391	Let me finish.
6002431	6002611	No.
6003092	6003593	Let me finish.
6003653	6003833	No.
6004073	6004594	Let me finish.
6004654	6004875	Okay.
6005415	6005756	I'm finished.
6008806	6009627	Are you really finished?
6010088	6010228	Yeah.
6010528	6011209	God damn you.
6011850	6012311	All right.
6013733	6016877	Amaze Satsuma says, I want a turducken made out of turkey bows.
6016937	6017437	There you go.
6018018	6020061	Chocobos have now been replaced with turduckens.
6021062	6023886	And no, my MMO would not be like Bone Town.
6023926	6025027	Bone Town is lame.
6025468	6026930	My MMO is not lame.
6030894	6033197	Salacious Pop in our chat.
6033517	6037742	Chat.ArmsLunchRadio.com Quote, I'm assuming this is about the Loki MMO.
6038103	6041006	Quote, I'm a dual-spec bacon baron and titty hound.
6043630	6044811	Oh, so you're Loki's wife.
6048436	6048696	All right.
6049176	6050238	Anyhow, moving on.
6052668	6055330	Hey, more Blizzard news that isn't WoW related.
6055370	6066959	This is about Diablo and apparently there might be, there could possibly be the possibility that Diablo might maybe happen on consoles.
6068772	6071673	Here's the company's official response to speculation.
6071753	6081676	Quote, We're exploring a Diablo-related concept for consoles and are currently looking to fill a few senior console-related positions on the Diablo 3 team.
6082197	6090179	As we've said in the past, with proper care, the gameplay could suit the console platform, and we're interested in seeing what talent out there might be interested in such a project.
6090680	6097382	If you're passionate about all things Diablo and have the consequent skill and experience, then head over to our job site to check out the positions and apply.
6097842	6102406	Funny, I know someone that would be very appropriate for that.
6102946	6104788	It's a studio called Bizarre Creations.
6106169	6111514	Unfortunately, you just fired them, so yeah, it's a little awkward.
6112492	6113493	Diablo is a great idea
6130054	6133055	Please note, this is not an announcement of a console title.
6133455	6143197	We are first and foremost developing Diablo 3 for Windows and Macs, PCs, and don't intend to allow any possibility of a console interpretation to delay or affect the release of that game.
6143217	6145278	Yes, we first and foremost are developing that.
6145858	6149559	And then we're going to develop the console version, which we just announced right now.
6149759	6151859	Diablo Ghost, coming soon, everybody.
6151919	6154120	Diablo Ghost, soon on a console near you.
6155768	6156268	Check it out.
6157309	6157609	Or don't.
6158629	6161010	DarkSakura, what do you got for us before we get to Twitter topics?
6161350	6162650	Stuff and nonsense.
6163230	6166291	How about an arcade game called Let's Connect?
6168612	6174214	Basically, it was at the IAPPA... Man, that's going to be kind of a tongue twister.
6174694	6183883	Trade Show, and it uses the Kinect to play things that are like, I guess, the Nintendo's PlayChoice 10 cabinets.
6183903	6184624	You can pick your game.
6185565	6197956	And so it's not actually an official Microsoft thing, but the manufacturer, Quasimodo Interactive, needed the license to play the games publicly, so...
6199739	6202324	I don't know how well that's going to work, but it's a neat idea.
6203246	6208917	And then Kingdom Hearts 3D will have new Disney World.
6212831	6222956	They are, it's going to have, it's going to be, of course, on the 3DS and it will have Sora and Riku and they're just going to be different places.
6223096	6234641	I would say that they have to pan out, but this is, but they're going to, you know, still have the Traverse Town and all the other places still be there, but new places.
6234929	6238713	They could do a zone on Princess and the Frog and some of the new things that have come out.
6238833	6239834	Black Cauldron level.
6240115	6245621	How about, since there is a new Tron movie, I'm just saying, the Tron universe can be revisited.
6246221	6246722	I know.
6247363	6249265	The Space Paranoids level needs to be updated.
6249505	6254771	Seriously, Disney, if you want a really good primetime animated series, boom, there it is.
6256463	6257864	I'm surprised that hasn't happened, actually.
6257904	6259185	It would be awesome.
6259205	6260166	There's manga already.
6261166	6262327	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
6262367	6269932	But, I mean, seriously, you get their animation team behind it, and you could do something really awesome.
6269992	6279438	It always amazed me that at Disneyland, amongst all those acres and acres of Disney things, there's not a goddamn reference to Sora to be found anywhere in the parks or the Kingdom Hearts franchise.
6279999	6281120	It's kind of sad.
6282581	6294110	Once, one time, at the off-the-page store, the artsy store that sells the artwork and the busts and the statues and things, I saw a Sora figure, and I should have bought it then.
6294811	6295371	But I was poor.
6296392	6297633	You know what I found while we were cleaning?
6298253	6298533	Axel.
6299554	6299794	Hot.
6300135	6300555	Yeah, I know.
6301115	6311203	Because, I mean, seriously, it's a great series to get people that seem to not be interested in the characters back into those characters.
6312837	6315438	and in other news, Star Trek Online Season 3!
6316438	6317898	Yay!
6318898	6320379	Didn't Season 2 just come out?
6321119	6322439	A couple months ago.
6323399	6325160	But they've just finished up some of the new episodes.
6325340	6338342	I actually just finished the Davidian missions and it actually takes some kind of lame psychic energy stealing creatures from Next Generation and makes them actually pretty cool and badass in a very Silent Hill level sort of thing.
6338382	6338922	It was really cool.
6339082	6341603	Well, I guess that's kind of cool that they're supporting it as well as they are.
6342174	6344355	They put out the scary ones for around Halloween.
6344375	6344915	It was really neat.
6344935	6348337	Season 4 is going to be entirely in the holodeck and it's going to be set in the Wild West times.
6348357	6349578	The server's called the holodeck.
6351599	6354040	Our server's called the holodeck and the test server's called Tribble.
6355741	6358202	At any rate... Can I play on the Zachary Quinto server?
6359703	6361784	Actually, he does voices for a character right at the beginning of the game.
6363105	6364325	The emergency medical hologram.
6365486	6367047	I'll be playing that level with the lights off.
6368687	6371609	Anyway... What is your emergency...
6372486	6374449	Mission Replay, Unlockable Borg Tech
6390968	6393429	I'm laughing at what he said, not what you said.
6393949	6397011	But I'm looking forward to the mission replay because there were some pretty fun missions.
6397031	6414178	There's also going to be one thing that's not in this little piece that I was reading up on on the Star Trek Online forums is that they're going to have extra accolades and different prizes you can get for replaying older missions and making changes to some of them based on your rank and that type of thing.
6414656	6415417	So it's looking pretty good.
6415777	6419619	They've also got some sort of online shipbuilder thing, too.
6419639	6421801	And don't forget about translating your tweets into Klingon.
6423322	6424783	I'm sorry, I'm not programmed to do that.
6427204	6429626	Oh, you know what they just released, which I thought was absolutely retarded?
6429766	6431347	I mean, not even just retarded, but butt-tarded?
6432388	6437571	They released the Enterprise outfit packs, including the Vulcan chick.
6438372	6440753	I'm like, dude, that series sucked.
6441394	6442835	I did get the Seven of Nine outfit, though.
6444255	6459398	I will put pictures up on our website soon you can have 7 of 9 but I can't have they should have the evil character you can just have her outfit where everybody gets goatees the evil pack entire crew gets goatees
6460481	6461061	I like that.
6461881	6464482	Did anyone ever have a goatee in Star Trek except for him?
6465663	6466123	I don't remember.
6466143	6469684	Everyone in Star Trek was fairly clean shaven except for Riker.
6469704	6470784	The Klingons.
6471804	6475986	The old school Klingons, they all had those weird sort of goatees.
6476086	6479027	And then now most of the Klingons have uber beards.
6480187	6480707	Alright, anyhow.
6481688	6484368	Let's not turn this into a Star Trek show as much as DarkSakura would like that.
6484448	6486129	Let's go to the Twitter!
6487549	6489330	Every week you guys send us your tweets.
6491786	6492106	Twitter.com.
6516394	6518577	I guess the 10 cent deal is not the only deal out there.
6518597	6522822	I think Bioshock 1 was available for $1.99 for a day somewhere.
6523303	6524864	Probably on Steam.
6525245	6530892	See, this is the one reason I support this whole game for Windows thing is because competition, we're all going to win.
6531953	6534756	With these companies trying to undercut each other.
6534777	6535658	It's going to be awesome.
6537237	6541158	Zeebo wanted to alert us to the Final Fantasy XIV free trial being extended again.
6541258	6542459	But I already covered that.
6542479	6543559	But thanks for trying.
6544520	6544880	Let's see.
6544980	6552482	Redertainment, for whatever reason, just sent us a tweet that is a picture of Pito Bear in the TSA logo saying the U.S.
6552502	6553723	Department of Molestation.
6553823	6555643	I don't know if I find that funny.
6555663	6556904	I'm just kidding.
6556924	6557704	It's funny.
6558144	6558944	Pito Bear is always funny.
6559544	6560245	My favorite, though.
6560305	6563446	Nothing will ever top the Pito Bear on the Trader Joe's price tag.
6563466	6564066	Ha ha ha!
6564964	6566667	It was like for honey or something.
6569212	6570213	I'm sorry, it was funny.
6570634	6574901	Alright, let's see, Tigerclaw sends us a couple of stories on the tweeters.
6576431	6577752	One of this is about a really cool hack.
6577772	6579494	I'm surprised Loki didn't say anything about this yet.
6579534	6593066	But apparently it's using the Open Connect drivers, Yankeian, I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that, apparently used the Open Connect drivers and image processing to create a lightsaber effect on his PC out of a wooden stick.
6593446	6597470	And so the Kinect tracks the wooden stick and replaces it with a lightsaber.
6597490	6598591	That is awesome, sir.
6599031	6599772	You win the internet.
6601312	6613942	and yet how long is it going to take for the real lightsaber game to come out especially with all these layoffs later next year by the way there's a YouTube out there so of course I'm going to turn it on and watch this guy oh this is way better than Star Wars Kid I'm just saying
6615725	6617806	It's actually kind of awesome.
6618687	6620828	The delay on that is not as terrible as you'd think.
6621229	6623290	I mean, it's not totally fluid, but it's not horrible.
6624310	6624731	Kind of neat.
6625131	6625511	I like that.
6625651	6626672	And they're just early drivers.
6626692	6627192	They'll get better.
6628533	6631495	Again, our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
6632456	6633596	That's Orange Lounge Radio.
6633636	6633837	Get it?
6633957	6634317	OLR.
6635117	6638379	Another tweet from TigerClaw sending us this one about Pac-Man.
6638459	6641480	It's another Pac-Man story, but it's not about Pac-Man Championship Edition DX.
6641940	6643901	It is about the Rose Parade.
6644201	6652764	Yeah, Namco Bandai has said that a 55-foot tall display featuring Pac-Man and Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde is going to be one of the first.
6652805	6653725	I'm sorry, the first.
6654165	6658866	Video Game Focus Float in the 122-year-old Tournament of Roses Parade.
6659186	6661187	It's because of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary.
6661507	6669349	There's going to be a cake-toting Pac-Man surrounded by presents and standing atop a bright and colorful cornucopia of floral arrangements.
6669549	6670809	You have to remember, it's the Rose Parade.
6670849	6673190	There's tons of floral arrangements on every float.
6673690	6674710	So that's kind of cool.
6674750	6677190	And if you want to see that on TV, 8 a.m.
6677251	6679951	Pacific Time on Saturday, New Year's Day.
6680071	6680411	That's right.
6680451	6681672	You have to get up at 8 a.m.
6682072	6682872	or set your TiVo.
6683752	6687074	or just wait for the YouTube that will inevitably show up on all the gaming blogs.
6687814	6688234	There you go.
6688614	6695797	By the way, Sonic the Hedgehog was the first video game character that ever had a balloon but that was in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
6696097	6697158	That's a whole other parade.
6698038	6699819	Pikachu was also in that parade but in 2001.
6700159	6703761	And then escaped and killed everybody.
6704621	6704901	Yes, it did.
6704961	6706262	But no one wants to report on that.
6707428	6713334	Let's see, Spazinator PSN wants us to note that there is a release that didn't get mentioned earlier.
6713674	6718779	The Magic the Gathering game that is on Xbox Live Arcade is being ported to PSN this Tuesday.
6719360	6728329	And he sends a follow-up tweet saying, I recommend the Magic the Gathering PSN game for those who don't already have it on Xbox Live Arcade or like the Magic the Gathering card game.
6728689	6729089	Thanks for watching!
6750626	6752067	So I think that's going to close it for the Twitter.
6752087	6754708	I'm doing one last refresh to make sure we don't get any last minute tweets.
6754768	6755529	Nope, I don't see any.
6756549	6758070	So I hope that's not a bug or whatever.
6758110	6761172	But yeah, twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets in the future.
6762472	6764553	In the meantime, some more news stories for you guys.
6764573	6767815	Then we're going to be getting to the Skype line in a little bit at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6767895	6768215	But first, Loki.
6773059	6775501	Yes, I don't know what to think of this.
6775641	6782546	I honestly didn't play the first game, but this doesn't sound very close to the original image of Yars' Revenge.
6783307	6787630	Yars' Revenge is being remade into an anime-inspired rail shooter.
6790672	6793334	Honestly, it...
6795040	6796281	It seems like a stretch to me.
6796982	6803249	I was making the joke earlier saying that it really should have been about an angry pirate, but... Yar!
6803710	6804811	Yar is revenge!
6804831	6805352	Yar!
6805432	6806553	I will have my revenge!
6806573	6807194	Yar!
6807874	6815503	But yeah, it's supposed to be like some sort of, you know, they're saying like a Xenos saga or something like that.
6818126	6818567	I don't know.
6818847	6820029	It seems like a stretch to me.
6822091	6828420	It's kind of weird because Yars Revenge was probably one of the greatest Atari 2600 games there ever was.
6828540	6830763	Especially that it wasn't by Activision.
6831744	6832565	I've never played it.
6833346	6847671	it's it's cool but you know you play it now and you go like what there's not a lot to this what is this but you have to remember Atari 2600 games were very straightforward back in the day I mean games were four kilobytes in size back then
6848391	6850613	You write essays now that are longer than that.
6850653	6851193	You know what I mean?
6851774	6853695	They had to cram a lot into those little cartridges.
6853735	6855396	So most of the games were very straightforward.
6856918	6866225	So fine, they're reinventing it or whatever, but this whole anime chick and rail shooter doesn't seem to be at all similar to what was there before.
6867526	6872069	As long as there's some resemblance to the original game, I would approve.
6872709	6875031	But I have a bad feeling I'm not going to be seeing that.
6875772	6876012	Yeah.
6876032	6876112	Yeah.
6876977	6885719	I mean, I guess a good game's a good game no matter what they do artistically with it, but I just I think y'all can see where we're all a little apprehensive.
6887400	6887880	But we'll see.
6888400	6889781	We have yet to really see gameplay.
6890161	6893301	The only trailer that's come out so far is this weird announcement video, right?
6893942	6894142	Yes.
6894282	6898543	So we'll see when gameplay comes out.
6898783	6904404	DungeonBuster's in our chatroom saying there was more story in the manual than there was in the actual Yars Revenge game.
6904464	6905005	Very true.
6905665	6906345	Very true point.
6909235	6910616	Alright, moving on to another story.
6911556	6915418	Talk about more old games making a comeback, but this time not quite as old.
6915738	6917259	It's the Dreamcast Collection.
6917939	6918680	Yay!
6918700	6922622	The Dreamcast Collection has been listed for the Xbox 360 and the PS3.
6922702	6925043	This was caught in a listing on GameStop.
6925523	6932867	It's the Dreamcast Collection, supposed to cost $29.99, and the date that is tentative right now anyway for release is February 15th.
6933667	6939871	You shouldn't really treat these GameStop leaks as word and bond and all that because it could change.
6939971	6942713	And a lot of these are placeholders to get people to pre-order them.
6944214	6945295	But you what?
6945755	6946515	I haven't seen anything yet.
6946655	6947616	Okay.
6947756	6954380	Here's the weird thing, though, is that Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi are the only announced Dreamcast games right now.
6954821	6955942	Now, those games are going to cost $10.
6956002	6958183	Well, obviously, Sonic Adventure already came out.
6958243	6959584	Crazy Taxi, I believe, is this week.
6960625	6962927	They cost only $10 a piece to download.
6963328	6967452	So it would make no sense why you would drop $30 on this game when these two games are $20.
6968293	6974079	Unless some more XBLA and PSN ports that have not yet been announced are coming.
6974579	6981767	By the way, there were a couple that had leaked previously including Sega Bass Fishing and Space Channel 5 Part 2.
6981867	6982027	Yay!
6983528	6988171	So that could be where this is going is that maybe it will be four games in one.
6988652	6991073	Although I could really do without Sega Bass Fishing.
6991153	6994816	I'm sorry, but I'm not really into the fishing games, but whatever.
6997157	6999219	Okay, it was fun with the rod controller.
7001380	7003902	But mostly because of the fact like, ha ha, it's a rod controller.
7004062	7004963	Now I'm over it.
7005103	7007484	And then in the Japanese version it would say, fish get!
7008125	7011367	We need the game that was formerly named Daytona.
7014719	7015879	Have you seen the new one now?
7015939	7019801	It's just like they don't have the Daytona song in there so it's like Let's go with Cheap Hack
7028679	7029339	It's pretty fun.
7029359	7029820	Thank you.
7029900	7032782	SalaciousPop in our chatroom needs to have Power Stone 1 and 2.
7032902	7033323	Thanks.
7033583	7033903	Yes.
7033983	7034384	Agreed.
7034404	7035425	But weren't those Capcom games?
7036266	7036966	Yes, they were.
7037587	7040629	Probably not going to happen, but you can dream.
7040810	7043492	Remember, Power Stone Collection did come out on PSP.
7043592	7044113	Oh, that's right.
7044393	7044833	Good call.
7046375	7047636	Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7048550	7050192	I have stuff and nonsense again.
7050892	7051693	Actually, this is pretty cool.
7052374	7058119	Marvel Pinball is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in December.
7058499	7060001	Put out by Zen Studios.
7062403	7067247	It actually was leaked out because of a ratings board deal.
7067888	7069489	But it's going to be coming out.
7069950	7071131	And it will have...
7072712	7077536	all different tables that are themed after Marvel superheroes.
7077556	7085602	Like one that I'm looking at right now is an Iron Man pinball, which I don't know if it's actually patterned after the Stern Iron Man pinball.
7086182	7088164	I don't think so because that table kind of sucked.
7090065	7092607	The one based off of the movie, not for the comic.
7093147	7096550	And then they said initially four different tables will be available.
7096570	7098972	There's Blade, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and as I said...
7099572	7100052	Iron Man.
7100672	7102813	I'm taking a look at some of them right now.
7104253	7108994	And there's also supposed to be new download content coming later on.
7109374	7110654	Okay, the Blade one looks stupid.
7112275	7113135	Iron Man one looks okay.
7113695	7114955	Spider-Man one looks kind of fun.
7117076	7119816	The Wolverine one, eh, it's Wolverine.
7120457	7121077	No, it's alright.
7121097	7122397	I don't know, it could be fun.
7124795	7125976	I'm kind of picky on my pinball.
7126157	7126797	I'll check it out.
7127098	7128840	I think Pinball FX 2 is pretty awesome.
7129160	7129941	Yeah, we've got it.
7130982	7131382	Good times.
7132043	7132223	Yes.
7132484	7132984	It's free.
7133104	7134666	Everybody should go get it if you don't already have it.
7134886	7135387	I know, right?
7135867	7138791	And especially if you had the first game, it automatically imports all the tables.
7139311	7140893	I think I talked about this last week or the week before.
7141093	7141294	You did.
7141734	7141934	I did.
7142235	7142395	Yes.
7143596	7145477	Well, it's not a big surprise.
7146198	7151521	Rumors that the PSP2 prototype, they have leaked images of it.
7152382	7167331	And it's actually been confirmed by some developers saying that the photos are legitimate, but that it's a dev kit and that the hardware will probably change the way it looks by the time the system comes out.
7167731	7170172	But some of the features that were noticed in the pictures.
7171072	7178594	It's got a front-facing camera, microphone, finally two analog sticks, which is awesome.
7178994	7185856	Also has a back-facing camera and the rumored trackpad, which is on the back of the device.
7186856	7188296	That seems awfully weird to me.
7189057	7193138	Unless somehow the screen flips over where you can use the trackpad on the front.
7193618	7194098	But, um...
7196761	7197562	Neat, I guess.
7198862	7214091	The prototype right now looks very similar to the PSP Go, but they're saying that it's possible that they may make either they're going to have two different models, one that resembles the PSP 3000 and one the PSP Go, or it's going to be just the PSP Go.
7214332	7216733	Also, it will not have a UMD drive.
7216953	7221396	Instead, it will be using some sort of memory sticks.
7223115	7228139	Interesting, so they are saying there's going to be a physical media, but it's just not going to be these disks anymore.
7228959	7229219	Yeah.
7230640	7237305	Let me be the first to say that if it's going to be memory sticks that this thing's going to be using, this will be cracked so fast, it's not even funny.
7237405	7237945	Yeah, wow.
7238086	7243729	Because if it's on a physical device like that, why even bother?
7243910	7247012	I know, that's kind of a scary thought on their side, so...
7247543	7252686	But not a lot of other new things about what could be on the system besides the whole trackpad thing.
7252866	7259750	I mean, you know, the new DS is going all 3D and stuff.
7259790	7264172	Well, the top screen looks like it's supposed to be an HD screen.
7264192	7267474	They're saying that the graphics are going to be comparable to the Xbox 360.
7267534	7270596	Ah, interesting.
7270796	7271396	So, let's see.
7273041	7281728	All right, well, I'm sure we'll be hearing plenty more about that at E3 because it really is hard to say that this is not at least somewhat true at this point.
7281948	7282169	Yeah.
7282649	7284450	Anyhow, we got about six months to go before E3.
7285599	7290481	Something that's coming out a lot sooner if you want to get a new console is the OnLive Micro Console.
7290862	7293823	It is coming out December 2nd and it costs $99.
7293943	7297545	This is the whole little console for you to use OnLive on your TV.
7298185	7301447	And yeah, when they say micro console, like this thing's, it's small.
7301787	7307609	I mean, it's basically a miniature PC that will just do all the connecting to the internet and the whole cloud gaming thing.
7308110	7309110	Oh, yeah.
7309130	7309790	Strange little thing.
7309931	7313712	They've already got those internet TV devices like at Fry's.
7313732	7315073	So I imagine it's the same deal.
7316094	7325601	All it is is it just serves the sole function of connecting to the online services and using whatever technology it does to deliver the video just quickly to your TV.
7326081	7327722	So, kind of cool.
7328743	7335188	By the way, they are saying that you will only be able to get this, though, on the OnLive website until next year.
7335228	7337189	And it's only going to be in limited quantities.
7337249	7340692	So if you think you might want one of these, you've got to act really soon.
7341332	7341632	DarkSakura.com
7366370	7386165	and nobody was really paying for it yet anyway because it was all like sponsored right now but yeah that is all going out the window which is which is good more information on the full pricing in the lineup will be coming out in December that's according to the CEO Steve Prolam in December we'll announce pricing in the lineup of games it's literally just a matter of getting publishers to sign this and that and the other thing
7386625	7388107	So, very cool.
7388187	7394453	They eliminated the monthly subscription fee after they kind of polled the user base and looked there and saw what users really wanted.
7394493	7396656	That's cool that they're listening to that.
7396876	7397576	That's smart.
7400200	7406124	Also, there could be some new platforms that come to this as well and possibly exclusive games.
7407084	7409686	The company is trying to get some big name releases as well.
7409746	7416450	Duke Nukem Forever, Deus Ex Human Revolution, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Red Faction Armageddon, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Fear 3.
7417330	7418871	Driver, and so on and so on and so on.
7419032	7421174	All those types of games they're trying to get as well.
7421594	7427379	What's also interesting is that they're looking at iOS versions of the client software.
7427760	7431843	So on live on your iPhone... That won't work very well.
7431863	7433525	I don't know how that would work without...
7434205	7441793	Better controls, but I guess it might not be too far out of the realm of possibility.
7441834	7444897	I mean, if Netflix and all that's on there, somebody wants to put games on there.
7444917	7446579	Yeah, but Netflix, I don't have the control with, you know.
7446639	7448861	I know, I get that, I get that, but who knows?
7448961	7449762	Who knows what could happen?
7450383	7450963	So, there you go.
7452224	7469419	uh by the way Apple TV they've also uh been toying with the idea of in Google TV but they say Apple TV may not work because it runs at 720p and 30 frames a second you'll never get above 30 frames a second and you can't really get the 720p so uh who knows
7470976	7473758	Anyhow, let's move on and open up the old mailbag.
7473838	7477261	Every week, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst.
7477381	7484687	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and she pulls out some of her favorite emails and reads them for us live on air.
7484767	7487069	But I don't know if there were a lot of pickings this week, were there?
7487189	7493795	No, there weren't, but I did get a reply from the one who got the wrong name.
7494675	7497678	And because he was so nice about it, he's our winner.
7499412	7501373	Aww, what a nice gesture.
7502214	7502554	Mike!
7504075	7509778	Congratulations, you've won a Castlevania Symphony of the Night Xbox Live Arcade code.
7510018	7510498	Yay!
7510958	7511518	Enjoy!
7511719	7512999	Free stuff is always good.
7513539	7514520	Yep, very nice.
7515420	7515841	So that's it.
7516881	7517921	That was it for the emails, really?
7518081	7520502	We didn't get any questions or nothing?
7521042	7521242	No.
7521782	7526243	Dear Orange Jones Radio, why is DarkSakura so cool?
7526923	7528164	I don't know, listener.
7529184	7530044	I think it's in her DNA.
7530064	7532485	I'm reading over your shoulder and that says, such a bitch.
7532825	7534005	I think you changed.
7536325	7537306	Rob got potholdered.
7538286	7540146	At least it wasn't flaming hot potholder.
7540506	7540806	All right.
7541647	7542807	Well, that was mailbag fail.
7543647	7544208	Fail!
7544368	7545449	Fill it up for next week.
7545549	7549113	Every one of you needs to send an email and then we'll get Rob to read them.
7549133	7551375	DarkSakura's gonna have to read 50 emails next week.
7551455	7553277	We'll get our special guest to read them next week.
7554218	7555380	Do we have a special guest next week?
7555520	7556701	You know who our special guest is?
7557462	7557942	Marissa!
7557962	7558363	I'm so excited.
7559144	7560085	I'm so excited.
7560125	7562007	And we'll have to have her do Uta's brassieres.
7562027	7565010	We need a pile of emails bigger than her boobies.
7565621	7566461	That's a lot of emails.
7566481	7567862	That's a lot of emails.
7568022	7568582	Get starting.
7569483	7570063	Get cracking.
7570883	7572304	Marissa's rack is quite mighty.
7572824	7573124	All right.
7573524	7577046	Well, in the absence of emails, there's always time for FUs.
7593687	7598608	Um, F you to the sudden realization of my unemployment.
7599508	7600489	I hated that place.
7601349	7604209	A lot of the people I worked with, well okay, a lot of them pissed me off too.
7604990	7608890	But, it's sort of the uncertainty side of things.
7608930	7609771	What am I going to do now?
7609811	7610851	I'm not having insurance.
7611851	7612791	But I get to finish school.
7613912	7615792	I can sleep in as much as I want to.
7617461	7618521	and I'm getting my Severance Shack.
7619402	7623423	So it's not a big loss, but still kind of melancholy, you know what I mean?
7625064	7628005	It's a weird in-between place, kind of be.
7628605	7634907	And also, I want frozen yogurt a lot, so I feed me not having any, even though I do have pumpkin ice cream.
7635027	7635827	OMG.
7636427	7637628	I want pink berries so bad.
7637728	7638348	Pink berry!
7638588	7639188	Pink berry!
7640109	7640569	Let's go!
7640929	7641349	Bye, show!
7641369	7643070	Seriously, I have pumpkin pink berry right now.
7643090	7643630	It's not good.
7645231	7646111	It's not terrible, though.
7646312	7646992	But it's not good.
7647092	7648373	But it's pumping.
7648473	7648873	Hardly.
7649674	7650895	It's more like Tarkin.
7651195	7651575	Whatever.
7651976	7652316	All right.
7652736	7653056	Loki!
7655398	7661082	I guess F you to, I don't know, lack of sleep, I guess.
7661902	7664664	You don't have to get up early every day.
7664945	7665485	It sucks.
7666666	7668147	I hate waking up at four in the morning.
7669853	7670693	and CP on the couch.
7672854	7675915	Well, it'll only be for hopefully a few more months.
7676316	7676576	Oh no.
7676796	7678436	Or maybe another year or two or three.
7678536	7678776	Oh no.
7679397	7679997	A few more years.
7680637	7681297	Look forward to it.
7682218	7682858	Good times.
7682878	7686359	A few more years and then the random crawling into bed and getting kicked in the head.
7687200	7687860	That happens too.
7688360	7691601	And then when he's like 15 or 16 he's going to start fighting with you every day.
7691641	7694142	And then your friends who don't have children have to hear about it.
7696718	7698399	or your entire internet radio audience.
7698439	7698939	That'll be fun.
7699099	7702801	I'm also sending major hearts to Becky right now.
7702941	7711045	My FU of the week goes to all the sand that somehow lodged itself in my vagina earlier this week because, dang, there was a lot of it.
7711085	7712546	No, I had a really, like, crap week.
7713046	7714127	But things got better.
7714187	7714827	They always do.
7715307	7716408	It gets better, guys.
7720097	7720717	That's really it.
7720777	7728322	Otherwise, I'm just looking forward to getting the week of... Lady, you know we're doing a show, right?
7728562	7728842	Yeah.
7730123	7733305	But I want Dan to give an FU because Dan's FUs are amazing.
7734485	7735346	Okay, George can do one.
7736146	7736707	An FU?
7738548	7739628	FU of the week, duh.
7740329	7742370	Aren't you mad at something that you want to say FU to?
7743230	7744411	Jamie loves to put people on the spot.
7744451	7745252	I know, I love doing it.
7745272	7745472	George!
7751707	7752207	What's that, George?
7752487	7752848	Hi, George.
7753348	7753628	Hello.
7753848	7754188	Hello.
7754529	7754729	Hi.
7755049	7757991	I'm normally mad at everything, but I'm not mad at anything this week.
7758031	7759431	Well, F you for being so happy.
7760632	7761813	Damn you and your happiness.
7761993	7762893	So I gave you one.
7763414	7764894	That's awesome.
7766195	7766495	All right.
7767416	7767996	Poor George.
7768016	7770337	That's when people come over to my house, they get to be on the show.
7771058	7773079	You come over to my house, you're going to be talent on my show.
7773679	7774120	Get in here.
7774540	7776761	Nobody gets off this stage unless they sing the blues.
7779341	7780802	You know where that came from, right?
7781183	7782364	Adventures in babysitting?
7782404	7790551	Just a couple more stories and we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR Hey, oh, I don't know if I like this.
7791311	7792812	Jamie, get ready to rage.
7792872	7793193	What?
7793393	7794734	Jeremy Todd won in our chat room.
7795254	7797416	F you to Jamie for fucking up the F yous of the week.
7799578	7800079	You know what?
7802060	7805163	Don't say that to somebody with ops because I will kick your ass.
7805863	7806324	Literally.
7808473	7809574	Oh, no.
7810055	7811176	Oh, no, he didn't.
7811316	7811616	All right.
7813097	7813318	Yes.
7813858	7815039	Oh, he says F you to myself.
7816020	7816280	All right.
7816300	7818503	I don't care.
7818983	7819544	All right, Loki.
7819584	7819824	Come on.
7819844	7820284	Let's move on.
7821365	7823267	Portal 2 has been delayed again.
7823687	7824008	Yeah.
7824368	7826310	It wasn't going to come out when they said it.
7826370	7827191	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
7827591	7829313	You mean Valve delayed a game?
7829333	7830834	What?
7830934	7831295	What?
7832911	7833792	and this is news.
7834433	7835114	That's alright though.
7835134	7836556	Let's just put an extra polish on it.
7837217	7838819	It's been delayed to April 20th, 2011.
7838859	7841663	The day after my birthday!
7842464	7843526	People, you know what to do.
7844006	7845529	It's the day after your birthday.
7845569	7846270	You're screwed.
7846710	7847631	My birthday lasts all week.
7849418	7853902	It was originally planned for holiday 2010 and delayed to February 9th, 2011.
7856084	7857345	So now it's April.
7857745	7859687	I kind of always thought it was going to be April anyways.
7860207	7861048	I thought that's what it was.
7861148	7864031	I didn't realize it was actually February was the release date for that.
7864091	7864871	But yeah, whatever.
7864891	7865432	It's April now.
7865592	7866553	So get over it.
7869600	7869920	All right.
7870281	7871602	Just in time for Jamie's birthday.
7871642	7872962	What about my birthday?
7872983	7875324	What are you going to get me for my birthday, Valve?
7875845	7876585	I'll give you a dollar.
7877466	7878226	You're not Valve.
7878867	7879607	I'll give you a Valve.
7881368	7882269	I'm sure we got a couple.
7883210	7883510	All right.
7884030	7886952	File this last story of our night under what?
7887533	7888574	And huh?
7889734	7889915	Yeah.
7890255	7892296	This is a comment from Bobby Kotick.
7892396	7895258	I don't know why whatever this guy says makes news, but I don't know.
7895459	7896940	You love to hate him or you hate to love him.
7897000	7897300	I don't know.
7897972	7899313	Very interesting comic, though.
7899613	7900033	Comic?
7901014	7901795	Freudian slip, maybe?
7901815	7902095	I don't know.
7902555	7905457	Very interesting comment from Mr. Kotek, though.
7905837	7907598	It's about the online pass thing.
7907678	7911701	You know, EA, THQ, $10 online play if you buy the game used.
7913162	7918005	Quote from Bobby Kotek, quote, We can do some of these things EAs and others have done.
7918486	7923149	We actually don't think it's in the best interest of the gamer, and so we've chosen not to.
7924284	7950484	from a financial perspective you look at it and say okay well the retailer is not paying us anything for the privilege of doing it and you know we invest all this capital in making a game we're not getting any credit any return on their resale of the game but you know something the best way to keep people engaged in your game experience is to keep giving them more great content I think you always need to be sensitive to that relationship and not crossing the line to a place where the customer feels like they have been taken advantage of
7951605	7959109	So that's why they would rather put out $15 map packs for their games than an online pass.
7960010	7960710	You know what, though?
7961931	7963472	I'm actually kind of okay with that.
7966539	7970560	I mean, it would be better if it was cheaper, but at least it's more content.
7971040	7983782	But the only thing, here's what I don't like, is that when that additional content is stuff that is necessary to the game, and what I really hate is when that content is already on the disc.
7984102	7985963	Because that is not downloadable content.
7985983	7987723	Download to unlock.
7987843	7989683	I haven't gone on this rant in years.
7990003	7991584	That is not downloadable content.
7991604	7992864	That is pay to unlock content.
7993884	7995545	and that's what we should be referring to it as.
7996225	7998906	When you're paying to unlock content that's already on your desk.
7999366	8004127	Like Beautiful Katamari on the 360 had plenty of pay to unlock content.
8005247	8005667	There it is.
8007468	8010069	Alright, that's going to do it for our news stories tonight.
8010929	8012289	We're going to open up the Skype line now.
8012329	8014510	I should probably take us off Do Not Disturb in order to do that.
8014870	8018791	Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype or you can give us a call on the old Telefono.
8019565	8029110	877-GAME-OLR is our phone number, and you can give that a call.
8030211	8038896	In the meantime, I don't know if Loki has any last-minute stories tonight, but do you have anything last-minute for us, Loki?
8042352	8047636	Yeah, apparently there's going to be a new cheat tool coming to the PlayStation 3 from Code Freak.
8048557	8058045	Apparently the people behind the Code Freak tool, Cyber Gadget, have announced a new device coming to the PS3 in Japan.
8059886	8064110	It's a walkthrough tool, as they call it, and it's going to cost 7,800 yen.
8064270	8066992	It'll come with cheats for 50 titles.
8068473	8071076	And they say more codes can be downloaded via PC.
8074020	8074881	I don't know.
8075141	8076682	It sounds like modified saves almost.
8080365	8081246	Shall we go to the phones?
8082267	8083188	Yes, let's.
8083208	8084269	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8084289	8084629	Who's this?
8085249	8086130	Hey, this is X-Link.
8086150	8086951	Hi, X-Link.
8087651	8089113	I decided to beat out Rama for one week.
8089253	8089633	That's alright.
8089673	8091495	Long time listener, first time caller, right?
8092235	8092776	As always.
8093096	8094117	What's on your mind?
8094617	8095658	I have a question for you.
8095738	8099661	How the hell can you dog Age of Empire 3 but yet you will play Civilization?
8100782	8101623	Because I'm a hypocrite.
8105680	8107001	I'm just kind of curious.
8107061	8118866	I was like, wait a minute, you're sitting there saying Age of Empires is not worth the 10 cents, but yet you would play Powers on End, Civilization V. Because I have a very simple answer for you.
8119027	8122588	It's just going to blow your mind, my simple answer for all of this, X-Link.
8123249	8124849	It's amazing I can't solve world peace.
8124869	8125190	You ready?
8125830	8126050	Yes.
8126390	8133294	The reason why I don't want to pay 10 cents for Age of Empires III is because I have Civilization V. I don't need anything else.
8134110	8134730	Oh, that's true.
8134750	8136051	I kind of agree with you on that.
8136151	8140893	Unfortunately, I don't have Civilization 5, so I have to go with the next best thing right now.
8159401	8162822	You rarely see current games going on sale on Steam.
8162882	8166462	Although, to be fair, Steam does manage to get some of those really good deals.
8166502	8170063	Like, you know, when they were putting Torchlight on sale for like half its price.
8170083	8172403	They've done some deals with Poker Night, which isn't even out yet.
8172824	8173384	So, you know.
8174304	8178745	Which I'm looking forward to that because that supposedly is going to be coming out Tuesday.
8178825	8180685	So, I'm definitely looking forward to that.
8180705	8181685	I think it's actually tomorrow.
8182365	8182925	Is it tomorrow?
8183186	8183646	I think so.
8183826	8184806	Okay, maybe it's tomorrow.
8185046	8185386	There it is.
8186215	8186715	Well, there we go.
8187056	8189858	Jeremy Todd 1 in our chatroom says, but it's only 10 cents.
8190278	8194461	I bought it six different times just so I can has more AOE3 than you.
8197043	8198544	Now that's showing your support.
8200545	8200926	Wow.
8202647	8206710	Yeah, but, you know, again, competition, never a bad thing.
8206770	8208571	I'm really excited for Black Friday.
8208771	8209332	Oh, my gosh.
8209352	8211053	We're going to get some steel games.
8211073	8212334	That's a really good deal, though.
8212634	8213074	10 cents.
8213114	8214956	You can't really... You really...
8215777	8217700	Don't really want to pass that up for even a game.
8217760	8220905	I mean, even if you don't get a gift for somebody else, you know, 10 cents.
8221666	8222207	We'll see.
8222427	8222908	We'll see.
8224210	8227394	It sounds like almost like we're doing one of those info commercials for those children, you know.
8227454	8228155	I know, right?
8228276	8230539	It's just the price of a cup of coffee a day.
8232166	8233007	Precisely.
8233148	8234349	But, you know, I saw that.
8234409	8235310	I was amazed by that.
8235370	8237172	I'm like, a $40 game, 10 cents.
8237632	8244400	Well, it was $40 back in 2005, but I guarantee you that game is in, like, $3 bargain bins at Best Buys everywhere.
8244720	8245221	You know what I mean?
8245241	8247443	Probably, but according to their website, it was still at $40.
8247783	8250206	Well, of course, because it's a Microsoft game.
8250246	8251808	They don't want to admit that it's, you know...
8252253	8254515	Yes, they officially haven't dropped the price of it.
8254955	8258577	Does not mean everybody else hasn't to try to clear out inventory.
8258758	8259918	That's right.
8260699	8267504	Speaking of Microsoft and things like that, I'm actually looking forward to this whole Dungeon Siege 3, even though technically it's what, Squeenix doing it now?
8267964	8269425	Microsoft have done the first couple games?
8270105	8270946	I'm looking forward to that.
8272187	8273388	That should be very interesting.
8273428	8277591	Hopefully they don't bastardize it like Final Fantasy 14.
8277631	8280693	Well, it's not like an online MMO type of thing, so...
8281454	8282275	Don't feel too bad.
8282355	8284216	I was right with you with the whole raid thing.
8284236	8284616	Remember?
8284656	8287778	Because, unfortunately, my account, I was stupid and let it lapse.
8287858	8289499	So I wasn't there during that whole time.
8289659	8293501	Yeah, we're not able to take phone calls during Horde House, so I know you couldn't really chime in on this.
8293541	8294042	But, yeah, I know.
8294222	8295022	We both missed it.
8295062	8298124	So at least, you know, at least you don't have to feel all alone.
8298144	8300886	Like, I'm the only one who didn't get it because of my build thing.
8300966	8301906	No, I'm right there with you.
8301926	8302867	All in due time, my friend.
8302907	8303668	All in due time.
8304028	8304428	Yeah, I know.
8304468	8305409	We'll get it eventually.
8305469	8306449	We just might be level 81 or 82.
8306549	8307850	But, hey, it'll work out.
8311452	8312493	We should be geared for it.
8312833	8313893	Cataclysm happening soon.
8314174	8318976	The rumor on the street is that the world is coming to an end on Tuesday in World of Warcraft.
8319556	8321978	It's the end of the world as we know it.
8322578	8322798	Yeah.
8322818	8323558	But I feel fine.
8323739	8326500	Doing a lot of odds and ends and disconnects.
8326800	8329201	Going to be more glorious than ever, so yes.
8329482	8331042	So we all look forward to that.
8331122	8333804	Now you started playing WoW with Wrath of the Lich King, right?
8334564	8337866	So are you looking forward to your first proper expansion rolling out?
8339446	8340847	No, because I don't have the money for it.
8341747	8342027	Aww.
8342768	8344188	Well, you know what the good news is, though?
8344769	8349231	You won't be competing with everyone else trying to level in those zones and everything because it's going to be a shit show.
8349511	8351092	I was going to do that anyway.
8351112	8356514	To be quite honest, my first goal when that was going to come out was going to be the Archeology to get that to 450.
8357035	8357495	Gotcha.
8357855	8358215	Gotcha.
8358855	8359236	All right.
8359776	8364038	Well, anyway, the other hosts are going to start glaring at me if I fill up the show with Warcraft chat, so...
8365405	8367847	My eyes closed over and my brain went foggy.
8367987	8368528	Exactly.
8368808	8370830	So that's why they made me take it to a separate show.
8371131	8371411	All right.
8371811	8372412	Have a good one.
8372432	8373813	Have a good one, X-Link.
8373914	8374494	Thanks for calling.
8374534	8374794	Okay.
8375135	8377497	Anytime.
8377517	8378118	Bye-bye.
8378138	8382202	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8383143	8383824	Give us a call.
8383844	8384385	We'll talk.
8384925	8386387	Meanwhile, do we have any other last-minute stories?
8386467	8387568	Mr. Loki over there?
8389864	8392346	Well, good, because we have other calls coming in, so we might as well go to those calls.
8392686	8393567	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8393587	8393927	Who's this?
8394547	8395288	Hey, it's Ranma.
8395308	8396609	This time my Skype works.
8396849	8398430	Long-time listener, first-time caller, right?
8398671	8399131	Hi.
8399151	8399691	Yeah, right.
8400192	8400972	What's on your mind, buddy?
8401953	8402273	Hey.
8404034	8405556	Now, this is something I wanted to talk about.
8405576	8407277	Unfortunately, I wasn't able to last week, but
8409245	8413969	This is the whole music game genre with rock band and guitar hero.
8414169	8416311	Now, let me ask you guys.
8416751	8423076	Do you see it like really dying dead like DDR or something else?
8424349	8426830	DDR hasn't exactly fallen over dead, though.
8426930	8428151	Like, I get what you're saying.
8428511	8431572	DDR is not what it was to you and me ten years ago.
8431932	8434594	But they did just release a game two weeks ago.
8435254	8441537	So I don't see any reason why they won't continue to release rock band style plastic guitar and drum games ten years from now.
8442037	8447039	But it's not going to be what it was in its heyday when rock band and all this stuff first came out.
8448140	8448440	Okay.
8448720	8450161	Because the way I see it is this.
8450821	8452222	Konami throws us DDR.
8452402	8452922	Yay!
8452942	8452982	Oh.
8453612	8454272	Here's another one.
8454513	8455033	Yay!
8455353	8455994	Here's another one.
8456254	8456874	Wait, yeah, wait.
8457254	8457695	What is this?
8458435	8459676	Yeah, Konami, yo, we gots to talk.
8459796	8460457	What is this?
8460717	8461037	Drop.
8461757	8465140	Whereas with Rock Band and Guitar Hero, here you go.
8465500	8466180	Yay!
8466741	8468782	Here you go, plus we threw in some more stuff.
8469082	8469523	Sweet.
8470339	8471439	Here's another game.
8471499	8473160	This time, we'll give you more stuff.
8473700	8474200	Sweet.
8475220	8476340	That's the way I see it.
8476740	8485442	And having an interesting discussion with a couple of people on Twitter about this, who think that the whole gaming, rhythm gaming is falling apart due to lack of sales.
8486282	8494623	I honestly believe lack of sales come from the fact of it's too damn expensive because of the pricing of the bundles and all the other accessories, more or less.
8495163	8497184	Right about now in this economy, who has 180 bucks?
8498624	8527183	and what I would tell your friends on Twitter is again the sales of Dance Central sort of kind of counters that argument that music games are just dead in the water music games are just evolving plastic guitar and plastic drum games are on their way out that is what these studies are showing what has the music genre been focused on for the past few years what has the media been focused on for the past few years it's all about these plastic guitar games alright their time is coming to an end let's bring on the next big thing in music gaming it's out there somewhere
8528311	8528911	Thanks for watching!
8550865	8579499	and they opted out on doing bundles with all that stuff because they need to have 80,000 bundles in the stores and it would confuse people yeah most retailers though are kind of smart and they put the plastic guitars right next to the game you know what I mean exactly and I explained that to him but he still took me maybe like three days to explain to him they're not bundling it because it's a different company making the accessories if you want the pro guitar that badly just be like everybody else pre-order go down there and whoop somebody's ass to get one hmm
8581169	8581590	Interesting.
8581630	8584333	I wonder if just all this saturation is partially to blame.
8584373	8587497	Well, as we went into a couple weeks ago on the show, it kind of is.
8587978	8593225	I think Guitar Hero in some ways is to blame for Rock Band's tumble.
8594607	8595107	But I don't know.
8595227	8595608	You know what?
8595788	8597250	We still have All Christmas to get through.
8597290	8599152	I think they'll still sell more copies of Rock Band 3.
8600798	8611770	I tend to think so too, and you know, not for nothing, I did pick up Rock Band, the Beatles' Rock Band, but I can understand why the game didn't do so well, and the same thing with Green Day Rock Band, because it's simple.
8612411	8618597	Most of today's generations probably had never heard of the Beatles, you know, I guarantee you.
8618897	8621020	I guess it's just me being biased, but if it was...
8622594	8651284	Rock Band, Bon Jovi I think we would have done at least two to three times the normal sales because everybody's heard of Bon Jovi but hate me if you want that's not really a game I'd be interested in you know what I mean that's the problem with these games no matter what no matter who the band is that they pick because I'll sit here and go but give me Rock Band Journey and oh my god but I realize it's still not going to sell any better you know I think you take the Beatles they are the biggest selling band of all time whether they are anymore or whatever
8652024	8658709	It's just one of those, you know what, a game so focused on one band is never going to appeal to a mass market.
8658729	8666454	But Rob, if they gave you the choice, if they said, okay, hey, we're going to release Rock Band Journey as a standalone game, or you can download all the songs.
8667635	8668756	You probably download all the songs.
8670317	8676722	I would like it better if I could download all the songs and a Journey-themed background or something.
8677642	8678303	You know what I mean?
8678343	8682346	Something to add into the Rock Band experience, which I'm kind of surprised they haven't done.
8682606	8684668	You have all these trackpacks or whatever.
8685028	8689331	Why not have a No Doubt-themed arena to go with the CD or something like that?
8689411	8689892	Thanks for watching!
8713369	8726940	you're right about that you wouldn't buy the game but the way I see it is this out of like 10 people maybe 8 people would buy the Bon Jovi game compared to maybe like 6 would buy the Journey themed game you see what I'm saying?
8727440	8738429	Go with a band that more people probably would buy because it's a given 100% is not going to buy a band themed game because not everybody is behind them you know?
8738929	8745438	Here's the thing though is I think there are very very very few and I know I've gotten into this on the show before so you've probably heard this before.
8745898	8753949	There are very very few bands and artists that can justify an entire release for their brand and
8754669	8756810	and the Beatles were certainly one of them.
8758810	8760051	Michael Jackson is another.
8760751	8763792	And there's probably nobody else in that top tier, to be honest.
8764012	8769434	I don't think there is any other band or musical act that fits into that same caliber as Michael Jackson and the Beatles.
8769654	8769854	None.
8770994	8780340	Now you go down to the next tier and that's where you get your Bon Jovis and your Van Halens and your Aerosmith and Metallica.
8781501	8783643	But I don't even think Green Day fits into that tier.
8784323	8788826	Honestly, I was too fond of Green Day being in that tier and that tier above it.
8788906	8789547	I don't even think...
8790447	8794590	Aerosmith was more deserving than Metallica if you ask me, but that's just my opinion.
8794770	8802574	Right, and then it starts to get into opinions, but you just have to kind of look at history, record sales, how many t-shirts with the band's name have been sold.
8803355	8806317	I think Metallica and Aerosmith are about even, it's just different crowds.
8807337	8807818	Pretty much.
8808898	8814101	But I think that very, very top tier, there's nobody in it but the Beatles and Michael Jackson.
8814221	8816342	Nobody has that same kind of pull.
8817022	8818443	And now we see what we're getting.
8818483	8822645	I mean, Michael Jackson just never really worked right for a rock band kind of setup.
8823065	8829869	So now we see what we're getting instead, which I don't know if it's the best idea, but I won't see for real until I get to play the game.
8830169	8830769	I'm interested.
8831290	8836152	I gotta say, I find the idea of a Michael Jackson dance-y type Just Dance game interesting.
8836552	8838753	more appealing than some of the other dance games I've seen?
8840353	8842213	Well, I mean, I've seen people play.
8842253	8843073	I think it's pretty fun.
8843113	8849335	Me personally, if I'm going to sit there and play it, I'm going to get the official loafers and the glove and the jacket and just rock out with my cock out.
8850055	8851115	Hey, hold on there.
8851155	8852415	Michael Jackson got in trouble for that.
8853395	8855036	Yeah, but I'm an adult, so it's okay.
8855636	8857476	Alright, we've got to let you go, buddy.
8857936	8859056	But I appreciate the discussion.
8859096	8859457	It was good.
8859677	8860257	Have a good one, buddy.
8860857	8861177	You too.
8861257	8861457	Later.
8864097	8867200	1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lawns Radio.
8867240	8869643	Giovedea says, I want Billy Joel for Rock Band.
8869923	8871044	Hey, good news, Giovedea.
8871204	8875008	They're going to do like this huge Billy Joel track pack, keyboards and all.
8875549	8880614	I believe December-ish, early December-ish is when it's coming.
8881074	8882976	And I'm talking like it's like 10 songs.
8883176	8885559	So that should be very exciting, correct?
8886379	8886700	I don't know.
8888092	8892576	Should we go to more calls or last-minute stories, or what are we going to do here?
8892596	8895178	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8895198	8896759	You want to throw out a last-minute story real quick, Loki?
8896779	8899081	Yeah, sure, let's do that.
8900042	8901903	Okay, I'm trying to think.
8902023	8903605	Oh, this is kind of cool.
8903625	8904525	I saw this, actually.
8905686	8907888	You know that game, Super Mario Crossover?
8908268	8913373	Well, of course, they're doing another update for it, and they're adding the Blaster Master vehicle as...
8914236	8940286	One of the characters you can play as Somebody tweeted that to us this week I saw that, that's cool Yes, very very cool That update is not yet live but it will be coming soon though I actually played a little bit of that game before the show with the last update Ryu from Ninja Gaiden Very cool Hold on, our phones are lighting up all at once now Let me go take some calls Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8941640	8942920	Hi, this is Spazinator.
8942960	8944261	Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind, buddy?
8945701	8949503	Yeah, a couple things that I did get around to tweeting to you.
8952423	8953904	They're all kind of interrelated.
8955844	8969449	First off, right off the top of my list, for those of us that have access to a PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Network, there's another free anime episode currently on the store.
8969889	8970449	It's called
8973310	8980134	Hey, let me ask you this.
8980394	8983475	How do you keep tabs on all this free stuff that's coming out?
8983535	8986537	Is this you just checking the store every Wednesday when they do the updates?
8986557	8990499	Or is there a blog that tracks all the free shit on PSN?
8991810	8995836	Um, there's no blog that I'm aware of that checks all the free stuff.
8996277	8999381	Uh, it's just that- I was like self-censoring, did you hear that?
8999401	8999722	Yeah.
9000523	9001124	That's awesome.
9001965	9004709	Um, it- I just hate to say it, but-
9005345	9009950	I got no life, and I'm constantly checking things on the store.
9010250	9010671	You know what?
9010751	9011472	It's okay, dude.
9012072	9020060	Like, when Game Room was still, like, new and fresh, and the games were really notable, like, every Wednesday, I would plop on the couch and run over and see what came out, you know?
9020341	9023064	And Virtual Console, and it was new, too, so no worries, dude.
9024989	9035392	I really won't get into my opinion of the free show because what I think of the show may differ from what you or Jamie or Loki would think of the show.
9036152	9039293	My own opinion would probably be irrelevant.
9040173	9041893	Sum it up into one sentence.
9043914	9046174	Basically, it's a free show.
9046414	9048935	Even if you download it and hate the show...
9049699	9051521	It's free.
9051721	9053382	That was a perfect sentence, Spazinator.
9053482	9054283	It's a free show.
9055724	9056144	Perfect.
9056344	9056745	Perfect.
9057405	9057705	All right.
9059667	9073518	On a related note, for those of us in our age group that grew up with it, they just started putting, of all things, He-Man and Masters of the Universe on the PlayStation Network.
9073738	9074379	Dude, really?
9074779	9075960	Dude, is She-Ra up yet?
9077362	9081183	Not yet, but at this rate, I wonder if it goes up there soon.
9081863	9085244	They don't have all the episodes up yet, just 33.
9086244	9087845	But damn, damn it all.
9089365	9092746	I grew up, you know, watching that show religiously.
9092886	9095867	I mean, you know, that and Voltron and Transformers.
9096767	9101088	I mean, you know, I practically had an orgasm once I realized it went up on the store.
9101409	9102989	And granted, you know,
9103362	9108365	The first one I saw was, you know, they had a sale at the same time, $0.99 each.
9108946	9119533	I read what I could for it, which was only two episodes, but as soon as I can, I'm going to snatch up the rest.
9120174	9123336	And, you know, if only they put up, like, G.I.
9123396	9129420	Joe and the rest of the episodes of Transformers, you know, season two and onward,
9131069	9132471	I'd be a happy camper, you know?
9147589	9153373	There is actually a channel, I don't remember what it's called now, but in the Sacramento area that plays old cartoons like that.
9153654	9156256	They even play the original Ghostbusters cartoon.
9156576	9161700	Not the 80s cartoon, but the one that actually predated the movies from the 70s.
9162400	9164222	Whose station is that?
9164682	9165943	Fox's number two?
9166603	9168325	I don't remember.
9168385	9169666	It's not the Moore or...
9171847	9174909	My friend actually watches a lot of that stuff.
9175069	9176871	Some of those are still changing.
9177391	9182915	One of them, the Fox affiliate here had a second channel that was nothing but music videos.
9183275	9185417	It was like what MTV should have been, but that went away.
9185477	9187258	It only lasted like four years and it went away.
9188279	9200908	If you haven't checked it out, because not all cable companies pick them up, get your HDTV to search for signals in the area because that's kind of part of the cool thing about HDTV is that now your NBC station only ever had one channel, but now they have like three or four.
9202350	9202770	Some of them.
9202850	9209892	And some of them are weird, like we have this one, it's like More TV Sacramento, where they play these random movies, like these strangest movies out there.
9209912	9216573	Some of them are going to be like gospel, and some of them are nothing but the Weather Channel, but local, but there's some, you'll find some weird shit out there.
9216973	9217513	Anyhow, sorry.
9218894	9229556	Yeah, you know, I can't really knock, you know, Netflix, because, you know, I never used it, so I can't really say anything positive or negative about it until I use it.
9230582	9235927	You know, the thing is with me, in order to use it, I would have to get a credit card.
9236207	9247557	I don't have one currently, so I'm basically stuck buying things off of either Xbox Live, Zoom Marketplace, or PSN.
9247958	9257326	And in a way, it kind of works out, in a way, because, you know, it may be kind of expensive, but
9258189	9286836	depending on how you look at compared to other ways of getting stuff but at the same time it's also cheaper at least in the sense that you can buy the stuff piecemeal a little over time over an extended period of time and not only that but at least compared to getting stuff on Blu-ray or DVD or whatever where you're basically stuck getting
9288298	9298543	every episode of one particular season where you're really only allowed, let's say, episode of five of whatever series.
9298944	9303486	Well, it's nice if nothing else, at least there's different options out there, you know?
9305567	9305887	Yeah.
9305947	9309469	Yeah, granted the PSN's not perfect.
9309909	9315352	I've been on board on the show multiple times complaining about here and there, you know,
9316181	9318582	But, you know, at least it's out there.
9318662	9319283	It's an option.
9319783	9321264	It's something you can do at least.
9321944	9322184	All right.
9322465	9324286	Spazinator, we're going to let you go so we wrap up the show.
9324326	9325346	But thanks so much for your call.
9325506	9326207	Really appreciate it.
9326967	9327467	Have a good one, buddy.
9327487	9327828	No problem.
9328788	9329408	All right.
9329609	9331169	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9331229	9332210	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
9332510	9334991	And if you're sitting there going, why is it always the same people?
9335032	9337253	It's always the same people every week that get through on Skype.
9337273	9338053	Why is it always the same people?
9338073	9339114	Because you're not calling us.
9340393	9344074	So if you're mad at hearing the same people every week, you've got to give us a call.
9344094	9347795	1-877-GAME-OLR Or remember, there are other ways you can interact with the show.
9348095	9353756	If you're shy and you're like, I don't want people to hear my voice, or you don't want your parents knowing that you're calling, that's fine.
9353856	9354476	Give us an email.
9354556	9357557	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com We don't want you to get in trouble.
9357577	9358517	You can also send us tweets.
9358877	9361638	This is the show where every gamer has a voice.
9362038	9363698	We want to make sure you are heard.
9364318	9368339	Anyhow, any more last-minute stories we want to get to tonight, Loki, before we wrap things up?
9371071	9377597	Halo Wars, they're turning off the servers December 15th Getting rid of the leaderboard and stat tracking as well as the forums
9391609	9393330	They're just throwing it all away, aren't they?
9394150	9396491	Are forums that expensive to maintain, really?
9409396	9427307	and um so it says more importantly the forums will disappear and so will online stat tracking and it says um I know this will be rough on a lot of you guys this is from one of the forum mods and here's some of the comments game is dead fuck you no stat tracking you just killed this game fuck you
9428247	9448855	they are cheap bastards I'm buying this domain when they let it go lol and says possibly the most close-knit video game forum community is going to be tossed with a bunch of reach junkies so TigerClaw sent me this link he wanted me to play for you Loki see if maybe you might recognize this
9457103	9459064	Yeah, I mean, the original Ghostbusters.
9460665	9461965	Wow, this is old.
9464386	9470028	I was thinking about the Ghostbusters and the real Ghostbusters, but I didn't even know there was this really old one.
9470048	9471629	We used to watch this all the time.
9471689	9473110	My little brothers loved it.
9474130	9480413	And when we were really, really little, we had this... It was a garage that had been converted to a playroom.
9481513	9485135	And they'd take this big chair and put a driving wheel in front of it and try to beat the car.
9485515	9485855	Nice.
9487853	9491816	Jeremy Ta, one in our chatroom, is kind of pissed about this story that Loki just reported on.
9492176	9494718	I'm sorry, but this whole server pulling thing is bullshit.
9495098	9500482	Someone pays $60 for a game should be able to play it online for at least a few years without them turning it off.
9500502	9501263	Now, here's the thing, though.
9501363	9503645	I don't think it says that they're taking down the online.
9503665	9506187	They're just taking down the leaderboards and stat tracking.
9506247	9508528	It's all the frills that come on the website.
9508568	9511951	I still think you can play online because it's Microsoft's live servers.
9511991	9513452	I can't imagine they'd take those down.
9513912	9515613	What else do you pay for gold for?
9536679	9545607	and I guess, I don't know, it kind of tries to bring this like legitimacy, quote unquote, to the video game scene, but I'm just kind of like, eh, I don't need it.
9546407	9553714	But for the record, if you're curious what they nominated, Game of the Year, Call of Duty, Black Ops, God of War 3, Halo Reach, Mass Effect 2, Red Dead Redemption.
9554875	9556336	Those are the nominees for Game of the Year.
9558197	9560399	Okay, no surprises there.
9560960	9562221	Any other last minute stories, Loki?
9563258	9589086	I think that's about it fan made Thief 2 multiplayer beta has been released so if you're a fan of Thief 2 and wish that you could have played it with more than one person then you might want to check it out alright well it's time for us to wrap up the show and get on out of here for the night and you know so forth so DarkSakura do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight money I can have some
9591046	9591507	Pinkberry!
9591827	9592067	I know.
9592407	9593287	Oh, man, you just took mine.
9593307	9594968	I was going to say my final thought is Pinkberry.
9595008	9595769	Can I have some?
9596249	9598970	But I'll just say Four Day Vacation.
9599030	9599691	Can I has it?
9600731	9602332	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9603352	9608253	My final thought is I get to make turkey.
9609514	9610054	Turducken?
9610394	9610994	No, just turkey.
9611694	9614115	Turducken's just too... I don't think that'd be too much.
9614395	9614935	What are you doing?
9616796	9621097	Since both you and the missus have parents local, you kind of have to do like two Thanksgivings at once, right?
9622117	9622658	Not necessarily.
9622678	9624038	We just have everybody over at our house.
9624478	9625958	Oh, smart.
9626739	9627459	Good luck with that this year.
9628396	9629637	Alright, that's it guys.
