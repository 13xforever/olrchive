Tonight, November 14th, 2010, the creators of Rock Band are up for sale, a popular DS title finally gets localized for Japan, and did the indie games movement backlash cause change at Microsoft?
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
Walking you through gaming chat over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and with me as always my awesome co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
I'm upset with you, Rob.
Why now?
Because of this game.
Ooh, you're playing Knights of the Old Sorority, as we talked about last week.
Knights of the Vampire Mafia War thing.
I blame you.
Well, it is my fault.
We'll talk about stupid clicky games in a minute.
But we have to say hello, of course, to the one and only Techmaster eBay-lovin', Loki!
Hey.
How are you doing, Loki?
I'm doing fine.
All right.
What are you shopping for on eBay now?
I'm not shopping for anything.
I was just looking at something.
I was just curious to see how much it went for.
Do you do this at home, too, shopping on eBay all the time, or does the wife get pissed?
I don't actually shop on eBay all the time.
All right.
I was going to pick up something later on, but not for a while.
They have this XCM V-Box 2.
It allows you to play...
Xbox games and stuff like that pretty much anything that has a component in or component out on your PC without lags so like for example the other day when I was shuffling to get it to work correctly I remember the DJ Hero 2 I would have been able to play it just fine so I might pick that up because it will be handy for different things but yeah that and my rather be playing Grand Theft Auto license plate frame that I probably should get for my car because that would be funny
Alright, by the way, I went over to Loki's house to play some Kinect the other night and that was good times.
Yep.
Shaking the butt in front of the camera that takes the pictures over and over again.
My room is really small to play.
So is my apartment, so it's all good.
I'm thinking of mounting the TV to the wall just for multiple reasons because the cat also likes to use the scratching post.
There you go.
Pretty soon you're going to have the baby running around, so it might not be a bad idea.
You've got at least nine months to go, but you know.
I'm not worried about that.
I think, though, mounting it to the wall would give me an extra foot or two to be able to, you know, so I won't have to be up against the couch to actually play, you know, Connected Adventures.
It's dumb, that requirement.
By the way, finally, because it's just, I hardly ever get to Loki's house anymore, I don't know why, but I finally got to meet the baby, and I got to see the nursery that is all internet famous, like, you know, the pictures were on, what, GameStops magazine thingy, right?
Yeah.
They found him through Flickr or whatever.
I was going to take some video for you guys, but the baby was going to bed.
It wasn't a good time.
But maybe one of these days I'll get the video.
I can take video too, I guess.
I do have a video camera.
It's a nice setup.
You should kind of show off a little more.
It's very gamer nerdy.
Let's just hope the baby does not grow up to resent video games.
That would be a tragedy.
By the way, speaking of nerdy stuff, I saw the best license plate in the world today.
You ready?
Ready, nerds?
It was LoadStar81.
Nice.
Allen
Salacious Pulp
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Should I tell my story about Chocobo Farm Town or whatever that is now or later?
Go ahead.
So I started playing that game because they have a banner under the whole Knights of the Old Crystal Sorority War game on Facebook.
I started playing the Chocobo Tower, and it's actually kind of cute.
There's some things about it, but there's a lot to it, and a lot of it's just kind of WTF.
And Alan walks in while I'm trying to play this earlier.
He's like, what are you doing?
I'm like, I'm trying to...
I'm trying to play this game, and I'm trying to breed my chocobo with Jamie's chocobo.
Like, I went to her farm to try and sex her chocobo while she's not online to defend it.
And Alan's like, well, wait, your chocobo's just a baby.
You can't do that.
I'm like, I just fed it a growth cake.
And then I'm like, what is this?
Is this what my life has become?
I'm talking about breeding chocobos like it's real life?
Is this the future of video games?
All defensive that you aged it with the magical cake.
You're like, I gave it the cake.
What are you talking about?
Look at your life.
Look at your choices.
Like, I hear you judging me, but I gave it cake.
It looks, what I saw of it, it just looked like a sort of more detailed web sort of Digipet Tamagotchi type thing.
Because you have to brush it when it gets dirty, so you click on the little bird.
It's like Pet Society, only they go and battle each other.
It's ridiculous stupid, yet I'm playing it anyway.
They go off for hot chicken love.
And I totally sexed Jamie's chicken when she wasn't looking.
and I snuck into Ranch last night and put feathers in the Chocobo's hair.
I'm going to go take them because then I'll get extra luck for them.
Nice.
You punked out my Chocobo.
You pimped my Chocobo.
That's it.
It's called Pimp My Chocobo.
You know, this is not any better than playing, say, Farmville, so I am going to look at you in shame.
No, because it's Square Enix.
No, I'm sorry.
Hold on.
The artwork in the Knights of the Crystal Republic Vampire Wars is by the same guy who did Tactics artwork.
And it's not Farmville.
Oh, okay.
Well, I must be completely wrong then.
Yes, you are.
Except I'm not.
Because that's never happened in the course of this show.
I'm never wrong.
DarkSakura, are there any other video games you'd like to talk about?
Yes.
I played a bunch of the Avatar game that got left at my house, what, three months ago?
So you're finally getting around to it?
I like it.
So being an Avi in Second Life didn't work out for you, so now you get to...
I got tired of those people.
But I really liked the game except that your Ikran, the banshee thing, I parked it so I could go get some stuff out of these flowers.
I came back and it was dead.
It got shot up.
It was laying dead in the water.
And I'm like, now where am I going to get another one?
So I was like, well, crap.
Did you have an emotional breakdown like the characters in the movie when they're, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
In fact, it was like when the character first hops around in her avatar body and walks around, she goes up to the human people and goes, You're so tiny!
It's cute!
And we squishy tiny little heads!
I picked a female character.
I need to introduce the ever-present fourth guest on our show, even though technically Salacious Pulp is the fourth guest tonight.
We have our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and you can join us in chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
Let's see.
Jim Sally in our chatroom says, Japan's working on genetically creating chocobos right now.
Could be.
They need to talk to the KFC people.
Frisbee says, Navi or Navi?
Hello!
Hey!
Watch out!
Listen!
Hey!
DarkSakura!
Listen!
Hey!
Don't make me smite you.
Dan got Call of Booty Black Ops.
Now that's a game I'd play.
No, it's Call of Duty.
And speaking of Avatar, because it has a dude as the main guy's voice.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Did you hear, though, that you can play the full game of Zork in there?
Yes, you can.
I was listening to Bobby tonight on the car ride over, and yes, he was talking about it on his show, and I was like, that's actually really cool.
Like, Call of Duty, not my genre of game.
Not disrespecting the game.
I realize a lot of people play those games.
I don't.
And the minigame.
But I think that's cool.
That plays a lot like Smash TV.
Dan was like all over that.
And then he's like, oh, it's like Smash TV.
And his friend had never played Smash TV.
So Dan's like, we're turning this off.
We're playing Smash TV.
Call of Booty.
They need to make that porn.
I know, totally.
It would not be as great as the porn.
Oh, porn tangent.
Sound the alarm.
Okay, so we're at Loki's house, right?
And Loki has tons... Just so you all know, Loki and the Mrs. have tons and tons and tons of pornography stored on their Xbox.
But it's not like real It's actually on my PC, but we stream it Whatever, it's not real porn It's all like funny porn And we watched a porno called Not the Cosby's No, there's lots of real porn on there too, but we watched funny porn We watched funny ones, okay That's just inappropriate, you don't just whip out normal porn Oh, okay, sorry Having a dinner party, hey, look at, wow I'm such a 12 year old I know you are
All right, if you want to see her 12-year-old antics during her tarot, we were watching Not the Cosbys 2, which were all these Cosby family lookalikes, and they were having sex, but not really with each other.
But the weird thing about it to me was that there was 15 minutes of setup and parody to the plot.
It's probably the longest intro I've ever seen where it was actually just dialogue.
I like how my gaming has turned to porn.
Yeah.
I just want to say it was also very disturbing that there was a Rudy.
There is already a Call of Booty, actually.
Is there really?
It is Call of Booty, Modern Horrorfare.
Of course, Modern Horrorfare.
My bad.
Ah, yes.
Ah!
God bless the porn industry Amen Speaking of video games and porn and we covered this on Comic Insanity this morning because it was WTF News Some guy on RPG Maker 3000 made Marvel Brothel where Professor X decides that instead of bridging the gap between humans and mutants instead of sending out his heroines to go help people he's going to pimp them out
I had a story coming up on that later.
You did?
That's alright.
Nobody cared.
It's alright.
I didn't know.
Here's the deal, guys.
When I report it as news later on in the second half of the show, I want you all to act surprised.
Like you've never heard about this before.
This is totally new information.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
Everybody just make me feel important and when I talk about this in the second half, I want you all to pretend you've never heard about this before.
Anyway, continue.
Pretend Rob's covered in angry tics.
Oh wow, Rob!
You're buzzing!
The guy that they have playing Bill Cosby is just a ringer for Bill Cosby.
He's a comedian though, so he doesn't actually do any of the porn in there.
He takes the high road, I guess.
But seriously though, the guy looks and sounds like Bill Cosby.
It's just weird.
It's kind of scary.
I was really disturbed by the fact there was a Rudy, but at least I didn't see her naked, even though I'm sure she was 18.
I mean, that would just be wrong.
I think Denise was the only one I saw.
Who went off to college in a different world?
Okay, that was Denise.
Denise got banged in one of the scenes and that's the one we watched.
I was like, okay, yeah, alright, turn it off.
And then we watched Harry Potter, God of Little Fire with Netflix with Riff Trax.
That has to be funny.
I watched part of Avatar with Riff Trax.
That was pretty funny.
I know I played other stuff.
I played Robot Unicorn Attack in the middle of Starbucks again, which was pretty fun.
And...
Yeah, that's Carl of Duty.
Yeah, Tigerclaw linked me to this.
Carl of Duty.
I've seen that.
It's Black Cops, and it's Carl from Family Matters.
And it's very badly photoshopped.
Which, funny enough, when we were watching this Not the Cosby's thing, I said, when are they going to do the one with Family Matters, but they will actually have the daughter from Family Matters?
Oh, she's doing porn?
Yeah, the middle one.
That'd be tough because they could have also done the same thing with Saved by the Bell, but they didn't.
Instead, they chose to have really funny wigs on them.
I totally saw something that made me think of you.
The Showgirls Anniversary Edition.
I bought it.
Damn it, now I can't buy it for you.
I'm sorry.
Which anniversary?
Blu-ray, whatever 15th, I think Is it sad that I know that?
Yes, it is Anyhow, video games Yes, your gaming week Anything else that you want to talk about?
Loki, how was your gaming week?
I didn't play a whole lot.
Mainly just Grand Theft Auto and then the Kinect stuff.
I played a little bit of Dance Central because it was odd.
My living room was big enough to play Kinect Adventures at one time but somehow I guess it shrunk.
Or maybe I didn't calibrate my system again since I switched TVs.
But for whatever reason I couldn't play Kinect Adventures because it kept saying that I was too close to the camera even though I was several feet away.
I know how to do that dance
Well, good.
Then you could finish that part of the song, but this is the rest of it.
Oh, and everybody had fun laughing at me because I had to do the, like, I don't know, they called it the poison where you're like, I don't know.
It's hard to describe.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
God forbid they make it simple to move your profile back and forth between two systems.
Oh no, you have to recover it between systems.
That is a little ridiculous.
I mean, it should be as easy as putting in your username and password.
And they'll make it so easy to go to friends' houses and do the rock band thing or whatever.
Exactly.
Or...
or, um, a memory card.
You know, because that works with a memory card if you play offline.
But as soon as you connect it to live, oh, I'm sorry, this is not meant for this system.
You need to recover your profile.
Yuck.
And your profile is not that big.
I mean, it's a few megs at the most.
But it takes, like, a goddamn half hour to download.
It takes forever to go through this stuff.
Well...
I don't know about a half hour because Alan and I kind of have to do that a lot.
It took me 10 minutes.
And I have a really fast internet connection.
Weird.
It doesn't matter how fast your connection is.
It just takes forever to download a stupid 10 meg file or whatever.
It's very inconvenient.
That's why I haven't really done that yet.
I just need to get rid of my other system and then go from there.
Other than stuff on there, I played some iOS games.
I just played a little bit of Rock Band.
That's kind of fun.
It kind of makes me wish they had an O2 Jam game or something like that.
Or DJ Max or something like that on the iPhone or iPod.
That'd be kind of cool.
That's pretty much it.
I'll get in my gaming week and I'll let Alan have a shot, although I know he watched me play a lot of this stuff, so maybe he'll want to chime in, I don't know.
But I was playing a little bit of Dance Masters, which Loki was kind enough to loan me, and I thought I brought, didn't I put it in the car?
I was going to bring it back to him?
I don't know.
Yeah, you grabbed something.
I had no big deal if you didn't.
I played a little bit of Dance Masters, which is, it's okay.
You know, again, I like the look of it a little better than Dance Masters.
I do really like the look of the game.
Night of Fire Did You Unlock Any Songs?
A few, I haven't done a ton.
Because I've seen the full track list, and yeah, it's a lot of DDR stuff, but I was just surprised to see Afronova Primeval on there.
Why has it always got to be Primeval?
I mean, seriously, why can't you just put the regular Afronova?
I mean, I don't understand.
But the exotic ethnic dance is funny.
Well, I know, though, that a lot of the dances that were in there, you're saying, are Lukpara-influenced, they're Tekpara-influenced.
Well, I know the exotic ethnic one, if you've ever heard that song, is a very Egyptian-sounding song, and you do all these little walk-like and Egyptian moves that are really stupid.
But Loki hit the nail on the head when he talked about this game last week.
How are you supposed to learn these dances?
There's no break-it-down type of mode or anything.
I mean, unlike Dance Central, easy, medium, and hard are all the same dance.
It's just that you have more you have to hit.
so I think that's how it wants you to learn it is that you have to do the silhouettes and easy and then you have to add some of the circles and medium and then so I think that's how you learn I'm not sure if it's as effective as Dance Central was just watching you play some of those Dance Master songs I didn't know how you were doing it and I know that you were playing them on Expert but I was I mean I could see you mimicking what was on the screen but it was so fast I was like how are you doing this like I didn't understand you just memorize it you memorize dance
It's just the silhouettes is all that you're really mimicking.
It's basically learn to para para really quickly.
Actdeft in our chatroom says Primeval is from Dance Maniacs slash Freaks, which is Parapara-esque.
I doubt it would be the same dance, though.
I mean, you gotta see what some of these things look like.
The whole wax on, wax off dancing wouldn't work.
There's lots of Sailor Moon sort of salutes.
Yeah, there are.
There's a lot of cute, chibi things in the game.
I mean, and here's the other thing, and I know they've said numerous times, oh, this time around we're gonna really support download content.
Don't see anything yet.
I wanted to try that one, but... You actually get to go choo-choo a lot in it.
Awesome!
Yes, you go choo-choo.
And I think Alan was practically pointing and laughing the whole time.
It was pretty funny.
But yeah, he didn't play.
A new Kinect game I tried this week was Kinect Joyride.
I played the demo a little bit.
Why are you laughing?
The color of your car.
Okay, you saw the color of your car thing.
That was dumb.
It was the most fun I had playing the game.
Really?
Maybe I don't want to share why.
Maybe Alan will, but I'm not sharing why it was the most fun part of the game.
Well, if it's anything like what we did, then yes.
And it required my wife standing on the couch, but that's another story.
No, it's seriously, it's all pick a color.
I'm like, I just want to pick red.
I don't want to have to find something red in my house.
I just want to pick red or pick green.
It's all, no, pick something on the camera.
And you've seen, like, you know, webcams and how they get very pixelated and the color's kind of off.
Everything ends up being like a palish white or pink or, like, purple, no matter whatever the color is.
I definitely got a pale pink color.
Oh, so you went for Ass Pink?
Something like that, yeah.
Anyhow, so there was that.
But then it went black for a second.
I just realized it captured my asshole.
Anyway...
Kidding.
Except I'm not.
Let's see.
So yeah, I played Joyride and it was dopey.
I didn't like it at all.
I thought Mario Kart controlled better on the Wii.
Watching you play it, it looked like it had a pretty steep learning curve because when it looked at first couple minutes, you were sort of all over the place.
And I was like, this game looks like it controls horribly.
And you said that it kind of did.
But by the third or fourth lap, you were reading a lot better.
So I just think it has a...
It might have a little learning curve to it.
I don't know.
Granted, I only played the demo and I shouldn't base an impression of the game off the demo, but the demo did not leave me wanting to get the full game.
I got the full game.
Did you?
Did you like it better than the demo?
I actually haven't played the full game yet.
I also haven't played Kinect Sports yet.
That's the other game that I got, but I haven't played that yet.
I'm worried that it's going to say, well, sorry, your living room is too small.
Again.
Um, let's see, what else did I play this week?
Um, I was most, I mean, otherwise the same old stuff, Warcraft, Rock Band 3, I've been playing more of that.
I want to try the Your Shape Fitness demo.
Is there a demo on the Adventures disc?
Yeah.
Oh, I'll have to try it.
If you put the disc in and go to your, um, you know, you can either go in there and play the demo, or you can just do it through your actual demo channel thing.
Okay.
So yeah, other than the dance games and that, that was pretty much it.
Not a lot of new stuff this week, so maybe next week.
That was the one big game.
Otherwise, I've been playing the stuff I have, which is novel for me.
Alan, anything you want to add for your gaming week?
Just World of Warcraft More and more, what's going on in your WoW worlds these days?
I've sort of set up these goals for myself to accomplish by the time Cataclysm comes out And they're not necessarily things that are going away when Cataclysm comes out It's just stuff to keep me busy, occupied for the last four weeks But yeah, I'm trying to get 100 mounts to get that reward
Good time.
Because once it comes out, I'm going to be looking at all the new content and I'm not going to be able to grind all that stupid stuff.
So that's what I'm doing now.
Is there anything this holiday season that you're looking forward to besides Cataclysm?
I haven't really been following the releases because I usually buy that stuff for myself.
Gotcha.
I'm not following it really.
All right.
Well, maybe you can find good deals on last year's holiday releases or just watch Steam because that's...
Oh yeah, Steam I'm sure is going to have, you know, 8 games for 10 cents or whatever their Christmas sale is.
And I'll be like, sure, I'll pick up some stuff.
Exactly.
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's gaming news.
Not a whole lot of housekeeping tonight.
I will just say, please join our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
Or of course you can follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
Otherwise, I don't think I have a whole lot to report tonight.
There's the spin-off shows that DarkSakura and myself have DarkSakura hosts a show called Comic Insanity Just drop the I and you can find them on iTunes and Infamous.net
That's right.
And the official first episode of the new podcast I'm doing with Extifer.
If you like Warcraft talk, I would let Alan go on forever, but there's a whole new show for that now.
It's Horde House.
The best little Horde House in Azeroth.
It's not on iTunes yet.
We're trying to get it there.
But more information is available.
There's a link on our Twitter.
We have a Twitter over there too.
Twitter.com slash Horde House.
So that's our spinoff projects.
Probably won't end there.
Maybe Loki will get a side project soon enough.
Who knows what else is going to happen.
Yeah, when am I going to have time for a side project?
Seriously.
Raising a baby, 101.
All right.
Let's move on with some gaming news.
Loki, there's always time for gaming news, at least.
Yes, there is.
Of course, the news came out this week that Harmonix is being sold by Viacom.
The question in everybody's mind is, to whom?
um of course you know EA sounds like a likely candidate because for one they've been publishing their games lately and two they seem to like snap up um you know popular developers I mean they did the same thing with Valve and with um a bunch of other ones I mean they have literally a slew of development houses working on games for them
So, it seems like it might be likely.
Other things that people have thrown out there that might be interesting possible candidates.
Microsoft, which would be really interesting if that happened.
Because then they would have basically Rock Band 2 themselves.
Which would be very strange.
And then possibly Activision.
But God, I hope that doesn't happen.
A lot of people in our chatroom yelling out Konami.
Okay.
Pro Evolution Soccer
That's basically it.
I mean, you know, there are other titles, you know, top titles that they have coming out.
Yeah, they have a DDR game.
By the way, I think Dance Dance Revolution came out this week on PlayStation 3 and Wii.
Oh, congrats, I guess.
Yeah.
That made a big splash.
Really?
You know, Dance Masters.
But those aren't really going to make them a ton of money.
Tiger Claw's throwing out Ubisoft.
Ubisoft.
I don't know if Ubisoft would do that.
I mean, they have their own music stuff.
And I don't know if they're big enough to where they'd be purchasing this stuff.
If anything, it's probably going to be EA.
X-Link says Atlas.
Come on, guys.
Now you're just reaching.
That's just retarded.
Squeenix.
Squeenix Eidos Harmonix.
Final Fantasy Dance Master or whatever.
Oh, my gosh.
So, other things you may be concerned because they're being sold and stuff.
What's that mean about the download content that's going to be coming out for these games?
Well, apparently it's not going to interrupt the download content that's going on.
They've already been working on stuff and that's not going to be affected by the sale at all.
They work on that stuff like four months out.
So, they're set through the holidays at least.
Yeah, so nothing's really going anywhere there.
And then, of course, also, if you are interested in purchasing some new download content for Rock Band 2, you may not be able to do that anymore.
In fact, actually, all Rock Band tracks, both DLC and...
I guess just the DLC is actually going to be incompatible with Rock Band 1 and 2.
It says apparently the Rock Band Network tracks will be compatible with all versions.
So at least you have an avenue for that stuff until they update the software for that.
So you will need to upgrade to Rock Band 3.
DarkSakura.com
It's going to cost you $2 to pay for the new Rock Band 3 version of the songs if you'd like to have keyboard and harmony upgrades.
If you want pro guitar bass versions of those songs, you're going to need to buy or need to purchase the pro upgrade, which will be for another dollar.
So $3 for an upgrade for these songs.
And that's each song, by the way.
So yeah, it's very interesting stuff.
Sorry, I got distracted because I got an email.
I'm not allowed to say it because it's under non-disclosure agreement, but I just got into a beta I've been waiting to get into for months and months and months and months, so I'm like... Sorry.
Invite, please.
If I'm shaking it, I'll try, but it's under NDA, so I can't say anything more about it, but I'm shaking and crying over here.
My bad.
Sorry, I know everybody hates that.
I know something you don't know, guy, but that's why I'm distracted.
I'm just telling you all I have an excuse.
I have a very good excuse.
Is it for Naughty Bear 2?
No.
yes it's for Naughty Bear 2 okay now they're gonna boot me I'm so so sad it's for Final Fantasy 14 oh wait I'm sorry that's just a regular subscription that's just called buying the PC version I like how they this one didn't make their show role or whatever but I like how they came out and said yeah we understand that the game's terrible we're working on it though it's like that doesn't excuse the fact they put the game out and it's terrible
So I wanted to say also about the developer situation and Harmonix getting sold and all that stuff.
I don't think this is quite the end of the world.
I think some people are making it out to be.
Harmonix is still... I mean, they're very well respected in the industry.
They do a lot of great stuff.
I do think losing the relationship with MTV Games is going to be a bummer for them because I think that's part of what's pushed that Rock Band DLC to the next level.
But let's face it.
Rock Band DLC has always been like...
And it's a household name now.
I don't really think that people need to convince, you know, they don't need the MTV backing to convince bands to be in Rock Band.
Yeah.
I mean, they have plenty of history and plenty of, you know, data to show them, hey, look, see, DLC on this, you know, sells and you'll make some money or, you know, it's worthwhile.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, so I don't think it's the end of the world for them.
I don't know if we'll hear much through this holiday season, but I don't know if we'll hear about a change of hands just before Christmas, but I think probably in the new year.
But I wouldn't say doom and gloom for the Rock Band franchise yet.
I think it'll still sell well through the holidays too.
I can't believe people are already saying this game is a sales failure.
People have been saying before these games even came out, they've been saying music games are over.
Yeah.
Music games will never be over.
People are dumb.
They're like, well I can't take another plastic instrument.
You don't have to fucking buy another plastic instrument for every goddamn game that comes out.
Why are you buying multiple plastic instruments for these things?
Music games might not be the next big fad anymore, but music games are a long way from going out.
We'll always have Glee.
Thanks for watching!
I mean, sure, people get jaded about the fact that, you know, oh, they're just out for money.
And, you know, Green Day Rock Band kind of seemed like, oh, they're out for money.
You know, instead of saying, oh, it's the Green Day Rock Band track pack or something like that.
They used to do trackpacks where they put stuff out and there'd be some download content you could play before it hits service or whatever.
Or you could play these games standalone by themselves and it's like $20 for a game versus full price.
Ranma in our chatroom is asking, Loki, question, do you think that the music games are declining?
are they declining?
I don't think so I think Rock Band 3 sorry I'm cutting you off and interjecting my own answer but whatever Rock Band 3 is definitely a step above Rock Band 2 and it's a worthy upgrade DJ Hero 2 is a worthy step above DJ Hero 1 I think maybe there might be room to do something more original but at the same time don't put another plastic instrument in my house
Yeah, and that being said also, though, you know, Rock Band 3 did introduce the keyboards, which I don't see that as a bad thing.
It's not like we're, you know, first off, it's not required that you have a keyboard.
If it's something that you want, then you can pick it up.
You don't need to necessarily go and buy, you know, some brand new stuff.
And the instruments that they released this year, because they do have standalone instruments for Rock Band 3,
They're not really, other than the pro guitar that they have out there, and then the guitar that's a real guitar, other than those optional instruments, all the instruments are the same.
Dan was just saying today how he wanted the wireless Logitech guitar controller.
For Rockhand.
No, he wants it.
The higher quality, better made.
But he pointed it out and said, this is what I want.
So I think that the whole plastic instrument thing argument can go right down the toilet because an enthusiast is gonna buy them.
I have a guitar.
I have a Fender guitar.
It's actually a wood guitar that's made for Rock Band.
It was a $300 guitar at one time.
Got it for a third the price.
But it's pretty awesome.
Let me ask this question when you guys talk about music games dying and all this stuff.
Would you consider Child of Eden a music game?
No.
I never really consider Child of Eden.
No, you know what I'm talking about, or is it Children of Eden?
I've never really considered it.
And I have that pre-ordered.
I cannot wait to get that game.
But Children of Eden, you know, the res-y... Yeah, but I never considered it.
Like, you don't want to buy it?
You're not interested in it at all?
No, just, I keep forgetting about it because I have a lot of other stuff going on.
Well, it's not also going to be out this year anyway.
Yeah, it's like, I haven't really bothered to think about it until it comes an option for me to be able to get.
Well, the reason why I'm throwing that out there is because maybe we're looking at an evolution of music games or something new.
And I think that's just what the music game genre needs is something new that's interesting.
And this whole Kinect slash Move slash whatever, 3DS even, could bring us kind of the next interesting thing in gaming.
But as far as the whole plastic guitars and drums, I think there's only so much you can do with that.
and it's really hard to surpass what Rock Band 3 is bringing to the table and it is and honestly Rock Band 3's features aren't for everyone and it's basically the response both companies, both Harmonix and both Activision understand that maybe their sales are taking a hit a little bit and the music games aren't exactly as I should say not necessarily as popular but aren't making as big of a splash anymore as they were previously
And with Rock Band though, they haven't really been trying to put out tons of releases.
I mean, the Green Day thing was kind of a one-off thing and then the Beatles, that was kind of something different where it was mainly that was just going to be all-inclusive in it.
And yeah, I know they had the Lego Rock Band game, but that was more of a grab to try to get the family audience in there.
It also wasn't Harmonix.
Um, well, they developed it, but it was Warner Brothers, yeah, that published it.
Oh, I thought another developer kind of took the Rock Band code and did it.
Uh, yeah, I know what you mean, Traveler's Hills, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
But anyways, but that game had an awesome soundtrack, and I, you know...
I'm actually trying to find a copy of Lego Rock Band for super cheap.
I think I could just order it on Amazon for like $14 just to get the songs in my Rock Band 3 collection.
It really is worth it.
But other than that, I mean, they've kind of taken it two different routes.
Guitar Hero decided this year that they're going to go back to their roots, they said, and make it all about rock.
And that's cool and all.
And they had a decent track list and stuff like that.
But
it's not like that big a deal I mean if you like the songs cool and you can buy them and you know upgrade and stuff like that but it's not like it's adding new ways to play the game other than this quest mode that and they have like challenges per songs and stuff like that download content that's neat but it's just it doesn't seem like a lot worse Rock Band 3 they went ahead added new instruments new pro modes new lessons and stuff like that you know harmonies
Just a bunch of stuff to it, and plus it has a library of thousands of songs.
Let me throw this out there too, speaking of this whole next evolution of the music-based game and so forth.
Think about this too.
I think you have to consider this a music game.
What is the number one Kinect title going to be this holiday season, besides Kinect Adventures, the pack-in game?
Dance Central.
It's going to be Dance Central.
Dance Central made by Harmonix.
So, you know, that's going to be a big thing for them, I think.
And, you know, even if not everybody is into dancing, it just shows you there are other things that haven't been done yet.
And they've already got download content for it.
No.
All right.
Anyway, let's move on.
Sorry, I don't want to spend too much time on this.
But, you know, we have a soft spot for music-based games here at OLR.
Speaking of the Kinect though, this is somewhat interesting slash exciting.
A new open source Kinect camera driver has been released.
So, you know, ever since the Kinect came out, it's been everybody's job to try and hack it slash crack it.
Although some people have criticized me like earlier this evening about my usage of that term.
Whatever you want to call it, people are using the Kinect for their own purposes on the PC.
Yeah.
A hacker by the name of Hector Martin has managed to do basically what the NUI group's Alex P announced that they did, the whole connect functionality versus the PC.
Martin released his code out to the public.
So you can actually see what that looks like when you're running it there.
They have like a little YouTube up right there.
All it does right now is it displays what the Kinect quote-unquote sees right now, kind of using little RGB.
It looks like one of those thermal cams when you're kind of looking at what it sees.
So very interesting that the driver is out there.
DarkSakura
Anyhow, also something to throw out there is that there is now a Homebrew PC Connect photo app that is out there.
It's by the coder Flowemuc.
It's proof of concept, what they call application.
And there's another YouTube video out there using Connect to track the hand movements, manipulating, resizing photos.
He has not released the software yet, but it's out there on YouTube.
So there it is.
and this is all done within the course of a few weeks so imagine what we're going to be looking at early next year as far as PC homebrew stuff goes.
These people have more free time than I do anyway.
Hey, you know what though?
Better your free time on this than, I don't know, World of Warcraft.
Says the addict.
Or Star Trek Online.
Which I play maybe once a week.
Okay, justify, justify, justify.
For 18 hours at a stretch.
Yeah.
More like one or two.
Mr. I have scheduled raids on Wednesday.
This week, we'll see.
Scheduled raids.
Hanging out with friends.
I know them all in real life.
Scheduled raids.
Almost.
You could also go out for pizza together.
I didn't go this last.
Why am I justifying this to you?
I don't care.
Screw you.
Judge, judge, judge.
Well, how about Nintendo?
See, this is almost douchey, but not quite.
They trademarked the phrase it's on like Donkey Kong.
Sorry, SSJ100Matt said in chat, I don't know, JB did play Second Life.
I do love the chatters.
Oh yeah, Donkey Kong, hey.
It's Nintendo's phrase now.
So now I'm just gonna say it's on, like, Pong.
Well, I mean, like, I don't even like that saying, to be honest.
I've never used it.
No matter where this kind of argument stands, like, I don't even use the phrase it's on, like, Donkey Kong, because you know what?
When it comes to my gaming on the Wii, it's off.
Like, it's unplugged, actually.
Mine has a layer of dust on it right now.
Yeah, it's sitting in a box somewhere.
I've been playing a lot of stuff on my iPhone.
so uh yeah I mean have have fun I guess with the trademark but um I guess if they want to sell shirts or whatever didn't the didn't the Scott Pilgrim movie use that in like their trailers and the um uh posters and stuff maybe that's what they were trying to do is although it's kind of ironic because um kind of comes full circle because there was the whole King Kong thing from Universal and then Universal has the Scott Pilgrim well forget it yeah it's actually not that interesting at all
I'm just rolling my eyes.
They just want to sell t-shirts.
Yeah.
They're just waiting.
Yeah.
Damn them.
So, it's off.
Don't care.
You can say it's on like Tron.
That makes more sense.
Because Tron is cooler than Donkey Kong.
It's on like Tron?
It rhymes!
Donkey Kong Country was an awesome game.
It is an awesome game, and I like how the new game is like, you know,
Actdeft in our chatroom says, and numerous people are referencing this in chat too, Actdeft says, Sky, yeah, the Scott Pilgrim trailers use that phrase.
Don't kid yourself, that's what this is really about.
This isn't... Never mind.
So we talk about stupid Donkey Kong.
That's what it was about.
Well, it worked.
It was on CNN and MSNBC and every freaking news station ran with it.
I feel terrible for contributing to the promotion of that game, so I'm just not going to buy it.
Oh wait, I was going to not buy it anyway, so that's so funny.
A game that people purchased a lot of recently, not Call of Duty, because Call of Duty did sell a lot as well, but it took Fallout New Vegas just a little bit longer.
They did sell 5 million units as well, and I guess combined with a heavy volume of digital downloads,
The game stands to generate $300 million in sales.
And it says, of course, that they are working to patch the game to fix the numerous bugs that were in there.
Whatever, you know.
We can rant on and on about how games get released unfinished just so that they can sell them and have people test them.
Whatever.
Yeah, so there's going to be a PC patch coming out soon.
I think there is already a patch that's in the works for the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, so...
Breakman in our chatroom is asking, is Fallout New Vegas fixed yet?
Kind of, I guess, a reference to the story.
Because that game is broken as fuck.
It's not fixed yet.
But it will be soon.
Don't worry.
You're just going to have a broken game for a while.
How broken is broken as fuck?
Is it seriously like we're talking no boss shows up on level 30?
They're having save issues where I think save games are getting erased.
Oh, that sucks.
Is it Cogwheel Cursor Broken?
Nice reference.
Wow reference, sorry.
They're also doing some tweaks for NVIDIA graphics card users.
And I guess there's some problems with the Havoc drivers.
KC in our chatroom at chat.originalsradio.com says, Yeah, right.
You already bought it.
Why fix it?
They will.
I trust that they will.
I mean, Fallout 3, I think, was kind of the same issue.
They had the same issues where it was buggy.
And, you know, even like with Oblivion and stuff, they had a lot of buggy stuff in there that they went and patched.
I mean, those games are pretty complex.
But, once again, that's still no excuse for testing your games.
But...
I mean, I understand why they release it when they do because, you know, especially towards the holidays, getting your game to a duplicator to get it done.
I mean, there's such a backlog with duplicators right now that you have to release it then in order to make it out before Call of Duty comes out.
But still, though, I mean, put a little bit more effort into, you know, testing your games for bugs.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Back, sort of, to where it was before It's now under the Games and Demos section of the Xbox Live Marketplace So, yeah, and there was no dashboard update or anything So they must have done all that updating on the server end somehow So, yeah, some interesting feedback in the Microsoft forums There's, of course, celebrating going on
Microsoft is listening.
Indie games are back in the game section.
We are having an effect.
The new placement isn't perfect because they want to be front and center.
But it's a huge step in the right direction.
The icon feels very out of place being such a different style and searches and so forth.
It doesn't look like indie games are included but we are in the game section.
So congrats, they're back.
And you know, it seems like a logical place for them to be.
And I can see why they were kind of mad the first time.
But what's also very interesting...
Not only is it that, there's now going to be this developer-led initiative going on called Indie Games Winter Uprising.
It's not quite the same thing that you would think as Summer of Arcade because it's not Microsoft sponsoring this.
This is actually a developer-enabled thing.
But they're going to actually price over a dozen games in Indie Games between 80 to 400 Microsoft points.
So the developers are going to take a hit to try and bring more notice to the indie games.
Which means Microsoft takes a cut too.
But a lot of the indie games are already 80 Microsoft points too.
400 Microsoft points.
So it's not like they're really going to be doing anything.
Well, supposedly these are like big indie titles.
I mean, I'm not sure exactly what that means.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
or something or, you know.
And I think that's kind of what the developers want is they just want Microsoft to throw them a bone.
It's not like Microsoft ain't making money on it.
Yeah, but the problem with these developers though is they're pissed off that there's a lot of like cheap crappy games like all these massage apps and stuff like that.
Hey, BabyMaker Extreme is awesome.
But you know what?
You just need to suck it up and get over it.
Because that's what there is on the stupid Apple App Store and stuff like that.
You have to differentiate your product.
And I understand there's a lot of massage apps.
But people are buying them.
Unless you're making a massage app, who gives a crap what other massage apps are out there?
And yes, I understand that people are dumb and will...
and many more.
I don't ever get contacted by indie developers on this show, save for the ones you've already heard on this program in the past, like YYR and a couple others.
But I'm just saying, indie developers, maybe you need to aim a little lower.
Stop trying to go for the big, big coverage and come to indie shows and things like that.
I will happily have indie developers on that want to pimp their games.
Just send us an email.
You know what I mean?
There's plenty of outlets for them to do that kind of stuff.
So, alright, we'll see what happens.
DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get into the release dates and then the Classic Game of the Week?
It's not that far away either.
I love that word, fushigi.
So yeah, they have had to change the 22,000 word dictionary And it's going to be a budget release on top of that Interesting But speculation is that they're already working on localizing the sequel as well No word on if it's being changed as far as aesthetically, cosmetically
Now when you say localized, you mean they are changing as well all of the words and things to be in Japanese language.
Localizing it for Japan.
That has got to be a pain in the ass.
Oh yes, because I honestly think that there's going to have to be more universal memes there used.
What alphabet are they going to use?
I would expect that they're going to use the... What's that?
It's kanji and katakana?
I think they're going to use all of them, I would hope.
probably use the you know how iPhone with the iPhone you can actually just type it in either way and it will bring up the kanji dictionary that will let you pick which one or like using the shift just translate changer on Windows okay yeah I would expect it would work the same way I wonder if low cats are going to be in it and all the other internet memes or if they kind of took those out because maybe it's not president cat yeah they should put president cat in the game that'd be awesome yeah
but I'm not going to hold my breath let's travel around the world and look at some releases coming soon to a store near you we'll start in the US, Loki
Still keeping up with lots of releases coming out, and I think this is probably going to be the last big week, and it's going to start dying down.
Today, actually, was the release of Mario vs. Donkey Kong Miniland Mayhem on the Nintendo DS.
Also this Sunday, there was also U-Draw.
Hold on, is that that same puzzle game series that started a long time ago on the Game Boy Advance, the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games?
Yeah, the ones like Lemons.
Wow.
I never realized that was such a huge series.
Well, tell Nintendo.
They don't seem to understand.
It wasn't a bad game the first time.
It wasn't a bad game, but I mean, I could think of them developing some other games, though, that might not be so bad.
People like Mario games.
I mean, standard Mario games.
It's on like Mario.
Don't go too crazy.
Some people like myself may like Mario RPG.
Just a thought.
you draw they're coming out with the tablet plus the drawing software and then Dude's Big Adventure which is some doodling platformer game and Pictionary because everyone loves Pictionary and of course Pictionary for the DS so that's all today and then of course this week we have NBA Jam coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 for the almost full price of $50 instead of $60 okay it's $10 cheaper
Sims 3 for the Wii kind of delayed from the rest of the other console versions Marvel Super Heroes Squad the Infinity Gauntlet on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Wii I concur it's terrible it's like Marvel Super Hero Babies or something like that National Geographic Challenge Wildlife on PlayStation 3 and Wii
Pac-Man Party.
That's coming out on the Wii.
Barbie, Groom, and Glam Pups on the Wii and DS.
Is there a single listener of Orange Launch Radio that's going to be picking up Barbie, Groom, and Glam Pups?
No, but it is... Then why do we list them on the release dates?
Because they're coming out, okay?
I don't care about all of these titles.
Well, maybe it should stay in.
People go to jail over protesting cosmetic use on animals and you have a game where you have to put mascara on a dog or something.
I don't even want to know what that game involves.
You gave your cat a perm.
20 points.
That's pretty much the Chocobo game on Facebook.
Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii.
Yes, that's not confusing at all, just repeating the title because, oh yeah, it's going back to its roots, I guess.
Will that work as well as it did on Kyriek Revolution, the game that everybody forgot was even out there that you said you were going to support with download content but never did?
Namco Museum Megamix It's more Namco arcade games for the Wii Split Second on PSP this week Apache Air Assault on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and I believe PC as well We'll skip past all this crap since you don't want to talk about iCarly 2
iCarly, I believe it's I joined the clique.
I think that's what it was called.
I stabbed myself.
And then I told you, I don't know if I mentioned this last week, but Reload Target Down on the Wii.
It is a target shooting game.
That's right.
You don't actually kill real people in it.
That's terrible.
What's the point?
Yes, exactly.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon on the Wii.
Jillian Michaels' Fitness Ultimatum 2011.
God, I don't care.
Oh yeah, Dance Dance Revolution on PlayStation 3 as well with the move support.
EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp.
That's $100, by the way.
That's coming out on the Wii.
Hello Kitty Seasons.
What does that come with to justify the $100 price?
Does it come with one of those full training dummies that you slam into to try and tackle?
For your living room?
No, they actually do have, it's a set of wireless sensors.
They've got a pedometer, some sort of thing built in.
It's a bunch of sensors and whatnot.
Heart rate monitors.
For your ass.
For your ass, yes, that's right.
Because your ass has its own heart.
Nine hours, nine persons, nine doors.
That's on Nintendo DS this week.
Why'd you even ask?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1.
It's coming out on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, PC, and I believe the Xbox 360 version.
You can cast spells with the Kinect.
EA Sports Active 2.0.
That's also $100 each.
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
And on top of all that, you need the Move or Kinect.
Well, then the Wii.
You just need the Wii stuff.
That's expensive all around.
Um... Other fun stuff this week.
And there is some fun stuff.
And this is pretty awesome.
Need for Speed Hot Pursuit.
Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
And this is from Criterion.
I mean, the guys behind the Burnout series.
So you know it's going to be good.
Sonic Colors on the Wii and Nintendo DS.
Um...
and then there's this game called Create which is from EA they're trying to make it like some sort of LittleBigPlanet thing but really it's not that's on PC, Playstation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii and
and finally rounding things out here Zumba Fitness it's some Latin dance exercise thing I keep seeing infomercials for it early in the morning because I have to get up with the baby Xbox 360 Wii and Playstation 3 and of course those do support the Move and Connect DECA Sports Freedom that is a Kinect game that's based off that Wii game that they put out and then finally I'm told those DECA Sports games do really well
They do, actually, and they're not too terrible.
Remember, we played DECA Sports 1 a long time ago.
Yeah, because they had curling, which made it the best.
Figure skating.
Made it the best.
I hope they have figure skating on the Kinect.
That would be tons of fun to do in my living room.
I don't think they have figure skating, but they have some other stuff.
I could be my own Brian Boitano.
and then Pro Evolution Soccer 2011.
And that's it.
That was on the Wii, of course.
Looking in our chat room at chat.orange.com, Frisbee says, speaking of worthless, whatever happened to the vitality sensor?
Good question.
Never came out.
Okay.
Maybe that'll be the big thing in XT3.
Well, if you remember, though, Ubisoft does have their own version of that that's on PC, though.
Remember that?
I don't remember what the hell it was called, but it was just like, okay, breathe in and out.
Breathe in and out of the game.
We relax, right, or whatever?
I don't know.
It wasn't real.
Breathe the game.
I like to breathe.
All right, let's go to our Japanese release dates.
Hooray.
Call of Duty Black Ops gets a subtitle edition released in Japan this week on November 18th.
EA Sports, MMA, The Sims 3, Crossboard 7, and Dance Evolution all as well come out this week on the Xbox 360.
In fact, I think this is the big week for Kinect in Japan.
November 20th is their launch day over there, so it's about, what, six days away?
20 is an important number.
Is it?
Yes, it is.
Crossboard 7, Karada de...
Adrenaline Misfits Karada de Kitaru Ashitari no Tore Connect
Dr. Kiyosawa's brain and body training is what it's going to be coming out over here.
Wow, look at you.
Kinect Sports, Sonic Free Riders, and that's all I'm seeing for their releases out the gate.
So I don't know if it's just not as huge of a launch over there or what.
And that brain training game, it's by the guy that did Brain Age.
Very interesting that there's no localized Dance Central, so the only dance game they're going to have is Dance Masters.
Interesting.
PlayStation 3, Agarest Senkei 2 comes out in regular and limited edition.
Why are you laughing over there?
It's a record of the Agarest Wars.
Remember the breeding game?
Oh, yes.
Oh my gosh.
You play an amnesiac murderer.
You have killed a god.
To revive him, you must travel the land with three heroines and choose one of them to soul pleat.
Yeah, soul pleat.
I know what they mean by that.
Call of Duty Black Ops has a subtitle edition there as well.
A candy pink version of the DualShock 3.
Hooray.
Gekiyatsu, Pachi, Game Tamashi, Evangelion, Hajimari no Fukuin comes out this week.
More Evangelion.
Is it based on the new series?
I don't know.
It looks like a card game and it has clips from the anime in it.
Oh, is it a pachinko game or a card game?
I think it's pachinko.
Oh yeah, that looks like a pachinko game.
That part does, but I don't know.
There might be more to it.
It might be a party game or something.
Move to Party comes out as well.
That's just what?
The PlayStation Move party game, but it's cute.
Nikudan comes out this week as well from Sony in Japan.
I don't know what game this is, but it's like a fighting game that uses the move.
What is this?
That's the fight the lights out.
Is this out here already?
Yeah.
It's terrible.
Looks very hardcore.
Sims 3 also comes out this week on PlayStation 3 in Japan as well.
This is a big week for releases in Japan.
Nintendo Wii gets Sonic Colors this week.
I'm sorry, that's a US release that a lot of people in Japan are bringing over.
Oh no, it is out as well on the 18th.
It's on there twice.
Tatiate Hazumu Smash Ball Plus with a pink Wii Remote Plus.
That comes out.
That's the game that was circulating earlier.
It's coming with its Flink Smash.
Yeah, that's what it is.
Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin, and this comes with a power-up kit.
It's a price reduction of a game that was already out.
and then World Soccer Winning 11 2011 comes out on the Wii this week as well going to the handhelds real quick on the Nintendo DS there is the Pokemon Black and White DSIs are coming out very soon otherwise Sonic Colors is coming out as well as a game called Moto Stitch Rhythm de Rakugaki Daisakusen comes out from Disney this week so it must be some type of Disney rhythm game trying to load more information on that right now oh it is Stitch why did they put an extra T in his name
They have that came out over here around March.
It was a Stitch music game.
So the Stitch music game is coming out in Japan this week.
I forgot what it was called though.
And then on the Sony PSP this week, a brand new PSP bundle in black and red and white and blue.
Those all come out this week.
As well as Criminal Girls is the game that comes out this week.
I'll leave that to your imagination.
It's an RPG and it has chicks in prisoner outfits with big boobies and cop outfits in big boobies and...
Yep, lots of big boobies in that chibi anime style for your PSP.
Criminal Girls, because they've been very bad and they need to be punished.
Just like DarkSakura in the UK releases.
I don't need to be punished.
I'm a good girl.
Now I've got to find them again.
Okay.
On the 19th, a whole bunch of stuff.
We have Apache Air Assault, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Blood Drive, Create, EA Sports Active 2.0, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,
Harvest Moon Animal Parade, Harvest Moon Sunshine, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, and Prince of Persia Trilogy and Split Second Velocity, and the piece of crap Super Hero Squad.
I love Marvel, but damn.
Oh, and on the 21st Super Crate Box.
Super Crate Box or Crepe Box.
Because I was like, mmm, a crepe sounds really good right now.
I don't know about you guys, but like a crepe.
It doesn't have anything for it.
It is a Super Crate Box.
Like, isn't that redundant?
Crate Box?
Well, it's a box that you store crates in.
It makes sense.
That makes as much sense as Forklift.
They're talking about that criminal girls game in our chat room and Breakman is like, criminal girls?
I hope it's a girls prison game.
And Frisbee chimes in with, okay girls, shower time.
You guys all need to get laid.
Seriously.
Nothing wrong with that.
They're just trying to be cleanly.
So, how about that Microsoft?
How about it?
How about them?
They are suing Motorola.
Not because of some bad phone deal, but apparently they licensed some technology from Motorola.
And Motorola decided, hey, you know what?
We want more money.
And they've been charging royalties that are excessive and discriminatory, according to Microsoft.
And apparently, I guess this is regarding its video decoding and wireless LAN technology.
I guess that's incorporated into the Xbox 360.
And apparently they are going to court over it to see whether or not Microsoft does pay those excessive royalties that Motorola thinks that are deserved.
Hmm.
yay lawsuits there's always some lawsuits somebody suing somebody over something oh yeah will this change gaming as we know it or is this just kind of a cock waving competition it's just I don't think it's going to change anything it's just about right it just means that they make less money
You know, maybe if you were investing in Microsoft or Motorola that might matter to you, but probably not.
And if Microsoft loses the case, they'll just pass the expense on to the consumers.
And then the sun will continue to rise tomorrow.
Exactly.
Nice.
By the way, I don't mean to backtrack, but sometimes the chat room is a little lagged, but I'm getting some tells about the Stitch game that we were talking about before.
Stitch Jam is what it was called.
Stitch Jam, but the Japanese version of Stitch Jam.
Apparently they're liking it over there.
Famitsu's giving it a silver rating.
So just because they're based off of movies does not necessarily mean they're...
Well, yeah.
I mean, Famitsu's harsh.
At least they used to be.
Well, if you want it now, I'm sure it's dirt cheap because it's been out since March and it wasn't that hot of a seller.
In fact, it wasn't really much of a seller at all.
I wonder if it's going to do better over there than it did here.
Interesting.
Stitch is super, super popular.
That makes sense, actually.
Like, you can get, like, total... The UFO catchers, like, are just totally Stitch-loaded in some places.
Stitch is adorable, though.
Stitch is great.
All right.
Instant Action Instant Action
and DarkSakura.com
Uh, yeah, I guess there's also a comment that was made to the Kotaku website in that, uh, quote, it was an operating in a highly competitive industry and the business didn't scale profitably in the manner we had expected.
Well, unfortunately, you know, some of these things just take kind of time to build and it doesn't sound like they had a huge catalog of the streaming games.
and you know I think in order to make a splash you've got to kind of have that must-have game that's available through your technology and unfortunately Monkey Island as good of a game as it was just wasn't it because it had already been out for a little while and I think most people that wanted to play it probably already did so bummer hopefully those guys that were able to land on their feet again in new positions somewhere very soon or maybe that whole torque powered thing will work out who knows
Anyhow, it's now time for the part of our show where we will take a trip down memory lane
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Rob's text to me was, I have to read this because this is funny.
Hold on, where is it?
I just lulled.
I did.
When I said I'd put it out.
Well, tell us what it is already.
I can't stand the suspense.
Paradise.
And I picked the long version of my favorite song from that one.
Tell me you don't want to shake your butt to this.
One, two, three, two, three, two, one.
Tokyo!
Those chicks can't count.
Eh, they use different numbers in Japan.
Okay, Para Para Paradise, which was made by Konami, and it is a Domani game, and it's for para para dancing!
It uses a motion sensor controller that's in an octagonal platform shape and has five directional sensors that lets you, where it is, you've got power power mode where you do all the set actual routines for the songs and freestyle mode where you can dance around however you want to as long as you hit them or like Iguana Girl does, goth dance.
I've seen all sorts of creative interpretations to the dancing in this game.
It's pretty awesome.
I've seen people just use their pelvis, actually, to activate the arrows.
Yes, it is.
I've seen people do it with just their legs.
Pretending they have their penis out.
Or, in some cases, in the privacy of their own home, not pretending.
If you've got the pink biscuits, then you do.
Well, there were different versions.
There was, of course, the first mix, and then there was the second mix that had the actual models dancing along with you mirrored so that you could see them.
And it even had a learn the para mode, learn the dance mode, which that's how I learned a few of them was playing that.
I think Stockton Goffland still has theirs.
I need to get back there.
Um, yeah, it was super fun.
It had, um, uh, for the, uh, U.S.
Oh, not U.S., what am I saying?
We never got it over here.
For the, uh, home version, it had, um, actual, uh, dancers that you could play in mirrored mode, or it had it in the corner.
You could watch, learn it, too.
Which is what Dance Masters is now.
Yeah.
Well, Dance Masters is, it defaults mirrored.
So, that's pretty cool.
Um...
It basically, it was really neat, I thought, because it was something, now, I'll tell you what, I had actually just heard about Parapara dancing right about the same time the game came out, and then I saw pictures of people playing, I was like, they're doing those little dances!
The first time we ever met was over at Power, Power, Paradise.
Yes, it was.
And that was, I learned like half of Eurobeat, that particular song.
Your song's over, so I'm going to play one of mine.
Okay.
It's in Dance Masters, actually.
Like a Virgin?
No, where, oh, these are all people playing the stupid game.
No, I do love that song, though.
Let me see if I can find that.
It's by Virginelle, I think.
God, how do I know this?
Well, and also one of our listeners has been kind of hooking me up with lots and lots and lots of Super Eurobeat CDs and Dance Manias and stuff.
I've been quite the pleased little fangirl.
But yeah, I mean, and the other thing with the whole Parapara genre is that it really came up with the whole Gyaru Saba.
Oh, you found it?
Was I right?
Huh.
Sorry, I just wanted the bones in there.
It was really attached very strongly to the Gyaru subculture too, which is actually still going on.
You know, 10 plus you're strong.
But it doesn't necessarily mean that they all para para and go to clubs.
Velfar, the song that, the first song, got Rob sitting in his chair doing the damn dance.
And, uh, but, uh, the club- I can't believe I remember this.
I feel so gay right now.
But the big Parapara club, Belfar, that that song was made for, since it's gone out of business, I think, or it's turned into a different place.
But yeah, I mean, there were all kinds of Avex tracks, songs like Belfar 2000, Anniversary, Boom Boom Fire, some of the J-Euro tracks, which my favorite was Deluxe, because that was the one where you shook your butt really a lot.
Rob's back to doing the dance again.
but there was a Korean version called Parapara Dancing that was pretty much mostly Korean music like it had BoA and SES and it had a version of Hold On Me done in Korean and it said that you could I guess play front to back and it had some in the back so you could face instead of facing the machine you could face the crowd so you could dance to them
And by the way, Rob was looking at the video that I have been watching to relearn the dances.
This is not a playthrough.
It's a little piggy crying wee wee wee.
Stupid advertisements.
I'll talk over it.
Alright.
Then there was an open source one.
Stepmania had support for Power of Paradise.
And then there's one called Power of Star.
That's a Stepmania 4.0 modification.
You can get it at Club Power of Star.
If you just look up their website.
Um...
Then, uh, they're actually, the main developers are trying to, uh, crack it.
They've gotten pretty far with it.
They've gotten through the test menu, but they can't operate it since they can't find the input ports.
And there you have it.
Rob, you gonna turn this one up?
I can't.
It's not playing.
There we go.
There we go.
This is in Dance Masters.
Did you mention the Dreamcast one?
Dreamcast Dreampara
I actually was just wrong because it wouldn't be a neon green, it would be a dark green.
It would be the opposite of hot pink.
Anyway, that's a different story.
That's me going into color theory, sorry.
I'm just staring at this girl, she's so adorable.
You should watch her one for Velfar, because she's absolutely even more adorable.
She does the little happy pose.
So how is it detecting what she's doing?
Is it like a semicircle on the floor that she's standing in?
Well, she's actually just doing the dance.
But in the game, it has five sensors.
There's one to each side, one diagonally on each side, and then one in front of you.
So when you do your hand waving, it'll, it'll fit.
And it'll even, it doesn't necessarily register your height of where your hands are, it just measures that they're in the right position.
So.
Good times.
Yep, so it's para para paradise.
Your classic game of the week, para para paradise.
Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Old favorite from back in the Bomani fandom days.
Although I'm still a fan of Bomani, you know, back when it was good.
All right.
Anyhow, that's going to do it for part A. But hey, we have plenty more show to come.
Don't go anywhere.
When we come back, we're going to talk plenty more.
We have a lot of quick, quick news tonight.
Things about like Yars' Revenge, more Facebook games, Lame Castle, Naughty Bear 2, believe it or not.
We're going to talk about Black Ops a little bit.
I know it's not usually the type of game we get into on the show, but it's broken sales records.
We have to say something about it.
And talk a little bit about maybe a change in how to price games.
That would be nice, wouldn't it?
So we'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere.
We'll be back right after this.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live on November the 14th of 2010 here for the 389th episode of our show.
Join us in our chat room if you are listening live because we do tape live every week Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
You can join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where some of the chatters were reacting to the music that we were playing during the break.
Some loved it, some hated it.
I guess we'll start off with Loki.
Yes, some rapid fire news here.
We've got news that... I don't know if this is too exciting.
I liked at least one of these games.
Wet 2 and Naughty Bear 2 are confirmed in development at Behavior.
Wet was kind of cool.
It was sort of supposed to be like a punk rock-ish...
Action Game.
I thought it was alright.
Naughty Bear 2 wasn't all that great.
Naughty Bear 2 was one of those things that looked great on paper.
Yeah, Naughty Bear, it was just kind of didn't do very well.
Well, it also just got raped by the critics.
And it's not for lack of reason.
It was kind of crap.
I'd actually like to go back and play Wet because I think that'd be pretty cool.
Naughty Bear 2, I really don't need to work on that.
Whatever.
This is kind of neat, I guess, if you're into the whole social gaming stuff.
Kinect Sports has an app now on Facebook.
and it'll allow you to actually track your players' league results and allow them to issue invitations to have others be invited.
And also, I guess, video highlights from the game.
I haven't played the game yet, so I guess it takes video of you.
And, of course, videos won't be shown unless you go ahead and give it the okay to do so.
But, yeah.
Yeah, that is available now on Facebook.
So if you want to check it out, go to apps.facebook.com.
Do you own Kinect Sports?
I do.
What do you think?
I haven't played it.
Like I just said, I haven't played it yet.
I'm sorry.
I don't have a lot of time.
And, you know, honestly, when it's like, well, I could try Kinect Sports.
or I could play Dance Central.
I saw like five seconds of it in a store, an electronic store where they had it on demo and the bowling game was up and it looked cute.
You know, that reminds me.
Since I went to Burger King before I came over here.
Plug, plug.
By the way, I had three of the buck doubles.
I stacked them onto a six patty burger and proceeded to eat that, which is slightly...
Better for me than eating the three burgers because I didn't eat all the buns to go along with it.
Slightly better.
That's eating three quarters of the carton of ice cream instead of the whole carton.
It was good for you.
But anyways, I just thought I'd mention for the Sacramento area listeners, actually, it's funny enough, this week the Connect Tour that Microsoft is doing is actually coming to the Burger King that I went to to get my food.
which would be on 7760 Sunrise Boulevard, Citrus Heights.
They're going to be there November 17th and 18th from 10.30 to 7.30 p.m.
So if you want to go check out some of the stuff and maybe get some swag.
Yeah, it's literally up the street from here.
You can go ahead and do that there.
Or xbox.com slash Burger King if you want to know those dates later on.
But yeah, that's later this week.
It's kind of cool.
Yeah, so if you're interested, like I said, if you're into social gaming, honestly, I would never use this because I hate when people do that kind of stuff.
Maybe I'm just not the right person for that kind of thing.
Finally, this is kind of cool.
Apparently, there is the PSP commercial where they were dissing, I guess, gaming on phones and whatnot, and they had a game called Lame Castle that was in this PSP commercial.
Lame Castle Lame Castle
Well, they're getting free advertising.
I mean, why not?
All right.
Some other news going on in the gaming world real quick here.
A little bit of a WoW story, but this is big enough to report on here.
There's now a dial-in Battle.net authenticator.
You know how WoW accounts are very prone to getting hacked sometimes by shady people?
Well, authenticators have been something that Blizzard's really been pushing, and if you have an iPhone or a Droid or really any mobile phone capable of running apps, you can get a free authenticator.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's basically a phone number that you can call.
It's an 800 number.
And any time that the game detects suspicious activity, the game will call you and give you a password to put in.
You basically give it a phone number.
You call this number.
I haven't used it myself.
But it's kind of interesting.
It's a standby telephone-based way of verifying you.
Again, you only have to use it when it detects suspicious activity.
Then, I guess, basically that the logins are coming from a foreign country.
So kind of interesting that they've put that as a solution as well.
Yars Revenge is on its way.
Also, by the way, Asteroid, Star Raiders, and Centipede are all supposed to be getting remakes within the next year.
Those are already previously announced.
Didn't they do that stuff?
I know they've done Asteroid remakes, and they haven't been that good.
Some of the remakes are really hit and miss.
I think back, though, remember when they redid Pong on the PlayStation 1?
That was actually kind of a cool game, at least back in the PS1 game.
And I guess Tempest 2000 or whatever was supposed to be...
As far as recent remakes, though, I don't know.
I didn't play the Haunted House one, but I have zero interest in it.
But if the Ars Revenge one's any good, I'll check it out.
Why not?
Anyhow, one other news story for you guys.
This is about a game that has come out of RPG Maker 2003.
It's called Marvel Brothel.
Yes, it is a sex RPG...
Magneto says to stop it.
This is a retarded and stupid idea.
Do you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad?
DarkSakura
Well, in other news, for those of us who are mobile phone gamers, Splatterhouse is coming out.
Splatterhouse is cool.
Namco is going to be doing a release of Splatterhouse on November 23rd.
And, yeah, Splatterhouse.
We also have Angry Birds, which is a game that I just heard of and downloaded yesterday.
Because my husband's aunt is addicted to it.
It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and WiiWare.
And there's going to be a sequel.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's better than fart apps.
Someone on the BART train that I rode up here was playing Three Angry Birds right next to me and I just wanted to smack it out of his hand.
Why all the hate?
I played it on the iPad when you got your iPhone 4 and I got to the third level and I don't get it.
It's kind of stupid.
I didn't like it.
Well, now you can play it on Xbox Live Arcade or not or you can make fun of it there.
Yes.
There you go.
But you won't be using your fingers to do it.
No.
No.
No.
Anything else, DarkSakura, before we get to Twitter topics?
Yes.
Rock band releases.
Ooh.
The Bee Gees.
The Bee Gees are awesome.
Yeah.
Look at that hair.
Actually, that particular image is the same image that was used on the back cover of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.
And you know how I know this?
I had two versions of it on vinyl.
A double LP version.
The guy in the middle looks kind of like Jesus.
You can't deny that.
I'm going to post this in the chat room.
He's Disco Jesus.
Yeah, he's Disco Jesus.
But you know, I actually do like the Bee Gees.
But anyway, there's going to be A Whiter Shade of Pale by Procol Harum and The Thrill is Gone, B.B.
King.
That's always cool.
The Bee Gees Pack is going to have Jive Talkin', Night Fever, Stayin' Alive, Nights on Broadway, Tragedy, and You Should Be Dancing.
The first three and the last one were all on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.
You should be dancing, yeah.
Tragedy is the name of a heavy metal Bee Gees cover band.
Because I've played some of them on the show before.
Wow.
and there's also a couple of them which is Stayin' Alive and The Thrill Is Gone have pro guitar bass expansions for 80 Microsoft points.
You gotta have the Stayin' Alive with the pro expansions.
Awesome.
I remember this picture very vividly because, like I said, I grew up with both copies of this album and played them until they skipped.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Stayin' Alive Headbands and short shorts Headbands and leg warmers Roller skates
tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
I guess DarkSakura's just going to have to sing it tonight.
Didn't this happen last week with Twitter music?
Oh, there it is.
There it is.
We're saved.
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.
Going on to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
Let's get into a tweet here from PotCulture who's going to start us off tonight.
Don't know if you guys discussed it before, but I just found an Android and iOS mobile MMO game called Pocket Legends.
Game Center Game Center Game Center Game Center
Not something I'd play long term but for a free diversion when you're sitting on the toilet.
Good times.
You totally reminded me of a shirt I want to get.
What's that?
It says, iPhone changed the way I use the bathroom.
There you go.
Moving on to Actdeft sends us a tweet.
Sly 4 is being teased in the Sly collection for the PS3.
I guess there's actually a little teaser trailer thingy on the PS3 that is teasing a new Sly game.
But I mean, if there were three others and they've all been doing well, the Necessitated collection, is this really a surprise to anybody?
But it's nice to have it somewhat officially confirmed.
Redertainment says this is a tweet.
Boxy!
Overpriced oddly shaped box or over fucking priced oddly shaped piece of shit.
I've never heard... What is... Boxy?
What is that?
Does anyone know what that is?
I think it's a streaming device
It's $199.
The price is Apple TV.
Isn't Apple TV only $99 now?
Really?
Actually, Boxee puts a little comparison right there.
They're saying there's more than there is to iTunes.
There's twice the HD and Boxee plays more file formats.
Don't the new TiVos have a lot of internet integration in it now?
If you want Hulu Plus, you can get it on TiVo, I think.
I have a way around that.
I have a computer hooked up to my television.
I would say, honestly, before you spend the money on this, I mean, I guess if you really want something like this, yay.
But if you already have a PlayStation or Xbox 360, look into the streaming alternatives you have on there.
or spend like $300 on a cheap-ass laptop and use that and then you can actually take the cheap-ass laptop with you.
Or you can build yourself a micro for like, what, $200?
I guess it depends on your budget, sir.
Our computer that we have in the front room was leftovers.
And now it's our internet computer for the front room so that Dan can watch Top Gear.
You can get a PC that can stream stuff off the internet or play stuff for under $100.
Our buddy SSJ100Matt is sending us a pair of tweets here.
I'll read these real quickly.
One of them has to do with Gal Gun.
I guess Gal Gun is having a fight with Microsoft over panties because apparently the official Gal Gun site is down.
I guess Gal Gun was supposed to be out on January 27th, but they're having some problems with Microsoft.
There's negotiations over the moral issues about the game.
Microsoft is objecting to the content in the shooter.
I don't think this is a game that's ever going to come out over here anyway, just because of what it is.
So, enjoy.
and DarkSakura.com.
Unless you're a PlayStation Plus member, then it's free.
But apparently it's very similar to MLB TV, which also came out earlier on the PS3 this year.
And if you subscribe to Game Center Live, which is $169 annually, you get all of these features.
You stream live out-of-market games, select playoff broadcasts,
But what's cool is that it looks like the scoreboard kind of comes up live on your TV And you can kind of use the controllers to switch events and stuff Kind of looks like a neat way to watch live sporting events I like this whole like interactive stuff Kind of cool So yeah, maybe I don't watch every sports game that's out there But I think this kind of technology is neat It's going to change the way we watch television forever
TheSag is sending us a tweet.
You might remember he was here a few weeks ago and he was talking about Umlaut and he wanted us to mention that now they've got a Pac-Man eBay auction that's going on at Umlaut.
Y'all a fan of Pac-Man?
Well, here's the deal.
They're actually going to be auctioning off at Umlaut.
Actually, no, I'm sorry.
It's going to be on eBay right now.
Pac-Man for the Famicom
So, very cool.
Currently going for how much?
Right now it's up to $565, but it's autographed by the creator of Pac-Man.
That's pretty awesome.
More information available at umlaut.org That's just in a couple weeks.
I can't believe it's right around the corner.
Can you believe it?
Crazy stuff.
Let's see.
Also on the tweets.
Going to DarkTetsuya.
As if Naked Dance Central weren't enough, someone did this.
I'm almost afraid to click this link here.
Good God.
It's probably the IGN Naked story.
No, it's the nuts.
Not safe for work, two naked girls playing Kinect.
It's topless.
Oh, then I want to see this.
Let's see.
June 26th, 19... 32!
Sponsor message?
What's this bullshit?
Shut up!
Here we go.
Oh yes, I see boobies.
Is it sad that I recognize which song they were playing and not which difficulty in Dance Central?
You can tell who's fake and who's not.
Actually, I think they're both fake.
They're both fake.
This makes for great radio.
We're looking at two topless chicks in studio right now.
They're playing Lady Gaga on Easy.
Oh, God, they are, aren't they?
Yeah.
That is sad that you recognize that.
It is very sad.
I think she has nice boobies.
But they're fake.
They don't move right.
What do you think, Alan?
Do you like the boobies?
He's refusing to comment.
If OLR and Howard Stern were to ever overlap, this is as far as it gets.
Except he would have them in studio doing it in front of him.
Well, we're low budget.
I like this link from Tigerclaw.
Sends us this link to a story here.
Reggie is wondering where the Metroid Other M sales went wrong.
Here's a quote.
Chew on this for a minute.
From Reggie Fils-Aimé.
We believe that it could be, should be, a million unit title.
We're not going to get there, not through the holiday.
And we are doing a lot of thinking as to why, because it's a great game.
The consumer reaction because of the quality has been strong.
I think the marketing was strong, advertising was very good, the social media we did was very positive.
Yeah, and the story is crap.
Why is that?
So it kind of just sounds like they just, like, IDK, LOL.
Like, they're like, it's a good game.
They don't get at all why it didn't.
People actually care about the characterization.
Yeah.
I honestly think it more has to do with the fact that people are kind of, like, the hardcore gamers are kind of over the Wii.
Like, I get that this was a game to kind of throw a bone at the hardcore gamers, but I think it was kind of too late.
They've moved on a while ago.
I think there's a lot of people like me who have put their Wii in a box.
We in a box.
It's my we in a box.
We're 12.
Should I bring out the boobie video again?
All right.
I think you got a few more messages.
Hold on.
I got another one here from another one from Tiger Claw.
See, you know what's funny is that Tigerclaw actually sent us like five tweets.
No, wait, four.
But what happened is that the other two were stories we covered a minute ago.
So he was like, oh, I know they're not going to read those.
So I'm going to send new tweets.
Tigerclaw is working the Twitters.
He has the system down.
But I'll allow it.
Anyhow, let's see, Tiger Claw also sends us this.
Oh, the WE patent infringement investigation.
The International Trade Commission is going to be moving forward looking at this, that the WE system is actually infringing on patents held by Motiva.
Have you never heard of them?
They're in Ohio.
Well, anyhow, they're going to complete their investigation by March 5th, 2012.
There will be an initial determination on the matter by November 4th, 2011.
Yeah, by that time, I'm sure the new Wii will be announced.
2012.
Well, we'll see.
I don't know.
Maybe not.
It'll be called the what?
The what?
The what?
So there you go.
And by the way, just for historical purposes, Nintendo did win an appeal of a 2008 decision where they were supposed to pay $21 million to Anescape over the WaveBird wireless controller.
So Nintendo has a good track record on these cases.
We'll see.
Oh, it looks like ShermieOLR has been tweeting us here.
ShermieOLR sent us a tweet that says Rob's feet smell funny.
Thanks for that.
I appreciate that, DarkSakura.
Tell Shermie.
She's the one who sent it telepathically to my brain that made it up.
Whatever.
Whatever.
She's got to sit there and smell your feet all during the show.
Trick or treat.
Smell my feet.
She's a very patient little girl.
Alright.
I don't know if we are still streaming because our Winamp is frozen here on our side.
So we're going to just ride it out and see what happens.
We're going to keep taping for podcasts, so let's keep moving.
We'll get into some more gaming news.
That's it for the Twitters tonight.
Thank you guys.
Are we disconnected right now?
Okay, I will... Okay, I'll reconnect us, guys.
Alright, got it.
Live radio happens.
Let's keep moving.
Just get into the next story.
I'll restart the stream.
Okay.
Let's see.
Well, this is kind of interesting.
Well, not too surprising, but Black Ops sold a lot, I guess.
Uh-huh.
They are now calling it the largest entertainment launch in history.
It sold 5.6 million units in the US and the UK and grossed $360 million in sales for the first 24 hours.
and apparently you want to compare that to last year's where it was 4.7 million units during the launch for Modern Warfare 2 so quite an increase from last year and of course to go along with that Activision is saying that Call of Duty's download content will be the largest digital offering ever
Alright, sorry to interrupt, but thanks to the live drama going on.
Okay, so here's what happened.
Our show went down for whatever reason.
We had an internet clog or whatever.
So we all get kicked from the chat room and then we all rejoin it while our ghosts are in there.
We've just been banned from the chat network, but at least our feed's back up and running.
But unfortunately, we're not in chat.
I'll hop in chat in an hour.
I can get you on IRC real quick if you want to switch places.
What do you think?
Why do you think this game is doing so phenomenally well?
Actually, this is what I wanted to chew on a little bit here.
Wasn't there supposed to be this whole backlash because of the Infinity Ward stuff that happened, which I think everyone had agreed was kind of fucked up?
Wasn't there supposed to be this huge backlash against the game that didn't really end up happening, or what?
Yeah, probably pretty similar to the backlash that was supposed to happen with...
Left 4 Dead 2, remember?
I don't know.
Why do you think games like these are doing extremely well?
What is it about this genre of video game that really attracts people, you think?
People like their first-person shooters, and especially something that has such a strong online component to it.
That's why they're all over games like Halo Reach and Modern Warfare 2 and, of course, Black Ops and whatnot.
Especially more realistic shooters that have real military weapons in them and stuff.
It's the perfect storm, I guess.
but it's funny though because even though it's a Treyarch game usually it's like oh Treyarch Call of Duty but yet they still buy it and lots of it is it just the name that's attached to it or what's the deal I think franchise definitely helps but yeah it's just funny interesting
It's gamesurge.net Sorry, we're trying to work on technical difficulties here.
irc.gamesurge.net But that is the IRC network we're on.
If you want to join us, if you don't for whatever reason want to connect to our website at chat.orangeonestradio.com You could be uncool and not go in our chat room.
I know.
All the cool kids are there except us.
Well, how about something else in news?
Sure.
Rob, I think this might make you roll your eyes and go, what?
Okay.
UK retailers are deciding that they don't like Steam.
They actually are going to try to boycott Steam effectively.
One of them is quoted as saying, if we have a digital service and I don't want to start selling...
and a rival in store.
So basically they're saying that not only are you competing with your product in the store, but you've got rivals in there as well that could be taking your market and you can do a side-by-side comparison for price.
Took them long enough to realize this, by the way.
Yeah.
Well, and that's the same thing that was going on with Apple and now it's going to be going on with Steam.
Although, honestly, from a consumer point of view, I love Steam.
I do too because of all the sales they always do on there.
It's great.
And pre-orders and getting to play Join Trill.
I mean, I didn't say that, did I?
Hey, I'm back in chat.
Hooray.
Thank you, Alan, for hooking that up.
Chat.OrangeHunter.com.
Actdeft says, UK retailers equals stupid.
So damn stupid.
I don't know though I mean if I were a retailer and you know I'm practically selling this program that is going to install a store that makes it easier to take sales away from me I don't know I think they have a right to not sell it I mean it's a tricky line to balance though it's up to them but honestly I mean they're going between the easy sale and market profit whatever to the what's going to be better for them in the long term and I don't even know that that's still going to be good for them in the long term
GameGuru in our chatroom says, so they aren't going to sell Civ V and Call of Duty?
That's a good point.
I mean, such huge releases included, it's hard to not have it, you know what I mean?
And honestly, I think that Steam would facilitate more sales, at least in those big titles.
But I can see smaller developers maybe... Well, honestly, though, it's still a friend of smaller developers, too, because they come up as budget games.
So, I'm just saying.
All right.
Well, anyhow, let me talk about a new sales model that's out there from THQ.
Apparently, they've decided that $39.99 is the place to be.
Hey, this doesn't sound so bad, although careful, there might be kind of a but here.
Here's the deal.
This is a quote from the Capital Markets Conference from THQ President Brian Farrell.
Quote,
so the thinking at this time is let's initially launch at $39.99 it's a AAA title at that price point but then with a series of DLC so people can extend their experience hmm isn't THQ also one of those companies that does the $10 online thing?
yes but doesn't that seem to sting a lot less when they're only charging $40 for the game to begin with?
well $10 online is only if you buy the game used true true
Well, I mean, I'm liking this idea of the fact that maybe the game will only cost $40, you know?
It's a nice idea.
We've heard a lot about this kind of stuff, though, is that games tend to sell, I mean, this is kind of a duh, but some games, I should say, have really sold better after a price reduction, right?
Yeah.
Like DJ Hero was an example.
We had the first DJ Hero game, didn't sell too hot for a few, but then they cut the price and it sells a lot.
Interesting, huh?
That could be interesting if it starts this new trend, although, I don't know, they have to make back their money, but I think the guy makes a good point.
If you have more users, even if it's a lower price, you still end up making the same amount of money, right?
Maybe even more.
Well, and they're saying more opportunity for DLC, because if you have...
2 users are willing to buy the game for $39.99 versus 1 person that wants to buy it for $59.99 then you have the opportunity to sell 2 $10 DLCs or multiple $10 DLCs
Good point.
Ooh, Robert M has a really good comment in our chatroom at chat.orange.com Would the original Katamari have been as successful at more than $20?
Good point.
That's what really drove sales of that first game was the fact that it was a $20 game and everybody was like, you've got to get this Katamari game.
It's only $20.
It's awesome.
But if it had been a $50 game or whatever they were charging at the time, would it have been as exciting?
I don't know.
Hmm.
So anyhow, Loki, what do you have for us?
Ah, yes.
So there's more fun stuff we can talk about, and this is more THQ-related things.
I don't know if I should be excited or disappointed that they're planning on doing this, but Saints Row apparently is going to become a movie, according to THQ.
They're going to be announcing it next month, although they've just announced it, I don't know, I guess officially announced it.
So they've announced that an announcement is coming.
um yes and so apparently I guess they're gonna have uh some sort of movie um coming out I think it's gonna be kind of cool cause you know Saints Row unlike Grand Theft Auto it does have like a single storyline that goes along um whereas Grand Theft Auto is kind of all over the place so it could work perhaps I definitely think that they should get the people that did the voice acting for the game you know kind of in there so uh
That would be kind of cool.
I'd probably go see it.
What would you want to see most in a Saints Row movie?
How about a good plot?
A musical.
A good plot would be nice.
Nudity.
Nudity would be fine.
Random glitches.
It could be interesting.
I don't know.
I would like to see just some of the main characters that they have in the game make a return.
We too.
and how it really isn't necessarily going to happen in 2011.
But is that just because they really aren't going to announce one in 2011 or because they just don't want to cannibalize sales here in 2010?
And there was a bit of talk with Reggie Fils-Aimé and let me read you some of the quotes here because Kotaku actually kind of asked Reggie about this and said, "'We Too' is not a must for next holiday?"
And he said, "'No.'"
But you sort of expect that that answer's coming because when you announce the "'We Too' then people are going to stop buying the Wii.'"
Reggie did say, by the way, that the Wii's sales have peaked in the system's third year.
There are more than 30 million Wiis out there right now.
He also has these charts and things that show that the Wii is selling now faster than the PlayStation 2 was at the same point in time.
23% faster, if you want to be exact.
Hmm.
So anyhow, the Wii 2 might come in Christmas 2011, but it's all speculation right now.
Of course, Nintendo's really going to be behind the 3DS next year, we know that.
One interesting other note that Reggie did leave the interview on, as we sit here today, we're saying the Wii has many, many more units to sell.
After we've reached an install base of 45 million units in the US, then we can have a conversation about the next generation.
Hmm.
I guess we can see kind of where their goals are at.
But I don't know, what do you guys think?
Do they need to announce a Wii 2 next year?
It prints money!
They don't need a new Wii Lease.
Wii Rease.
They need a system that's better.
I think this is funny because to me, this and the whole why isn't Metroid selling thing go hand in hand to me.
And I think the next Wii, one thing Nintendo does pretty well these days is the backwards compatibility thing.
The next Wii will be like a Super Wii.
It's going to be a Wii that runs on HD and it uses all the same stuff.
You know what?
No, this is my thing.
With that comment and everything, the why isn't this selling, it's not really that he's being that dumb.
It's trying to talk it up so that people will go out and buy it.
I mean, it's just more, we believe in our product, we stand behind it, even though they may be sitting in a boardroom going, what the hell were they thinking when they wrote the story for this game?
How can you people be so stupid to not buy this amazing video game?
Exactly.
Going to our chat at chat.orangeslaunchradio.com Casey says, so now they're treating their home consoles like they're handhelds with the replacing them with a new version of the same thing.
Well, there was all that talk that the Wii was just a souped up GameCube, but at the same time, the Wii is the most successful console ever.
Per sales.
I mean, as much as we sit here and give it a hard time, and as much as you might roll your eyes at games like Metroid Other M, money is what money is.
Let's see.
Also, saying this, GameGuru in our chat room says, they want 3DS to have this Christmas and save Wii 2 for 2012.
I think 3DS for this Christmas, meaning really Christmas 2011.
And that could very well be the case.
I think the 3DS will really be where it's at next year.
And it'll print money!
Right, Salacious Pulp?
It'll print money.
Yes.
All right.
Let's go to the email bag.
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is where you send your emails every week.
DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag headfirst and pull out some of her favorite emails and read them for you right now.
One of them, I'm not going to read the email, but in regards to the contest to get the code for Symphony of the Night for Xbox Live Arcade,
I said specifically not Orange Lounge Radio.
Who is it that is He Who Shall Not Be Named on Comic Insanity?
It's called Cross Promotion.
As in you kind of got to go listen to both podcasts if you're going to win.
So, no.
Yes, ma'am.
You're automatically disqualified for not following the rules.
I don't know.
I might give you another chance.
I heard the story about GameStop that had the Call of Duty Black Ops I shop at that store, but the story confuses me
Why would this particular robbery about my little town make all of the game blogs?
The only thing I can think of is that it promotes Call of Duty.
So the story, by making the rounds, is inadvertently condoning the robbery for the sake of advertisement.
The store is actually pretty nice and in a nice area.
It's odd that it was robbed.
The highways allow for a very quick trip to I-95 and probably made it to the street vendors in New York City and D.C.
by Sunday.
Later, RobbaBuh.
I can actually think of a lot of answers to the questions.
Why was it so important?
Well, it probably wasn't in the scope of things, but think about it made the news for the same reason that all these murders that involve fights over Xbox controllers and stuff make news.
I mean, it just kind of remotely has to do with video games and so people talk about it.
Also, it was probably all over the place because you said it happened in a place you didn't expect it to happen.
and when these sorts of things happens in places where you know you kind of go wow really it happens there people setting fire people talk in the back of a GameStop slash Macy's exactly in Roseville and you can still see the broken roof
And because that was like a super nice mall, if that had happened at Floor and Mall, it would have been just like, oh, Sunday.
Seriously.
But, well, I mean, I worked at GNC and got held up at gunpoint.
This guy was going around and hitting GNCs.
Random.
It was my first job when I moved out here.
Uh-huh.
So, I was like, dude, you suck.
Those giant tubs of Bolt Gainer 4000 are like 60 bucks a...
Well, on top of that, the moron came after I had done a deposit in the safe.
And, yeah, I could get into the safe, but I just said, dude, we've got a safe, I can't get into it.
It's on time lock.
I can't get in, yeah.
When I'm in panic mode, I either will go completely crazy or completely calm.
And I went completely calm, and so I could write down the make of his gun, what he looked like.
I drew the guy for the cops.
It was kind of fun.
That's awesome.
And they caught him.
Good times.
Like, what idiot robs a GNC?
It's the same thing as what idiot robs a GameStop in a nice area.
Anyway.
What idiot burns down a GameStop in a nice mall?
Oh, this guy was on the drugs.
Well, and every news station in the entirety of Northern California and CNN, probably.
This one person on his Facebook, his friend of his says, dude, you were stupid on his Facebook.
There's a guy that I was sitting next to in my magazine thing, went to high school with him.
Oh, how random.
Yeah.
Okay, next one.
Just to ask an actually intelligent question for a change, with the latest incarnations of these games reasonably recently published, what do you think was the most influential for defining the console first-person genre, Halo or Goldeneye?
Or, as the giant bomb guys were discussing, Call of Duty 4 for its multiplayer structure, or none of the above?
Thanks as always, Robert M. I'm going to say Goldeneye right off the bat, and Goldeneye did have multiplayer.
Slow down for me.
The question is, console first-person shooter the most impactful on consoles?
What was more influential for defining the console first-person genre?
Halo or Goldeneye or Call of Duty 4?
I would say Halo 2 because of online Xbox Live and I think that really set the stage for everything after it was Xbox Live not the original Halo didn't have Xbox Live but Halo 2 I think was Xbox Live I still say Duke Nukem 3D but then when I go influential first person shooters honestly I go back to PC games because my mind says but but but but but
Quake and Half-Life and Doom and Wolfenstein 3D really.
Quake 3 was out on Dreamcast with internet play.
Huh, interesting.
Still though, not quite the impact I think of a Halo 2 on Xbox Live.
But Halo was by no means the first.
No, oh no.
I'm sorry, Wolfenstein 3D was on Super Nintendo.
But in the US, the Satellaview thing never went through.
But I'm going for talking about online play on a console.
And I don't really think there were first-person shooters like that that played through the Satellaview or through the Genesis Link.
But for Dreamcast, Quake 3 was like the big modem game that you played.
PSO didn't work on the US one most first person shooters that ended up on console were usually ports that came from the PC first sold a couple million copies and then okay now there's a console version where they tweak the controls GoldenEye is the first one that was relevant for consoles where it was a console exclusive and because we've gone into the whole fight before about how I only play first person shooters on
A PC because I need a keyboard and mouse.
When Goldeneye came out, I was like, okay, this is on console.
I'm going to sit and figure out how to play this game because it's awesome.
So I think Goldeneye is really the first one that made console first-person shooters stand out.
I gotta give this one a shout out though, even though the game was kind of crap.
It was a really early type of first person game called Faceball 2000.
Does anyone remember this one?
Yes, I remember Faceball 2000.
It was a Game Boy game, I believe, and they had it on Super Nintendo.
And it was the whole like, it was a very rudimentary shooter game.
I only throw that out there not because necessarily it was a great game, but because it was kind of the first type of maze shoot your opponents type of thing that was only on consoles.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, and one more first person type of game, even though it was a multiplayer, Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo in all its surround sound glory because those first person shooter phases scared the crap out of me.
What if Velociraptor would run up behind you in all his pixelated open mouth glory?
I love that voice.
You sound like Chewbacca.
So there you go.
There's a variety of first-person shooter games for you.
I think all of those have had impact in different ways.
Was that it for emails?
No.
Oh.
Well, then what's next?
Jeez, Rob, just assuming, huh?
Well.
Ignoring our poor listeners.
Well.
Dear OLR.
Dear listener.
I was listening to episode 388, and while listening to your discussion of the recently announced delay of Chinese democracy, I was mortified by the derision I heard.
Sure, Chinese democracy was supposed to be a PS3 launch game, and sure, Chinese democracy is toted as the best racing game of all time, but how does any of that change with another delay?
Oh, I see what you're doing.
Yes.
Chinese democracy is like a girlfriend you have that unexpectedly moves to India.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I will go one step further when Chinese Democracy is released this year.
Not if, but when.
I will buy each and every person in the All Games community a bottle of Dr. Pepper.
Nasty.
Hey, I like Dr. Pepper.
You're welcome to it.
I am that confident in Chinese Democracy coming out this year.
Stay black, Redertainment.
There's a note.
Offer valid only to residents of the continuous... I think it means continental...
United States, and contingent on Loki wearing the Tingle costume.
Oops.
But he didn't say Tingle, he said Tinkle.
Tinkle.
So I don't think they were going to dress him up in yellow foil.
First off, I see what you did there.
Second off, you know what's funny?
And this is so true.
I get what you're trying to parallel.
And if you didn't pick up on it, obviously it's the Gran Turismo 5 thing, right?
But here's the funny thing that I think takes your parallel one step further.
When Chinese democracy finally came out, no one cared anymore.
Just saying.
Well, I will say this.
It is going to be this year from what I understand.
And no one cares anymore.
No, actually, that's wrong.
Because Dan and his cousin were just talking about it yesterday.
Two people care anymore.
Just kidding.
And we're talking about other people asking about it.
Fine, fine, fine.
People do still care.
I don't think as many as would have cared two years ago.
But we'll see.
Sales will be where it is all at.
Now is the part of the show where we get angsty and rude and mad because, well, we can.
I'm giving a fork you to the culinary department at my school for, um... Well, I was all excited and giddy because even though they were a week past the deadline in getting me their stuff...
3 of the recipes that they gave me were not even remotely related to any of the pictures I got.
On top of that, the pictures were in 240 DPI and I needed them in at least 300 DPI so I could use them.
So now I've had to have people do stuff to the pictures for me.
Thank goodness I can delegate the stuff.
so that I can use the pictures, and I still can't use as many of the recipes as I wanted to.
So they're just going to have to deal with only having three recipes in the damn magazine because they couldn't get their crap together, and if they do this crap next year, they don't get a section.
I'm a little irritated at them.
And they also didn't give us a title for their section, so I'm going to call it Forky Culinary.
I'm probably not, but that's what I feel like.
Well, tell us how you really feel.
Uh, Loki!
Um, I guess F you to my JTAG system for being very finicky.
Because it was red-rained, actually, earlier this week, and I got it fixed.
And so I was like, ooh, yeah, I can work back on my Grand Theft Auto stuff.
And now it's doing this stupid E79 error crap.
I think that may go away, though, because that's supposed to be a firmware glitch or corrupted firmware or something.
I'm updating the firmware anyways on it, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't have it.
I don't have it.
And I'm thinking like, okay, but it took a week.
Something's wrong in my work, I think.
Like, it wouldn't have taken a week for my coworkers to get it from me.
I think some disgruntled person, I'll say customer, came into the front door just long enough to spread the infection.
I think we're just all becoming zombies.
But like, every time my eye itches, I'm like, oh my god, his big eye.
I know, right?
Ugh.
All right, let's move on to a couple more news stories and then your phone calls where anything can happen.
Joy and Rapture.
Loki, what do you have for us?
More Rapture, though.
Super Mario Bros.
3 has actually been remade.
Funny enough, it's a mod to the new Super Mario Bros.
DS game.
They did new Super Mario Bros.
3, and it's kind of cool.
It's a completely redone game for all the Mario Bros.
3 levels, plus some additional challenge levels.
plus some actual hybrid levels with the Metroid stuff in there and all sorts of other crazy stuff.
You can download the actual mod for the ROM off of gbatemp.net and it's actually pretty awesome looking.
I'm thinking about checking it out with my... Wait, this is a ROM?
What system is this for?
It's a mod for a ROM for the DS.
I'm watching the video, it's really sweet.
Hmm.
It's pretty sweet.
Looks like they had to do a few creative liberties, but still overall very impressive.
Good for them.
How long till Nintendo sues?
At least they didn't say New Super Mario Bros.
3.
It's on LinkedIn.
So in that case, you want to get... Well, the fact that it's been on the internet longer than a day means that it'll never go away.
Everyone has it now.
Well, in a follow-up to something we were discussing just a minute ago, I think this is an appropriate last main story for tonight.
Gran Turismo 5 has a release date.
And I would like my Dr. Pepper, please.
November 24th is the day.
This is coming from Polyphony Digital's Kazunori Yamauchi.
Satisfying the loyal Gran Turismo followers is at the heart of all our efforts, which is why it was such a difficult decision to delay the release of the game, and one which we did not take lightly.
I can only apologize to everyone for making you wait so long, and I hope that when you try out the wealth of driving experiences available in Gran Turismo 5, you will not be disappointed.
Wow.
I want my Bugatti.
Can I race like my Honda Civic?
Probably.
Whatever the racing model would be.
They also have kart racing.
Nice.
And NASCAR.
But no Mario Kart.
I just want my Bugatti.
I'll be happy.
Well, they do have a track editor, Rob, so maybe you will get Mario Kart.
If there's a track editor, then it's just a matter of time before Mario Kart Circuit shows up, that's for sure.
Gran Turismo Kart!
Last Minute Stories, Loki?
Yes, and it was not even a week after the new dashboard came out and they've already ported it over to JTAG Systems for the Xbox 360.
So now, all those people with JTAGs, like myself, can play...
you know, Kinect games.
Of course, for people like me that bought a Kinect system with Kinect or a slim system with Kinect I had to order a really expensive adapter to play said thing on my old consoles.
You're so cryptic, I love it.
Let's go to El Telefonos and take some calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
It's the only listener with the fastest internet finger in the whole wide world, Ranma Clearly, you are the king of iron fingering What's on your mind?
Wait, I can barely hear you guys You are the king of iron fingering I try What's up?
Did he just cut out?
Ranma, are you there?
I'm right here Hi, what's on your mind?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Up, he's gone.
Oh, well.
Man, he wanted to talk about pornography.
Ranma, if you can hear us, we can't hear you.
I have to hang up on him.
I'm sorry, guys.
That was so dirty, we had to bleep that out from our show.
I can't believe you and your language.
Alright, well, apparently she was only ever actually in two movies.
But, you know, it's just like the whole new Super Mario Bros.
thing hitting the internet.
Once your vajay is on the internet, always on the internet.
Just ask Paris Hilton, right?
It was just that one little homemade porn they did.
Just one!
She's a talentless hack.
and I'm talking about the porno too.
You know what's crazy is that how much money does she have now and like who was she before that porn came out?
She was an heiress to the Hilton Hotel fortune or whatever.
And no one cared until we all saw her vajay.
And she was terrible at porn.
She was not good.
I give her a thumbs down.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So I don't know, I'm thinking, I don't know what good will come out of whoever else owns Harmonix at this point.
I mean, unless of course they go back to Activision, which is like a really, really fucked up situation.
I don't think it'll ever happen just because of battered wife syndrome they experience.
The whole Guitar Hero thing.
So I'm willing, you know, I was wondering, I guess we should propose taking bets to see who will be their next suitor.
E.A.
I've been surprised before, maybe I'll be surprised again.
Who knows?
It could be something completely fucking random, like Sega.
Yeah, you're right.
It could be them, but I'm thinking the shoe-ins are definitely, you're right, EA and then Konami.
Konami making more logical sense just because it'll pretty much rein in all the musical game talent into one house.
Yeah.
It would be interesting, but again, I think that's more of a fanboy's dream because this might be a harsh thing to say, but I'm not sure what musical talent house is left at Konami.
Poor Naoki Madea is fighting for his life over there.
And, you know, he's a great guy, really sweet, nice guy.
But Dance Masters was extremely rushed and mostly recycled.
Although I think Dance Masters 2 could be very interesting.
I don't know if they'll get the chance unless the game does really well in Japan, which it might.
well I mean on one hand you still have those old timers the ones who basically started the whole music game genre in Konami you still have most of them still you know whatever's left of them trying to see whether or not they can take you know if they make the argument that maybe they should bring harmonics on board then it'll be in safer hands because you know you have a company that has a crap ton more experience with that whole genre than EA would ever ever do in a you know in their history
I know, it is wishful
But then again, as long as EA doesn't rock the boat.
The idea is whoever buys them has to give them the autonomy, give them the light of day to operate it as an independent company in that sense.
Maybe it won't be such a terrible thing if EA buys them.
It may not be such a terrible thing if EA buys them.
EA has access to all the music.
On one hand, I wouldn't want EA to buy them just because I know it would be a lot better than Activision.
or any other company that would just drain them and make them whore them out every year for a single new release.
I think we can all agree, not Activision.
No, yeah, of course, obviously.
They're going to milk that proverbial cap, and that's pretty much what's killing that genre.
You have companies that are doing twice or three times as worse as Konami has ever done in terms of milking out the franchise.
I know, if one could argue, you could say the same thing with DDR, but there were certain periods in that, you know...
in that game's history where there was time in between any major release, especially in the arcade versions.
Actdeft in our chatroom says, I still say Squareinodasonics.
I can't even pronounce all that.
Dream on.
No, I don't know.
I guess anything's possible, really.
So we'll see.
We'll probably hear more probably after, I would say after the new year, but I don't know.
Sometimes these things tend to move quickly.
And that goes to show boys and girls that you don't let any big corporate non-video game company buy a video game company for the sake of doing it.
Because chances are, I don't care if they have the best connections to your genre, they're going to pimp you on and bleed you dry.
Well, but here's the thing.
I'm not so sure I totally agree with that.
I'm all for the idea of fight the man and all that stuff and stay independent and all that.
But I wonder if Rock Band would have been quite the cultural phenomenon if it hadn't been attached to MTV and Viacom.
I'll tell you this much.
That Beatles game would have never happened without the Viacom.
You're right, yeah.
I mean, they have the connections.
But on the other hand, they don't understand the video game industry that well.
They just see it as something they could easily ride in the short term.
And now they think they've ridden it to full term because unfortunately the Beatles game did not perform to expectations.
Exactly, that's the whole point.
There's a whole variety of reasons why that happened.
Same thing with corporate America.
It's mostly short-sighted.
Especially those guys at Viacom.
Alright, buddy, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls.
Thank you very much.
Have a good one, though.
Take care.
Have a good one.
Bye-bye.
Some folks are saying, AkumaJP says in our chatroom, I'm not saying Konami is buying anything, but Konami is not that small.
They're in a lot of businesses, not just games.
Here's my reasoning for saying that, is that I think a lot of that is very Japanese-based, and Harmonix is also an American developer, and Konami has really scaled back their operations here in America.
I mean, some of the best music stuff they were producing was out of Hawaii, Gone, and then Emeryville.
DarkSakura,
Well, regardless, they were in the Bay and now they're not anymore.
Was it in Redwood City or something?
Yeah, it was Redwood City.
No, that's in Washington.
No.
No, that's Redmond.
It's somewhere.
Anyhow, the point is they've scaled back their American operations quite a bit.
So unless they've got the money to throw down to try and expand it again, I don't know if I see that happening.
Anyhow, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
All one word if you want to give us a call.
We're taking calls right now.
Any other last minute stories you want to get to, Loki, while we wait for some calls?
If any are going to come in?
Let's see.
Mushi Hime Sama Bug Panic is coming out.
Hime.
Hime.
Mushi Hime Sama Bug Panic is coming out on iPhone.
Mushroom Princess.
November 18th.
I'm looking forward to that.
It's actually a cave adventure game.
That's the Castlevania person doing music, right?
Yes, it is.
I remember that from a previous show.
The actual Mushihime-sama is a shooter, but this is an adventure game.
I have covered this.
Call us, people!
It's still a shooter.
It's just she's running around instead.
Wow, it worked.
Like, right as she said that, DarkSakura, our phones started lighting off the hook.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Excellent.
Hey, it's like all our regular callers tonight.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Hey, nothing much.
I'll make it short and sweet.
What kind of games are you looking forward to this holiday season?
Hmm.
Well, definitely the WoW nerd in me is excited for Cataclysm.
I think that's a duh.
I think otherwise most of them have come out now.
I think Kinect was one of the things I was looking forward to with Dance Central and all that.
Very interesting.
Civ V was certainly one that I was looking forward to as well, and now that's already happened.
Otherwise, you know, we're not looking at a lot of big games that I'm interested in because of the fact that we have the console evolutions, if you will, between the Move and the Kinect.
Kinect.
As far as the Wii goes, though, sadly not a lot.
The other thing I'm really looking forward to is the 3DS, and sadly they didn't make it for this holiday, but next year.
Will you be playing it?
Because I know you're not really big in handheld games.
You know what?
I'm not, but the 3DS was something else.
The 3DS brings me something that I can't get on my TV.
Do you think just by getting it, you're going to be doing it because, I'm not sure you said because of the hype, but it's going to be one of those things where you're like, oh, I want to play it, and then after you play it, you're like, okay, I played it, and kind of like the Wii and the rest of the system, then just put it aside and just collect dust?
probably but there's also that part of me that's kind of like as a gaming enthusiast this is definitely something really new for games well I get yeah I mean you could say well what about Rad Racer and the Virtual Boy but I don't know something about 3DS I think is going to really resonate with people the way these things of the past haven't I think just part of as a gaming fanatic I kind of owe it to myself to pick one up
Are you going to pick it up on day one?
Most likely because if that Kid Icarus game is coming out day one, which I don't see why it wouldn't be, again, I really have to have that.
Somebody who's loved that game since it was out back in the day.
Are you afraid possibly the Kid Icarus games are going to turn into the Metroid M?
I haven't played Metroid M. I'm not so sold on the fact that it's as terrible as everyone's making it out to be, but I'm also a Metroid fanboy.
Yeah, of course, there's always the possibility the game's going to be terrible, so I guess I'll waste some of the early reviews and early impressions, but...
I don't think that'll stop me from eventually wanting to pick it up.
I mean, most Nintendo first party games are still pretty solid.
It's very rare that Nintendo puts out a first party stinker.
Let's not forget Other M isn't a first party game.
I mean, it is and it isn't.
You know what I mean?
So, most games that Nintendo does in-house themselves are pretty darn good.
I mean, they have made some stinkers and some things that were better on paper than they were in-game, like Nintendogs.
But Nintendogs also really called out to a certain audience that just wasn't me.
You know?
Little kids love Nintendogs.
and get mauled by them too because of playing them.
Yes, I remember that story from a few weeks ago.
What about you, X-Link?
Turning around and putting it right back on you.
What are you looking forward to this holiday season?
Too many games, too little time.
I have too many on my Steam account to still go through, and then I'm worried about what's going to happen come this Christmas if Steam does something compared to last year.
Oh, they will.
Absolutely they will.
And, you know, it's funny because I have Metroid Other M. I haven't got the time since I moved to set up my Wii.
I just recently set up my Wii, so I'm going to probably sit down this week and play it for a little while to see how good it is or see how much of a flop.
But it should be interesting.
But, um...
Anyone in studio want to chime in on this?
The game they're really looking forward to this holiday?
I'm not really looking forward to a game, actually.
I want to save my money and go to Disneyland.
There you go.
A lot of other stuff that I wasn't... I want to play in Flynn's Arcade.
Oh, the Tron game.
I'm looking forward to the Tron game.
Yes, yes, yes, the Tron game.
The Tron game does look good.
It's Prince of Persia with Tron.
Are you very afraid of them dropping the ball on that also?
Because that's my biggest concern is that it looks good and you can see pictures and you see the demos and stuff, but then when it comes out, it'll be like... Of course.
What did they do to this?
X-Link Movie tie-in games are almost always terrible.
There are very few movie tie-in games that ever do very well.
GoldenEye is like the biggest exception to a rule in the history of ever.
Like, you know what I mean?
No, that's why Pierce Brosnan was in it.
It was out there to support the movie.
And the game was better than the movie.
I mean, that never happens.
You know what I mean?
So, I think Tron...
I don't think Tron is going to be like the oh my god face melting is awesome game ever but I think it will be cool you know just even based on what little bit I played at E3 I think if they can kind of bring something into the story and sort of bridge the gap between the two movies which is what the game is supposed to do that'll be kind of neat
Yeah, hopefully they'll keep it much to the movie as possible.
That's what I like to hopefully see in that and play because I loved Tron growing up when I grew up as a kid.
I saw that and I was totally amazed by the way they did that and I'm looking forward for the one that comes out.
Giovede in our chatroom brings up another Wii game that we're kind of neglecting here for the holidays.
Epic Mickey.
Giovede says, I want Epic Mickey.
I think that is going to be probably one of the biggest sellers on the Wii this holiday season because I think it does a good job of something for hardcore and casual players.
Yeah.
At least for the hardcore who haven't abandoned their Wiis altogether.
And I think at the same time, it's a game that kids can play and they'll be kind of excited about it.
It's sort of like...
And I'm looking forward to the new Donkey Kong.
I really want to see how that lives up to the other ones, so that would be fun.
All right.
Well, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can go wrap up the show.
Thank you so much for your call.
I appreciate it.
No problem.
I'm going to go fishing.
See you.
I hope you're able to play a million games this holiday season.
You better still make great nights.
Between WoW and everything, I don't know how it's going to go.
All right.
Have a good one, buddy.
Yep.
You too.
Alright, that's going to do it for calls tonight.
Thank you guys so much for trying to call.
For those that didn't get through because we got slammed at the end there.
I don't know.
It's so weird how it comes in phases like that.
Please send us an email.
Share your thoughts over email.
We'd appreciate it.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or what I like to call Make Jamie Work.
Anyhow, that's... What?
Love you.
I work plenty.
I know you do.
Alright.
You're working very hard on your Knights of the Magic Crystals.
I'm not playing it right now.
right now.
Yeah, because it's all on cooldown.
Yeah, it's all on cooldown.
She spent all her points for the hour.
If the chat room was working for me, I would be in there.
I am messing.
Slow your roll.
It's going to be okay.
What?
903 is when the band was lifted, I looked.
What?
Oh, 903?
Yeah, which is going to be interesting because we're about ready to end the show.
No FUs tonight.
Yeah, we can't do FUs or a cage match.
We can't take votes in a cage match.
Well, 903 is only a few minutes away.
Yeah, well, can we stretch for 12 more minutes?
Do you have more last-minute stories?
It's not really 12 minutes.
I guess it's 12 minutes.
We can indeed still do Cage Match, Rob, because you tally the votes.
And I can add some extra windows to that.
Okay, I was like, I don't know how to do private messages on here.
Okay, if you know how to do it, then we can figure it out.
But I still should ask if there's any other last-minute stories, because I didn't really let Loki finish.
No.
No.
Well, I could talk about some other stuff, I guess.
Sure.
I suppose.
The PlayStation 3, there was supposed to be a new jailbreak device that got put out, but it was supposed to be a downgrader.
Of course, right now, it's kind of in limbo of whether or not that's actually legit or not.
Most people think it's not.
But of course, people found ways around different protections, including getting Black Ops to work.
So, it's kind of funny.
and then what else was going to talk about oh yeah Darksiders 2 got announced it's supposed to take place alongside the original Darksiders series I guess they're going to have up to four games because it's going to be one for each horseman of the apocalypse because they're saying that there's only one apocalypse and it wouldn't make sense to have a sequel to the game Final Fantasy always has an apocalypse
Yeah, but that's Final Fantasy, and you know, that's just very unrealistic.
Whereas Darksiders, you know, absolutely full of realism.
Aren't video games all supposed to be a little bit unrealistic?
Unless it's like, I don't know, like a sports game?
I'm being sarcastic, bro.
Oh, oh, oh, my bad.
Yes, you just didn't seem to get it, did you?
Story of my life.
Yeah.
Don't agree with that!
I think that was more of a dismissive yeah.
Other fun stuff that we can mention here.
We'll just go through all the stories.
Grand Theft Auto Trilogy coming out on Macs.
Wow, that took a long enough time.
I had Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on my old PC laptop that I got back in 2005.
Yeah, that took some time there.
Glad to see that they're...
On the ball with that stuff.
And then, apparently, was it Crazy Taxis coming out later this month?
That's kind of neat.
Let's make some crazy money!
On Xbox Live Arcade.
Of course, it's not going to have all the wonderful, you know, product placement in it.
Just have fun.
And all the music.
All the licensed music is not there anymore.
Oh, darn.
I love it.
AkumaJP in chat is like, What?
Final Fantasy is real!
Only at anime conventions.
Is it real?
And this is kind of neat.
The tabletop game Zombies apparently is coming to Xbox Live Arcade as well.
And I haven't actually played that tabletop game, but it looks like it might be fun.
America loves zombies.
It's also, I guess, it might be coming to Windows 7 as well.
Windows Phone 7.
I love plants versus zombies.
Apparently that will be the first quarter of 2011.
And I guess it was announced three years ago.
All right.
We still need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, so I don't want you to keep feeling like you have to buy time.
Is that all you want to mention, or are there any other stories that are killing you over there?
Nope, that's it.
You know, we could always just watch the boobie video again.
No, I'm kidding.
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up for the night.
We might actually end at midnight Eastern tonight.
What a change of pace.
The East Coast listeners will be getting embedded at a decent hour.
Thanks, you guys.
Anyhow, let's go around to everybody's final thoughts and try to wrap up the show tonight and say thanks for listening and all that.
Salacious Pop, thank you so much for being here, as always.
And do you have any final thoughts tonight for our listeners?
No.
He's a man of many words tonight.
All right, Loki, do you have any final thoughts tonight?
Not really.
I'm just going to try to play more stuff this week and get some more sleep, and I don't know.
That's all I can do.
My final thought is I'm really going to try to avoid getting pink eye again because it sucks.
DarkSakura, your final thought?
I'm still getting used to the stuff on my face.
Your hair?
My hair.
I have bangs now.
I like your hair.
It's cute.
All right.
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and supporting us.
We really appreciate it.
Hey, if you like what you heard tonight, please tell people about our show.
Tell two people about our show.
Help us spread the word.
Kind reviews on iTunes are always helpful as well.
Just anything you can do because we don't have advertising.
We're not running advertising on the show, you notice, too.
It's really the only way we can help spread word of mouth
And stop asking about me fixing the PSP site.
Literally, I get like 10 minutes a week to myself to work on stuff.
I'd do it if I knew how, but I don't.
I will need to talk to you about getting the FTP code.
It's been so long since I've actually gone and done anything.
That I can do.
We can work that out.
Alright, that's going to do it anyway, so Loki's aware, folks.
He'll try what he can.
But yeah, that's it.
We're done.
Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
We'll see you next week.
We'll do this all over again.
Episode 390.
We'll see you next week, guys!
But we're probably right anyway.
See you next week!
