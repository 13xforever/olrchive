0	20000	Tonight, November 28th, 2010, BBC programming comes to video game consoles courtesy of PlayStation
20000	25120	Network, could indie games soon feature the Kinect, and another musician sues the makers
25120	31920	of Guitar Hero.
31920	36240	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36240	39500	Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
39500	44380	It is episode number 391 for November 28th of 2010.
44380	45380	My name is Rob Roberts.
45380	49560	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts, the one and only
49560	52120	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
52120	53560	I had balls.
53560	57280	Well, we want to go there this early in the show.
57280	59680	They were meaty and tangy.
59680	60680	You're talking about meatballs.
60680	61680	Yeah, barbecue meatballs.
61680	64000	Where did you get some barbecue meatballs?
64000	65000	From my husband.
65000	66000	I ate his balls.
66000	67080	You got to eat his balls.
67080	69040	You wouldn't even let me lick his balls.
69040	70040	You can lick them.
70040	71040	There's some left.
71040	72040	Okay, good.
72040	73040	I'll lick them later.
73040	74040	He's got a lot of balls.
74040	75040	All right.
75040	79360	Anyway, let's also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
79360	80360	Hello.
80360	83800	I need to ask if you have any interest in licking Dan's balls.
83800	87960	No, I'm quite full on eating... was it garlic parmesan twists?
87960	89920	You're downing the sticks over there, I see.
89920	90920	No interest in the balls.
90920	91920	That's fine.
91920	92920	They're twists, okay?
92920	93920	They're not sticks.
93920	96040	How is your parmesan twists?
96040	97040	They're okay.
97040	103200	They were late, though, because I got... they said 15 to 20 minutes, got there 30 minutes
103200	104200	later.
104200	105200	It should have been done by now.
105200	109240	I get there and they're like, oh, yeah, we forgot to put them in the oven.
109240	110840	Well, that doesn't help me out any.
110840	113640	It's like, fucking put it in the oven.
113640	114640	We're sorry.
114640	118560	Did you get it like a discount or a coupon or...
118560	119560	Fuck no.
119560	120560	Here's what ended up happening.
120560	124520	I could tell you exactly what happened because I've been there because some stupid employee
124520	126800	did it before.
126800	129920	What happened was my twists were probably done, but there was another order that also
129920	132960	had an order of twists, and so they just took it for that order.
132960	134240	Oh, not cool.
134240	135240	Yeah.
135240	136240	Not cool.
136240	137240	All right.
137240	141440	Next up with us is the chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
141440	144760	Going to Breakman in our chat room starts us off tonight.
144760	146320	Every gamer has a voice.
146320	147760	Just please don't embarrass the rest of us.
147760	150080	I think that sums it up very well, actually.
150080	151080	Thank you, Breakman.
151080	153080	We do have another guest here in studio.
153080	155600	We are very excited to have her on the show.
155600	158360	She's a good friend of Dark Sakura.
158360	161240	She's known for a very long time, and I love her to bits, too.
161240	164840	And Loki, I don't think they ever really hang out, but they'd probably be besties if they
164840	165840	did.
165840	167440	Let's move on to Marissa.
167440	168440	How are you?
168440	169440	Hi, kiddies.
169440	170440	How are you?
170440	171440	I'm good.
171440	172440	How are you?
172440	173440	Good.
173440	174440	And do you have a nickname that you use that we should call you?
174440	177760	Well, I always go and buy Marissa con gusto, but my boyfriend prefers to call me Marissa
177760	178760	con busto.
178760	179760	That's right.
179760	185840	Here's the thing, and it's a bummer we don't have the webcam anymore, but Marissa has big
185840	186840	boobs.
186840	188200	Oh, my God.
188200	189880	They're so big.
189880	190880	They're awesome.
190880	193160	But we love them.
193160	196040	And she also has a big brain, everybody, to go with it.
196040	197040	Thank you.
197040	198680	So don't just stare.
198680	201280	The extra boobs are to hold extra brains.
201280	202600	That's right.
202600	203600	Exactly.
203600	206920	And do you even play video games, or are you just kind of here for the lulz?
206920	207920	Both.
207920	211560	You know, actually, I listen every week, and I've always dated people that are really into
211560	214880	games, but I'm kind of an old school gamer, and I'm just going to wait for eternity for
214880	218040	another King's Quest to come out, and Thief is never going to come out.
218040	220040	I don't care what they say.
220040	224760	Okay, you can stay, because Retro Game, especially if you're going to go straight to King's Quest,
224760	229360	which is some of the holy grail of PC games, and you know, we've actually had a lot of
229360	234660	talk about the, and you may not even know this is out here, the fan-made King's Quest,
234660	235660	the silver lining.
235660	236660	I've heard about that.
236660	241000	Yeah, it's totally free, and I think they're on the second episode now, and Roberta Williams,
241000	244760	even though I think she lives out in the woods in a fort now and has totally disavowed all
244760	246760	the gaming industry.
246760	248600	The fort?
248600	251040	That might be her fort, actually, out there in the wilderness.
251040	255120	All I know is that she wants nothing to do with the gaming industry in this day and age,
255120	260880	but she actually kind of gave it a blessing without giving it her blessing, like legally.
260880	265680	It's basically like, hey, I'm not going to make any more of that series until I need
265680	266680	more money.
266680	272920	Kind of like how JK Rowling's, I'm not going to make any more books, but maybe I could
272920	277880	revisit the world at some point, when I start running out of money, of course.
277880	282080	I love adventure games, and that's always been my thing, but there's all this hype about
282080	288080	Siberia coming out, and that's like, to sit like no one ever boldly sat before a game.
288080	291280	I bet you would like some of the stuff that Telltale does, because they're trying to make
291280	295880	that live on with the whole Sam and Max games, they've got the Back to the Future games coming
295880	296880	out soon.
296880	298680	I bet you that type of stuff would be right up their alley.
298680	303200	We need to get you and Seg here on the same night, because he works there, and he could
303200	304840	sell you much better than I could.
304840	305840	Love Sam and Max.
305840	306840	All right.
306840	307840	Anyhow, I just have to go to the chat room.
307840	312560	I just want to give you a taste at the chatters.
312560	313560	All right.
313560	314560	I'm not even going to read the names here.
314560	315560	Here we go.
315560	316560	You ready?
316560	317560	Let's see.
317560	322520	Oh, actually, I will say Jessica Harper said, bigger than mine, possibly.
322520	323520	I think so.
323520	326840	I think you might both have to whip them out, and we'll see.
326840	330920	Whoever wins this contest doesn't actually win, if you know what I mean.
330920	332560	But here's some of the other comments.
332560	339320	Awesomely big, big boobs, the mighty rack, take a photo and post it in the OLR gallery,
339320	340440	OMG boobs.
340440	342080	Her boobs have brains in them.
342080	343440	Everybody likes boobs.
343440	344440	Boobs.
344440	345440	Balls.
345440	348240	That's what the show's turned into tonight.
348240	350600	Picks of tits or get the fuck out.
350600	351600	That was from a girl.
351600	353600	Just so you know.
353600	356640	My boyfriend tells me tits are get-foes, so it's okay.
356640	357640	Is it weird?
357640	358640	No, wait.
358640	359640	No, I lied.
359640	360640	That was from a boy.
360640	363080	So, but still, they want picks.
363080	366200	Is it weird that I'm the one that's keeping the show grounded at this point?
366200	369560	I mean, is that strange to you?
369560	374720	I mean, clearly there was some type of crack cocaine in our turkey for the Thanksgiving
374720	375720	holiday.
375720	377720	I hope you all had a pleasant Thanksgiving.
377720	381080	I hope you didn't, you know, get in a car wreck or anything.
381080	383000	But if you're listening to the show, you must be fine.
383000	385480	So congratulations, and I hope you had a wonderful one.
385480	386480	It's not a girl.
386480	387480	Don't kiss me.
387480	388480	No, I know.
388480	391200	It seems we're all running together, and I read it as somebody else.
391200	392200	Sorry.
392200	393200	It's live radio.
393200	397360	I don't always do well at it, even though it's only been, what, nine years.
397360	401480	So anyway, Marissa's gonna join us tonight and Lowell with us, and Shirley, if you have
401480	403480	any input, you just jump right in there.
403480	407080	And you will have no problem jumping right in there.
407080	410720	We might play a game later, too, in part B, so that'll be fun.
410720	413000	We'll get the chatters involved, and it'll be a good time.
413000	415000	It's called Guess Marissa's Cup Size.
415000	416000	Oh, stop.
416000	417000	Stop.
417000	418000	That would be a hard one.
418000	419000	Do you...
419000	420000	We don't want to...
420000	421000	Ha ha, pun.
421000	422000	Sorry.
422000	423000	You've done it with me.
423000	424000	Sorry.
424000	428640	I don't want to give Marissa a complex or make people think it's only about her boobs,
428640	431360	because actually, you are a musician, correct?
431360	432360	Yes.
432360	433360	You do.
433360	434360	And what type of music do you do?
434360	439400	Well, I do a neo-folk-pop thing, but as most...
439400	440400	Neo-folk-pop.
440400	441400	Yeah.
441400	445640	It's like, acoustic is probably the better word, because you say folky, and people think
445640	447360	like Peter, Paul, and Mary, you know.
447360	449640	So like, Jewel, do you yodel?
449640	452240	Um, well, uh, no.
452240	453240	Okay.
453240	454880	Because if you said yes, I was going to make you do it.
454880	462140	I think, you know, most musicians nowadays specialize in being broke, so that's my feel.
462140	464920	You are actually the definition of starving LA artist, correct?
464920	466720	What's that old joke?
466720	468960	What do you call a musician without a girlfriend?
468960	469960	Homeless.
469960	474600	Because I have the opposite situation.
474600	475920	All right.
475920	477960	Well, you know what?
477960	481320	I've heard some of your stuff, and I know you've got talent, and it's just, that moment
481320	482320	will come.
482320	483320	Someday.
483320	484320	That moment will come.
484320	485320	All right.
485320	486440	But I love the whole folk-pop thing.
486440	487440	That's amazing.
487440	488440	All right.
488440	492400	Anyhow, let's get into talking about our gaming weeks.
492400	495280	We always start off the show talking about what's going on in our gaming world this week,
495280	496280	so we'll go to Dark Sakura.
496280	499920	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
499920	509120	Well, we played some Rock Band of the Beatles and Three Variety, and Marissa belted out
509120	522320	a good one, and some Star Trek Online, a lot of games on my phone, that's about it.
522320	523320	All right.
523320	526440	You look amused, like you're about to laugh about something.
526440	529860	It's just chat and boobs, and the show amuses me.
529860	531000	It's okay to laugh.
531000	532720	I am wearing my Silent Hill shirt, though.
532720	533720	I'm very happy.
533720	534720	Yes, you are.
534720	535720	Because it's cold.
535720	536720	I could wear my Silent Hill shirt.
536720	539440	At least it's not foggy, then that might be the right kind of atmosphere.
539440	540440	It was the other day.
540440	541440	Was it?
541440	542440	Yes, it was.
542440	543440	It was quite foggy last night.
543440	544440	All right.
544440	545440	Well, let's go to Loki.
545440	546440	How was your gaming week?
546440	547440	Anything new or exciting?
547440	548440	No.
548440	549440	Unfortunately not.
549440	550440	It really is.
550440	555680	Just Grand Theft Auto this week, and Stick Wars on my iPod.
555680	558640	That was about it, I mean, really.
558640	560120	What is Stick Wars?
560120	563760	Stick Wars, remember that game, Defender Castle, where you take little stick figures and throw
563760	564760	them into the air?
564760	565760	You told me a little bit about this last week.
565760	570800	Yeah, it's basically like a knockoff of that, and then, so I've been playing it forever
570800	575000	now, and yeah, it's really it.
575000	582320	I mean, I don't know, I haven't been able to do much else because I had to make dinner
582320	589040	for Thanksgiving, and then I had to put up Christmas lights, and put up a tree, and...
589040	592660	Well, it sounds like you didn't have much of a holiday.
592660	595480	You had more of a working past few days.
595480	600560	And fixed my sister's computer because she got like 65 different things of spyware on
600560	601560	there.
601560	603660	That takes talent.
603660	608120	How many porn sites does one have to visit to get all of that spyware installed?
608120	609120	I just reinstalled Windows.
609120	611160	It's my old laptop that I used to bring in.
611160	616360	Thankfully, because I was like, well, I hate the fact that this has a super recovery partition.
616360	621280	I love the fact that that has a super recovery partition because all I did was, eh, fuck
621280	626460	it, I don't care, back up, and it'll just erase everything out of there, reinstall Windows
626460	631400	with all the stuff that was on there from when I got it, and any files that were important
631400	634680	get backed up into a folder, delete everything else, and we're good.
634680	637640	So I can reinstall Windows like super quick.
637640	639640	It's awesome.
639640	643920	But, yeah, that's pretty much all I was doing.
643920	647160	I was hoping to play some Connect stuff, never got around to that.
647160	651040	In fact, I can't now because I moved the coffee table to put the tree in.
651040	654240	So I don't have room anymore to play Connect in my living room.
654240	659460	You notice I notice a lot of people complaining about the amount of space that Connect requires,
659460	662160	that for a lot of people it actually isn't practical.
662160	665520	I've noticed that kind of buzz around the internet lately, like a lot of people complaining
665520	666520	about the space you need.
666520	669560	Well, it's just that coffee table, I don't like it anymore.
669560	675440	You know, it's a coffee table I got from my grandparents, I mean it's old, and it's really
675440	676440	cumbersome.
676440	682400	I'm thinking of getting two ottomans instead and just sitting them next to each other for
682400	687160	a coffee table, and that way we can use them as seating as well if we need to, and we can
687160	690240	move them out of the way a lot easier.
690240	693480	It's just that set of furniture is just really old.
693480	698320	But anyways, yeah, so not that I was really going to be able to play Connect stuff anyways,
698320	701760	I know I get a lot of time to play games at home, but at work though I can.
701760	706240	In fact, it's funny, some of my co-workers, they're in charge of, oh, here's something
706240	709800	else I forgot to mention last week, it was hilarious.
709800	711160	Holy slit my mind.
711160	713920	I actually rode a mechanical bull last week.
713920	714920	What?
714920	721360	Yes, our work, they do these parties once a month or whatever at the end of each month.
721360	725760	So last week was technically the end of the month because we weren't there this week.
725760	727000	And you rode a mechanical bull?
727000	728000	Yeah.
728000	729880	So it was more like a drunken sorority party then?
729880	730880	No.
730880	731880	Okay.
731880	734280	It was funny because I wanted to see, you know, I wanted to do it better than everybody
734280	735280	else.
735280	736280	Sure, of course.
736280	737280	And how long did you last?
737280	738280	I did really well actually.
738280	744480	In fact, I was taunting the guy that was operating it, and so he did a really difficult ride,
744480	747240	and I kicked the crap out of it, so it was fun.
747240	750600	So you just have to hold on and...
750600	751600	Pretty much.
751600	753960	It was pretty easy.
753960	758960	No, but other than that, just a lot more, you know, Dance Central.
758960	762920	Actually, I did play a little bit of Dance Central during work, just some of the few
762920	763920	songs on there.
763920	767720	I'm thinking of getting some of the download content, but I'm gonna have to wait until
767720	769760	I upgrade certain systems.
769760	773960	You do know there are very, very few people out there listening to the show or anywhere
773960	776720	that can say, I played Dance Central at work?
776720	779480	Well, on my break, you know.
779480	782040	No, I know, but still, this is funny.
782040	786640	And then of course, still working on editing Grand Theft Auto stuff, and then yesterday
786640	788640	I was messing with...
788640	789640	It's not even really a game.
789640	796100	Well, I consider it a game because I'm getting free money for exploiting a website.
796100	797280	So that was kind of a game.
797280	799640	This is a website, appredeem.com.
799640	807440	You download free apps, paid apps, or if you have a jailbroken phone, free apps, and they
807440	809440	give you money.
809440	810720	Interesting.
810720	812520	Like straight into your PayPal account.
812520	815640	This sounds like one of those free iPod schemes.
815640	817760	It's not a scheme though, but here's the thing.
817760	822600	I guess they're trying to entice you to buy the apps, but if you really don't want to,
822600	827360	you just put in your PayPal account, the email that you use for your PayPal account, and
827360	831520	you can just go download the free apps and you get like $1.50 for free.
831520	832520	Weird.
832520	837720	So, you don't even have to buy any of the paid apps, just download the free ones.
837720	838720	It's a free dollar.
838720	842200	I mean, who would not want free money?
842200	843360	The apps do suck though.
843360	845280	They're terrible apps.
845280	849160	I was going to say, do they pay you to give that little plug here on our show?
849160	852360	No, I just thought it was cool because it's free money.
852360	856860	See, if I was trying to exploit everything, I would give out a link or something that
856860	860560	would have like some sort of referral thing or something where I'd get credit for it,
860560	861560	but I don't care.
861560	867200	So, I'm just saying though that, I mean, all you do is download these apps, you go into
867200	871600	them for like a second, go back to the website, you get credit for it, delete the app, you're
871600	872600	done.
872600	873600	Wow.
873600	874600	All right.
874600	875600	Anyways.
875600	876600	Well, anything, yeah.
876600	879840	I like this comment in our chat room, Act Def says, a week later, my PayPal account
879840	880840	got hacked.
880840	886560	I don't think they can hack your PayPal account by just giving them an email address, and
886560	887560	it doesn't have to...
887560	888560	Or use a different one.
888560	889560	Yeah, exactly.
889560	890560	It doesn't have to be.
890560	893200	I didn't realize it was, they were going to use that email address as a PayPal account,
893200	897320	so I'd actually create a second PayPal account for the email address that I gave them, so
897320	898320	whatever.
898320	899320	All right.
899320	901200	I'll just send it to my original PayPal account.
901200	902200	All right.
902200	903200	Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
903200	904200	That's it.
904200	905200	All right.
905200	908480	Marissa, I don't know if you've been playing any games recently, but I thought I'd ask
908480	909480	if there's anything.
909480	911600	I know you have one of those, don't you have like one of those fancy Windows phones now
911600	912600	or something?
912600	913600	I don't know.
913600	914640	Maybe you've been playing games on that.
914640	916920	You don't put the word fancy and Windows phone together.
916920	919400	Well, they have this new thing there.
919400	922680	Maybe it's like the new Windows phone they're really pushing, but it's this whole like Xbox
922680	926320	Live integration, and it's trying to compete with the iPhone.
926320	927320	Excuse me.
927320	928320	Yeah.
928320	929320	I, yeah.
929320	934760	I have a Touch Pro 2, and nobody cares anything for it, and it's Sprint, but I only pay, you
934760	939920	know, 35 bucks a month, so I'll deal with it, but I've, I don't know, I've heard just
939920	943520	within the community, because I was looking, you know, like I'm ineligible for any upgrades
943520	948560	even though the hardware is capable of it, which stinks, but HTC makes a good phone,
948560	950960	so at least I know that everything else is solid.
950960	954400	And I lost my rock band, Virginity, to Jamie.
954400	955400	Nice.
955400	956400	So.
956400	958080	So did you, you actually did some of the singing in the game?
958080	962960	The singing, I played a guitar and bass, and I guess I have to go back and now tell my
962960	966220	musician friends who are always bitching about it that they appreciate it.
966220	969280	This is where I wanted to go with this, because a lot of musicians, I'm glad you brought this
969280	974420	up, because a lot of musicians like to razz on rock band because it's not really playing
974420	980000	an instrument, and it's like dumbing down music, and did you feel that way, or were
980000	982920	you like, no, this is just, this is just fun and nothing else?
982920	988000	In a really abstract way, I could see how like for, like a little kid, you know, like
988000	991280	maybe you should just actually give them an instrument before just, I mean, if they, if
991280	994180	they have a musical instrument, you should probably give them a real instrument and let
994180	999160	them explore that, as opposed to just trying to virtually experience that, but like you're,
999160	1003120	you know, otherwise, I mean, the game is great, and it's a lot of fun, and as opposed to what
1003120	1007720	a lot of people think, you have to appreciate the music in order to really enjoy the game.
1007720	1012320	I mean, because the game by itself is entertaining, but again, we really have to enjoy the music
1012320	1014320	to get all your money's worth.
1014320	1015320	It's fun.
1015320	1016320	Yeah.
1016320	1019840	So, and I don't know if you got to see any of this, but, well, probably not, because
1019840	1023280	I don't think the actual guitars are out, or I don't think Jamie has them, but there's
1023280	1027320	actually these pro modes now in rock band where you can like learn to play the real
1027320	1029800	instrument, and I've been doing it for keyboard, which is kind of fun, because I used to play
1029800	1033720	keyboard back when I was like 12, so it's kind of fun to get back into that.
1033720	1038280	And you know, if you wait long enough, even though it is kind of an inferior game, according
1038280	1043800	to reviews, I'm sure Power Giggle will drop in price really quickly, and that has, you
1043800	1045400	know, a electric guitar with it too.
1045400	1046400	That's what I saw, actually, though.
1046400	1049640	The thing, though, that ticked me off about that, though, I mean, I, you know, I don't
1049640	1053080	know if there's the gaming part of it, but you can get a really nice starter guitar for
1053080	1055480	the price of that piece of crap, I'm sorry.
1055480	1056480	It's alright.
1056480	1057480	Like, if you want...
1057480	1058480	We're honest here at OLR.
1058480	1061520	Just like for the, you know, if you want to play the game, that's fine, if you want to
1061520	1065680	play and even use that to learn, that's fine too, but it's way overpriced, considering
1065680	1067920	that you can go get a nice squire, you know.
1067920	1071880	I think for some people, though, it's really that interactivity, that it, being able to
1071880	1075880	kind of interact and get that, you know, we're a very instant gratification society, right?
1075880	1079080	So to pick up a guitar and just kind of strum sometimes isn't, because you're not sure if
1079080	1080080	you're doing it right.
1080080	1082360	Unless you're playing Green Day songs, then who cares.
1082360	1083480	What I think that we should do...
1083480	1085680	Because you know there's a whole rock band that's just Green Day.
1085680	1087560	I don't know how you can do that, it's only three chords.
1087560	1091000	Well, because there's five buttons, so it works.
1091000	1097120	No, no, what they need to do is just have like another like contest or something, like
1097120	1098840	a power gig contest.
1098840	1103280	Once those things get cheap enough, you just smash the guitar at the end of each song.
1103280	1104280	It's fun.
1104280	1109680	It's like, yeah, this game sucks, but that felt good.
1109680	1113800	It's funny though, it's easier to smash expensive guitars than cheap ones, because the cheaper
1113800	1115760	ones are made out of plywood and plastic.
1115760	1116760	Yeah, I know.
1116760	1118840	I know those cheap ones would be a lot harder to break.
1118840	1124680	Fine, how about like, you know, like kind of spinning around with it, throwing it javelin
1124680	1129360	style into a wood chipper, how about that?
1129360	1131200	Nice.
1131200	1132200	Will it blend?
1132200	1136960	Alright, so good, I'm glad the musician got to try some rock bands, so will you try it
1136960	1137960	again at some point?
1137960	1138960	Oh, it was so much fun.
1138960	1139960	It really was.
1139960	1140960	Awesome.
1140960	1141960	Awesome.
1141960	1142960	The harmony feature is really neat too.
1142960	1146360	Yeah, the harmony feature is kind of cool, because it's hard for some people to hear
1146360	1150120	the harmony, I think, and that takes a little while to kind of train your ears to be able
1150120	1154640	to hear that, so kind of to get that, again, instant feedback in a game like Rock Band,
1154640	1155900	which is what I really think it's all about.
1155900	1159960	It's more like that instant gratification, hey, I hit the right chord, or oh wow, I'm
1159960	1160960	way off.
1160960	1164720	And as I said, despite what I thought too, I mean, I wasn't as crazy as some of my other
1164720	1168640	friends, you have to appreciate the song to really enjoy the game, so it's a good way
1168640	1171560	of promoting music and enjoying music.
1171560	1174560	I have found some new bands through Rock Band.
1174560	1180160	Like there's a song I really like in Rock Band 3, Last Dance, and I'd never heard, I
1180160	1183320	think the band's like the Ravenettes or something, I'd never heard of them before, but I really
1183320	1184320	like the song.
1184320	1185320	I checked out their CD.
1185320	1186320	It's kind of cool.
1186320	1187320	So there you go.
1187320	1188320	All right.
1188320	1191920	My gaming week, I actually played a few different games this week, and a lot of that is thanks
1191920	1194840	to the Steam sale, but I'll get to that in a minute.
1194840	1197240	I did touch back on some of the games I played last week.
1197240	1200880	Now last week I'd only played demos, but this week I did just jump in and I bought the full
1200880	1205560	version of Super Meat Boy, which is, it's, it's pretty great.
1205560	1209840	I got to say it's, it's actually, I would go so far as to say it's one of the best arcade
1209840	1214080	games that is out there right now, period, like at all.
1214080	1217400	And I would have never thought that this game would fall in that category, but I love the
1217400	1224800	kind of like, I want to say it's almost like a WarioWare-ish game, but Mario style.
1224800	1230120	What I mean by that is that a lot of the levels in the game should take you no more than 30
1230120	1231320	seconds to beat.
1231320	1234260	And most of them are in the like 15 to 20 second range.
1234260	1239000	So it's really about like just learning the exact like right pattern to kind of beat a
1239000	1240000	level.
1240000	1241000	It's like playing an old Mega Man game or something.
1241000	1242080	I don't know.
1242080	1246680	I'm just having a lot of fun getting extraordinarily frustrated playing Super Meat Boy when I'm
1246680	1250480	like two seconds away from beating a level and just screwing it up.
1250480	1254520	And I got to tell you, Alan was watching me play and he would, he wants to watch me play
1254520	1258640	just to laugh at me getting so frustrated when I get so close to beating a level and
1258640	1262640	then I like, oops, fall in the gear and get Super Meat Boy all chopped up or whatever.
1262640	1265940	So yeah, I actually think Super Meat Boy is amazing.
1265940	1271680	My only, I guess, complaint is that I think in some ways it's almost too hard.
1271680	1275200	Like there's a lot of people that are going to buy Super Meat Boy that are never going
1275200	1278160	to get past the second level.
1278160	1283060	And it's kind of unfortunate, but if you keep with it, I mean that can also be the big reward
1283060	1284060	with it.
1284060	1285400	Did you get to check out the internet?
1285400	1287080	No, I haven't got there yet.
1287080	1289840	I don't know if that's towards the end or what, but I'm, I'm only on like the third
1289840	1290840	level.
1290840	1292360	It's taken me a long time to get there too.
1292360	1298040	I mean, it's, it's been quite a bit of a gaming time, so, uh, I will keep trying to get there.
1298040	1301700	I love the warp zones that take you to the retro style levels.
1301700	1305840	I thought that was amazing and it has like retro music and the soundtrack is astounding.
1305840	1308960	I'm going to, um, for the live listeners, I'll do some of the soundtrack for break tonight,
1308960	1310500	but the soundtrack is astounding.
1310500	1311840	It is great.
1311840	1313240	And it's all like indie stuff.
1313240	1316920	I think the guy who did the soundtracks not really done any other games before.
1316920	1319000	So it's, um, it's great.
1319000	1323400	There's really only one Xbox live arcade game I'm waiting for.
1323400	1327120	Um, and unfortunately I don't know when it's coming out.
1327120	1330200	The insanely twisted shadow planet.
1330200	1331200	Never heard of that.
1331200	1332600	You gotta watch the video for it.
1332600	1333600	Okay.
1333600	1334600	It's awesome.
1334600	1335600	Should I look it up right now?
1335600	1336600	What is it?
1336600	1337600	Okay.
1337600	1338600	It's got an awesome song that goes with it.
1338600	1339960	It's, um, I don't even know.
1339960	1343120	It's not really a shooter, but you play it like a UFO.
1343120	1349600	It's this guy, he's a really good artist and I'm loading up insanely twisted shadow planet
1349600	1350600	debut trailer.
1350600	1351600	I'm going to jump in the middle.
1351600	1352600	Awesome.
1352600	1354560	Um, song goes along with it.
1354560	1357160	I'm not hearing.
1357160	1368000	Oh, cause I, Oh, this kind of has that, um, it was that game limbo, not braid, but the
1368000	1378720	other artsy one now it's looking like an automate or something.
1378720	1379720	Planet's collide
1379720	1386920	like when they get down to the actual gameplay, well that's like UFOs flying this part of
1386920	1387920	the game with the UFOs flying.
1387920	1388920	Yeah.
1388920	1389920	That's all part of the game.
1389920	1390920	What is this?
1390920	1391920	An arcade release?
1391920	1404160	So it looks like you're like this little UFO and you're flying through different levels
1404160	1405160	and dodging obstacles.
1405160	1406160	Wow.
1406160	1407160	Something that's really good.
1407160	1408160	Okay.
1408160	1409160	Yeah.
1409160	1410160	The art style is pretty rad on this.
1410160	1411160	I like that.
1411160	1412160	All right.
1412160	1420040	Well, I don't, this can't be a very exciting radio, but that does look pretty cool.
1420040	1421040	I like that.
1421040	1424920	It's like a half shooter, half, almost like the same concept of super meat boy.
1424920	1427260	You're trying to get through a level, get through these tricky ways.
1427260	1428760	I'm going to paste the link there in chat.
1428760	1429760	Sorry.
1429760	1432360	The folks listening on podcasts, but you won't be able to get that link, but just look for
1432360	1434760	insanely twisted shadow planet.
1434760	1435760	Interesting.
1435760	1437480	All right.
1437480	1443760	Uh, also I played more Pac-Man championship edition deluxe, which, uh, I love there's,
1443760	1448600	there's very, very satisfying, uh, rewards when you gobble up a train of 30 ghosts, uh,
1448600	1449840	I get the high score.
1449840	1451640	Uh, again, the music's great.
1451640	1455120	Kind of the same stuff I was saying last week, buying the retail version didn't really change
1455120	1456120	my opinions there.
1456120	1460680	I still think it's, it's a worthy upgrade if you like the last one, um, new games I
1460680	1463640	played this week, thanks to a steam and some of the sales going on there.
1463640	1467200	I did finally play poker night at the inventory cause that finally came out, which is the
1467200	1472220	Texas hold and poker game that features, um, uh, like some of the characters that you see
1472220	1479080	in various telltale games and, uh, valve really cause heavy from team fortress is in there.
1479080	1481600	Tycho is in there and strong bad.
1481600	1488440	So, um, it's a Texas hold them game and I've, it's, it's really kind of, that's it.
1488440	1490840	It's really a no frills poker game.
1490840	1492920	There's not a whole lot of modes.
1492920	1495100	There is not a multiplayer.
1495100	1498040	So you might be wondering, well then why would I bother with this game?
1498040	1499760	Well, a it's $5, right?
1499760	1503520	I think it's only $5 to get this game and a 10 at most.
1503520	1505000	I think it's only five though.
1505000	1506680	And there was a lot of sales going on during the pre-order.
1506680	1508840	I think I paid five for it like two months ago.
1508840	1509840	Yeah.
1509840	1511120	It's, it's very, very cheap.
1511120	1516620	And uh, it's mostly like, I think of it as like an interactive comic strip in a way because
1516620	1520000	the strength of the game is really in the writing and in the voice acting.
1520000	1525820	And about 98% of that all comes back to strong bad, uh, pretty much anytime strong bad says
1525820	1527480	something it's pretty fucking funny.
1527480	1532080	Uh, the rest of it, like the heavy and, and the, the, the max I can kind of give and take.
1532080	1537240	But uh, yeah, I loved a strong bad Tycho's all right, but I dunno, there's something
1537240	1541400	about him where like he comes off as a real smug asshole in the game and like, I don't
1541400	1542400	know when I read...
1542400	1543400	That's exactly his character.
1543400	1549500	Yes, but I don't know when I read Penny Arcade, I don't quite get it as strong as I get it
1549500	1551400	in the Poker Night game.
1551400	1553400	Even better if it was Gabe.
1553400	1554740	But it was, it was fine.
1554740	1555740	It's fine.
1555740	1561840	I mean for a $5 poker game, I more look at it as you're buying laughs.
1561840	1565800	If you want an actual poker game, this is not the game to get.
1565800	1566800	It's not.
1566800	1569040	It's a very no frills, low thing.
1569040	1572800	But if you want something that's, I'm gonna laugh.
1572800	1575960	I'm gonna waste a little time and have fun with this.
1575960	1578160	That's where, you know, $5 is a pretty damn good deal.
1578160	1581880	If they were trying to charge like 30 though for this, I'd say no way.
1581880	1582880	No way.
1582880	1585080	But $5 is really hard to argue with.
1585080	1587440	So the price is right on this one.
1587440	1592740	Um, but don't expect a lot of modes and extra stuff unless, unless there's like unlockable
1592740	1596440	things that I haven't found yet, which I wouldn't doubt at all, actually.
1596440	1598240	Like Latas in there and stuff.
1598240	1602280	I wouldn't doubt at all that there'd be some hidden shit in there that I just haven't found
1602280	1603280	yet and that's fine.
1603280	1605620	I, I didn't, you know, I actually bought the game.
1605620	1609240	I didn't get a review copy that has the little sheet that tells you how to get all the unlocks
1609240	1611840	that a lot of publishers do.
1611840	1618320	Anyhow, also another game that I got, um, Recettear, an item shop's tale, I think was
1618320	1620320	the name of the game.
1620320	1627160	It's, it's a PC version of a game that looks like it was done on the PlayStation 1.
1627160	1631840	And I don't know if it was like translated or what the deal is, but I mean, Alan summed
1631840	1632960	it up perfectly.
1632960	1635720	He was looking at it going, this game is so weeaboo.
1635720	1638000	Like and that's really what it is.
1638000	1643560	It's just this very like chibi, teehee, I'm playing a dumb girl that's opening an item
1643560	1649640	shop and I have this little fairy that helps navigate me through the complex item shop
1649640	1653720	stuff and we go to the village and find a hero to take us through the dungeons.
1653720	1655580	Like it's just like, oh my God, I'm going to barf.
1655580	1658560	This is so like just stupid.
1658560	1663480	But I will say one thing I liked about it, well, A, I bought it in a pack of like five
1663480	1665060	games for five bucks.
1665060	1669340	So like considering I paid a whole dollar for Recettear, it's hard to complain.
1669340	1676840	But B, I actually really like the idea of the game because the idea of the game is that
1676840	1683200	you're not the hero, you run the item shop in a hero's game.
1683200	1684200	It's on my wish list.
1684200	1688400	Which is kind of, oh, it's a bummer you didn't sign in a couple days ago and it was on sale
1688400	1689400	for like five bucks.
1689400	1691560	I've been too busy having fun with Marissa.
1691560	1693880	I guess that's fair enough.
1693880	1697040	Having pillow fights and talking about boobies.
1697040	1698840	All right.
1698840	1702840	So yeah, Recettear, I honestly would not pay more than five dollars for this game.
1702840	1705880	And even then it's like, you might want to check out a demo first to see if it's really
1705880	1706920	for you.
1706920	1710680	But some of the like, okay, I didn't even really describe the game.
1710680	1713400	I'm all over the place tonight, guys, sorry.
1713400	1718440	You run an item shop and so you can buy and sell things.
1718440	1723600	You can buy things from people to come in or you can sell things that you find in dungeons.
1723600	1728560	And in order to go into a dungeon, you hire a hero to go into the dungeon for you.
1728560	1733560	And I don't know, they somehow write this into the very chibi story that the item shop
1733560	1737400	girl is protected and she can't get hit by the monsters, but the hero can.
1737400	1740000	But the item shop girl will collect all the items.
1740000	1744680	So it's like you go dungeon exploring, collect all this trash that you sell in your shop.
1744680	1746480	And then it gets more complicated later on.
1746480	1750120	You can like fuse things together and make like, you know, super coconuts and whatever
1750120	1755360	it is that, you know, you sell coconuts, you sell in an item shop and like Uber mushrooms.
1755360	1759880	I mean, swallows carry a super coconut.
1759880	1761080	I don't know.
1761080	1765240	So is it an African swallow or European swallow?
1765240	1769840	I'm looking in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com and some of the folks talking about Poker Night
1769840	1771240	at the inventory.
1771240	1774000	Deathwishing says, Skye, there's Team Fortress 2 hats.
1774000	1777280	Yes, I have heard that there are unlocks for other games in it.
1777280	1778360	I did miss that.
1778360	1779920	So yeah, that's correct.
1779920	1782560	You can unlock some items that show up in other games.
1782560	1784600	It's pretty cool.
1784600	1786080	Brakeman in chat says, what the fuck?
1786080	1788540	Skye buys his games after heavily drinking.
1788540	1791160	I don't think I was drinking heavily when I bought that game, actually.
1791160	1793160	So there you go.
1793160	1794160	All right.
1794160	1795160	Anyhow.
1795160	1796160	Yeah.
1796160	1800840	So Recettear is, if you like those like chibi import PlayStation 1 games, then this is right
1800840	1801840	up your alley.
1801840	1804980	But if you're looking for like a serious RPG, don't bother.
1804980	1805980	But I like the concept.
1805980	1811160	I like that idea that you're not always the hero, that sometimes you're the girl running
1811160	1813720	the item shop who's kind of a ditz.
1813720	1814720	Fun.
1814720	1819520	So let's move on into housekeeping tonight before we get into the news.
1819520	1822680	In our housekeeping tonight, we still have shows scheduled through the end of the year.
1822680	1824760	We don't have any weeks off or anything.
1824760	1829120	Sadly, it does not look like Dark Soccer and I are going to be taking a trip mid-December
1829120	1832640	as we originally planned because stupid economy and all that stuff.
1832640	1838320	But that's why we had to get Marissa up here this time.
1838320	1841120	But we will still be bringing you much OLR through the rest of the year.
1841120	1844520	If you like the show and we hope you do, please consider adding us on Twitter.
1844520	1847480	We're also on Facebook.
1847480	1849880	You can like us at Orange Lounge Radio.
1849880	1852520	Just search for that and we should come right up.
1852520	1854340	We always want more fans on Facebook.
1854340	1858880	It helps us spread the word about our show because we don't have big budgets of advertising
1858880	1860360	dollars or any of that good stuff.
1860360	1862520	All right, let's talk about the news this week.
1862520	1865520	Believe it or not, there was still quite a bit of news going on even though it was a
1865520	1866520	holiday week.
1866520	1867800	So let's get into it.
1867800	1868800	Loki.
1868800	1869800	There was some news, yes.
1869800	1872760	Not a lot of huge stuff, but interesting things.
1872760	1877040	Mainly just news about Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which we don't really need the cover
1877040	1881400	because Black Friday's already passed and Cyber Monday, well, why even bother?
1881400	1886100	Because by the time you hear this, it'll probably be too late anyways.
1886100	1890500	We haven't reported on PSP firmware updates in a while, probably because a lot of people
1890500	1893080	have kind of written off the PSP.
1893080	1901880	But anyways, there is a firmware update, 6.35, and it adds Curiosity, which I guess is a
1901880	1910000	new music streaming service called Music Unlimited, which I guess is powered by Curiosity, and
1910000	1913120	that's something that was announced back in September.
1913120	1918960	And then of course, also in Japan, they're getting something called XRadar, which looks
1918960	1924280	like some sort of GPS mapping software or something like that.
1924280	1926280	This has been around in Japan for a long time, right?
1926280	1929760	It seems like during Japanese releases, I'm always talking about some type of navigational
1929760	1932360	thing that's coming out on the PSP over there.
1932360	1935520	I feel like this is something that's been in there a while, or maybe it's like a newer
1935520	1936520	technology, I don't know.
1936520	1942680	Well, they've had a GPS add-on for a long time, and I want to say that I believe all
1942680	1947480	the other regions have support for it, but they've just never sold it over here, which
1947480	1952600	is too bad because that'd be pretty awesome to have GPS on, you know, a PSP might make
1952600	1959040	it kind of worth it, but at this point I think they've just given up on it.
1959040	1964440	And I'm also assuming that there's some sort of fixes for, you know, software hacks and
1964440	1969960	stuff like that in there, because that's always something that, you know, they kind of do.
1969960	1972840	But that is available, I believe now.
1972840	1973840	So neat.
1973840	1982800	It's kind of late, if you ask me, though, to add a music service to the PSP, considering,
1982800	1986640	I mean, it's almost at the end of its life cycle.
1986640	1990520	Or are you saying that just because we've had all this talk about PSP2 news lately?
1990520	1992600	It's gonna be announced next year, I mean, come on.
1992600	1994720	Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's coming out next year.
1994720	1997000	Oh, it's coming out, I bet you, by holiday next year.
1997000	1999080	Okay, well that's still one year away from today.
1999080	2003340	That's still at the end of its life cycle, I mean, what big games have they announced
2003340	2005440	for the PSP that haven't come out yet?
2005440	2009440	Well, they're kind of still being powered by some of the big titles that came out, like
2009440	2013800	that Kingdom Hearts game is pretty beautiful, if you kind of see it.
2013800	2017800	Yeah, but I mean, come on, like, the only things that they had come out in November
2017800	2023640	that were worthwhile, I guess, the new God of War game, Ghost of Sparta, which, I mean,
2023640	2030360	come on, it's, how many prequel games to the God of War series do we really need, I mean?
2030360	2034880	And then they did have another Ghost Recon game come out on the PSP, but there's not
2034880	2039920	a lot of other things that are available for the PSP that are kind of worthwhile.
2039920	2044040	It's really slowing down.
2044040	2048520	So I don't, I don't really know, I'm just assuming it's gonna be kind of going away
2048520	2051000	at some point very soon.
2051000	2055640	Breakman in our chatroom at chat.orangetoloungeradio.com, as we tape live on this Sunday evening, asks,
2055640	2059400	I thought they were gonna heavily market the PSP this year, didn't they get a kid to be
2059400	2060400	the face of the PSP?
2060400	2062880	I haven't seen a PSP commercial in a long time.
2062880	2065920	Yeah, thank God, because he's so fucking annoying.
2065920	2069320	Well, is that maybe because their big focus this year has been on the move, that they
2069320	2070960	really want to sell the PlayStation Move?
2070960	2075520	They are really trying to focus on marketing the PSP, but the stuff that they're focusing
2075520	2082780	on, it's just like catalog titles and, you know, just, you know, what small releases
2082780	2083780	that they have coming out.
2083780	2087740	I mean, what, or I shouldn't say small, what few releases they have coming out, I mean,
2087740	2092400	their big marketing campaign is, hey look, we got these old games that are $10 now.
2092400	2096880	I mean, that's great, I guess, you know, these games that have been out for a long time.
2096880	2100400	I mean, really, do we need to be marketing ModNation erasers still?
2100400	2102760	I mean, that game came out six months ago.
2102760	2109600	AkumaJP in our chatroom says Monster Hunter 3rd is big here, he lives over in Japan, so.
2109600	2114760	Well that's in Japan, yeah, Monster Hunter does okay over here, I think, but I'm sure
2114760	2119020	that's gonna be coming out probably next year at some point, but it just, it's not a big,
2119020	2121520	as big of a deal here as it is in Japan.
2121520	2126520	I mean, Monster Hunter tried it alright on the Wii, but there's just not a lot of stuff.
2126520	2131080	It's just, you know, it's a handful of titles that are coming out each year for the PSP,
2131080	2133920	and that's really sad compared to what's coming out in the DS.
2133920	2138200	Granted, the DS also gets a lot of crap that comes out for it, but, I mean, even these
2138200	2142080	companies that put out crap aren't even spending their time on the PSP.
2142080	2148800	I mean, if you have the shovelware makers avoiding your platform, that's bad.
2148800	2152840	DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom says, I'm still wondering when Kingdom Hearts 3 itself
2152840	2153840	will come out.
2153840	2156880	I believe a lot of that is tied to Final Fantasy XIII Versus.
2156880	2162120	If I remember right, it's the same team that usually does the Kingdom Hearts games.
2162120	2166360	Part of the reason Kingdom Hearts 3 has been so unheard of is because Kingdom Hearts, or
2166360	2169720	I'm sorry, Final Fantasy XIII Versus has taken so long.
2169720	2173760	Next Kingdom Hearts game is also gonna be on DS, recoded, so.
2173760	2177680	Well then there's the 3DS title too they've got in the works, right?
2177680	2180080	Yes, there is a 3DS title in the works as well.
2180080	2186600	I mean, once the 3DS comes out, I think it's just gonna be the final blow for the PSP.
2186600	2190480	Until they announce the PSP 2, then that might pick things up, but as far as the original
2190480	2191480	PSP...
2191480	2193600	Especially with these rumors that it might be the phone as well, is gonna, I think, invigorate
2193600	2194600	a little bit.
2194600	2195600	I think it's gonna be something separate.
2195600	2197480	I don't think it's gonna be a phone integrated into it.
2197480	2202280	I can see it's something like the iPod Touch or something where it has many of the features
2202280	2206160	of the phone minus the phone, you know, like the whole marketplace and stuff.
2206160	2212040	They're probably gonna try to emulate a lot of that stuff, but I don't know.
2212040	2217840	I guess if you have a PSP, you know, neat that they have another update, which will
2217840	2222280	probably be cracked in a few days anyways.
2222280	2226920	But I mean, there's not a lot of titles on the horizon for you guys, unfortunately.
2226920	2231240	But hey, just wait, don't be tempted by some of these Black Friday sales, which I did see
2231240	2236800	they had one as a PSP Go for $150 and it came with three games, including like Little Big
2236800	2239240	Planet and stuff like that.
2239240	2241880	So that's kind of cool.
2241880	2246440	But once again, they're just trying to sucker you in so they can clear out inventory.
2246440	2249760	And really, do you want a PSP Go when it's at the end of its life cycle?
2249760	2253560	See here's the thing, the solar flare in our chatroom says, I never regret getting my PSP.
2253560	2259340	And I still think if you don't have a PSP after all this time still, I still think there's
2259340	2264680	a great back catalog of games that are getting cheaper by the day, as the console is nearing
2264680	2265680	the end of its life cycle.
2265680	2267880	I think it's definitely worth looking to go get.
2267880	2271660	And let's not forget, I've always said, and I think you guys agree, that the PSP's biggest
2271660	2275640	strength is not necessarily its games library, although that's gotten a lot better, but the
2275640	2282520	fact that the PSP also plays MP3s, does the movies, does the internets, does...
2282520	2287320	That's the problem though with the PSP though, is all that stuff, even nowadays with the
2287320	2291080	new technology that's out there, with the new smartphones and everything, it's getting
2291080	2292080	really weak.
2292080	2296680	That's a weak argument now, because before it was like, hey, yeah, I can browse the web,
2296680	2300720	and yeah, the web browser's kind of crappy, it doesn't support a lot of things, you know.
2300720	2306280	But now, I mean, a lot of the smartphones and stuff that are coming out, that comparison's
2306280	2309680	no longer really valid, because everything plays MP3s now.
2309680	2311900	Everything watches movies.
2311900	2312900	Everything can...
2312900	2318840	If you're a gamer, you can't look at the iPhone games and take any of them seriously.
2318840	2325520	99% of them suck, especially the ones that are like bad, bad, bad ports of real games.
2325520	2328600	That's true, but also 99% of them are under $20.
2328600	2330480	Hold on, I think Jamie wanted to jump in here.
2330480	2335960	No, I was just gonna say, I've been enjoying Final Fantasy II and VI and a lot of games
2335960	2336960	on there.
2336960	2340480	But I still think Final Fantasy II is better on the PSP.
2340480	2342480	Yes, because it has buttons.
2342480	2343480	Yes.
2343480	2344480	Yes, exactly.
2344480	2345480	Exactly.
2345480	2346480	Their argument, you know, does stand...
2346480	2347480	But I get it.
2347480	2348480	You're right.
2348480	2349480	The price is huge, too.
2349480	2350480	It's kind of cool, though.
2350480	2353360	One of the things, actually, I forgot to mention that I did this week, as far as my game stuff,
2353360	2358600	because I do have a jailbroken iPod, I downloaded an NES emulator on it, which is kind of neat.
2358600	2363540	But what's neat about it is you can actually, it has support for, via Bluetooth, to sync
2363540	2369400	a Wii remote to it, to use the Wii remote to play the NES games on.
2369400	2371280	Just totally random tangent question.
2371280	2374440	I want to ask Marissa so she doesn't feel left out here, because the Wii is supposed
2374440	2380280	to be that system that gets everybody, no matter if you're a gamer or not, it's supposed
2380280	2381280	to reach out to everybody.
2381280	2382800	Have you ever played the Wii?
2382800	2383800	Oh, yeah.
2383800	2387680	Yeah, my dad has the Wii, and he likes my boyfriend to come over to play Mario with
2387680	2389320	him so he can finally progress in levels.
2389320	2392800	Now, your boyfriend doesn't try to get you to play Wii Fit while he sits behind you with
2392800	2393800	a camera, right?
2393800	2394800	No, but it was...
2394800	2395800	Okay, just checking.
2395800	2397600	It was funny.
2397600	2402320	My dad thought that yoga was for wussies.
2402320	2403320	The yoga Wii Fit is hard?
2403320	2404320	Oh, wait, we're on the internet.
2404320	2407840	My dad, he thought yoga was for pussies until he tried the Wii Fit yoga.
2407840	2409720	Oh, you can say naughty language on the show.
2409720	2410720	Oh, yes.
2410720	2411720	The internet is for porn, so we're not...
2411720	2412720	That's right.
2412720	2417520	No, I've played the Wii, but I think the interesting thing is that so many games have come out
2417520	2422680	now that's not just the emphasis on the shtick of using the motion control anymore.
2422680	2425200	Which is what a lot of us wanted in the very beginning, actually.
2425200	2428840	Okay, yay, we get it, there's motion control, now don't go overboard with it.
2428840	2429840	No, don't.
2429840	2430840	Stop, stop, you're getting too close to the edge.
2430840	2431840	Stop!
2431840	2433320	Hey, you know, it's better than the...
2433320	2436880	At least the controller's better than the Gamecock, so the PS...
2436880	2439840	You know there was actually a game company called Gamecock?
2439840	2441680	I don't even know if they're still around.
2441680	2443680	I think I heard something about them shutting down.
2443680	2444680	They're terrible.
2444680	2446680	Didn't they do the Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game?
2446680	2448160	That was like their big thing?
2448160	2449160	Yeah.
2449160	2451240	Anyhow, moving on.
2451240	2454280	Let's talk about some other gaming news that doesn't have to do with the PSP.
2454280	2455280	Let's talk about the Kinect.
2455280	2459880	We were talking about Japanese and the way things were received in Japan a minute ago.
2459880	2461600	How about the Kinect launch in Japan?
2461600	2468800	Well, in Japan, Microsoft's new Kinect sold 26,000 units during the launch weekend of
2468800	2470200	November 20th.
2470200	2473600	That includes both standalone and 360-bundle Kinects.
2473600	2479060	Now here's something to keep in mind, it sold a million of them, I believe, in the rest
2479060	2480060	of the world.
2480060	2482360	And it sold 26,000 in Japan.
2482360	2484500	Now there's a few ways you can kind of break down these numbers.
2484500	2488080	There's a lot of people that want to jump in there and go, oh, well these numbers mean
2488080	2490940	the Kinect is a total hardcore failure in Japan.
2490940	2494320	But then there's another group that goes, well, it's not like the 360 was selling a
2494320	2501240	bunch in Japan anyway, so the fact that it sold 26,000 is actually pretty good, considering
2501240	2503900	the user base that exists compared to the rest of the world.
2503900	2508000	So there's a million ways you can kind of slice it, but regardless, that's what it is.
2508000	2511360	What I also thought was very interesting, especially to a lot of the audience of this
2511360	2516200	show, guess what the highest-selling launch title was in Japan?
2516200	2521080	It was Dance Masters, was the highest-selling launch title in Japan, 6,000 copies of Dance
2521080	2522080	Masters.
2522080	2523080	That sounds surprising.
2523080	2524080	They like their Para Para.
2524080	2527480	Well, keep in mind, they also don't have Dance Central, because Dance Central was a very
2527480	2533460	kind of American type of game, especially when it comes to the licenses.
2533460	2539080	Being that Dance Masters relied pretty much completely on Konami originals and Avex songs
2539080	2543400	that I'm sure were dirt cheap to license here in the US, you pretty much have the same game
2543400	2545280	overseas that you have here.
2545280	2548320	So very interesting, the way that worked out.
2548320	2555300	But that almost sounds to me like I'm not so sure the Kinect in Japan has that must-have
2555300	2556300	title.
2556300	2562300	I mean, not to slam on Dance Masters, but I think that a game like Dance Central, maybe
2562300	2567240	localized with J-pop hits and songs that are big in Japan, might do well.
2567240	2571040	I mean, heck, probably even a lot of the songs that are in it already, I know there's a lot
2571040	2576680	of the kind of cross-culture going on there, probably would do a lot better.
2576680	2579120	So I don't know, I'm kind of interested.
2579120	2581120	Does anybody kind of read into those numbers at all?
2581120	2583080	What do you guys think about those numbers?
2583080	2585200	Is that a good launch, or is that a shitty launch?
2585200	2589480	Well, they just have a really small install base in Japan, so I'm not surprised that the
2589480	2597000	numbers are a lot smaller than we have over here in the North American regions.
2597000	2600720	Let's say that's not bad, considering.
2600720	2601720	So we'll see.
2601720	2607160	I mean, it's so interesting now, kind of where we're at in this generation, where the PlayStation
2607160	2610560	is such the bigger deal over in Japan, I'd be more curious, and I haven't seen these
2610560	2614020	numbers yet, as to how the move is doing over there compared to here, because I bet it's
2614020	2615020	doing better.
2615020	2619080	It is doing way better than that, because there's more of an installed base.
2619080	2620080	Right.
2620080	2623880	But is it doing better there than it is here, comparatively?
2623880	2624880	I don't think so.
2624880	2625880	Hmm.
2625880	2627040	I'd be curious.
2627040	2632360	Anyway, that's all I really had, Kinect launched in Japan, and we'll see what games come out
2632360	2637080	over there, and what all gets localized for Japan, or vice versa, perhaps.
2637080	2639360	I just actually found something really sad just now.
2639360	2640360	What's that?
2640360	2641360	Leslie Nielsen died.
2641360	2642360	Oh no!
2642360	2643360	The guy from Airplane?
2643360	2644360	The Naked Gun?
2644360	2645360	Yeah.
2645360	2646360	No!
2646360	2647360	He was getting really old, I mean.
2647360	2650360	Yeah, but I just happened to look and- That's horrible.
2650360	2651360	Sad.
2651360	2652360	That's a bummer.
2652360	2653360	Yeah, he was funny.
2653360	2654560	Way to bring down the show.
2654560	2657120	How about some happy news?
2657120	2660160	Let's talk about Marisa's boobs some more, that'll cheer me up.
2660160	2661920	So Marisa- No, I'm kidding.
2661920	2664280	I can see your dirty pillows.
2664280	2669240	Actually, my gamer news is that Eidos needs to- well, Eidos is dead now.
2669240	2672600	I'm still waiting for Thief 4 for the rest of Eternity, and it looks like they're implying
2672600	2675280	that they're gonna get rid of Garrett and make it a girl, and I'm pissed.
2675280	2679600	Well, Eidos kinda got sucked into Square Enix, because like, you know, Tomb Raider is still
2679600	2682360	getting cranked out, but it's now by Square Enix.
2682360	2688400	And actually, the last arcade game they did anyway was really good, so, you know, there's
2688400	2689400	always hope.
2689400	2692400	You know, cross those fingers.
2692400	2693400	How about something happy?
2693400	2695120	How about something happy?
2695120	2699720	Well, BBC America is having programming available on PlayStation Network.
2699720	2705880	There will be the first episode of the US version of Top Gear, which is normally $1.99
2705880	2713320	SD or $2.99 HD, and that's gonna be up there for the first two weeks for free, and Dan
2713320	2714600	said it was actually really good.
2714600	2718520	He's a big Top Gear fan, so he said it was really up there.
2718520	2719720	It gets the Dan stamp of approval.
2719720	2721280	It gets the Dan stamp of approval.
2721280	2722280	Very nice.
2722280	2729720	Also, Doctor Who and Being Human will be up there on the launch list, and I'm sure everyone's
2729720	2734400	heard me go off about Doctor Who, about how awesome it is, but Being Human is a really,
2734400	2735400	really cool show.
2735400	2742520	It sounds kind of cheesy about a werewolf and his vampire friend moving into a flat
2742520	2746560	that happens to be haunted by this girl that was killed there.
2746560	2749640	So yeah, a werewolf, a ghost, and a vampire live together.
2749640	2751360	Walk into a bar?
2751360	2752360	No.
2752360	2753360	Oh.
2753360	2755480	But actually, it's a really good drama.
2755480	2760480	I actually really like it, so it's one I recommend to people to watch, but they're gonna be adding
2760480	2764520	more BBC shows on there.
2764520	2766520	I'm hoping to see Primeval show up.
2766520	2768280	That's another good show.
2768280	2770200	So that's really cool.
2770200	2771240	That makes me happy.
2771240	2774440	That means that I actually have a reason to use my PlayStation Store since I don't have
2774440	2776680	cable.
2776680	2777680	Just cable internets.
2777680	2782280	Then again, I also have the internet.
2782280	2783280	Shh.
2783280	2786840	We're not supposed to be encouraging that here on this program.
2786840	2788240	What are you talking about?
2788240	2789440	Just watch streaming BBC TV.
2789440	2791440	There you go.
2791440	2795200	So the chat room is kind of reacting to the whole news about Leslie Nielsen.
2795200	2797680	He's 84 years old.
2797680	2799160	I didn't realize he was that old.
2799160	2800440	He was old.
2800440	2803720	He was at least 60 when those Naked Gun movies came out in the 90s.
2803720	2805600	But he didn't age ever.
2805600	2808080	He's on our chat room, says, Happy news.
2808080	2811640	Leslie Nielsen is now a zombie, and there's a new Naked Gun in the works.
2811640	2812640	So there you go.
2812640	2813640	Oh, that's...
2813640	2816960	It'll probably be funnier than the last one.
2816960	2818200	The last one was awesome.
2818200	2820840	Last one had OJ Simpson in upset.
2820840	2822120	They all had OJ Simpson.
2822120	2824640	He was funny back then.
2824640	2826080	The last movie he did was...
2826080	2829360	I don't even remember what the hell it was called, but it ended up where he was some
2829360	2835640	sort of detective on the moon or something like that, and there was some weird shit.
2835640	2838780	The only movie that I think he's done that I really didn't care for was Dracula Dead
2838780	2842120	and Loving It, which is also sad because it was a Mel Brooks movie, too, and it wasn't
2842120	2844120	all that good.
2844120	2845120	Sadness.
2845120	2849380	I can't say that there was a movie that he did that I did not like.
2849380	2856080	I'd say maybe Mr. Magoo, but I never watched that, but I don't really care for Mr. Magoo.
2856080	2859120	They said he was being treated for pneumonia.
2859120	2860120	Aww.
2860120	2861880	Damn you, pneumonia!
2861880	2862880	Damn you!
2862880	2865560	Can you believe that Zsa Zsa Gabor outlived him?
2865560	2866560	Like, damn it!
2866560	2867560	Really?
2867560	2868560	Take her instead!
2868560	2871920	No, I mean, she's had one foot in for, like, how many months now?
2871920	2875920	I mean, not to sound horrible and crass, but, like, there's all these, like, pictures of
2875920	2879680	her on the internets, like, just not looking good at all.
2879680	2883400	Pneumonia, you know you have a target now.
2883400	2884760	Take out Zsa Zsa.
2884760	2885760	Stop.
2885760	2886760	Stop.
2886760	2888920	You don't encourage that sort of thing to happen to old ladies.
2888920	2890920	It's Zsa Zsa Gabor!
2890920	2892320	Come on!
2892320	2893320	Seriously.
2893320	2894320	Wow.
2894320	2895320	Alright.
2895320	2896320	Let's move on, please.
2896320	2897320	Next.
2897320	2898320	Video games, hello, video games.
2898320	2902840	I mean, she's like the Paris Hilton of a long time ago.
2902840	2903840	Completely pointless.
2903840	2908400	Married nine times.
2908400	2912880	Kinect support is coming to the XNA in the future.
2912880	2919720	Apparently, developers will be getting the tools to make games supporting the Kinect.
2919720	2921720	Just not right now.
2921720	2928560	They said that they're pleased to see developers tinkering around with, to a degree, the device,
2928560	2935040	and, of course, they're saying that Microsoft classifies as someone accessing algorithms
2935040	2940240	on the side of the Xbox for ill use or someone explaining the Kinect in a cheating manner
2940240	2941240	not tolerable.
2941240	2946520	Of course, they're saying, you know, creating a driver that might open the USB connection
2946520	2952200	or, you know, read C inputs from the sensor, on the other hand, are totally cool with Microsoft.
2952200	2956520	They're kind of referring to, you know, some of the homebrew hacks that people have done
2956520	2964240	on their PC, and they said they have no timetable when Kinect support will come to the XNA,
2964240	2968880	but it possibly will, so.
2968880	2974000	I imagine they will at some point, I mean, they're gonna want people, you know, taking
2974000	2976160	advantage of their peripherals.
2976160	2982760	That'd be like saying, you know, we're not really gonna give you the algorithms and the
2982760	2986840	device drivers to use our controllers, but you can make games.
2986840	2989360	You just can't have anything to control them.
2989360	2993280	You know, maybe they're afraid that the indie developers are gonna make better games than
2993280	2994280	what's out there right now.
2994280	2996020	That wouldn't be that difficult.
2996020	3000320	When you open it up to the public, there's gonna be all those ideas, you know, and there's
3000320	3003760	gonna be somebody that thinks of something that the publishers have been too afraid to
3003760	3006680	do and are gonna come up with that must-have game.
3006680	3008840	You know what I mean?
3008840	3012120	Which reminds me, we actually need to do, we need to do something a little bit out of
3012120	3015000	order and out of character here on Orange Laundraido, but I need to go to the Twitters
3015000	3016800	real quick.
3016800	3019240	I'm actually going to Twitter topics a little bit early in the show.
3019240	3023120	I'm not gonna do them all, but there's one particular Twitter that caught my attention
3023120	3026480	before the show tonight, and it has to do with XNA and all this stuff.
3026480	3029880	So I'm going to the Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and I want to read some tweets from
3029880	3030880	Blue Swim.
3030880	3032880	Hey, you ready?
3032880	3035080	Blue Swim had asked us a question on Twitter.
3035080	3041880	Have any of you played the Xbox Live indie game, Techno Kitten Adventure?
3041880	3048680	Kitten plus jetpack plus club music plus rainbows plus pink ponies equals win.
3048680	3053920	And he actually sent us a little YouTube here of what the game in motion looks like.
3053920	3058440	And of course, that doesn't make for great radio, but just to give you an idea, here's
3058440	3062600	what the soundtrack sounds like.
3062600	3073240	Now, to tell you what's going on in the game, there's a little kitten on a jetpack flying
3073240	3079560	through different obstacles, and he's dodging these pink unicorns that are flying at him,
3079560	3084240	and these UFOs, and falling stars, which are referenced in the song, if you listen to the
3084240	3087440	lyrics of the song, and these little boats with color tracks.
3087440	3088960	I don't think he actually has to dodge all that.
3088960	3091200	I think it's just the blocks that he has to dodge.
3091200	3093320	The rest is just background.
3093320	3098960	This is kind of like robot unicorn attack, but like 10 times more awesome.
3098960	3104640	I like the stars.
3104640	3108120	And whenever he crashes into objects, he goes, meow.
3108120	3110240	Look at the high scores.
3110240	3113240	It's like a bad like, what is it, YTMD or something.
3113240	3116360	If you were high, this game would just make you pass out.
3116360	3119080	Like seriously, I just don't even know.
3119080	3125040	So my point is, this is quite possibly the most amazing thing I've ever seen someone
3125040	3127360	do on the Xbox 360.
3127360	3132040	And it's on the Indie, in fact, I've decided we are going to track this guy down and get
3132040	3136200	him on the show, whoever made this game, because I need to know more about this right now.
3136200	3138240	Right now.
3138240	3145120	And obviously, the publishers and the big Activisions and EAs of the world are too afraid
3145120	3152520	of Techno Kitten Adventure and getting their, you know, multi-millions from I'm sure what
3152520	3155880	this is going to sell on the Indie marketplace.
3155880	3156880	Amazing.
3156880	3157880	Techno Kitten Adventure.
3157880	3158880	There you go.
3158880	3161880	God damn, that was amazing.
3161880	3163160	Thank you to Blue Swim for pointing that out.
3163160	3166520	I am immediately going home and buying that after the show, just so you know.
3166520	3168520	I will too buy that.
3168520	3169520	Look at that.
3169520	3170520	Look at that.
3170520	3173840	You just sold two copies off that game and how hard could that game have possibly been
3173840	3174840	to me?
3174840	3177120	It was a thing off of X and A for a long time.
3177120	3183520	But it was an idea that no one else had thought of yet or was too afraid to do.
3183520	3185000	I don't know.
3185000	3186000	And I won't.
3186000	3188760	That game, that game scared Shermie out of the room.
3188760	3190000	Hold on.
3190000	3193400	Oh, the chatters are like, what is this link now?
3193400	3194400	Send us link.
3194400	3195400	Here you go.
3195400	3196400	I'll give you the same link Blue Swim gave me.
3196400	3197400	There you go.
3197400	3198400	I'll put watch now.
3198400	3199400	All right.
3199400	3200400	There you go.
3200400	3202400	I just put that there.
3202400	3206200	Yizam in the chat says, President Jetpack Cat.
3206200	3209880	Act F says, we have our new president cat and it has a jetpack.
3209880	3212560	Orange Right says, Jetpack Cat.
3212560	3213800	Sure.
3213800	3214800	We endorse this.
3214800	3217440	Jetpack Cat.
3217440	3218440	President Cat's cousin.
3218440	3221640	In fact, I will make a tweet right now.
3221640	3222640	Right now.
3222640	3224000	President Cat's cousin, Jetpack Cat.
3224000	3226440	You must get this game right now.
3226440	3227440	There you go.
3227440	3228440	Some, some indie guy is going to be like WTF.
3228440	3229440	All right.
3229440	3232080	Anyhow, let me get into another story here.
3232080	3238360	There's a link right there and a chat, Alphana Kananagram did a, you know, cause now you can
3238360	3240820	of course set everything up to download.
3240820	3241820	Thank you.
3241820	3245040	See, you know, what's funny is that like half our listeners are going to buy it tonight
3245040	3248640	and then like the guy's going to go in like, wait, how did I sell all these games last
3248640	3249640	night?
3249640	3250640	All right.
3250640	3254760	Put that link on our website, then you can see the refers.
3254760	3256040	Going viral kids.
3256040	3257040	All right.
3257040	3258040	Anyhow.
3258040	3260240	Um, moving on to something completely different.
3260240	3264880	This is like, like after that last little game, this seems like such shit.
3264880	3266120	This is about 3d games.
3266120	3268200	Like I don't even care about 3d games anymore.
3268200	3271200	If they don't have jet pack kittens who fucking cares.
3271200	3272200	But whatever.
3272200	3274360	Sony seems to think that 3d is the place to be.
3274360	3278760	So um, if you, but, but, but wait, what did you see the box art?
3278760	3282840	No, I didn't.
3282840	3291840	Can you try to describe the box art cause it is a radio show, the box art is of a little
3291840	3299160	kitten, um, staring up at something that looks really fucking trippy and it's, it's awesome.
3299160	3304360	And of course their little, uh, description, it says, uh, navigate a kitten by jet pack
3304360	3309360	fueled by hopes and dreams through a fantastical world of techno, techno music feature.
3309360	3311160	I want him on our show.
3311160	3312160	Who made this game?
3312160	3318880	I want him on the show next week or her featuring DJ Hicksie, sea of love, uh, Frisco all around
3318880	3319880	the world.
3319880	3320880	Production's limited.
3320880	3322240	Who made this game?
3322240	3323240	Bring them to me.
3323240	3333200	Ol army, find me this person and bring them to mono X mono X is laughing over there.
3333200	3334200	She's dying.
3334200	3335200	You're right.
3335200	3336200	That's awesome.
3336200	3337280	That's awesome.
3337280	3343400	I'm going to submit this image of the box art to our, uh, image field there.
3343400	3348480	So fueled by hopes and dreams.
3348480	3349480	Blue swim.
3349480	3352640	If this is a friend of yours, I want them on the show now.
3352640	3353640	Bring them to me.
3353640	3354640	All right.
3354640	3359560	Let me bathe him and bring him.
3359560	3361560	He is being summoned to our castle.
3361560	3362560	All right.
3362560	3363560	Uh, anyhow.
3363560	3364560	Yeah.
3364560	3365560	Sony, 3d, whatever.
3365560	3366560	Who cares anymore?
3366560	3369400	Anyway, if you're like, Oh gee, I don't want to play the techno kitten game.
3369400	3373000	I want to play 3d games on my 3d TV cause I'm rich bitch.
3373000	3374400	And I got 3d televisions.
3374400	3376000	Well, good news for you.
3376000	3382680	Sony is, uh, taking a lot of the games on the PlayStation three and making them 3d 20
3382680	3386720	games internally at Sony alone are going to be converted for the 3d TV.
3386720	3391080	A quote here from Mick Hawking with Sony computer entertainment, Europe.
3391080	3395600	Overall we have more than 50 titles currently being converted into 3d and this number is
3395600	3396800	growing fast.
3396800	3398360	Some of them are massive names.
3398360	3401640	That's a really, really good sign that the industry is behind our unique message that
3401640	3405200	3d is a key element in the future of home consoles.
3405200	3409480	Is it just me or do I kind of read that as, well, you know, the 3ds everybody's got a
3409480	3410480	boner about.
3410480	3411960	So 3d must be the future.
3411960	3412960	Is that kind of, I don't know.
3412960	3413960	Maybe that's just what I read.
3413960	3416320	And this would be Sony saying this, uh, yeah.
3416320	3418280	Mick Hawking was Sony computer entertainment Europe.
3418280	3423280	That's odd that they would think that 3d is the future of air attainment because Sony
3423280	3427120	makes 3d TVs.
3427120	3428120	That's so crazy.
3428120	3433000	And that they would have 3d Blu-rays that they'd be pushing for their console.
3433000	3437000	And uh, yeah, biased much.
3437000	3441880	By the way, over 53d games in development overall, 20 of them are just the internals
3441880	3442960	there at Sony.
3442960	3446000	So a 3d is the wave of the future.
3446000	3447000	Everybody.
3447000	3448000	There you go.
3448000	3452400	I have officially purchased Techno, I need to make a tweet about that, but I've been
3452400	3453400	reading the news.
3453400	3457640	So I need DarkSakura to do a news story so I can go to the Twitters.
3457640	3463040	Well how about something about piece of shit 14, I mean Final Fantasy 14.
3463040	3466920	It looks like they're actually going to be doing an update to it.
3466920	3474840	It's going to be fixing the skill point allocation, UI response time, more accessible user interface.
3474840	3477120	There's actually a lot of stuff up on their official website.
3477120	3480720	But basically everyone said, it's crap!
3480720	3488280	So the Square Enix VP of software development, Hiromichi Tanaka said, the development team
3488280	3492480	is working really hard to bring it back to the level we plan to have ready for the players.
3492480	3496520	Yeah, in fact there's a whole bunch of updates ready for it.
3496520	3504260	According to the site, and I'm trying to pull all the information up, more tutorials, more
3504260	3509640	stuff to some of the scenarios, yes no confirmation prompt when you're selecting a path companion,
3509640	3515440	difficulties have been adjusted, lots of stuff.
3515440	3518920	So let me know if it's less crappy people.
3518920	3520840	Did they patch in fun?
3520840	3522840	Is fun in one of the bullet points?
3522840	3525400	There's one that says collecting seashells.
3525400	3527840	That sounds kind of stupid.
3527840	3530440	Maximum HP has been increased.
3530440	3531440	What about kittens with jetpacks?
3531440	3534200	Do we have any of those yet?
3534200	3536200	Let me see kittens, kittens, kittens, kittens.
3536200	3541880	Game idea man, you won't believe this, kittens, jetpacks.
3541880	3545560	Nothing about kittens.
3545560	3547560	Nothing about kittens, Rob.
3547560	3548560	Fail!
3548560	3549560	Fail.
3549560	3554040	Well, actually though, Final Fantasy does have the Mithra, or whatever they're calling
3554040	3558080	them now in Final Fantasy XIV, maybe they changed the name to Mazithra, I don't know.
3558080	3560320	But the kitten people, the cat people.
3560320	3562840	Isn't Mazithra like a pasta or something like that?
3562840	3563840	It's kind of cheese.
3563840	3565040	It's my favorite dish.
3565040	3567040	My favorite dish at the Old Spaghetti Factory.
3567040	3574360	That's right, cheese sauce, oh my god, you were talking about that before the show.
3574360	3580480	Favorite dish.
3580480	3583320	I hope your boyfriend isn't listening because you might get that line when you get home.
3583320	3588800	Hey, it's time for Mazithra con gusto.
3588800	3589800	That's right.
3589800	3592560	And he's long hair Chris, so he might have.
3592560	3595400	Sorry boys, she's taken.
3595400	3602760	Anyhow, let's move on, talk about some release dates of other games that are coming out around
3602760	3606080	the world and will start off in the US, although things are starting to slow down a little
3606080	3607080	bit, right?
3607080	3608080	That would be correct.
3608080	3612760	Not a lot this week, and thankfully not a lot of crappy games I can talk about.
3612760	3619240	But there's a few, so we'll talk about Chevrolet Camaro Wild Ride, which I'm sure is awesome,
3619240	3621320	that's coming out on the Wii.
3621320	3626600	Deadliest Catch, Sea of Chaos, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and
3626600	3632480	you better believe that the Xbox 360 will be supporting the Kinect and the PS3 The Move.
3632480	3639960	Sniper Elite on the Nintendo Wii, let's see here.
3639960	3644040	Game called Nailed, that's supposed to be a pretty awesome ATV off-road racing game
3644040	3647400	that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3647400	3659360	Epic Mickey on the Wii, game called Spell Force 2, Faith in Destiny, that's on PC, and
3659360	3667400	Golden Sun, Dark Dawn, coming out on DS this week, and that is it.
3667400	3671720	Oh, there's still some big titles in there, I thought Epic Mickey had already come out.
3671720	3674480	No, it's coming out this week.
3674480	3678880	And it looks like Hello Kitty Seasons was delayed another week, that is now coming out
3678880	3679880	this week.
3679880	3680880	Yippie skippy.
3680880	3682960	Alright, let's go over to Japan.
3682960	3688680	I'm sorry, real quick, this isn't a game, but the wireless Pro Guitar for the Wii is
3688680	3690320	coming out this week.
3690320	3693880	Alright, moving on to Japan and the Japanese release dates.
3693880	3697600	Things are slowing down a tad over there as well, but there are still some games.
3697600	3701400	Battlefield Bad Company 2 gets the Ultimate Edition, that's the Japanese version, not
3701400	3705080	an import, that comes out in Japan this week.
3705080	3711880	December the 2nd, also going on to the PlayStation 3, there's a few games on there.
3711880	3713520	There's Battlefield Bad Company there.
3713520	3716660	Dante's Inferno gets a price reduction, so does Killzone 2.
3716660	3722020	Hokuto Musou International comes out this week, as well as Fusa Sarita Shibuya Dei,
3722020	3723480	that's a price reduction as well.
3723480	3729220	A new game called Tales of Graces F, that's from Namco Bandai, comes out this week.
3729220	3732600	I'm assuming that is in the Tales of Graces series.
3732600	3738220	Oh, it was a Wii game originally, and they're saying it's not just a port, it actually expands
3738220	3743240	the world and adds a whole new epilogue to the game, so neat.
3743240	3749440	On other platforms, this week in Japan, looking at the Nintendo Wii, trying to see if there's
3749440	3750440	anything.
3750440	3753440	Just Taiko No Tatsujin, some of our music game fans like that game.
3753440	3755480	Mina Da Party comes out this week.
3755480	3762040	Naruto Shippuden, Gekkoto Ninja Taisen Special comes out this week, and Babysitter Mama is
3762040	3764600	a big release this week in Japan.
3764600	3770240	I saw the babies for that at Kmart.
3770240	3772440	They do kind of look like Cooking Mama had a baby.
3772440	3773440	Yeah, they do.
3773440	3776680	I always thought Cooking Mama's uterus had dried up, like I thought she was older than
3776680	3778960	that, but apparently not.
3778960	3781560	It does come with a baby that you can actually hold.
3781560	3785520	I wonder if they'll start using those for the home ec class, where you're supposed to
3785520	3786800	take care of a baby and stuff.
3786800	3791160	My little sister did that, and she was the type of girl that laid out all her outfits
3791160	3795200	for a week and looked all perfect, and by the end of the week with that crying electronic
3795200	3798760	baby, her hair looked like shit, and she was wearing sweatpants every day.
3798760	3799760	It was beautiful.
3799760	3803720	I'm sorry, but in this screenshot in the game, is she throwing a baby?
3803720	3805600	Like what's happening in this picture?
3805600	3808640	There's some type of like, throw the wiimote this way.
3808640	3813540	It's like baby tossing into a hot frying pan or something.
3813540	3814960	Is she cooking the baby?
3814960	3819760	It's a liver, a nice candy.
3819760	3821100	I'm going to put that in our chat room.
3821100	3822100	You come up with your own opinions.
3822100	3824960	I'm sorry, it looks like she's throwing the baby into a pot.
3824960	3828360	You know how to throw the baby.
3828360	3831280	What are they teaching the kids over there in Japan?
3831280	3837080	Alright, in all seriousness, some other games on the Sony PSP this week, Kamen Rider Climax
3837080	3846520	Heroes OOO, ooh, that's really the name of the game, Kamen Rider Climax Heroes, ooh,
3846520	3853480	Climax Heroes, ooh, Riders from Cougar to Oz, Cougar, breaks through the boundaries
3853480	3858560	that separates their series in this game, it's a fighting game, and it's powered up
3858560	3862880	the men with more skills.
3862880	3868720	LocoRoco2 gets a price reduction on the PSP, that's it, I'm spent, that's it for releases
3868720	3869960	this week in Japan.
3869960	3871840	How about UK?
3871840	3878120	We have a few things, on the 30th, Super Meat Boy for PC, and then on December 1st we have
3878120	3885600	Dead Nation, on the 3rd we have Ace Combat 11, Skies of Incursion, BlazBlue Continuum
3885600	3891280	Shift, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition,
3891280	3894440	and the Sly Collection.
3894440	3895440	That's about it.
3895440	3896440	Few biggies.
3896440	3901320	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then we're gonna get to the classic game
3901320	3905120	of the week, but first, Loki.
3905120	3909760	By the way, um, I found a way to contact the guy.
3909760	3910760	Did you?
3910760	3911760	Yes.
3911760	3914040	Alright, we'll get to that later.
3914040	3915040	We'll talk offline.
3915040	3916040	Yes.
3916040	3926160	Okay, so, uh, fun stuff, um, this is kinda neat, uh, CD Projekt, that's spelled P-R-O-J-E-K-T,
3926160	3933800	like Jekt, as in Final Fantasy X, um, they're fighting Witcher 2 Piracy with a threat of
3933800	3935280	a fine.
3935280	3941400	That's right, there's not gonna be any DRM in the actual title, but if they find out
3941400	3946080	that you're pirating the game, they're going to hunt you down.
3946080	3952360	They say, it says, we are signing with legal firms and torrent sneaking companies to hunt
3952360	3956080	down gamers who download The Witcher 2 unlawfully.
3956080	3960880	Such offenders will be sent a letter demanding they pay a fine, the sum of which was left
3960880	3967000	unspecified, though it sounds they'll be more than the game's suggested retail price, and
3967000	3972240	uh, it says, we don't want to be harsh, um, but there's a chance that this might happen
3972240	3977920	to some people if they downloaded it legally, or in other words, um, I guess, don't make
3977920	3979120	them mad.
3979120	3981800	So is this like policing through fear?
3981800	3982800	Or what exactly is the deal?
3982800	3987240	It sounds like it, it's, honestly though, I don't think that they're gonna be able to
3987240	3994720	follow through with this, you know what I mean, cause that, uh, I don't know.
3994720	3999840	It seems like an awful lot, I mean, and considering that as soon as this gets pirated, it's gonna
3999840	4004560	be all over the place, it's gonna be a little hard to track down every single person that's
4004560	4009080	downloaded it, so, I say it's more of an empty threat if you ask me.
4009080	4010080	They may try, but.
4010080	4014740	Or they'll make an example of one, like they did that one chick that was in Wisconsin or
4014740	4018960	whatever, that, you know, some mom that they took to court over some crappy songs that
4018960	4022500	she downloaded and they want to put her through the ringer for like two million dollars or
4022500	4024840	whatever it is, you know, crazy.
4024840	4030520	Well, just, here's what you do, you just don't download it on a torrent site, because they
4030520	4038560	get you for sharing, and so therefore, you know, you're, you know, I guess, pirating
4038560	4042080	stuff or you're sharing it with other people so they can claim a loss that's more than
4042080	4046080	the retail copy of the game, but if you download it like a direct download or something like
4046080	4052320	that, really they're only losing one copy, so, it'd be a harder argument for them.
4052320	4055400	And I don't think they can really track you that well.
4055400	4058040	And who really gives a crap about The Witcher 2 anyways?
4058040	4059580	That's my opinion.
4059580	4062880	Did a pic of Marissa's boobs go off on the internet or something, because I just noticed
4062880	4063880	the chat.
4063880	4068400	I thought that she sent me the picture for the sake of showing the listeners.
4068400	4071900	But it was for your private collection.
4071900	4075500	It is not the entire boobs, they're- I thought it would be a good promo for the
4075500	4076500	afterbirth.
4076500	4077500	New album art.
4077500	4080680	Hang out for the boobs.
4080680	4084200	Drama says, god damn, those are some tig ol' biddies.
4084200	4090680	They actually look bigger, because of the way I'm posing that photo.
4090680	4092000	Just let them believe whatever they want.
4092000	4093000	Let them believe whatever they want.
4093000	4094000	Don't get rid of their help!
4094000	4099800	It does suck when you wake up in the morning and you hit yourself in the face, but...
4099800	4100800	You know what, though?
4100800	4104880	You know, despite all the fun we're having, sometimes the tig ol' biddies can kind of
4104880	4105880	be a pain in the ass.
4105880	4108000	Like, it's not all fun and games.
4108000	4109000	Pain in the ass?
4109000	4110000	More like a pain in the back.
4110000	4111000	Exactly.
4111000	4112000	Alright.
4112000	4113000	Anyhow.
4113000	4118080	Do we mention she's a musician as well and you should buy her music if you're gonna,
4118080	4120760	like, be all like, uh, boobies?
4120760	4121760	Alright, anyhow.
4121760	4125880	No, I actually, this is kind of a serious story, and this kind of shit just makes me
4125880	4126880	so angry.
4126880	4132440	I want to talk about this for a minute, because this is serious, so less titties, more serious.
4132440	4137560	This is about something going on in Call of Duty's black ops, and I guess, and again,
4137560	4141160	these are not usually the type of games I play, but I guess there is a mode where you
4141160	4146520	can design your own logos and these logos will kind of go on the, like, you know, on
4146520	4149400	the uniforms of the people that you are controlling.
4149400	4155040	Well, of course, give a guy a pen and paper and eventually some asshole on the internet
4155040	4160380	is going to take a swastika and put that on their character to make their soldiers look
4160380	4161380	like Nazis.
4161380	4164480	Because apparently, to somebody, that's hilarious.
4164480	4170600	Well, uh, Steven Toulouse, who is, uh, one of the heads of Xbox Live, doesn't find it
4170600	4176240	funny at all and says, quote, it's not political correctness, it's fundamental respect.
4176240	4180320	If you think the swastika symbol should be reevaluated by societies all over the earth,
4180320	4181520	I think that's great.
4181520	4185860	Your Xbox Live profile or in-game logo, which doesn't have the context to explain your goal,
4185860	4187560	is not the right place to do that.
4187560	4191160	And by the way, that doesn't just go for the swastika, it applies to many other symbols
4191160	4195040	as well that my team does indeed take action on when we see it.
4195040	4199080	So in other words, the point of the story, if you are going to be one of these jackasses
4199080	4204080	who puts a swastika on your outfit and goes in order, or whatever it is, if it's, uh,
4204080	4209880	you know, uh, I hate homos or 9-11 was a lie or I don't know, whatever that stuff is you're
4209880	4213400	going to put on there, then, uh, they're, they're going to ban you if it's just like
4213400	4217060	overtly offensive, such as this symbol is.
4217060	4221040	And I totally agree with the guy, like, and there's going to be those people that are
4221040	4226280	like, whoa, we're supposed to have the right to free speeches.
4226280	4228520	You are on a private network.
4228520	4233860	And part of the terms of service is don't be a douchebag and I'm sorry, but if you're
4233860	4239720	putting this logo, you're only doing it to provoke a reaction of some sort.
4239720	4241400	You're just trying to be a douchebag.
4241400	4244760	There's really no nice way to say it.
4244760	4248080	You're just trying to cause a little controversy and be a douchebag.
4248080	4249920	Can't you just play the fucking game?
4249920	4254040	Like seriously, like why do people have to just be dicks?
4254040	4256720	You know, draw a penis.
4256720	4258500	Penises aren't offensive.
4258500	4261160	Draw a cunt if that makes you feel better.
4261160	4263360	Draw Marissa's boobies if you want those.
4263360	4265320	That's, that's a, that's not offensive at all.
4265320	4266320	That'd take up a lot.
4266320	4272560	I can't believe though in Call of Duty already, they've managed to, uh, uh, black ops, everything
4272560	4278220	is a, everything is a dick or my boyfriend's icon is humping bunnies and yeah, it's just
4278220	4282840	ever since, you know, uh, you know, prehistoric times, you see ancient cave paintings of penises
4282840	4284440	that just continues to this day.
4284440	4285720	There you go.
4285720	4290960	So you know what, especially in a war game, it's just unappropriate.
4290960	4291960	Thank you very much.
4291960	4292960	He-man stuff.
4292960	4301760	I, again, Act Deaf in our chat room says, don't be a douchebag should really be there
4301760	4304120	textual in the terms of service.
4304120	4307080	So you know, you know what I say?
4307080	4313240	Since I'm not offended by the symbol itself, it's been used in many cultures.
4313240	4315880	It's a good luck charm in many of them.
4315880	4322840	It's on American, um, uh, architecture from before, you know, 1942.
4322840	4327960	But when you have it up there in black on a white background with red around it, that's
4327960	4330680	saying something and that's offensive.
4330680	4332600	Especially in the context of a war game.
4332600	4333600	Exactly.
4333600	4338240	It's like, you know what you're doing, you know, these, these guys, and I'm sure there's
4338240	4342720	these guys, what about my freedom of speech and you know, what are, you know, it's just
4342720	4343720	a symbol.
4343720	4345720	You can go on the street and yell whatever you want.
4345720	4346720	Yeah.
4346720	4349200	You agree to the terms you play by them.
4349200	4350200	Exactly.
4350200	4355240	You know what, if you want to display whatever you want to, then you can do it without, you
4355240	4357440	know, their service.
4357440	4359220	You don't have to pay for it.
4359220	4363980	You know, here's the thing, if you are the type of person that just feels this need to
4363980	4369240	provoke people with the symbol, why don't you stop hiding behind your X-Box and why
4369240	4374400	don't you go out onto the street and yell, I love Hitler and see what happens to you.
4374400	4375400	Yeah.
4375400	4379200	Because that's what you're trying to do with that type of symbol basically, but you're,
4379200	4382440	you're being a coward and hiding behind your monitor.
4382440	4386540	If you feel so strongly about the statement you're trying to make, why don't you go yell
4386540	4388640	it in a crowded theater and see what happens to you?
4388640	4393300	I just think it's really awful that a failed art student, you know, had to ruin it for
4393300	4395000	everybody.
4395000	4397920	I just think it's ironic that people that are usually the example, supposed to be the
4397920	4401920	example of white supremacy aren't really good examples and people you never want to fuck
4401920	4402920	anyway, so.
4402920	4403920	Yeah.
4403920	4407840	It's just the most, I wasn't thinking that Greg Probst spit, the white race is a superior
4407840	4408840	race.
4408840	4409840	Yeah.
4409840	4414120	It's, it's like most homophobes I meet are usually like, well, I don't like gay guys
4414120	4418120	cause you know, they all want to put it in my butt and it's like, don't flatter.
4418120	4419120	No.
4419120	4420120	Flatter yourself.
4420120	4421120	Exactly.
4421120	4425200	I, you're like not even on the list.
4425200	4426560	You're not in the top 20.
4426560	4427560	You know what?
4427560	4429920	You're not even in the top 9 million actually.
4429920	4436280	You're, you're, in fact you, there is no list that you're on whatsoever, so just don't flatter
4436280	4437280	yourself.
4437280	4438280	Exactly.
4438280	4443640	And you know what, and, and honestly, if, if some, you know, if a guy did happen to
4443640	4448320	hit on you, I have to say, not interested.
4448320	4452120	Well usually that, that'll, saying, well I'm not interested.
4452120	4455840	If you, you know, you know what it is, you know what I think all of, all of hate comes
4455840	4456960	back to?
4456960	4457960	Insecurity.
4457960	4459560	Don't you think?
4459560	4460560	Absolutely.
4460560	4465480	And so these people who think, oh well I'm gonna be, I'm gonna bring attention to myself
4465480	4470720	by, you know, by using something that I know is gonna offend people and I'm gonna do all
4470720	4474000	the shock value, all it's doing is just making you look like a douche.
4474000	4475000	Give me attention!
4475000	4480600	Well this is, this is the, what I, what I would like, and I'm sorry for getting a little
4480600	4481600	ranty on this.
4481600	4482800	No, it's okay.
4482800	4487500	I think that, and you know, I have the same opinion towards cussing by the way.
4487500	4490160	We needed some good controversy tonight, so.
4490160	4496520	I think that by bringing, the, the more people make a big deal out of something, you know
4496520	4497520	what I mean?
4497520	4502840	I mean, about certain things, the more power they're actually giving to it as opposed to
4502840	4506800	what should be happening, and that's taking power out of it.
4506800	4510120	That's taking the fear out of an object, you know what I mean?
4510120	4516200	Taking, and I, and I understand that you don't want to ever forget what happened, what brought
4516200	4521320	these about, but at the same time, you know, you don't want to keep giving people the power
4521320	4526260	to hurt you with whatever means they want to.
4526260	4533040	And I think, I, I think it's very good that they're going to, to ban the use on Xbox Live.
4533040	4534540	That's good.
4534540	4540040	But I do at the same time think that that's just also giving a little bit more fuel to,
4540040	4543920	and you know, I'm trying to see how to phrase this right, because I, I believe they were
4543920	4544920	right.
4544920	4545920	I'm 100% behind that.
4545920	4547000	I think that's good.
4547000	4548000	Thank you for taking the stand.
4548000	4549820	I think that's really good.
4549820	4555020	But at the same time, I think that that's just lighting a little bit more fire to their
4555020	4559520	butts and starting more controversy by going out and making a big statement about it.
4559520	4563700	I just think the band should have been quiet.
4563700	4565040	You know, does that make sense?
4565040	4566040	No, it does.
4566040	4569960	Ban, ban it, but don't go out and do a press statement saying, oh, we're banning it.
4569960	4571600	You, here's your cookie.
4571600	4572600	Haters gonna hate, man.
4572600	4573600	Haters gonna hate.
4573600	4574600	That's it.
4574600	4575600	Haters gonna hate.
4575600	4576600	Haters gonna hate.
4576600	4581360	So why make a, why make a big deal, why make a big deal out of the haters when you can
4581360	4586400	just, you know, if they protest it, send them an email, you've been banned for this, this
4586400	4587400	and this.
4587400	4588400	I will say this.
4588400	4594640	It wasn't quite a press release, just so you know, the guy who is with Xbox runs a personal
4594640	4600520	blog and he addressed this issue in his personal blog, which the game blogs picked up because
4600520	4602440	he happens to have that position.
4602440	4605000	So just, just to be fair, it is not a press release.
4605000	4609780	It was his personal blog where I think that's actually kind of neat that he touches on these
4609780	4615080	touchy subjects in his personal blog where maybe he can't say it in a press release.
4615080	4616080	That I'm better with.
4616080	4617080	That I'm better with.
4617080	4618080	Yeah.
4618080	4621040	I mean, but if it had been out like a press release, that's just, you know, it's sort
4621040	4626080	of like, you know, when a little kid, you tell them they can't do something and they
4626080	4630800	want to do it even more because you tell them that they can't do it.
4630800	4636400	Here's a direct quote from the dude's blog and I love this because it's the TLDR, Too
4636400	4638400	Long Didn't Read, at the end.
4638400	4642580	If you see offensive symbols in Call of Duty Black Ops, report them using the in-game option
4642580	4644380	and they will be taken care of.
4644380	4648240	If you want to argue that swastikas are actually awesome, go to another forum.
4648240	4649760	On Xbox Live, they are not allowed.
4649760	4650760	Happy face.
4650760	4652760	See, that, that's fine.
4652760	4658800	It's, I mean, and, and thanks for clarifying that for me, but it's just, but, but I want
4658800	4662800	to know, I'm not sure that I'm making the right kind of sense when I'm trying to say
4662800	4663800	this.
4663800	4668600	Because there's a fine line between doing the right thing, which is, you know, obviously
4668600	4672640	he's doing this right thing and bringing undue attention to it.
4672640	4674280	I agree with that.
4674280	4675280	I agree.
4675280	4678560	Because it's just making them think it's all the better to do.
4678560	4680000	Oh, it's pushing buttons.
4680000	4681960	Let's do it some more.
4681960	4683720	I could get into this whole other topic.
4683720	4688160	You know, obviously, you know, you, you have a lot of passion on a lot of these types of
4688160	4691120	issues because your recent conversion to Judaism.
4691120	4694360	I have a lot of passion on the homophobia issues and I could get into this whole thing
4694360	4698880	about the whole, like, I don't agree with trying to like drag people out of the closet,
4698880	4702880	but that's for another episode when that's the topic.
4702880	4707840	But there's, you know, there's always different perspectives.
4707840	4712360	I just think people just need to get over themselves.
4712360	4714280	Let's play happy music and do a happy segment.
4714280	4715280	Shall we?
4715280	4716280	Let's change the mood.
4716280	4717280	Let's, let's play happy music.
4717280	4721840	It's not as good as the techno king song, but it'll deal.
4721840	4722840	All right.
4722840	4724200	This is, uh, the classic game of the week.
4724200	4729360	This is a segment where we like to take a look back on games of the past and dark soccer
4729360	4734080	is going to find a classic game that she thinks all you kids ought to be playing right now.
4734080	4735900	The classic game of the week.
4735900	4736900	Dark soccer.
4736900	4737900	What is the classic game of the week?
4737900	4740240	The classic game of the week is smash TV.
4740240	4741240	Yes.
4741240	4744640	We're going to blow shit up this classic game of the week.
4744640	4745640	Awesome.
4745640	4746640	Skip up a little bit.
4746640	4752520	Smash TV was made in 1990.
4752520	4754200	It was William's game.
4754200	4755880	Mark Tramiel was one of the people behind it.
4755880	4760000	He of course gives Mortal Kombat any big surprise there.
4760000	4762640	It was published by Acclaim for the home systems.
4762640	4767680	And basically it is based off of the other creator was Eugene Jarvis is based off of
4767680	4775500	his game robotron 2084, so it's got a dual joystick control and it's sort of taking elements
4775500	4780680	from the running man, um, you know, where basically you're on a violent video game show
4780680	4781680	or video game.
4781680	4783040	You're on a violent game show.
4783040	4789920	It said in 1999, Ooh, and basically you have to run around and, uh, shoot people who are
4789920	4795080	trying to kill you and you get power ups and weapons and bonus prizes.
4795080	4799560	And uh, it has a game show host who has the best lines ever.
4799560	4802000	I'd buy that for a dollar.
4802000	4804960	Big money, big prizes.
4804960	4807080	I love it.
4807080	4808080	Exactly.
4808080	4815800	And, uh, actually, uh, the I'd buy that for a dollar, um, was, uh, from, uh, a comic in
4815800	4816800	Robocop.
4816800	4817800	Wow.
4817800	4818800	Nice.
4818800	4827120	Um, you have, uh, in fact, one of the enemies is called Mr. Shrapnel who, uh, comes from
4827120	4829960	the sides of the walls and, uh, then he explodes.
4829960	4832960	Um, however, in the NES version, he's a giant rolling bomb.
4832960	4836800	Um, it's very, very difficult and very, very violent.
4836800	4842120	Um, it's come out on the NES, the SNES as Super Smash TV on the Game Gear, the Genesis
4842120	4846560	slash Master System slash Mega Drive as Super Smash TV.
4846560	4852400	Um, you actually can use on the NES, you can use the directional pad on the second controller
4852400	4854880	to, uh, control where you're shooting.
4854880	4858120	Um, you have to use the multi-tap though to get that done.
4858120	4862200	It also came out, um, it was produced by Ocean for the ZX Spectrum.
4862200	4870640	Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, uh, Atari ST, and Commodore Amiga in 1992, and, uh, I actually
4870640	4873640	had no idea it was on the Commodore 64, I thought I had every game.
4873640	4875040	Oh, Rob failed.
4875040	4876040	I know.
4876040	4881120	Um, it came out in 1999 as part of the Arcade Party Pack that came out on PlayStation, which
4881120	4885160	is, I do believe, where the clip that I sent you came from.
4885160	4891760	Um, it was on Midway Arcade Treasures, which is on PC, GameCube, Xbox, PS2, and they will
4891760	4894320	save your high scores, ooh.
4894320	4900960	You can get it on Xbox Live Arcade, um, for the Xbox 360, it's 400 Microsoft points, um,
4900960	4904840	but, um, I think that they've actually taken the purchase off.
4904840	4910360	Um, but yeah, they had, and, um, the creators had said that they were considering a Smash
4910360	4913360	TV 2, so that's pretty interesting.
4913360	4920000	But in any way, you know, the game's fun, Dan was actually a, I mentioned it on the
4920000	4925280	show before, but his buddy Eric was over here, and Eric had never played Smash TV, so Dan's
4925280	4927280	like, edumacation!
4927280	4932960	DJ Dark Knight in our chatroom asks, wasn't the host the final boss?
4932960	4935960	I never got that far.
4935960	4936960	Like I said-
4936960	4942400	I remember, your husband has, like, the achievements on Xbox Live for, like, the really uber stuff
4942400	4944680	that's like, oh my god, how does he do it?
4944680	4945680	Yeah.
4945680	4946680	It's a hard game.
4946680	4950840	Dan's really good at, and he used to play it all the time, from what I remember him
4950840	4951840	saying.
4951840	4954000	And you, can I say something else, just speaking of Dan?
4954000	4955000	Sure.
4955000	4961600	Tomorrow is his birthday, he's gonna be years old, and-
4961600	4964000	21, that's good to know.
4964000	4965000	35.
4965000	4966000	Okay.
4966000	4971840	And I love my sweetie, so I dedicate this classic game of the week to my boy, to my
4971840	4972840	Dan Chon.
4972840	4973840	I'm just kidding.
4973840	4974840	Shut up!
4974840	4976840	No, that's cute.
4976840	4978840	And he's not even here to hear it, the jerk!
4978840	4980560	You'll have to play it back for him.
4980560	4981560	Hearts.
4981560	4982960	There you go.
4982960	4983960	Happy birthday, Dan.
4983960	4984960	Happy birthday, Dan!
4984960	4985960	Hippo birdies.
4985960	4986960	Hippo birdies?
4986960	4988960	Hippo birdies to use.
4988960	4990960	Oh, okay.
4990960	4998080	Alright, that's gonna do it for this part A of Orange Laundry, but we're not done yet.
4998080	5001480	Come on back for part B, there's plenty more to come tonight, including the rest of your
5001480	5003720	Twitter topics, of which there's quite a few tonight.
5003720	5009400	A lot of rapid news tonight, some mailbag stuff, get in your emails if you haven't got
5009400	5014960	them in yet, some news about new Castlevania download content, maybe a game if I have time
5014960	5015960	to write questions.
5015960	5016960	Maybe.
5016960	5018800	We're running a little bit long tonight, though, so we'll see.
5018800	5022320	I kind of want to take a lot of calls if we can, so we might push the game around.
5022320	5024320	We'll see.
5024320	5028720	We will be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so don't go anywhere,
5028720	5035480	we'll be right back.
5035480	5039920	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has
5039920	5040920	a voice.
5040920	5044800	We are taping live on this Sunday evening as we do every week at AllGames.com, 6 o'clock
5044800	5046560	Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
5046560	5052120	It is episode number 391 of our show for November the 28th of 2010.
5052120	5060160	We are joined here tonight with our special guest Marissa, Marissa Congusto with the boosto.
5060160	5064340	But we do love her and she likes her old school adventure games, you know, she might not be
5064340	5067840	much of a hardcore gamer, but she definitely has an appreciation for what King's Quest
5067840	5068840	you were saying.
5068840	5070640	What's your favorite King's Quest game?
5070640	5071640	You know what?
5071640	5072640	Say four, say four, say four.
5072640	5075640	Because that was my favorite.
5075640	5078640	I'm losing track of the numbers even though I just played them the other day.
5078640	5080760	The one with the really annoying owl.
5080760	5085680	I know that sounds like I don't know the game, but I adored that game and you know, ooh,
5085680	5086680	Graham.
5086680	5088680	That sounds like five.
5088680	5089680	I think that's five.
5089680	5092280	And that's sad that I know that, but I think that might be five.
5092280	5097080	Yes, sorry I'm having a blonde moment mixing up my numbers, but Space Quest I also loved
5097080	5098840	and of course Sam and Max.
5098840	5099840	There you go, there you go.
5099840	5106040	I'm doing a search for King's Quest annoying owl and it was King's Quest V.
5106040	5107040	Oh, yes.
5107040	5109840	Have you previously played King's Quest V?
5109840	5110840	No.
5110840	5112720	It's a very goddamn game.
5112720	5115240	So you were just a Sierra fangirl basically.
5115240	5116240	I really was.
5116240	5119060	I loved Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.
5119060	5120060	And LucasArts.
5120060	5121060	There's always room for both.
5121060	5124560	And his desktop adventures, what the fuck.
5124560	5125560	Nice.
5125560	5129160	All right, hey, and the chat room was backing me up there that King's Quest V, it was definitely
5129160	5130160	five.
5130160	5132120	DDR dollar bill and Salacious Pop backing me up there.
5132120	5133120	So.
5133120	5134120	The annoying owl.
5134120	5135240	Oh, that's right.
5135240	5136240	Five was on the NES.
5136240	5138600	I forgot there was an NES version of that.
5138600	5140360	You're looking at a screenshot from the NES version.
5140360	5141360	Yeah.
5141360	5142360	I'm going to post it in the chat room.
5142360	5143360	Crazy, crazy.
5143360	5144360	All right.
5144360	5147760	Anyhow, we are going to get into some rapid fire news, but first, this is usually the
5147760	5149600	part where we plug the spinoff shows.
5149600	5152960	If you like Orange Island Radio, do check out some of our spinoff shows and the other
5152960	5153960	content we work on.
5153960	5157000	I have a whole podcast about World of Warcraft.
5157000	5161360	I didn't even talk about it tonight, but it was a huge week in World of Warcraft.
5161360	5162720	We had a jumbo podcast this week.
5162720	5164400	It's called Horde House.
5164400	5165400	That's how you found it on Twitter.
5165400	5166400	Sorry.
5166400	5167960	Well, yeah, it's on Twitter, but also iTunes.
5167960	5171400	H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E, the best little Horde House in Azeroth.
5171400	5174080	Myself and Extra are talking about Warcraft.
5174080	5177200	And Dark Saga has a comic book podcast that she hosts with some friends.
5177200	5178200	A qua-qua?
5178200	5179200	A comic book podcast.
5179200	5180200	Cod-past.
5180200	5181200	A com-cast.
5181200	5185200	A comic-ast podcast pod.
5185200	5193240	It's called Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y, and we record on Sunday in the mornings, and
5193240	5195360	we go up on Tuesday.
5195360	5202600	And we're an excellent little podcast involving me and Mara and Marvel, or Tiara, and Dan
5202600	5205440	Shadow, and we talk about comics.
5205440	5208640	Today was mostly talking about Star Trek.
5208640	5212400	One of these days we need to get, like, worlds to collide, and we need to get, like, Tiara,
5212400	5215360	Dan, and Extra for all on a show and just see what happens.
5215360	5216360	World of Warcraft.
5216360	5217360	It'll be fun.
5217360	5220360	Oh yeah, we'll just revert to World of Warcraft talk, because they play WoW, huh?
5220360	5225320	Yeah, meanwhile, I'm the one with Taste that plays Star Trek online.
5225320	5226800	We need to get them on courthouse.
5226800	5229360	I did make Vice Admiral, by the way.
5229360	5230360	Congratulations, whatever that means.
5230360	5232160	I can't rank anymore!
5232160	5236760	I leveled a priest to 24 in, like, three days.
5236760	5237760	Good.
5237760	5241760	I'm now on my Klingon character, who's not actually Klingon.
5241760	5244680	Alright, let's get back into some rapid-fire news.
5244680	5248640	Loki's just like, I don't have a spin-off show, I have a baby.
5248640	5252260	I don't have time for a spin-off show, nor would I want to- I remember when I tried doing
5252260	5254600	spin-off shows, it took too much damn time.
5254600	5259200	Which was the most under-appreciated show we ever did when Orange Lounge Radio was a
5259200	5260200	station.
5260200	5262360	I actually thought your show, and you had what was called LimeWire?
5262360	5263360	LiveWire?
5263360	5264360	What was it called?
5264360	5265360	LiveWire.
5265360	5266360	LiveWire was your mix show.
5266360	5267360	You actually took-
5267360	5268360	LimeWire was that downloading thing.
5268360	5269360	Oh yeah, that's right.
5269360	5270360	Whatever.
5270360	5271360	I thought maybe- I don't know if it was a play on something.
5271360	5272360	So-
5272360	5273360	He was named after a soda.
5273360	5274360	Shut up.
5274360	5277160	You mixed video game music live on air.
5277160	5280320	You actually had turntables, and maybe, like, nine people listened, because it was on a
5280320	5281320	Friday night.
5281320	5282320	Eh, whatever.
5282320	5284080	It was so under-appreciated, but you did such an awesome job.
5284080	5287520	If there's still MP3s of that show floating around, people should try to find them.
5287520	5289120	This is a great show.
5289120	5291120	I have all of them.
5291120	5292120	Alright.
5292120	5294960	Uh, yeah, so, rapid fire news.
5294960	5299940	Um, the VGA is right around the corner, and of course with the video game awards shows
5299940	5306200	that are on, um, Spike, they of course show some new trailers for games that haven't been
5306200	5307280	announced yet.
5307280	5313360	And one of those trailers is being teased right now, and of course, no one knows exactly
5313360	5316320	what it is, but yeah, we know exactly what it is.
5316320	5319320	Um, apparently the game is going to be a new Resident Evil game.
5319320	5325240	The way we know that is because apparently, a while back, they made a Resident Evil t-shirt
5325240	5330760	with the exact same silhouettes of the zombies that are featured in the teaser.
5330760	5331760	Oopsie.
5331760	5334320	So yes, it's a new Resident Evil game.
5334320	5337680	Wow, that is recycled artwork, if I've ever seen it before.
5337680	5340680	I mean, it's hard to convey on the radio, but, uh, you know-
5340680	5341680	Yeah, it's like-
5341680	5344120	Loki's looking at a side-by-side comparison.
5344120	5346960	This is also the same zombie just flipped, I mean-
5346960	5351320	That or someone just flat out stole from someone else, which would also be hilarious if it
5351320	5353680	didn't end up being Resident Evil at this point.
5353680	5358680	But there's another, uh, another image or whatever that says, you know, stay alert,
5358680	5364000	stay alive, report symptoms, and it has a biohazard logo on it, so, you know, biohazard
5364000	5365000	Resident Evil.
5365000	5366000	Yeah.
5366000	5367000	It's not a stretch.
5367000	5368000	I mean, come on.
5368000	5370680	Sequel to successful game franchise?
5370680	5371680	Whoa.
5371680	5377120	Uh, so yeah, I expect a new Resident Evil game to be announced.
5377120	5379640	Um, it's kind of fun.
5379640	5383960	With the new firmware that came out for, or I should say the new dashboard for the Xbox
5383960	5392640	360, there was a new, they're calling it the AP 2.5 Protection that was supposed to flag
5392640	5398500	consoles as being banned, or flag them if you were playing a burnt game or whatever
5398500	5400280	on modified drives.
5400280	5407040	Well, apparently, not what, a couple weeks after the firmware or the new dashboard came
5407040	5409280	out, they have already found a way around it.
5409280	5412760	And they've actually come over forever.
5412760	5421520	The custom firmware group has released new firmwares for iXtreme, LT+, for line on and
5421520	5424920	BenQ drives for the Xbox 360.
5424920	5430720	It allows, um, it says defeats current AP 2.5 protection, protects consoles from logging
5430720	5435840	AP 2.5 violations, full disk stealth, and yada yada yada.
5435840	5442040	Basically it means that they've found a way past their new, uh, I don't know if it's supposed
5442040	5445280	to be undefeatable, but, um, new copy protection.
5445280	5448640	Didn't take very long, so, interesting.
5448640	5454160	Um, and then finally, and this is kind of neat, we were talking a little bit about,
5454160	5458280	I should say, Rob was talking about how he likes Super Meat Boy, and I was asking him
5458280	5463760	about, um, you know, the internets, uh, teh internets.
5463760	5470560	Apparently they get regular patches to that game that allow additional levels to be added.
5470560	5476720	And they've just gotten 20 new levels, and they're calling it the Sewers of Droz.
5476720	5482080	It's a free pack, features Gish as the only playable character.
5482080	5490240	And, um, it's, um, I guess, a little bit different than the normal, uh, Super Meat Boy stuff.
5490240	5496640	As well as they're also going to be, um, including, um, some new DLC chapters, made specifically
5496640	5500440	for, uh, Commander Video and The Kid.
5500440	5505680	Uh, those are coming early 2011, along with the Best of User Submitted level pack.
5505680	5509960	They'll feature, uh, 20 levels created by PC Mac players.
5509960	5516640	And also, uh, two non-specific, um, or non-character specific DLC packs will arrive via teh internets
5516640	5517640	in December.
5517640	5524280	Uh, Meat Boy, a retro chapter, uh, based on the Best of, uh, Meat Boy Flash prototype,
5524280	5529760	and iMeat Boy, a pack of, uh, remixed levels from the main game, um, made more difficult.
5529760	5533680	Yes, that's right, they're taking levels from the game and making them even more difficult
5533680	5534680	than they were.
5534680	5538040	Well, they, they already have the Dark World and the Light World, like, I don't know if
5538040	5539040	I talked about this enough.
5539040	5540040	It's difficult.
5540040	5541040	Darker World or what?
5541040	5545920	Like, yeah, every level in the game, if you get an A+, meaning you, uh, clear it under
5545920	5550880	the par time, then there's a Dark World version that's just even meaner.
5550880	5554400	Because some of those level, like, the Light World levels, like, some of them are really
5554400	5555400	hard.
5555400	5559000	Like, I almost cried.
5559000	5561360	Just ask Salacious Pop, he laughed the whole time.
5561360	5565720	Um, and Rob, I guess, uh, teh internets, I'm trying to see how you would access them.
5565720	5570680	It says, uh, there's a level called teh internets.
5570680	5577160	It's a world that will and, um, a world that can and will be automatically updated with
5577160	5580960	free level packs using the title manage storage system.
5580960	5583640	I probably just haven't dug around enough in the game.
5583640	5584640	There's a lot in there.
5584640	5589440	Yeah, but they have, like, this cool little, like, um, path or whatever that they have
5589440	5590640	a bunch of different levels.
5590640	5593800	Yeah, most of the, most of the worlds have that, but I don't, it looks like the background's
5593800	5594800	a little different.
5594800	5598640	Some of the warp zones and stuff, too, because some of the warp zone retro stuff is, is the
5598640	5599640	hilarious stuff.
5599640	5600640	Yeah.
5600640	5603200	Uh, Dark Toa Gak in our chatroom says, I'm sorry, but Super Meat Boy really sounds like
5603200	5604200	a porno.
5604200	5605200	Oh, that's what it is?
5605200	5606200	Why?
5606200	5611240	Um, like, it, it, like, it's the worst title and, like, some of the worst, like, cover
5611240	5613720	art I've ever seen, but the game is amazing.
5613720	5618320	You get teh internets, it's actually, you have to obtain 20 bandages.
5618320	5621000	Oh, I am really terrible, you guys.
5621000	5623080	I have, like, four bandages.
5623080	5625000	So I'll work on that.
5625000	5626000	That makes sense.
5626000	5627000	Alpha Kananagram is echoing that in the chatroom.
5627000	5628080	All right, I'll work on that.
5628080	5629400	I'll work on getting 20 bandages.
5629400	5631520	Guys, it is a really hard game, okay?
5631520	5633160	That's, that's all I'm saying.
5633160	5637280	All right, if that's all Loki's got, then I'll go to some more, uh, rapid fire news
5637280	5638280	here.
5638280	5639280	How about free download content?
5639280	5640580	Who likes free stuff?
5640580	5641720	You better hurry on this one, though.
5641720	5644260	It's only free until Tuesday, November 30th.
5644260	5648640	Free content for DJ Hero 2 and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.
5648640	5652040	So if you own either of these games, you might want to go grab this real quick.
5652040	5657480	Uh, there's a DJ Tiesto-themed three-track pack for DJ Hero 2.
5657480	5660760	And if you're a fan of My Chemical Romance, you can get some of their music on Warriors
5660760	5661760	of Rock.
5661760	5663240	Uh, now, here's the deal.
5663240	5666180	You have to get a redemption code for them.
5666180	5669200	You go to Coca-Cola's code-generating website.
5669200	5676260	It's at MyCoke.com, and it sounds illegal, uh, slash Guitar Hero, while supplies last.
5676260	5678520	But I can't imagine they're out yet.
5678520	5688040	And if you want just a taste of what the DJ Hero 2 DLC sounds like.
5688040	5689600	I think electronic music is ready to go.
5689600	5690600	I don't want to hear the guy talking.
5690600	5692280	I just wanted to hear some music.
5692280	5693280	So there you go.
5693280	5697240	And the, the DJ, uh, Hero one's a little bit harder to find.
5697240	5706440	I believe it's, um, MyCokeRewards.com slash Rewards slash DJ-Hero dash, um, I have Tiesto
5706440	5707440	spelled wrong.
5707440	5708440	Tisto.
5708440	5709440	DJ Tisto.
5709440	5710440	Tisto.
5710440	5714040	Um, dash mix dash pack.
5714040	5716960	Um, and that should pick it up.
5716960	5720360	Otherwise I know there, the, there was a story on the internet.
5720360	5721360	You'll find it.
5721360	5724400	There was a story on Joystick or whatever that had a link, someone made a link to it
5724400	5725840	because I could not find it.
5725840	5731360	I got the actual, you know, the newsletter or nothing new, the PR Newswire or whatever.
5731360	5734440	I'm like, okay, where, where the hell's the link to download this?
5734440	5737120	And I went on My Coke Rewards and there's nothing on there.
5737120	5738600	I'm like, well, fuck.
5738600	5743680	Uh, Tigerclaw wanted to know what songs for Tiesto, uh, Traffic mixed with Louder Than
5743680	5744680	Boom.
5744680	5747600	Uh, the Feel It In My Bones song he did with Tegan and Sarah, which I actually really liked
5747600	5748600	that song.
5748600	5749600	It's a cool song.
5749600	5752020	And Knock You Out featuring Emily Haynes mixed with Young Lions.
5752020	5753440	Those are the songs in there.
5753440	5758160	Uh, and for Dark Sakura, who I know likes My Chemical Romance, the free songs are Bulletproof
5758160	5761880	Heart, Helena, Teenagers, and Welcome to the Black Parade.
5761880	5765820	And they will become paid DLC once, uh, that expires.
5765820	5769560	So even if you don't own the game, just download the, get the code and then that way you have
5769560	5772160	it for when you do buy the game.
5772160	5776600	That actually, those are actually songs that I would really like, cause I mean, I've got,
5776600	5782040	um, the ones that they did for Rock Band and I wanted more like Helena is such a great
5782040	5783040	song.
5783040	5785000	It'd be really fun to have.
5785000	5790240	Now going onto another news story, this, I, I am so confused by this next story.
5790240	5791240	This is just so crazy.
5791240	5792240	All right.
5792240	5793420	Game Room, right?
5793420	5797120	It was kind of neat when it first came out and then like the games that have been released
5797120	5798840	for it had been kind of blue.
5798840	5802960	And then, you know, Chrome has been having problems and so we've all just kind of written
5802960	5803960	off Game Room.
5803960	5804960	Right?
5804960	5808040	Well, did you hear what games came out on Game Room this week?
5808040	5815160	If you missed it, uh, Game Pack 12 has the arcade version of Blades of Steel, Trick Trap
5815160	5821680	1771, Pitfall 2 on the Atari 2600, which by the way is my favorite 2600 game ever made.
5821680	5824480	Uh, and the Intellivision's Vectron.
5824480	5829520	Now some of the Game Room, uh, people that can, you can go in on the PC version and kind
5829520	5832400	of see like what games are going to be coming out soon.
5832400	5833400	Get this.
5833400	5834600	You know what else is in the pack?
5834600	5842880	Amidaar, Food Fight, Puyen, Sunset Riders from Konami and Dark Sakura, Twinbee is in
5842880	5845400	this pack, right?
5845400	5849820	So I'm sitting here going, you're putting this out now?
5849820	5852900	You waited until now to give us this stuff?
5852900	5856920	Like when everybody was declaring, ah, Game Rooms, oh, Game Rooms.
5856920	5860280	You waited until now to whip out Sunset Riders.
5860280	5861280	Twinbee!
5861280	5864320	And, yeah, Twinbee, whatever.
5864320	5865320	Twinbee!
5865320	5870160	Like, I don't even understand the idea behind that or what, that's, oh my gosh.
5870160	5876880	And Blades of Steel, like the best hockey game ever made, arcade version nonetheless,
5876880	5881440	which I bet a lot of people haven't even played because we all just remember the NES version.
5881440	5886200	Yeah, so if you haven't been on Game Room in a while, now you have reason to go check
5886200	5887200	it out again.
5887200	5891040	Like, seriously, surely one of those games made you go, oh, what, what, what?
5891040	5893800	And yeah, the pricing is still the same.
5893800	5897600	It's what, three dollars on one platform, five on both?
5897600	5899160	Crazy.
5899160	5903640	One more story for you guys about Dance Central download content and some of the stuff that's
5903640	5907640	available there, and I'm sure, ah, Loki's downloaded them all already and he's getting
5907640	5914440	into this, ah, Cameo with Word Up, Word Up, and then, ah, Tag Team with Whoop, there it
5914440	5915440	is.
5915440	5917440	I know Loki's dancing to that one.
5917440	5920800	Whoop, I hope he gets to raise the roof in that song.
5920800	5922720	You need to play Dance Central, Marissa.
5922720	5924280	How long are you in town, Marissa?
5924280	5926440	Ah, I have to leave on Tuesday morning.
5926440	5927440	Ah, shit.
5927440	5931400	If I didn't have this whole work thing tomorrow, I'd be like, I'm bringing Dance Central over,
5931400	5933400	we're playing Whoop, there it is.
5933400	5936120	Come down for Tron, you can crash on my floor.
5936120	5939800	Wish I could make it work, we'll see, we'll see.
5939800	5942320	You can sleep in the Chris's gamer chair.
5942320	5945320	And then, ah, Black Eyed Peas, the one that makes the creepy noises.
5945320	5950800	Yeah, it makes creepy noises at night when the temperature changes all of a sudden.
5950800	5952000	It's Haunted Chair.
5952000	5956320	If you actually like the Black Eyed Peas, I've Got a Feeling is coming out, which, what
5956320	5960360	David Guetta did kind of helped with that track, and he's cool, so I'll give it that.
5960360	5963400	There you go, that's your Dance Central DLC.
5963400	5964400	Dark Sakura?
5964400	5967880	Well, we have some other stuff.
5967880	5977080	For the consoles, there is, on Capcom's official Japanese language blog, there are screens
5977080	5980640	of Yun and Yang in their arranged costumes.
5980640	5985880	So instead of their little kind of streety looking fun outfits, they are dressed as a
5985880	5988280	chef and a waiter.
5988280	5992440	And yeah, chef and a waiter.
5992440	5993440	So that should be cool.
5993440	5998760	Apparently there's going to be achievements open for both of the characters as well.
5998760	6006080	And rumors of an evil Ryu, a grain of salt territory, and some other stuff.
6006080	6014720	Also for those waiting for Otomedias X-cellent, it's not going to be out until, looks like
6014720	6019720	Spring 2011, not Fall 2010 like they originally said.
6019720	6023680	So they say it's a delay in production.
6023680	6024680	So let's...
6024680	6026920	More games getting delayed.
6026920	6027920	Same story every week.
6027920	6028920	I hope it's for a good reason.
6028920	6030280	I hope it's for a good reason.
6030280	6039000	And finally, Doctor Who, Mazes of Time, will be out for the iPhone and iPad, actually for
6039000	6040840	the holiday season.
6040840	6044120	I hope that's going to be in the US as well.
6044120	6054000	But basically, it's being put out by Tag that's done other apps for different Channel 4 shows
6054000	6058720	in the UK, Come Dine with Me and Peep Show.
6058720	6060720	So maybe that'll be cool.
6060720	6061720	Alright.
6061720	6066020	Are we ready to get to some Twitter topics and get to the tweets that people have been
6066020	6067020	tweeting us all night.
6067020	6068020	Are we ready?
6068020	6069020	Yes, let's.
6069020	6072120	We already know that it's a great Twitter tonight because of the whole jetpack cat thing
6072120	6073120	that's been going on.
6073120	6075120	So I'm very excited about that.
6075120	6076760	Yes, we did start a new hashtag.
6076760	6077760	We're hoping you'll catch on.
6077760	6078760	Alright, anyhow.
6078760	6083360	For now, going to the Twitter and some of the other tweets we got this week at twitter.com
6083360	6084360	slash OLR.
6084360	6091040	We'll start it off with Fun ET Man wants to know, any of you at OLR play Donkey Kong Country
6091040	6094200	Returns or Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom?
6094200	6096760	I don't even know if I've heard of that second game.
6096760	6098520	Donkey Kong Country Returns, not yet.
6098520	6104280	The second one's kind of a little bit like that last Guardian game, you have like this
6104280	6110520	kind of golem character that you're having help you around like a giant monster thing.
6110520	6114320	Oh, now that I'm looking at it, this looks kind of cool actually.
6114320	6117280	Donkey Kong Country Returns looks pretty cool.
6117280	6122720	Sorry, I'm looking at a little, wow, that's really stylistic.
6122720	6125880	Is that on an arcade or is that like an actual retail game?
6125880	6127040	That's a retail game.
6127040	6129540	That looks kind of awesome actually.
6129540	6132640	The problem is these games are $60, you know what I mean?
6132640	6133640	That game is $40.
6133640	6134640	Really?
6134640	6135640	Yes.
6135640	6136640	This actually looks kind of awesome.
6136640	6141760	And if you shopped on Amazon, you could have gotten in for $30.
6141760	6142760	Really?
6142760	6144320	That looks kind of neat.
6144320	6147960	Sorry, I know it's like radio and me looking at a trailer is not that exciting, but check
6147960	6148960	that out.
6148960	6154400	Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom, M-A-J-I-N and the Forsaken Kingdom.
6154400	6156820	Donkey Kong Returns, I'm kind of like, eh.
6156820	6160880	My Wii is still in a box and this game does not really motivate me to get it out of the
6160880	6161880	box.
6161880	6162880	You put your Wii in a box?
6162880	6163880	Wii in a box.
6163880	6164880	My Wii in a box.
6164880	6165880	Step shift.
6165880	6169680	All right, Spaznator PSN says, if I can get through tonight on the phone, I'll call in
6169680	6172160	giving a mini review of Voodoo on the PS3.
6172160	6173160	What's Voodoo?
6173160	6174160	V-U-D-U?
6174160	6176200	It's a movie streaming service.
6176200	6177640	Oh, I didn't know that.
6177640	6178640	Oh, okay.
6178640	6181160	So it's like a Netflix competitor type thing?
6181160	6184760	Uh, something like that I guess.
6184760	6188240	Now here's why I like having a live chat room, because when we're sitting here going, I don't
6188240	6191300	know the game, I've never played the game, our chatters help fill in the gaps here.
6191300	6194920	So, uh, Miklotov in our chat room says, Donkey Kong Returns is hard as hell.
6194920	6199120	And SolarFlare says, Donkey Kong Returns is only fun with a group of friends and booze.
6199120	6202280	There you go.
6202280	6207640	Deathwishing says, Rob should dust off his PS3 because Konami's space on home has DDR
6207640	6208640	in it.
6208640	6209640	I didn't know.
6209640	6212840	So they brought DDR to PlayStation Home now I guess?
6212840	6213840	I'll look at it.
6213840	6216520	I haven't played the PS3 in a while, but I'll take a look.
6216520	6219480	It's not that I hate the PS3, it's just there haven't been a lot of games on it I've been
6219480	6220480	wanting to check out.
6220480	6223680	Uh, and is 3D Dot Game Heroes worth a buy?
6223680	6224680	Yes.
6224680	6226000	If you like the Zelda games, yes.
6226000	6228760	Although this game is a lot harder than the Zelda games.
6228760	6232920	If you're a video game nerd, which you probably are if you're listening to this show, um,
6232920	6237160	there's lots of video game nerd references all over the game, uh, and it's very, very
6237160	6238160	Zelda-like.
6238160	6240160	And you can probably find that stuff on sale.
6240160	6243340	I mean, it was only $30 originally when it came out, right?
6243340	6246840	So now you can probably find it for like $15 or $20 and it's absolutely worth it at that
6246840	6247840	price.
6247840	6250200	The only drawback, it's not a very long game once you know what you're doing.
6250200	6252480	You'll probably beat it in like six hours.
6252480	6254320	So, something to consider.
6254320	6256320	I would say if you can find it on sale, absolutely.
6256320	6258320	Don't pass it up.
6258320	6262640	Um, moving on to some other tweets.
6262640	6266640	Some people are venting that they weren't able to listen to OLR.
6266640	6267640	Sorry.
6267640	6273600	Uh, DJ Rama S says, IGN's top 10 worst games of 2010.
6273600	6276040	I had a problem with three of the titles.
6276040	6279680	I'm not even going to look at this and I'm going to tell you, they're probably trying
6279680	6282780	to just create controversy to get page hits, period.
6282780	6287400	They want people to dig this and what have you and just get more page hits.
6287400	6292920	It's probably not really accurate, but I'm going to look now and see what, what, what
6292920	6293920	they came up with.
6293920	6298600	And again, this is a link from DJ Rama S on Twitter, it's IGN's top 10 worst games of
6298600	6299600	2010.
6299600	6302120	And he says he has a problem with three of these titles.
6302120	6307520	Number 10, Sonic the four, Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the four, Sonic the Hedgehog four episode
6307520	6308520	one.
6308520	6310680	I can see where that's landing on people's lists.
6310680	6313760	It was a bit of a disappointment for a lot of people.
6313760	6315760	Number nine, the PlayStation move.
6315760	6317880	See, that's not even really a game.
6317880	6321080	I think that's just there to, it's just controversy.
6321080	6323280	Number eight, Lost Planet two.
6323280	6326580	Number seven, Kane and Lynch two, Dog Days.
6326580	6328120	Number six, Crackdown two.
6328120	6331200	Would you say that was one of the 10 worst games of the year, Loki?
6331200	6335120	It's not the worst game, but it was definitely a disappointment compared to the last one.
6335120	6337840	But it's not, I wouldn't say that's the worst game.
6337840	6340800	That's not even a bad game, really.
6340800	6342920	Number five, Microsoft Connect.
6342920	6344200	Oh, fuck off.
6344200	6346400	It's too early to tell if Connect is...
6346400	6348280	They gave it a good review even.
6348280	6350920	I, no, that's just, it's for page hits.
6350920	6355480	This is why you do not read corporate media websites.
6355480	6357720	I mean, this is a, ugh.
6357720	6361840	Anyhow, four, Fable three.
6361840	6363880	I've been hearing raves about Fable three.
6363880	6366760	They gave it good reviews also.
6366760	6369640	Number three, Medal of Honor.
6369640	6373720	Number two, Gran Turismo five.
6373720	6376360	And number one, Final Fantasy 13.
6376360	6377520	Fuck off.
6377520	6378520	Fuck off.
6378520	6380960	You put 13 on the list and not 14.
6380960	6382640	No, why did they put, okay, they put Gran Turismo...
6382640	6386120	Your opinion is invalid, person that wrote this article.
6386120	6387120	Fuck off.
6387120	6389520	Now, is that even an article, or is that like a blog post on it?
6389520	6390520	I don't even know.
6390520	6391520	I stopped caring.
6391520	6392520	It's a piece of poop.
6392520	6394520	It's probably, it's just a joke.
6394520	6395520	Who gives a crap?
6395520	6396520	I don't know.
6396520	6397520	It says slash articles.
6397520	6400200	Must it be with their eight, like, podcasts that they have?
6400200	6402680	Doesn't say blog, no, it says editor.
6402680	6405120	There's some dude that has the editor badge or whatever.
6405120	6406120	Great.
6406120	6407120	Yeah.
6407120	6408120	That's awesome.
6408120	6409120	Yeah.
6409120	6411280	I'm reading some comments in our chat room.
6411280	6412280	IGN equals fail.
6412280	6414640	IGN equals we need more hits.
6414640	6417720	I bet FFX2 is worse than Final Fantasy 13.
6417720	6419920	That's what you get for reading IGN.
6419920	6420920	There you go.
6420920	6421920	Enough said.
6421920	6423360	All right.
6423360	6424960	Tiger Claw sends us some links.
6424960	6425960	He sent us a few.
6425960	6427320	I don't know which ones to read.
6427320	6430760	Oh, I like this one, and this didn't make our show roll tonight, and I remember reading
6430760	6431760	this.
6431760	6437060	Tiger Claw says this is a link, actor Billy Bob Thornton, speaking of people that need
6437060	6445680	to fuck off, blames video games for the death of quality in Hollywood.
6445680	6450320	Here's some lovely quotes from Billy Bob Thornton, because when I want an expert on video games,
6450320	6453120	I think, I wonder what Billy Bob Thornton thinks.
6453120	6456560	I even actually have a sticker that says WWBBTD.
6456560	6463640	I just like the word lovely and Billy Bob Thornton going together.
6463640	6469200	It says the man who used to wear a vial of blood around his neck.
6469200	6472920	Why are game blogs even reporting what this asshole has to say?
6472920	6474680	Why is he fucking relevant?
6474680	6476960	Why are we not talking more about Jetpack Cat?
6476960	6478960	Why are we not more talking about her boobs?
6478960	6483280	They're right here in the studio, and yet I'm talking about some dickhead Billy Bob
6483280	6486120	Thornton story.
6486120	6487560	It's where every gamer has a voice.
6487560	6488560	That's the stuff they tweeted.
6488560	6493280	Next in all games radio, Marissa's tits.
6493280	6496560	What we need is Jetpack Cat to bounce off your boobies.
6496560	6503080	The boyfriend every morning comes up to me, he does the cat paw thing on the cleavage,
6503080	6509000	you know, like when they're adjusting to get into bed.
6509000	6511880	Anyway if you care with this asshole, thanks.
6511880	6516060	They're geared towards the video game playing generation, and these video games, which I'm
6516060	6520740	on my sum about constantly, these games are people killing for fun, and I think traditionally
6520740	6524560	in movies there's always been some kind of lesson in the violent movies.
6524560	6529980	By the way, his next picture is called Faster, and it stars Dwayne the Rock Johnson as an
6529980	6534520	ex-convict on a quest for revenge against the people who set him up in which the actor
6534520	6536480	plays a flawed cop.
6536480	6540360	Oh, and by the way, he goes on a killing spree.
6540360	6544960	Not the cop, but, you know.
6544960	6545960	Fuck off.
6545960	6546960	Alright.
6546960	6556640	Let's see, what else, do we have any other, Maginomicon, I'm sorry if I'm saying this
6556640	6564480	incorrectly, Maginomyicon, Maginomicon, sends us this tweet here.
6564480	6568160	I don't know, the title is kind of catching me here, it's called penalizing users of big
6568160	6571560	breasts.
6571560	6576620	I think I'll also penalize players for making female characters with large breasts by applying
6576620	6578040	common sense to that too.
6578040	6581280	Oh, this must be from like a role playing blog.
6581280	6585200	So like if you're going to make a female character with big boobies, just so that she can have
6585200	6591720	big boobies, this DM wants to have decreased maximum stamina, stamina drains faster, and
6591720	6594800	you can't wear some sizes of torso armor.
6594800	6598840	Have you ever found, Marissa, that there's certain torso armor you're unable to wear?
6598840	6600800	Because I somehow doubt that.
6600800	6602320	I have torso armor.
6602320	6603640	Actually, Rob.
6603640	6604640	What?
6604640	6612880	I played D&D once, and our, if we were to, we would actually have to roll for fitting
6612880	6616680	sometimes for certain armors, depending on different stats.
6616680	6618560	I'm serious.
6618560	6622520	He would actually say if you're going to be extra, especially for the guys who would play
6622520	6628160	female characters and would make them that busty, yes I have many a D&D game where guys
6628160	6629160	have played women.
6629160	6630160	Alright.
6630160	6636000	Yeah, they were too busty, yeah, they'd actually roll sizes for armor, and then make them get
6636000	6637160	a different class.
6637160	6642600	It was actually, he was very nitpicky, but I've been at real tabletop games where they've
6642600	6643600	done that.
6643600	6650340	You know, way back when I was in high school, I used to play D&D, and everybody was a guy
6650340	6654160	in the group, so of course I had to play the girl, because it's funny to have, you gotta
6654160	6657400	have a chick there, but then all the guys are like, well what if we want to hit on you,
6657400	6660280	and I'm like, well my character's a lesbian, so don't even bother.
6660280	6666080	So I played the one lesbian, and she was, I decided to play the very stereotypical man-hating
6666080	6670400	lesbian because it was high school, you know, we're all stupid ass kids, so it was fun.
6670400	6671400	It was a lot of fun.
6671400	6674960	I always threatened to kick their ass, and it was good, good times.
6674960	6681040	I mean, I have boob armor, and the Ute's brassiere's Nazi bras, so, I think I've told my stories
6681040	6682040	before.
6682040	6683040	I still love that.
6683040	6686720	I made her do that for Dan, because Dan hadn't heard it.
6686720	6691360	By the way, the name is pronounced, and he's in chat, so sorry about that, Majinomicon,
6691360	6692360	Majinomicon.
6692360	6696040	Oh, light Necronomicon, but Majinomicon.
6696040	6697040	Yes.
6697040	6703080	Let's see, we've got, other stories from Tigerclaw, I want to read at least one other one of these
6703080	6704080	here.
6704080	6706960	How about the Kinect being hacked into a Super Mario Brothers emulator controller?
6706960	6709480	Yes, somebody has hacked their Kinect.
6709480	6713600	There's this whole little video here of some dude on YouTube, playing, oh it's that same
6713600	6715980	guy I saw in a video last week.
6715980	6721720	He hacked his Kinect, and he's actually running to the right and left, and jumping to jump.
6721720	6723920	That's actually kind of cool.
6723920	6729280	When he jumps, Mario jumps, and when he goes to the right side, the character moves right.
6729280	6731920	When he goes to the left side, the character moves left.
6731920	6733620	Okay, neat.
6733620	6739040	They're starting to get a little craftier with these Kinect add-ons, so, you go, guy.
6739040	6745680	His name on YouTube, if you want to look at the video yourself, Yankeyan, Y-A-N-K-E-Y-A-N.
6745680	6747440	Check that out.
6747440	6754480	You can see him kind of like doing the Mario Brothers dance, it's a lot of fun there.
6754480	6760720	One more tweet from Dark Kiskay sends us, is AC Brotherhood amazing but pretty buggy?
6760720	6764200	I don't see a link with that, but has anyone played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood?
6764200	6765640	I've heard really good things about it.
6765640	6769800	A lot of my guildies in WoW are like, can't play WoW right now, I'm playing Assassin's
6769800	6771640	Creed, sorry.
6771640	6774160	So I sadly have not played the game myself.
6774160	6777560	Gee, another console game being bugged on release?
6777560	6779260	What a surprise.
6779260	6780260	What a big surprise.
6780260	6785600	That's going to do it for Twitters this week, Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send
6785600	6787480	us some tweets for next week.
6787480	6791720	Meanwhile, back into some gaming news, Loki.
6791720	6794640	So yeah, there's some other interesting stuff.
6794640	6801020	This is kind of neat because the game came out so long ago, but apparently now, Axl Rose
6801020	6807040	is suing Activision over the inclusion of Slash in Guitar Hero 3.
6807040	6813720	Apparently they're saying that they filed a $20 million lawsuit against the publisher
6813720	6819840	for associating Guns N' Roses music, specifically Welcome to the Jungle with the former Guns
6819840	6827280	N' Roses guitarist Slash and his new band Velvet Revolver in 2007's Guitar Hero 3 Legends
6827280	6828280	of Rock.
6828280	6832560	It says, Activision had permission to use Welcome to the Jungle, but according to court
6832560	6839560	documents obtained by Radar Online, broke its contract with Rose by including imagery
6839560	6845280	of Slash in the game and offering music by Velvet Revolver as downloadable content.
6845280	6851460	It says the juxtaposition exploits the prior association between Slash and Guns N' Roses
6851460	6854400	and promotes Slash and Velvet Revolver.
6854400	6861760	Their separate interest includes VR tracks as available downloads, all of which was and
6861760	6867120	is indirectly contrary to the contractual obligations of the defendants.
6867120	6869800	That was a query in the filing.
6869800	6873440	And let's see.
6873440	6876580	How were sales of Chinese Democracy, just out of curiosity?
6876580	6879680	That album that took what, like 10 years to make?
6879680	6880680	I have no idea.
6880680	6881680	That's not commented on.
6881680	6883000	Is he being a bitter Betty?
6883000	6886400	Because I think Axl Rose is being a bitter Betty.
6886400	6893880	It says, you know apparently there's a comment, Activision's EVP of Music Affairs, Tim Riley
6893880	6900180	is quoted as saying, come on Beta, you can't believe everything you read on the internet
6900180	6908600	in response to rumors of Slash's inclusion heard by Roses rep Beta Labace, I guess.
6908600	6914480	Whether Rose's claims of treachery on Activision's part turned out to be true or not, that remains
6914480	6915480	to be determined.
6915480	6919800	Oh, we actually have another comment that's coming in right now over email from Activision,
6919800	6923920	official comment on this whole piece, quote, fuck you, Rose.
6923920	6924920	What do you know?
6924920	6925920	There it is.
6925920	6927700	It's more of Axl Rose being an ass.
6927700	6930000	It's Axl Rose being Axl Rose, actually.
6930000	6936400	Well, it sounds like here that I, well, I don't know, they said that.
6936400	6940240	It's just weird, like a lot of these lawsuits, I guess, take a really long time, maybe, I
6940240	6944320	mean, because they're on what, Guitar Hero, it'd be the equivalent of Guitar Hero like
6944320	6945320	6?
6945320	6946320	Yeah, this is about Guitar Hero 3.
6946320	6947320	Yeah.
6947320	6950560	Well, I mean, if Slash actually has songwriting credit on that song, I don't know how legitimate
6950560	6955240	that claim could really be because, you know, he's allowed to be represented as a musician
6955240	6957480	unless they want, you know, make it not exist.
6957480	6965200	Here's the thing, is it's not really saying, you know, it's just, it's just because Slash
6965200	6970680	is in the game, I understand that people would associate Slash maybe with Guns N' Roses,
6970680	6973480	but you know, he's kind of moved on now.
6973480	6978240	I mean, just because there's a Guns N' Roses song in there, and Slash is in there, doesn't
6978240	6985520	necessarily mean, you know, that, I don't know, I think if Slash is independent at this
6985520	6988720	point, I don't necessarily associate Slash strictly with Guns N' Roses.
6988720	6993720	I associate Slash with like that kind of like fro-y, hairy thing he has.
6993720	6997400	It's not even really like a fro though, it's like a, you know, he just has beautiful hair,
6997400	7000600	you just want to run your fingers through it even though you know it's a wig.
7000600	7004560	What exactly is wrong with associating all that stuff anyways?
7004560	7008040	I mean, what kind of damages were actually caused to Guns N' Roses?
7008040	7013080	I mean, because I think Guitar Hero 3, you know, arguably was probably a pretty good
7013080	7020240	game, I mean, at the time, and, um, you know, I don't think it's really negative for them.
7020240	7023720	I mean, didn't they have Chinese Democracy as, you know, download content?
7023720	7024720	I love this.
7024720	7029080	As J100Matt says, well, you know what they say, every rose has its thorn up its ass.
7029080	7032760	Uh, Jiove Dea, Jiove Dea, I love this.
7032760	7035080	Also, it's a guitar game.
7035080	7038680	Who is the guitar player in the band?
7038680	7042000	I mean, that's just what Activision should take to court right there.
7042000	7043680	Jiove Dea should be a lawyer.
7043680	7046240	There you go.
7046240	7048040	Ah, whatever.
7048040	7049960	Whatever, dude.
7049960	7054680	I also love the comment here from Death Wishing, it was a while ago, but at chat.orangehonestrody.com,
7054680	7057240	Axl Rose needs money for cocaine and blow.
7057240	7059680	Yeah, that's what it's come to.
7059680	7064240	Well, let's move on to something happy, bouncy, fun, and talk about Virtual Console.
7064240	7068160	I thought for a second there we were going to talk about Jetpack Cat.
7068160	7072040	No, we kind of talked as much as we can about Jetpack Cat tonight, but we'll talk about
7072040	7077120	some possible Virtual Console releases coming from Taito, because of some recent trademark
7077120	7081720	applications, suggesting that some Super Nintendo games are going to make a comeback, including
7081720	7089640	Darius Twin, Lufia and the Fortress of Doom, and Lufia 2, Rise of the Sinistrols.
7089640	7093760	Those were all very recent trademarks that were applied for.
7093760	7096720	That means that these games could be coming out on Virtual Console very soon, usually
7096720	7100120	that is what this ends up meaning.
7100120	7104360	Just so you know, Darius Twin was actually released on the Japan version earlier this
7104360	7105360	year.
7105360	7109680	Lufia, I don't think, has been released just yet, but it looks like it might be.
7109680	7113400	Well hooray for Virtual Console actually getting some new content, that's got to be exciting
7113400	7114400	for them, right?
7114400	7115400	Good games too.
7115400	7116400	Uh huh.
7116400	7117400	So there you go.
7117400	7125600	Uh, no, not Darius Twin, not Marisa, that's not Darius Twin, just so you know.
7125600	7127840	Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have?
7127840	7136640	Well there is some new download content for Castlevania, Harmony of Despair, for 240 points.
7136640	7144480	You can use Julius Belmont and Yoko Belnades, who I guess was from one of the older ones
7144480	7148480	from Castlevania 3, Saifo was it?
7148480	7156720	Anyway, Julius has the extra long whip that can work as a grappling hook, and Yoko has
7156720	7163360	magic, which definitely goes back to the old games, so that's pretty cool.
7163360	7168400	So let's just hope that it improves the game some.
7168400	7170400	Alright.
7170400	7172520	Yes.
7172520	7179720	This is kind of interesting and totally something I could see on Top Gear, but there was an
7179720	7185160	article, can a video game make you into an elite race driver?
7185160	7188080	And apparently the answer is no.
7188080	7190560	Actually you're wrong, the answer is yes.
7190560	7196640	Apparently there is an extremely realistic racing simulator called iRacing, no it's not
7196640	7206240	for the iPod or iPad, apparently the top driver won $10,000 despite never driving over 100
7206240	7208020	miles an hour in real life.
7208020	7212640	Top Gear, they put them into an actual race car to see if the digital skills translate
7212640	7219760	into a real racing prowess, and apparently he did pretty well.
7219760	7224480	He clocked in a lap time three seconds off of what an experienced driver would be expected
7224480	7225480	to deliver.
7225480	7232640	Of course they say three seconds is an eternity in motorsports, but considering this is his
7232640	7235460	very first time, it's pretty awesome.
7235460	7241280	His braking points were spot on, and he seemed firm and precise on the throttle, and in the
7241280	7246440	fastest corner he's entering 100 miles an hour compared to an experienced driver's 110
7246440	7254160	miles an hour, a sign of absolute confidence and natural feel for grip as Top Gear wrote.
7254160	7262080	And so apparently I guess training on a really, I mean it kind of makes sense, if you're training
7262080	7269600	on a game that's an extreme simulation of the real thing, it's almost like doing the
7269600	7272040	real thing, since it's a simulation of that.
7272040	7274040	But can you change a tire?
7274040	7279520	That's not a driver's job, okay, that's what your pit crew is for.
7279520	7282660	It just takes down sexiness points, that's all I'm saying.
7282660	7286280	My only worry is that, you see, I look at this and go, well hold on though, just because
7286280	7290440	I play Microsoft Flight Simulator, or whatever they're calling it now, Microsoft Flight,
7290440	7292440	doesn't mean I can fly a plane.
7292440	7293640	But we should see if you can.
7293640	7294640	No we shouldn't.
7294640	7297120	No, they have simulators for that.
7297120	7300600	I just, but see, my thought is that, and it was hilarious, it's supposed to work the
7300600	7301600	other way around.
7301600	7306160	If I know how to fly a plane, then Microsoft Flight Simulator is supposed to be a way for
7306160	7310360	me to kind of like, I don't know, I guess practice without practicing, or sort of like
7310360	7312680	relive that experience from the comfort of my own home.
7312680	7317120	You're saying that if I'm good at an arcade game, I can't go fight off an alien race?
7317120	7320120	You know I believe that is what I'm saying, yes, actually.
7320120	7324600	That's not, I don't want to live in that world.
7324600	7325600	I think you do, I'm sorry.
7325600	7329160	I think the problem though would be, I mean, although that actually does sound pretty awesome
7329160	7334640	is the, you're still lacking the intuitiveness that you get, you know, if you're a good car
7334640	7339800	driver and you know all its hiccups and you could sense gravity movement within the car
7339800	7343680	itself and when it needs, you know, something, I mean I know this isn't a regular driving
7343680	7347920	simulation but still, you know, drivers get an intuition about their own car and all the
7347920	7348920	moving parts and everything.
7348920	7352440	Of course with the simulators that I play, I'd need an Uzi and I'd be firing at the back
7352440	7355960	of their car and destroying their tires, so.
7355960	7360040	Does the simulator simulate like the G-forces and all that stuff too though?
7360040	7361040	No, see.
7361040	7364880	Isn't that a big part of racing, you know, being able to physically handle it?
7364880	7370160	Well that's the thing, it says even though, you know, he may have the skills to do it,
7370160	7375920	he's not in physical, perfect physical shape for being a racer but they're saying that
7375920	7376920	you're young enough.
7376920	7379520	So what they're saying is by playing the computer games you're still fat.
7379520	7386000	No, it's not that at all, it's just saying that, you know, you're just not, you haven't
7386000	7391840	experienced those G-forces and stuff and the physical toll of driving that fast, you know,
7391840	7396300	you have to compensate for that and if you can't do that with a simulator, then you're
7396300	7398120	not really ready for the real thing.
7398120	7401440	For the record though, I mean most 16 year olds drive like they learned on Grand Theft
7401440	7403440	Auto anyway, so.
7403440	7404440	True.
7404440	7409400	There's some real dipshit drivers out there on the road and I'm always like, how did you
7409400	7410400	get a license?
7410400	7411400	Jesus.
7411400	7417560	Alright, anyhow, how about a story about Tron, yes Tron, we heart Tron, which by the way,
7417560	7424700	the Tron soundtrack is out around the internets and sexy.
7424700	7430200	Don't download it expecting a Daft Punk album though, it's, oh my gosh, things are crashing,
7430200	7433520	it's a movie score and a damn good one I gotta say.
7433520	7437240	Anyhow, Tron the video game, Tron Evolution, supposedly does have some of the Daft Punk
7437240	7439320	songs in it, as we talked about last week.
7439320	7443280	Also Tron Evolution is going to have day one downloadable content.
7443280	7448260	So the PC, the PS3 and the 360 versions of the game, they will actually include codes
7448260	7453200	that will allow you to unlock some additional multiplayer maps and a character skin that
7453200	7455240	is basically Sam Flynn.
7455240	7460160	So I guess think of that as your whole encouragement to not buy the game used, some additional
7460160	7465760	maps and the code and all that, yes, but that's some of the downloadable day one DLC.
7465760	7469880	So at least they're not charging you to play the game online if it's a used copy, but yeah,
7469880	7473200	only with the new copy are you going to get some of this extra stuff.
7473200	7478840	And that's usually the way publishers do it, they don't pull this dick-ass move like EA
7478840	7486360	or THQ, EA at least will give you a trial, and it's only really with their sports games,
7486360	7491800	so if you want to play online, most of the sports games you're probably buying new anyways,
7491800	7499160	but like THQ with their martial arts games and stuff, it's just a dick move, I'm sorry.
7499160	7503560	Sorry, no trial whatsoever, you have to pay money up front if you don't buy this game
7503560	7504560	new.
7504560	7510000	Alright, well we're going to open up the mailbag at mailbag at orangelauntrader.com and dive
7510000	7515120	into the email bag, and Dark Soccer is going to go in and pull out some emails and read
7515120	7516800	them for us.
7516800	7518280	Just two.
7518280	7519440	Just two?
7519440	7522480	And it says, non-credible rumor.
7522480	7527880	Just a silly rumor I may or may not have heard, Treyarch may be doing a side project to bring
7527880	7532520	casual gamers to Star Trek Online, allowing players to establish a Klingon salon.
7532520	7537760	The first salon to be set up, Modern Warfare.
7537760	7540080	I'm going to guess this is just a joke, Dark Soccer.
7540080	7542440	Yes it is, that's what I said, incredible.
7542440	7549180	And a congratulations to our winner of our Castlevania Symphony of the Night code.
7549180	7552560	It goes to Mike, and enjoy it.
7552560	7556560	You are quite welcome, he says, oh my gosh, thank you so much, I love you guys, heart
7556560	7557560	smile.
7557560	7559880	There's probably like a hundred guys named Mike that listen to this show.
7559880	7561680	Well this, Mike who won.
7561680	7563600	Okay, Mike who won.
7563600	7564600	Mike who won.
7564600	7568160	That's now your last name, Mike who won.
7568160	7569160	The winner is you.
7569160	7570160	That's it?
7570160	7571160	That's it.
7571160	7573160	We've had some kind of like, not very full mailbag recently.
7573160	7574160	Turkey comma.
7574160	7575160	I guess.
7575160	7576160	Turkey comma.
7576160	7578120	Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com if you want to send us an email.
7578120	7581480	You really need to fill her up for next week, like I want part B to be nothing but Dark
7581480	7582480	Soccer reading emails.
7582480	7583480	I'll be fine.
7583480	7584480	Do or die.
7584480	7585480	Alright.
7585480	7589480	Well, let's do the FUs of the week then.
7589480	7607320	All this is bad, here is justice, here is punishment, here is, this is fucked up.
7607320	7611460	Nephew to money and my lack thereof.
7611460	7616560	I want my severance check, do you hear me you bastards?
7616560	7619080	But they might if you bang a little louder.
7619080	7623280	But I am glad to be free of that horrid horrid place.
7623280	7624280	Okay.
7624280	7634900	I have to say it nephew to the fact that this week is actually a regular week and not a
7634900	7642120	short week like last week was, I don't know, I get spoiled by the short weeks, it's awesome.
7642120	7647000	But uh, yeah, nephew that, nephew the round table for forgetting to put my order in when
7647000	7648000	I ordered it.
7648000	7651960	That's why I call ahead, you know, because if I wanted it not ready I would just go in
7651960	7657880	and order it, but you know, that's technicality I guess.
7657880	7660840	I don't really have a lot to be angsty about right now, things are pretty good all things
7660840	7665040	considered I'll just say F you to the fact that I had a nice long weekend and it's over.
7665040	7668160	Oh F you to the fact that I stayed up till four in the morning last night, that really
7668160	7671800	wasn't smart because like I have to get up at four in the morning on Thursday to catch
7671800	7675920	a flight to Burbank, so that really wasn't smart of me.
7675920	7676920	Just saying.
7676920	7680080	Marissa, do you have any FUs you want to throw out there?
7680080	7681080	Maybe you have some angst?
7681080	7684480	It's my shock, anyone who knows me, but I'm not mad about anything right now.
7684480	7689040	I guess F you to not being able to stay out here long enough, but I'm having a great time
7689040	7690040	so thank you.
7690040	7693880	Well you're on vacation so you know it's hard to give an F you, it's like you know if like
7693880	7698360	if I'm in Hawaii and I'm full of FUs if it's not about like some bitch stewardess or bad
7698360	7700880	hotel service like I'm really like kind of a dick.
7700880	7703480	Oh you know what I do have an F you, I have an F you to the fact that I always have to
7703480	7708720	fly on screaming baby airlines.
7708720	7709720	Thank you for flying.
7709720	7710720	Come fly with us.
7710720	7711720	Exactly.
7711720	7716040	Whatever happens on good old fashioned days you just give your kid a bunch of Benadryl
7716040	7718520	before they get on the plane so they sleep through the whole flight.
7718520	7722280	Well if you're flying, you're flying the same path I do a lot, that's Burbank to Sacramento
7722280	7723280	right?
7723280	7724280	So you must be going on Southwest.
7724280	7725280	Of course.
7725280	7726760	Southwest is just a greyhound bus with wings.
7726760	7727760	Exactly.
7727760	7732800	I love how the stewardess just don't care anymore like do you want peanuts?
7732800	7735240	You want to have some peanuts?
7735240	7739800	The thing that pisses me off is that I used to be neurotic about signing on 24 hours in
7739800	7745840	advance so I could get the A1 boarding pass, but now they got smart and they sell like
7745840	7750080	one through thirty for an additional ten bucks so I could be the first one on at like you
7750080	7755960	know 24 hours before and I'll have like B1 to board and like that is soul crushing.
7755960	7761800	I used to have to do that for my boss, she was always flying Southwest if you're a law
7761800	7766800	firm and yeah she was completely anal retentive about that though but the funniest thing now
7766800	7770040	is that, I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but I said maybe like if you're a B
7770040	7774080	and it's really obvious and now they have the standing in the number order, don't give
7774080	7778720	a shit, they just take you like you know you don't have to stand at like you could stand
7778720	7781680	at 16 if you're number 50 they don't care.
7781680	7785600	Right yeah it's not exact but you definitely have those people that are like oh excuse
7785600	7790400	me I believe you need to be on this side of the sign because you're holding that number.
7790400	7795120	You just put your hand over that part just like where you're holding it you know.
7795120	7797120	I know.
7797120	7800600	So yeah although I didn't have to get scanner molested which was nice because I was knocking
7800600	7802320	off for that picture.
7802320	7806640	I've had the nudie pictures taken I was in a really bad mood the day it was at the Oakland
7806640	7810640	airport and that was the day that the tires caught on fire like go back a few episodes
7810640	7815000	is when I was trying to do like a secret trip or whatever we just the whole thing just got
7815000	7818320	ruined and I was at the Oakland airport and I had a nudie picture taken it was like that
7818320	7823680	part of the day where like I just didn't even care anymore and like it wasn't the part that
7823680	7828280	they were taking the picture to bother me but they were just being such jerks like you
7828280	7832360	need to put your hands up sir it's like give someone a badge and it just gives them the
7832360	7837000	right to be a total asshole you know it's like god learn customers as someone who taught
7837000	7842120	customer service for nine years a lot of those like security type people really bother me
7842120	7846120	really bother me yeah they actually at least from my experience they're really nice at
7846120	7850480	Burbank but I mean you talk about those image scanners I mean there's plenty of images have
7850480	7853960	already shown up showed up on the internet okay you take a scan of somebody that has
7853960	7858240	gigantic boobs or a big way or something unusual on your body they don't get paid enough to
7858240	7863200	be professional I'm sorry the doctor they're totally gonna be like hey guys look at this
7863200	7868000	check this out and you know like I said you know I'll opt for the pat down and I mean
7868000	7872320	unlike anyone you know over 14 nowadays I actually haven't that that picture of me from
7872320	7878400	the site is like the dirtiest thing of me I'll find dry right um but um but yeah I'll
7878400	7882760	opt for the pat down and my professor was saying in my law class that um that they even
7882760	7889280	check your cleavage now I'm like great this will take two days I better get the hard hat
7889280	7894400	on in the canary you know what my cleavage is like you know that bag in a Mary Poppins
7894400	7898080	where she just pulls out still I can plug like a lamp I don't like cleavage and you
7898080	7902880	know like I just you know just she has an umbrella with a parrot head that talks to
7902880	7908720	her yeah her boobs exactly so airports are fun no I don't mind having the nudie pictures
7908720	7913480	taking is just like you know what what's sit here and memorize it why don't you just strike
7913480	7917880	a pose that's what my one of my friends when we were at the airport she got picked for
7917880	7921440	around when we went to Boston for PAX East funny enough she got picked for the random
7921440	7925000	screening because then it was not everybody did it it was just random or I don't know
7925000	7928880	if maybe it's still that way now so I didn't have to do it but Amanda had to do it and
7928880	7934780	she she was excited she's like I get to do the nudie picture so she's like running over
7934780	7937880	there and she like totally does this pose where she has her hands up and she's like
7937880	7941400	do this because she's fucking adorable to begin with and then she does this whole like
7941400	7946160	little like pose thing when she's standing there and I'm just like you are having way
7946160	7949640	too much fun with the nudie picture taking I like the people that have the idea of doing
7949640	7955560	the the spinal tap thing and having a cucumber wrapped in a wrap and foil in your pants so
7955560	7961140	you know my spinal tap it oh boy when that is that can you bring can you technically
7961140	7965800	bring a cucumber wrapped in foil well they try they find it in the scanner but you cannot
7965800	7971640	as they put in the spinal tap that was lunch I needed something to suck on on the plane
7971640	7980000	anyhow let's move on hey more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the skype
7980000	7985600	line at 1877 game OLR as if this show couldn't go any further down the toilet we're about
7985600	7990680	to open it up to callers 1877 game OLR but not just yet we still have a couple more stories
7990680	7999160	for you guys yeah this is kind of neat apparently EA Tiburon is rumored to be in early development
7999160	8005800	for a new NFL blitz because hey Midway sucked it up with that series and Warner didn't do
8005800	8011960	too much better so now they're gonna give it a new shot since hey you know NBA Jam did
8011960	8018760	all right and so I don't know NFL blitz could be kind of fun I liked NFL blitz someone played
8018760	8025480	any NBA Jam yet though this is a new one but they say they probably won't arrive until
8025480	8035480	2012 so it's rumored for now all right I like rumors I guess NFL blitz is kind of cool so
8035480	8039680	be interesting if that's coming back as well as NBA Jam did earlier this year I'm sorry
8039680	8044600	I'm just distracted by a link that was posted in chat by solar flare fig leaf yes it's a
8044600	8050120	it's like I guess you can buy like panties or boxer briefs or whatever that have a giant
8050120	8055240	fig leaf on them that are made of some type of radiation proof material so when they scan
8055240	8059600	you the little fig leaf will come up instead to be for bras too yeah oh you can get you
8059600	8068640	get the hands for the bras like the barber Streisand dress or I don't know if you've
8068640	8074240	seen burlesque yet but there's there's definitely a nod to that there's been a hot mess of glitz
8074240	8079360	and glam I did see burlesque this week the day after Thanksgiving and it was actually
8079360	8085000	no I saw it on Thanksgiving and it was it was it was very very very gay it was share
8085000	8091240	the best more complaining that it wasn't hot mess enough that's it's it's for look if you're
8091240	8096000	gonna go see burlesque and you're gonna go see a movie starring Sharon Christina Aguilera
8096000	8100400	you ought to know exactly what you're gonna get and the movie does deliver you you get
8100400	8108240	exactly that but I'm just saying it's it's it's a movie starring share I mean there's
8108240	8113380	you know if this is for you or not like there's no surprise here target I would not recommend
8113380	8117320	Loki go see this unless maybe he wants to check out there are some scantily clad women
8117320	8121520	but they don't ever deliver on the actual man I know I say where's the real burlesque
8121520	8127720	with the pasties and yeah no they don't do anything it is kind of like it's it's watered
8127720	8131560	down burlesque a little bit but I but then but then there's that part of me it's like
8131560	8136540	but share is a fucking fierce fierce bitch and she steals every scene she's in every
8136540	8142400	scene share is an extended lady marmalade video yeah that's fair that's fair but with
8142400	8146440	share and she's made of awesome so and I know I know a lot of the listeners probably want
8146440	8149440	to hear this but we'll have girl talk here for a minute I will say the guy that plays
8149440	8154480	Christina Aguilera's love interest in the movie is smoking hot smoking hot he kind of
8154480	8159840	he reminded me of the previous of a young Cary Elwes but he's aged weird so yes yeah
8159840	8167840	yeah I saw Cary Elwes in the a preview for Saw 3D and I was like oh wow wow he's back
8167840	8172860	in that yeah he's he's and then it's good I don't really like to follow the Saw movies
8172860	8177480	from what I understand they bring him back as part of a flashback people who know people
8177480	8184760	who've all survived the games from prior but he didn't survive I don't know whatever chat
8184760	8192480	wants to know was it better or worse than showgirls on a scale of one to showgirl here's
8192480	8198640	the thing though I love showgirls because it's so bad it's good and it burlesque isn't
8198640	8203360	really like that I don't think burlesque was bad it was just it was like a movie from the
8203360	8207840	nineteen forties you know exactly what's going to happen the plot you see coming from a mile
8207840	8213960	away it's not really any surprises but if you're just going to you know have fun and
8213960	8218720	just not really think for a couple hours it's good for that I heard people complaining they
8218720	8224000	want it to be showgirls era hot mess no it's not that much of a gamer topic what about
8224000	8230360	burlesque the game well I'd like to see that on Xbox connect actually have to actually
8230360	8236080	they have to shake your titties and you know that somebody's going to come up with something
8236080	8242240	like because it's sort of connect thing specifically for that oh hey back to video games I do have
8242240	8248100	one more a actually funny enough this is about the boobs and connect so maybe they could
8248100	8254320	use this in a burlesque type game but the Xbox 360 is connect it can track the head
8254320	8259440	it can track the hands but now we can track the breasts that's right this is Dan Wilcox
8259440	8263920	actually hacked the connect to see if it could spot his chest and what happens is that the
8263920	8271100	computer is looking for his man boobs and draws a bra or pasties on top and music plays
8271100	8276920	when titties are detected so sure enough there's this little video called the connect titty
8276920	8292440	tracker and the guys moving back and forth and like it draws a little bra on his chest
8292440	8299280	that's a CBS needs I don't know why it's all skippy I don't know if that's the program
8299280	8311840	or what that's because the music so there goes I look for a person size blob and use
8311840	8318640	it centroid to approximate a search box wherein to detect two boobs so I don't know if it
8318640	8323640	would work on women yet but we haven't seen that video or at least it's not appropriate
8323640	8329000	to be on family websites I don't know but there you go the connect can now officially
8329000	8339880	track your movies so you are just giggling away too much rob like a little so much stupid
8339880	8347200	shit on tonight's show like really I love it all right we're gonna go ahead and open
8347200	8351720	up the skype line let's just take it from bad to worse let's open up the skype line

8357280	8360720	to give us a call orange launch radio all one word on skype or one eight seven seven

8367800	8371540	I'm worried because Bobby you know the man who does the show before us here at all games
8371540	8375480	radio by like I've got like no calls all night so I'm a little worried our phone may not
8375480	8378900	ring but we'll we'll see what happens low key do you have any last minute stories while
8378900	8386420	we wait for uh calls uh oh eight calls coming in how do you like that hi you're on orange
8386420	8391840	launch radio who's this hi uh this is spazzinator hi spazzinator did you call in to talk about
8391840	8401320	boobs uh well that wasn't my intention but sure why not they're always relevant uh what
8401320	8409360	did you call in to talk about tonight um well as I had mentioned on uh twitter uh and working
8409360	8416680	new and turning red uh earlier in the show um I was going to talk about uh that new voodoo
8416680	8421280	service over on uh playstation notebook oh yes tell us a little bit about voodoo because
8421280	8427400	I'm not very familiar with it what is uh what's up with voodoo um well I started to know it's
8427400	8435800	a relatively new service it I think it's uh started by either walmart or best buy or one
8435800	8443480	of those big you know retail chains it's uh basically they're equivalent to uh the playstation
8443480	8452920	network video store um you know you know you know basically you can uh rent uh or buy movies
8452920	8459760	uh from their service kind of like what you can do from playstation network uh and plus
8459760	8468880	it has um you know you know full twitter and facebook integration on that and and not only
8468880	8476200	that but um you know you know you get you know here's kind of a unusual you know interface
8476200	8484760	twitter at least unusual compared to say uh uh the xbox uh xbox video marketplace and
8484760	8493720	compared to uh playstation network where uh now it has uh a multi-page menu to it where
8493720	8499320	you know it'll give you a whole bunch of information regarding the movie like uh like a platform
8499320	8504240	oops sorry I'm on the website and it started a video I hate this fucking autoplay shit
8504240	8508640	sorry I was on the voodoo website trying to educate myself but it started an autoplay
8508640	8517280	video well basically it has a multi-page uh menu to it where it'll tell you you know all
8517280	8523120	about the movie who made it who's in it plot summary so on and so forth even though the
8523120	8530400	box art to uh the the movie if you know you know like what you would see on a dvd or blu-ray
8530400	8537000	whatever now the only you know there is a uh you know anything interfacing all that
8537000	8543940	I love the interface you know it's a whole lot better than you know the playstation network
8543940	8552400	and you know the market sauce service uh and plus you know with their videos you know you
8552400	8557080	can even get five point you know once around sound on the videos so okay so it has a very
8557080	8564240	pretty interface does it cost money to use it uh yeah it is basically you know uh you
8564240	8570680	know you pay actual dollars and cents to rent or you know rent or buy the movie just like
8570680	8580240	you would for uh blockbuster video or hollywood video or anywhere else uh you know unlike
8580240	8586600	where uh you know unlike netflix where you got like you know one flat fee rent everything
8586600	8591760	now you pay per movie on voodoo all right well you know what I find interesting voodoo
8591760	8596960	um I'm reading about it they were just recently bought by walmart so it's the walmart movie
8596960	8600760	company now although they're still called voodoo it's actually owned by walmart so I
8600760	8604800	hope they don't go in and edit movies like they do cds that get sold in the stores that
8604800	8612400	would be disappointing uh yeah and the thing is with the voodoo app over on places network
8612400	8617720	they actually give you the first rental free uh everything else after that you know you
8617720	8621520	have to pay for so does that mean everybody can go get one free movie just by like signing
8621520	8628760	up yep no all you gotta do is print like an email address well yeah everybody has an email
8628760	8635080	address they send all their spam to so that'll work yeah now the there's like a couple minor
8635080	8641520	downsides to it um well even now I should wait I gotta say I gotta say hold on this
8641520	8646840	is very interesting I'm sorry voodoo apparently uh at one point actually would rent adult
8646840	8652040	titles but on february 25th to comply with the policies of its parents company voodoo
8652040	8658440	discontinued operated sorry discontinued operating the avn after dark channel which had the adult
8658440	8665280	movies on it oh now see I it's a bummer they didn't keep that open because I was I've been
8665280	8669480	saying this for the longest time whoever brings us the porto first is going to win this video
8669480	8675800	on demand war so if uh voodoo had done it man nobody would even be talking about hulu
8675800	8684480	because voodoo has the titties yeah uh there's I you know despite all the things I do like
8684480	8689240	about the voodoo servers there's a couple things I don't like about and which are kind
8689240	8695540	of major issues uh first of all you can't like download any videos that you rent or
8695540	8702000	buy locally to your hard drive you have to stream it okay uh and combine that with the
8702000	8708360	fact that you have to be logged into playstation network while you're viewing the movies so
8708360	8713640	if god forbid you know for whatever reason your internet goes out or whatever basically
8713640	8724080	you're s o l uh and not uh not only that but I have um as a side note a really fast internet
8724080	8731120	connection roughly about 20 megabits per second and even with that and having every other
8731120	8739760	device turned off like my 360 and psp and so forth when I rented the high you know the
8739760	8746960	really high quality uh hd uh the expendables with 5.1 surround sound that the movie was
8746960	8754280	constantly stuttering trying to buffer and whatnot and you know you know that shouldn't
8754280	8760280	happen you know because I have a fast internet service and not only that but uh every it
8760280	8769320	seems like every minute half to two minutes uh you know it literally would stop streaming
8769320	8775080	out the gallery saying oh yeah we can't no there's some kind of a problem we you know
8775080	8779960	I can't stream this as a movie try back later all right so it sounds like there might still
8779960	8783840	be some uh network issues I gotta wrap up so we can get more calls but I kind of want
8783840	8788080	to get the quick bottom line what's like the one sentence bottom line on this is it worth
8788080	8792000	checking out and getting your free movie or you know what no there's still too many problems
8792000	8798880	right now if you can you know uh if you're willing to deal with a few uh headaches go
8798880	8806020	ahead and try it you know there's a free rental but you know I wouldn't actually pay money
8806020	8810600	out of pocket for it though all right there you have it spazzinator thanks for the review
8810600	8815600	on voodoo we're gonna uh let you guys get more calls all right have a good one all right
8815600	8820320	have a good one later all right it's a bummer he missed out on all the pornography but I
8820320	8826800	guess I guess that was the pre-playstation 3 era or something idk uh 1877 game olr if
8826800	8830960	you want to give us a call or our username on skype orange lounge radio all one word
8830960	8836440	um by the way some kind of like late breaking news here I guess I can go ahead and say this
8836440	8841160	it's not really a secret uh loki was successfully able to get a hold of the techno kitten adventure
8841160	8846360	guy so we're gonna um we're gonna see when he's available if he says he's available sundays
8846360	8852240	as soon as next week we'll try to get him that's astounding I'm so excited all right

8896840	8901480	little I come think 3d like it's a 3d item kale I don't have a 30 ddr room there's that
8901480	8905000	ddr room I've been talking on the chat room all night long okay what's the ddr room do
8905000	8910080	I actually get to play actual ddr or do I get to watch my avatar stomp on him you go
8910080	8915200	you go into the uh konami penthouse yes a penthouse because I guess konami thinks you're
8915200	8919320	like players or something and uh you go out there and there's a konami points and it's
8919320	8923000	integrated with facebook too your konami points will go beyond facebook if you download the
8923000	8929280	uh facebook leaderboard app I can spam all my friends via home yay just like a facebook
8929280	8934880	game but now you go out there and there's a dance floor of all these people with their
8934880	8939660	really messed up avatars guys dressed up as the playstation move dildo thing whatever
8939660	8944200	and uh you can go out there and every now and then there's a group dance off and then
8944200	8948780	a dance off item and it's actual ddr you play with like you know you press the buttons uh
8948780	8953000	up down left right on your d-pad I don't know if they have support for the pad phone could
8953000	8958520	confirm that for me when they have it and you do it to earn points it's pretty cool
8958520	8966480	but I have yet to do win a match because I uh I'm white well just because you recommended
8966480	8970360	it sir I will make it a point to check it out this week and see what's what's going

8981840	8987600	what am I trying to say you missed out on some thanksgiving event with chasing turkeys
8987600	8991600	could people dress up as turkeys because I remember one of their big events was the furry
8991600	8999680	event you chase the turkeys around and you could get a turkey costume I swear home is
8999680	9004600	like not even home doesn't even try to hide that it's catering to the furries it really
9004600	9009600	doesn't try to hide it at all well you know they actually have costumes now that you could
9009600	9017160	dress up as like a cat or a bulldog or stuff like that you know if you're in the home clubs
9017160	9022720	I could find like yes masters 4000 club I think the people that need to know that already
9022720	9032800	know it what can I do anything with the olr club now I don't I'm not sure I've uh I kind
9032800	9037920	of cancelled my join request because I uh I know we got full we got they can we can
9037920	9043960	only hold 25 people and by some miracle of god there's more than that but I'm not sure
9043960	9048680	oh if that's true then I'll go add more people hold on I got sent a video of ddr and playstation
9048680	9054720	home this looks fucking stupid it's just all these people moving around on a dance club
9054720	9063600	let me see if this gets interesting at all oh hold on I turn the audio and it has the
9063600	9069400	whole like chibi music oh a group dance-off is starting it looks like any douchebaggy club
9069400	9076520	on sunset oh it is you have to pay ten dollars to get in there and get stared at by bouncers
9076520	9084600	so wow it is kind of ddr and home I'll give it that that's okay it's just kind of interesting
9084600	9088120	nice little mini game you know something to do on home because there's really not much
9088120	9094120	to do on home why does the guy have like landing flares
9094120	9098280	I want to get in the costume and go dancing home like this why am I not seeing like a
9098280	9103520	single pedo bear on the dance floor that's what I want to know I saw some dude dressed
9103520	9110960	up as like mr muscle man up there like speedo and it was just like I was at a race from
9110960	9115520	yes exactly from what's that get wait this guy wait look at this guy over here hold on
9115520	9122480	this guy his pants are sagging hold on his pants are sagging so bad and he's not wearing
9122480	9128280	a shirt buy him a belt like if there isn't look at that there is no question if it's
9128280	9135360	boxers or briefs pants on the ground pants on the ground pants on the ground they're
9135360	9144720	ddring too pants on the ground so yeah anything else in home besides pants on the ground and
9144720	9153720	uh actually if your pants could go on the ground home would probably be a lot more popular
9153720	9157760	with a certain crowd midway which is like that one place in the fan of business where
9157760	9162920	is on the pier whatever that place is you can play like carnival games there and earn

9458800	9467520	the whole thing is that will be celebrity thing is uh a bit stupid as one can be expected
9467520	9477360	but the uh and the vampire thing is kind of like make almost in some way but uh what are
9477360	9485200	there well the kind of like good thing is that well we finally have penthouse and such
9485200	9494240	and apartments which is kind of good in one way if you're having a small sims family so
9494240	9498120	you can get a penthouse huh all right I'm liking where this is going do you get to get
9498120	9507000	a $15 gold suit no you no you can't not yet all right yeah do they do anything else besides
9507000	9514240	just like items are there new like game modes or new things experience oh um what are there
9514240	9528040	like uh um new skills no uh oh yeah the new uh like uh music stuff is kind of cool afterwards
9528040	9535760	once you get the hang of it even and one and one the annoying part about uh vampires that
9535760	9542200	really frustrate frustrates me like hell is that if you have vampire children they can
9542200	9550680	skill up in their skill that they're doing at the moment like instant really hold on
9550680	9557920	hold on be it hold on back up rewind press pause you can be a vampire now in the sims
9557920	9567600	yeah can you sparkle so you can well be all the that series do you get to sparkle is just
9567600	9575680	like twilight vampires no no it's not exactly like that oh thank god we do they don't sparkle
9575680	9581920	oh thank god so they're not mormon vampires yeah okay there are vampires but there aren't
9581920	9590960	aren't any werewolves so it's not the so it's not 100 twilight of sorts well that's that's
9590960	9595880	a relief thank god so you can you can do more like uh i don't know dark shadows as opposed
9595880	9604320	to because like dark shadows cool vampires twilight not cool vampires big difference
9604320	9615080	barnabas awesome r patinson not awesome anyhow oh yeah but one of the one of the ways kind
9615080	9621400	of like cool is that the um you have now uh you can actually build like you can build
9621400	9632960	your own swimming pool uh within uh on uh like send a few stories up of sorts say this
9632960	9638880	it seems before you couldn't actually build that build a swimming pool on your second
9638880	9646460	floor yes i could drown people on my roof and wait can you can you torture the vampires
9646460	9651840	by like putting them in sunlight or like you know putting a bunch of garlic in the kitchen
9651840	9658040	that's really like fun because uh if you because they don't because the vampires here don't
9658040	9666360	they can't uh be in the twilight be in the uh sun that often but if you do you will get
9666360	9676880	this oh can't do much and they uh like um oh how do you say though they uh they uh oh
9676880	9684800	they lose their hands so it's quite it's quite hilarious i haven't killed anyone yet doing
9684800	9690520	that torturing the sims is the whole reason to play sims you need to get on that yeah
9690520	9696740	all right well okay ripper let's let's try to wrap up here is is the sims 3 night time

9712360	9720240	or like actual clothing actual clothing in this one because sometimes nice clothing means
9720240	9725160	like you know all these new bras and panties for your sims to run around in all day long
9725160	9730960	or whatever it is you're into yeah yeah although you can skinny dip now nowadays yeah it's
