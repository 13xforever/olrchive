10458	12661	Sky, and Loki.
14203	20550	Tonight, November 28, 2010, BBC programming comes to video game consoles courtesy of PlayStation Network.
20870	22833	Could indie games soon feature the Kinect?
23233	26037	And another musician sues the makers of Guitar Hero.
31912	39374	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
39494	42915	It is episode number 391 for November 28th of 2010.
44355	51537	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52350	53050	I had balls.
53951	56992	Well, we want to go there this early in the show?
57133	57253	Fine.
57273	59374	They were meaty and tangy.
59494	61375	Oh, you're talking about meatballs, aren't you?
61395	62275	Yeah, barbecue meatballs.
62295	63836	Where did you get some barbecue meatballs?
63936	64576	From my husband.
65197	65817	I ate his balls.
65837	66718	So you got to eat his balls.
67058	68458	You wouldn't even let me lick his balls.
69019	69679	You can lick them.
70459	71080	There's some left.
71300	71780	Okay, good.
72000	72581	I'll lick them later.
72681	73721	He's got a lot of balls.
73801	74121	All right.
74301	78884	Anyway, let's also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
79424	79644	Hello.
80204	83725	Do I need to ask if you have any interest in licking Dan's balls?
84225	84905	No, I'm quite full.
84945	87625	I'm eating, uh, was it garlic parmesan twists?
87765	89546	Ah, you're downing the sticks over there, I see.
89626	90586	So, no interest in the balls.
90606	90946	That's fine.
91706	93746	They're twists, okay, not sticks.
93806	95327	How is your parmesan twists?
95887	96607	They're okay.
96707	101948	They were late, though, because I got, I, they said 15 to 20 minutes.
102048	103248	Got there 30 minutes later.
103688	105888	It should have been done by now.
106269	108809	I get there and they're like, oh yeah, we forgot to put them in the oven.
109329	109889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
134395	134755	Yeah.
134795	134996	Cool.
135856	144123	Alright, always present with us is the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Going to Breakman in our chat room starts us off tonight.
144604	147766	Every gamer has a voice, just please don't embarrass the rest of us.
147886	149868	I think that sums it up very well, actually.
149948	150689	Thank you, Breakman.
151389	153030	We do have another guest here in studio.
153070	155371	We are very excited to have her on the show.
155471	158112	She's a good friend of DarkSakura.
158252	160674	She's known for a very long time and I love her to bits too.
161194	164916	And Loki, I don't think they ever really hang out, but they'd probably be besties if they did.
165236	166977	Say hello to Marissa.
167397	167757	How are you?
167817	168397	Hi, kiddies.
168738	169138	How are you?
169158	169778	I'm good.
169798	170178	How are you?
170378	170739	Good.
171039	173560	And do you have like a nickname that you use that we should call you?
173840	178566	Well, I always go in by Marissa Con Gusto, but my boyfriend prefers to call me Marissa Con Busto.
179187	179667	That's right.
179928	186736	Here's the thing, and it's a bummer we don't have the webcam anymore, but Marissa has big boobs.
187337	189219	Oh my god, they're so big.
189800	190500	They're awesome.
191121	195785	So, but we love, we love, she's, and she also has a big brain, everybody, to go with it.
195806	196106	Thank you.
196146	198128	So don't just, don't just stare.
198288	200890	The, uh, the extra boobs are to hold extra brains.
201130	201971	That's right.
202111	202972	Exactly.
203673	206576	Um, and do you, do you even play video games or you're just kind of here for the lols?
208257	218065	Both, you know, actually I listen every week and I've always dated people that are really into games, but I'm kind of an old school gamer and I'm just going to wait for Eternity for another King's Quest to come out and Thief is never going to come out.
218085	218946	I don't care what they say.
219866	227152	Okay, you can stay because retro game, especially if you're going to go straight to King's Quest, which is something like the Holy Grail of PC games.
227793	235159	And, you know, we've actually had a lot of talk about the, and you may not even know this is out here, the fan-made King's Quest, the silver lining.
235179	235739	I've heard about that.
236059	239220	Yeah, it's like totally free, and I think they're on like the second episode now.
239360	245721	And Roberta Williams, even though I think she lives out in the woods in a fort now and has totally disavowed all the gaming industry.
246782	247302	The fort?
248522	250582	That might be her fort, actually, out there in the wilderness.
250982	253963	All I know is that she wants nothing to do with the gaming industry in this day and age.
255043	258984	But she actually kind of gave it a blessing without giving it her blessing.
259064	260545	Like, legally, she can't.
260825	261805	It's basically like...
262265	266228	Hey, I'm not going to make any more of that series until I need more money.
266329	267590	Kind of like how J.K.
267630	275236	Rowling's, I'm not going to make any more books, but maybe I could revisit the world at some point.
275696	277658	When I start running out of money, of course.
277958	287187	I love adventure games, and that's always been my thing, but there was all this hype about Siberia coming out, and that's like, to sit like no one ever boldly sat before.
287207	294213	I bet you would like some of the stuff that Telltale does, because they're trying to make that live on with the whole Sam & Max games.
294233	296315	They've got the Back to the Future games coming out soon.
296335	298337	I bet you that type of stuff would be right up their alley.
298637	301600	We need to get you and Seg here on the same night, because he works there, and he could...
302020	305122	He could sell you much better than I could.
305462	307683	Anyhow, I just have to go to the chat room.
307703	313027	I just want to give you a taste at the chatters.
313047	314167	I'm not even going to read the names here.
314207	314587	Here we go.
314908	315268	You ready?
316048	316889	Let's see.
317949	320211	Actually, I will say Jessica Harper said, bigger than mine.
321325	322166	Possibly.
322626	323126	I think so.
323366	326088	I think you might both have to whip them out and we'll see.
326789	329491	Whoever wins this contest doesn't actually win.
329511	330732	You know what I mean?
330852	332093	But here's some of the other comments.
333274	334034	Awesomely big.
334755	335395	Big boobs.
335735	336496	The mighty rack.
336776	338858	Take a photo and post it in the OLR gallery.
339238	340058	OMG boobs.
340399	341619	Her boobs have brains in them.
341960	343040	Everybody likes boobs.
343481	343901	Boobs.
344041	344502	Balls.
345844	347631	That's what this show's turned into tonight.
348092	349919	Pics of tits or get the fuck out.
350501	351324	That was from a girl.
354015	362201	My boyfriend tells me tits are good for us, so it's okay.
362341	366764	Is it weird that I'm the one that's keeping the show grounded at this point?
367084	369886	Is that strange to you?
370226	375110	Clearly there was some type of crack cocaine in our turkey for the Thanksgiving holiday.
375590	377352	I hope you all had a pleasant Thanksgiving.
377832	381014	I hope you didn't get in a car wreck or anything.
381055	382916	But if you're listening to the show, you must be fine.
382976	386018	So congratulations, and I hope you had a wonderful... He's not a girl.
387139	387520	No, I know.
388240	390622	The names were all running together, and I read it to somebody else.
390662	390922	Sorry.
391823	392864	It's live radio.
392924	395126	I don't always do well at it.
395787	396948	Even though it's only been, what, nine years?
397328	400451	So anyway, Marissa's going to join us tonight and lol with us.
400831	403073	And Shirley, if you have any input, you just jump right in there.
403433	405976	And you will have no problem jumping right in there.
407077	410400	We might play a game later, too, in Part B. So that'll be fun.
410680	412161	We'll get the chatters involved.
412261	414924	It's called Guess Marissa's Cup Size.
415104	415584	Oh, stop.
416385	417246	That would be a hard one.
417666	431035	We don't want to give Marissa a complex or make people think it's only about her boobs because actually you are a musician, correct?
431216	431436	Yes.
432116	434118	And what type of music do you do?
435404	440768	I do a neo-folk pop thing, but as most professionals... Neo-folk pop?
440968	442089	Yeah.
443049	447152	Acoustic is probably the better word, because you say folky, and people think like Peter, Paul, and Mary, you know?
447332	449193	So like, Jewel, do you yodel?
449814	451675	Um, well, uh, no.
452375	452716	Okay.
453216	454697	Because if you said yes, I was going to make you do it.
454717	458559	Well, I think, you know, most musicians nowadays specialize in being broke, so that's my...
462105	464129	You are actually the definition of starving L.A.
464149	464490	artist.
465071	465993	What's that old joke?
466654	468458	What do you call a musician without a girlfriend?
468939	469379	Homeless.
472921	473221	DarkSakura.com
500327	521562	well we played some rock band of the Beatles and three variety and Marissa belted out a good one and some Star Trek online a lot of games on my phone that's about it
522662	523043	All right.
523183	525885	You look amused, like you're about to laugh about something.
525965	529709	It's just chat and boobs, and the show amuses me.
529789	531070	It's okay to laugh.
531090	532732	I am wearing my Silent Hill shirt, though.
532752	533312	I'm very happy.
533432	533813	Yes, you are.
533833	535794	Because it's cold, and I can wear my Silent Hill shirt.
537116	538197	At least it's not foggy.
538257	539438	Then that might be the right kind of atmosphere.
539478	540178	It was the other day.
540319	540599	Was it?
540939	541500	Yes, it was.
541560	542821	It was quite foggy last night.
543325	544326	All right, well, let's go to Loki.
544426	545226	How was your gaming week?
545686	546807	Anything new or exciting?
547327	548668	No, unfortunately not.
549368	556052	It really is just Grand Theft Auto this week and Stick Wars on my iPod.
556772	557473	That was about it.
557513	558013	I mean, really.
558573	559454	What is Stick Wars?
559994	564237	Stick Wars, remember that game Defender Castle where you take little stick figures and throw them into the air?
564437	565757	You told me a little bit about this last week.
565837	568039	It's basically like a knockoff of that.
568339	571000	And then, so I've been playing it forever now.
571521	571701	And...
573618	574078	Thanks for watching!
590836	592537	Well, it sounds like you didn't have much of a holiday.
592597	595499	You had more of a working past few days.
595800	600643	And fixed my sister's computer because she got like 65 different things of spyware on there.
600883	602305	That takes talent.
603626	606448	How many porn sites does one have to visit to get all of that?
607248	608149	Spyware install.
608169	609049	I just reinstalled Windows.
609450	611211	It's my old laptop that I used to bring in.
611651	616194	Thankfully, it, you know, because I was like, well, I hate the fact that this has a super recovery partition.
616554	634146	I love the fact that that has a stupid recovery partition because all it is, ah, fuck it, I don't care, backup, and it'll just erase everything out of there, reinstall Windows with all the stuff that was on there from when I got it, and any files that were important get backed up into a folder, delete everything else, and we're good.
634626	636588	So I can reinstall Windows, like, super quick.
637528	638229	It's awesome.
640831	643653	But yeah, that's pretty much all I was doing.
643673	645875	I was hoping to play some Kinect stuff.
646095	646996	Never got around to that.
647016	650358	In fact, can't now because I moved the coffee table to put the tree in.
651219	653701	So I don't have room anymore to play Kinect in my living room.
654742	659305	I notice a lot of people complaining about the amount of space that Kinect requires.
659366	661787	That for a lot of people, it actually isn't practical.
662308	664830	I've noticed that kind of buzz around the internet lately.
664870	666351	A lot of people complaining about the space you need.
666451	667752	Well, it's just that coffee table.
667792	668733	I don't like it anymore.
669734	671775	It's a coffee table I got from my grandparents.
672916	673637	I mean, it's old.
674357	675779	And it's really cumbersome.
675819	683185	I'm thinking of getting two Ottomans instead and just sitting them next to each other for a coffee table.
684025	686347	That way we can use them as seating as well if we need to.
686948	688429	And we can move them out of the way a lot easier.
690210	692892	It's just that set of furniture is just really old.
694053	694153	Um...
695094	695675	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
714747	720149	Yes, our work, they do these parties once a month or whatever at the end of each month.
721309	725590	So last week was technically the end of the month because we weren't there this week.
725710	727070	And you rode a mechanical bull.
727411	727511	Yes.
727531	730031	This is sounding more like a drunken sorority party than... No.
730351	730631	Okay.
730811	734272	It was funny because I wanted to see, you know, I wanted to do it better than everybody else.
734292	734893	Sure, of course.
735233	736273	And how long did you last?
736713	738054	I did really well, actually.
738094	747102	In fact, I was taunting the guy that was operating it, and so he did it, you know, really difficult ride, and I kicked the crap out of it, so it was fun.
747182	748904	So you just have to hold on and...
750475	750915	Pretty much.
752396	753197	It was pretty easy.
754938	759141	No, but other than that, just a lot more Dance Central.
759201	761163	Actually, I did play a little bit of Dance Central during work.
762344	763464	Just some of the few songs on there.
763685	769769	I'm thinking of getting some download content, but I'm going to have to wait until I upgrade certain systems.
769789	776013	You do know there are very, very few people out there listening to the show or anywhere that can say, I played Dance Central at work.
778295	779496	Well, on my break, you know.
779727	807912	no I know but still this is funny and of course still working on editing Grand Theft Auto stuff and then yesterday I was messing with it's not even really a game well I consider it a game because I'm getting free money for exploiting a website so that was kind of a game it's this website appredeem.com you download free apps paid apps or if you have a jailbroken phone free apps and they give you money
809719	810539	Interesting.
810619	812400	Like straight into your PayPal account.
812440	815181	This sounds like one of those free iPod schemes.
815541	816901	It's not a scheme though, but here's the thing.
816921	831086	I mean, I guess they're trying to entice you to buy the apps, but if you really don't want to, you just put in your PayPal account, the email that you use for your PayPal account, and you can just go download the free apps and you get like $1.50 for free.
832026	832246	Weird.
832547	835207	So you don't even have to buy any of the paid apps.
835227	836168	Just download the free ones.
836668	836828	Hmm.
837168	838510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
853346	861228	See, if I was trying to exploit everything, I would give out a link or something that would have some sort of referral thing or something where I'd get credit for it, but I don't care.
862208	875171	I'm just saying, though, that all you do is download these apps, you go into them for like a second, go back to the website, you get credit for it, delete the app, you're done.
875451	877611	I like this comment in our chatroom.
877671	880352	Actdeft says, a week later, my PayPal account got hacked.
882205	885867	I don't think they can hack your PayPal account by just giving them an email address.
886728	887548	Or use a different one.
888088	888669	Yeah, exactly.
888789	897154	I didn't realize they were going to use that email address as a PayPal account, so I had to actually create a second PayPal account for the email address I gave them.
898294	898654	Whatever.
899635	901176	I'll just send it to my original PayPal account.
901696	902997	Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
903831	904091	That's it.
904411	904671	Alright.
904952	909154	Marissa, I don't know if you've been playing any games recently, but I thought I'd ask if there's anything.
909234	912155	I know you have one of those fancy Windows phones now or something.
912655	912996	I don't know.
913056	914216	Maybe you've been playing games on that.
914616	916677	You don't put the word fancy and Windows phone together.
917118	918518	Well, they have this new thing.
919259	920699	Maybe it's like the new Windows phone.
920720	925782	They're really pushing, but it's this whole Xbox Live integration and it's trying to compete with the iPhone.
926162	926522	Excuse me.
926542	932465	I have a Touch Pro 2 and nobody cares anything for it.
932605	933366	It's Sprint, but
933746	937048	I only pay, you know, $35 a month, so I'll deal with it.
937108	946414	But I've, I don't know, I've heard just within the community, because I was looking, you know, like I'm ineligible for any upgrades, even though the hardware is capable of it, which stinks.
946514	950536	But HTC makes a good phone, so at least I know that everything else is solid.
950876	953718	And I lost my rock band virginity to Jamie.
954078	954418	Nice.
954518	954738	So...
955979	957961	So you actually did some of the singing in the game?
957981	966067	I did the singing and I played guitar and bass and I guess I have to go back and now tell my musician friends who are always bitching about it that they appreciate it.
966107	977016	This is where I wanted to go with this because a lot of musicians, I'm glad you brought this up, because a lot of musicians like to razz on rock band because it's not really playing an instrument and it's like dumbing down music.
977537	982801	Did you feel that way or were you like, no, this is just fun and nothing else?
983168	983968	Thank you for watching!
998675	999316	Thanks for watching!
1016994	1027342	I don't know if you got to see any of this, but probably not because I don't think the actual guitars are out or I don't think Jamie has them, but there's actually these pro modes now in Rock Band where you can learn to play the real instrument.
1027382	1033646	I've been doing it for keyboard, which is kind of fun because I used to play keyboard back when I was like 12, so it's kind of fun to get back into that.
1033826	1042488	And you know, if you wait long enough, even though it is kind of an inferior game, according to reviews, I'm sure Power Geek will drop in price really quickly.
1042508	1045329	And it has an electric guitar with it, too.
1045349	1046069	That's what I saw.
1046169	1054851	Actually, the thing that ticked me off about that, though, I mean, I know there's the gaming part of it, but you could get a really nice starter guitar for the price of that piece of crap.
1054911	1055332	I'm sorry.
1055352	1055952	It's all right.
1056952	1058153	We're honest here at OLR.
1058293	1061054	Just like for the, you know, if you want to play the game, that's fine.
1061094	1063775	If you want to play and even use that to learn, that's fine too.
1063835	1067136	But it's way overpriced considering you can go get a nice squire.
1067996	1072858	I think for some people, though, it's really that interactivity, being able to kind of interact and get that.
1073258	1075479	We're a very instant gratification society, right?
1075820	1079741	So to pick up a guitar and just kind of strum sometimes isn't because you're not sure if you're doing it right.
1079761	1081382	Unless you're playing Green Day songs, then who cares?
1082287	1085629	What I think that we should do... Did you know there's a whole rock band that's just Green Day?
1085709	1086469	I don't know how you can do that.
1086489	1087269	It's only three chords.
1087469	1088610	Well, because there's five buttons.
1088630	1089230	So it works.
1089310	1092612	I'm sorry, man.
1092632	1093212	No, no.
1093852	1098154	What they need to do is just have another contest or something, like a power gig contest.
1098775	1101996	Once those things get cheap enough, you just smash the guitar at the end of each song.
1103197	1103737	It's fun.
1104637	1107779	It's like, yeah, this game sucks, but that felt good.
1109557	1110098	Thanks for watching!
1129455	1129755	Nice.
1131116	1131717	Will it blend?
1132117	1132477	All right.
1133118	1133698	So good.
1133718	1135680	I'm glad the musician got to try some rock bands.
1135720	1137701	So will you try it again at some point?
1137721	1138822	Oh, it was so much fun.
1138942	1139443	It really was.
1139643	1139903	Awesome.
1140123	1140363	Awesome.
1140483	1141885	The harmony feature is really neat, too.
1142445	1147509	Yeah, the harmony feature is kind of cool because it's hard for some people to hear the harmony, I think.
1148069	1150611	And that takes a little while to kind of train your ears to be able to hear that.
1150651	1151512	So kind of to...
1151792	1152493	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1171910	1174312	I have found some new bands through Rock Band.
1175352	1178954	There's a song I really like in Rock Band 3, Last Dance.
1179174	1181796	And I'd never heard, I think the band's like the Ravenettes or something.
1181816	1182676	I'd never heard of them before.
1183036	1183757	But I really like the song.
1183777	1184517	I checked out their CD.
1184797	1185358	It's kind of cool.
1185478	1186638	So there you go.
1186658	1187499	All right.
1187879	1188480	My Gaming Week.
1188520	1189100	I actually played...
1189820	1218052	A few different games this week And a lot of that is thanks to the Steam sale But I'll get to that in a minute I did touch back on some of the games I played last week Now last week I'd only played demos But this week I did just jump in And I bought the full version of Super Meat Boy Which is, it's pretty great I gotta say, it's actually I would go so far as to say It's one of the best arcade games That is out there right now, period Like, at all And I would have never thought that this game would fall in that category But I love the kind of like
1218832	1224717	I want to say it's almost like a WarioWare-ish game, but Mario-style.
1224737	1230581	What I mean by that is that a lot of the levels in the game should take you no more than 30 seconds to beat.
1231302	1233904	And most of them are in the 15-20 second range.
1234224	1239068	So it's really about learning the exact right pattern to beat a level.
1239088	1241290	It's like playing an old Mega Man game or something, I don't know.
1242170	1249835	I'm just having a lot of fun getting extraordinarily frustrated playing Super Meat Boy when I'm like two seconds away from beating a level and just screwing it up.
1250375	1262182	And I gotta tell you, Alan was watching me play and he wants to watch me play just to laugh at me getting so frustrated when I get so close to beating a level and then I like, oops, fall in the gear and get Super Meat Boy all chopped up or whatever.
1262603	1265524	So yeah, I actually think Super Meat Boy is amazing.
1265925	1271008	My only, I guess, complaint is that I think in some ways it's almost too hard to
1271548	1276649	Like, there's a lot of people that are going to buy Super Meat Boy that are never going to get past the second level.
1278050	1279670	And it's kind of unfortunate.
1279710	1283351	But if you keep with it, I mean, that can also be the big reward with it.
1283371	1285692	Did you get to check out the internet?
1286192	1287092	No, I haven't got there yet.
1287112	1290273	I don't know if that's towards the end or what, but I'm only on like the third level.
1290353	1292473	It's taken me a long time to get there too.
1292613	1294834	I mean, it's been quite a bit of gaming time.
1295414	1322902	so uh I will keep trying to get there I love the warp zones that take you to the retro style levels I thought that was amazing and it has like retro music and the soundtrack is astounding I'm gonna um for the live listeners I'll do some of the soundtrack for break tonight but the soundtrack is astounding it is great and it's all like indie stuff I think the guy who did the soundtrack's not really done any other games before so it's um it's great there's really only one one Xbox Live Arcade game I'm waiting for um
1324802	1329465	and unfortunately, I don't know when it's coming out, the Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.
1330146	1330666	Never heard of that.
1331086	1332367	You gotta watch the video for it.
1332467	1332747	Okay.
1333188	1333828	It's awesome.
1333848	1334588	Should I look it up right now?
1334628	1334949	Yeah.
1334989	1335309	What is it?
1335329	1337250	It's got an awesome song that goes with it.
1337730	1342674	It's, I don't even know, it's not really a shooter, but you play it like a UFO.
1343074	1344955	It's this guy, he's a really good artist.
1345275	1350318	Alrighty, I'm loading up Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet debut trailer.
1350339	1351519	I'm gonna jump in the middle here though.
1351920	1354021	Awesome song goes along with it.
1357150	1358510	I'm not hearing... Oh, because I can't play.
1359971	1362791	Oh, this kind of has that... What's that game?
1362851	1363252	Limbo?
1363272	1365792	What the hell is that game?
1365872	1367033	I can't think of the name.
1367073	1368773	Not Braid, but the other artsy one.
1375435	1378235	Now it's looking like an anime or something.
1378656	1379676	Planets collide!
1382151	1384271	No, like when they get down to the actual gameplay.
1384291	1386252	Well, that's... It's a little like UFOs flying.
1386272	1388052	This is part of the game where the UFOs fly?
1388092	1389553	Yeah, that's all part of the game.
1389573	1390753	What is this, an arcade release?
1390953	1394314	Yeah, Xbox Live Arcade and PC.
1394434	1399435	Arcade games are getting very interesting.
1399515	1405536	It's almost like you're like this little UFO and you're flying through different levels and dodging obstacles.
1406156	1407196	Wow, something that's really interesting.
1407236	1407636	Okay.
1407897	1409297	Yeah, the art style is pretty rad on this.
1409417	1409877	I like that.
1418990	1420031	That does look pretty cool.
1420051	1420451	I like that.
1420572	1424817	Kind of like a half-shooter, half... Almost like the same concept as Super Meat Boy.
1424857	1427059	You're trying to get through a level, get through these tricky ways.
1427340	1428761	I'm going to paste the link there in chat.
1428821	1431845	Sorry, folks listening on podcasts, but you won't be able to get that link.
1431865	1434228	But just look for Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.
1436010	1436390	Interesting.
1437351	1437612	Alright.
1438693	1443258	Also, I played more Pac-Man Championship Edition Deluxe, which I love.
1443358	1449704	There's very, very satisfying rewards when you gobble up a train of 30 ghosts and get the high score.
1450465	1451506	Again, the music's great.
1451546	1453468	Kind of the same stuff I was saying last week.
1453609	1455991	Buying the retail version didn't really change my opinions there.
1456011	1458514	I still think it's a worthy upgrade if you like the last one.
1460375	1463656	New games I played this week, thanks to Steam and some of the sales going on there.
1463756	1481164	I did finally play Poker Night at the Inventory, because that finally came out, which is the Texas Hold'em poker game that features some of the characters that you see in various Telltale games, and Valve, really, because Heavy from Team Fortress is in there, Tycho is in there, and Strong Bad.
1482905	1483946	It's a Texas Hold'em game.
1485226	1508597	and uh it's it's really kind of that's it it's really a no frills poker game there's not a whole lot of modes there is not a multiplayer so you might be wondering well then why would i bother with this game well a it's five dollars right i think it's only five dollars to get this game and uh ten and most i think it's only five though and there was a lot of sales going on during the pre-order i think i paid five for it like two months ago
1508911	1509712	Thank you for watching!
1528066	1531910	The rest, like the heavy and the max, I can kind of give and take.
1531970	1534672	But yeah, I loved Strong Bad.
1535212	1536854	Tycho's all right, but I don't know.
1536894	1540497	There's something about him where he comes off as a real smug asshole in the game.
1540517	1541538	That's exactly his character.
1544700	1545660	Yes, but I don't know.
1545680	1551321	When I read Penny Arcade, I don't quite get it as strong as I get it in the Poker Night game.
1551341	1552622	Maybe even better if it was Gabe.
1553242	1554522	But it was fine.
1554662	1555022	It's fine.
1555322	1561303	I mean, for a $5 poker game, I more look at it as you're buying laughs.
1561824	1565324	If you want an actual poker game, this is not the game to get.
1565744	1566104	It's not.
1566404	1568565	It's a very no-frills, low thing.
1568985	1569385	DarkSakura.com
1588857	1590738	But don't expect a lot of modes and extra stuff.
1590978	1596401	Unless there's unlockable things that I haven't found yet, which I wouldn't doubt at all, actually.
1597082	1603125	I wouldn't doubt at all that there'd be some hidden shit in there that I just haven't found yet, and that's fine.
1603945	1605606	I actually bought the game.
1605666	1611109	I didn't get a review copy that has the little sheet that tells you how to get all the unlocks that a lot of publishers do.
1612790	1619093	Also, another game that I got, Reketeer, an item shop's tale, I think was the name of the game.
1622455	1626577	It's a PC version of a game that looks like it was done on the PlayStation 1.
1627137	1632640	And I don't know if it was translated or what the deal is, but Alan summed it up perfectly.
1632960	1635841	He was looking at it going, this game is so weeaboo.
1636641	1637842	And that's really what it is.
1637942	1638883	It's just this very...
1640043	1653817	Chibi, Teehee, I'm playing a dumb girl that's opening an item shop and I have this little fairy that helps navigate me through the complex item shop stuff and we go to the village and find a hero to take us through the dungeons.
1653857	1655439	It's just like, oh my god, I'm gonna barf.
1655559	1657982	This is so just stupid.
1658362	1658642	But...
1659523	1661264	I will say one thing I liked about it.
1661284	1664965	Well, A, I bought it in a pack of like five games for five bucks.
1665045	1668807	So like considering I paid a whole dollar for Reketeer, it's hard to complain.
1669267	1678150	But B, I actually really like the idea of the game because the idea of the game is that you're not the hero.
1678710	1682232	You run the item shop in a hero's game.
1683132	1683913	It's on my wish list.
1684153	1689256	Which is kind of, oh, it's a bummer you didn't sign in a couple days ago and it was on sale for like five bucks.
1689276	1690657	I've been too busy having fun with Marissa.
1691017	1691438	Oh, fine.
1691678	1692578	I guess that's fair enough.
1693739	1696561	Having pillow fights and talking about boobies.
1697041	1697281	All right.
1698802	1702886	So yeah, Reketeer, I honestly would not pay more than $5 for this game.
1702906	1706289	And even then, it's like, you might want to check out a demo first and see if it's really for you.
1706770	1710653	But some of the like, okay, I didn't even really describe the game.
1710693	1712034	I'm all over the place tonight, guys.
1712054	1712254	Sorry.
1713335	1714737	You run an item shop.
1715337	1736759	and so you can buy and sell things you can buy things from people to come in or you can sell things that you find in dungeons and in order to go into a dungeon you hire a hero to go into the dungeon for you and I don't know they somehow write this into the very chibi story that the item shop girl is protected and she can't get hit by the monsters but the hero can
1737299	1737819	DarkSakura.com
1765567	1770491	I'm looking in our chatroom at chat.orangeentredo.com and some of the folks talking about Poker Night at the Inventory.
1771211	1773833	Deathwishing says, Sky, there's Team Fortress 2 hats.
1774193	1777255	Yes, I have heard that there are unlocks for other games in it.
1777615	1778276	I did miss that.
1778316	1779377	So yeah, that's correct.
1779897	1782099	You can unlock some items that show up in other games.
1782519	1783059	It's pretty cool.
1784600	1786041	Breakman in chat says, What the fuck?
1786081	1788023	Sky buys his games after heavily drinking?
1788603	1791045	I don't think I was drinking heavily when I bought that game, actually.
1791145	1791825	So there you go.
1793226	1804618	Alright, anyhow, yeah, so Reketeer is, if you like those like chibi import PlayStation 1 games, then this is right up your alley, but if you're looking for like a serious RPG, don't bother.
1804918	1805940	But I like the concept.
1806360	1812567	I like that idea that you're not always the hero, that sometimes you're the girl running the item shop who's kind of a ditz.
1813287	1813427	Fun.
1814208	1815970	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1834068	1836849	That's why we had to get Marissa up here this time.
1838149	1840909	But we will still be bringing you much OLR through the rest of the year.
1841089	1846030	If you like the show, and we hope you do, please consider adding us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1846330	1847411	We're also on Facebook.
1847451	1849791	You can like us at Orange Lounge Radio.
1849831	1851291	Just search for that and we should come right up.
1852472	1854192	We always want more fans on Facebook.
1854312	1860173	It helps us spread the word about our show because we don't have big budgets of advertising dollars or any of that good stuff.
1860593	1861354	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1886050	1892833	We haven't reported on PSP firmware updates in a while, probably because a lot of people have kind of written off the PSP.
1892974	1908921	But anyways, there is a firmware update, 6.35, and it adds Curiosity, which I guess is a new music streaming service called Music Unlimited, which I guess is powered by Curiosity.
1909561	1910782	X-Radar GPS Mapping Software
1932430	1936294	I feel like this is something that's been in there a while, or maybe it's like a newer technology, I don't know.
1936314	1955892	Well, they've had a GPS add-on for a long time, and I want to say that I believe all the other regions have support for it, but they just never sold it over here, which is too bad, because that'd be pretty awesome to have GPS on, you know, a PSP might make it kind of worth it, but at this point I think they've just given up on it.
1956833	1956933	Um...
1958971	1968878	And I'm also assuming that there's some sort of fixes for software hacks and stuff like that in there because that's always something that they kind of do.
1969839	1972100	But that is available, I believe, now.
1972781	1974362	So, neat.
1976476	1985198	It's kind of late, if you ask me, though, to add a music service to the PSP, considering, I mean, it's almost at the end of its life cycle.
1986019	1990400	Or are you saying that just because we've had all this talk about PSP 2 news lately?
1990440	1991860	It's going to be announced next year.
1991880	1992660	I mean, come on.
1992680	1994621	Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's coming out next year.
1994641	1997002	Oh, it's coming out, I bet you, by holiday next year.
1997102	1999202	Well, that's still one year away from today.
1999282	2000983	That's still at the end of its life cycle.
2001083	2005104	I mean, what big games have they announced for the PSP that haven't come out yet?
2005484	2009226	Well, they're kind of still being powered by some of the big titles that came out.
2009266	2013648	Like, that Kingdom Hearts game is pretty beautiful, if you kind of see it.
2013829	2014909	Yeah, but, I mean, come on.
2015169	2021753	Like, the only things that they had come out in November that were worthwhile, I guess, the new God of War game goes to Sparta, which...
2023274	2023934	I mean, come on.
2025215	2029619	How many prequel games to the God of War series do we really need?
2030279	2039247	And then they did have another Ghost Recon game come out on the PSP, but there's not a lot of other things that are available for the PSP that are kind of worthwhile.
2039847	2041228	It's really slowing down.
2044308	2045449	I don't really know.
2046750	2049872	I'm just assuming it's going to be kind of going away at some point very soon.
2050993	2058258	Breakman in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we tape live on this Sunday evening asks, I thought they were going to heavily market the PSP this year.
2058578	2060579	Didn't they get a kid to be the face of the PSP?
2060719	2062621	I haven't seen a PSP commercial in a long time.
2063681	2066103	Yeah, thank God because he's so fucking annoying.
2066294	2068976	Well, is that maybe because their big focus this year has been on the move?
2069056	2070878	That they really want to sell the PlayStation Move?
2070918	2083608	They are really trying to focus on marketing the PSP, but the stuff that they're focusing on, it's just like catalog titles and, you know, just what small releases that they have coming out.
2083628	2087071	I mean, what few, or I shouldn't say small, what few releases they have coming out.
2087391	2090634	I mean, their big marketing campaign is, hey, look, we got these old games that are $10 now.
2092535	2094656	I mean, that's great, I guess.
2094776	2096916	You know, these games that have been out for a long time.
2097336	2100397	I mean, really, do we need to be marketing Mod Nation Racers still?
2100657	2102238	I mean, that game came out six months ago.
2103118	2107800	Akuma JP in our chatroom says, Monster Hunter 3rd is big here.
2107860	2109340	He lives over in Japan, so...
2109720	2110441	Thanks for watching!
2125310	2126211	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2148762	2153486	DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom says, I'm still wondering when Kingdom Hearts 3 itself will come out.
2153926	2157248	I believe a lot of that is tied to Final Fantasy XIII Versus.
2157689	2160991	If I remember right, it's the same team that usually does the Kingdom Hearts games.
2161952	2169237	Part of the reason Kingdom Hearts 3 has been so unheard of is because Final Fantasy XIII Versus has taken so long.
2169598	2173000	Next Kingdom Hearts game is also going to be on DS, recoded, so...
2174847	2176828	Well, then there's the 3DS title, too.
2176868	2177609	They've got in the works, right?
2177629	2179610	Yes, there is a 3DS title in the works as well.
2181311	2187654	I mean, just once the 3DS comes out, I think it's going to be just the final blow for the PSP until they announce the PSP 2.
2187774	2189976	Then that might pick things up.
2190236	2192757	Especially with these rumors that it might be the phone as well.
2192857	2194899	I think it's going to be something separate.
2195019	2197320	I don't think it's going to be a phone integrated into it.
2197700	2206066	I can see it's something like the iPod Touch or something where it has many of the features of the phone minus the phone, you know, like the whole marketplace and stuff.
2206086	2209749	They're probably going to try to emulate a lot of that stuff, but I don't know.
2212176	2220507	I guess if you have a PSP, you know, neat that they have another update, which will probably be cracked in a few days anyways.
2222050	2225995	But, I mean, there's not a lot of titles on the horizon for you guys, unfortunately.
2226816	2227357	But hey, just...
2227737	2238844	Wait, don't be tempted by some of these Black Friday sales, which I did see they had one as a PSP Go for $150 and it came with three games, including LittleBigPlanet and stuff like that.
2239224	2240945	So that's kind of cool.
2241685	2245528	But once again, they're just trying to soccer you in so they can clear out inventory.
2246428	2249550	And really, do you want a PSP Go when it's at the end of its life cycle?
2249750	2250470	See, here's the thing, though.
2250510	2253331	SolarFlare in our chatroom says, I never regret getting my PSP.
2253531	2265613	And I still think if you don't have a PSP after all this time still, I still think there's a great back catalog of games that are getting cheaper by the day as the console is nearing the end of its life cycle.
2265733	2267553	I think it's definitely worth looking to go get.
2267854	2275155	And let's not forget, I've always said, and I think you guys agree, that the PSP's biggest strength is not necessarily its games library, although that's gotten a lot better.
2275515	2291739	But the fact that the PSP also plays MP3s, does the movies, does the internets, does... That's the problem, though, with the PSP, though, is all that stuff, even nowadays, with the new, like, technology that's out there, with the new smartphones and everything, it's getting really weak.
2291959	2300201	That's a weak argument now, because before, it was like, hey, yeah, I can, you know, browse the web, and, yeah, the web browser's kind of crappy, it doesn't support a lot of things, you know.
2300641	2303722	But now, I mean, a lot of the smartphones and stuff that are coming out
2305183	2309064	That comparison is no longer really valid because everything plays MP3s now.
2309405	2310585	Everything watches movies.
2311686	2318269	But if you're a gamer, you can't look at the iPhone games and take any of them seriously.
2319189	2320250	99% of them suck.
2321270	2325172	Especially the ones that are bad, bad, bad ports of real games.
2325292	2328234	That's true, but also 99% of them are under $20.
2328394	2330295	Hold on, I think Jamie wanted to jump in here.
2330652	2336278	No, I was just going to say I've been enjoying Final Fantasy 2 and Vi and a lot of games on there.
2336638	2339641	But I still think Final Fantasy 2 is better on the PSP.
2340703	2342424	Yes, because it has buttons.
2342744	2343624	Yes, exactly.
2344124	2344624	Exactly.
2344724	2345645	The argument does stand.
2345665	2346385	But I get it.
2346525	2346905	You're right.
2346965	2348686	The price is huge, too.
2348706	2349346	It's kind of cool, though.
2349386	2358249	One of the things, actually, I forgot to mention that I did this week as far as my game stuff, because I do have a jailbroken iPod, I downloaded an NES emulator on it, which is kind of neat.
2358449	2367792	But what's neat about it is you can actually, it has support via Bluetooth to sync a Wii Remote to it to use the Wii Remote to play the NES games on.
2369031	2382572	just totally random tangent question I want to ask Marissa so she doesn't feel left out here because the Wii is supposed to be that system that gets everybody no matter if you're a gamer or not it's just supposed to reach out to everybody have you ever played the Wii?
2383001	2389266	Oh yeah, my dad has a Wii and he likes my boyfriend to come over to play Mario with him so we can finally progress in levels.
2389386	2393529	Now your boyfriend doesn't try to get you to play Wii Fit while he sits behind you with a camera, right?
2394109	2400594	No, but it was funny, my dad thought that yoga was for wussies.
2402535	2403636	Oh wait, we're on the internet.
2403656	2407859	My dad thought yoga was for pussies until he tried the Wii Fit yoga.
2407999	2410000	Oh, you can say naughty language on the show, it's okay.
2410020	2411101	The internet is for porn, so why not?
2411121	2412022	That's right, that's right.
2412623	2421953	No, I've played the Wii, but I think the interesting thing is that so many games have come out now that's not just the emphasis on the schtick of using the motion control anymore.
2422614	2425057	Which is what a lot of us wanted in the very beginning, actually.
2425077	2428701	Like, okay, yay, we get it, there's motion control, now don't go overboard with it.
2428821	2430563	No, don't, stop, stop, you're getting too close to the edge.
2430883	2431124	Stop!
2431824	2436365	Hey, you know, it's better than the, at least the controller's better than the Gamecock, so the PSP.
2437786	2439906	You know, there was actually a game company called Gamecock.
2440266	2441767	I don't even know if they're still around.
2441807	2443587	I think I heard something about them shutting down.
2443707	2444527	They're terrible.
2444567	2446728	Didn't they do the Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game?
2446748	2447848	That was like their big thing.
2448948	2450489	Anyhow, moving on.
2451149	2454150	Let's talk about some other gaming news that doesn't have to do with the PSP.
2454190	2455070	Let's talk about the Kinect.
2455850	2459773	We were talking about Japanese and the way things were received in Japan a minute ago.
2459833	2461054	How about the Kinect launch in Japan?
2461474	2469740	Well, in Japan, Microsoft's new Kinect sold 26,000 units during the launch weekend of November 20th.
2470120	2473102	That includes both standalone and 360 bundled Kinects.
2473563	2475404	Now, here's something to keep in mind.
2475524	2476845	It sold a million of them.
2478306	2479546	I believe in the rest of the world.
2496235	2522537	so the fact that it sold 26,000 is actually pretty good considering the user base that exists compared to the rest of the world so there's a million ways you can kind of slice it but regardless that's what it is what I also thought was very interesting especially to a lot of the audience of this show guess what the highest selling launch title was in Japan it was Dance Masters was the highest selling launch title in Japan 6,000 copies of Dance Masters they didn't like their part
2522997	2531721	Well, keep in mind, they also don't have Dance Central, because Dance Central was a very kind of American type of game, especially when it comes to the licenses.
2533302	2544847	Being that Dance Masters relied pretty much completely on Konami Originals and Avex songs that I'm sure were dirt cheap to license here in the US, you pretty much have the same game overseas that you have here.
2545267	2547888	So very interesting the way that worked out.
2548268	2549989	But that almost sounds to me like
2550749	2555854	I'm not so sure that Kinect in Japan has that must-have title.
2556554	2567244	I mean, not to slam on Dance Masters, but I think that a game like Dance Central, maybe localized with J-pop hits and songs that are big in Japan, might do well.
2567324	2570387	I mean, heck, probably even a lot of the songs that are in it already.
2570467	2572789	I know there's a lot of the kind of cross-culture going on there.
2573610	2575471	Probably would do a lot better.
2576676	2578758	So I don't know, I'm kind of interested.
2579078	2581099	Does anybody kind of read into those numbers at all?
2581520	2583021	What do you guys think about those numbers?
2583101	2585143	Is that a good launch or is that a shitty launch?
2585463	2595731	Well, they just have a really small install base in Japan, so I'm not surprised that the numbers are a lot smaller than we have over here in the North American regions.
2597012	2598773	I'd say that's not bad, considering...
2600717	2601337	So we'll see.
2601497	2609140	I mean, it's so interesting now kind of where we're at in this generation where, you know, the PlayStation is such the bigger deal over in Japan.
2609200	2614521	I'd be more curious, and I haven't seen these numbers yet, as to how the move is doing over there compared to here because I bet it's doing better.
2614901	2618823	It is doing way better than that because there's more of an installed base.
2619183	2619403	Right.
2619823	2623464	But is it doing better there than it is here comparatively?
2623964	2624464	I don't think so.
2625725	2626265	I'd be curious.
2627833	2628893	Anyway, that's all I really had.
2628953	2636816	Kinect launched in Japan and we'll see what games come out over there and what all gets localized for Japan or vice versa, perhaps.
2637216	2639197	I just actually found something really sad just now.
2639297	2639617	What's that?
2639897	2640677	Leslie Nielsen died.
2641597	2642118	Oh, no!
2642198	2642998	The guy from Airplane Run?
2643018	2643658	The Naked Gun?
2643958	2644198	Yeah.
2644298	2645379	No!
2645499	2646459	He was getting really old.
2646579	2650080	Yeah, but I just happened to look and... That's horrible.
2650160	2650280	Sad.
2650540	2651300	That's a bummer.
2651741	2652521	Yeah, he was funny.
2652941	2653921	Way to bring down the show.
2654501	2655962	How about some happy news?
2657051	2658732	Let's talk about Marissa's boobs some more.
2658752	2659612	That'll cheer me up.
2660072	2661432	So, Marissa... No, I'm kidding.
2662033	2663593	I can see your dirty pillows.
2675157	2678101	Well, Eidos kind of got sucked into Square Enix.
2678221	2681465	Because, you know, Tomb Raider is still getting cranked out, but it's now by Square Enix.
2682326	2685870	And actually, the last arcade game they did, anyway, was really good.
2686390	2689154	So, you know, there's always hope.
2690115	2690936	Cross those fingers.
2692037	2693339	How about Something Happy?
2693399	2694240	How about Something Happy?
2694680	2699385	Well, BBC America is having programming available on PlayStation Network.
2699565	2702268	There will be the first episode of the U.S.
2702328	2708594	version of Top Gear, which is normally $1.99 SD or $2.99 HD.
2709495	2712618	And that's going to be up there for the first two weeks for free.
2712678	2714560	And Dan said it was actually really good.
2714580	2718304	He's a big Top Gear fan, so he said it was really up there.
2718504	2719885	It gets the Dan stamp of approval.
2719905	2721045	It gets the Dan stamp of approval.
2721165	2721585	Very nice.
2722265	2727167	Also, Doctor Who and Being Human will be up there on the launch list.
2728968	2735270	I'm sure everyone's heard me go off about Doctor Who, about how awesome it is, but Being Human is a really, really cool show.
2735310	2745674	It sounds kind of cheesy about a werewolf and his vampire friend moving into a flat that happens to be haunted by this girl that was killed there.
2746554	2749696	So yeah, a werewolf, a ghost, and a vampire live together.
2750017	2750697	Walk into a bar?
2751017	2752418	No.
2752939	2755500	But actually, it's a really good drama.
2755640	2756561	I actually really like it.
2757442	2759483	So it's one I recommend to people to watch.
2759763	2763326	But they're going to be adding more BBC shows on there.
2764687	2766388	I'm hoping to see Primeval show up.
2766428	2767229	That's another good show.
2769630	2770271	That's really cool.
2770311	2771051	That makes me happy.
2771171	2774854	That means that I actually have a reason to use my PlayStation store since I don't have cable.
2776604	2777564	Just cable internets.
2778904	2781445	Then again, I also have the internet.
2782825	2783085	Shh.
2784785	2786886	We're not supposed to be encouraging that here on this program.
2787486	2788126	What are you talking about?
2788146	2789326	I just watched streaming BBC TV.
2789346	2789986	There you go.
2790006	2791187	I'm telling you what not to do.
2791407	2794947	So the chat room is kind of reacting to the whole news about Leslie Nielsen.
2795827	2796888	He was 84 years old.
2797788	2798808	I didn't realize he was that old.
2798828	2799688	I'm telling you, he was old.
2800448	2803729	He was at least 60 when those Naked Gun movies came out in the 90s.
2803749	2805309	But he didn't age ever.
2805909	2807691	Ezam in our chatroom says, Happy news.
2808051	2811334	Leslie Nielsen is now a zombie and there's a new naked gun in the works.
2811594	2812255	So there you go.
2812975	2815918	Oh, that's... It'll probably be funnier than the last one.
2816994	2825520	The only movie I think he's done that I really didn't care for was Dracula Dead and Loving It, which is also sad because it was a Mel Brooks movie too and it wasn't all that good.
2845006	2848349	I can't say that there was a movie that he did that I did not like.
2849350	2850892	Say maybe Mr. Magoo.
2852682	2854243	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2883261	2884262	Married 9 times
2908232	2912254	Connect support is coming to the X and A in the future.
2913475	2918038	Apparently, developers will be getting the tools to make games supporting the Connect.
2919279	2920479	Just not right now.
2922180	2927924	They said that they're pleased to see developers tinkering around with, to a degree, the device.
2928444	2929565	And, of course...
2930325	2941294	They're saying that Microsoft classifies as someone accessing algorithms on the side of the Xbox for ill use or someone explaining the Kinect in a cheating manner not tolerable.
2942155	2951863	Of course, they're saying creating a driver that might open the USB connection or read C inputs from the sensor, on the other hand, are totally cool at Microsoft.
2952123	2957108	They're kind of referring to some of the homebrew hacks people have done on their PC.
2958289	2967036	And they said they have no timetable when Kinect support will come to the XNA, but it possibly will.
2967556	2970759	I imagine they will at some point.
2970779	2976384	They're going to want people taking advantage of their peripherals.
2976664	2977965	They'll be like saying, you know...
2979625	2985028	We're not really going to give you the algorithms and the device drivers to use our controllers.
2985608	2986569	But you can make games.
2986829	2988410	You just can't have anything to control them.
2989350	2994333	You know, maybe they're afraid that the indie developers are going to make better games than what's out there right now.
2994433	2995933	That wouldn't be that difficult.
2995993	2999815	When you open it up to the public, there's going to be all those ideas.
2999976	3004078	And there's going to be somebody that thinks it's something that the publishers have been too afraid to do.
3004098	3006119	And they're going to come up with that must-have game.
3006679	3007139	You know what I mean?
3008020	3008160	So...
3008780	3015644	Which reminds me, we actually need to do something a little bit out of order and out of character here on Orange Lingerie, but I need to go to the Twitters real quick.
3016945	3019306	I'm actually going to Twitter topics a little bit early in the show.
3019326	3025910	I'm not going to do them all, but there's one particular Twitter that caught my attention before the show tonight, and it has to do with XNA and all this stuff.
3026470	3030713	So I'm going to the Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and I want to read some tweets from Blue Swim.
3031093	3031553	Hey, you ready?
3031573	3032214	Okay.
3032814	3034496	BlueSwim had asked us a question on Twitter.
3035036	3040341	Have any of you played the Xbox Live indie game Techno Kitten Adventure?
3041662	3047827	Kitten plus jetpack plus club music plus rainbows plus pink ponies equals win.
3048607	3053191	And he actually sent us a little YouTube here of what the game in motion looks like.
3053792	3056274	And of course, that doesn't make for great radio.
3056674	3059817	But just to give you an idea, here's what the soundtrack sounds like.
3067286	3087400	Now, to tell you what's going on, in the game, there's a little kitten on a jetpack flying through different obstacles, and he's dodging these pink unicorns that are flying at him, and these UFOs, and falling stars, which are referenced in the song, if you listen to the lyrics of the song, and these little boats with colored tracks.
3087500	3088981	I don't think he actually has to dodge all that.
3089021	3091203	I think it's just the blocks he has to dodge.
3091223	3092744	The rest is just background music.
3092924	3098490	This is kind of like Robot Unicorn Attack, but like 10 times more awesome!
3100492	3103715	I like the stars.
3104596	3107259	And whenever he crashes into objects, he goes, meow.
3109062	3110003	Look at the high scores.
3110023	3113285	It's like a bad, like, was it YTMD or something?
3113305	3116047	If you were high, this game would just make you pass out.
3116267	3117408	Like, seriously.
3117428	3118468	I just don't even know.
3119049	3126714	So, my point is, this is quite possibly the most amazing thing I've ever seen someone do on the Xbox 360.
3127354	3128515	And it's on the indie market.
3128575	3135280	In fact, I've decided we are going to track this guy down and get him on the show, whoever made this game, because I need to know more about this right now.
3136120	3136560	Right now.
3140944	3146389	Obviously, the publishers and the big activisions and EAs of the world are too afraid of Techno Kitten Adventure.
3147591	3154257	And getting their, you know, multi-millions from, I'm sure, what this is going to sell on the indie marketplace.
3155679	3156059	Amazing.
3156119	3157020	Techno Kitten Adventure.
3157040	3157460	There you go.
3159972	3160812	Damn, that was amazing.
3161813	3163313	Thank you to Blue Swim for pointing that out.
3163413	3166014	I am immediately going home and buying that after the show, just so you know.
3166674	3167715	I will too, buy that.
3168495	3169255	Look at that, look at that.
3169475	3174197	You just sold two copies off that game, and how hard could that game have possibly been to make?
3174217	3176858	And I haven't bought anything off of X and A for a long time.
3177038	3183180	But it was an idea that no one else had thought of yet, or was too afraid to do.
3183200	3183560	Meow.
3183640	3184020	I don't know.
3184040	3184401	Meow.
3184981	3185921	And I welcome the sequel.
3186181	3187542	That game scared Shermie out of the room.
3187742	3188162	Did it?
3190844	3192385	The chatters are like, what is this?
3192565	3193165	Link now.
3193285	3193826	Send us a link.
3193846	3194186	Here you go.
3194226	3196087	I'll give you the same link Blue Swim gave me.
3196627	3197248	There you go.
3197368	3199829	I'll put watch now.
3201009	3201290	There you go.
3201310	3201970	I just put that there.
3203051	3205432	Azam in the chat says, President Jetpack Cat.
3206152	3209094	Actdeft says, we have our new President Cat and it has a jetpack.
3209874	3211655	Orange Right says, Jetpack Cat.
3213016	3213336	Sure.
3213776	3214536	We endorse this.
3214656	3215357	Jetpack Cat.
3217099	3218220	President Cat's Cousin.
3219220	3220601	In fact, I will make a tweet right now.
3221582	3221902	Right now.
3221982	3224964	President Cat's Cousin, Jetpack Cat, you must get this game right now.
3226364	3226765	There you go.
3226905	3228806	Some indie guy is going to be like, WTF?
3229266	3231647	All right, anyhow, let me get into another story here.
3231667	3240432	And there's a link right there in chat, Alphina, Canandagram, because now you can, of course, set everything up to download.
3240693	3241073	Thank you.
3242594	3246436	See, you know what's funny is that half our listeners are going to buy it tonight, and then the guy's going to go in like,
3246926	3247386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3271124	3278281	But whatever, Sony seems to think that 3D is the place to be But wait, did you see the box art?
3278862	3279724	No I didn't
3285868	3288849	Can you try to describe the box art because it is a radio show?
3289289	3298132	The box art is of a little kitten staring up at something that looks really fucking trippy and it's awesome.
3299093	3309396	And of course, their little description, it says, Navigate a kitten by jetpack fueled by hopes and dreams through a fantastical world of techno music.
3309496	3311057	I want him on our show.
3311157	3312037	Who made this game?
3312197	3314078	I want him on the show next week or her.
3314318	3314758	Whoever.
3314818	3320481	Featuring DJ Hixie, Sea of Love, Frisco, all around the world, Productions Limited.
3320581	3321542	Who made this game?
3322122	3322783	Bring them to me.
3322943	3326485	OL Army, find me this person and bring them to me.
3326505	3333148	Mono X. Mono X. Marissa's laughing over there.
3333188	3333629	She's dying.
3333669	3334109	You all right?
3335314	3336055	That's awesome.
3337376	3343560	I'm going to submit this image of the box art to our image feed there.
3344320	3345821	Fueled by hopes and dreams.
3348463	3352046	Blue Swim, if this is a friend of yours, I want them on the show now.
3352506	3353246	Bring them to me.
3353767	3354047	All right.
3355168	3357790	Maybe bathe him and bring him to me.
3359571	3361572	He is being summoned to our castle.
3361952	3362213	All right.
3362233	3362553	All right.
3362918	3363479	Sony, 3D, whatever
3382218	3404329	20 games internally at Sony alone are going to be converted for the 3D TV a quote here from Mick Hocking with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe overall we have more than 50 titles currently being converted into 3D and this number is growing fast some of them are massive names that's a really really good sign that the industry is behind our unique message that 3D is a key element in the future of home consoles
3405149	3421475	is it just me or do I kind of read that as well you know the 3DS everybody's got a boner about so 3D must be the future is that kind of I don't know maybe that's just what I read and this would be Sony saying this yeah Mick Hawking with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe that's odd that they would think that 3D is the future of entertainment
3422675	3425636	because Sony makes 3D TVs.
3425656	3426316	Imagine that.
3426916	3434377	That's so crazy in that they would have 3D Blu-rays that they'd be pushing for their console.
3434477	3436438	Yeah, biased much?
3436958	3440339	By the way, over 50 3D games in development overall.
3440679	3442819	20 of them are just the internals there at Sony.
3442879	3446060	So 3D is the wave of the future, everybody.
3446760	3447200	There you go.
3447620	3450644	I have officially purchased Technokitten Adventure.
3450684	3456112	I need to make the tweet about that, but I've been reading the news, so I need DarkSakura to do a new story so I can go to the Twitters.
3457509	3459910	Well, how about something about Piece of Shit 14?
3460010	3462871	I mean, Final Fantasy 14.
3463011	3465952	It looks like they're actually going to be doing an update to it.
3466813	3474676	It's going to be fixing the skill point allocation, UI response time, more accessible user interface.
3474696	3477097	There's actually a lot of stuff up on their official website.
3477717	3479638	But basically, everyone said, it's crap!
3480638	3492008	So, the Square Enix VP of Software Development, Hiromichi Tanaka said, The development team is working really hard to bring it back to the level we plan to have ready for the players.
3493829	3496432	Yeah, in fact, there's a whole bunch of updates ready for it.
3496532	3500015	According to the site, and I'm trying to pull all the information up...
3501716	3505759	More tutorials, more stuff to some of the scenarios.
3505899	3509001	Yes, no confirmation prompt when you're selecting a path companion.
3511342	3513103	Difficulties have been adjusted.
3514624	3515244	Lots of stuff.
3517566	3518867	Let me know if it's less crappy, people.
3519107	3520347	Do they patch in fun?
3520828	3522489	Is fun in one of the bullet points?
3522689	3524450	There's one that says collecting seashells.
3525168	3526928	Well, that sounds kind of stupid.
3527809	3529489	Maximum HP has been increased.
3530369	3531629	What about kittens with jetpacks?
3531809	3532570	Do we have any of those yet?
3534070	3535450	Let me see kittens, kittens, kittens.
3535470	3537050	Hey, man, I got a game idea, man.
3537070	3537911	You won't believe this.
3539491	3541471	Kittens, jetpacks.
3541571	3542792	Nothing about kittens.
3545372	3546252	Nothing about kittens, Rob.
3546272	3546452	Fail!
3546472	3546652	Fail.
3550419	3555842	Well, actually, though, Final Fantasy does have the Mithra, or whatever they're calling them now in Final Fantasy XIV.
3555882	3557303	Maybe they changed the name to Mazithra.
3557363	3557683	I don't know.
3557983	3560264	But the kitten people, the cat people.
3560304	3562685	Isn't Mazithra like a pasta or something like that?
3562785	3563606	It's kind of cheese.
3563626	3564486	It's my favorite dish.
3564566	3566567	It's my favorite dish at the old spaghetti factory.
3569569	3570789	Mazithra con gusto, actually.
3570809	3572310	Oh my god, we were talking about that before the show.
3574031	3574651	Favorite dish.
3580512	3583174	I hope your boyfriend isn't listening because you might get that line when you get home.
3584395	3586277	It's time for Mazithra Congusto.
3588659	3589760	He's long hair, Chris.
3589800	3590220	Sorry, boys.
3590240	3590601	She's taken.
3590621	3590881	Anyhow.
3597587	3599088	Let's move on.
3599728	3603251	Talk about some release dates of other games that are coming out around the world.
3603271	3604291	And we'll start off in the U.S.
3604331	3606513	Although things are starting to slow down a little bit, right?
3606573	3607394	That would be correct.
3607814	3609035	Not a lot this week.
3609375	3612117	And thankfully not a lot of crappy games I can talk about.
3612697	3613358	But there's a few.
3613758	3619102	So we'll talk about Chevrolet Camaro Wild Ride, which I'm sure is awesome.
3619142	3620083	That's coming out on the Wii.
3621284	3626111	Deadliest Catch Sea of Chaos coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3626512	3631299	And you better believe it, the Xbox 360 will be supporting the Kinect and the PS3, the Move.
3632440	3634864	Sniper Elite on the Nintendo Wii.
3636045	3638767	Let's see here.
3639707	3640888	A game called Nailed.
3641108	3644089	That's supposed to be a pretty awesome ATV off-road racing game.
3644110	3646751	That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3647511	3649452	Epic Mickey on the Wii.
3651053	3652574	A game called Spellforce 2.
3653575	3654775	Faith in Destiny.
3655075	3656296	That's on PC.
3658097	3661139	And Golden Sun, Dark Dawn.
3661679	3663380	Coming out on DS this week.
3665296	3666980	And that is it.
3668905	3670127	Oh, there's still some big titles in there.
3670147	3671651	I thought Epic Mickey had already come out.
3671791	3672713	No, it came out this week.
3673495	3673736	Oh, okay.
3674426	3675247	And it's epic.
3675447	3678129	Oh, and it looks like Hello Kitty Seasons was delayed another week.
3678169	3679309	That is now coming out this week.
3679489	3680430	Yippee skippee.
3681251	3682411	All right, let's go over to Japan.
3682471	3683892	Oh, and I'm sorry, real quick.
3684153	3684933	No, you're done.
3685093	3689716	This isn't a game, but the wireless pro guitar for the Wii is coming out this week.
3689976	3690217	All right.
3690917	3693719	All right, moving on to Japan and the Japanese release dates.
3693759	3696921	Things are slowing down a tad over there as well, but there are still some games.
3697461	3700043	Battlefield Bad Company 2 gets the Ultimate Edition.
3700083	3701984	That's the Japanese version, not an import.
3702024	3703886	That comes out in Japan this week.
3705026	3709187	December 2nd, also going on to the PlayStation 3.
3709707	3711228	There's a few games on there.
3711748	3713148	There's Battlefield Battle Company there.
3713488	3716209	Dante's Inferno gets a price reduction, so does Killzone 2.
3716629	3721570	Hokuto Musou International comes out this week, as well as Fusa Sareta Shibuya Day.
3721870	3723191	That's a price reduction as well.
3723571	3728692	A new game called Tales of Graces F, that's from Namco Bandai, comes out this week.
3729392	3732273	I'm assuming that is in the Tales of Graces series.
3732953	3735134	Oh, it was a Wii game, originally.
3735555	3740458	And they're saying it's not just a port, it actually expands the world and adds a whole new epilogue to the game.
3740618	3743079	So, neat.
3743239	3761370	On other platforms, this week in Japan, looking at the Nintendo Wii, trying to see if there's anything, just Taiko no Tatsujin, some of our music game fans like that game, Mina de Party comes out this week, Naruto Shippuden, Gekkoutou Ninja Taisen Special comes out this week, and Babysitter Mama,
3762051	3764552	is a big release this week in Japan.
3782202	3782422	Outro Music
3799685	3803487	I'm sorry, but in this screenshot in the game, is she throwing a baby?
3803587	3805408	Like, what is happening in this picture?
3805468	3808510	There's like some type of like, throw the Wiimote this way.
3808570	3812732	It's like baby tossing into a hot frying pan or something.
3813533	3814753	Is she cooking the baby?
3815414	3816734	It's a liver, a nice candy.
3819830	3821031	I'm going to put that in our chat room.
3821071	3822212	You come up with your own opinions.
3822252	3822573	I'm sorry.
3822613	3825355	It looks like she's throwing the baby into a pot.
3825575	3826756	Do not throw the baby.
3828298	3830300	What are they teaching the kids over there in Japan?
3832153	3835635	All right, at All Serious is some other games on the Sony PSP this week.
3835795	3837597	Kamen Rider Climax Heroes 000.
3838357	3840278	Ooh.
3841199	3842440	That's really the name of the game.
3842500	3844181	Kamen Rider Climax Heroes.
3844361	3845141	Ooh.
3846462	3847703	Climax Heroes.
3848263	3848464	Ooh.
3849384	3851325	Riders from Cougar to Oz.
3851866	3852286	Cougar.
3852606	3855568	Breaks through the boundaries that separates their series in this game.
3855688	3856609	It's a fighting game.
3857850	3859871	And it's powered up the men with more skills.
3862870	3865333	LocoRoco 2 gets a price reduction on the PSP.
3866775	3867196	That's it.
3867316	3867737	I'm spent.
3867817	3869479	That's it for releases this week in Japan.
3869519	3869839	How about UK?
3871815	3880681	Ace Combat 11 Skies of Incursion, BlazBlue Continuum Shift, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition, and the Sly Collection.
3880701	3882163	That's about it.
3882183	3882823	A few biggies.
3898087	3901871	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
3902011	3902792	But first, Loki.
3905077	3908999	By the way, I found a way to contact the guy.
3909639	3909999	Did you?
3910260	3910580	Yes.
3911660	3911920	All right.
3912141	3913201	We'll get to that later.
3913981	3914742	We'll talk offline.
3915002	3915202	Yes.
3915902	3916163	Okay.
3916503	3917643	So, fun stuff.
3919604	3920765	This is kind of neat.
3921085	3928469	CD Projekt, and that's spelled P-R-O-J-E-K-T, like Jekt, as in Final Fantasy X.
3929869	3934513	Um, they're fighting Witcher 2 piracy with a threat of a fine.
3935154	3944881	That's right, there's not going to be any DRM in the actual title, but if they find out that you're pirating the game, they're going to hunt you down.
3946722	3955405	We are signing with legal firms and torrent sneaking companies to hunt down gamers who download The Witcher 2 unlawfully.
3955945	3965729	Such offenders will be sent a letter demanding they pay a fine, the sum of which was left unspecified, though it sounds they'll be more than the game's suggested retail price.
3966789	3974233	And it says, we don't want to be harsh, but there's a chance that this might happen to some people if they download it illegally.
3974674	3978476	Or in other words, I guess, don't make them mad.
3979056	3980657	So is this like policing through fear?
3981797	3983138	Or what exactly is the deal?
3983438	3984259	It sounds like it.
3984279	3988321	Honestly, though, I don't think that they're going to be able to follow through with this.
3988401	3988901	You know what I mean?
3989602	3990562	It's a cute picture.
3991563	3991923	I don't know.
3991943	3993043	I thought that's why you sent it to me.
3993444	3993944	Oh, no, it's fine.
3994004	3994184	It's fine.
3994705	3996608	It seems like an awful lot.
3997349	4000874	Considering that as soon as this gets pirated, it's going to be all over the place.
4002136	4005161	It's going to be a little hard to track down every single person that's downloaded it.
4006042	4008165	I'd say it's more of an empty thread if you ask me.
4009066	4010028	They may try, but...
4010529	4012029	Or they'll make an example of one.
4012089	4022951	Like they did that one chick that was in Wisconsin or whatever that, you know, some mom that they took to court over some crappy songs that she downloaded and they want to put her through the ringer for like $2 million or whatever it is.
4023331	4024512	You know, crazy.
4024812	4026472	Well, just here's what you do.
4027172	4035994	You just don't download it on a torrent site because they get you for sharing and so therefore, you know, you're, you know...
4037549	4058907	I guess pirating stuff or you're sharing it with other people so they can claim a loss that's more than the retail copy of the game but if you download it like a direct download or something like that really they're only losing one copy so it'd be a harder argument for them and I don't think they can really track you that well and who really gives a crap about The Witcher 2 anyways that's my opinion
4059487	4062169	Did a pic of Marissa's boobs go up on the internet or something?
4062189	4063390	Because I just noticed the chat.
4063450	4066972	I thought that she sent me the picture for the sake of showing the listeners.
4068333	4069633	But it was for your private collection.
4071866	4074007	It is not the entire boobs.
4074027	4076149	I thought it would be a good promo for the afterbirth.
4077269	4079591	Watch the whole show.
4079631	4080512	Hang out for the boobs.
4080632	4083073	Ranma says, God damn, those are some tig old biddies.
4083093	4090258	They actually look bigger because of the way I'm posing that photo.
4090558	4091979	Just let them believe whatever they want.
4092219	4093300	Let them believe whatever they want.
4093540	4094941	Don't get rid of their hope!
4095001	4097702	It does suck when you wake up in the morning and you hit yourself in the face, but...
4099761	4100582	You know what, though?
4100662	4105848	Despite all the fun we're having, sometimes the tickle bitties can kind of be a pain in the ass.
4105928	4107310	Like, it's not all fun and games.
4107871	4108491	Pain in the ass?
4108511	4109392	More like a pain in the back.
4109452	4110554	Yes, exactly.
4112595	4112915	All right.
4113656	4116257	Anyhow, do we mention she's a musician as well?
4116297	4120660	And you should buy her music if you're going to like be all like boobies.
4120680	4121420	All right.
4121500	4121781	Anyhow.
4122221	4124442	No, I actually this is a kind of a serious story.
4124482	4126663	And this this kind of shit just makes me so angry.
4127384	4129785	I want to talk about this for a minute because this is serious.
4129965	4131586	So less titties, more serious.
4132387	4134988	This is about something going on in Call of Duty's Black Ops.
4135229	4135349	And
4136249	4149260	I guess, and again, these are not usually the type of games I play, but I guess there is a mode where you can design your own logos, and these logos will kind of go on the uniforms of the people that you are controlling.
4149900	4151662	Well, of course, give a guy a...
4152262	4152903	PEN AND PAPER
4170023	4175785	doesn't find it funny at all and says, quote, it's not political correctness, it's fundamental respect.
4176285	4181207	If you think the swastika symbol should be reevaluated by societies all over the earth, I think that's great.
4181487	4187209	Your Xbox Live profile or in-game logo, which doesn't have the context to explain your goal, is not the right place to do that.
4187569	4194672	And by the way, that doesn't just go for the swastika, it applies to many other symbols as well that my team does indeed take action on when we see it.
4195012	4195833	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4224953	4225723	uh uh uh
4226283	4255452	you are on a private network and part of the terms of service is don't be a douchebag and I'm sorry but if you're putting this logo you're only doing it to provoke a reaction of some sort you're just trying to be a douchebag there's really no nice way to say it you're just trying to cause a little controversy and be a douchebag can't you just play the fucking game like seriously like why do people have to just be dicks you know draw a penis
4256516	4257657	Penises aren't offensive.
4258418	4260561	Draw a cunt if that makes you feel better.
4261101	4262943	Draw Marissa's boobies if you want.
4262983	4265246	That's not offensive at all.
4267697	4294339	I can't believe though in Call of Duty already they've managed to black ops everything is a dick or my boyfriend's icon is humping bunnies and yeah it's just ever since you know prehistoric times you see ancient cave paintings of penises that just continues to this day there you go so you know what especially in a war game it's just unappropriate thank you very much he-man stuff
4298707	4301889	Actdeft in our chatroom says, Don't be a douchebag should really be there.
4301969	4303750	Textual in the terms of service.
4305391	4306072	You know what I say.
4307012	4310475	I'm not offended by the symbol itself.
4311015	4312236	It's been used in many cultures.
4313156	4315158	It's a good luck charm in many of them.
4315818	4321302	It's on American architecture from before 1942.
4322683	4326826	But when you have it up there in black on a white background with red around it,
4327726	4330128	That's saying something, and that's offensive.
4330228	4332310	Especially in the context of a war game.
4332350	4332890	Exactly.
4333651	4335672	It's like, you know what you're doing.
4337714	4340816	And I'm sure there's these guys, what about my freedom of speech?
4342397	4343458	It's just a symbol.
4343498	4346581	You go on the street and yell whatever you want.
4346601	4348262	You agree to the terms you play by them.
4349198	4349678	Exactly.
4350979	4351340	You know what?
4351880	4356364	If you want to display whatever you want to, then you can do it without their service.
4357385	4358185	You don't have to pay for it.
4359186	4360627	You know, here's the thing.
4360887	4373858	If you are the type of person that just feels this need to provoke people with the symbol, why don't you stop hiding behind your Xbox and why don't you go out onto the street and yell, I love Hitler and see what happens to you?
4374178	4375960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4395097	4402579	I just think it's ironic that people that are usually supposed to be the example of white supremacy aren't really good examples, and people you never want to fuck anyway, so.
4402719	4403039	Yeah.
4403220	4408441	It's just the most, I always think of the Greg Probst bit, the white race is a superior race.
4409061	4416784	It's like most homophobes I meet are usually like, well, I don't like gay guys because, you know, they all want to put it in my butt.
4416904	4417324	Really?
4417344	4417464	Yeah.
4417924	4419365	Don't flatter yourself.
4419385	4421507	Yeah, exactly.
4422167	4424909	You're like not even on the list.
4425049	4426430	You're not in the top 20.
4426510	4426790	You know what?
4426810	4430073	You're not even in the top 9 million, actually.
4430113	4434196	In fact, there is no list that you're on whatsoever.
4434376	4436797	So just don't flatter yourself.
4437158	4437838	Exactly.
4438539	4438999	And you know what?
4439820	4445884	And honestly, if a guy did happen to hit on you, I have to say, not interested.
4445904	4445984	Yeah.
4448454	4452180	Usually, that'll say, well, I'm not interested.
4452220	4454163	You know what it is?
4454203	4456306	I think all of hate comes back to?
4456927	4457468	Insecurity.
4458732	4459092	Don't you think?
4459613	4460033	Absolutely.
4460513	4471660	And so these people who think, oh, well, I'm going to bring attention to myself by using something that I know is going to offend people and I'm going to do all this shock value.
4471820	4473781	All it's doing is just making you look like a douche.
4473801	4475022	Give me attention!
4475202	4477983	Well, this is what I would like.
4478984	4481325	And I'm sorry for getting a little ranty on this.
4481586	4482226	No, it's okay.
4482946	4487029	I think that, and I have the same opinion towards cussing, by the way.
4487449	4496857	We needed some good controversy tonight, so... I think that by bringing... The more people make a big deal out of something, you know what I mean?
4497678	4498859	I mean, about certain things.
4499700	4505845	The more power they're actually giving to it as opposed to what should be happening, and that's taking the power out of it.
4506586	4509368	That's taking the fear out of an object, you know what I mean?
4509848	4510209	Taking...
4510789	4516813	And I understand that you don't want to ever forget what happened, what brought these about.
4516854	4525180	But at the same time, you don't want to keep giving people the power to hurt you with whatever means they want to.
4526180	4532885	And I think it's very good that they're going to ban the use on Xbox Live.
4532925	4533345	That's good.
4534406	4539130	But I do at the same time think that that's just also giving a little bit more fuel to...
4539910	4543932	and, you know, I'm trying to see how to phrase this right because I believe they were right.
4544352	4545632	I'm 100% behind that.
4545672	4546753	I think that's good.
4546853	4547933	Thank you for taking a stand.
4547973	4548733	I think that's really good.
4549694	4558957	But at the same time, I think that that's just lighting a little bit more fire under their butts and starting more controversy by going out and making a big statement about it.
4559597	4561498	I just think the band should have been quiet.
4564175	4564796	Does that make sense?
4564876	4566097	No, it does.
4566317	4569779	Ban it, but don't go out and do a press statement saying, oh, we're banning it.
4570379	4571100	Here's your cookie.
4571360	4572440	Haters gonna hate, man.
4572620	4573861	That's it.
4574081	4576303	Haters gonna hate.
4576443	4578304	Hey, that's my line.
4578404	4586829	Why make a big deal out of the haters when you can just, you know, if they protest it, send them an email, you've been banned for this, this, and this.
4586969	4587790	I will say this.
4588130	4589971	It wasn't quite a press release.
4590031	4602059	Just so you know, the guy who is with Xbox runs a personal blog, and he addressed this issue in his personal blog, which the game blogs picked up because he happens to have that position.
4602399	4604661	So just to be fair, it is not a press release.
4605021	4614908	It was his personal blog, where I think that's actually kind of neat that he touches on these touchy subjects in his personal blog, where maybe he can't say it in a press release.
4614988	4615728	That I'm better with.
4617209	4629266	I mean, but if it had been out like a press release, that's just, you know, it's sort of like, you know, when a little kid, you tell them they can't do something and they want to do it even more because you tell them that they can't do it.
4630665	4650204	here's a direct quote from the dude's blog and I love this because it's the TLDR too long didn't read at the end if you see offensive symbols in Call of Duty Black Ops report them using the in-game option and they will be taken care of if you want to argue that swastikas are actually awesome go to another forum on Xbox Live they are not allowed happy face
4651593	4652574	I agree with that.
4652594	4652894	I agree.
4653615	4656897	Because it's just making them think it's all the better to do.
4656917	4657618	Oh, it's pushing buttons.
4657638	4658919	Let's do it some more.
4682200	4683661	I could get into this whole other topic.
4683921	4690625	Obviously, you have a lot of passion on a lot of these types of issues because of your recent conversion to Judaism.
4691246	4693327	I have a lot of passion on the homophobia issues.
4693367	4698170	And I could get into this whole thing about the whole, like, I don't agree with trying to drag people out of the closet.
4698830	4702492	But that's for another episode when that's the topic.
4702813	4706755	But there's always different perspectives.
4708296	4711358	I just think people just need to get over themselves.
4712236	4714497	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4714677	4717279	The classic game of the week is Smash TV!
4741684	4744410	Yes, we're going to blow shit up this Classic Game of the Week.
4744610	4744971	Awesome.
4745291	4745993	Skip up a little bit.
4746253	4746875	Skip up a little bit.
4748855	4750616	Smash TV was made in 1990.
4751116	4753617	It was William's game.
4754197	4755818	Mark Tramiel was one of the people behind it.
4755898	4757399	He, of course, gave us Mortal Kombat.
4757779	4758459	Any big surprise there?
4760040	4762261	It was published by Acclaim for the home systems.
4762601	4766503	And basically, it is based off of... The other creator was Eugene Jarvis.
4766563	4769484	It was based off of his game Robotron 2084.
4769805	4772546	So it's got a dual joystick control.
4773526	4801018	and it's sort of taking elements from The Running Man where basically you're on a violent video game show you're on a violent game show it's set in 1999 and basically you have to run around and shoot people who are trying to kill you and you get power-ups and weapons and bonus prizes and it has a game show host who has the best lines ever I'd buy that for a dollar
4801678	4804701	Big money, big prizes.
4805462	4806283	I love it.
4807304	4807885	Exactly.
4809006	4816454	And actually, the I'd buy that for a dollar was from a comic in Robocop.
4818136	4819057	Wow, nice.
4819097	4819277	Yeah.
4820277	4823358	Thank you for watching!
4837382	4845730	Um, it's come out on the NES, the SNES as Super Smash TV, on the Game Gear, the Genesis slash Master System slash Mega Drive as Super Smash TV.
4847011	4854398	Um, you actually can use, on the NES, you can use the directional pad on the second controller to, uh, control where you're shooting.
4855259	4857341	Um, you have to use the multi-tap though to get that done.
4858141	4868046	It also came out, it was produced by Ocean for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Commodore Amiga in 1992.
4868146	4872388	I actually had no idea it was on the Commodore 64.
4872448	4873329	I thought I had every game.
4874149	4875370	Oh, Rob failed.
4875510	4875850	I know.
4876730	4884234	It came out in 1999 as part of the Arcade Party Pack that came out on PlayStation, which is, I do believe, where the clip that I sent you came from.
4886125	4890247	It was on Midway Arcade Treasures, which is on PC, GameCube, Xbox, PS2.
4891368	4893149	And they will save your high scores.
4894329	4896750	You can get it on the Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360.
4897071	4899032	It's 400 Microsoft points.
4900832	4904354	But I think that they've actually taken the purchase off.
4905715	4911218	But yeah, the creators had said that they were considering a Smash TV 2.
4912318	4913559	So that's pretty interesting.
4914159	4916220	But anyway, the game's fun.
4917441	4924264	Dan was actually, I mentioned it on the show before, but his buddy Eric was over here, and Eric had never played Smash TV.
4924864	4927226	So Dan's like, edumacation!
4928686	4931688	DJ Dark Knight in our chatroom asks, wasn't the host the final boss?
4933055	4962602	I never got that far like I said I remember your husband has like the achievements on Xbox Live for like the really uber stuff that's like oh my god how does he do it yeah it's a hard game yeah no Dan Dan's really good at and he used to play it all the time from what I remember him saying and you can I say something else you're speaking of Dan sure tomorrow is his birthday oh he's gonna be years old 21 that's good to know
4963640	4964381	35.
4964121	4964381	Okay.
4965882	4967044	And I love my sweetie.
4967364	4972409	So I dedicate this classic game of the week to my boy, to my Dan-chan.
4973810	4974210	Shut up!
4975752	4976713	No, that's cute.
4976973	4978955	He's not even here to hear it, the jerk!
4978975	4980036	You'll have to play it back for him.
4980936	4981297	Hearts.
4981497	4981897	There you go.
4982858	4983759	Happy birthday, Dan.
4983919	4985200	Happy birthday, Dan!
4985220	4985681	Hippo birdies.
4986802	4987402	Hippo birdies?
4987863	4988824	Hippo birdies to yous.
4989804	4991665	Oh, okay.
4992705	4997206	Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.
4998046	5003447	Come on back for part B. There's plenty more to come tonight, including the rest of your Twitter topics, of which there's quite a few tonight.
5003848	5005348	A lot of rapid news tonight.
5006188	5007989	Some mailbag stuff.
5008329	5009849	Get in your emails if you haven't gotten them in yet.
5010649	5012651	Some news about new Castlevania download content.
5013171	5015733	Maybe a game if I have time to write questions.
5015933	5016533	Maybe.
5016553	5018615	We're running a little bit long tonight, though, so we'll see.
5018875	5022237	I kind of want to take a lot of calls if we can, so we might push the game around.
5022277	5022557	We'll see.
5024298	5028661	We will be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so don't go anywhere.
5028701	5029422	We'll be right back.
5035441	5040445	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5040505	5046549	We are taping live on this Sunday evening as we do every week at allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
5046609	5052093	It is episode number 391 of our show for November the 28th of 2010.
5052153	5058377	We are joined here tonight with our special guest Marissa, Marissa Congusto with the busto.
5060137	5060877	But we do love her.
5061098	5063359	And she likes her old school adventure games.
5063639	5068422	You know, she might not be much of a hardcore gamer, but she definitely has an appreciation for what King's Quest you were saying.
5068802	5069903	What's your favorite King's Quest game?
5070663	5071083	You know what?
5071524	5072604	Say four, say four, say four.
5073385	5074245	Because that was my favorite.
5076206	5078407	I'm losing track of the numbers even though I just played them the other day.
5079447	5080647	The one with the really annoying owl.
5080848	5083088	I know that sounds like I don't know the game, but I adored that game.
5083148	5084849	Oh, good game!
5086309	5088210	That sounds like five.
5088230	5089670	I think that's five, yeah.
5089690	5092231	And that's sad that I know that, but I think that might be five.
5092251	5094911	Sorry, I'm having a blonde moment mixing up my numbers.
5094992	5095372	It's all good.
5095632	5098673	Space Quest I also loved, and of course Salmon Max.
5098713	5099993	There you go, there you go.
5100013	5100133	Yeah.
5100493	5105576	I'm doing a search for King's Quest Annoying Owl and it was King's Quest 5.
5106337	5107137	Oh, yes.
5107698	5109219	Have you previously played King's Quest 5?
5109259	5109639	No.
5109759	5111140	Every goddamn game.
5112681	5114842	So you were just a Sierra fangirl, basically.
5115343	5115903	I really was.
5116543	5118364	I loved Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.
5118965	5119685	And LucasArts.
5119725	5120906	That was an awesome game.
5121046	5122247	And it's desktop adventures.
5122267	5122687	What the fuck?
5124128	5125930	The Annoying Owl
5142247	5142768	Crazy, crazy.
5159464	5161285	Huge week in World of Warcraft.
5161305	5162645	We had a jumbo podcast this week.
5162685	5164185	It's called Horde House.
5164265	5165426	That's how you found it on Twitter.
5166046	5167646	Well, yeah, it's on Twitter, but also iTunes.
5168147	5170067	H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E.
5170087	5171347	The best little Horde House in Azeroth.
5171387	5173528	Myself and Extra were talking about Warcraft.
5173968	5177229	And DarkSakura has a comic book podcast that she hosts with some friends.
5177869	5179110	A comic book podcast.
5179130	5181130	A comic-ass podcast.
5185091	5188533	It's called Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y.
5189353	5194295	And we record on Sunday in the mornings and we go up on Tuesday.
5195175	5202958	And we're an excellent little podcast involving me and Mar and Marvel, or Tiara, and Dan Shadow.
5203418	5204319	And we talk about comics.
5205439	5207141	Today was mostly talking about Star Trek.
5208582	5215069	One of these days we need to get Worlds to collide and we need to get Tiara, Dan, and Extifer all on a show and just see what happens.
5215229	5215890	World of Warcraft.
5215910	5216511	It would be fun.
5217271	5220074	Oh yeah, I would just revert to World of Warcraft talk because they play WoW, huh?
5220855	5224719	Yeah, meanwhile I'm the one with taste that plays Star Trek Online.
5225260	5226821	We need to get them on Horde House.
5226901	5228283	I did make Vice Admiral, by the way.
5229223	5230104	Congratulations.
5230484	5232005	I can't rank anymore.
5232386	5235728	I leveled a priest to 24 in like three days.
5236549	5236909	Good.
5238530	5241372	I'm now on my Klingon character who's not actually Klingon.
5242253	5244654	Alright, let's get back into some rapid fire news.
5244694	5246516	Loki's just like, I don't have a spinoff show.
5246556	5247036	I have a baby.
5248615	5249155	Thanks for watching!
5271264	5273065	It was named after a soda.
5273165	5273405	Shut up.
5273705	5277026	You mixed video game music live on air.
5277086	5281447	You actually had turntables and maybe like nine people listened because it was on a Friday night.
5281667	5283968	It was so underappreciated, but you did such an awesome job.
5284028	5287329	If there's still MP3s of that show floating around, people should try to find them.
5287649	5288349	This is a great show.
5289189	5290030	I have all of them.
5292479	5315718	Uh, yeah, so, rapid fire news, um, the VGA is right around the corner, and of course with the Video Game Awards shows that are on, um, Spike, they of course show some new trailers for games that haven't been announced yet, and one of those trailers is being teased right now, and of course, um, no one knows exactly what it is, but yeah, we know exactly what it is.
5316438	5319261	Um, apparently the game is going to be a new Resident Evil game.
5319301	5330149	The way we know that is because apparently a while back they made a Resident Evil t-shirt with the exact same silhouettes of the zombies that are featured in the teaser.
5330850	5331430	Oopsie.
5332731	5334171	So yes, it's a new Resident Evil game.
5334211	5337612	Wow, that is recycled artwork if I've ever seen it before.
5337992	5343974	I mean, it's hard to convey on the radio, but Loki's looking at a side-by-side comparison.
5344054	5346854	This is also the same zombie just flipped.
5347014	5353176	That or someone just flat-out stole from someone else, which would also be hilarious if it didn't end up being Resident Evil at this point.
5353596	5360159	But there's another image or whatever that says, you know, stay alert, stay alive, report symptoms.
5360599	5362960	And it has a Biohazard logo on it.
5363000	5364520	So, you know, Biohazard, Resident Evil.
5365501	5366281	It's not a stretch.
5366321	5366961	I mean, come on.
5367741	5370022	Sequel to successful game franchise?
5370282	5370863	No.
5372923	5373304	So, yeah.
5373804	5376285	Expect a new Resident Evil game to be announced.
5378106	5379127	Um, it's kind of fun.
5379567	5399827	With the new firmware that came out for, or I should say the new dashboard for the Xbox 360, there was a new, they were calling it the AP 2.5 protection that was supposed to flag consoles as being banned, or flag them if you were playing a burnt game or whatever on modified drives.
5400307	5400587	Well...
5401588	5408671	Apparently, not, what, a couple weeks after the firmware or the new dashboard came out, they have already found a way around it.
5409171	5412272	And they've actually come it over forever.
5412752	5424436	The custom firmware group has released new firmwares for iXtreme LT+, for Lino and BenQ drives for the Xbox 360.
5424937	5425417	It allows...
5426838	5435151	It says, Defeats current AP-25 protection, protects consoles from logging AP-25 violations, full disc stealth, and yadda yadda yadda.
5435451	5437875	Basically, it means that they've found a way past their
5439640	5444782	New, uh, I don't know if it's supposed to be undefeatable, but, um, new copy protection.
5445183	5446483	Didn't take very long, so.
5447424	5447904	Interesting.
5447924	5462791	Um, and then, finally, and this is kind of neat, uh, we were talking a little bit about, I should say, uh, Rob was talking about how he likes Super Meat Boy, and I was asking him about, um, you know, the internets, uh, t-internets.
5463391	5464292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5485686	5486326	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5509891	5517398	and also two non-character specific DLC packs will arrive via internets in December.
5518139	5529850	Meat Boy, a retro chapter based on the best of Meat Boy Flash prototype and iMeat Boy, a pack of remixed levels from the main game made more difficult.
5530070	5530530	Yes, that's right.
5530550	5534174	They're taking levels from the game and making them even more difficult than they were.
5534694	5537596	They already have the Dark World and the Light World.
5537616	5539757	Well, now they're even more difficult.
5539817	5540998	Darker World or what?
5541038	5550164	Like, yeah, every level in the game, if you get an A+, meaning you clear it under the par time, then there's a Dark World version that's just even meaner.
5550764	5555147	Because some of those levels, like the Light World levels, like, some of them were really hard.
5555167	5556968	Like, I almost cried.
5558905	5561087	Just ask SalaciousPop, he laughed the whole time.
5561667	5565731	And Rob, I guess to internets, I'm trying to see how you would access them.
5565791	5570515	It says there's a level called to internets.
5570635	5580823	It's a world that can and will be automatically updated with free level packs using the title managed storage system.
5581824	5583565	I probably just haven't dug around enough in the game.
5583585	5584505	There's a lot in there.
5584525	5590748	Yeah, but they have this cool little path or whatever that they have, a bunch of different levels.
5590988	5594229	Yeah, most of the worlds have that, but it looks like the background's a little different.
5594269	5599391	I wonder if there's warp zones and stuff, too, because some of the warp zone retro stuff is the hilarious stuff.
5599671	5600011	Yeah.
5600051	5603733	DarkToicAk in our chatroom says, I'm sorry, but Super Meat Boy really sounds like a porno.
5603993	5605273	Oh, that's what it is?
5605313	5606194	Like, it...
5607614	5614019	It's the worst title and some of the worst cover art I've ever seen, but the game is amazing.
5614039	5617702	To get the internets, you have to obtain 20 bandages.
5619463	5620984	Oh, I'm really terrible, you guys.
5621024	5622465	I have like four bandages.
5623046	5623947	So I'll work on that.
5624907	5625368	That makes sense.
5625428	5627189	Alfred Cananogram is echoing that in the chatroom.
5627209	5628050	Alright, I'll work on that.
5628090	5629190	I'll work on getting 20 bandages.
5629551	5631332	Guys, it is a really hard game, okay?
5631572	5632713	That's all I'm saying.
5633755	5634695	DJ Tiesto 3 Track Pack for DJ Hero 2
5657462	5658202	DJ Hero 2 DLC sounds like...
5688072	5689373	I think electronic music is very cool.
5689433	5690593	I don't want to hear the guy talking.
5690654	5691894	I just wanted to hear some music.
5692234	5693435	So, there you go.
5693495	5696817	The DJ Hero one is a little bit harder to find.
5697337	5707103	I believe it's mycookrewards.com slash rewards slash dj-hero- I have TFs spelled wrong.
5707483	5715225	DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto DJ Tisto
5737429	5737930	Well, fuck.
5739011	5741973	TigerClaw wanted to know what songs for Tiesto.
5742354	5744056	Traffic mixed with Louder Than Boom.
5744676	5747939	The Feel It In My Bones song he did with Tegan and Sarah, which I actually really like that song.
5747959	5748420	It's a cool song.
5748780	5751663	And Knock You Out featuring Emily Haynes mixed with Young Lions.
5751923	5752624	Those are the songs.
5757790	5761754	Bulletproof Heart, Helena, Teenagers, and Welcome to the Black Parade.
5761834	5765439	And they will become paid DLC once that expires.
5765799	5770765	So even if you don't own the game, just download, get the code, and then that way you have it for when you do buy the game.
5772369	5780480	Those are actually songs that I would really like because I've got the ones that they did for Rock Band and I wanted more.
5780540	5782102	Helena is such a great song.
5782202	5783264	It'd be really fun to have.
5784969	5786410	Now, going on to another news story.
5786590	5790132	I am so confused by this next story.
5790172	5791213	This is just so crazy.
5791273	5792854	Alright, Game Room, right?
5793434	5798417	It was kind of neat when it first came out, and then the games that have been released for it have been kind of bleh.
5798777	5804080	And then, you know, Chrome has been having problems, and so we've all just kind of written off Game Room, right?
5804480	5807862	Well, did you hear what games came out on Game Room this week?
5808042	5809923	If you missed it, Game Pack 12 has...
5811064	5833958	The arcade version of Blades of Steel Trick Trap 1771 Pitfall 2 on the Atari 2600 Which by the way is my favorite 2600 game ever made And the Intellivision's Vectron Now some of the game room people You can go in on the PC version and kind of see what games are going to be coming out soon Get this, you know what else is in the pack?
5834778	5839321	Amidar, Food Fight, Puyan, Sunset Riders
5839921	5843363	from Konami, and DarkSakura, Twinbee is in this pack.
5844344	5844664	Right?
5845385	5849268	So, I'm sitting here going, you're putting this out now?
5849828	5852710	You waited until now to give us this stuff?
5852850	5856573	Like, when everybody was declaring, ah, Game Room's a bore.
5856933	5859775	You waited until now to whip out Sunset Riders.
5860956	5861356	Twinbee!
5861934	5863236	and, yeah, Twinby, whatever.
5863396	5863856	TWINBY!
5865218	5868762	Like, I don't even understand the idea behind that or what.
5868782	5869843	That's, oh my gosh.
5870143	5871245	And Blades of Steel?
5871785	5873868	Like, the best hockey game ever made?
5875630	5880275	Arcade version, nonetheless, which I bet a lot of people haven't even played because we all just remember the NES version.
5882099	5886901	Yeah, so if you haven't been on Game Room in a while, now you have reason to go check it out again.
5886941	5887721	Like, seriously.
5888342	5890663	Surely one of those games made you go, what, what, what?
5891043	5893304	And yeah, the pricing is still the same.
5893804	5895705	It's what, $3 on one platform?
5896105	5896545	$5 on both?
5897946	5898386	Crazy.
5899133	5900734	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5925100	5926381	I have to leave on Tuesday morning.
5926722	5927422	Ah, shit.
5927963	5932626	If I didn't have this whole work thing tomorrow, I'd be like, I'm bringing Dance Central over and we're playing Whoop, there it is.
5933387	5936930	Come down for Tron, you can crash on my floor.
5937670	5938931	I wish I could make it work.
5938951	5939732	We'll see, we'll see.
5939752	5941954	You can sleep in Chris's gamer chair.
5942274	5943855	And then Black Eyed Peas.
5943875	5945156	The one that makes the creepy noises.
5945396	5949319	Yeah, it makes creepy noises at night when the temperature changes.
5950780	5951401	It's haunted chair.
5951972	5955436	If you actually like the Black Eyed Peas, I Got a Feelin' is coming out.
5956317	5960141	David Guetta did kind of help with that track and he's cool, so I'll give it that.
5960922	5962744	There you go, that's your Dance Central DLC.
5963264	5963825	DarkSakura?
5964847	5966869	Well, we have some other stuff.
5967709	5980019	For the consoles, there is on Capcom's official Japanese language blog, there are screens of Yun and Yang in their arranged costumes.
5980599	5986764	So instead of their little kind of street-y looking fun outfits, they are dressed as a chef and a waiter.
5988105	5991267	And, yeah, chef and a waiter.
5992395	5993215	So that should be cool.
5993735	5998257	Apparently there's going to be achievements open for both of the characters as well.
5998617	6004579	And rumors of an evil Ryu, a grain of salt territory, and some other stuff.
6005860	6016963	Also, for those waiting for Otomedius Excellent, it's not going to be out until... Looks like spring 2011, not fall 2010 like they originally said.
6019624	6023207	So they say it's a delay in production.
6024347	6026049	More games getting delayed.
6026729	6027410	Same story every week.
6027430	6028370	I hope it's for a good reason.
6028390	6029631	I hope it's for a good reason.
6030211	6036896	And finally, Doctor Who Mazes of Time will be out for the iPhone and iPad.
6038684	6039945	Actually for the holiday season.
6040225	6043347	I hope that's going to be in the US as well.
6044028	6054674	But basically, it's being put out by Tag that's done other apps for different Channel 4 shows in the UK.
6055155	6056836	Come Dine With Me and Peep Show.
6058657	6060338	So, maybe that'll be cool.
6061770	6067097	Alright, are we ready to get to some Twitter topics and get to the tweets that people have been tweeting us all night?
6067117	6067478	We ready?
6067658	6068259	Yes, let's.
6068319	6074186	We already know that it's a great Twitter tonight because of the whole Jetpack Cat thing that's been going on, so very excited about that.
6075388	6076750	Yes, we did start a new hashtag.
6076770	6077671	We're hoping you'll catch on.
6077731	6079253	Alright, anyhow, for now...
6080575	6082076	I don't even know if I've heard of that second game.
6082096	6083017	Donkey Kong Country Returns, not yet.
6083037	6085799	The second one's kind of a little bit like that last Guardian game.
6085839	6087160	You have this kind of golem...
6105897	6106798	Thank you for watching!
6119355	6122716	Sorry, I'm looking at a little... Wow, that's really stylistic.
6122736	6125578	Is that on an arcade or is that like an actual retail game?
6125818	6126518	That's a retail game.
6126958	6128399	That looks kind of awesome, actually.
6129559	6130940	The problem is these games are $60.
6131520	6132100	You know what I mean?
6132560	6133021	That game is $40.
6133421	6134361	Really?
6134821	6135021	Yes.
6135241	6136482	This actually looks kind of awesome.
6138363	6140283	And if you shopped on Amazon, you could have gotten it for $30.
6140564	6141144	Really?
6141264	6141544	Really?
6143359	6143519	M.A.J.I.N.
6154457	6156298	Donkey Kong Returns, I'm kind of like, eh.
6156839	6161021	My Wii is still in a box, and this game does not really motivate me to get it out of the box.
6161181	6162782	You put your Wii in a box?
6163002	6164083	My Wii in a box?
6165964	6171828	All right, Spazinator PSN says, if I can get through tonight on the phone, I'll call in giving a mini review of Voodoo on the PS3.
6172068	6172748	What's Voodoo?
6173209	6173909	V-U-D-U?
6174069	6175910	It's a movie streaming service.
6176971	6177611	Oh, I didn't know that.
6177992	6180033	Oh, okay, so it's like a Netflix competitor type thing?
6182975	6200338	something like that I guess now here's why I like having a live chat room because when we're sitting here going I don't know the game I've never played the game our chatters help fill in the gaps here so Miklatov in our chat room says Donkey Kong Returns is hard as hell and Solar Flare says Donkey Kong Returns is only fun with a group of friends and booze there you go
6202287	6208128	Deathwishing says Rob should dust off his PS3 because Konami Space on Home has DDR in it.
6209169	6212229	So they brought DDR to PlayStation Home now, I guess?
6212970	6213650	I'll look at it.
6214030	6216090	I haven't played the PS3 in a while, but I'll take a look.
6216550	6220691	It's not that I hate the PS3, it's just there haven't been a lot of games on it I've been wanting to check out.
6220791	6223032	And is 3D.GameHeroes worth a buy?
6223732	6225933	Yes, if you like the Zelda games, yes.
6226033	6228154	Although this game is a lot harder than the Zelda games.
6228795	6235278	If you're a video game nerd, which you probably are if you're listening to this show, there's lots of video game nerd references all over the game.
6235818	6237959	And it's very Zelda-like.
6238860	6240400	And you can probably find that stuff on sale.
6240440	6242842	I mean, it was only $30 originally when it came out, right?
6243362	6247144	So now you can probably find it for like $15 or $20 and it's absolutely worth it at that price.
6247604	6250205	The only drawback, it's not a very long game once you know what you're doing.
6250225	6251746	You'll probably beat it in like six hours.
6252507	6252667	So...
6253547	6254248	Something to consider.
6254448	6256250	I would say if you can find it on sale, absolutely.
6256290	6256850	Don't pass it up.
6259172	6262515	Moving on to some other tweets.
6262635	6265057	Some people are venting that they weren't able to listen to OLR.
6266619	6266959	Sorry.
6268480	6272724	DJ Ranma S says, I had a problem with three of the titles.
6276227	6281833	I'm not even going to look at this and I'm going to tell you they're probably trying to just create controversy to get page hits.
6282154	6282534	Period.
6282774	6286639	They want people to dig this and what have you and just get more page hits.
6287359	6293666	It's probably not really accurate but I'm going to look now and see what they came up with.
6293726	6294848	So again, this is a link from
6295308	6317704	DJ Ranma S on Twitter, it's IGN's top 10 worst games of 2010, and he says he has a problem with three of these titles, number 10, Sonic the 4, Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the 4, Sonic the Hedgehog 4, episode 1, I can see where that's landing on people's lists, it was a bit of a disappointment for a lot of people, number 9, the PlayStation Move, see, that's not even really a game,
6320605	6322066	8.
6321486	6322066	Lost Planet 2 7.
6323848	6325530	Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Days 6.
6327292	6330916	Crackdown 2 Would you say that was one of the 10 worst games of the year, Loki?
6331196	6334880	It's not the worst game, but it was definitely a disappointment compared to the last one.
6335120	6337463	But it's not... I wouldn't say that's the worst game.
6337483	6339245	That's not even a bad game, really.
6340703	6342904	Number five, Microsoft Connect.
6343344	6344125	Oh, fuck off.
6344165	6348267	It's too early to tell if Connect is... They gave it a good review, even.
6348727	6350728	No, that's just... It's for page hits.
6350748	6355110	This is why you do not read corporate media websites.
6355651	6358492	I mean, this is a... Anyhow.
6358992	6360333	Four, Fable 3.
6362094	6363475	I've been hearing raves about Fable 3.
6363535	6365476	They gave it good reviews also.
6366696	6368017	Number three, Medal of Honor.
6370145	6371647	2.
6370246	6371647	Gran Turismo 5 1.
6374609	6378071	Final Fantasy XIII Fuck off!
6378131	6381633	How can you put XIII on the list and not XIV?
6382534	6386036	Your opinion is invalid, person that wrote this article.
6386156	6389199	Is that even an article or is that a blog post?
6389719	6390980	I stopped caring.
6391040	6393181	It's a piece of poop.
6393682	6394462	It's just a joke.
6394502	6395363	Who gives a crap?
6396471	6399873	I don't know, it says slash articles.
6399893	6401534	It doesn't say blog.
6401594	6402514	No, it says editor.
6402614	6404856	There's some dude that has an editor badge or whatever.
6405216	6405656	Great.
6405916	6406757	That's awesome.
6407137	6407437	Fail.
6409045	6410866	Yeah, I'm reading some comments in our chat room.
6410986	6412127	IGN equals fail.
6412307	6414048	IGN equals we need more hits.
6414729	6417550	I bet FFXII is worse than Final Fantasy XIII.
6417590	6419431	That's what you get for reading IGN.
6419832	6420372	There you go.
6420432	6420932	Enough said.
6421673	6422013	All right.
6423314	6424875	Tigerclaw sends us some links.
6424915	6425755	He sent us a few.
6425795	6427076	I don't know which ones to read.
6427637	6430839	Oh, I like this one, and this didn't make our show tonight, and I remember reading this.
6431399	6432420	Tigerclaw sends us this link.
6432860	6434241	Actor Billy Bob Thornton...
6436002	6441606	Speaking of people that need to fuck off, blames video games for the death of quality in Hollywood.
6445528	6452933	Here's some lovely quotes from Billy Bob Thornton, because when I want an expert on video games, I think, I wonder what Billy Bob Thornton thinks.
6453273	6457436	I even actually have a sticker that says, WWBBTD
6460603	6472387	I just like the word lovely and Billy Bob Thornton going together Says the man who used to wear a vial of blood around his neck Why are game blogs even reporting what this asshole has to say?
6472848	6474488	Why is he fucking relevant?
6474648	6476909	Why are we not talking more about Jetpack Cat?
6476949	6478790	Why are we not more talking about her boobs?
6478870	6484152	They're right here in the studio and yet I'm talking about some dickhead Billy Bob Thornton story
6485973	6487375	Hey, it's where every gamer has a voice.
6487415	6488456	That's the stuff they tweeted us.
6488476	6490858	Next in all games radio, Marissa's tits.
6493201	6496364	What we need is Jetpack Cat to bounce off your boobies.
6497025	6498607	Meow, meow, meow, meow.
6498767	6504894	Oh, the boyfriend every morning comes up to me and he does the cat paw thing on the cleavage, you know, like when they're adjusting to get into bed.
6505094	6505354	Uh-huh.
6505815	6506996	Just bump, bump, bump, bump.
6510455	6514296	They're geared towards the video game playing generation.
6514736	6523900	And these video games, which I'm on my sum about constantly, these games are people killing for fun and I think traditionally in movies there's always been some kind of lesson in the violent movies.
6524540	6535844	By the way, his next picture is called Faster and it stars Dwayne The Rock Johnson as an ex-convict on a quest for revenge against the people who set him up in which the actor plays a flawed cop.
6538294	6539937	Oh, and by the way, he goes on a killing spree.
6540278	6543083	Not the cop, but you know.
6544827	6548728	Penalizing users of big breasts Penalizing users of big breasts
6572078	6600298	I think I'll also penalize players for making female characters with large breasts by applying common sense to that too oh this must be from like a role playing blog so like if you're gonna make a female character with big boobies just so that she can have big boobies this DM wants to have decreased maximum stamina stamina drains faster and you can't wear some sizes of torso armor have you ever found Marissa that there's certain torso armor you're unable to wear because I somehow doubt that
6600874	6601634	I have torso armor.
6601755	6603395	Actually, Rob.
6603796	6603996	What?
6604536	6615722	I played D&D once and if we were to we would actually have to roll for fitting sometimes for certain armors depending on different stats.
6616703	6617203	I'm serious.
6618344	6624687	He would actually say if you're going to be extra especially for the guys who would play female characters and would make them that busty.
6625067	6629290	Yes, I have been at many a D&D game where guys have played women.
6630070	6630831	Oh, right.
6630931	6632172	Yeah, they were too busty.
6632553	6636817	Yeah, they'd actually roll sizes for armor and then make them get a different class.
6638739	6642943	He was very nitpicky, but I've been at real tabletop games where they've done that.
6643359	6644401	Thanks for watching!
6660203	6662906	So I played the one lesbian.
6663006	6667630	I decided to play the very stereotypical man-hating lesbian because it was high school.
6667730	6669132	We're all stupid-ass kids.
6669592	6670453	So it was fun.
6670593	6671054	It was a lot of fun.
6671074	6672175	I always threatened to kick their ass.
6672275	6673516	It was good times.
6675035	6678417	I mean, I have boob armor in the Uta's brassier's Nazi bras.
6679237	6681198	So, I think I've told that story before.
6681238	6682159	I still love that.
6683639	6684900	I may do that for Dan.
6685480	6686581	Because Dan hadn't heard it.
6686681	6689442	By the way, the name is pronounced and he's in chat, so sorry about that.
6689622	6691143	Majinamikon.
6691383	6692124	Majinamikon.
6693623	6695505	Oh, like Necronomicon, but Maginomicon.
6695585	6696825	Yes.
6696925	6697266	Let's see.
6697326	6701388	We've got other stories from Tigerclaw.
6701408	6703150	I wanted to read at least one other one of these here.
6703190	6705611	How about the Kinect being hacked into a Super Mario Bros.
6705691	6706692	emulator controller?
6707272	6708833	Yes, somebody has hacked their Kinect.
6709334	6712836	There's this whole little video here of some dude on YouTube playing.
6712916	6715238	Oh, it's that same guy I saw in a video last week.
6715938	6721482	He hacked his Kinect, and he's actually running to the right and left and jumping to jump.
6721522	6722723	That's actually kind of cool.
6723804	6725445	When he jumps, Mario jumps.
6726606	6729148	And when he goes to the right side, the character moves right.
6729228	6730489	When he goes to the left side, the character moves left.
6731490	6732391	Okay, neat.
6733532	6736375	They're starting to get a little craftier with these Kinect add-ons.
6736495	6738417	So, you go, guy.
6738957	6742660	His name on YouTube, if you want to look at the video yourself, YankeeYan.
6743001	6745203	Y-A-N-K-E-Y-A-N.
6745763	6746243	Check that out.
6747424	6749346	You can see him kind of like doing the Mario Brothers dance.
6749406	6750127	It's a lot of fun there.
6750878	6752179	Mario.
6754441	6760506	One more tweet from DarkKisuke sends us, is AC Brotherhood amazing but pretty buggy?
6760826	6764209	I don't see a link with that, but has anyone played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood?
6764269	6765670	I've heard really good things about it.
6765691	6768973	A lot of my guildies in WoW are like, can't play WoW right now.
6769013	6770434	I'm playing Assassin's Creed.
6770474	6770915	Sorry.
6771595	6773556	So I sadly have not played the game myself.
6774036	6776998	But, gee, another console game being bugged on release.
6777478	6778399	What a surprise.
6779179	6780439	What a big surprise.
6782280	6783741	That's going to do it for Twitters this week.
6783781	6786783	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets for next week.
6787563	6789284	Meanwhile, back into some gaming news.
6789344	6789584	Loki.
6791057	6794140	Um, so yeah, there's some other interesting stuff.
6794581	6805712	This is kind of neat because the game came out so long ago, but apparently now Axl Rose is suing Activision over the inclusion of Slash in Guitar Hero 3.
6806693	6809095	Apparently, they're saying that, um...
6810800	6827756	They filed a $20 million lawsuit against the publisher for associating Guns N' Roses music, specifically Welcome to the Jungle, with the former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash and his new band Velvet Revolver in 2007's Guitar Hero 3 Legends Rock.
6828357	6828617	It says,
6835803	6845146	Broke its contract with Rose by including imagery of Slash in the game and offering music by Velvet Revolver as downloadable content.
6845786	6854248	It says the juxtaposition exploits the prior association between Slash and Guns N' Roses and promotes Slash and Velvet Revolver.
6854369	6855769	Separate interest includes...
6856810	6867327	VR tracks as available downloads, all of which was and is indirectly contrary to the contractual obligations of the defendants.
6867868	6868829	That's a query in the filing.
6869671	6869811	And...
6872079	6872740	Let's see.
6873400	6875382	How were sales of Chinese Democracy?
6875462	6876443	Just out of curiosity.
6876503	6878724	That album that took, what, like 10 years to make?
6879765	6880426	I have no idea.
6880666	6882708	Is he being a bitter Betty?
6882868	6885470	Because I think Axl Rose is being a bitter Betty.
6886431	6886871	It says...
6888352	6900154	Apparently, there's a comment, Activision's EVP of Music Affairs, Tim Riley, is quoted as saying, Come on, Beta, you can't believe everything you read on the internet.
6900294	6915417	In response to rumors of Slash's inclusion, heard by Rose's rep, Beta Labase, I guess, whether Rose's claims of treachery on Activision's part turn out to be true or not, that remains to be determined.
6916007	6919791	Oh, we actually have another comment that's coming in right now over email from Activision.
6919831	6921213	Official comment on this whole piece.
6921573	6922894	Quote, fuck you, Rose.
6923876	6924336	What do you know?
6924656	6925097	There it is.
6925177	6927179	It's more of Axl Rose being an ass.
6927660	6929862	It's Axl Rose being Axl Rose, actually.
6930603	6932965	Well, it sounds like here that, well, I don't know.
6933005	6933486	They said that
6936329	6940152	It's just weird, like, a lot of these losses, I guess, take a really long time, maybe?
6940212	6944175	I mean, because they're on, what, Guitar Hero... It'd be the equivalent of Guitar Hero, like, 6?
6944395	6945796	Yeah, this is about Guitar Hero 3.
6945876	6946516	Yeah.
6946956	6957243	Well, I mean, if Slash actually has songwriting credit on that song, I don't know how legitimate that claim could really be, because, you know, he's allowed to be represented as a musician, unless they make him not exist.
6957423	6962807	Here's the thing, is it's not really saying, you know... It's just...
6964468	6973840	Just because Slash is in the game, I understand that people would associate Slash maybe with Guns N' Roses, but he's kind of moved on now.
6973920	6979286	Just because there's a Guns N' Roses song in there and Slash is in there doesn't necessarily mean that
6981525	6981945	I don't know.
6981985	6983446	You can hire a lawyer to say anything.
6983726	6985587	I think of Slash as independent at this point.
6985607	6988748	I don't necessarily associate Slash strictly with Guns N' Roses.
6988808	6993530	I associate Slash with that kind of like fro-y, hairy thing he has.
6993690	6995451	It's not even really like a fro though.
6995471	7000273	He just has beautiful hair you just want to run your fingers through even though you know it's a wig.
7000533	7004995	What exactly is wrong with associating all that stuff anyways?
7005015	7008057	What kind of damages were actually caused to Guns N' Roses?
7008097	7009097	I think Guitar Hero 3
7011078	7014905	You know, arguably was probably a pretty good game, I mean, at the time.
7015587	7015747	And...
7018326	7020208	I don't think it's really negative for them.
7020248	7023531	I mean, didn't they have Chinese democracy as download content?
7023771	7024232	I love this.
7024672	7028716	As J100Matt says, well, you know what they say, every rose has its thorn up its ass.
7029336	7032099	Giovedea, I love this.
7032519	7034581	Also, it's a guitar game.
7034981	7037283	Who is the guitar player in the band?
7038785	7041948	I mean, that's just what Activision should take to court right there.
7042048	7043109	Giovedea should be a lawyer.
7044049	7044610	There you go.
7045809	7047672	Ah, whatever.
7048533	7049334	Whatever, dude.
7050014	7052137	I also love the comment here from Deathwishing.
7052157	7056722	It was a while ago, but at chat.orange.com Axel Rose needs money for cocaine and blow.
7057063	7059125	Yeah, that's what it's come to.
7060146	7064452	Well, let's move on to something happy, bouncy, fun, and talk about Virtual Console.
7064972	7065573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7084082	7099331	Lufia and the Fortress of Doom and Lufia 2 Rise of the Sinistrals those were all very recent trademarks that were applied for that means that these games could be coming out on virtual console very soon usually that is what this ends this kind of ends up meaning
7100011	7104475	Just so you know, Daria's twin was actually released on the Japan version earlier this year.
7105455	7109178	Lufia, I don't think, has been released just yet, but it looks like it might be.
7109599	7112521	Well, hooray for Virtual Console actually getting some new content.
7112541	7114082	That's got to be exciting for them, right?
7114302	7114983	Good games, too.
7115303	7115643	Uh-huh.
7116284	7116664	There you go.
7117464	7119266	No, not Daria's twin.
7119986	7120167	No.
7120207	7121848	Marissa, that's not Daria's twin.
7122568	7123009	Just so you know.
7125551	7125891	All right.
7126211	7127312	DarkSakura, what do you have?
7127948	7128889	Thanks for watching!
7148540	7168663	um anyway Julius is uh has the extra long whip that can work as a grappling hook and Yoko has uh magic which definitely goes back to the old games so that's pretty cool um so let's just hope that it improves the game some all right
7169983	7170203	No!
7171305	7171585	No!
7187843	7188664	Actually, you're wrong.
7188744	7189945	The answer is yes.
7190265	7195068	Apparently there is an extremely realistic racing simulator called iRacing.
7196269	7199911	No, it's not for the iPod or iPad.
7200812	7207176	Apparently the top driver won $10,000 despite never driving over 100 miles an hour in real life.
7207856	7214824	TopGear put him into an actual race car to see if the digital skills translate into real racing prowess.
7215564	7219348	Apparently, he did pretty well.
7219769	7225155	He clocked in a lap time 3 seconds off of what an experienced driver would be expected to deliver.
7226295	7234960	Of course, they say three seconds is an eternity in motorsports, but, you know, considering this is his very first time, it's pretty awesome.
7235420	7240042	His braking points were spot on, and he seemed firm and precise on the throttle.
7240502	7253189	And in the fastest corner, he's entering 100 miles an hour compared to an experienced driver's 110 miles an hour, a sign of absolute confidence and natural feel for grip, as Top Gear wrote.
7254089	7261511	and so apparently, I guess, you know, training on a really, I mean, it kind of makes sense.
7261551	7271754	If you're training on a game that's an extreme simulation of the real thing, it's almost like doing the real thing since it's a simulation of that.
7271994	7273074	But can you change a tire?
7274835	7275095	Okay.
7275115	7277116	That's not the driver's job, okay?
7277256	7279496	That's what your pit crew is for.
7279516	7281697	Right, it just takes down sexiness points, that's all I'm saying.
7281717	7281797	Okay.
7282645	7291894	My only worry is that, you see, I look at this and go, well hold on though, just because I play Microsoft Flight Simulator or whatever they're calling it now, Microsoft Flight, doesn't mean I can fly a plane.
7292374	7293615	But we should see if you can.
7293635	7294596	No, we shouldn't.
7294876	7296638	No, they have simulators for that.
7297279	7297559	I just...
7297859	7301321	But see, my thought is that it's supposed to work the other way around.
7301521	7312488	If I know how to fly a plane, then Microsoft Flight Simulator is supposed to be a way for me to kind of like, I don't know, I guess practice without practicing or sort of like relive that experience from the comfort of my own home.
7312508	7316831	But Rob, you're saying that if I'm good at an arcade game, I can't go fight off an alien race?
7317111	7320073	You know, I believe that is what I'm saying, yes, actually.
7320093	7321314	That's not...
7322154	7323336	I don't wanna live in that world.
7324717	7326119	I think you do, I'm sorry.
7337191	7348818	You can sense the gravity movement within the car itself, and when it needs something... I mean, I know this isn't a regular driving simulation, but still, drivers get an intuition about their own car, with all the moving parts and everything.
7348838	7355222	Of course, with the simulators that I play, I'd need an Uzi, and I'd be firing at the back of their car, and destroying their tires.
7355823	7359925	Does the simulator simulate the G-forces and all that stuff, too, though?
7359965	7360185	No, see...
7361406	7363128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7379742	7380743	No, it's not that at all.
7380803	7393057	It's just saying that, you know, you're just not, you haven't experienced those G-forces and stuff and the physical toll of driving that fast, you know, you have to compensate for that.
7393217	7398063	And if you can't do that with a simulator, then you're not really ready for the real thing.
7398459	7402480	For the record though, I mean, most 16-year-olds drive like they learned on Grand Theft Auto anyway, so.
7403961	7404421	True.
7405241	7407962	There's some real dipshit drivers out there on the road.
7408102	7409002	Watch out for my sisters.
7409022	7410543	How did you get a license?
7410623	7411143	Jesus.
7411723	7412003	All right.
7412384	7414244	Anyhow, how about a story about Tron?
7414304	7415104	Yes, Tron.
7415144	7415885	We heart Tron.
7416985	7421146	Which, by the way, the Tron soundtrack is out around the internets.
7421547	7421847	Got it.
7423067	7424668	Thanks for watching!
7443223	7454735	So the PC, the PS3, and the 360 versions of the game, they will actually include codes that will allow you to unlock some additional multiplayer maps and a character skin that is basically Sam Flynn.
7455195	7461422	So I guess think of that as your whole encouragement to not buy the game used, some additional maps and the code and all that.
7462163	7464505	Yes, but that's some of the downloadable Day 1 DLC.
7465706	7473031	So at least they're not charging you to play the game online if it's a used copy, but yeah, only with the new copy are you going to get some of this extra stuff.
7473151	7475733	And that's usually the way publishers do it.
7475773	7480416	They don't pull this dick-ass move like EA or, you know, THQ.
7481016	7495346	EA at least will, you know, give you a trial, and it's only really with their sports games, so if, you know, you want to play online, I mean, most of the sports games you're probably buying new anyways, but like THQ with their martial arts games and stuff,
7496847	7498109	It's just a dick move.
7498169	7498809	I'm sorry.
7499230	7501092	Sorry, no trial whatsoever.
7501112	7503595	You have to pay money up front if you don't buy this game.
7503715	7504155	I'm new.
7505757	7515807	Alright, well we're going to open up the mailbag at mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com and dive into the email bag and DarkSakura is going to go in and pull out some emails and read them for us.
7516568	7517108	Just two.
7517809	7518889	Just two?
7519390	7521071	One says, non-credible rumor.
7521851	7522151	Okay.
7522311	7524993	Just a silly rumor I may or may not have heard.
7525573	7532157	Chayark may be doing a side project to bring casual gamers to Star Trek Online, allowing players to establish a Klingon salon.
7532497	7534999	The first salon to be set up, Modern Warfare.
7537853	7539854	I'm gonna guess this is just a joke, DarkSakura.
7539874	7540435	Yes, it is.
7540495	7541115	That's what I said.
7542376	7547459	And a congratulations to our winner of our Castlevania Symphony of the Night code.
7549200	7549921	It goes to Mike.
7551082	7551842	And enjoy it.
7552522	7553163	You are quite welcome.
7553183	7555164	He says, oh my gosh, thank you so much.
7555624	7556325	I love you guys.
7556405	7556685	Heart.
7556765	7557105	Smile.
7557346	7559787	There's probably like a hundred guys named Mike that listen to this show.
7559847	7561268	Well, this Mike who won.
7561848	7562149	Okay.
7562369	7563049	Mike who won.
7563510	7564050	Mike who won.
7564090	7565051	That's now your last name.
7565091	7565631	Mike who won.
7568186	7568807	The winner is you.
7568947	7569307	That's it?
7569888	7570248	That's it.
7570328	7572871	We've had some kind of like not very full mail times lately.
7572891	7573632	Turkey coma.
7573652	7573873	I guess.
7573893	7574253	Turkey coma.
7574693	7577777	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.
7578077	7579819	You really need to fill her up for next week.
7579899	7582462	Like I want part B to be nothing but DarkSakura reading emails.
7583243	7583564	That'd be fun.
7583584	7584224	Do it and die.
7585846	7586207	All right.
7587588	7588810	Well, let's do the FUs of the week then.
7605218	7611366	Um, F you to, uh, money and my lack thereof.
7611626	7614269	I want my severance check, do you hear me, you bastards?
7616352	7618294	But... They might if you bang a little louder.
7618935	7622179	But I am glad to be free of that horrid, horrid place.
7623741	7623981	Okay.
7627391	7636596	I have to say, Nephew, too, the fact that this week is actually a regular week and not a short week like last week was.
7638077	7638437	I don't know.
7638757	7640178	I get spoiled by the short weeks.
7640758	7641418	It's awesome.
7641979	7647842	But, yeah, Nephew the Roundtable for forgetting to put my order in when I ordered it.
7647862	7652764	That's why I call ahead, you know, because if I wanted it not ready, I would just go in and order it.
7653264	7655866	But, you know, that's technicality, I guess.
7657912	7659753	I don't really have a lot to be angsty about right now.
7659833	7661314	Things are pretty good all things considered.
7661354	7664756	I'll just say F you to the fact that I had a nice long weekend and it's over.
7665176	7667897	Oh, F you to the fact that I stayed up until 4 in the morning last night.
7667937	7668878	That really wasn't smart.
7668898	7673020	Because I have to get up at 4 in the morning on Thursday to catch a flight to Burbank.
7673440	7674921	So that really wasn't smart of me.
7675821	7676281	Just saying.
7678082	7679783	Marissa, do you have any FUs you want to throw out there?
7679963	7680843	Maybe you have some angst?
7681003	7684564	It's my shock, anyone who knows me, but I'm not mad at anything right now.
7684924	7687705	I guess FUs are not being able to stay out here long enough.
7688205	7689646	But I'm having a great time, so thank you.
7690206	7693567	Well, you're on vacation, so it's hard to give an FU.
7693707	7700889	If I'm in Hawaii and I'm full of FUs, if it's not about some bitch stewardess or bad hotel service, I'm really kind of a dick.
7700949	7701349	Oh, you know what?
7701369	7702009	I do have an FU.
7702069	7705690	I have an FU to the fact that I always have to fly on screaming baby airlines.
7708532	7709332	Thank you for flying.
7728266	7730467	I love how the stewardesses just don't care anymore.
7730587	7731647	Like, do you want peanuts?
7732808	7734508	You want to have some peanuts?
7735188	7742550	The thing that pisses me off is that I used to be neurotic about signing on 24 hours in advance so I could get the A1 boarding pass.
7743170	7747932	But now they got smart and they sell like 1 through 30 for an additional 10 bucks.
7748272	7753093	So I could be the first one on at like, you know, 24 hours before and I'll have like B1 to board.
7753613	7755194	And like that is soul crushing.
7756044	7773256	I used to have to do that for my boss, she was always flying southwest of here to my work for a law firm, and yeah, she was completely anal retentive about that, but the funniest thing now is that, I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but I said maybe like if you're a B and it's really obvious, and now they have the standing in the number order.
7773996	7775537	Don't give a shit.
7775557	7776457	They just take you.
7776537	7778158	You don't have to stand.
7778358	7779799	You can stand at 16 if you're number 50.
7780119	7780719	They don't care.
7781660	7782120	Right, yeah.
7782160	7783360	It's not exact.
7783380	7786002	But you definitely have those people that are like, Oh, excuse me.
7786122	7790164	I believe you need to be on this side of the sign because you're holding that number.
7790984	7794085	You just put your hand over that part where you're holding it.
7794205	7796306	I know.
7797107	7801509	So yeah, although I didn't have to get scanner molested, which was nice because I was not going to offer that picture.
7802116	7802836	Thanks for watching!
7821588	7827574	and like, it wasn't the part that they were taking the picture that bothered me, but they were just being such jerks.
7827654	7830016	Like, you need to put your hands up, sir!
7830317	7834160	It's like, give someone a badge and it just gives them the right to be a total asshole, you know?
7834220	7835081	It's like, God.
7835682	7841908	Learn customer, as someone who taught customer service for nine years, a lot of those security type people really bother me.
7842428	7852233	Yeah, they, actually, at least in my experience, they're really nice at Burbank, but, I mean, you talk about those image scanners, I mean, there's plenty of images that have already shown up on the internet, okay?
7852693	7859397	You take a scan of somebody that has gigantic boobs, or a big wing, or something unusual on your body, they don't get paid enough to be professional, I'm sorry.
7859657	7866961	They're totally gonna be like, hey guys, look at this, check this out, and, you know, like I said, I'll opt for the pat-down.
7867561	7875069	and, I mean, unlike anyone, you know, over 14 nowadays, I actually haven't, that picture of me from the site is, like, the dirtiest thing of me I'll find dry.
7875309	7875529	Right.
7875549	7885819	Um, but, um, but yeah, I'll offer the pat down, and my professor was saying in my law class that, um, that they even check your cleavage, and now I'm like, great, this'll take two days.
7885960	7886280	Shit.
7887721	7890183	I better get the hard hat on in the canary.
7890303	7890824	You know what?
7890884	7895687	My cleavage is like, you know that bag in Mary Poppins where she just pulls out stuff?
7895707	7897809	I can plug a lamp out of my cleavage.
7900411	7903974	She has an umbrella with a parrot head that talks to her in her boobs.
7903994	7904974	Yes, exactly.
7905675	7907096	So, airports are fun.
7907516	7909037	I don't mind having the nudie pictures taken.
7909117	7910697	It's faster.
7910997	7912018	Sit here and memorize it.
7912378	7914699	You should just strike a pose.
7915419	7922042	One of my friends when we were at the airport, when we went to Boston for PAX East, funny enough, she got picked for the random screening.
7922262	7923982	Because then it was not everybody did it.
7924002	7924763	It was just random.
7924803	7926143	I don't know if maybe it's still that way now.
7926203	7928704	So I didn't have to do it, but Amanda had to do it.
7928824	7930385	And she was excited.
7930445	7932306	She's like, I get to do the nudie picture.
7932326	7932626	Yay!
7933846	7940469	So she's like running over there and she like totally does this pose where she has her hands up and she's like, dude, this is because she's fucking adorable to begin with.
7940509	7943210	And then she does this whole like little like pose thing when she's standing there.
7943230	7947652	And I'm just like, you are having way too much fun with the nudie picture.
7947773	7954816	I like the people that have the idea of doing the the spinal tap thing and having a cucumber wrapped in a wrap and foil in your pants.
7955496	7957617	So, you can always spinal tap it.
7957938	7959939	Oh, boy.
7959999	7962821	Can you technically bring a cucumber wrapped in foil along?
7962861	7965102	Well, they'd find it in the scanner, but you cannot.
7965903	7966983	As they did in spinal tap.
7967003	7967964	Sorry, that was lunch.
7970025	7971686	I needed something to suck on on the plane.
7974668	7975789	Anyhow, let's move on.
7977850	7979071	Hey, more stories for you guys.
7979091	7982195	Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7982595	7986659	As if this show couldn't go any further down the toilet, we're about to open it up to callers.
7986679	7989142	1-877-GAME-OLR.
7989182	7989743	But not just yet.
7989763	7991024	We still have a couple more stories for you guys.
7991840	7994142	Yeah, this is kind of neat.
7994642	8006532	Apparently EA Tiburon is rumored to be in early development for a new NFL Blitz because, hey, Midway sucked it up with that series and Warner didn't do too much better.
8007112	8012437	So now they're going to give it a new shot since, hey, NBA Jam did all right.
8013117	8016440	So, I don't know, NFL Blitz could be kind of fun.
8016540	8017521	I liked NFL Blitz.
8018242	8020166	I still haven't played any NBA Jam yet, though.
8020647	8022811	At least the new one.
8024074	8025697	But they say it probably won't arrive until 2012.
8025877	8029044	So, it's a rumor for now.
8032296	8034037	Alright, I like rumors, I guess.
8034117	8039058	NFL Blitz is kind of cool, so it'll be interesting if that's coming back as well as NBA Jam did earlier this year.
8039398	8042799	I'm sorry, I'm just distracted by a link that was posted in chat by SolarFlare.
8042819	8043579	Is it a fig leaf?
8043839	8056983	Yes, I guess you can buy panties or boxer briefs or whatever that have a giant fig leaf on them that are made of some type of radiation-proof material, so when they scan you, the little fig leaf will come up.
8057023	8058843	It must be for bras, too.
8059163	8060244	Oh, you can get the hands for the bras.
8060264	8060404	Yes.
8062305	8074919	Like the Barbra Streisand dress Or I don't know if you've seen Burlesque yet but there's definitely a nod to that Has it been a hot mess of glitz and glam?
8075818	8078701	I did see Burlesque this week, the day after Thanksgiving.
8078741	8083585	Actually, no, I saw it on Thanksgiving, and it was very, very, very gay.
8084365	8085707	It was Cher the best.
8085727	8088129	People were complaining that it wasn't hot mess enough.
8088509	8089870	That's what I heard.
8090711	8098117	Look, if you're going to go see Burlesque, and you're going to go see a movie starring Cher and Christina Aguilera, you ought to know exactly what you're going to get.
8098357	8099578	And the movie does deliver.
8099618	8101340	You get exactly that.
8101940	8122501	but I'm just saying it's it's it's a movie starring Cher I mean there's you know if this is for you or not like there's no surprise here I would not recommend Loki go see this unless maybe he wants to check out there are some scantily clad women but they don't ever deliver on the actual I know I was saying where's the real burlesque with the pasties
8123442	8124803	Yeah, no, they don't do any of that.
8125403	8129066	It is kind of like, it's watered down burlesque a little bit.
8129146	8136150	But then there's that part of me, it's like, but Cher is a fucking fierce, fierce bitch, and she steals every scene she's in.
8136370	8137131	Every scene Cher is in.
8137151	8139692	Is it like an extended Lady Marmalade video?
8139912	8141693	Yeah, that's fair, that's fair.
8142214	8144075	But with Cher, and she's made of awesome, so...
8144435	8148276	And I know a lot of the listeners probably don't want to hear this, but we'll have girl talk here for a minute.
8148296	8152097	I will say the guy that plays Christina Aguilera's love interest in the movie is smoking hot.
8152898	8153918	Smoking hot.
8154058	8158600	He kind of reminded me of the previews of a young Cary Elwes, but he's aged weird, so.
8158800	8159080	Yes.
8159280	8159840	Oh, yeah.
8159880	8160920	He was so cute back in the day.
8160960	8165462	I saw Cary Elwes in a preview for Saw 3D, and I was like, oh, wow.
8166842	8167323	Wow.
8167343	8168363	He's back in that?
8168644	8168904	Yeah.
8171286	8173707	I don't really like to follow the Saw movies from what I understand.
8173767	8176850	They bring him back as part of a... Flashback film?
8176970	8180492	No, people who've all survived the games from prior.
8180533	8182074	But he didn't survive.
8182394	8182734	I don't know.
8182754	8183074	Whatever.
8184616	8187218	Chat wants to know, was it better or worse than Showgirls?
8190959	8192241	On a scale of 1 to Showgirls?
8209461	8211143	It's not really any surprises.
8211203	8217209	But if you're just going to have fun and just not really think for a couple hours, it's good for that.
8217469	8221353	I just heard people complaining that they want it to be showgirls era hot mess.
8221373	8222754	No, it's not that much of a hot mess.
8222794	8225076	To keep it on the gamer topic, what about Burlesque the game?
8226438	8229661	Well, I'd like to see that on Xbox Connect, actually.
8230181	8231663	Actually, I'd have to shake your titties.
8231783	8233725	No, I'm kidding.
8234467	8239344	You know that somebody's going to come up with something like a concerted connect thing specifically for that.
8240911	8241912	Oh, hey, back to video games.
8241972	8242692	I do have one more.
8242712	8247436	Hey, actually, funny enough, this is about the boobs and Kinect.
8247476	8250658	So maybe they could use this in a burlesque-type game.
8250998	8256943	But the Xbox 360's Kinect, it can track the head, it can track the hands, but now it can track the breasts.
8257583	8262647	That's right, this is Dan Wilcox actually hacked the Kinect to see if it could spot his chest.
8263027	8269212	And what happens is that the computer is looking for his man boobs and draws a bra or pasties on top.
8269232	8269692	Ha ha ha ha!
8270112	8272576	and music plays when titties are detected.
8273057	8284733	So sure enough, there's this little video called the Connect Titty Tracker and the guy's moving back and forth and like it draws a little bra on his chest.
8289877	8294078	I look for a person-sized blob and use its centroid to approximate a search box wherein to detect two boobs.
8318024	8325546	So I don't know if it would work on women yet, but we haven't seen that video, or at least it's not appropriate to be on family websites.
8325626	8325967	I don't know.
8326887	8327587	But there you go.
8327827	8330128	The Connect can now officially track your movies.
8334569	8336490	You are just giggling way too much, Rob.
8336530	8337930	Like a little girl.
8337950	8341231	There's so much stupid shit on tonight's show.
8341271	8342052	Like, really?
8344975	8345415	I love it.
8346076	8348117	Alright, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.
8349258	8350659	Let's just take it from bad to worse.
8350719	8353161	Let's open up the Skype line.
8353181	8357844	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
8357924	8359905	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8360005	8361586	Or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8361646	8362207	Give us a call.
8362227	8362687	We'll talk.
8364465	8367166	Hi, this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator, did you call in to talk about boobs?
8394853	8397634	Well, that wasn't even my intention, but sure, why not?
8399895	8401135	They're always relevant.
8401195	8402856	What did you call in to talk about tonight?
8404296	8414560	Well, as I had mentioned on Twitter, and you had turned red earlier in the show, I was going to call out about...
8415680	8424506	That new Voodoo service over on PlayStation Network Oh yes, tell us a little bit about Voodoo Because I'm not very familiar with it What's up with Voodoo?
8426088	8444681	Well, as far as I know, it's a relatively new service I think it was started by either Walmart or Best Buy Or one of those big retail chains Basically, they're equivalent to the PlayStation Network video store
8448251	8472695	basically you can rent or buy movies from their service kind of like what you can do from PlayStation Network and plus it has full Twitter and Facebook integration on that and not only that but you know here's kind of a
8474332	8488004	Unusual interface to it, or at least unusual compared to, say, the Xbox video marketplace and compared to PlayStation Network.
8489085	8492948	Now, it has a multi-page menu to it where
8494175	8521790	It'll give you a whole bunch of information regarding the movie like a plot summary Oops, sorry, I'm on the website and it started a video I hate this fucking autoplay shit Sorry, I was on the Voodoo website trying to educate myself but it started an autoplay video Well, basically it has a multi-page menu to it where it'll tell you all about the movie who made it, who's in it, plot summary so on and so forth, even the
8523004	8530989	The box art to the movie, like what you would see on DVD or Blu-ray, whatever.
8531830	8536553	Now, there is an interface thing on it.
8537093	8538554	I love the interface.
8539355	8547960	It's a whole lot better than PlayStation Network and Microsoft's service.
8549321	8550002	And plus, you know,
8550854	8555638	with their videos, you know, you can even get 5.1 surround sound on the videos.
8556198	8557980	So, okay, so it has a very pretty interface.
8558020	8559601	Does it cost money to use it?
8560782	8577015	Yeah, it's basically, you know, you pay actual dollars and cents to rent or buy the movie just like you would for Blockbuster video or Hollywood video or anywhere else.
8577315	8579257	You know,
8579858	8586503	Unlike where, you know, unlike Netflix where you got like, you know, one flat fee, rent everything.
8586723	8588984	Now you pay per movie on Vudu.
8589305	8589505	All right.
8589545	8591486	Well, you know what I find interesting?
8591566	8593047	Vudu, I'm reading about it.
8593107	8595209	They were just recently bought by Walmart.
8595729	8598851	So it's the Walmart movie company now, although they're still called Vudu.
8598971	8600092	It's actually owned by Walmart.
8600472	8604675	So I hope they don't go in and edit movies like they do CDs that get sold in the stores.
8604775	8605776	That would be disappointing.
8607732	8630947	and the thing is with the Voodoo app over on PlayStation Network they actually give you the first rental free everything else after that you know you have to pay for so does that mean everybody can go get one free movie just by like signing up yep the only thing you gotta do is put in like an email address well yeah but everybody has an email address they send all their spam to so that'll work
8632168	8632328	Yeah.
8632908	8636350	Now, there's a couple minor downsides to it.
8637950	8640291	Well, even... No, I should... Wait, wait, wait.
8640311	8641111	I gotta say something.
8641131	8641392	Hold on.
8641412	8642332	This is very interesting.
8642352	8642692	I'm sorry.
8642752	8647394	Voodoo apparently at one point actually would rent adult titles.
8647834	8659218	But on February 25th, to comply with the policies of its parent company, Voodoo discontinued operating the AVN After Dark channel, which had the adult movies on it.
8660339	8660439	Aww.
8660899	8670543	Now see, it's a bummer they didn't keep that open, because I've been saying this for the longest time, whoever brings us the porno first is going to win this video on demand war.
8670643	8677266	So if Voodoo had done it, man, nobody would even be talking about Hulu, because Voodoo has the titties.
8680407	8690011	Yeah, despite all the things I do like about the Voodoo service, there's a couple things I don't like about it, which are kind of major issues.
8691125	8697767	First of all, you can't download any videos that you rent or buy locally to your hard drive.
8697947	8698967	You have to stream it.
8700108	8707330	And combine that with the fact that you have to be logged into PlayStation Network while you're viewing the movies.
8707970	8714772	So if, God forbid, for whatever reason, your internet goes out or whatever, basically you're SOL.
8715792	8720053	And not only that, but I have
8722056	8749277	as a side note, a really fast internet connection roughly about 20 megabits per second and even with that and having every other device turned off like my 360 and PSP and so forth when I rented the really high quality HDD expendables with 5.1 surround sound the movie was constantly stuttering, trying to buffer
8750160	8773569	and what not and that shouldn't happen because I have a fast internet service and not only that but it seems like every minute and a half to two minutes it literally would stop streaming out the gallery saying oh yeah we can't there's some kind of network problem
8774412	8776574	If you're willing to deal with a few headaches, go ahead and try it.
8776594	8777294	There's a free rental.
8777354	8777534	But
8803797	8807719	No, I wouldn't actually pay money out of pocket for it, though.
8808159	8809280	Alright, there you have it.
8809580	8811221	Spazinator, thanks for the review on Voodoo.
8811801	8813342	We're going to let you go so we can get more calls.
8814463	8815163	Alright, have a good one.
8815223	8816104	Alright, have a good one.
8816224	8816444	Later.
8817597	8825920	Alright, it's a bummer he missed out on all the pornography, but I guess that was the pre-PlayStation 3 era or something, IDK.
8825940	8831022	1877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8832923	8842086	By the way, some kind of late-breaking news here, I guess I can go ahead and say this, it's not really a secret, Loki was successfully able to get a hold of the Techno Kitten Adventure guys, so we're going to
8842586	8844027	We're going to see when he's available.
8844047	8846269	He says he's available Sundays.
8846469	8848491	As soon as next week, we'll try to get him.
8848891	8849812	That's astounding.
8850812	8851633	I'm so excited.
8852073	8852834	Alright, more calls.
8853755	8854675	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8854695	8855036	Who's this?
8856236	8857317	It's Deathwishing.
8857618	8858418	Deathwishing.
8858498	8859379	What is on your mind, my friend?
8861176	8868245	Well, first of all, I want to say that this episode has made me laugh very hard for returning back after, like, I don't know how many months I lost track.
8868325	8872850	I know, I was going to say, we haven't heard from you in a little while, so I'm glad we are still once in a while funny.
8872950	8873511	That's good to know.
8876794	8879277	Well, I want to say you need to get on PlayStation Home.
8879317	8880619	A lot has changed.
8880990	8883951	Okay, tell me why I need to get on PlayStation Home.
8884452	8888994	I got an email from them the other day, like, come visit us and see what's changed.
8889034	8892935	And I just kind of wrote it off as... They did a 3D.
8893015	8895016	I think they have 3D support on some stuff.
8895036	8896097	I don't know if something's loaded.
8896117	8897637	I'm not sure if it's just a little icon thing.
8897938	8899158	3D, like it's a 3D item.
8899178	8900159	Okay, well, I don't have a 3D device.
8900179	8901059	There's a DDR room.
8901159	8903860	There's that DDR room I've been talking about on the chat room all night long.
8903960	8904981	Okay, what's the DDR room?
8905001	8909423	Do I actually get to play actual DDR or do I get to watch my avatar stomp on a fake machine?
8909443	8909783	You go...
8910143	8912964	You go into the Konami penthouse.
8913204	8916225	Yes, a penthouse because I guess Konami thinks you're like players or something.
8916365	8920507	And you go out there and there's a Konami points and it's integrated with Facebook too.
8920707	8924428	Your Konami points will be on Facebook if you download the Facebook leaderboards app.
8924588	8926969	I can spam on my friends via home?
8927029	8927650	Yay!
8928390	8929710	Just like a Facebook game.
8930591	8936493	But now you go out there and there's a dance floor of all these people with their really messed up avatars.
8936912	8939754	Guys dressed up as the PlayStation Move dildo thing, whatever.
8939874	8945278	And you can go out there and every now and then there's a group dance-off and then a dance-off item.
8945318	8946499	And it's actual DDR.
8946519	8950642	You play, it's like, you know, you press the buttons up, down, left, right on your D-pad.
8950722	8953704	I don't know if they have support for the pad, someone could confirm that for me.
8954284	8955965	When they have it and you do it, they earn points.
8957286	8962750	It's pretty cool, but I have yet to win a match because I'm white.
8964662	8970585	Well, just because you recommended it, sir, I will make it a point to check it out this week and see what's going on.
8971205	8972045	A lot different.
8972085	8973646	There's a lot of different stuff to it.
8973786	8976187	Well, what else besides just the Konami space?
8976247	8976727	So we get it.
8976747	8977688	There's DDR in there now.
8977728	8979269	What else is available?
8980509	8981750	There's a park.
8981930	8982950	What am I trying to say?
8982970	8986452	You missed out on some Thanksgiving event with chasing turkeys.
8987745	8989326	Could people dress up as turkeys?
8989346	8992307	Because I remember one of their big events was the furry event.
8992347	8994808	You chase the turkeys around and you could get a turkey costume.
8998309	9004031	I swear, Home doesn't even try to hide that it's catering to the furries.
9004171	9006512	It really doesn't try to hide it at all.
9007093	9013475	Well, you know they actually have costumes now that you could dress up as a cat or a bulldog or stuff like that.
9020818	9026384	I think the people that need to know that already know it.
9026444	9028446	Can I do anything with the OLR club now?
9031250	9031850	I'm not sure.
9032571	9034453	I kind of canceled my join request because I...
9035851	9037632	I know, we got full!
9037732	9043815	We can only hold 25 people, and by some miracle of God, there's more than that that want to join.
9044015	9046217	Ooh, if that's true, then I'll go add more people.
9046237	9048998	Hold on, I gotta send a video of DDR and PlayStation Home.
9049899	9051860	This looks fucking stupid.
9051900	9054641	It's just all these people moving around on a dance club.
9054701	9056102	Let me see if this gets interesting at all.
9056562	9057763	Oh, hold on, I turned the audio off.
9063157	9064758	And it has the whole, like, chibi music.
9065219	9067020	Oh, a group dance-off is starting.
9067960	9070102	That looks like any douchebaggy club on Sunset.
9071383	9081510	Well, you'll have to pay $10 to get in there and get stared at by a bouncer, so... Wow, it is kind of DDR at home, I'll give it that.
9081550	9082471	That's... okay.
9083692	9084613	It's just kind of interesting.
9084633	9085673	It's a little minigame, you know?
9085994	9088715	Something to do on home, because there's really not much to do on home.
9088735	9090637	Why does the guy have, like, landing flares?
9094219	9096761	I want to get in the costume and go dancing home like this.
9097041	9100083	Why am I not seeing, like, a single pedo bear on the dance floor?
9100243	9101224	That's what I want to know.
9102544	9106327	I saw some dude dressed up as, like, Mr. Muscle Man up there with his pedo on.
9108638	9109998	I was just like I was at a rave.
9110018	9111539	Pants on the ground.
9111559	9112159	Pants on the ground.
9112719	9113199	They're DDRing too.
9113219	9114240	Pants on the ground.
9141477	9148020	So yeah, anything else in home besides pants on the ground and turning into a turkey?
9149160	9154662	Actually, if your pants could go on the ground, home would probably be a lot more popular with a certain crowd.
9154682	9159344	Midway, which is like that one place on the pier, whatever that place is.
9159844	9163526	You can play carnival games there and earn prizes.
9164346	9165847	It's still a standard home affair.
9166693	9168414	and I don't see how it's still open beta.
9168454	9169736	It's been open beta forever.
9169816	9171677	It's just like Gmail's been in beta.
9171917	9174760	Actually, I think Gmail finally came out of beta like five years later.
9174780	9179363	I think it's just like they put it there open beta just to say it's going to grow.
9179403	9181905	It's just a constant reminder that they don't owe you shit.
9182206	9187410	That's really... The beta tag being on there so long is really just a reminder like we don't owe this to you.
9187430	9188951	There's actually some clothing that costs $15.
9189592	9191273	Like, no joke.
9191293	9191273	$15?
9191853	9193695	It's a golden suit.
9194035	9194495	What is it?
9194556	9195937	It's a golden suit and it rains money.
9196650	9197677	The Birthday Suit
9202847	9204228	Hold on, I'm googling this right now.
9204248	9205869	$15 home suit.
9207049	9212092	My character, which I haven't logged on to home in forever, still looks like a hobo Santa Claus.
9212112	9214274	I was going to say, didn't you buy the Santa Claus outfit?
9214314	9216035	That is the only outfit I will be wearing.
9216055	9217195	You are a dumbass.
9217275	9220397	I don't know why you spent actual money on that.
9220417	9223059	I have a character I made, but I have like two characters I made.
9223139	9230403	One looks like I somehow got punched in the jaw by Mike Tyson, so it looks like it's chint and that's unbelievable strength.
9232037	9235640	I'm actually looking here on the... We can hear you typing over there, hun.
9236020	9237962	It should be a golden suit.
9238382	9238883	Yeah, I'm looking.
9238963	9246649	I got linked to a GameFAQs thread where they're saying that the gold suit is located inside the store made out of gold.
9246709	9247449	Who would have thought?
9248190	9250111	No one told me it dispenses money when you wear it.
9250212	9250832	I has a want.
9250872	9252714	It's in a store called Exclusives.
9252914	9254835	You go in there and have exclusive items.
9254875	9257437	And I want the really exclusive item because it rains money.
9258058	9258838	You have to have $15 to buy it.
9259890	9262591	We can walk around the home and be like, hey guys, check out my pixels.
9262971	9267673	It actually rains down your money so your bank account gets drained even faster.
9268833	9270814	I don't understand.
9271454	9274395	Alright, but if that's what you're into, then hooray.
9274455	9277996	Alright, I will check out home this week, I promise, but we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls.
9278016	9279416	We wanna get at least one more call in, okay?
9279537	9281917	Shout out to Mass San Francisco.
9282778	9283298	What's that?
9284398	9285178	Is that a rave?
9285318	9286479	It's your bike club.
9288677	9289778	Okay, should I go?
9289978	9291219	I go to San Francisco all the time.
9292420	9295102	No, you have to be kind of a hipster.
9295182	9295882	I don't think you're a hipster.
9296063	9296823	Oh, I don't have a Tumblr.
9296923	9297243	All right.
9298244	9298725	Have a good one.
9300946	9301246	All right.
9301266	9304709	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9304809	9305449	Use the name on Skype.
9305469	9307591	It's Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

9315777	9316017	Hello?
9318500	9318880	Hello?
9319201	9319461	Hi?
9321302	9325044	It sounds like the microphone got lost under a pile of dirty laundry.
9325244	9325584	Hello?
9326545	9326845	Hi!
9326925	9327625	Hello?
9327705	9328026	Hello?
9328166	9328726	Hi, who's this?
9330187	9330547	Nathan.
9330727	9331548	Hey, Nathan!
9331808	9332908	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9332928	9333609	What's on your mind, buddy?
9336170	9336530	Nathan.
9337711	9340112	Yes, Nathan, yes, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9342454	9344095	That was like Space Age sounding.
9344115	9346456	Yeah, do you have a question, Nathan?
9348800	9354203	Yes, is this an Xbox?
9354483	9355244	Run that by me again?
9356564	9358205	Did he ask, is this an Xbox?
9358365	9359766	No, this is not an Xbox, sir.
9359806	9361127	It's an internet radio program.
9365049	9365809	I can't handle it.
9365849	9366290	I can't hear.
9366430	9366990	I'm sorry.
9368011	9368451	I can't.
9368571	9368911	I can't.
9369491	9371332	Echo 123 before you give us a call on Skype.
9371392	9372393	Make sure your connection works.
9372473	9372753	Echo 123.
9374768	9375889	Did I hear that wrong?
9375929	9379791	I thought I heard... I think his mic started cutting off.
9379811	9383714	I think it was like, you know, something about on Xbox, something, something.
9384254	9384554	All right.
9385115	9387496	Well... Or is like Xbox, blah, blah, blah.
9387636	9387796	Yeah.
9388016	9389297	Try again next week.
9390178	9390518	All right.
9392499	9393940	1877GAMEOLR, username on Skype.
9394901	9395801	Orange Lounge Radio.
9395821	9397922	Do you have any last-minute stories, Loki, before we get to another call?
9398843	9400544	Oh, we have another call coming in right now, so forget it.
9400604	9401385	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9401405	9401625	Who's this?
9402847	9407349	True, yeah, hello there, you American things over there.
9407769	9409790	It's that one, Swede Akeripper.
9409910	9412431	Fuck yes, I was hoping that a Swede would call us tonight.
9412471	9413091	What's on your mind?
9414752	9419814	Well, I could finally talk about Sims 3 that I've been playing since it came out.
9420274	9422775	Sims 3 that you've been playing since it came out.
9422835	9423536	What's up about Sims 3?
9423576	9425036	No, no, no.
9425957	9426717	Modification.
9427197	9428378	The expansion.
9429298	9429919	The expansion.
9429939	9430379	Late Night.
9431260	9432140	Ah, Sims 3 Late Night.
9432480	9434221	What happened to DarkSakura in Sims 3?
9434281	9435222	That's what I want to know.
9435242	9437563	I haven't heard DarkSakura talk about Sims 3 in a long time.
9437583	9441826	Like, she used to be like... Because I have to reinstall all of my stuff so I can use my mods again.
9442766	9443887	You have to get on that, miss.
9444447	9444787	I know.
9445048	9446368	Rob, I'm in school.
9446608	9447109	I'm busy.
9448369	9450611	All right, well, Aki River's going to tell us all about the expansion then.
9451711	9454353	Yeah, well, the expansion is, as usual, really nice.
9457610	9467555	But the whole thing is that, well, the celebrity thing is a bit stupid, as one can be expected.
9467715	9474598	But the vampire thing is kind of like meh, almost, in some way.
9475278	9483582	But what are the... Well, the kind of like good thing is that, well, we finally have...
9484167	9493715	Penthouse and such and apartments which is kind of good in one way if you're having a small Sims family.
9494196	9495557	So you can get a penthouse, huh?
9495617	9497238	Alright, I'm liking where this is going.
9497598	9499740	Do you get to get a $15 gold suit?
9501922	9502583	No, you can't.
9502703	9503123	Not yet.
9504925	9505685	Alright.
9505725	9507767	Do they do anything else besides just like items?
9507807	9510910	Are there new like game modes or new things in your Sims experience?
9511430	9512251	Oh, um...
9513522	9521165	What are their new skills?
9521965	9529367	Oh yeah, the new music stuff is kind of cool once you get the hang of it.
9531088	9542932	And one of the annoying parts about vampires that really frustrates me like hell is that if you have vampire children, they can skill up
9545852	9551056	Hold on, hold on.
9552417	9554658	Hold on, back up, rewind, press pause.
9555019	9557801	You can be a vampire now in The Sims?
9558021	9558421	Yeah.
9559802	9560263	Can you sparkle?
9560283	9566067	Yeah, so you can, well, be all that series.
9566287	9567308	Do you get to sparkle?
9567408	9569049	Is this like Twilight vampires?
9570770	9572792	No, no, it's not exactly like that.
9573214	9574496	Oh, thank God.
9574557	9575538	They don't sparkle.
9575799	9576380	Oh, thank God.
9576700	9577923	So they're not Mormon vampires.
9579626	9579926	Yeah.
9580106	9580347	Okay.
9580607	9584194	There are vampires, but there aren't any werewolves, so it's not...
9586460	9608679	So it's not 100% Twilight Well that's a relief, thank god So you can do more like, I don't know, Dark Shadows As opposed to Because like Dark Shadows, cool vampires Twilight, not cool vampires Big difference Barnabas, awesome R. Pattinson, not awesome
9610166	9633503	Oh yeah, but one of the kind of like cool is that you can actually build your own swimming pool within a few stories up of sorts.
9633724	9635645	Before you couldn't actually build a pool.
9637669	9641312	Yes, I could drown people on a roof.
9643594	9651702	Wait, can you torture the vampires by, like, putting them in sunlight or, like, you know, putting a bunch of garlic in the kitchen?
9651742	9654705	That's really, like, fun because vampires here can't...
9659577	9672560	Be in the twilight, be in the sun that often, but if you do, you will get this, oh, can't stand too much sun, and they, like, um, oh, how do you say it, though?
9672940	9678742	They, um, they, uh, oh, they lose their heads, of course.
9680082	9683203	So, it's quite hilarious.
9683343	9685223	I haven't killed anyone yet doing that.
9685563	9687884	Torturing Sims is the whole reason to play Sims.
9687904	9688984	You need to get on that.
9690009	9716868	yeah alright well Aki Ripper let's try to wrap up here is the Sims 3 night time expansion a must have yeah it is and oh and let's not forget there is actually some nice very very very very nice clothing for your Sims do we mean lack of clothing or like actual clothing actual clothing in this one
9718531	9719011	Thanks for watching!
9737509	9740710	Won't see any pixels, but you won't see anything anyway, so.
9741610	9742951	They're just Sims, people.
9743131	9743591	All right.
9744071	9751634	All right, Aki Ripper, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for calling in to talk about the Sims, and please torture some Twilight vampires for us.
9752594	9753815	Yeah, I will.
9754055	9754355	All right.
9755055	9755495	Later, buddy.
9758550	9759891	Was he swearing in Swedish at the end?
9759931	9762792	He probably was.
9762953	9763633	Alright.
9763833	9765894	He was casting a voodoo hex on us in Swedish.
9765934	9767315	He'd be saying, die American scum.
9768936	9769536	Exactly.
9770177	9771898	And I'm just like, ooh, I love ABBA, yay!
9771918	9772078	Alright.
9774219	9776101	Anyhow, that's going to do it for the calls tonight.
9776161	9778423	Sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through, but we've got to wrap things up.
9778483	9782507	It's almost midnight on the East Coast, so at 9 o'clock here, and I've got to have tacos.
9782527	9789793	So we're going to wrap things up, but quickly, Loki has not really had an opportunity to do the rest of the last-minute story, so I want to see if... Yeah, I don't really care either.
9791254	9792415	Would you have anything you want to get out there?
9792596	9792756	No.
9793877	9794798	Well, fine.
9795498	9796319	See if I care.
9797819	9798399	That's it then.
9798900	9799300	We're done.
9799380	9799900	We're out of here.
9800260	9801721	I was seeing if there was any last things.
9801901	9802941	I can do one thing.
9803001	9803882	Oh, changed our minds.
9804222	9804722	Yeah, one thing.
9805563	9818789	The game Ilo Milo, I guess it's not out yet, at least on Xbox Live Arcade, but there is a way you can get to play it and actually be... It's a way of promoting the game virally, I guess.
9819549	9831201	and it is out for free on Windows Phone 7 devices but on Xbox Live Arcade there is a way to download the demo which if you want to you can download the full game before it's released.
9832002	9835446	And to do that you go to the website which is...
9837588	9841552	WP7SuperSecretAccess.ilomilo.com
9851801	9857546	You should copy-paste that link in chat so our chatters can just click it and go get their game if they want.
9858047	9858507	Sounds like fun.
9859568	9860909	Of course, that's just the demo, though.
9860929	9868396	It's a demo, but you can buy the game through that so you can be playing the full game technically before it's released.
9868836	9869137	Alright.
9869457	9869797	Very nice.
9870805	9874926	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up the show for tonight.
9875146	9877026	Marissa, I want to thank you for being here.
9877146	9881767	I know you're not huge on the video games, but I still love having you on the show.
9881847	9885168	You laugh and validate our jokes, and I really appreciate that.
9885228	9888629	Because sometimes I think the jokes I say are so stupid.
9890069	9891249	I tune in every week, man.
9891429	9892410	I always have a good time.
9892490	9892910	Thank you.
9893330	9895310	That's a high compliment.
9895630	9898751	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight, or any last things you want to plug before you leave?
9898771	9898851	Yeah.
9899471	9900211	I don't know.
9902612	9908113	No, just thank you to everyone for entertaining me and apparently being entertained by my bosom.
9908833	9909994	This was a great time, thanks.
9910614	9911174	Please come back.
9911714	9912614	Thank you.
9912674	9914575	DarkSakura, who's got her headphones on over there.
9914615	9916135	She's jamming to something other than OLR.
9916195	9918416	I'm trying to figure out what my cage match song is.
9918556	9920276	Oh, you're worried about the post-OLR stuff.
9920296	9921597	You should talk to this one over here.
9922137	9922777	She has some ideas.
9923897	9924377	All right, anyway.
9924397	9926598	Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
9928606	9929646	Uh, words.
9930166	9931127	Happy birthday, Dan!
9931147	9938951	Uh, my final thought tonight is, um, I hope I, uh, get to bed before 4 a.m.
9938991	9939252	tonight.
9939552	9940072	That would be good.
9940452	9941273	Does that have to work tomorrow?
9941993	9943714	Uh, Loki, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
9945235	9946616	Um, I...
9947577	9952024	I want to put Christmas lights up in my tree, but my tree is very tall and my ladder is very short.
9952665	9953646	So that'll be interesting.
9954527	9955088	Good luck with that.
9955148	9955449	It was fun.
9955469	9961658	I had the MacGyver them up using a broomstick handle and a paint can opener.
9962760	9963020	Awesome.
9963820	9965121	All right, that's it.
9965141	9967041	We're going to wrap up for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.
9967061	9971603	Thank you guys so much for listening to our show, be it live here at All Games Radio or through the podcast feed.
9971643	9973984	We really appreciate it and your guys' support.
9974624	9978146	Next week on the show, more LOL game news and whatever comes up during the week.
9978206	9981887	Plus, we're going to try and track down the Techno Kitten Adventure guy.
9982288	9992712	Loki is an excellent stalker, apparently, and found the guy, so we're going to try to get him on within the next couple weeks and ask about the greatness that is that game and where we can get the soundtrack, absolutely.
9993052	9995093	So we'll have all that coming up in the next few weeks.
9995133	9997034	In the meantime, the show is free.
9997254	9999956	All we ask, tell a person or two about the show.
10000316	10005139	Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio because we do not have a big website backing us up.
10005459	10009181	We don't write bullshit top ten lists to get hits or anything like that.
10009581	10014444	We just rely on you guys and your friends to help us spread the word so we can slowly take over the world.
10014544	10014964	Sound good?
10015404	10018026	Alright, we'll be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
10018066	10019627	Until then, have a wonderful week.
