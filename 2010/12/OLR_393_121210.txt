Tonight, December 12, 2010, a high-profile PlayStation 3 game gets a big delay, Australia debates a new video game rating, and more rumors leak about the PSP2.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
For about three hours, give or take, every Sunday night we meet to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that stuff with you guys in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
My name is Rob Roberts.
I'll be joining you with my co-host Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
How are you?
Productive.
Productive.
That's good.
Productive Jamie is happy Jamie, right?
Sort of.
I'm being paid for it, so.
Hey, money!
Yay, money!
Yeah, and I'm going into finals week, so.
Good times.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, good luck with all that crap.
It's algebra.
Say hello.
Okay.
If 2X plus 9 equals Y, and forget it.
All right.
I could actually rewrite that 5 million different ways now.
Solve for kitten.
The answer is Shermie.
Can't divide by kitten, unfortunately.
Hi, Loki.
How are you?
Tech Master Loki joins us here every week with his witty insight.
How are you, Loki?
Good, and you can't divide by kitten.
It's like zero.
You can't mix the kitten with anti-kitten!
Not unless kitten is radical.
Oh, it's going to be one of those shows tonight.
It's just not going to make any sense at all.
Also, say hello.
We have some guests.
It's like pluralists in studio tonight.
And I'm going to introduce them here.
Since he has the mic, I will say hello to Salacious Pop.
Hello.
Hi, how are you?
I'm great, how are you?
I am well, thanks for asking.
except for the fact that, you know, it's Sunday night and then once this whole schtick is over, it's back to the work week, you know.
Yeah, and you have to be at work at like 7, 7.30 for a while now up until the holidays.
Yeah, and I'm just not a morning person.
You know, I really like my job, don't get me wrong, but it's just one of those like, you know, oh, getting used to the new schedules is really messing with me.
But, you know, it is what it is, so.
Ranma says if you divide by cat, you get kitten, but technically if you multiply two cat equals kitten, six kitten.
I can't even understand any of this.
All right.
So also say hello in studio.
We have another guest joining us tonight.
RKDN42.
Hello, my friend.
How are you doing?
Long time no see.
I haven't seen you since, I don't think you've been here since the marathon episode.
Yep, that's the last time I was in.
Which funny enough, Salacious Pop was here for too.
It's almost like a marathon show reunion.
No marathons, please.
No marathons.
Who wants to stay up until 4 a.m.
tonight?
Woo!
Yay!
I don't have a podcast to edit after the show, so I can do it.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
It's like New Year's Rockin' Eve.
All right, anyhow.
Let's see.
Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Actdeft in our chat room starts us off with this classy comment.
Salacious Pop, the occasional fourth host of the show.
I wonder if he sleeps with one of the hosts.
Actually, I always refer to the chat room as the ever-present fourth guest on the show.
So I think, Actdeft, you're implying that the entire chat room is, in fact, sleeping with one of the hosts.
I think is what he's really trying to say.
Slumber party!
Whoever falls asleep first gets their underwear thrown in the freezer.
Follow your dreams and never let anyone tell you that you cannot sleep your way to the paragon of independent video game journalism.
You put on your little black dress and you work it and you will be where I am now.
Believe in your dreams.
Yes.
I have to share something right now before I forget about it and before we get to our gaming weeks.
It's not something I need antibiotics for, is it?
This gorgeous piece of journalism, which I will take a picture of and show the chat room in a moment, is the American River Review 2011 edition.
I've done design in this.
It's $25.
Go buy one!
Why would anyone not in this area want one?
Because this thing wins like Uber awards.
We have people in Sweden that listen to this show.
Why should a Swedish person buy some community college?
Oh, recipes!
Fantastic literature.
It's a best of edition.
Fantastic art.
Fashion.
Oh my god, fashion?
I bet all of our gaming guys that listen to this show and they're teens that are between games of Call of Duty and Halo Reach are like, oh my god, fashion?
Where do I buy?
Some of the art in here is definitely nerd influenced.
Is there any video game reviews in there?
No, but there's lots of talk of video games in some of the stories.
Okay.
So obviously people, some of the writers are definite geeks, but it is a worthy purchase.
I will find the ordering information and post it somewhere so everyone can see.
But I've worked on this one.
And also, if you send me the money to get it for you, I will autograph it and get other people to autograph it and send it back to you so you can have an autographed copy.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
by awesome I mean amazing and it's really hard to take a picture of something black um I uh what nevermind what no that's inappropriate just don't take a picture of my penis then okay I went there I went there that was rumored to be a problem with the Kinect at one time
At any rate, I played a lot of Final Fantasy.
I played a lot of Star Trek Online.
They have completely redone Sector Space.
I was showing you guys the pictures.
Now you can actually turn off that little grid thing.
And when the grid is on, it's actually a lot less pronounced.
But then you can just fly around like you're in space.
And you have the little light trails as your ship moves, which people were complaining about.
Wait, light trails and grid?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
When you approach systems, it used to be that it would look like a little glowing model of a system, like you had in science class.
Now, it's you approach stars.
And as you get closer, it actually looks like a sun.
And the planets pop up around it.
And it's like you're actually approaching the system.
And only other turkeys will get this.
When you go to the Badlands, or to Little Nebula, or something...
When you approach it, it actually looks like a haze off in the distance and then you're in there.
Then when you actually enter the system or the area, then you're fully... Rob's pulling up the freaking... Well, Aisha, I was going to say that we have a clip of the soundtrack for the new Star Trek expansion.
No.
As you're flying through space?
No?
No.
Dave... You can't touch a rainbow or...
It looks like they've retextured some of the planets.
They've retextured the characters.
They've updated some stuff.
Earth Starbase has a basement now.
Ooh, fucking basement.
I also finally decided to make an Orion Slave Girl.
Running around in a bikini.
It's fantastic.
Apparently you can modify the Gorn now like anyone wants to play a giant freaking lizard.
Okay, I have to share this.
It has something to do with it.
There's my favorite Star Trek episode reviewer on YouTube.
It's SFDebris.
He's funny.
It's the highly opinionated Star Trek reviews.
And...
He was talking about Cisco winning.
They did one for Trials and Tribulations for DS9.
And talking about Cisco winning.
He could have talked to Kirk about all this other stuff.
Instead, he wanted to hear about the one time he porched a giant lizard in the nose.
Punched, I should say, not porched.
I wonder what a porch punch is.
This guy's reviews are fantastic.
It was Barry Waddle on purpose.
Maybe because Dork Von Weenie was already taken.
Arn Darvin, you see, is actually a Klingon.
Hey!
This guy's really funny.
Of course, he also said that the Defiant should have been named Ben Sisko's motherfucking pimp slap... Pimp hand!
Pimp slap hand, that was it.
Ben Sisko's motherfucking left pimp slap hand.
Welcome to the Star Trek Humor Podcast.
We have some really funny jokes for you today.
I have a really good zinger about Klingons.
Stay tuned.
Is this NPR?
Where am I?
Oh my god.
Talk of the nation.
Oh my god.
If I can finish with my story.
But at any rate.
They've made lots of changes for the better.
Still pissed off at Dabo.
Hololita's still annoying.
And that's really about it.
They've done a bunch of other retexturing, but really they've closed off.
The one thing I'm looking forward to is trying out the Foundry, which is you can create your own missions and then have other people go and play them.
You can put them up for other people to download and play.
so the good thing about that is that while maybe you've gone through all the major missions and everything is oh yay but you can actually go through and play new content that other people have created and that's really neat on the Tribble server they've got this thing to create new content which I haven't gotten to work yet but I'm going to look into that too the Tribble server is the playtest server
Okay.
Okay.
the last issue that the free expansion that City of Heroes put out was issue 14 the mission architect creator where you could create your own campaigns and that was the last expansion that Cryptic worked on so it sounds like they're doing something similar for Star Trek
Yeah.
Look at my boobs.
Just saying.
You can get a succubus with a warlock character and she'll show people her boobs and use a move called seduce.
Just saying.
Remember, my offer still stands.
If people want to pay for me to play World of Warcraft, I will.
Well,
I thought that was going to go in a different direction there.
Apparently the chat room likes my NPR voice.
So one of these days I'm going to have to just do an Orange Lounge Radio in all NPR voice.
Or you could just go listen to that Techno Kitten Adventure interview.
Hello, this is Terry Gross.
Today we're going to talk about...
Hello, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We have a hilarious interview coming up with Nick, the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure.
He'll be joining us to talk about his game.
And also, we'll be talking about USL Madness.
It's maddening.
And also, when Bob uses that voice, it sounds a lot like the Saturday Night Live sketch.
And then I expect to have Martha Stewart come out and make brownies.
Anyhow, Loki, how was your gaming week?
Please help.
My gaming week consisted of not much because, one, I didn't have internet, which is not really a big factor because I don't play online games at home.
At least not anymore.
And...
What else?
Basically, Grand Theft Auto at work.
Swords and Poker 2 on the iPod.
And I did try out Infinity Blade, which is all sorts of beautiful and actually plays pretty good.
So it's very neat what they can do on the iPod.
But yeah, that's pretty much it.
Didn't play a whole lot.
Let's go to our guests.
We'll see if our guests have anything exciting to share.
How about Salacious Pulp?
Only two games to talk about, really.
Maybe two and a half.
The half is Knights of the Crystals on Facebook.
Knights of the Clicky.
Knights of the Clicky, not really a game.
I gotta use all your action points.
You don't have to feed cows in it, so already it's good.
I forgot to spend my action points before coming to this show.
I'm pissed.
Damn it.
Oh well.
And if you buy the $50 worth of Square Enix points, that's the best value.
What a waste spending money on that game.
The items you get... Forget it.
Then Poker Night at the Inventory on Steam.
I've been...
Slowly unlocking, because I've definitely gotten better at the Texas Hold'em thing as I've been playing.
I've been unlocking the various tables and deck cards.
So it does have unlockables in it.
No new characters, but I have the Fruit Fucker card table and the Salmon Max.
Don't you mean the Fruit Friend?
Fruit Friend.
Fruit Friend card table and the Salmon Max deck of cards.
Is that what they're calling it in there?
Fruit Friend, yeah.
Okay.
Strong Bad Cracks Me Up the Most
I have to poke a little fun at it, come on.
For the longest time, we look like we're totally telltale biased, so I have to take an opportunity to poke this one where I can.
When the seg was on a couple weeks ago on the show, he was like, it's a very basic fan service game, don't expect it to be anything other than trying to take us down a couple notches on the hype.
That's true, that's true.
Yeah.
and then Cataclysm of course came out Monday night so I'm in deep home right now level no I'm about to start Oldham I'm level 83 haven't done any of the new level 1 content yet for any of the races I'm very much working on my main and you have a separate WoW podcast for all of that so that's all I'm going to say but it's out it's there
That's okay, I'm going to talk Cataclysm a little bit here.
Just because it's a huge, huge thing.
So it has to cross over a little bit.
Overall, I'm very amazed at how seamless the digital...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yes.
Oh, alright.
Okay.
What?
Yes, ma'am.
When I get back from Washington, I'll play for a month.
That's the spirit!
Hey, there's actually email coming up about how you can do that for free, so we're gonna get to that later.
I know you probably haven't peeked at the mailbag yet, but somebody who listens to the other show also listens to this one and sent a great tip, so we'll talk about that when we get to the mailbag.
First, though, we gotta finish off Gaming Weeks.
Arcadian42, I know you play a lot of... You have a pretty diverse lineup of games that you play, right?
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, and it's really a thumb killer too.
I got one of the new Xbox controllers.
I commented on it briefly that the D-pad's a little bit better.
I'm not sure if it's that much improved.
It might hurt your finger a little bit more than the original.
Interesting.
No, I forgot those had come out.
I knew they were on there.
I forgot that now's the season.
Interesting.
But it's nice having a better charge pack so that lasts longer than the older one.
Have you used that at all for Game Room?
I know you were big into Game Room for a little while.
I've barely gotten done into Game Room.
Have you heard about what's come out in Game Room?
Like, this week, I'm not even kidding, Twinbee and Datana Twinbee both hit Game Room this week.
And, like, Puyan.
All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Game Pack 12 was like, bam, bam, bam.
All these huge titles came out.
They're all Konami, but it's almost like...
Hey, why didn't you give us this shit like three months ago?
We might have paid more attention.
I think I downloaded those packs, but I haven't actually... Because they were taking a long time to download, so I went to some other game.
And the main game I've been playing this week is Resonance of Fate, which is a Trias game that Sega put out.
It's actually an RPG.
It's got an interesting battle system.
All the characters use guns.
and so they have different like they have like a machine gun and the other people have like guns and like thrown weapons like grenades so you level up by your weapon experience and basically you have to think strategically because you have to move around the board because when you move the enemies move and they charge up and everything and you have like the set number of like hero gauge or I can't remember where you can have your character run across the fields like the other side like most of the
DarkSakura.com
I missed this one.
It's a 360 game?
Yes, it is.
I've been looking for a new RPG to play on 360.
Yeah, and there's probably several things you'd like about it.
Huh.
Because the characters are interesting.
They run into a lot of oddball kind of characters that basically are going on different fetch quests and do this for me, go to this area and fetch me something.
And some are a bit crazy.
Yeah.
but basically it's like basically a series of vignettes and kind of that kind of thing for at least for now because the overarching overarching story you don't you don't really get to that until later and I haven't gone that far yet but let me see what because actually the system map is a little bit interesting because it's actually a hex map where you have to lay down these like you get like a like little things of hexes that you have to put down and and to get through the other areas and there's colors and everything like that
It's actually a fairly interesting game.
Also, you can also play dress-up with the characters because you can actually buy all these different sort of clothes.
It's just not a JRPG if there's not dress-up at some point.
I love the box for the new Xbox 360 controller.
Um...
Also, a question about Game Room.
Ranma says, didn't Sunset Riders drop too?
No, that's rumored that that is in the game pack.
I'll tell you what came out.
I pulled up the list while Arcadian was talking there.
Daytona Twinbee, Puyen, Thwocker, Amidar, Off the Wall, Twinbee, Blades of Steel, Pitfall 2, Trick Trap, and Vectron have all come out in the past three weeks.
Mainly I hadn't checked them out because they stopped updating their Facebook thing because of all the...
All the closures and stuff, so it kind of makes you forget to look.
There's one thing about the new controller that I didn't mention.
The analog sticks have this little lip in them, so it might kind of hurt your finger a little bit more than the old one.
Especially with Super Meatball, where you're jamming the controller left and right and up and down all the time, that can kind of bite into your finger a bit.
Arcadian, you're kind of known as being a quiet guy.
You're playing games, but usually you're quiet and you don't yell.
You're not obnoxious like I am in crowds.
But I have to ask, when you play Super Meat Boy, are you the type that just starts, fuck, I can't fucking believe I lost that level.
God damn.
and you throw the controller against the ground
So, like, every time it was like just getting killed by this guy over and over again.
So, I got really pissed.
That guy was making me swear like fucking crazy.
There you go.
Ah, there you go.
Did you hear that?
Yes.
Just thinking about it makes me fucking crazy.
Yeah, and the same thing with Kyle in the first game.
That guy was an ass.
Fucking annoying as hell.
Always the quiet ones, always is, alright But Super Meat Boy, oh damn, damn, oh well, shit And then go on and just do it again, because it's so fast, you don't really have to think about it, just do it again You have to ask Lasius Pop about when I play Super Meat Boy, it's pretty exciting In fact, he'll even egg me on, he'll be like, don't you want to play Super Meat Boy?
Oh Rob, you're so close to beating that one level, come on, you should play Super Meat Boy Come on, you'll have that level beat in five minutes, come on, it's like entertainment for him
Thanks for watching!
Alrighty.
Let's see.
Going back to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com SolarFlare says, I've been playing Resonance of Fate for PS3.
Makes me feel like I don't know how to play JRPGs anymore.
DungeonBuster says, Fate's battle mechanics take a little getting used to.
I stopped playing it for a week or so and had to hit up easy encounters all over again just to get back into the groove.
You know what other controller I guess had come out recently I really want to get is that Tron controller because the game came out and sadly I have missed the game although I hear it's not so great.
I guess the reviews are mixed at best.
But I'm still curious.
I liked what I played at E3 so reviewers don't always get it right either.
You're reading one man's opinion.
That's all it really is.
It's not a team of people reading it.
What if it's Metacritic where you're reading several people's opinions?
Oh, big deal.
It's a few people.
I mean, they're all over the board with stuff.
There were some people that thought Gran Turismo 5 was awesome.
Some that hated it.
There was... I'm trying to think of one that had really weird reviews on it.
Um...
What was it?
Might have been Epic Mickey, because there were some people that really loved Epic Mickey and people that hated it.
It's going to be like that for everything.
Now, see, this is the weird thing, is that Tron Evolution supposedly has a 58 on Metacritic right now.
This is based on six critics, but then I don't see critic reviews.
So that makes me think, okay, they haven't really...
Had that, so I don't know, whatever I guess the movie only has like a 50-something too, so But people are dumb I mean, they're like Movie critics you have to take with a grain of salt My expectations for the Tron movie are very low As long as it's pretty and at some point I hear end of line I'm gonna be fine, you know what I mean?
My expectations are set really low I can't fucking wait Six days, six more days I heard a Tron rumor
Something to do with... Is this OMG Spoilers?
No.
Something to do... I think this is how the story was read, but Disney is pulling the original Tron DVD from retailers because... It's already done.
It's been in the vault forever.
They're not going to release it until later.
Because I thought that the way that it looks on the box art where it says Tron, they don't want people to go, oh, this is that movie that's in theaters right now, so I'll just buy this when it's a completely different movie, I think.
What the big deal is is that there is a remastered one waiting to be released, and they're not going to release it until after the movie comes out.
You know a box set's coming.
You know a box set's going to happen.
because they actually got the original animator back to go in and do all the touch-up work himself.
Yeah, that reminds me.
I need to watch the original Tron this week again because it's been so long.
I barely remember it.
I have it.
And the Laserdiscs.
I was watching.
They had a really... It was on... I think... It might have been Gizmo...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
um you know obviously uh they've redone all the old content and i'm hearing the worgen and goblin experience is amazing but um you know i talked about on the other show for a little bit my experience just going back and leveling a gnome priest which is one of the new race class combos that you don't need cataclysm for and it was neat a neat upgrade a lot of the mechanics from wrath of the lich king you now find in the classic wow and i think that's what's pretty cool because it
Allows it to have more vehicle type quests and kind of zany things Like today I was in Oldham and I got a daily quest to do a whack-a-mole type of quest It's just kind of weird stuff and a lot of very meta things Like the whole plants versus zombies quest that they have now Or peace balloon versus ghouls, whatever There's a lot of silly things in it But the core game is still great And the end game, I haven't seen a lot of the 85 end game yet Because I'm only about 83 and a third now
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Pretty much roll your way through any dungeon.
You really have to take a step back and go, oh, crap, this is all new content.
I'm not overgeared.
I have to think about this.
And, you know, as a healer, which I play in the game, they made heals very expensive.
So now you really have to think about, do I really need to top this person off or should I go back to focusing on the tank?
So lots of interesting little game mechanics like that.
But if you want to know more about that, I got the other show, so we'll talk more about that.
As far as other games that I played, there were some free games that came out on Xbox this week.
And one of them, I don't even remember the name of it.
Somebody in chat will jump in.
It was one person plays a driver.
You drive around the course and the other person can shoot the driver.
Doritos games?
Yeah, it's one of those Doritos games.
That sounds like an old arcade game.
Was it not the shoot?
It was like one person was the driver and the other person had the gun and it was a two person arcade game.
You are thinking about, like, I know what you're talking about.
Tango and Cash.
Tango and Cash, yeah.
Press HQ?
Or no, Lucky and Wild.
Lucky and Wild, that was it.
My mistake.
That's it.
No, I know what you're talking about, though.
That was neat looking.
It's stupid.
It's free.
Yeah, it's free, exactly.
It was better than Yaris.
It was better than Totem Ball.
Did you download the other one?
Avatar Crash Course?
I downloaded it, but I haven't played it yet.
I know, I know
I hope maybe for the next year's Dorito competition we will have the Golden Girls with Guns game.
That's just Grand Theft Auto with the Golden Girls.
That's all I really want to say.
And I'll have you know, Doritos are kind of orangish.
It works.
And the Golden Girls lived in Miami, so they were kind of orangish.
You know what?
What?
It just occurred to me.
Okay, imagine like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game or the X-Men game or the Simpsons, only with the Golden Girls.
I know, right?
Yeah.
Like, Sophia hits him with that giant purse.
Uh-huh.
And, like, Blanche has the slut attack.
Uh-huh.
And who is the Arthur?
Dorothy, which is sassy.
She has the bitch attack.
Mm-hmm.
And basically, I guess, Rose would just walk through the game clueless.
No, she has stories about St.
Olaf.
She has the St.
Olaf special.
She'd have a goat that would come out.
Yes.
I don't even think that's it either.
It's like...
Thank you, Doritos!
You know what I'm doing right now?
I'm actually clicking to my profile.
Harm's Way.
That was the name of the game.
Thank God.
Thank God for the Xbox.com tracking everything that you play.
Harm's Way was the name of the game.
Phew.
That's weird.
The chat didn't beat me to that.
Usually having the live chat room, some people jump in with a game.
Nobody knew that game.
I guess that should tell me right there.
That's because the chat room didn't care.
Clearly.
All right, let's housekeeping real quick.
If you want to follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
We can always use some more fans there.
And of course, Twitter.
Ask us some questions on Twitter.
We'll get to those in the second half of our show tonight.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
Meanwhile, let's get into the news tonight.
Yes, of course, the ever-denied but absolutely coming PSP2.
More rumors about the capabilities of it, since we don't know too much about it yet.
There are people that are working with it.
They're saying that the graphics are comparable to early PlayStation 3 titles.
It says that the lower resolution screen will surely help minimize the quality gap between PlayStation 3 games and PSP 2 games, but they're saying that it should be rather easy to port PS3 games over to the PSP 2, which sounds pretty impressive, actually.
That sounds dang impressive, but there's got to be a difference in quality.
I don't think that thing's going to be Sport and Blu-ray or whatever.
Well, here's the thing, though.
The textures don't have to be as big.
They can save a lot because it's a smaller screen.
The resolution isn't going to be as big as the PlayStation 3.
and because of that they can do a lot of tricks kind of like for example how they can do a lot of tricks with like you know Infinity Blade to make it look nice on an iPad or an iPod because you know they do a bunch of texture tricks and stuff to make it look like it's actually a higher resolution than it is and actually kind of the same goes with even just the PSP now they have a lot of tricks to make things look better
So, I'm not too concerned about that.
I think it's going to be awesome.
And as long as they have two dual analog sticks, which is great.
Are we talking about having more synergy between the PSP and the PlayStation 3 with this?
Because when...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Not only would you be able to do that with... I'm assuming that this will also be able to emulate PlayStation 1 games as well and possibly PlayStation 2 games later on down the line have downloadable for it.
I mean, that would be really cool.
And then with the remote play, yeah, you would be able to probably play these games to their full extent because you'll have the controls that are going to be mimicking the same thing.
whatever happened to I remember at E3 when this thing was first announced remember Ridge Racer and remember when they were using the PSP as like a rear view mirror did that functionality ever happen in a game like where the PSP was kind of your controller or your spin off device or whatever from the Playstation 3 like I don't remember that ever actually happening did that technology just not play out um maybe somebody in chat knows of the game I think they have had things for that but
Not necessarily Ruby Mirror Are we talking anything like actually really cool?
Are we talking like Buzz will allow you to use the PSP to buzz in?
You know what I mean?
I'm talking about something actually kind of different I don't remember Nothing really stands out How you could visit the Animal Crossing village on your Game Boy Advance When you played GameCube Animal Crossing Remember that?
Now that...
I remember that.
That was awesome.
I used to cheat.
Alright.
So, a comment from our chatroom at chat.orangeonstranger.com GameGuru in our chat says, I'd rather hear about the price points of the 3DS than the PSP2.
Any crazy idea what this might cost?
The PSP2 I'd be willing to bet $300.
Or $250.
I think $250 sounds... I don't know, it's hard to say.
Depends what they're trying to push on it.
I mean, I could see it maybe as high as $300.
Because if they're going to try to compare this, say, with an iPod or something of that nature...
Thanks for watching!
I would hope it'd be around like $200 at the very most, but I don't know, it's hard to say.
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, nothing like Pac-Man vs. on the GameCube.
No.
Yeah, because there was that whole Pac-Man game on the GameCube where you could use, what, the advances, I think, as the controllers for the ghosts or something?
No.
No, Pac-Man would use that because he could see the whole screen.
I don't remember, but it was something like that.
No, the ghosts would be on the TV because they would be split screen on the TV, I think.
And then Pac-Man would be on the Game Boy Advance because Pac-Man could see the whole screen.
Because the ghosts couldn't see where you were at.
Alright.
Because if it's on the TV, then people would screen hack.
And then BlackWolf continues to say it was just remote play where you could play the same game on your PSP on your PS3.
Sometimes, not every game even does that back and forth either.
It's mostly the PS1 classics.
And here's the funny thing about that too.
Thanks to the hackers and stuff, they found out that a lot of games that don't support remote play actually could support remote play, but they just don't.
They've hacked different games to support remote play.
Well, isn't it usually a button issue or something?
No.
That's kind of sad.
Alright.
Well, also, speaking of sad, let's talk about Final Fantasy XIV.
Because there's... Actually, this is kind of sad, actually.
But I think a lot of us said this needs to happen.
Here's the deal.
Final Fantasy XIV, obviously the PC version came out and it's been getting slammed back and forth.
And we were talking about people selling off their stock and all this other stuff.
Here's the thing.
The PlayStation 3 version of Final Fantasy XIV, it was announced this week that it is not coming out in March.
It will be coming out indefinitely.
Like, they don't know when.
They have now said this game has been delayed indefinitely.
And that is like one step short of saying just the whole damn thing is cancelled.
Which is very, very strange.
But here's...
Here's what they're saying about.
The CEO of Squeenix, Yoichi Wada, basically apologized for Final Fantasy XIV and said that the Final Fantasy XIV team is restructuring.
There will be new leadership.
Hiromichi Tanaka, the producer, out.
Naoki Yoshida in the new producer-director.
And a lot of the other positions are being restaffed.
They are, quote, working on a concrete plan outlining Final Fantasy XIV's new direction.
It almost sounds like they are just starting the damn thing over, which is crazy.
Like, have we ever had a game...
and DarkSakura.
here's the great thing you guys after Christmas or even maybe before those copies of Final Fantasy XIV are going to plummet in price and pretty soon for about $20 you'll be able to pick up the game and play for free online indefinitely granted you won't be playing a great game but it'll be cheap
so there you go so that's really interesting to me I think I had said on the show before that I think I even used the phrase heads will roll at Squeenix and this was around the time it was the episode wherever the news came up about the stock getting sold I said that this was an inevitable conclusion that this is really an embarrassment but I don't know if I necessarily blame the producer
who got canned over this as much as I blame whoever made them put this out at Christmas.
This game was a year away from release.
And all of that year, the engine is pretty much done that the game runs in.
The graphics look great.
The sound's fine.
The problem was all the game mechanics weren't implemented.
There's no fucking auction house in the game right now.
Hello?
that's the problem whatever executive or whatever decision made them put this game out this year that's who needs to be canned in my opinion because this game was a year away from being released in reality and so now it's back to the drawing board
Yeah, and it just seemed like with them releasing it in September, October of this year, a lot of people were saying, well, it's kind of a shit circus on PC, but they'll work out the bugs, and maybe it'll play a lot better with a controller in your hand, and it'll be decent on the PS3.
There'll be some bug fixes, maybe a little major patch that comes out, and now it just sounds like, okay, this game is so bad,
I bet that's exactly what happened and I think that it was this whole oh no we stand by our product we stand by our product thing and keep hoping and hoping until it said look this is your reality check bang bang
DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says Rob, and don't forget the anti-addiction timer where they cut off your XP after so long I actually think a lot of that shit's been overblown because guess what?
Warcraft has something similar, but no one's talking about it.
World of Warcraft has something very similar.
The WoW forums are filled of bitter, sour tears of the crying, the anger.
It's the guild experience.
You can only gain a set amount of guild experience in a week.
And I'll tell you what, after this expansion was released, I hit my week cap in a day and a half.
And your guild together can only earn so much experience in a day.
and you get rewarded when you don't play for a while you get double experience so I think a lot of this stuff in 11 or I mean 14 excuse me was kind of overblown because it was what you could play like your character for like 20 hours in a week before you started hitting penalties
My understanding with XIV is that it was the job system.
I don't know exactly what the names of the jobs were, but you couldn't min-max, I don't know, like leatherworking or whatever.
You had to trade your job out for something else and then level that up.
So they just wanted, it wasn't necessarily a OCD, please take a shower and go to bed type thing, but just, you know, it wasn't one of those.
It was just more, you know, we don't want you to min-max one thing.
We want your character to be diverse.
diversify, diversify Ziba in our chatroom I think sums it up very bluntly with this one comment no chocobos either no mounts, gotta walk everywhere it's not so much that but it's a Final Fantasy game with no chocobos that's like that's like a Michael Bay movie with no explosion that's an Anne Hathaway movie with no nude scene what is this?
I don't understand.
TigerClaw on our chatroom says, so Square Enix just pulled an NBA Elite and starting over.
Kinda, except they did it about three months too late did they pull the game off shelves.
Although they haven't really pulled the game off shelves either.
It's just the copies on shelves currently are gathering a lot of dust.
We'll see what happens.
Also, kind of along the same lines, not only is there news about Final Fantasy XIV, but if you're kind of fed up with the current state of XIV, maybe you should go back to Final Fantasy XI, because there's a new expansion coming out in December.
I don't think it's actually an official expansion, it's just one of those Uber patches that's going to really change the game.
The level cap will be going up from 85 to 90, and there will be a lot of new spells and abilities, some new powers for blue mages, because they get monster abilities and so forth.
Yeah, and expansions I know are still coming out for this game They're not retail expansions, they're download expansions But this game's still trotting right along And with some of the screenshots you see that they pick You would think that this game is a newer game They really are able to still sell this with some pretty screenshots
And I believe Steam, whenever they have one of their sales, which is all the time, they have a Final Fantasy XI plus the XIII various expansions that have come out for it.
It's dirt cheap.
For like $5, $9.
And I think it has a month that comes with it.
So yeah, if XIV's that bad, check out the hella pack on Steam for XI.
Yeah, XI's still cooking and it's doing pretty well.
You know what XI needs most of all, though?
To lose PS2 support.
So they could, like, update the engine, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
But at the same time, a lot of people with, like, lower-end laptops and things of that sort are able to run Eleven, you know, because it is a PS2 game.
And I'm sure there's PS2 Final Fantasy XI players that are like, shut your mouth, Rob.
And, you know...
To bring up City of Heroes for the umpteenth time, they just had a graphics update for Going Rogue.
It's an MMO that came out in 2004.
There are people that are on computers from 2004 that are still running fine.
You can't update the graphics too much because you're going to lose your subscriber base that's been with you for six years.
Even if it was on a PC platform, you still have that limitation of...
We've released the suck patch!
Yeah.
Okay.
We're going to redo it.
And so now I'm like, okay, now maybe I can get excited about this game because now they're going to put the year of time that it needed the first time into it.
I miss the flawless, godlike square where even their crap games smelled of vanilla and sang hosannas.
And now they've made an actual shitbag of a game.
I know, look at all the people that still love Final Fantasy VIII to this day.
And like, what a shitty game that was.
Yeah, during the PS1 era, everything, and then Saga Frontier.
I'm just ruffling feathers, because I know there's listeners out there that are like, you shut your mouth, Squall and Zell are awesome, and Laguna, oh my god.
Yeah, the PS1 era, you know, Saga Frontier, bad, Einhander, good, and just Square could do no wrong, Final Fantasy VII, and now it's like, this is what you've become.
Look at yourself.
Look at your life, look at your choices.
Yeah.
SolarFlare in our chatroom says, now XIV is so bad they are taking the guys from XI that made XI good and put them on XIV.
Great!
Because some of the changes that XI got five years too late made that game great.
The whole level sinking, that's something that should have been put into the game about a year after its release, not five.
Because you played XI for about three years and it still had a lot of problems, but you stayed with it.
I finally got sick of it.
Honestly, after playing WoW...
I couldn't take 11 anymore.
I played 11.
For like a week.
No, I played longer than that.
You did.
You were like a couple months.
I was the queen of doing all that crap on my controller too.
I had all my macros set up on my trigger buttons and it was just that one experience that finally was the straw and I'm like, all of you people suck!
And I left off in a big stomping diva huff.
So what Solar Flare is saying, to hear that the guys that made 11 good are now going to go make 14 good?
WAKE ME UP WHEN A RELEASE DATE IS OFFICIAL FOR THE PS3 VERSION
DarkSakura
Well, this is one of those warm fuzzies, and I really mean warm and fuzzy.
The charity Child's Play, we know of Child's Play, don't we?
Of course.
They have capped the 11 million mark.
Not 11 million mark.
When I say 1 million mark, it'd be nice if they capped the 11 million mark, wouldn't it?
We just got done talking about Final Fantasy XI, so, you know.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Really is disappointing, but that's what happens when you live 100 miles away from where the fun's at.
I wanted to go, but I had my algebra final.
I hear it went really well, though.
I'm hearing it was better than last year, which last year I had a lot of fun.
So I'm really happy to hear it.
and, of course, hearing about all this money that was made just collectively amongst all the efforts of not just even the big stuff, but the little stuff, too.
That's great.
And, you know, it's unfortunate that CNN won't report this, but they'll talk about the Xbox gamer that beat up a special needs child for his Xbox, which, yes, was a story on this show about six months ago, I think.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think that they're still looking to reach that by the end of the year.
That would be great if they could top what they did last year considering the state of the world and the economy and all that.
That's a very aggressive goal.
But I think just taking all that into consideration, I think it's great that they've made it as far as they have.
I agree.
I definitely agree.
I'm very pleased.
So, there you go.
Alright, moving on.
Loki.
Yeah.
I don't know the thing of this.
It's kind of ridiculous, but
They have added quests now on the PlayStation Network for the rewards program.
And these quests are basically to get you to test out different things.
For example, they have one of the quests that you can do.
Kind of think of it as achievements.
Check your pulse, which requires you to watch an episode of Pulse on the PlayStation Network.
Or to play a PlayStation Move game, and you get the Move It quest.
or the No Place Like Home quest, which involves you visiting the Central Plaza and PlayStation Home.
So will I get, like, if I successfully complete a quest, will my PlayStation 3 go, it's dangerous to go alone.
Here, take this and, like, give me candy or maybe a letter to take to the old woman so that she'll sell me, you know, drinks?
Well, I don't know.
I...
I just had to laugh when I saw this because it's like, you know, I can see one of the quests being, find a purpose, go visit home, because there is no purpose.
Really, you know, it's, what was it, salt, it's really awesome, or sodium one, I'm sorry, yeah.
It just sounds like that Home is so useless that they've added a layer of meta gaming on top of it just so that you logged on, you sat down, just, I don't know.
Don't get dry-hopped by a furry.
You dance with a furry.
Exactly.
Damn.
DarkTetsuya says, So when will OLR start giving out quests?
Okay.
Go leave a five-star review for the show on iTunes and you get a sticker.
Go tell something nice about OLR to a friend of yours and get a high five.
Get Permaban by DarkSakura Feat of Strength.
You can only do it once.
No, no, no.
We don't want them to achieve that.
You don't want somebody to achieve that.
I don't know that anyone's ever pissed me off to get permabanned.
Yes, they have.
I know they have.
One person I permabanned.
I think there might be two.
The other person, I didn't permaband them.
I just kicked them out the chat room.
Well, whatever.
Anyway, our point is...
So what is the reward?
Is the reward just a virtual trophy-style thing, or do I actually get, I don't know, like a discount on a game, or a...
I don't know, a certificate in the mail?
A spot on the cast of Tester 3?
What?
Well, what the PlayStation rewards are is you get free PlayStation Network bonuses.
And apparently they're for fans.
They didn't really say, I don't think, what the bonuses were.
It says...
The reward's free.
It says it'll be open to the PlayStation owners regardless of the plus status.
Think of it like Club Nintendo or Square Enix members.
PlayStation Rewards is tiered, separating its members into three groups, Select, Pro, and Legendary.
Playing games, downloading demos, using PlayStation Home, being active on the PlayStation.com forums.
And then I guess at the end of the year or something they'll say, okay, this tier gets this, this tier gets that, this tier gets this, and be done with it.
Death Wishings wants to know, how do you sign up?
I believe you do with... I want to say they have their own dedicated website to that.
Let's take a look here.
Meanwhile, while you're looking for that, Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, I think you would get a permaban if you left a one-star review, so don't.
No, you wouldn't get a permaban, but I'm going to bring Shermie over to your house and start talking about the tester.
That's what I'll do.
Uh...
Xlink in our chatroom hypothesizes that you get a signed autograph of Kevin Butler.
There you go.
I'm not sure.
It doesn't really say what it is because I don't think it's fully launched yet.
It's still in beta.
So right now you have to, they say you have to be a highly engaged.
Probably a PlayStation Plus member.
Well, I don't know if it's PlayStation Plus.
It says you have to be a highly engaged PlayStation owner.
Meaning you gotta be posting on their forums and playing home.
It says basically they offer similar features as PlayStation Plus.
It says the only difference I guess is reward is free.
I don't know.
It's just a gimmick to get you to try all the stuff that they have out there like renting videos and stuff like that.
They want you to try that.
No thanks.
You know, Steam has something similar-ish going on right now.
It's not quite as, you know, bold as, you know, trying to get you to go into home and all that stuff.
But they have, like, these quest thing going on right now where you play certain games and once you get, like, actual achievements, like, I think one of them was for the game Droplets.
You had to get a certain amount of points and that was, like, one of four options.
But one of the other options was sign up for an official games fan club.
So one of them was something you didn't have to actually own in a game to do and then, like, other ones would be
and I think what they do like they draw a name it's a scavenger hunt yeah that's what it was like a scavenger hunt and then like they draw a name from all the people who have submitted badges and you get like what is it like a hundred free games or something shit crazy that they do on Steam with their sales so it's this sounds similar except for the fact that Steam I know what I'll get like if I do enough of these I get free games yay
There you go.
Other stuff going on on other consoles.
How about the Wii?
We haven't had a lot of Wii news tonight.
And the Udraw game tablet came out not that long ago.
And we were kind of wondering if it was going to be a hit or a miss.
It sounds like it might actually have been a hit.
THQ has said that they are going to continue to support the Udraw Wii through 2012.
The chief financial officer, Paul Pacino, started to kind of give us some specifics as to what that was going to include at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.
He said that four to five titles will arrive from THQ in the next fiscal year, meaning April to April.
So April 11 to March 2012.
However, you don't know exactly what games are coming out, except there will be a SpongeBob SquarePants game.
There you go.
Woo!
so there it is otherwise as far as the other games go we don't know yet stop asking if it's Mario Paint just stop we want to see it happen too but seriously we haven't heard anything like that yet so just let it go let it go oh Mario Paint but it better have the music mode in it that was awesome-tastic well how about something different how about Kinect sound like fun
Sure.
I haven't touched mine in a week.
Well, the tech firm that made the camera sensor actually released open source drivers for the Kinect.
And that way means that basically you can do pretty much whatever you want with it.
It's developed, put out.
I think they said that the Prime Sense, which is the company that did it.
They're Israeli.
That's really cool.
Anyway.
has set up all kinds of stuff out there for it.
So that'd be pretty cool.
It's the OpenNI framework.
It has an API for writing NI apps and offers middleware that allows RGBD sensors like the Kinect and lets you use it.
So these Kinect hack stories are kind of a dime a dozen now.
I mean, you know, everybody's hacked their Kinect 10 ways from Sunday.
I'm kind of curious what this means.
Like, okay, so there's an open source Kinect driver.
That's cool.
So indie game developers could use this sort of thing.
But this doesn't mean anything official can happen, right?
Because an official company would not be able to use an open source Kinect driver and expect to have their game embraced by Microsoft, right?
Microsoft already said they were excited about this.
to see what modders would be able to do as long as they stayed within the law.
Okay, that's interesting.
Then, with that coming to mind, do you think there's the possibility we could see an actual big game publisher try to do something with Kinect on the PC?
Maybe, but I'm more thinking that they're leaving it open for the indie type stuff.
There's other stuff happening on PC.
I'm also kind of surprised though that with Kinect being like that must-have holiday toy, that they're not letting it embrace the PC side a little more.
I mean, I get it.
They're not doing that because they want to sell more Xboxes.
That's what's going on.
But I'm still kind of surprised they're not...
Outside of this one comment, it's not being a little more embraced because imagine if, you know, the people at whatever sales store like GameStop or whatever could more openly advertise, hey, this device, it runs on your 360 and your PC.
You can play Biggest Loser with Jillian Michaels on your PC.
Woo!
Woo!
My thought is that Microsoft is actually going to have some sort of cross-promotion going on between PC side and do something that's already optimized for PC, or at least quote optimized for PC, so that they can get more sales out of it.
But then again, my other thought too is that if they were going to do that, then the holiday season would have been the time.
Maybe next holiday, because I think this holiday they want to sell Xboxes.
Gaming on PC, in their eyes, I don't think is very huge.
People do it, but it's not like, you know... It's not like you have PCs in your living room.
But don't they keep trying with the games for Windows relaunches?
Yeah, but that's different, though.
People have laptops, and people game on laptops...
DarkSakura.com
I don't think that they're really going to have this.
They may have similar technology down the line or something that may be built into something like an all-in-one PC or like a laptop or something where you can do different gestures to navigate around crap.
Maybe like a new Windows Media Center or something like that.
But I don't think they're going to actually try to push the Kinect for a PC market.
Unless they did have something sort of like you were saying for one of those, because you know Vista has all this ease of access stuff built in.
I mean, they could technically have, well, they'd already created, I'm not saying that Microsoft did this, but there was already a device that technically read brain patterns so that someone could think type.
You know what I mean?
And yeah, it took them two minutes to write an entire sentence.
But if they had the Kinect technology set up, for say that you've got a quadriplegic, they can maybe move their head.
That would be the perfect type of accessibility.
It'd open up a universe to people who didn't have that opportunity before.
And that's another reason why I'm actually glad to see I like to see those types of things come out And not just, you know, ghetto little hacks
Um, let's see, I'm going to the, uh, uh, chat room at chat.orange.com.
Game Guru says, I'm still trying to find an Xbox 360 controller for the PC and not resort to a cord.
Um, it's difficult to do, but you can do it.
It's called an Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver.
Uh, you can buy these.
It's a little dongle for your PC.
And it doesn't just work with the, um, uh...
Thanks for watching!
Is there like a little barcode on the back of this or anything?
No, it's called the Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows.
Would you take a picture of that and put it on our lovely OrangeLaunchRadio.com blog?
They work good for wireless controllers, which I use in my laptop.
Yep, so that's what you need.
I'm looking at Frugal right now.
They're about $20 on various websites, so take a peek.
DarkSakura.com
Wow, that's it?
That is it.
DECA Sports Freedom Call of Duty Black Ops Dubbed Edition
All of those guys.
This is actually a pretty big week in Japan.
On the PlayStation 3, many of those same games.
Call of Duty Dubbed, Castlevania Lords of Shadow, Gundam Musou.
There actually is a PlayStation console bundle coming out with Lords of Shadow this week as well because they love bundles over there.
Sports Champions for the Move comes out this week as well.
And one other game, Umeniko no Naku Koro ni Majo 2-3 no Rinbu Kyoku comes out this week.
I have no idea what this is.
Although one of the screenshots, hecka looks like Phoenix Wright.
It says it's like the PC version.
I guess this is an adapter or an adaption of the PC version.
It's an adventure novel adaptation.
But that does not look like Phoenix Wright.
Objection.
Oh, yuck.
There's a girl who got stabbed with something.
This does kind of seem like a crime type game or something.
Maybe it's a different company's answer to Phoenix Wright.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Moving on to other consoles on the Nintendo Wii.
Monopoly Here and Now, the World Edition, because I know you're all looking forward to that, gets a price reduction this week.
Pac-Man Party comes out this week, as well as Shape Boxing 2.
Wii Day.
Enjoy Diet!
That's really the name, you guys.
Really the name.
Going on to the PSP, Shining Hearts this week from Sega is the big release on the PSP.
Otherwise, a variety of games are getting a price reduction, like Suigetsu Portable and so forth.
There it is.
Your Japanese releases.
Well, for our friends in the UK, I've just got three things.
Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves on PS3.
That's on the 15th.
On the 16th, World of Goo for iPad.
And on the 18th, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam, which is a whole whopping three days before the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 release.
That's it.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
Where DarkSakura is going to pull a game from the archives And I will say, she did go way back in the archives this week And it's a game that even I remember And I used to like too I'll tell you this much, it's a Sega game Surprise But it's one that I remember We'll get to that in a minute Loki
well there's still more progress going on in Australia to approve a new rating for video games to allow adult themed video games to be released in Australia I had already passed the federal cabinet and they've approved that
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and basically right now they haven't really come to a conclusion whether they're going to pass it or not but I mean it's the federal cabinet thinks it's okay and gamers think it's okay so we'll just have to see it's a matter of time
I think they should I mean hell if anything you know Australia always seems to have like the cliche you know manly men and you know they're tough and the thunder from down under is that what you're talking about or not like not necessarily that but I don't know it just seems kind of Rob that's a dish it out back Astro Purview which I think is what he was referring to
But isn't Australia also the country that bans a lot of games outright?
Yeah, because they didn't have this.
If this goes into place, they will have a way to classify those games.
SolarFlare in our chatroom says, Oh, I heard about this on Zero Punctuation.
Guy made a big fuss about it.
Doesn't he make a big fuss about everything?
I thought that was kind of a joke.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
All right, moving on to another story.
This has to do with the VGAs, of course, who were last night.
The Video Game Awards on Spike TV.
Eh, you know what?
I'm over it.
Like, I don't really watch it because I know all the news is going to hit the internet five minutes later, which is exactly what happened.
I honestly thought they were today, but whatever.
Whoops.
I want to see it just because Neil Patrick Harris is going to be hosting it, and he's awesome.
How can they make the VGAs more tolerable?
More Neil Patrick Harris?
That's true.
But also, I think they should just stop trying to make it cool.
Because when people who don't... There's so many people, I think, that try to make the VGAs cool.
Like, this is cool, you guys.
We're going to do this really cool segment of a dick and fart joke.
It's going to be really funny.
You don't know anything about video games.
They're just trying to make it like the MTV Movie Awards.
And you know what's sad?
They do a better job than G4 does.
Best Episodes of Cheaters!
Alright, well, there were some pretty big stories that came out of the VGAs, even though, you know, most of it was, like, just little teases.
Just little teases, like, I know something you don't know.
But one of the big trailers, of course, was Elder Scrolls V, Skyrim.
Not a damn piece of gameplay in the trailer, just some dragon waking up and, you know, narration.
But that was enough for me to go, what?
Was the dragon waking up and narration going...
Girl, I'm a dragon.
I'm waking up.
Time for another Elder Scrolls game.
That's right.
Oh, yeah.
That's exactly actually what it sounded like.
No, here, I'll play.
I happen to have a link to the trailer right here.
Let me see if I can play a little bit for you.
I'm a dragon, y'all.
I'm waking up.
How's it going?
Nothing like that.
Stop it.
New Elder Scrolls.
Yeah.
Hold on.
I'm trying to play some of the trailer here and the stupid website's like, what's your date of birth?
Because the content here... No, it's not really the world premiere here, you guys.
Let's see if I can... Can I jump forward and just play... I hate live radio sometimes.
This is stupid.
There you go.
See, look.
Stone stuff.
And a Bethesda logo.
And really passionate narration.
Harry Potter!
Why did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?
Anyhow, there it is.
It's coming out on November 11th, 2011.
That's what they announced as their release date.
Good luck meeting that release date.
That sounds like a very specific release date and not something that they made to plan a gimmick of a year or anything like that.
DarkTetsuya says, Loki should totally be the voice of a gay dragon in a video game.
Yes, he should.
I like this as a grassroots campaign.
No.
Loki, you need to be a gay dragon.
It was just a... Has anyone watched Family Guy?
Do you have something against it?
Do they not know of, like, was it the one guy who talks in there all the time?
Hey, I'm a bee, you know, I might sting you.
Oh, I've stung myself.
That's all I was mocking.
I mean, I am not playing a gay dragon in anything.
That's dumb.
That's just like people trying to get me to be the voice of Tingle.
No, not gonna happen.
Yeah, I enjoy it.
Or dressing up like Tingle, or anything that has to do with Tingle, because that character's retarded.
If they make some sort of Epic Mickey type game with all the Nintendo characters, then yeah, he'll be in there with, what was that, Captain Rainbow.
Yeah, anybody remember Captain Rainbow?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
I enjoyed the Family Guy parody of aliens that had that character in it.
Oh, you're trying to escape with that little girl.
I'm gonna bite you with my second face now.
Oh no!
It's the airlock!
Oh no!
I have to see that now.
Maybe Salacious Pop needs to be the gay dragon.
Would you be a gay dragon, Salacious Pop?
He's nodding.
He'd do the gay dragon.
There you go.
All right.
And Tigerclaw is saying, isn't it 11-1-11, which is a Tuesday?
It's not going to come out then anyway.
It's going to get delayed.
These games always do.
Here's the thing, though.
Despite the fact that the trailer didn't show us really anything new, I'm just happy that it wasn't a trailer for a multiplayer Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
Don't get me wrong, that would have been kind of cool like four years ago.
But now it's time to move on to a new game.
So I'm excited.
Also, some other things that were revealed to the VGAs.
There's going to be a Mortal Kombat game on the PlayStation 3.
Oh wait, we already knew that.
But this trailer had Kratos in it.
That's right, Kratos is going to be a playable character in Mortal Kombat on the PS3.
So now him and Scorpion can just keep driving hooks into each other.
That'll be fun.
All they need is Pinhead from Hellraiser to come out and it'll be hook-tastic.
You know, when I heard the news that Kratos was in it, that was exactly the thought that came to my mind was, get over here!
No, you get over here!
Get over here!
I will take you both to hell.
That's what the trailer was.
Was him and Scorpion fighting.
Oh, and Mass Effect 3.
And there was a trailer for it, and it's coming out holiday 2011.
And I'm sure a lot of fanboy...
Excitement going on over that one because Mass Effect is a very popular series.
There it is.
Anyhow, let's get into the classic game of the week.
It's a segment here on the show.
We can take a look at gaming's past.
You know, screw this Elder Scrolls V jib jab and all this talk of Kratos.
Damn it, kids!
Newfound, fangled game characters.
I remember a time...
When they look pixelated and we liked it, right, DarkSakura?
What's the classic game of the week?
Yes, we did.
The classic game of the week is Wonder Boy in Monsterland.
Ooh.
It was put out by Westone.
It came out on the Master System.
Sorry.
Very loud.
Sorry.
Well, actually, it was in the arcades in 1987, but it came out on the Master System in 1988.
Activision released it for the Amiga in 87.
It came out on the Commodore 64, the Armstrong CPC, ZX Spectrum, and Atari ST in 1989.
It was titled Super Wonder Boy Monster World in Japan, and then Super Wonder Boy Monster Land in Europe.
My cartridge of this says Super Wonder Boy Super Monster Land.
So, inconsistent, I don't know.
It actually was retooled for the Famicom by Jaleco, and it was redone as a version of Journey to the West.
Hudson Soft brought it out for Famicom and PC Engine to be like Bikuriman, I guess.
It came out in Brazil as Monica no Castelo do Dragao, I guess.
I don't speak Portuguese.
But I do know that they speak Portuguese in Brazil.
Okay.
And it was actually based off of the Monica's Gang comics that were in Brazil.
and it came out on mobile phones in 2005 and for the virtual console in 2008 in Japan and 2009 over here and in Europe.
It was a sequel to the 1986 game Wonder Boy and it's 11 years after that game where everything is peaceful and the evil King Tom Tom basically was gone.
And then Wonder Boy, a fire-breathing dragon, showed up
and basically wanted to go in and conquer Wonderland, turning it into Monsterland and crap happened.
So Wonderboy popped up and he's like, okay, I'll kill the Mecha Dragon.
Whatever.
So anyway, a lot of this is like, I never cared about the story when I was playing this.
I was like, yeah, got a sword.
So anyway, it had some slow load times on the computers, had some issues, but it was super fun.
The Master System version is indeed the best home version that there is.
In my opinion, and that of many others.
So, um, the way that it plays is you actually start off in the City of Wonder without anything.
Um, but the city's mayor gives you a sword and a revival potion and off you go!
It has 12 levels.
Each of them have its own neat features and monsters and crap.
You use a D-pad to move around and you've got magic weapons that you can select and all kinds of skipping and jumping and smiting things.
You have a life meter that is red hearts, the more you can build them up as you go.
You start off with five, and when you hit damage they turn black, kind of like Zelda.
And you can get gold by killing things, because apparently when monsters die they bark gold.
Or you can hit trees and clouds, because gold hangs out in clouds all the time.
You also have an hourglass timer.
And when the hourglass runs out, Wonder Boy starts losing life.
But you can refill it by collecting more hourglasses in hospitals or taverns.
Because that's always where I look for my hourglasses, is with some beer or sick people.
Of course gold hangs out in clouds.
Where do the golden showers come from?
On the ZX Spectrum version, you had a candle for your timer.
For the Master System version, you had a status screen, so it's just to show you what you got, how much gold you have, what your armor, your equipment, because I carry a status screen around with me all the time, too.
I just usually, whenever you see me drowning out, it's usually, I'm looking at my status screen going, damn, I need more stuff.
You also have the magic weapons, like I said before, you have bombs that roll on the ground, and fireballs, and tornadoes, because I also carry tornadoes in my pocket.
And a thunder flash that damages everything on the screen.
So basically, there's lots of little secret stuff in there.
It looks like the character also, in his weakest form, is wandering around in a diaper.
All this talk of golden showers and diapers is making me very sick, just so you know.
But it is one of the earlier roleplay games, action-adventure roleplay.
It was pretty fun, came out on a bunch of stuff like I said before, and Wonder Boy in Monsterland is one of the, I'd say, one of the top Master System games.
And I'm really not surprised, you know, that it got its own special release in Brazil because they love the Master System in Brazil.
Oh my gosh.
Seriously?
There's like so many Sega games were retooled, like Genesis games even, were retooled to come out on the Master System because they love the Master System in Brazil.
Mm-hmm.
Um...
It did really well.
Got some pretty high ratings.
The lowest of its ratings were the Amiga, followed by the Commodore 64.
Master System, though, really, really hit the top of the chart.
And there were other games that came out along the same lines.
Monster Boy, Wonder Boy Monster Land, though.
I'd have to put that up at Pinnacle.
Alright.
And you know what?
I'm going to check my status screen now.
There it is, your classic game of the week, Wonder Boy in Monster Land.
Arcadian, I know you like the Sega games.
Do you have any fond memories of this one?
I've only played this one a little bit.
The thing is, before I played this one, I played the third one.
It's like the Monster Boy... Wonder Boy 3, The Dragon's Trap, which is actually one of my favorite games.
You get turned into a dragon?
I was like, he looks like Boba Boba.
I only got to play this one a little bit, and it's kind of hard at the beginning.
I'm going to grab the cartridge, by the way, and take a picture of it.
This is one of the few Master System games that I remember playing.
That's why I was kind of excited to see this as the pick.
Now, some of the chatters were thinking, hasn't this game been done before?
Nope.
You got to check our wiki.
It has been done before.
Yeah, and DarkSakura's yelling from the other room, it was Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
And Alex Kidd and the series have some similarities, but no, they're very different games.
So you can always check our wiki, because I know DarkSakura does.
I think she's at the point where she checks our wiki every... And tonight's game is already on there.
That's how awesome our wiki updating community is.
Yes, I do check the wiki, which is, I was gonna do Alex Kidd and Shinobi World, and I was like, you know, I had to have done Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
So I will take a picture of Super Wonder Boy Super Monster Land.
OrangeLoungeRadio.wikia.com is where that is all at, if you're curious.
Meanwhile, we're going to take a break.
It's break time here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back with plenty more.
We have more news coming up.
Twitter topics.
Here's your chance to get your tweets in at Twitter.com slash OLR.
And of course, your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR in the second half of the show.
Emails and so much more.
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are taping live on this December the 12th of 2010.

We'll be taking phone calls later on at 1-877-GAME-OLR and of course the Twitter topics are coming right up.
Orange Launch Radio isn't the only show some of us here in the studio produce.
We've been trying to really sell our spinoff shows lately.
The one I do is called Horde House, and it was a huge week this week with the release of World of Warcraft Cataclysm.
If you have some interest in World of Warcraft, don't worry, we won't tell that you're downloading the show and listening to it.
It's okay.
It can be our little secret.
Just search for Horde House on iTunes or whatever favorite podcast program you like.
We don't really have an official website yet, but you can get all the podcasts at
HordeHousePodcast.blogspot.com I think is where you can get all the mp3s directly if you're like ew I hate iTunes so that'll work DarkSakura has a show too yes it's called Comic Insanity as in the letter N with no I before it and we are on excuse me not on cough we're on infamous.net that's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net
and it's me and Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow and we talk about comics usually we'll discuss the stuff coming out and what we've read all this month we are doing a best of like what was our favorite what was the worst you know how much Tiara is pissed off at Matt Fraction for how he's writing Iron Man he who shall not be named which I can say on this show Jeff Loeb
Sorry.
Thank you for ruining everything, Jeff Loeb.
And, you know, talk about how much Rob Liefeld can't draw and all that.
There might be some crossover.
It's like your favorite fanfic come to life this week because one of the hosts over on Comic Insanity who's not Jamie wants to come be on Horde House and we're going to try to make that happen in the next couple weeks.
That is so completely not a surprise.
We're all a bunch of addicts, and you're trying to get me addicted.
Just pass the needle over, Rob.
Puff, puff, pass.
I'll wear the track marks for you, Rob.
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, some rapid-fire news.
Loki.
Yes.
So this is more stuff kind of coming... Well, at least this one is coming out of the Spike Video Game Awards.
Actually, earlier this week they announced that Uncharted 3 Drake's Deception is coming out.
Now we know that it's coming out sometime in 2011.
My guess would be the fall.
And apparently the game will feature Drake and partner Sully on a hunt for a lost city and a journey that leads them to the Arabian Peninsula and Rubal Kali Desert.
And they said that the story not only lifts from the life of Sir Francis Drake, but also the British Army officer and archaeologist T.E.
Lawrence, as in Arabia.
and this was kind of shown off a little bit during the VGAs and also they had a preview in Entertainment Weekly.
That's crossing over for you now, isn't it?
And of course, you know, the movie that's going to suck.
Fortunately, Mark Wahlberg
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
There was a movie where he was with Leonardo DiCaprio or something like that.
It was like some mobster movie.
I'll take your word for it.
But he was good in that.
But yeah, happening.
Kind of wish it didn't happen.
But the riff track is awesome.
Seriously, if you got to watch that movie once in your life, watch it with the riff tracks.
Other fun stuff, and this is kind of cool because it's been out on the PC and the Wii, but now PlayStation 3 owners will get the chance to play Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people.
It'll be coming out on December 21st, and it's also coming to Mac as well.
um doesn't really say what the pricing is going to be yet but apparently um you know they're saying in comparison the PC right now all five episodes are um on sale for $29.95 so something maybe around that price um that's kind of cool and then finally Jacino Rama is screaming in the chat that The Departed was a good movie that was The Departed yes that's the one that he was in so um
And finally, if you're a fan of Quake, Quake Arena Arcade is finally coming to Xbox Live Arcade on December 15th.
So you can check that out.
It's very similar.
I think it's based off Quake 3 Arena.
This is the first first-person shooter on Xbox in a very long time I'm really excited about and I hope other OLR people are going to play because I actually really like Quake.
Good times.
So if you want to get fragged, you have to let me know.
Any other special features coming with that, or is it just like a straight-up PortaQuake 3, or what?
It looks a little different.
It's kind of... It doesn't really say if it's going to be a little different.
I thought it was going to be kind of similar to the one that they have right now, like the browser game, but maybe not.
I don't know.
What were you saying over there, DarkSakura?
I said, what if we want to be fraggled?
Well, maybe I'll have to get SSJ100Matt to get that little thing on his controller that plays the songs, and every time I frag somebody, I can do the theme song.
We both clapped.
That's enough.
All right.
Some other quick news.
Loki's just sitting there going, I'm just going to play poker on my little iPod.
It's swords and poker.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Swords and poker.
My bad.
Y'all, my bad.
It's swords and poker because that's so different.
There's a new DDR game coming out on the Xbox 360.
It will actually support the Xbox Live Vision Camera.
Ooh, come on!
No one has... Oh, no one should have that.
Here's the deal, guys.
It's pretty much a port of the PlayStation 3 version, just without the move stuff.
That's pretty much what this is.
It's not even Kinect.
It's just DDR, like you've known it, but not quite... It's not a universe.
I guess this is what that whole... Remember when they were going to reboot DDR...
It's new!
Yeah, this is it.
But now it's just kind of landing like a poop in the toilet.
By the way, that didn't already come out on PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And no one cared.
This is just Konami dropping the kids off at the pool.
That's really what they're doing at this point.
But hey, DDR fans, hope you enjoy it.
Coming to the PSN, Neo Geo Games.
See, I kind of thought this was a dub because I seem to remember in the Japanese releases I was talking about a Neo Geo controller that was coming out for the PlayStation.
But whatever, some news is hitting out this week that starting December 22nd, the Neo Geo Station is coming out on the PlayStation Network and it will sell games for 900 yen for the PlayStation 3 versions of the game and PSP versions of games for 700 yen.
So it's games like Baseball Stars Professional, Magician Road, Metal Slug, League Bowling, Super Sidekicks Magician Road?
No, yeah, it's Magician's Lord Magician Lord Somebody made a typo typo in that one Unless that's what it was called in Japan That could be what it was And Art of Fighting, we're all coming out Oh yay, Art of Fighting You know what's funny?
I think I have all those games
It's basically Game Room on your PlayStation 3 with Neo Geo stuff.
And yes, it'll be coming to the U.S.
PlayStation Network as well.
December 21st.
$8.99 for a PS3 game and $7 for a PSP game.
All in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Neo Geo.
Can you believe that, DarkSakura?
20 years old.
We're old.
I have one.
Also, don't you have like several games?
of Neo Geo?
Yeah.
No, I have a Neo Geo, a Neo Geo CD, and one Neo Geo pocket, and two Neo Geo pocket callers.
So several.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Duodesim.
That's the new Dissida, the sequel that's coming out on the PSP.
It was announced in Shonen Jump, a weekly magazine in Japan, that Laguna is going to be one of the new characters.
That's kind of rad, actually.
Laguna was a really good character.
And yeah, I'm sure the Final Fantasy VIII fans will be pleased.
DarkSakura.
Well, how about something that isn't Laguna, Mr. FanboyWank?
I'm sorry, I did not like Laguna.
Just saying.
It was all about Irvine and his gun.
But how about some Billy Joel?
Kids like Billy Joel.
And apparently kids are going to like Billy Joel enough to have a Billy Joel pack for Rock Band.
Yay.
Will it have We Didn't Start the Fire in it?
and there are, I think, which one has the expansion?
Pressure has the pro bass expansion available.
So, you know what?
There's a song that I should send you.
It's the best recording of it I have.
Weird Al, one of his live songs.
Is it still Billy Joel to me?
Thanks for watching!
This is really dumb, but a lot of work went into this really dumb project that they pulled off pretty well.
I don't know.
Salacious Pop was over when I was playing it, and you could hear the song playing, and he was like, ah, are you watching that video?
Sorry, DarkSakura.
I just was mesmerized by the next story.
You're going to share with our listeners or are you just going to sit there and watch it?
The next two characters that are going to be out for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is Crimson Viper and Storm.
And I don't give a shit about Crimson Viper because Crimson Viper stands for cheap bitch.
But Storm, cool.
And it's even her more current comic book outfit too.
So this is pretty awesome even though right now Magneto's kicking her in the face.
Also, Storm has a very impressive rack in this game.
That's important.
Yes, yes it is.
Very important.
But it looks like her attacks might be actually taken from her old X-Men vs. Street Fighter.
Just completely done up and made incredible.
It's really pretty.
Her Ice Storm attack is really, really nice.
And Crimson Viper is a cheap bitch.
What's Her Face With The Glowing Feng Shui Eye
There's going to be like 11 billion characters in this game anyway.
Hey, Capcom, put in Strider, hear you.
The end.
Oh, look, there's Morgan's boots.
Or give us just a new Strider game, The End.
Or bring Strider from the NES to the Virtual Console.
No.
I like that one, I'm sorry.
Yeah, but it was based off the comics in...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm, wow, and dude, Black Spider-Man, that's awesome.
Okay, so how about some other, other, other, other news?
And this is having to do with Fallout New Vegas.
This is, well, a bunch of, a bunch of fixings of stuff.
The game is great.
I've seen it in action.
It's got stuff wrong with it.
What the fixes will now have is companions now show up as waypoints on the map.
Companions will always fast travel with you unless told to wait or sent away.
Download content error slash save corruption is fixed.
Entering the strip after debt collector causes game to crash and auto save corruption.
That's been fixed.
Another fix is using the Mojave Express Dropbox can cause DLC warnings.
That's fixed.
Crafting menu now filters valid bright recipes to the top of the list.
Weathered Pistol no longer glitches when applying mods.
And also quite a number of other things were fixed.
And lots of fixes for pretty much a ton of the quests.
So, go update Fallout New Vegas.
All right.
Let's get to the Twitter topics.
Let's go check the tweeter and see what folks are tweeting to us this week.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
If you want to interact with the show, you want to say, hey, the Twitter's a good way to do that.
Let's start with a tweet from Blue Swim tonight.
You remember Blue Swim was the Techno Kitten Adventure tweet that started that whole stuff.
Alright, this tweet probably won't inspire an interview, but it's interesting nonetheless.
It has to do with a Kinect flying machine.
That's right.
Apparently it's this whole thing where you have this mini-copter and it sees itself in the Kinect and it avoids obstacles by detecting them on the Kinect and it knows its own altitude.
It's crazy.
I guess there's a backup motion capture device involved in everything.
But there's a YouTube.
I have to mute Santa there for a minute so we can look at the YouTube here in studio of this thing in motion.
And I guess you can kind of actually see how the Kinect senses things around.
And now there goes the copter.
It's flying.
I'll buy it's lonesome and I guess this guy's gonna take a cardboard tube and like try to whack it out of the air but it's gonna know that it's there and it'll say like oh I better fly away from that.
He's not trying hard enough.
Yeah.
He needs to be faster.
You could do like real baseball with this.
Have a baseball just floating in midair and then just flack right through the TV.
That'd be more like T-ball.
Maybe in this case K-ball.
T-ball, I like that.
Alright, anyhow.
Back to Santa.
Let's see, other tweets.
Blue Swim wants to know if any of us are going to pick up the Super Mario All-Stars Wii port.
No.
Anybody?
Anybody?
If someone gives it to me.
I can't wait to buy the Mario game.
What, you mean the new one?
No, all of them, again and again.
Forever.
Forever.
some stuff from Spazinator is tweeting us to know number one two quick notes for us number one I'd recommend that everyone catch the last episode of FNG live next Friday it's a good show I am a show actually I don't want to sound like Debbie Downer I thought it was already over but if it's not then yes you should go support our buddy Bobby because I know he's worked very hard on that project and
It's a bummer, but you know what they say, all good things, dot dot dot, was the last episode of Star Trek.
Spazinator also says, as self-serving as it sounds, and seeing that there's no official blog posting for it, follow me on Twitter for news on PSN video freebies.
you know you should instead of doing it through your Twitter dude get like a blog spot or a tumblr or something and any idiot can have a blog look at us we have a podcast just go on iTunes iTunes is living proof that any idiot can podcast you can do better than Twitter Spazinator I know you can I believe in you do you believe in Spazinator
Huh?
Yeah.
Alright.
Yes, whatever you just said, Rob.
No, that was perfect.
That was fine.
Funny T-Man wants to link us to, look, I found a Technokitten ripoff.
Oh my god, the clone games, I guess, are starting now.
There's a game on Xbox Live, any marketplace that he links us to.
Again, this is Funny T-Man on Twitter called Asteroids Do Concern Me.
What?
What?
That's actually, that was one of the indie games that they had.
Oh, I see.
Some of the levels are serious, but there's like this third level here that's unicorns and pooping rainbows.
That's one of the ones that they showed, you know, as part of the indie games push that they're doing.
Remember right now?
Yeah.
It looked interesting.
Is there like a Raver Puppy Odyssey game coming out or something?
Yeah.
No, but it can.
It should.
That would be awesome.
Let's see.
I'm looking at the official trailer for Asteroids Do Concern Me.
Let's see here.
Waiting to see some gameplay.
Here we go.
Oh, this is like the same type of thing where you use the button to float up and down.
It just moves really fast.
And you collect orbs.
I have to admit, this actually looks a little more advanced than Technogit Adventure.
Where's the meowing?
But I guess there's... Oh, there's some cute little modes.
What's this?
Okay.
Double Rainbow mode.
Aha!
Double Rainbow.
Of course.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hey, Rob.
That one's cool.
Doodle mode.
Noah's awesome, though, about that whole game right there as part of that trailer where they're like, yeah, we're sick of the people cloning games out there, and they show off the games that they have and the ones that they're pushing.
A lot of them are clones of other things.
But see, here's the thing.
You know why you can't call Asteroids Do Concern Me a ripoff?
Because it's missing two very, very, very important things.
Yes, the gameplay is the same, but here's the thing.
Techno and kittens?
It's...
That's right!
It's missing kittens, and it's missing happy hardcore.
Everybody rave!
Peace, love, unity, respect.
My name's Starshine.
Such a great rave.
You guys, let's drop some E and make out!
Oh my gosh, you guys!
Yay!
Let's make some candy!
I'll trade you this candy necklace for your candy wristband.
Woo!
And then a big gust of wind gets caught in their JNCO pants wide like jeans and they blow off.
TigerClaw305 sends us some tweets.
Blockbuster laughed at a Netflix partnership proposal in 2000.
Isn't it always funny?
You get these hindsight as 2020 stories and it's kind of like, look who's laughing now.
This is the story I think it is.
It was a part of the deal was that the Netflix brand had to remain.
And Blockbuster was like, no, if we do anything, it's got to have the Blockbuster name on it.
We don't think this is a viable way of delivering rentals.
Yeah.
Fail.
They thought it was a very small niche business.
This is just some flash in the pan that's going to go away.
DVDs over the mail.
Come on.
That's like groceries to your door.
This is some web van shit.
No, no.
That's on the interwebs.
That's just college kids and junkies on the interwebs.
I hate Blockbuster so much, so I get the best schadenfreude from anything.
Blockbuster's CEO for types of cancer.
I'm like, that's because you run Blockbuster.
I gave it to you.
Wow!
That's vicious.
That's really horrible.
No, I'm being hyperbole right now.
You know, not all of them are corporate-run stores, by the way.
Yeah, that's... Can I dig into this a little more?
Hold on.
Why do you have such hatred for Blockbuster?
They used to work for them.
There are certain movies... You have a $60 late fee still, don't you?
There are certain movies that they just wouldn't carry.
Like, if it was a rated R movie, but it was an LGBT-themed movie, like Boys Don't Cry with Hilary Swank, they wouldn't carry it.
They just had this weird sort of censorship, like family-friendly stuff.
It's bullshit.
Let people rent movies what they want.
Don't... Yeah.
Is that the showgirls with the bras drawn on?
Yeah, that's the copy.
If they had a copy of Showgirls at all, that's the copy they would have.
So Netflix all the way.
I don't care.
$55 if you want it though
That just makes me think that it would get really linty and cruddy because even if you use a mouse a lot, they get kind of gross.
So I don't know why you'd want buttons on there.
Not my mouse.
My mouse smells like kittens and rainbows.
It's perfect.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And lastly, a tweet from Gamer Girl who wants us to know, La Mulana rocks, just saying.
Go ahead, girl.
Go ahead, gamer girl.
With your La Mulana.
There it is, our tweets.
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
Actdeft wants us to know that Netflix isn't in Mexico.
He says, since Netflix doesn't exist here, I'm still stuck with Blockbuster and it ain't bad.
It ain't bad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, are Mexican blockbusters the same as the ones here?
Pretty much.
Do they still sell the candy up front as much as you pay for at the movie theater?
Wouldn't there be a 7-Eleven next door to get the same thing for a sixth this much money?
Just curious.
Thanks for watching!
Anyways, so, of course, one of the highlights is how well did the Kinect do?
And it did pretty well.
It actually outsold the PlayStation Move 5-1 in November, which is pretty impressive, I'd say.
And...
Also, of course, Microsoft didn't do too bad with Xbox 360 systems.
They sold 1.37 million units in November.
And they said that it puts the Kinect bundle figure range around 685,000 units.
And the Move console bundles around...
1,337,000 units and it says right now global sales have topped 2.5 million units and Sony has reported 4.1 million Playstation Move units have been shipped to retailers though the company hasn't disclosed actual sales numbers and
Let me be honest here.
4.1 million and 2.5 million.
I don't want to sound biased or anything, but you're comparing move units versus the Kinect.
The Kinect, you need one.
The move, you may need up to four.
That's a little... Are they counting the nav controller on top of that?
It's a little wonky, those numbers, but...
Fuzzy Math
Some of the top games, of course, for November.
It's not a big surprise.
Call of Duty Black Ops being number one.
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, number two.
Although number three is kind of surprising.
Just Dance 2 is the top title for November.
Followed by Madden 11, Fable 3, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, Gran Turismo 5.
NBA 2K11, and Wii Fit Plus.
Because people still buy Wii Fit Plus.
And of course, with the Kinect titles coming out, it's no wonder.
I mean, you're going to guess the best-selling title for the Kinect, other than obviously Kinect Adventures, because that comes with the actual units, Dan Central.
It was the number 11 title overall in sales for the month, and the top-selling Kinect title as a standalone SKU.
Awesome.
And who says music games are dead?
I don't know who.
People.
If Harmonix is up for sale, though, that's not necessarily a good sign, but maybe this will help.
I'll buy it for $2.
Stop.
All right.
Nobody in the debt, though.
They can keep the debt.
Apparently, yeah, there's some... I've got a story, and believe it or not, guys, pay attention, because it involves video games and it involves pornography.
You ready?
It has to do with Nintendo porn.
Apparently, there's a website.
I've never heard of this.
VideoGamePorn.com
It received a notice from SciValence, which is a company I guess it was hired by Nintendo, saying that the site has been committing trademark violation because they used the name Nintendo to describe an image of a scantily clad woman who holds a Nintendo DS.
So it's like, chick with boobies out plays Nintendo DS, and now Nintendo is like, OBJECTION!
You can't say Nintendo.
VideoGamePorn.net Oh, are you looking this up?
Yeah.
We are an internet monitoring agency representing Nintendo of America, Inc.,
We are writing to ask you to stop using the Nintendo properties in the hidden text, visible text, meta tags, and or title, and or other links of the above-referenced sexually explicit website.
You know what?
Me reading this just by itself isn't working for me.
This needs something.
What could this use?
You know what?
I know.
I know.
Play something sexy for me.
Nintendo's customers include many children and their parents.
Unauthorized use of Nintendo's trademarks and works is harmful to those customers and will tarnish Nintendo's reputation.
We look forward to your immediate confirmation that you have taken the necessary steps to resolve this matter.
To that end, you may email us at stopinfringementatcivalence.com I probably shouldn't have given that out, huh?
Please note that these are automatic email boxes, so typically no response is sent as long as the problem is corrected.
What?
So, in other words, it's just like this whole automated thing?
Click button, send cease and desist notice?
That's awesome.
That's interesting.
And now everybody in studio is looking at geekgirlsonline.com.
I got bored of it really quick.
That wasn't the site.
That was just a link on the site.
Oh, I see.
It was videogameporn.net.
I want to see the naughty.
Oh, look at, oh, she is definitely using a DSI to cover up her naughty bits.
And like, I like this because in one, in one picture here, she's showing, okay, I'm, I'm using the DSI to take a picture of my panties.
You see that?
That's one picture.
And then in another, she's, she's using the DSI.
She's holding it up to her face and she's like, oh, maybe I'll take an artful picture with my DSI.
And then the last picture, she's just fingering her pussy.
Okay.
and there's no DSI whatsoever.
It's just, hey, I decided to put it away.
Guess where I put it?
I found a new toy.
Yeah, my mind, the jokes right now.
Please, by all means.
You're going to ruin your stylus.
You have to get another one.
That's why she has an XL.
Her belly button has very awkward placement.
Doesn't her belly button kind of look like really left of center?
Like, doesn't that kind of like look like a gunshot wound?
That is where the stylist is right now.
I don't know.
It's perspective, Rob.
Either that or bad photoshopping.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Anyway, it's already been going on here, but now Amazon UK is going to be paying for old games and trade-in.
You can print up a prepaid delivery label for your box.
Sorry, I was thinking of the last story.
And for example, if you send a Medal of Honor, you'll get a 23-pound gift card credited to your account.
That's a heavy gift card.
I see what you... How's British Money Joke?
I like that.
Okay, then I'll change it.
For Just Dance 2, you get 15 quid.
How's that?
For Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, 28 quid.
So now you can't make a joke about that.
Well, we could.
It probably just wouldn't be funny.
But I think it's like up to three.
And if your game's broken, they're going to send it back.
And they'll basically just send you a confirmation to say you can have the money or you can't.
And then they'll send it back in two weeks.
Really faulty stuff may be just thrown away.
So I guess maybe it's a free way of getting rid of shit.
You might get stuff back.
But it's supposed to be, again, three a month.
There's an ad on that page you're reading from that says insert coin and I can't help but think that's what the girl was trying to do in the picture.
I was looking at the one that said in Soviet Russia games make you stronger.
I can't get off of boobs and apparently neither can our chat room there's jokes about the res trans vibrator the ps3 controller that vibrates Tiger Claw saying that stylus is not a suppository put that down all these gems coming from chat.org that's not where you put a suppository suppositories go in your ass not your cooch some girls like to play with both
You ever heard of the shocker?
Yeah, but I was saying... It's not a suppository.
We're going to do a math lesson for DarkSakura.
Two plus one is fun.
Professor Layton in the case of the cantankerous clitoris.
I wish I'd taken a picture of the gesture that Rob made when he made his little addition thing.
That's not on my algebra final!
SolarFlare in our chatroom says, I thought Nintendo already knew about their products and porn.
They sell the rubbers for their Wiimotes.
Oh, Wii condom joke.
I like that.
You know what OLR needs?
We need a contest that's like best slash fiction involving Nintendo characters.
And it should just be as absurd as possible.
Do you think there's some good Mario games?
I've read absurd fan fiction.
Really?
Hey, Pantanos, it's the Super Mario Brothers Super Show!
What's it rated?
If it's M or A, then automatically we'll know it's something good.
It's M. Okay.
Okay, so Mario's rescuing the princess.
Thank you, Mario.
The kingdom is saved.
Now you will get a nice reward.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Oh, thank God this is a radio show.
Wow, the princess bent over.
Is Bowser going to just get Mario from behind while he's on?
I don't know.
One day later.
Shotgun wedding.
Nine months later.
She's in labor.
Those are labor pains you're hitting right now.
Oh, it's baby Luigi.
Oh, no.
And now baby Yoshi's coming out and baby Toad.
Mario Party 12.
Each pulls a train.
You know what's funny is that video's probably like six years old and we're just now playing this like it's something brand spanking new.
There's the link in chat so you guys can giggle with us.
And the 13-year-old that made that six years ago now has some web shockwave HTML5 job, you know, making tons of money.
Got his start in high school making Mario porn.
Why did Nintendo send a cease and desist to that?
That's my question.
That's tasteful.
Yeah, because they're calling up legal and they're like, they hang up the phone.
They're like, this is hot.
I'm going to wait.
I'm going to see how this ends.
Labor is not hot.
No, it's very disgusting.
Ranma says, Mario, you are not the father.
All right, let's move on, please.
Quick.
Loki, we need a news story, quick.
Something that doesn't involve boobs.
And Mario labor.
Okay.
So, apparently, there's this comment going around from EA Games President Frank...
Gabbo.
Heath believes that the future of the game industry will come from multiplayer games.
It says that EA is very comfortable moving the discussion towards how we make connected gameplay, be it cooperative or multiplayer or online services as opposed to fire and forget package goods only.
Single player, 25 hours and you're out.
Heath says, I think the model is finished.
Yeah, finish for them.
Basically, to translate this in layman's speak, he believes that games should have more of an online component, which they charge money for, and also more download content later on so that it extends the gameplay beyond 25 hours, which they charge money for.
and, you know, possibly some sort of massive multiplayer online service, which they would also charge more money for.
So, basically, who wants to charge more money for stuff?
Well, I mean, I hate to say it, but isn't there kind of maybe a hint of truth to this?
Like, because, you know, I think about, okay, well...
and DarkSakura.com.
Was there download content that ever came out on PlayStation 3 for it?
I think it was rumored.
But besides that, the trophies and the achievements kind of add to this more cohesive multiplayer experience on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
Granted, not every gamer is connected on their system, and some people are quite content playing the games by themselves, but even people that don't know how to get their...
X-Boxes online and stuff have probably at least played Bejeweled Blitz once in their life, right?
Yeah.
I just think that... No, I've never played it.
Yeah, this is kind of an excuse to say, oh, well, we don't need to worry too much about the single-player experience because people are just going to play the multiplayer experience.
And you haven't played Bejeweled Blitz, but you played Knights of the Clicky.
It's even worse.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which, by the way, I know I'm a little early, but F you to Knights of the Clicky, because it just deleted, like, three of my friends the other day.
Just like, oh.
Really?
Like, two of them are friends of mine I talk to every day.
Did you have to send a re-invite or something?
I didn't try that yet.
I was hoping it would fix itself.
Well, if they, do you know if they removed the game, like, deleted the game from their own profile?
Like, they've had enough.
They're getting intervention.
Oh, maybe.
I don't know.
One of them was X-Link, so, X-Link, did you delete the game?
What'd you do?
I don't know.
Yeah, he's still on mine, so that shouldn't happen.
No, see?
He probably just deleted me from his friends list.
He's like, I'm sick of all these vlogs and keyboard cat videos.
I'm just deleting Rob from my friends list.
That's probably what really happened.
Anyhow, now we'll get a phone call later for sure.
Oh, Rob, we still love you.
Alright, you better.
Here's another, speaking of multiplayer, places where multiplayer things are happening.
You know, this is the future, Loki.
PlayStation Home.
I mean, surely, this is what the guy from EA was talking about, right?
It was PlayStation Home was where the multiplayer is at.
Can you believe PlayStation Home has been out for two years?
That's right, a Sony press release came out this week celebrating the second birthday of PlayStation Home.
Over 17 million users have visited home.
For two minutes, and then they left.
I'm sorry.
Right.
They have participated in over 600 community events.
So what that means obviously is collectively those 17 million users played 600 community events.
Let's see.
Some of them were sponsored by game developers and so on.
Some of them were more unofficial.
Sodium 2 is coming out next spring.
and Conspiracy, a multiplayer spy puzzle game from Jet Set Games is coming out as well.
I just want to know when the furry sex lounge is coming out because that's... Let's just call it what it is.
I mean, why are we wasting our time?
Hello?
By the way, I tried to do the DDR thing.
Couldn't do it.
Home is the future.
Now it's time for some of you to visit our home.
Not literally.
We want you to send us emails and interact with us.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place for you to send us emails.
Dark Sakura dives into the email bag every week and reads some emails.
This is a great way to interact with us if you don't listen or can't listen live every Sunday night.
We always love emails.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com This was the email that was referred to earlier.
Hey Sky and DarkSakura, sorry Loki.
I don't know if you're able to purchase the WoW games at the moment at the awesome sale prices yet.
I didn't see any sale prices by the way.
I think it's done.
It'll be back.
It'll be back.
but here is an alternative it sounds like Jamie had a WoW account in the past so if Rob sends her a scroll of resurrection via Blizzard's website then he gets a free month when a month of paid game time is applied to Jamie's account including a 10 day non-restricted free trial Rob can simply buy Jamie a month of a game as a present no games or expansions will have to be purchased and play for 40 days and try out the new old world content just an idea from Horde House's podcast number one fan Flaco Jones
Flacco Jones, but that's okay.
Yeah, I think it's a great idea.
I can't believe I didn't even think of the Scroll of Resurrection, but that's a great idea.
The thing is, when was the last time it played?
If it was more than two months ago, I think you're eligible Okay Which, you're more than six months out, aren't you?
No, I think I'm actually a year out because I got Star Trek Online Didn't I get it last Christmas?
I don't know No, I didn't, I got it So, yeah, I think Star Trek Online came out in like February I think the beta test was going on last Christmas Yeah, so I've been playing Star Trek Online since it was in beta That was, Star Trek Online was in beta around the time you and I started dating, right?
Yeah, so I think it was last Christmas, so
I don't really give a shit about Worgen I'm gonna play a goat chick again
The Draenei are awesome, actually.
The Draenei were cool.
They're really cool.
I think they are probably the most underrated class in WoW, next to Dwarves.
It was my favorite.
Yeah.
Except that, you know, my whole problem, okay, here's what the problem I ran into was.
When I hit level 20, I was like, what the fuck do I do now?
I'm on, I'm off the island, I'm on this place on a boat, I'm on a boat!
In fact, I think I remember actually standing out and shouting, I'm on a boat.
But I don't know what to do now.
I don't know where anyone is.
I don't know what anyone's doing.
The only issue you would have is that the Draenei and the Blood Elf starting areas were the only areas that weren't changed with this new expansion.
So it's still on the same quests and everything.
But I have a level 20 Draenei already.
Oh, I guess that's true.
and DarkSakura.com.
I kind of dig that.
I mean, that's one of the things that I really, really like about Star Trek Online is that, first of all, I can play.
Except for playing a few things with some of my fleet friends, I've done all of my leveling myself.
I've done all my missions myself.
I like the missions because it's like, okay, well, you do this, oh no, this leads to this thing, and it's all in the same area.
My favorite mission that I've done to date is the one that I said was Silent Hill.
were, it's the stupid, most stupid next generation bad guys was the Davidians, the ones that were the psychic leeches that were just slightly out of phase with reality.
These blue glowing creatures.
And they figured a way back in, you have to go in the past, you have to go in the present, but they've screwed up the electronics in this old
Thanks for watching!
That was my favorite, but you get to this one point, and then you hear the voice, and another thing happens.
And that's why I like this, something that builds and builds and builds on top of each other, which is what I wasn't really getting out of World of Warcraft before.
Well, it's settled.
I'm going to get DarkSakura a 60-day WoW card as a Christmaka gift, and then it's a win-win situation because I won't have to hear as much Star Trek nerd chat on this show.
Hearts.
I was using it as a basis of comparison.
I give you shit because that's what I've been doing for the past nine years.
I know.
But my point is that that's the type of missions I like.
And if there's stuff like that now in World of Warcraft, because honestly, there really wasn't.
There was... It was like, okay, you take this... Kill deer and skin their corpses.
Yeah, that was really it.
But only one in every six deer has a skin, apparently.
Yeah.
Which they fixed that.
Whereas, if I have a scanning mission, it's beam to the planet, scan five of these items.
You're done.
And you run up to the items and you just scan them.
And that's it.
And I call those my free XP ones.
Oh, look at the pretty textures.
You know, things.
Ramma is starting the You Sold Out chants.
Tigerclaw says it's an excuse to get DarkSakura on Horde House.
And Deathwishing says, crack, Rob's buying Sakura a crack to get a free hit of crack.
And again, keep in mind, there's no guarantee I'll stick with it again because I am on Star Trek Online.
I'm in a fleet.
I play with Scottish men.
I love playing with my Scottish dudes.
Yes, but if you come to WoW, you can be in a guild full of gay men.
Oh, that is fantastic.
I don't know.
What wins, Scottish or gay?
Now, if I had Scottish gay, I would... Ewan McGregor.
Well, he's not gay, but he's there to dream.
That would be hot.
I went to my status screen.
My internal status screen now is going blink, blink, blink, blink because I just imagined Scottish and gay.
Do we have any gay Scots that listen to the show?
Please email us immediately.
DarkSakura wants to be your friend.
Send me voicemail.
My number is 555-4444.
All right.
Next email.
Ooh, Scottish and gay.
That's just hot.
Anyway.
um oh uh thought I'd bring to your attention an interesting BBC commentary airing the UK this evening while you won't be able to see it on iPlayer in the US I'm certain you'll be able to acquire it after airing courtesy of the torrential deluge of data sharing I see what you did there
I love it the link will direct you to an interview conducted by Eurogamer with the director of the show following an exclusive preview screening I'm going to pull up the article in a second it might be worth bringing the issues raised to a wider global audience although I'm sure like me your stance on this and the implications such issues placed on personal responsibility will remain unchanged keep up the good work, Nigel let me see what the article is
Every time I see the name Nigel, that XTC song goes into my head.
Making plans for Nigel.
I don't follow.
Didn't you listen to XTC?
No.
Let's see.
The article says... Oh, it's about video games being addictive.
I'm just going to quote this a little bit.
We spoke to director and producer Emike Onono about why Panorama chose to highlight the issue and thinks the industry should be less defensive about it.
Okay.
Leo22 played World of Warcraft for 12 hours per day for two years and calls it a disease.
That was your problem, dude.
Anyway.
Another email.
By the way, thank you, Nigel.
Give us a call sometime.
Leave us a voicemail.
What is going on with Shenmue 3?
Is there actually one coming out?
Thanks.
And this comes from Jesus.
J-E-Z-U-S How do you know it's not Jesus?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What is going on with Shenmue 3?
Is there one actually coming out?
Thanks.
On mobile phones in Japan.
I think there's like a Shenmue 3.
But otherwise, it's just a fanboy dream.
Keep on dreaming.
Keep hope alive.
And he emailed twice.
Nothing official.
No more Jesus.
I'm sorry, Jesus.
I'm Jewish.
Click.
If Jesus can't use his divine will to put it out, then it's never happening.
Because it's not divine.
Jesus should be able to take some extra copies of Final Fantasy XIV and turn them into Shenmue 3, right?
We're gonna get so much hate mail this week.
Is that like the water and the wine sort of?
It's all in good fun.
If you can't laugh it yourself, what can you laugh?
Get the tree trunk out of your ass.
No, come on.
Have fun.
Just teasing.
Just have a little fun.
I'm gonna get some wow.
I'm gonna get some... I feel rub.
I feel funny.
I feel dirty.
It'll burn for a couple days, but then it goes away.
My arm is itching.
Let's go to the FUs of the week.
I had a bunch of FUs leading up into something, but the only thing that I'm actually remotely bitter about, and it's more of a, wow, how could you think this, and it's completely shallow, so pardon me for being completely shallow, but, and again, I don't want to say FU this, because it's one of my friends, and I thought it was a really sweet gesture, but I don't wear a 3XL.
Uh-ohs.
That's like girl drama right there.
That's like asking a girl if she's pregnant.
Don't do that.
I don't even wear an XL.
My t-shirt size is large.
The only XL I wear is if I buy boys t-shirts because I have the rack of days.
You know, and the other thing, too, okay, this is kind of a long, drawn-out story, and I'm not going to go into it, and I completely misunderstood what my friend said.
Okay, one of my friends on Facebook was feeling angry because someone verbally belittled her for what she was wearing to an event.
And she said she was thinking, well, at least I have children and you don't.
Now, I thought it was, because, you know, I've been trying, I thought it was, okay, is that all the value a woman has?
What the hell kind of response is that to?
I have children and you don't.
She went back and explained it to me that it's, I have to pay for my children.
You don't have to pay for any children.
I have expenses that you don't.
I have responsibilities that you don't.
That's what she meant.
I didn't see it that way because I've been a little bitter.
Damn you, uterus.
One of her friends started going in three all caps locked posts, by the way, about, I've adopted all these children and I've had the court waive my costs and everything.
I was like, dude, what are you doing adopting children if you can't freaking afford them?
That's almost as bad, I mean, I guess you're trying to do something good, but, you know, and my response to her was, I don't care.
You're not my friend.
The person who made the first post, she's my friend.
You are not.
This isn't about you.
And so when I went to check on it an hour later, all of those posts were deleted.
Facebook, serious business.
But I'm saying, I'm saying, it's just like, that's leading up to this FU.
Nobody needs to know your personal shit.
We don't care.
If you're not our friend, we don't care.
Saying all of this stuff to make yourself be all holier than thou just makes you look bitchier than thou.
The end.
I like that, bitchier than thou.
That should be my drag name.
All right.
Loki, do you have any... Oh, where'd the FU music go?
It went away.
Loki, do you have FU music?
Or FUs to go with the music?
Uh, yeah, F.E.
the Comcast for having to put a new drop to our house, which is gonna take ten days.
Basically, it's the line that goes from the cable box out front to my house.
That's the one that's messed up, so I don't have internet for that much longer.
Thankfully, though, I have hacked my phone to be able to Wi-Fi tether to it, so I've had slow internet, but I'd rather have fast internet.
I also bought a DOCSIS 3 modem now, so it should be even faster when I do get it working.
That's it.
I don't have a whole lot actually.
My FUs are pretty, you know, just FU to not having enough money to take any extravagant holiday trips because I'm going to have an entire week off of work this year just due to situations and, you know, just me having extra PTO and them encouraging me to take it basically.
So I might have a whole week off and nowhere to go.
So FU to that fact.
I mean, there might be other things going on that will definitely take my time.
But FU to getting old and not having trips to take.
Salacious Pop, do you have any FUs?
FUs to buying something digitally and then not having it post to your banking until like seven days later and kind of screwing up the mental math of how much money you thought you had.
When you're on employment on a fixed budget and you expect something that you buy to just show up the next day.
And also F you to just playing a new type of social game and just be nervous about being inexperienced.
All right.
How about our KDM42?
Do you have any FUs?
FU to dry air and winter and how it makes my skin get all itchy and crappy and it's always sucky.
And FU to being behind on everything just because of work and all that kind of stuff.
All right.
FU to the winter.
I don't know.
Winter can be okay sometimes.
I don't like the changes my body goes through either.
All right.
Loki and myself have one more story a piece for you guys.
Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
But first, a couple quick stories for you guys.
What we were alluding to earlier when we were talking to Bobby and also, I think we may have made this joke during the show.
Apparently, a Cypress Hill backup singer is suing rock star Take-Two over Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
Yes, that's right.
Apparently, back in the day I guess, Michael Shag Washington, he I guess spoke with the developer and stuff about his troubled youth.
He claims that he met with Rockstar in 2003 to talk to them about his street life for their upcoming game, including a description of his troubled youth and specifics of how the teenagers in his gang rode around on bicycles.
Apparently he's saying...
He didn't even know that he's never seen San Andreas in action until July when his nephew was playing it.
The plaintiff had never seen the game.
He did not own or play video games.
The complaint admits, further explained upon examination of the images of CJ in comparison with his photo from that year and other evidence, it became clear that Rockstar had stolen his image and never paid him.
So now he's claiming he was asking for 25% of the profits from San Andreas, which were approximately $250 million.
So $75 million of that, I guess.
And Take-Two, of course, is saying that the case is completely without merit.
Now, part of me goes, like, crazy guy is very crazy, and I think we can all agree, this can't be based on his real life.
If this was his real life, having sex with hookers and then shooting him in the face, I mean, he'd be dead from the state.
The state would have executed him years ago.
You know, I'm sorry, but he wasn't the only person, I'm sure, that was in a gang that rode around on a bicycle.
I mean, come on.
And I don't think, you know, and I like how he says, oh, well, the character looked like me.
Well, the character can look like whatever you want because you can customize your character in the game.
Here's the other interesting thing is that, I mean, he claims that he filed the lawsuit and so he must, this meeting he had with Rockstar must not be fake.
Like, that must have actually happened, right?
Because otherwise it would be really stupid to file a lawsuit and that can easily be disproved that Rockstar never met with him.
But I wonder, like, maybe Rockstar met with a bunch of people and this is just like, it's called doing research.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It does.
And it's also, like, too late.
Isn't there, like, a statute of limitations?
I guess not.
Eh, probably not.
TigerClaw in our chatroom says, If the game is based on his life, then so is the hot coffee, if you know what I mean.
I don't think it's based on his life at all.
I mean, it doesn't sound like his meeting was in great detail.
It's fiction.
It was based on no one's life.
It's like when...
A person is going to play a wrestler in a movie so that person hangs out with other wrestlers to kind of know what a wrestler's life is like.
That doesn't mean that you model your character directly after somebody, right?
Don't they do this shit?
Don't actors do this shit all the time in movies, right?
Method acting.
I wouldn't think it's that much different.
Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and it has to do with something we reported on previously, an 8-bit remake of DJ Hero that was out there on the internet.
It has been taken down from the official website.
Why?
Because of a cease and desist letter from Universal Music Publishing Group.
There was a little bit of back and forth going between the creator, Eric Ruth, and the Universal Music Publishing Group, and you can read the whole exchange over at what...
PeakyMall.com, Blog.
It's PeakyGeek, whatever this is.
And the whole little exchange really strikes me as kind of unprofessional.
And I don't see any signatures in it.
I don't know.
I read this and I go, part of it reads like fanfic to me, but whatever.
For whatever reason, the game is now gone.
I mean, but you know what they say.
Once it hits the internet, it's always on the internet.
So it's not like you can't find this thing on torrent sites and so forth.
And honestly, the news about it getting taken down probably just makes more people want to download it because, ha, I have the file I'm not supposed to have.
It's just like why WikiLeaks is such a big deal.
Not to get on another tangent.
But people just like to have shit they're not supposed to have.
That's what it is.
It's EPing.
Anyhow, another interesting twist in the story, and Dark Tetsuya had mentioned this in our mod forum, and sure enough, it's either a heck of a coincidence, Eric Ruth is the real name of an artist that used to do Bomani-related things named DJ Potato, with an E.
And I can't remember if we ever had him on this show.
I don't think we did.
But I remember we banned one of his songs from the old station because it was so, so terrible.
And you'll just have to Google it if you want to find out about that.
But it's kind of funny that now and then, where are they now?
Barmani people five years later.
I don't know if that's the same Eric Ruth, though.
I know.
I'm thinking it's kind of a common name.
But then I go, well, games.
But I don't know.
Did DarkTetsuya have something else to show that or is that just a coinkydink?
Do I need to email DJ Potato and be like, is this you?
Is this you, brah?
Is this you?
We'll see.
So I'll have to see if there's anything else that comes out on that.
But otherwise, kind of interesting.
Where are they now, Bomani people?
Oh, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky are still doing that little podcast they started years ago.
And we had Iguana Girl on here a few weeks ago.
I know we've been talking about episode 400.
We're going to get a whole lot of the old people together.
That would be fun.
By the way, that's only seven weeks away.
We might want to start planning that.
Yeah.
Alright, that's it for the news.
We're done.
Let's go to the Skype line.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
All one word.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
The Skype line is now open for business.
and DarkTetsuya says it was in the readme.
It says DJ Potato with an E in the readme file.
So it is the same guy.
That's proof enough to me.
Interesting.
All right.
Maybe we should get him on the show.
I don't know.
But then I'm worried the topic of old songs will come up and then it'll get really awkward.
All right.
Solar Flare, we're not doing a marathon for episode 400.
Dream on.
All right.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We have a call coming in right now.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is X-Link.
Hi, X-Link.
What's on your mind, buddy?
You should know me.
I'm your friend from Facebook that didn't defriend you.
Well, apparently you somehow have left my circle of Knights of the Clicky friends, so I don't know what happened.
It's probably because I've been inactive because of a certain other clicky game that we're all too familiar with because we're also all in another guild called WoW.
I see.
So when WoW, when Kata came out, I kind of like totally abandoned all my Facebook games for a while.
But I'm pretty sure I have people on my Facebook who haven't played that game but the first time they ever played it.
Like did Marissa ever play past one day?
I doubt she did.
I don't know.
No, no, no, no, I do.
I seriously do.
It's just there's a lot going on, and I really prefer us getting all the little guild perks and stuff so we can get our 50% or 60% bonuses when we start killing stuff than, you know, playing Knights of the Clique and getting you a broadsword.
Alright, so I have to ask, how's Warcraft Cataclysm going for you since it was the big game release this week?
Well, it's going good since you got me addicted to it.
It was fine.
I went out and I always wanted to be in one of those lines during the midnight launching of something, so I decided to go see how it was.
It was very interesting.
It was very intriguing to see all the people QQing and cussing, I can't get in, what the fuck, and what the hell's going on?
It was just funny hearing the people bitch and moan for the first four or five hours of trying to get into the game and they can't get in and trying to become the first of different professions.
It was over in like ten minutes.
We ran Blackrock Caverns before 1am, but we were prepared to go.
You know what I mean?
There was a group of like five of us that we had emailed earlier in the day and it was like, okay, we're going to be outside the entrance to the dungeon at 11.59pm.
And then you're the one who, you're the one on your other podcast that went off and saying, talking about how I told you guys that you had to log out and you guys, you didn't really believe me at first.
And I'm like, yeah, there was a blue post that specifically stated if you're in game by the time that thing rolled around that you have to actually log out and then re-log back in.
Did you flip a magic switch like it's the cable company?
yeah well so anyway yeah but it whatever I mean yeah it was 10 minutes of nerd rage but then it was over and we were doing our quest it was fine but then you guys were doing your dungeons while I'm doing the new profession so
How is archaeology?
That's something I haven't even touched yet.
Archaeology is loads of fun, but it's very tedious and time-consuming.
It's because you jump from place to place to place, and they're all random.
So you could go halfway to the bottom of the continent and then have to fly all the way up to the top for another dig site.
So it can take a little bit, but supposedly there's going to be mounts and other items and pets.
I got, like, two pets so far.
I didn't get any of the mounts yet.
Alright, we'll see what happens.
Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
X-Link.
No, Dad, I'm one of the few people in your guild that's not gay, but that's okay.
I still love you anyways.
You can still fake a Scottish accent pretty good, right?
No, I cannot.
You're not even going to try?
No, not at all.
You're no fun at all, just so you know.
I'm sorry.
I just can't do a Scottish accent, that's all.
I understand you're not gay and you're very happy with your girlfriend and you're very secure and all that stuff, but you do like musicals, right?
Loki, do you have any last minute stories while we're waiting for the phone to ring?
TurboGrafx-16 emulation is coming to the iPod and iPhone.
They're going to be doing something similar to the Commodore 64 client that's out there.
It says you're going to get the actual emulator, which will come with Olympic-style World Sports Competition.
for free, and then each day Hudson will select one game from the library and make it available through the app for a free three-minute trial, and each individual game will be available for $3.99.
All right, let me go back to the phone.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Deathwishing.
Deathwishing.
What's on your mind, Deathwishing?
Besides being really tired because I rode 60 miles on my bike.
Wait, why'd you ride 60 miles on your bike?
because I'm working out.
I want to have big, huge quads.
I see.
Oh, you got to impress the ladies?
Yes, with my massive meaty legs.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
I see.
You got to have beefcake legs.
All right, that's fine.
All right, well, good luck with the bike riding.
Well, what's on your mind tonight?
What the hell is up with this grand shrivel?
I was at my friend's house.
I'm playing it, and I realized 200 cars are ungodly beautiful, and you can take pictures of them.
and it's almost like that's all the game is good for is taking pictures of cars and like wanking but I know it's like I'm going through 200 cars list and like wow these are beautiful all of a sudden I get to this one car and it looks like Playstation 1 it's like they made this great game and so the game is like a burger and then the bacon that's supposed to be wrapped around it is like 3 weeks old
Interesting analogy.
Do you think maybe possibly, I know this might be hard to believe, but do you think maybe a game company rushed the game to get it out at a certain time?
I mean, I know we didn't just have a story on that earlier in the evening, but do you think maybe they rushed this car and just made it out of triangles and basic shapes to get it in there?
I think they just got fed up with all these, like, oh, we have to push it back.
Oh, we gotta push it back.
We, uh,
messed up on a tire thing.
Our developer, he's a neat freak and he keeps on trying to make the cars look beautiful.
Then soon they're just like, fuck it, we'll make it so you can drive a go-kart backwards and win a race.
You know what would be awesome is that if Gran Turismo had more of a sense of humor and they put some funny cars in the game.
For instance, how about an old covered wagon with oxen could actually be one of the cars.
You have a river that you're trying to Ford to get across.
That could be an awesome car.
How about just one of those little Barbie jeeps?
Yes, a Barbie Jeep or a Flintstone car where the guys are running to get it to go.
I remember one of the old Need for Speed games had a bunch of different codes you could put in to race as different things.
And one of the things that they had, like a lot of them were background objects.
Like you could race as a log.
You could race as a T-Rex statue.
We used to have log races all the time.
It was awesome.
Or a log with the T-Rex chasing after you and like meter made cars and all sorts of crazy shit.
or we can race as the horse in Daytona.
Wait, I have a question.
When you would do the log races, would you actually all sing this song?
How could this song not wake you up?
I'm gonna put this on my alarm clock.
Wait, here's my favorite part.
Oh my god.
The only good cake song is the You Are A Pirate song.
I don't know the You Are A Pirate song.
Yes, you do.
The one that was a little... Do what you want because a pirate is free.
Do what you want because a pirate is free.
You are a pirate.
And it had the little dancing part in the middle.
That girl was like a 4chan loli icon, just saying.
I think this is the song I should put on my email client now when I get new emails.
That guy's like a D-list celebrity now.
They get pictures of him out and about in LA.
He has a fucking shirt at Hot Topic now.
Oh, I'm kind of like a mindfuck right now.
What?
Hide your wife, hide your kids, and hide your husband too, because they're raping everybody on out here.
He's raping everybody.
Have a good one.
Oh, by the way, if you're looking up songs like that, look up the Best Cry Ever autotune remix.
Is that the one that was on Saturday Night Live?
No, it's this video of this guy from that show, like Intervention or something, and he cries.
He's like, They parodied that on Saturday Night Live, didn't they?
Wait, hold on, hold on.
I think they did a parody of it.
Oh my god, what have I done?
Because I know, somewhere deep down in my heart That's what it is I still love you I still love you It's so sad but so funny
This guy seriously has a problem, but it's like, how do you cry like that?
I don't know.
Alright.
But hold on, wait, wait.
Someone needs their own call time.
Okay, that's fine, but I know this has nothing to do with video games, but I just wanted to say the best clip from Intervention, however, that they made was this.
It wasn't the autotune, it was this.
This program contains subject...
This is the best clip to ever come from Intervention.
I'm walking on sunshine.
Thank you for bringing the level of the show down tonight.
We really needed it, Deathwishing.
Okay, my IQ level dropped to like 50 now from all this.
Alright, well congratulations.
Alright, this story has a happy end.
Alright, bye Deathwishing.
What the fuck was that call, seriously?
Where's my OLR?
I want it back.
Who stole my OLR?
You're the one that went looking up the other intervention video, Rob.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
Do you have any other stories for us, Loki?
Wait, no, never mind.
We have other calls coming in I'd like to get to.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is Ziba.
Hi, Ziba.
How are you?
I'm doing well.
How about you?
Good.
Long-time listener, first-time caller, right?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You are like the best girlfriend ever.
That is an awesome gift.
Both of us have never had one.
And he's really into old stuff like that.
And I just wanted to ask you guys, what kind of games should I get?
Because...
I really don't know.
GreatGianaSisters.com
Okay, how are you going to put it off floppy when there's no floppy drives?
Actually, I found... Or floppy disks.
I found... I'm going to go to the best one.
Hey, do you got a five and a quarter floppy disk, Sak?
Goodbye.
Will you please let me finish?
Sorry.
Thrift stores.
Aha.
Smart lady.
Antique shops.
Yeah, or auctions.
If there's flea markets and auctions, a lot of times you can find old stuff there.
I don't know if you would actually find Commodore 64 games.
Those are really hard to find now.
whoever never do business on eBay with Trader Dan because he will rip you the fuck off keep in mind there's still a lot of Commodore 64 community out there you might even be able to find like a cartridge that has like a USB thing in the back like I don't even know like how these things there's got to be ways that you can get because I know there's a huge modding community out there
Delta Patrol
Thanks for watching!
so you gotta check that out and honestly just do some google searches like do like best Commodore 64 ROMs and even though you'll get to like some shady websites they'll have some pretty good suggestions you know there's a huge retro community for the Commodore 64 out there and you'll find some stuff you like so alright that sounds good
awesome well you are like the best girlfriend ever just so you know like not that I know from like dating you but just the fact that you bought your boyfriend a Commodore 64 as a gift I bet like there's lots of our male listeners right now they're like I want a girlfriend like that I want a girlfriend like that so well I hope he likes it alright I'm sure he will he better or gosh he sucks alright no I'm sure it'll be great alright Ziba you take care and good luck
Alright, thank you.
And let us know if you find anything that's like a newfangled adapter for the Commodore 64, let us know.
I will.
Alright, later.
Bye.
Bye bye.
Counter 64s are so awesome, but damn Loki bringing logic into this and this whole like, well, you can't make five and a quarter floppies anymore.
Yes, you can.
All right.
Well, yeah, thrift store.
That's right.
I might even, hell, if I could find my drive, I would just send it to Ziba.
I would just be like, you know what?
You've listened to the show long enough.
Let's just, congratulations.
You're a winner.
Here's a prize.
If I could find it, but I can't.
I'd wonder what Windows would do with that.
I'd be like, no.
No.
No.
We're going to close up the Skype line for now and get some other last minute stories here and then we're going to wrap it up for tonight because it's already midnight on the East Coast.
So do you have any other stories for us, Loki?
Yeah, just real quick.
Wolfenstein 3D, they've recreated it in LittleBigPlanet 2 using the really incredible creation engine.
I mean, it's just amazing the stuff.
Someone actually built a ray casting engine within LittleBigPlanet 2.
I saw the video of that.
And even though it kind of looks junky, just the fact that they pulled it off is amazing.
The fact that they pulled off a recasting engine, yeah, it's just nuts.
So that's going to be an awesome game when it comes out.
Only a month away.
Actually, a few weeks.
That's awesome.
I can't wait to play.
That's it.
That's it?
That's all I want to talk about.
All right, that's fine.
Any other last-minute stories from anyone else in the studio?
Alright, well then this is the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up for the night.
Arcadian42, since you're holding the mic, thank you for being here.
I hope you had fun laughing along with us and reminiscing about some Sega.
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
Uh, Delta Patrol.
If you ever find it, it's awesome.
Hopefully someone has it on YouTube or find a soundtrack at least if you can.
I'm sure it's on YouTube somewhere.
Well, I don't know something that long, but if you find it, it's a pretty cool soundtrack.
I'm trying to look right now.
No, but I found some chicks.
My Twilight soundtrack redone.
I don't know what that has to do with Delta Patrol.
There you go.
All right.
Salacious Pop, thank you as always for being here in the studio.
Appreciate it.
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
Everyone send me employment vibes.
I don't know how you do that.
Alright.
Let's see.
I'll go next.
My final thought is man, I wish pink berries were open this late because I could use some fro-yo.
DarkSakura and her knitting self over there.
I'm crocheting.
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
This silk bamboo yarn is really fucking difficult to use and really tiny.
And I wish that my friend had picked out a thicker yarn for me to make her scarf out of.
But it's silk bamboo.
It is really nice.
It was on sale too.
All right.
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.
my final thought is I wish my internet was backup I can't even imagine like thank gosh you have a baby to entertain you because like if you didn't have that I don't know what you know thank god I have my phone that I can you know tag onto the Wi-Fi for that and at least browse the internet downloading is out of the picture but browsing the internet is at least tolerable with that
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
We will be back next week.
I can't remember if the conversation was on or off air, but there was a thought that we might not be here next week, but we are going to be here next week.
That was all worked out.
So we're going to be back next week.
We're creeping closer to the year end.
Actually, next week will be our last show before Christmas.
No, there will be one more show before Christmas.
I can't do math.
Next week is the last show before Christmas, and then I will be out of town after that.
DarkSakura
That remains to be seen.
Wow.
Because Dan really wants to go to Washington to see the family.
Sure, sure.
But I can say no need to go back.
So last week will be the last OLR.
for a little while so not that bad guys don't worry just for the holidays so we'll be back next week to wrap up the year and all that stuff with more news and you guys of course we are the show where every gamer has a voice you guys if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio remember we don't play commercials we don't beg for money all we beg for
