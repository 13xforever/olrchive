0	19600	Tonight, December 5th, 2010, video evidence shows the PSP phone may be the real deal.
19600	24920	PETA parodies Super Meat Boy to a strong response, and the video game song finally gets nominated
24920	32280	for a Grammy.
32280	36440	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36440	37440	Radio.
37440	39720	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
39720	47880	We are live on this December 5th of 2010 at www.allgames.com for the 392nd episode of
47880	48880	our show.
48880	49880	That's a lot of shows.
49880	50880	Alright, my name is Rob Roberts.
50880	53780	I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games with my awesome
53780	57080	co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
57080	59080	I have a little dreidel.
59080	60080	Is it made out of clay?
60080	61080	I don't know.
61080	62080	Yes.
62080	63080	Alright.
63080	64080	No, mine was wood.
64080	65760	Happy Hanukkah, Ms. Summers.
65760	66760	Thank you.
66760	67760	How long have you been celebrating Hanukkah?
67760	70720	Did you do anything besides light some fire?
70720	72840	I went to Temple and Dan went with me.
72840	73840	Oh, wow.
73840	74840	Okay.
74840	76840	Yeah, and we had lots of fire.
76840	77840	Nice.
77840	82780	Everyone brought their hanukiah, which is the hanukkah menorah.
82780	84880	And we lit candles on fire.
84880	85880	Good times.
85880	86880	It was gorgeous and very warm.
86880	87880	Well, is there any rock band?
87880	91880	Because I know you're, and for those that are new to OLR, Dark Sakura went through the
91880	95000	whole Judaism conversion, what about a year ago you probably started this?
95000	96000	Maybe a year and a half?
96000	97000	I started it in last July.
97000	99200	Okay, so it's been a little while.
99200	103160	But I know like now she has a lot of new friends through the Jew school, basically is what
103160	104160	I call it.
104160	107080	And the Jews love rock band.
107080	109640	So I'm kind of curious if you've gotten your rock band on during-
109640	111400	Well, my friends do.
111400	114920	Because that's the one thing I noticed, I came over once I think for Jamie's birthday
114920	117360	and you know, all the Jew school friends were here.
117360	119520	And they were loving some rock band and I was like, okay.
119520	120960	I didn't really play much rock band.
120960	126200	I've actually, I'm not going to be doing a lot of gaming for the next week and a half.
126200	129240	Because number one, Dan has Gran Turismo 5.
129240	131240	And number two, finals.
131240	132240	Bummer.
132240	133240	Yeah.
133240	134240	Busy week.
134240	135360	Bummer on both counts.
135360	136360	I'm just kidding.
136360	137360	I'm not hating on Gran Turismo 5.
137360	138360	I am.
138360	140000	Just to be serious, I'm not very good at the-
140000	141000	I'm angry.
141000	142000	I'm angry.
142000	143000	I'm angry.
143000	144000	I'm angry.
144000	145000	I'm great at arcade razors like Mario Kart and-
145000	148160	How can the Veyron not be a premium car?
148160	149160	IDK.
149160	150160	Bastards.
150160	151160	All right.
151160	153280	Also say hello to, we got to introduce tech master, Loki.
153280	154280	Hello.
154280	155280	How are you?
155280	156280	Loki?
156280	157280	I'm doing fine.
157280	158280	Oh, alrighty.
158280	159280	Good to hear it.
159280	160280	I know you're not, well no, your wife celebrates Hanukkah.
160280	161720	So have you been doing anything for that?
161720	162720	No.
162720	163720	No?
163720	164720	All right.
164720	167720	You're more of a, like a Chrismakka kind of family though, right?
167720	168720	A little bit?
168720	169720	Yeah.
169720	170720	Really.
170720	171720	Yeah.
171720	172720	Yeah.
172720	173720	That's the retail Christmas.
173720	174720	There you go.
174720	175720	That works.
175720	176720	What are you, what are you knitting over there, Dark Stock?
176720	178400	Are you making arts and crafts at OLR?
178400	182640	Um, I'm making a hat for a present for a friend who wants a hat.
182640	186240	And I'm, I took some leftover yarn and made myself a knit headband so I could be trendy.
186240	190880	You could make one of those in like an orange color and probably sell it for like 20 bucks.
190880	193160	I know, there you go.
193160	194560	Maybe this is something I could do while I'm not working.
194560	198320	I also do want to take a moment to poll our listeners and send us an email.
198320	199320	Sure.
199320	201440	It's on our website at orangelandradio.com so Rob can read it.
201440	202440	Okay.
202440	203440	Wait a minute.
203440	208720	Hey, um, who would be interested in an Orange Lounge book?
208720	210240	I got a text message about this.
210240	213360	I want to know more about your thoughts on this.
213360	214840	Why you suddenly want to do a book.
214840	219040	Well, I'm sure the not having a job right now has a lot to do with that.
219040	222600	To commemorate our fans and how, talk how awesome we are.
222600	223600	Would it be a pop up book?
223600	225280	Cause I'm not good with writing.
225280	229900	It would be a physical book to be ordered or an ebook.
229900	230900	An ebook.
230900	232600	Can it be something I listen to on my iPod?
232600	233600	Cause that makes sense.
233600	234920	Cause you know it is a radio show.
234920	242960	No, it's a physical book with pictures and links to goodies.
242960	244960	It's like the OLR yearbook.
244960	245960	And Easter eggs.
245960	246960	Alright.
246960	249040	Alright, well I got, I got to see what this is all about.
249040	254200	You know, one of, one of the other shows on all games does a magazine, the Electric Sisterhood
254200	259800	I think it is, does the magazine and I apologize if I'm misappropriating that, but you know,
259800	261960	it's been done where the shows move into other mediums.
261960	264160	So sure, OLR can have a book.
264160	265160	Why not?
265160	268600	I think Michelle on the Outsiders shows has a book deal, but I don't think it has anything
268600	270360	to do with her shows.
270360	272640	You know the, um, what is that site?
272640	273640	Oh God.
273640	276120	It's been everywhere and it's, it's her and her sister's site.
276120	278080	Uh, damn you autocorrect.
278080	279080	That's it.
279080	280080	Have you seen that site?
280080	281080	That's her site.
281080	282080	Oh.
282080	283600	And I think she's got a book now going on about it.
283600	284600	So you know.
284600	285600	Cool.
285600	288280	If, if all these other all games people can do a book, so can we.
288280	289280	Damn it.
289280	290280	Why not?
290280	292080	Alright, anyway.
292080	293280	Ours just won't be as good.
293280	294280	Okay, anyway.
294280	295280	I'm designing it.
295280	296280	It'll be amazing.
296280	297280	Oh.
297280	298280	Well, what'd you see?
298280	299280	I just got kicked in the face.
299280	300280	Alright, anyway.
300280	303400	Uh, all books aside, let's talk about video games and the games we've been playing this
303400	304400	week.
304400	306200	Dark Sakura, what types of games have you been playing this week?
306200	307200	Nothing.
307200	308200	Nothing?
308200	312840	Well, actually Star Trek Online because I'm updating the Tribble server right now.
312840	321960	At, like, 1K, so, um, I, uh, well, I played some solitaire.
321960	326680	I've been very busy because, um, the American River Review, which is the magazine that I've
326680	329760	done some design for, goes to print on Monday, and we had-
329760	331760	This is where the book idea's coming from.
331760	336240	No, actually, I got the idea from the book I did for my client because we just published
336240	337240	it.
337240	338240	Oh, okay.
338240	339240	Um, it was really easy.
339240	341960	So, uh, it'd be very easy for us to do a book.
341960	344180	But back to, back to, uh, this.
344180	349240	The American River Review, um, and as soon as we have the order information up, I'll
349240	355240	be linking it to everybody, because you have to buy a copy, um, but the American River
355240	361920	Review is, uh, all of the, uh, literature, the art, digital, physical media, fashion
361920	366760	and culinary for, um, American River College for 2011.
366760	367880	We win tons of awards.
367880	370060	We beat out big schools.
370060	371060	We are amazing.
371060	373320	I did the culinary section.
373320	375920	I designed it anyway.
375920	381320	And, um, I think it's, it's definitely, you know, something that anybody should have a
381320	384080	copy of because it really is an impressive product.
384080	385080	And we had our proofs.
385080	389160	We got our proofs last week, and so that's what's been taking up my time instead of games.
389160	391120	But you said the hubby's been playing Gran Turismo 5, right?
391120	393040	Oh, well, when we did have some Scott Pilgrim.
393040	394360	Oh, fun.
394360	395360	Yeah.
395360	397240	Uh, what is, is Gran Turismo 5 pretty?
397240	400120	Yes, except for the shadows are retarded.
400120	402120	A little early for that music.
402120	403320	Pretty as in that music.
403320	404320	As in that music?
404320	405320	Is this as pretty as that music?
405320	408040	Some of the music in the game is very elevator-y.
408040	409640	I, I just want to say-
409640	412160	Well, there's new My Chemical Romance in there that makes me happy.
412160	415200	Dark Soccer gave me a beer before tonight's show, so if things are a little bit off tonight,
415200	418640	like what just happened, you know what, just, just roll with it.
418640	419640	How's it off?
419640	421640	This always happens.
421640	427320	Well, at any rate, at any rate, um, it's, it's got some stuff that needs to be fixed.
427320	431640	I still hate that all the people around the track are like, we're just standing here,
431640	434360	we are stiff, we don't do anything but wave.
434360	438760	And I'd like to see more stuff going around, because, because the game can handle it, it's
438760	439760	just not.
439760	440760	And then-
440760	443080	You want to see some women flashing their titties as you drive by.
443080	444080	That's what, that's what the game needs.
444080	450120	It is, the cool thing in this game is that it has the, um, the Top Gear test track, and
450120	451340	the Stig.
451340	454600	And your driver looks kind of like the Stig from Top Gear.
454600	458480	But it doesn't have Rainbow Road, which is really disappointing.
458480	459900	It does have go-karts.
459900	464000	It would be awesome if they just, you know, cuz, come on, it's Gran Turismo, they take
464000	469520	themselves way too damn seriously, um, just throw in some wacky shit in there, it's like,
469520	472040	you know, we're driving in space now.
472040	478320	I mean, cuz it's a real, a realistic sim racing game, but just put it in some very unrealistic
478320	482440	situations and have fun.
482440	486400	Gran Turismo 6, in space!
486400	489240	At any rate, it is, uh, very British.
489240	494320	Um, and I really can't describe that other than just saying, watch the game, it's very
494320	495320	British.
495320	499400	Um, I totally laughed my ass off at the rally section, because Dan was trying to beat the
499400	502280	rally cars, you know, focus.
502280	507640	And uh, well I mean, that's a good rally car, so, but I was like, very hard, easy right?
507640	514640	You know, making, doing the, the Sega touring, or Sega rally voiceover, so it was pretty
514640	515640	funny.
515640	519000	Um, they're supposed to be doing a patch that's supposed to fix a lot of the problems, so,
519000	520000	we'll see.
520000	523080	I just sit in there sometimes and listen to the elevator music and usually I fall asleep
523080	525380	while Dan's playing.
525380	526380	So that's it.
526380	528920	Alright, let's go over to Loki!
528920	530640	How was your gaming week?
530640	534400	Doing, uh, you know, not too much gaming this week.
534400	540400	Uh, mainly though, been playing, uh, this is kind of funny, it's an iOS game called
540400	548000	Swords in Poker 2, and it's, it's really like, it's like a chibi role playing game, but the
548000	552800	whole battle system, not so much, I mean kind of like puzzle quests I guess, they, you have
552800	560080	a grid of, um, you start off with a grid of five by five, and then um, in the middle there's
560080	567520	a grid of, uh, three, three by three poker cards, and the whole goal is to make up different
567520	572460	poker hands, and by doing that you do specific amounts of damage to the monster that you're
572460	577240	attacking, and then, you know, the monster does the same thing as well, and you can charge
577240	582880	up a wild card and stuff, and then they have different magic that you can cast that rearranges
582880	587340	some of the cards or does different things, or, um, you know, shields that block certain
587340	589160	damage and stuff like that.
589160	590160	It's actually really fun.
590160	591160	I've been playing...
591160	593480	Is it a free game, or when you had to pay, or what?
593480	595240	Um, no, it does cost money.
595240	596240	Okay.
596240	598600	I don't know how much money, but it costs money.
598600	599600	Alright.
599600	603800	Um, and yeah, very awesome game, so I've been playing that most of the week, and then other
603800	608000	than that, just probably, uh, Grand Theft Auto.
608000	609360	That's pretty much it.
609360	614960	Go into our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, there's a little bit of chatter going on with
614960	617240	our ever-present fourth guest on the show, you guys.
617240	621120	Uh, lots of talk on Gran Turismo 5, Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, Gran Turismo 5 looks
621120	625360	so amazing, can't help but be mesmerized by the graphics as I watch people play the game
625360	626360	on Justin.tv.
626360	631480	And Justin.tv, from what I remember when we were doing our video feed on there, uh, in
631480	632760	the old studio, it doesn't...
632760	637480	It's not like it has the best quality, so if that still comes across really well, uh,
637480	638480	that's pretty amazing.
638480	642560	Um, Dart Datsuya says, reminds me, whatever happened to the Gran Turismo kids' things
642560	643720	they were supposedly doing?
643720	645120	I don't even remember that.
645120	647360	Wait, Loki just kind of did this, ah, bleh.
647360	648360	Hey, it'll never happen.
648360	649360	Who cares?
649360	650360	It stinks.
650360	651360	It'll be coming out soon.
651360	653960	By soon we mean six years, I don't know.
653960	654960	Alright.
654960	659720	Uh, let's see, and, uh, some of the folks in chat are talking a little bit about Gran
659720	660880	Turismo songs.
660880	666320	Uh, DJ Dark Knight says, need Kickstart My Heart, the best Gran Turismo song ever.
666320	671600	And Dark Datsuya says, actually, that's the first song on my Gran Turismo 3 playlist.
671600	675440	So, hm, a lot of talk about the soundtrack of Gran Turismo.
675440	676440	Have you noticed the soundtrack?
676440	677440	It's got new...
677440	679480	Well, I said earlier it has New My Chemical Romance in there.
679480	680480	Oh, that's right.
680480	681480	That's right.
681480	682480	You were talking about all that.
682480	683480	Well, once...
683480	685080	That's a nova!
685080	689400	One song that I do not believe is on the Gran Turismo 5 soundtrack, but is in a game we're
689400	691480	gonna be talking about a little later tonight, is...
691480	694640	I believe you made me want to stay.
694640	698800	That's right, that Happy Hardcore song from Techno Kitten Adventure.
698800	701720	It's Sea of Love by Frisco, if you wanted to know who it is.
701720	705960	Uh, you might remember last week on the show, we got a tweet saying that we needed to check
705960	711480	out this game called Techno Kitten Adventure, and, uh, we were laughing our ass off, because
711480	712480	it's just awesome.
712480	715280	Like, you know, laughing with them, not at them.
715280	721200	Uh, it's, you know, as people who play DDR for years and years, um, you know, this type
721200	725800	of music's right up our alley, and the fact that this whole music video is, uh, interactive,
725800	729280	and, you know, when they talk about touching the sky, there's actually a little finger
729280	731040	that comes down and touches the sky.
731040	732040	Like, shit like that is hilarious.
732040	735480	So this game's a dollar, and it's on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
735480	738960	We're gonna have the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure on the show tonight.
738960	743520	That's right, from tweet to on-air interview in one week, it's amazing what can happen
743520	744520	here at OLR.
744520	747960	We're gonna have Nick from Techno Kitten Adventure at 7 o'clock, that's just over 30 minutes
747960	748960	away.
748960	749960	That's exciting.
749960	752480	Loki, you checked out Techno Kitten Adventure, huh?
752480	754040	You thought it was a little basic.
754040	761880	Uh, yeah, I played it a little bit, um, I don't know, it's similar to, I guess, like
761880	766800	the robot unicorn attack games, where the concept's very simple, but what draws you
766800	771920	into the game is just the fact that it's so unusual, I guess.
771920	772920	Mm-hmm.
772920	773920	Mm-hmm.
773920	777160	But, I mean, the gameplay itself, it's all one button, you just, you know, a button to
777160	779720	control the thrust on a jetpack.
779720	785800	I just, I don't know, if I were to improve something upon the game, I would maybe tighten
785800	791560	up the controls a little bit, at level 3, um, and then also, uh, maybe, you know, make
791560	792560	it a little harder.
792560	797080	Well, we're gonna ask him if there's any plans for a sequel, because, uh, the game has shown
797080	800440	up in the top games on Xbox Live Indie Games, right?
800440	801440	It's there.
801440	805440	It's not like the number one game, but it's not number 500, it's there.
805440	807520	So we definitely wanna ask him about that.
807520	811320	And I played the game as well, and, you know, even though it is as basic, let's say, as
811320	817080	an Atari 2600 game, I think, in fact I'm pretty sure I played a game like this on Atari 2600,
817080	824480	I think the environment that he created and just the, um, you know, absurdity, outside
824480	829000	the box type of thinking he constructed the game around is clearly this, wouldn't this
829000	833720	be funny if I combined X with Y and made Z, and I think it really works, especially for
833720	834720	a dollar.
834720	835720	It's a dollar.
835720	836720	Rob.
836720	837720	Rob, what?
837720	839160	Dear, please don't say combine X, Y, make Z.
839160	840160	Why?
840160	841160	Algebra, hell.
841160	844800	Are you having, are you having, uh, flashbacks to school?
844800	845800	Ahhh!
845800	846800	Alright, now.
846800	848080	That's what my final's in.
848080	852480	If 2X plus Y equals Z, solve for kitten.
852480	853480	Meow.
853480	858560	Alright, so we're gonna talk a little bit about that, and I wanna know if he has any
858560	862040	other games on the marketplace as well, so we have to ask him all those questions, and
862040	864280	I think it's worth it for one whole dollar.
864280	867320	It's, it's the type of game you're gonna whip out a party and, like, look at what I
867320	868320	downloaded.
868320	869320	Bobby's giving Loki a hard time.
869320	870320	Why's that?
870320	871320	In chat?
871320	872320	You can't get more tight than one flippin' button.
872320	875000	Well, you know, we were talking to Bobby, and of course, Bobby Blackwolf is the gentleman
875000	878840	that does the show before us at All Games Radio, the Bobby, Bobby, the Blobbly, the
878840	885680	Bobby Blackwolf show, uh, every Sunday night at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, and he always has
885680	888680	us on at the very end of the show, which is very nice, he doesn't have to do that, but
888680	893000	we were talking about this game a little bit, and, uh, we were kind of talking about how
893000	898160	– we like that somebody went there and did this and didn't just try to make a, a clone
898160	904840	of some other game, because we're all about the whole kind of, like, absurd, outside-the-box
904840	905840	sorts of ideas.
905840	908120	Remember President Cat a year and a half ago?
908120	910280	Why were we all excited about President Cat?
910280	912600	It wasn't really the game itself, per se.
912600	916200	I'm sure the game itself was really just an average game, and I think a lot of the
916200	920400	blogs who ultimately reported on, wow, there's this podcast trying to get this game called
920400	924880	President Cat localized, what a bunch of weirdos, haha, I don't think they ever got that the
924880	928720	reason behind that wasn't necessarily the game itself, it was the fact that you look
928720	932320	at the Wii's lineup, and they're all clones of each other.
932320	938640	You know, it's, it's Nick Jr. games, and PopCap ripoffs galore, and Wii Sports ripoffs,
938640	940840	it's all the same damn thing.
940840	943840	President Cat, for what it's worth, was something different.
943840	948920	You play this cat driving a car and running a company, and it's, it's like that old,
948920	949920	uh –
949920	950920	Just playing the piano.
950920	953400	Yes, and absolutely playing the piano.
953400	956040	Why can't we get original shit like that?
956040	960080	You know, why do we have to get these games we know are sub-par and below?
960080	961800	It's just, I don't know.
961800	962800	Because we're America!
962800	963800	Yeah, I know.
963800	964800	Fuck you, man.
964800	965800	For everything is mediocre.
965800	966800	Ugh.
966800	967800	Alright, so anyway.
967800	971280	Oh yeah, uh, Majinma Khan in our chatroom says, uh, Muscle March.
971280	974240	That was a pretty unique Wii game, I will say that.
974240	978000	There was at least that, so, uh, it's, it's working.
978000	982000	Anyhow, uh, so we'll get to, uh, more talk on Techno Kitten Adventure in about 30 minutes,
982000	985480	but in the meantime, uh, my gaming week, I didn't talk about my gaming week, I, I guess
985480	988960	I mentioned Techno Kitten Adventure, and, uh, I didn't play a whole lot else.
988960	991800	I played quite a bit of World of Warcraft, because there's big changes going on this
991800	995620	week, but, um, you know, I have the other show for that now, uh, so not a whole lot
995620	1000520	I want to say here, uh, otherwise other games I played some more Super Meat Boy, uh, which
1000520	1004400	I think is a great Xbox Live Arcade game, and, um, that was really about it.
1004400	1007280	I had a work trip this week, so I didn't really get to play a whole lot of games at
1007280	1008280	home.
1008280	1010400	So, sorry guys, I'll try to play more next week.
1010400	1016060	Anyhow, uh, housekeeping tonight, join our Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge
1016060	1020520	radio, and of course our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, we'll be taking Twitter topics
1020520	1025520	later in the show, so definitely submit those topics, and, uh, email, email our show, mailbag
1025520	1029200	at orange lounge radio dot com, Dark Soccer's gonna read those in part B a little later
1029200	1030240	in the show.
1030240	1034080	For now though, we're gonna get into the news, Loki's gonna start us off tonight with some
1034080	1035080	gaming news.
1035080	1045320	Oh yes, um, so, you know, it was funny because they were actually, uh, quoting, uh, one of
1045320	1052080	the quotes made about this device, allegedly, was that, where there's smoke there's fire,
1052080	1055520	well, I don't think you can get much more fire than this.
1055520	1062440	Uh, the Playstation phone, of course, remember a while back they had some not so clear video
1062440	1067920	of, you know, the device, and people were like, well, you know, it's probably changed
1067920	1073740	quite a bit since then and whatnot, but now they have really clear video, um, showing
1073740	1081800	this brand new, uh, device called the Sony Ericsson, uh, Zeus Z1 Playstation phone, and,
1081800	1088120	uh, it kinda shows some of the features it has, the slide out controls, the, you know,
1088120	1095120	dual kind of, uh, touchpad thing on the front that simulates the analog sticks, uh, of course,
1095120	1101160	you know, the shoulder buttons as well, um, something that looks like, uh, it made possibly
1101160	1108660	a front and back mounted camera, um, lots of neat stuff though that you would expect
1108660	1113480	in, like, a Playstation phone, um, and they even had some video, of course, showing them
1113480	1117720	going to, like, the actual Playstation mode where, um, you could play different games
1117720	1121560	and stuff, of course, there's no games loaded on there, so, couldn't really do anything
1121560	1127040	with that, um, but it's very interesting to see all this stuff, considering that they've
1127040	1133360	kinda been denying, you know, oh, yeah, we're not working on a Playstation phone. Obviously,
1133360	1136860	something I would be willing to bet you'll see at CES, cause they, like, shown off this
1136860	1141600	new hardware stuff and, you know, it seems right up their alley. Here's the question
1141600	1146880	I gotta ask about this, is this the same thing as the PSP2? Because we've heard rumors about
1146880	1151800	a PSP phone, and we've heard rumors about a PSP2, and my question is, is it actually
1151800	1156700	the same thing? Because I thought the rumors about there being, um, sliders on the back
1156700	1160600	and all this other weird stuff that we're seeing in this video was for the PSP2. And
1160600	1166040	now that you mention it, that does make sense, the one, the not so clear video or pictures
1166040	1170700	that we saw before were of the Playstation Portal 2. Of course, we've seen some pictures
1170700	1177160	before of the Playstation phone, but they're different. You know, just in the design of
1177160	1181560	how they are and stuff, they look different. I mean, this is a little bit similar to, like,
1181560	1186360	the PSP Go, almost. And it does look like a phone. I mean, the slide-out keyboard, you
1186360	1189880	know, you could almost replace that with a keyboard and be it, you know, just a normal
1189880	1194120	Sony Ericsson phone. Could it, again, I hate to harp on this, but do you think that maybe
1194120	1200680	the PSP2 is just this without the phone? Like an iPod touches to an iPhone? Um, possibly.
1200680	1206200	And that would make sense. I mean, that would be, it would make sense, I would think. Um,
1206200	1210440	I don't know if it's gonna be, I don't know if I really care for the idea that it has,
1210440	1214640	like, a touchpad on the back of the device. I mean, I think nowadays you kinda almost
1214640	1218120	have to have everything as, like, a touch screen, you know. You can pet it and caress
1218120	1222560	it from the back. Well, it's just. You can literally reach around your PSP and rub it
1222560	1226880	a little. I just don't understand, I think it would be very awkward to have a touchpad
1226880	1233120	on the back. I mean, cuz, I don't think that would lend itself well to the games, um, unless
1233120	1237920	it's just some sort of, you know, context sensitive touchpad or something like that,
1237920	1241320	in addition to other things. Maybe it knows when you're getting frustrated and you're
1241320	1244660	about to choke your system. Like, you know how, like, sometimes you'll clench your grip
1244660	1247720	a little bit when you're getting very angry? And I've been playing a lot of Super Meat
1247720	1253160	Boy lately, so I'm very familiar with this. Like, rah! Nerd rage! Throw my controller.
1253160	1257320	Totally go off topic. Super Meat Boy now on the Xbox 360. Do you have any of the downloadable
1257320	1260960	characters or any additional characters in the game? I've only unlocked one. That's how
1260960	1266120	terrible I am at it. I can't get the bandages. I have, like, four bandages. I got the guy
1266120	1271440	that's Bit.Trip Adventure. Oh, okay. Or whoever he is. I have him. He's in one of the warp
1271440	1275560	zones. I just saw some videos. I think it's PC only, though, of the Minecraft guy. It
1275560	1285760	is PC only. I'd heard about that, yeah. Talk about cheap. But, yeah, so, I mean, definitely,
1285760	1288760	there's no question that this is going to be coming out at some point. I think they're
1288760	1292720	going to announce it at CES because it just makes sense. You know, consumer electronics
1292720	1298220	show. That's a really good theory is that this is CES and then the PSP2 is E3. Yeah.
1298220	1302200	That's a really good theory. Because it does seem things with the PSP have been very quiet.
1302200	1308840	I mean, outside of the Kingdom Hearts and God of War, you know, a couple huge releases.
1308840	1314160	You know, the Go kind of stopped, pun intended, the PSP chat for a little while. Because the
1314160	1320360	Go, no matter how Sony or the fans try to spin it, was a miserable failure. There's
1320360	1326860	not a lot of stuff coming out from Sony for the PSP any time soon. Other than, the only
1326860	1334760	thing I've seen was Potapon 3. Which, so what? I mean, the second one that you were selling
1334760	1340960	as a download title. I mean, so, I don't really know if that's a lot to talk about. That could
1340960	1345040	be the very last game they have in development for the original PSP. It could be just all
1345040	1349260	now PSP2 stuff. And I don't know if this would actually be marketed as a PSP phone. To me,
1349260	1352760	it happens to be, I mean, it's not branded as a Sony PlayStation Portable. It's branded
1352760	1358760	as an Ericsson. Granted, it's a prototype. But, it still strikes me as, oh, it's this
1358760	1366920	phone that happens to have PSP playing capabilities. Just like, there was that GameCube that was
1366920	1370520	marketed as a DVD player that happened to play GameCube games. But they didn't call
1370520	1374400	it a GameCube. The Panasonic Q? Yes, that's right. The Panasonic Q. Thank you. Yeah. That's
1374400	1379400	what I was trying to think of. Japanese only. Yeah, so, I mean, this is definitely coming.
1379400	1383480	And it kind of makes sense, because there was also a few patents that they filed from
1383480	1391780	Sony. It says, you know, some two finger touch devices. And this is saying that there's some
1391780	1399160	sort of track pad, you know, the rumored track pad on the back of the PSP2. And also possibly,
1399160	1403800	you know, something that's also that little touch panel thing that's on the front of the
1403800	1408800	PSP phone. Perhaps this is where this patent comes from. They're saying that it uses a
1408800	1415240	two fingered touch gestures for data manipulation. And they specified the touch interface may
1415240	1420320	be separate from the main display. Very similar to what we saw with the PSP2. And they also
1420320	1427480	said that it's possible that they could have some sort of thing where in the first and
1427480	1434840	second case portions are slidable, connecting to each other. And where in the visual display
1434840	1442560	the touch pad disposed of the same side of the case. Or the hell that means. So, I don't
1442560	1448480	know. It's interesting, though, that they're putting out the... I mean, just based off
1448480	1452440	what we've seen, I guess it's not making... I would be willing to bet that this thing's
1452440	1455320	going to have a touch pad on the back for the PSP2. It's going to have a touch pad on
1455320	1460920	the front for, you know, the PSP phone or whatever. I mean, the stuff that we've heard
1460920	1464280	over and over again and seen pictures of, I don't think this is going to change all
1464280	1468600	of a sudden. So, yeah, that's probably what we're going to expect. And if it's coming...
1468600	1472160	If they're going to announce this at CES, you only have a few more weeks to wait anyways.
1472160	1478280	I mean, it's mid-January, so... I don't know. It's probably coming. You gotta know they're
1478280	1481640	pissed about this, though. They are pissed about this video. Oh, come on! Every single
1481640	1489840	secret that they've had just leaks out! Sony, man, I... They need to do something about
1489840	1495200	that. Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangehontrady.com. SSJ100Matt, responding to a comment I made
1495200	1499760	a minute ago, says, Why would I give my PSP a reach around? It never did anything for
1499760	1504560	me. Never made me a sandwich. That's a good question. AlphaKnanogram says, Eh, I don't
1504560	1509920	think this phone is the graphical powerhouse the developers are saying the PSP2 will be.
1509920	1514200	That's true. There was that chatter, I think, that we covered on the show a few weeks ago
1514200	1519220	from a developer saying, We've seen it and it's a huge graphical powerhouse. So... Which
1519220	1525080	might explain how they plan to compete with the 3DS by presenting better quality graphics,
1525080	1528500	perhaps, than what you're going to see in 3D? Because maybe the 3D thing will get old
1528500	1534360	real quick. Who knows? BlackWolf seems to think that the PSP2 will be at Game Developers
1534360	1539460	Conference. Might be the better place to debut it. Not a bad thought. Sony is no stranger
1539460	1544520	to making big announcements at Game Developers Conference. I believe the move was really
1544520	1550920	shown a lot clearer at this year's Game Developer Conference. And home was originally unveiled
1550920	1555600	at Game Developers Conference, right? Sounds right. Oh, by the way, totally left that out
1555600	1559480	of my gaming week. But on a listener's tip, I did try going into home this week and doing
1559480	1566160	the whole DDR room or whatever. I couldn't even get it to work. I gave up. I threw my
1566160	1572760	controller into fitter age. Let's see. And then some folks are saying that it was the
1572760	1580520	Panasonic Q. Or as Frisbee says, the Panasonic QQQ. And lastly, Tigerclaw says, the PSP phone
1580520	1587940	is just Sony trying to get into the iPhone and Android market for an app gaming perspective.
1587940	1592960	Maybe trying to expand the Sony App Store or whatever. Trying to get more PS1 game sales
1592960	1599040	and the cross-platform PSN games you can buy and movies. Because you know this thing will
1599040	1604280	do everything that the PlayStation Portable already does. Trying to expand the marketplace
1604280	1609480	potential perhaps? Good thoughts. All right, moving on to another story. We're gonna talk.
1609480	1613200	This is a little bit of a follow-up to something that had come up last week. Remember when
1613200	1618320	I mentioned that Harmonix is for sale? Well, sadly, I'm not reporting about a buyer tonight.
1618320	1623040	But I am saying somebody has said they are out of the picture. And you might be surprised.
1623040	1628000	It came from an interview with Bloomberg at Bloomberg.com. The CEO of Electronic Arts
1628000	1634060	John Riccitello actually has said that the company has no interest in pursuing more multimillion
1634060	1638160	dollar acquisitions for now. The company is gonna focus on better integrating some of
1638160	1642920	the casual game developers such as Playfish and some of the other casual gaming things.
1642920	1648340	I mentioned Pogo is a part of that too. Of course, the people asked, are you interested
1648340	1653840	in Harmonix? And Riccitello said, if we did that, it would, quote, look like I'm doubling
1653840	1658840	down on yesterday. I'm sure some smart investor will buy the business feeling they can catch
1658840	1663260	a falling knife. But more people have been cut trying to catch falling knives that have
1663260	1669320	benefited from getting the timing exactly right. Ouch. I mean, he did also say there
1669320	1673560	was some nice things about Harmonix and so forth. But he seems to think that the whole
1673560	1679840	thing is a falling knife. Like, I get that Rock Band 3 didn't sell as much as Rock Band
1679840	1688840	2, but I think the question that's not really being answered for me is that Harmonix made
1688840	1693520	this whole Rock Band phenomenon. They made the original Guitar Hero game, remember? They
1693520	1697080	were working with Activision back then and Red Octane and all that. They made the original
1697080	1703680	Guitar Hero. They split off to do Rock Band, ABC, and so on. Who's to say Harmonix is not
1703680	1708880	gonna make the next big thing? That just seems, I mean, I realize you're taking a little bit
1708880	1714840	of a gamble there, but if there's one thing, there's one thing I could say in the 9, 10
1714840	1719520	years practically we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio, the developers that take risks
1719520	1723760	are the ones that get the big payoffs. The ones that just sit there with their thumbs
1723760	1729760	up their rear making the same old crap year after year, Konami, don't usually get to have
1729760	1731040	the big payoffs.
1731040	1734960	Eh, Konami doesn't really do that anymore. Well, okay, with their dancing games.
1734960	1738360	As far as the music games go and the stuff this show started about, yes, they did for
1738360	1742720	a very long time. And, granted, they've got some other neat stuff coming out now and they
1742720	1747900	still have Metal Gear, whatever, but as far as the music game goes, that's how I feel.
1747900	1756900	To quote the 62nd Ferengi Rule of Acquisition, the riskier the road, the greater the profit.
1756900	1758600	Hmm.
1758600	1766600	So, maybe they should be putting the masters of business forward.
1766600	1772280	Now, BlackWolf in our chat room is saying that the falling knife thing is actually a
1772280	1777680	misquote and the whole thing is not quite, I'm trying to look at what part of the story
1777680	1782240	this is in here, he just linked us to something here. I guess he actually came out and said,
1782240	1786440	I think the music genre is going to recover. I don't know exactly how. It could be based
1786440	1791480	on some new innovation. Maybe it all becomes dance-based. Well, because we've never seen
1791480	1795720	the dance thing before. Although, you know, granted there's Dance Central.
1795720	1801040	He says he likes harmonics and he said, when asked about it yesterday, what I said was
1801040	1805800	Alex, the co-founder of the studio, is a great developer. Harmonics is one of the great developers
1805800	1809920	of all time. They've got the leading dance product and maybe the leading game full stop
1809920	1814880	on Kinect and the question was what investors might be thinking about it. The nervous investor
1814880	1818760	would be worried about the decline of the music sector feeling like a falling knife.
1818760	1822660	The only part of that conversation that got reported was the falling knife part. So, he's
1822660	1828480	saying, I was misquoted. Although, I guess they did use a part that he gave them, but
1828480	1833360	whatever. He didn't mean to come off as harsh as he did. So, okay, at least I like the fact
1833360	1837680	that he acknowledges that, you know, harmonics could be also sitting on this big thing here
1837680	1842920	with Dance Central and I think that's true. So, I don't frown as much as I did, but it
1842920	1848240	doesn't change the fact that they aren't interested in acquiring harmonics at this time. And even
1848240	1851820	though maybe falling knife might have been harsh, it seems to be that the motivation
1851820	1858360	behind that is they don't have that next big thing just right yet, I guess. Although, it
1858360	1862840	is a little weird because he says Dance Central seems to be a big deal, but I don't want it.
1862840	1864560	Okay, fair enough.
1864560	1866560	Fair enough.
1866560	1868560	Let's move on, Dark Sakura.
1868560	1876800	Well, for the Doctor Who fans like myself, there will be the last episode for the Doctor
1876800	1882660	Who the adventure games called Shadows of the Vashta Narada, which, for anyone who doesn't
1882660	1887840	remember that one, this was the episode where they were stuck in the library and these things
1887840	1892720	were eating the people and it was the first episode that River Song showed up in. Aww.
1892720	1898760	But that's your little reminder of who the Vashta Narada were. But it's going to be taking
1898760	1905360	place during Christmas and will be underwater and you can download it on Christmas Day in
1905360	1910120	the UK. Well, it's free there. Here, you have to pay five bucks or you can get the whole
1910120	1912120	season for thirteen.
1912120	1915120	Hmm. Where can you buy it here in the US?
1915120	1917120	I would assume the BBC website.
1917120	1923720	The BBC. This is all paid through the tax money they pay over there for TV, right? That's
1923720	1926120	how come they don't have to pay anything?
1926120	1930920	Yeah. And basically, you have to actually pay a television tax, depending, I think,
1930920	1936680	on your channels. But if you don't pay the taxes, people will come around and go,
1936680	1938680	okay, you have to pay us and blah, blah, blah.
1938680	1947080	Hmm. Interesting. The underwater Christmas adventure for Doctor Who. What I think is
1947080	1951600	interesting about this, because the BBC is kind of paying for these games, right? They're
1951600	1956240	paying for the development, right? So it's kind of like, you know, it's a very different
1956240	1959800	– and you have to pardon my ignorance here a little bit, but I've never lived in another
1959800	1966560	country. All I know is it's very different setup here in America than it is in Britain,
1966560	1972400	where it's a lot more, I guess you could say, to me, it seems like the BBC is sort
1972400	1978880	of like their PBS. But over here in America, we think of PBS as the network that plays
1978880	1983520	classic opera shows and Sesame Street and occasionally video games like that.
1983520	1986800	I don't think the BBC is.
1986800	1991560	But what I'm saying, over there, they're actually making this more cutting edge programming.
1991560	1995480	It's like, imagine if PBS was making the shows Fox was making. That's kind of what
1995480	1999400	it is. Like it's, I don't know. That's how it strikes me. But my point is, it's
1999400	2005360	interesting that now we have this whole gaming thing coming out of that, that is part of
2005360	2011160	the public broadcasting. Yet here, we don't have anything like that. PBS doesn't really
2011160	2014840	make games. And I think there's been stories on the show before about how there's kind
2014840	2018720	of been a call for that. Like why do we have the public broadcasting system, but yet we
2018720	2023920	don't have anything for making games outside of, I don't know, maybe like America's
2023920	2027920	Army, although that's still the government contracting with somebody else to make that
2027920	2030640	for recruitment purposes. That's the closest thing I can think of.
2030640	2040640	Well, just to let you know, the Doctor Who games are actually up on direct2drive.com.
2040640	2044000	You can just search for them there. But I'm going to put a link to the downloads in the
2044000	2047560	chat room. I like the point that Tiger Claw is making
2047560	2052400	in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com. Let's not forget PBS also plays British
2052400	2055440	shows. The first time I heard Doctor Who was PBS.
2055440	2061160	Well, that was my introduction to Doctor Who. And when I was little, and I like Star Trek
2061160	2064360	now, don't get me wrong. But when I was little, I didn't like Star Trek at all. I
2064360	2068760	was watching Doctor Who, which I thought was a lot cooler and a lot neater because the
2068760	2072120	concept was neat and it was this crazy old man and all these people running around with
2072120	2077560	him. And my first doctor was the fourth doctor with Sarah Jane. And she's, to this day,
2077560	2081060	my favorite companion. She's back in the series. She has her own series and it makes
2081060	2088920	me happy. But Doctor Who is just awesome. Um, Maji-Nami, Maji-Nami-Khan.
2088920	2096000	Say Maji-Nami-Khan. Whatever. Maji-Nami-Khan in our chat. I thought that's what I said
2096000	2101200	before, and I got yelled at for mispronouncing it. Whatever. Says, uh, and yet some political
2101200	2107160	extremists want to shut down all public broadcasts, radio, TV, et cetera, if I recall correctly.
2107160	2115160	Yeah, I've heard that too. And, um, I don't know. That, I, I, the thought, the thought
2115160	2120960	makes me sad because I, when I think of PBS, I think of Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers Neighborhood
2120960	2126280	and Bob Ross and shows like that, that wouldn't exist without PBS. And it just makes me very
2126280	2130180	sad. I mean, granted, maybe I haven't yet developed an appreciation for some of the
2130180	2134560	other stuff they show, like not in the morning or not for children, but I don't know. It
2134560	2139160	just would be very sad if that were to go away. You know what else PBS gave us? Faulty
2139160	2147720	Towers for our British television. Red Dwarf. I love Red Dwarf. You know, I watched Keeping
2147720	2153320	Up Appearances and Are You Being Served and Monty Python's Flying Circus. We need, we
2153320	2159280	need more of, of, of this on the PBS, but now we have BBC America, I guess. Uh, Gamer
2159280	2163880	Girl in our chat room says, wait, I'm lost. Why do they want to shut down PBS? Uh, without
2163880	2169160	getting too political on the show. Um, I, I think it just boils down to that whole,
2169160	2174160	you're poisoning the public minds with these crazy liberal ideas that PBS gives or whatever,
2174160	2178600	which is a little bit ludicrous to me. But I think, I think as Dark Soccer referenced,
2178600	2185340	a lot of it comes back to NPR. And when some people don't like what a public organization
2185340	2192120	is saying, they want to shut it down, I guess is the best way I can cut it. But there's
2192120	2196760	a lot of reading between the lines that goes with that stuff too. NPR gets a lot of its
2196760	2207320	funding too from the Democratic Party and PBS gets funding from political sources. But
2207320	2211120	I think that, you know, if people want to pay for it, let them pay for it. It's not
2211120	2216000	your problem. Just don't listen to it. But it's people too busy being right and wanting
2216000	2220800	others to think just like they do. That's the bottom line.
2220800	2226920	All right. But I'm not going to go any further than that. I'm just saying people being too
2226920	2230200	busy being right and wanting other people to think the way they do.
2230200	2235120	All right. Well, let's, let's talk about something we can all appreciate and that is sales, right
2235120	2238760	Logie? Oh yes. Of course, Black Friday always means
2238760	2245400	lots of big sales. And with that, you know, the game companies have to come out and start
2245400	2252800	waving their cock around, I guess. Connect, of course, sold very well. And they've reached
2252800	2259040	2.5 million units with the help of Black Friday. And that's worldwide, of course. And of course
2259040	2263960	that, you know, they break it down. That's a hundred thousand units a day. And that they're
2263960	2273000	on track to meet their original goal of 5 million units sold this holiday. So that's
2273000	2278840	pretty awesome, I guess. And I think they've already bypassed the move sales from what
2278840	2287060	I remember as well. Of course, Nintendo, they're saying that they sold a lot of DS's and Wii's
2287060	2292480	during Black Friday. It might help that they also had a lot of new colors for different
2292480	2298200	stuff coming out, new DSi XL colors. I still don't understand why people go crazy about
2298200	2306880	the colors, but whatever. They had the 25th anniversary red systems, you know, with, what
2306880	2312180	was it, Mario Kart in there. They also had, you know, the red Wii's, which people are
2312180	2319080	going crazy over for no apparent reason. And, you know, the orange and green systems with
2319080	2324760	different games with that. Anyways, they sold 900,000 DS units. And that's, you know, DS,
2324760	2334360	DS Lite, DS Lite XL. Or DSi's, I guess. And then of course 600,000 Wii's were sold. And
2334360	2341960	that's during the week of November 21st through the 27th. That's really interesting about,
2341960	2345640	especially the number of Kinect sales. I mean, I'm hearing more people in the kind of the
2345640	2352720	mass media, quote unquote, saying that this is, you know, the Wii of this year or this
2352720	2356040	is one of the must have toys of the year. But it's kind of interesting because I think
2356040	2360560	when we sat back and saw that, you remember a couple weeks ago, like two or three weeks
2360560	2364360	ago, Microsoft came out and said we have a goal of selling 5 million units. And we were
2364360	2369360	like, oh, that's cute. But seeing as you kind of botched your 360 launch by not having the
2369360	2372900	units available, we kind of, and Nintendo did the same thing, we kind of think you're
2372900	2376600	gonna do the same thing with Kinect and won't meet that goal. But it looks like the supply
2376600	2381360	is actually meeting the demand a little bit. In certain markets, of course. Uh huh. How
2381360	2387240	so? Well, because, you know, the smaller guys obviously aren't getting enough, I'm sure
2387240	2392360	as hell know we aren't getting enough shipments of that shit. They're sending them all the
2392360	2401080	retail, those fuckers. So yeah. Well, they obviously are shipping them somewhere because
2401080	2407400	they're selling those units, so. I don't know. They're still going for a pretty penny though
2407400	2413920	on eBay, that's for sure. Alright. Really? How much, what's the reseller market look
2413920	2417360	like on that? Because I remember with some of those things, oh my gosh. It's usually
2417360	2423420	50 to 100 dollars of retail. And they're going pretty good. Wow. Alright, well let's get
2423420	2430120	into a big story from this week. I don't know. And Loki asked me before the show, why are
2430120	2434320	we reporting on this? And I don't know, but I think the response to this is kind of funny.
2434320	2438480	So let me tell you what's going on. PETA decided to parody another game this week. You know,
2438480	2441640	they've done some video game parodies. They had like, I think there was like a Super Mario
2441640	2446380	Brothers parody and some of the crap too. But Super Meat Boy was the last game they
2446380	2452040	set their eyes on and they decided to make this parody called Super Tofu Boy. And Super
2452040	2458220	Tofu Boy is, you know, you play a chunk of tofu instead of a chunk of meat. They've made
2458220	2464140	Super Meat Boy the enemy in the game. Quote, Meat Boy is a vengeful, bloody cube of rotting
2464140	2470200	animal flesh and he smells. After a short-lived fling with Bandage Girl, he became enraged
2470200	2474920	when he was dumped for the tasty and satisfying Tofu Boy, etcetera, etcetera. That's the blabber
2474920	2480480	setup from the PETA game website. And the gameplay is, it's fairly similar to Super
2480480	2486000	Meat Boy, but it's, you know, obviously a cheap hack. Well, actually I shouldn't say
2486000	2491400	a cheap hack. It's, considering how fast this must have turned around, it's a pretty decent
2491400	2495480	hack, dare I say it. But whoever they've got programming the games at PETA seems to be
2495480	2502200	pretty talented like it or not. Anyway, the point is, Super Meat Boy came out and responded
2502200	2509360	to the whole Super Tofu Boy thing and with this tweet that's really, ouch, they made
2509360	2515200	a tweet. How many PETA members does it take to change a light bulb? None. PETA can't change
2515200	2519640	anything. But I'm bummed. That was pretty much their response to the whole thing. Not
2519640	2523600	quite just that though. If you read some of the other follow-up tweets and so on, apparently
2523600	2529260	the guy who made Super Meat Boy went on to the PETA forums and posted under some different
2529260	2533960	names to try to call attention to the game to, I guess, basically get free promotion
2533960	2539920	and it worked. That's the crazy part. I don't know if he's making that up in retrospect,
2539920	2544200	but I don't see why not. I think that's actually kind of a smart thing to do. Like, oh my God,
2544200	2548880	can you believe they're making this game out of a moving piece of meat and glamorizing
2548880	2555000	meat and meat is murder. So, I think that's kind of funny. Tasty, tasty murder. I think
2555000	2561320	it's really funny that it worked in so many ways. So anyway, now they've come out and
2561320	2567000	said, well, since we were able to get basically free advertisement for Super Meat Boy, we're
2567000	2572720	going to put Super Tofu Boy as an unlockable character in the PC version of the game. So
2572720	2581200	they came out and tweeted, if you type PETA file, P-E-T-A-P-H-I-L-E, at the character
2581200	2586520	select screen, you will be able to play as Super Tofu Boy. Wow, and I even made that
2586520	2591600	joke earlier. I had no idea. PETA file. Imagine on the con says in here, the funny thing is
2591600	2595640	that by Super Meat Boy creators' own admission, Meat Boy is a normal person without skin,
2595640	2602640	not a hunk of meat. Way to screw up, PETA. It's just a game for heaven's sake. And again,
2602640	2608200	I love Super Meat Boy. It's a great arcade game. I really think it's only drawback is
2608200	2614280	this whole like, what? It's a piece of meat? Like I don't, that's your mark. What? That's
2614280	2618960	the artwork? Really? That's the name of your game, Super Meat Boy? But whatever, I didn't
2618960	2623360	make it. People probably say the same thing about Orange Lounge Radio. Why the hell do
2623360	2626720	you call your video game show Orange Lounge Radio? You're not about oranges. You're not
2626720	2631400	about Orange County. Frisbee makes a very good point and this is very true. PETA, we
2631400	2635880	euthanize more animals than we take in even though we don't support euthanization. It's
2635880	2639640	true. I mean, they actually have to report all of this stuff to the IRS. It's a matter
2639640	2645120	of public record. By the way, Edmund McMillan, who is the co-creator of the game, he admitted
2645120	2650160	that he made fake usernames in PETA's forum pushing the game at them in hopes that something
2650160	2655120	would happen. PETA is 1000 times more well known than Super Meat Boy and the fact that
2655120	2658760	they went out of their way to make a parody like this is beyond flattery and amazingly
2658760	2664080	helpful. Edmund McMillan has said he was once a vegetarian and has worked as an animal control
2664080	2670560	officer and he disagrees with PETA's total stance against the lab testing of animals
2670560	2675800	and this is so interesting. He's saying that being against the lab testing of animals means
2675800	2680680	you're against these medical discoveries and treatments that save lives like his mom who
2680680	2686400	is diabetic and that's why he's against PETA. The person right under the PETA lady, Ingrid
2686400	2695240	Newkirk, is a diabetic who is on insulin made from dog testing. Interesting. I know, right?
2695240	2700880	Fun double standard, right? Anyway, why is it that this show keeps coming back to politics
2700880	2704880	tonight? I don't know, but I just found it very interesting that an author of a game
2704880	2710900	trolled the PETA forums and got his way. That's outstanding to me. I just hope it's not one
2710900	2715900	of those hindsight is 20-20 things. PETA is a cult! Alright, let's move on to another
2715900	2719160	video game story and then we're going to get into a whole other cult, the Techno Kitten
2719160	2725720	Adventure cult. I'm very excited to get there. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Well,
2725720	2734560	you know that pretty pretty pretty song that we've been listening to for Civ 4? I should
2734560	2737320	try to sing it because it's much prettier than I'm giving it credit for. I could play
2737320	2747240	a little clip. Not right now. It's been nominated for a Grammy. It's under best instrumental
2747240	2752460	arrangement accompanying vocalist category from the composer's debut album, Calling
2752460	2760580	All Dawns. It's a really pretty song, I mean, it's been going around since they've included
2760580	2768000	it with the video games live. It's gorgeous, I really think it is, so I hope that they
2768000	2784080	win. Here's a little clip. It's kind of quiet, sorry guys. Civ 4 really did have this epic
2784080	2789200	theme song to it, which obviously is this, and then Civ 5 just pales in comparison. I
2789200	2792440	mean, Civ 5 is a great game, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't really have quite the
2792440	2798320	moving song that Civ 4 did, so I'm happy to see that a video game song gets acknowledged
2798320	2803760	with a Grammy nomination, but here's the weird thing to me. Civ 4 didn't come out this year,
2803760	2809280	so it is not getting nominated because it's from Civ 4. It's getting nominated because
2809280	2812700	Christopher Tin ended up making an album that happened to come out in the past year that
2812700	2817320	has this song on it. So you wonder, well, did it get nominated because people knew the
2817320	2821920	song already? But Civ 4 is, what, a four or five year old game. It wasn't nominated for
2821920	2826480	a Grammy four or five years ago. 2005, was it? Yeah. So it's kind of interesting that
2826480	2830400	it took this long, and you've got to wonder that, oh, well, maybe people knew about it
2830400	2836160	from here? Who knows. Black Wolf in our chat room wants to point out that Christopher Tin,
2836160	2843080	the album, was also nominated. So no matter how people found it, and if you actually listen
2843080	2847800	to the rest of the album itself, it is a really good album. You know, it's not pop or rock,
2847800	2853320	it's very different. It's a world kind of more, I don't want to say Enya, but more of
2853320	2860640	that, it's PBS music, actually. And that's not a bad thing. So also I like Akuma JP in
2860640	2863680	our chat room says Lion King. It does kind of sound like the theme of the Lion King,
2863680	2867640	does it a little bit? A little less Elton John, though? It sounds like the freaking
2867640	2872360	Avatar soundtrack. Does it? I've never really listened to the Avatar soundtrack. Is it that
2872360	2877640	good? I like it. I thought it had really pretty music in it, but it's the same type of, the
2877640	2882880	same theme. All right, well, I promised you guys that we were going to have an interview
2882880	2890040	tonight. So we are going to give Nick a call. He is the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure.
2890040	2894320	And I'm really excited to talk to him about the game and how he got on the, how we got
2894320	2897840	him on the show and everything. So we're calling him right now. This is totally live and unscripted.
2897840	2903640	Anything could happen, guys. If you have questions, post them in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
2903640	2907880	While we wait for him to pick up. Wouldn't it be funny if this went to voicemail? Like,
2907880	2914320	oops, I forgot. Hello? Hi, is this Nick? Yep. Hi, this is Rob with Orange Lounge Radio.
2914320	2918920	How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? Good. You are on the air on our lovely show
2918920	2923080	here that we do every Sunday night. And I want to talk to you a little bit about Techno
2923080	2929460	Kitten Adventure, your game for the Xbox 360. So I don't know if you know, but we had a
2929460	2934560	listener tweet us about this last week. We had no idea that the game was out there. But
2934560	2939920	our show was kind of founded on the games like Dance Dance Revolution and BeatMania
2939920	2945280	2DX. So we're definitely no stranger to happy hardcore. And of course we love kittens. Who
2945280	2951720	doesn't? So this game kind of seemed to be almost the perfect game in a way. So we have
2951720	2959240	to know, what inspired Techno Kitten Adventure, Nick? Well, I recently discovered happy hardcore,
2959240	2967480	which is the greatest genre of all time. And I played Robot Unicorn Attack a while ago.
2967480	2972800	And that kind of gave the idea to incorporate music into a game. But Robot Unicorn Attack
2972800	2977920	didn't really have everything going to the music. It was more like a background sort
2977920	2985800	of thing. And also, I like kittens, as you said. Who doesn't? So I wanted to incorporate
2985800	2990000	all three things into one. And that's what I came up with. Is this the first game you've
2990000	2993800	ever made? Or do you have other XNA games out there? Or was this like your first adventure?
2993800	2999120	I have a few more games out there. Some of them are not very good. One of the better
2999120	3006640	ones is Physics Sandbox 2. It's kind of like Crayon Physics Deluxe. I don't know if you
3006640	3011160	played that. I have. It was on Steam. Well, I'm sure it's still there. But yes, I have
3011160	3016080	played that. Very cool. Yeah, it's a lot like that. It's for Xbox. You've done other games.
3016080	3021680	How long did this game take you to make Techno Kitten Adventure? Um, a summer. I didn't really
3021680	3026480	spend too much time on it, though. Most of the time when it's actually licensing the
3026480	3030560	music. Okay, that was the next thing I had to ask you about. Because you didn't make
3030560	3036200	or write a song specifically for this game. You somehow licensed an existing song that's
3036200	3041280	out there, right? Tell me how you got the song and found the song and got the song in
3041280	3048000	the game, ultimately. Well, I'd heard the song before, like a trans version. And then
3048000	3054120	I discovered the Happy Hardcore version, which is from a company in the UK. Pretty popular
3054120	3061120	over there, but non-existent in the US. So I just contacted them and paid a fee and got
3061120	3066000	to use it for the game. Nice. And that song, of course, is Frisco with Sea of Love is the
3066000	3071200	song. Now, I don't know if you're allowed to tell us, so you can pass on this question
3071200	3080680	if you want, but do they get a cut of the profits because you used the song? That's
3080680	3087280	alright. What are the possibilities? Let me back up a little bit. How successful has this
3087280	3091760	game been for you? I know you're only charging a dollar for it, but I also noticed it was
3091760	3096520	in the top 50 indie games, which has got to be a hard place to get to. So has this game
3096520	3101480	been pretty successful for you, money-wise? It's actually been less successful than my
3101480	3107120	other games. Really? For an offer. But I think they were a lot more appropriate for the audience
3107120	3115640	that goes to indie games, which seems to be like 13-year-olds. Hey, wait a minute! Wait
3115640	3121840	a minute! Alright, so it hasn't been as successful to share the games. That's really interesting,
3121840	3125640	but definitely there's been an audience for it. I mean, do you plan to do anything else
3125640	3133840	with this idea? We are going to port it to Windows Phone 7, iPhone, and Android probably
3133840	3140760	within the next three months. You said we. Is there a whole team behind it? Well, I'm
3140760	3145960	working with another company right now. We're going to redo the art, most of it. Probably
3145960	3152240	add some new effects. I see. So did somebody find your game there and was like, we want
3152240	3156480	to work with you on this a little bit? I'm guessing it's got something. Yeah. Okay. I'll
3156480	3162840	get it on my phone. I was going to say, not bad for a bunch of 13-year-olds. One of them
3162840	3167320	has got their own company somewhere that's going to help you out. What about, you know
3167320	3171920	I've got to ask about a potential sequel to Techno Kitten Adventure? Is there a Techno
3171920	3176240	Kitten Adventure 2 in the works? Electric Booboo? I don't know. The company that contacted
3176240	3181240	me said that, depending on how well it does, they'll probably think about making a sequel.
3181240	3185440	I don't know if it'll be the same genre of music. For me, I'd like it to be some more
3185440	3190080	happy hardcore, but we'll see. It'll probably be a different genre. Well, this could be
3190080	3194800	like the whole new Dance Dance Revolution where you can have a whole soundtrack of music
3194800	3198600	to pick from for the different levels. But I imagine it's got to be kind of a pain to
3198600	3202760	sync up all those songs. You know, part of the charm that people are noticing of the
3202760	3207680	game is the way that the background kind of syncs to the song. Where did you kind of get
3207680	3212880	the idea to do that? Some of the syncing that you do in the game? Well, I started off just
3212880	3217200	wanting to make the Helicopter Clone and then having hardcore playing in the background
3217200	3222840	kind of make it like robot unicorn attack. And then while I was doing that, I made a
3222840	3227200	few effects on accident that worked really well with the music. So I decided to have
3227200	3236360	everything sync up with it, which took listening to the song a few hundred times, unfortunately.
3236360	3241120	But you love happy hardcore, so it's okay, right? Yeah, it's actually still a good song.
3241120	3246400	It is one of those rare songs that kind of works for a game like this. And I think part
3246400	3249800	of what made robot unicorn attack is that that erasure song kind of worked really well
3249800	3254240	for that game. But then they tried to do, there was like a robot unicorn attack metal
3254240	3257280	version or something, wasn't there, Loki? Yeah. You were talking about? And it wasn't
3257280	3261640	as good. It wasn't nearly as good. I liked it, but then the Christmas one, that's just
3261640	3266520	jumping the shark right there. So you gotta be careful, Nick, not to jump the shark. So
3266520	3271360	enjoy this. I played the metal version. It sucked pretty bad. Thank you. Unless you do
3271360	3278280	a techno shark. Techno sharks with lasers adventures. Alright, I got a couple more questions
3278280	3282880	for you. And that is, are you thinking though, you know, I know you got the company that
3282880	3286720	wants to do other things with this title and so forth. Do you think maybe you're going
3286720	3290360	to do another game that really has nothing to do with this whatsoever? Like this is just
3290360	3294280	kind of a one off thing and you have other games you want to do or do you want to kind
3294280	3298560	of play this out and see where it goes? Right now I'm working on a music based shoot-em-up,
3298560	3305000	which is going to be way more gameplay based rather than a simple one button game. Ah,
3305000	3308360	very cool. Do you want to, anything else you can say about that right now or is it all
3308360	3314400	still in the works? Um, it's pretty much going to be a music visualizer going in the background
3314400	3318920	and then just really hardcore shoot-em-up, crap load of bullets, bullet hole sort of
3318920	3323120	thing. Awesome. That sounds like it could be pretty awesome. We do have a lot of cave
3323120	3326480	shooter fans. That's true. I had to listen to this show. We have a lot of music game
3326480	3329400	fans. We have a lot of cave shooter fans. So I think there's going to be definitely
3329400	3333060	an audience. This is a very small audience, trust me, but there's an audience out there
3333060	3338720	for it. So, best of luck with all of that. One other question I want to ask you about
3338720	3342280	and that is about their reaction, you know, to something like this. Because when something
3342280	3347400	like this goes viral, quote unquote, you read a lot of interesting things on the internet
3347400	3352120	about the game. Do you ever Google Technokit and adventure to kind of see what comes up
3352120	3355400	or see what people are saying on the internet about your game? Or are you one of those people
3355400	3362400	that's like, I don't care? I look at it quite a bit actually. Yeah, what do you think? Um,
3362400	3367920	a lot of people like it and then others just haters gonna hate. Absolutely right. Oh my
3367920	3372800	god, that's my slogan I've said on the show before. Haters gonna hate. Absolutely. I agree.
3372800	3375640	Haters gonna hate. What's the worst thing you've read about Technokit and adventure?
3375640	3379820	Because I want to know, who can hate on a cat? Who can hate on a flying cat? What's
3379820	3384960	the worst thing you've read about Technokit and adventure? Um, most of them just say that
3384960	3390700	it looks like it was made in MS Paint. I haven't really read anything that horrified me. Haters
3390700	3395460	to the left. Haters to the left. You know what? I kind of think the art style in a way
3395460	3401280	is kind of part of the charm. Like, if it had been all like 3D, HD, Uber effects, I
3401280	3409160	don't think it would really be the same thing. That makes sense? So, I say, you go. And good
3409160	3413960	luck with all those future projects. Anything else you want to plug here on our little show?
3413960	3417760	Of upcoming projects or what have you? No thanks. Alright. Well the game, you have a
3417760	3422200	website or anything official website for? Not at the moment. There should be a website
3422200	3426440	in the works though. Alright. Well then, we'll let you guys know about it when Nick tells
3426440	3431320	us about it. The game is Technokit and Adventure and it is available at Technokit and Adventures
3431320	3437400	excuse me. And it's available right now on the Xbox Live Indie Games. It's one whole
3437400	3444080	dollar. Which is really not a bad price at all. It's the cost of a taco. As I said earlier
3444080	3450080	in the show, well technically on Sundays it's the cost of three tacos. A taco is for a moment
3450080	3455760	but Technokittens are forever. That's right. And as I was saying earlier in the show, I
3455760	3459640	also played Poker Night at the inventory this week which was five dollars. And I played
3459640	3464920	more Technokitten Adventure. So I think it was the better deal. So there you go. Alright.
3464920	3467560	Well Nick, thank you so much for being on our show. Really appreciate it. And best of
3467560	3471520	luck with your future projects. Thanks for having me. But don't make a metal version.
3471520	3478560	I will. Alright, thank you. Have a good night. Bye. I love it. From tweet to call on the
3478560	3483920	show, Technokitten Adventure. Nick from Technokitten Adventure. He didn't tell me his last name
3483920	3488440	but we'll give him a little bit of anonymity. It's not real ID here on the show after all.
3488440	3492720	Thanks to Nick for being such a good sport. And the Zominar chatroom says if you have
3492720	3498760	two dollars, you can have Technokittens and a taco. I don't know. In this economy, in
3498760	3508640	this economy, it might be tough. And that's value! Alright. Anyhow, let's move on to more
3508640	3511640	stories. Actually release dates. It's time for it to get to the show. So if you don't
3511640	3514920	want to get Technokitten Adventure or you've already bought it and you want to look at
3514920	3518840	other games, there's other stuff coming to a store near you, right, Loki? Yes, and this
3518840	3523200	will probably be the last week that stuff will be coming to a store near you, at least
3523200	3530080	this year, because it is dying down to zero. I mean, literally I think the week after next,
3530080	3536360	there's one game. And the week after that, possibly another game. And that's it. But
3536360	3541520	yeah, next week though, to kind of coincide with it, it's a little bit early, with the
3541520	3548320	launch of the new Tron movie, Tron Evolution. It's going to be kind of a prequel to Tron
3548320	3555320	Legacy, and that'll be coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360. Fuck yeah. And then they're going
3555320	3565160	to be doing kind of an arena-based sort of combat game. It's Tron Legacy Battle Grid,
3565160	3570200	and that's coming out on the Wii. Oh, and I guess it's also on PC as well. So definitely
3570200	3575560	check that out, that looks pretty exciting. Oh, and then the Tron Battle Grid, I believe
3575560	3584440	is also on DS, and possibly PSP. SBKX Superbike World Championship on Playstation 3, and I
3584440	3590720	believe Xbox 360 as well. And that's going to be kind of a street bike racing game. Yogi
3590720	3598440	Bear, the video game. And that's... Right? I hope that movie tanks. But sadly there's
3598440	3602840	kids that are going to want to see it. You know, kind of a bit of a side note here. I
3602840	3607760	actually got an invite, and I can't go to it. Well, let me put it this way, I'm not
3607760	3615240	going to it. For a Nielsen screening of a summer movie that's coming out next year,
3615240	3619360	and it's a computer-animated comedy. You know what happens to be sitting in the middle of
3619360	3627600	summer as a computer-animated comedy? Smurfs the movie. Oh no. Fuck no. Oh, so they don't
3627600	3631180	tell you what the movie is? They don't tell me what the movie is. Oh, but you should go
3631180	3636960	see it just to poop on it. No, because Nellie's like, if you leave me with the baby all night
3636960	3644840	long to go see Smurfs the movie, I'm going to kill you. That's fair. That is fair. Honestly,
3644840	3651040	I'm not going to risk the fact that it possibly might be Smurfs the movie, so I'm not going.
3651040	3656120	Sniper Elite coming out on the Wii, looks like a pretty generic sniper game. Which might
3656120	3661240	work a lot better combined with the Smurfs movie and Yogi Bear. You know that they will
3661240	3667200	be making a Smurfs game, I will have you know. Okay, not to get too tangenty, but I've had
3667200	3673840	not one, but several friends tell me that the Smurf village game on the phone, iPhone,
3673840	3681060	which is by Capcom, is actually really good for the whole like Wii rule, Farmville-y,
3681060	3684800	you know, Facebook-y type of game on your phone. No, I'm not touching that game. I saw
3684800	3688480	it and I was like, you know, I could download it for free and check it out and see if it's
3688480	3692520	any good. No, I'm not even going to check it out to see if it's any good. I'm sorry.
3692520	3697200	The only Smurfs game I've played and will only play is the one on the ColecoVision.
3697200	3701360	Yeah, absolutely. That's the one where you can get her naked. Smurfette naked. There's
3701360	3706960	a bug. You go backwards or something instead of going forwards at the very end and there's
3706960	3712280	a bug where Smurfette gets naked. I have this game. Really? I have a ColecoVision in the
3712280	3717040	game. I played Smurfs, like, cause I used to, when I was like four or five years old,
3717040	3720520	I was a huge fan of the Smurfs. I have to tell you this, I have to tell you this. Becky
3720520	3726100	just told me, Julian and I saw the preview for Yogi Bear and he said it looked stupid
3726100	3731400	and he's three and a half. I think Julian should be the official movie critic of Orange
3731400	3735640	Ons Radio. What do you think? I agree. He's the official child of Orange Ons Radio. During
3735640	3743760	Tron, they're going to have the new Transformers 3 trailers. Okay, this other game coming out,
3743760	3747760	the Touchmaster. Wait, wait, hold on, sorry. This is really important though, okay? It
3747760	3751800	was on the Atari 2600 and the ColecoVision. The ColecoVision version of Smurf, Rescue
3751800	3756000	and Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg or programming error. Upon reaching Smurfette's
3756000	3760960	screen, the player can return to the previous screen. Just before the screen changes, it
3760960	3765680	will appear as though the top of Smurfette's dress comes off, making her appear topless.
3765680	3769800	Two of the background music tracks are simple, you know, whatever, who cares about the music.
3769800	3774160	So yes, Smurfette gets topless if you go backwards. If you leave her ass, she'll show her titties
3774160	3781080	to get you to come back. Awesome. Sorry, Loki. It was worth reporting. Yeah, it was worth
3781080	3786080	reporting. You know when she made She Was Evil? Touchmaster Connect, it's all those
3786080	3791980	wonderful bar games that they have. What makes it unique compared to some of the other ones,
3791980	3796960	you can share your scores via Twitter and Facebook using this DS title. So, that's kind
3796960	3804360	of neat I guess. Yu-Gi-Oh! 50's Dual Transer coming out on the Wii. And how can we not
3804360	3810080	forget World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the new expansion coming out on PC. Hey, what did
3810080	3818520	Nick say, DarkSagra? Haters gonna hate. No barfing over there. Also, let's see. Bejeweled
3818520	3828520	3 on PC. That's pretty awesome. New You Fitness First Yoga and Pilates on the Wii. And then,
3828520	3832560	sorry, I must have had something on my throat there. And then finally, a week from today,
3832560	3837280	Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition for the Wii. It's just a Super Nintendo game!
3837280	3841720	Seriously, are you gonna pay Nintendo? They did nothing to the game other than make it
3841720	3852880	work with the controls. And you're gonna pay them $30? Alright. If that's what you really
3852880	3857200	want. But it comes in a shiny box. You know what kind of a message you're sending to Nintendo.
3857200	3863240	You can buy anything that you sell. And then it's gonna be remade in 3D and be $35 on the
3863240	3868680	3DS. Wait. Wait for it. There's better ROM hacks out there. I mean, what was it? New
3868680	3873840	Super Mario Bros. 3. Remember that? The whole, they completely re-edited the levels for the
3873840	3878600	DS version to Super Mario Bros. 3 and bonus levels and added all these challenge maps
3878600	3882620	and stuff? See, that's a value right there. They put that on a cartridge, I'd buy that
3882620	3888600	shit in no time, but I'm sorry. They did nothing. They didn't even try to make it new. By the
3888600	3892680	way, since you flew by Bejeweled 3, which I think will actually be a big seller because
3892680	3897640	those PopCap games do very well. Zuma Blitz is a game I actually played this week because
3897640	3900920	they have the whole beta thing or whatever. It's not very hard to get into. On Facebook,
3900920	3907400	it's a Facebook game. It's Zuma in a Minute. It's actually pretty good. It's pretty addicting.
3907400	3913120	And you know, it's free. They have their whole like, you can buy things to unlock more special
3913120	3916540	blah blah blahs. But as far as the whole like competing with your friends for high scores
3916540	3921440	and so on, you know, it's cool. It's just like the Bejeweled one. Or here's something
3921440	3926360	even better. And yes, I know that the stuff is already available on, you know, the Virtual
3926360	3930800	Console and stuff like that. Why? I mean, they've got a whole damn disc. I can tell
3930800	3935160	you right now that this image of this disc is probably going to be like a few megs. And
3935160	3939880	that's it. And the rest is just all blank space or filler or whatever. I mean, why didn't
3939880	3947160	they put like Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2 on there? Maybe Mario 64. You know,
3947160	3951480	make it worthwhile. And hell, you could even charge, you know, 50 bucks for it at that
3951480	3958440	point. Because it's, you know, full of all the Mario games. But no, there's Mario All-Stars.
3958440	3963960	Maybe there's an unlockable. No, there's not an unlockable. Yeah, there'll be an unlockable
3963960	3969760	alright and guess what it'll be? Demos. Virtual Console demos. Hey, you like these games?
3969760	3975080	You can give them their original form on the Virtual Console. Anything else for this week,
3975080	3979360	Doki? Ah, that's it. Alright, let's go to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates.
3979360	3984000	On the Xbox 360, Japan gets their version of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood this week.
3984000	3989880	Also, Kinect Animals in a regular and limited edition. A price reduction on End of Eternity,
3989880	3993580	but a new game Need for Speed Hot Pursuit over there in Japan and Your Shape Fitness
3993580	3997240	Evolved. Looks like some of those Kinect games took a little bit longer to localize, but
3997240	4001440	they're finally making their way over to Japan. On the PlayStation 3, also Assassin's Creed
4001440	4006440	Brotherhood. Price reduction on End of Eternity, a game called Free Free Bowling, which I'm
4006440	4013840	thinking is the Move bowling game localized for Japan, and a USB Neo Geo pad from SNK
4013840	4019680	Play More comes out this week. It is basically a Neo Geo pad with six buttons for fighting
4019680	4024680	games, probably for use with some of the Neo Geo games that are on PlayStation Network.
4024680	4030680	Going over to the Nintendo Wii this week in Japan, Donkey Kong Returns makes its way out.
4030680	4035560	Uh, for once, we got a game about a week before they did. Fitness Party also comes out from
4035560	4043720	Namco Bandai, and a karaoke game called Karaoke Joy Sound Wii Super DX Hitori de Mina de Utai
4043720	4049760	Hodai comes out from Hudson this week. That is a hell of a name there. The name doesn't
4049760	4056720	quite make sense to me. Hitori de Mina, that's like, okay. It looks a little bit like Karaoke
4056720	4062080	Revolution meets once in a while the actual music video, but otherwise it's party girls
4062080	4067160	dancing on a stage. Like, I don't even, I can't even. Is there Para Para? There's no
4067160	4071680	Para Para. Not worth it. How about Pac-Man Party? That is also coming out in Japan this
4071680	4076120	week, and Boom Blocks gets a price reduction in Japan. Oops, sorry, that's the 16th, that's
4076120	4081640	next week. Sorry. So let me keep going with this week on the Nintendo DS. Castlevania
4081640	4086840	Dawn of Sorrow gets a price reduction, so does Ganbare Goemon. As far as new games though,
4086840	4092440	one of the ones you might want to check out is Ninokuni Shikoku no Madoushi comes out
4092440	4100440	this week. This is, it's an RPG from level 5 and, dammit, I think this is out here in
4100440	4105560	the US as something else and I can't tell what it is. But it's an RPG from level 5 in
4105560	4109000	Japan, I'm sure somebody in the chatroom will correct me soon enough. There's actually an
4109000	4113400	official website for it. Should I look at it real quick? I think this is a pretty big
4113400	4118640	DS title. Maybe somebody in chat knows the rest. As far as the Sony PSP goes, not a lot
4118640	4122200	of big stuff this week, although there's some price reductions on things like Valkyria Chronicles
4122200	4131040	2 and Kuroganni no Lene Barrels, Hudson the best. Oh, you know what this game is? I believe
4131040	4137000	this is the DS game that's made with Studio Ghibli. That's what this is. Cause the artwork
4137000	4144200	looks very, very, uh, like that. I think that's what this is. So I don't think it is out here
4144200	4147360	in the US, but I think I've read about it, that's why it sounds familiar to me. Yeah,
4147360	4151800	look at this, this looks like Studio Ghibli, doesn't it? With the little guy with the lantern
4151800	4156480	on his nose and everything? That's gotta be what this is. Nice. No other studio puts lanterns
4156480	4161320	on noses. No, no other studio would do that. There we go, thank you, chatroom's jumping
4161320	4165280	in there saying yes to Studio Ghibli, it's the one with the huge 300 page magic book,
4165280	4169840	that is Dungeon Buster. Thank you. I figured it out eventually. Alright, Dark Sakura, how
4169840	4176720	about the UK? In the UK we have a number of games, although not many. On the 7th is Alien
4176720	4183460	Breed 2 Assault and Bejeweled 3 and World of Warcraft Cataclysm, sorry. Hater. I'm not.
4183460	4190120	On the 8th is Bomberman Live Battlefest. And then on the 10th we have Cave Story and Golden
4190120	4200200	Sun Dark Dawn. Oooh. Alright. And that's about it. Alright, not a bad week all things considered,
4200200	4203920	I mean considering we're getting really close to Christmas, I mean, whether Dark Sakura
4203920	4207600	likes it or not, Warcraft's gonna be a huge game, and hey, there's Tron, and there's...
4207600	4214440	I don't give a crap about Wordcraft or Warcraft. I mean, to be honest, I just do it to give
4214440	4218720	you a hard time. There's Plants vs Zombies is in it now, that's all I'm saying. I just
4218720	4224080	like giving you a hard time about it. I know you do. Mwah, mwah, mwah. A couple more news
4224080	4230840	stories for you guys. I'm a Vice Admiral. And then the classic game of the week. Yes.
4230840	4235840	So this is kinda cool. You know, and they were talking about possibly making a game
4235840	4240920	based on this, but now it's been confirmed that Christopher Nolan is actually working
4240920	4247560	on an Inception video game. And I think that's really cool. Love the world of Inception.
4247560	4253600	Love the movie. I still haven't seen it. But it comes out on Blu-ray this week, so I plan
4253600	4257160	to rent it. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Do not watch anything else. Because I'm sitting
4257160	4261760	here going, all I know is that there's a room spinny thing that might be cool in a video
4261760	4265000	game, but otherwise I don't know why this would make a good video game. Can you tell
4265000	4269120	me why this is gonna be an awesome video game without spoiling the movie? Okay, think of
4269120	4277680	it, it's like, it'd be like why the, except, you know, the MMO sucked, like The Matrix,
4277680	4282360	why The Matrix was kind of a cool movie. It's really the environment of it and everything.
4282360	4286800	It's just a really neat concept. The Matrix game that was on like GameCube and PS2 was
4286800	4290880	not as terrible as I think some made it out to be. Here, let me put it this way. Inception
4290880	4296440	has that vibe of the first Matrix movie. Like, you know, they set up a world, it's kind of
4296440	4301360	similar to our world and stuff, there's a lot of gun combat and stuff like that, and
4301360	4306040	then there's a lot of weird twists and stuff to it and ways they can manipulate the world
4306040	4311320	and stuff like that. Before Neo got way too damn powerful, you know, it's the cool part
4311320	4317480	of The Matrix. Without the other movies. Okay. Yeah, so it's got that vibe to it and it's
4317480	4324520	really awesome. That could be cool. Yes, and that Joseph Gordon Lovett guy, man, it's fucking
4324520	4331040	awesome. That's the kid from Third Rock from the Sun, or he was also the kid in Dark Shadows
4331040	4336480	years and years ago. Did you ever see that movie Brick? You need to see Brick. No, I
4336480	4341660	haven't seen Brick, but he was in some other movie I saw called Mysterious Skin and I kind
4341660	4345480	of felt dirty. I was like, this is the guy from Third Rock? He's a really good actor
4345480	4348840	nowadays. He's a pretty good actor. I think Mysterious Skin was by the guy and he does
4348840	4353640	all these messed up teen angst movies. He did like the Nowhere, I think was one, it
4353640	4358440	was totally fucked up and there's another one in that whole series. All those teen angst
4358440	4362760	movies and he did that too. Anyways, yeah, so he's an awesome character, or he plays
4362760	4368040	a really awesome character in the movie and then of course, you know, DiCaprio's alright.
4368040	4373920	But yeah, seriously, the movie Brick though, it's a film noir set in a high school. In
4373920	4380380	modern day high school. It's really awesome. All the dialogue though is like film noir.
4380380	4385040	It's just so badass. It's just, you gotta see it. It's really cool. I'll take your word
4385040	4390960	for it. Anyways, yeah, Inception, amazing movie. So the video game, you know, games
4390960	4395280	based off movies aren't that great all the time, but if Christopher Nolan's actually
4395280	4406200	working on it, maybe it'll do alright. Basically he says now, he was considering putting together
4406200	4412640	a video game based on the movie, but it looks like he's actually, his plans are going a
4412640	4416920	little bit further than that. He says he's told Entertainment Weekly that the project
4416920	4423760	is a go and that he's working with a full team on the game as a longer term proposition.
4423760	4428120	He's excited to explore the medium of gaming by creating a new story set in the world of
4428120	4436880	the movie. Entertainment Weekly suggests an MMO, but hopefully it's something better than
4436880	4442640	that. Interesting. I could see an MMO, but the problem I see with an MMO though, is that
4442640	4447440	it's gonna be like The Matrix Online. The Matrix Online just had some flaws. Like The
4447440	4453200	Matrix could have made an awesome MMO. It's just that what they released wasn't it. Just
4453200	4457440	like the Wachowski Brothers could have made an awesome trilogy. But they're like, let's
4457440	4464040	give Neo all these powers all of a sudden. To this day I've never seen the third movie.
4464040	4467600	To this day I've never seen the third movie. You're not missing much, it has an ending
4467600	4471920	reminiscent of a Highlander 2, which was also a crappy movie. That's what I hear. Wait,
4471920	4474720	but didn't Highlander 2, wasn't that the one that introduced Sean Connery? Or was he in
4474720	4478800	the first one too and I just forgot? The first one. Dude, he was Ramirez. I forgot. You know
4478800	4482680	how many years it's been since I've seen Highlander? That was like in college where everybody got
4482680	4486800	high and watched Highlander, but I didn't cause I'm... It's called Highlander man, you
4486800	4495680	gotta watch it high. I went to Chico State folks, enough said. Enough said. As you drive
4495680	4499880	up 99 and it starts to smell like marijuana, it's cause you're passing through Chico on
4499880	4505280	your way to Humboldt. Although actually that's 101. But forget it. Anyway, how about another
4505280	4509680	news story that isn't drug induced. Let's talk about, well you might be able to watch
4509680	4513820	a lot of Cheech and Chong movies on this though if this comes true. Microsoft is apparently
4513820	4518880	in talks, this is if you want to believe Reuters, to bring subscription television and networks
4518880	4525220	to Xbox Live. This strikes me as kind of a duh. I think Microsoft's been slowly moving
4525220	4530080	in this direction, but whatever, fine. At least we have a little more news to it. At
4530080	4535000	least courtesy of Reuters, who's like the Associated Press. Apparently Microsoft is
4535000	4539480	having meetings with various media companies to talk about licensing TV programs to be
4539480	4547000	streamed through a Xbox application. The talks apparently are going well. Although, excuse
4547000	4553160	me, I have a frog in my throat, like if anyone saw that Susan Boyle clip from TV this week.
4553160	4558320	Xbox Live TV is apparently a year away at least, which makes sense to me. If they actually
4558320	4561640	are going to do something like this, they'll announce it at E3 and roll it out during the
4561640	4568760	holidays. There is the possibility there that there will be interactive elements into shows
4568760	4574080	viewed on the console and that there'll be also content silos, meaning that like HBO
4574080	4579560	and Showtime could have their own little areas to subscribe to. So, could be interesting.
4579560	4584020	I like this because remember when I talked about the whole one versus 100 getting canceled,
4584020	4589400	I was like, why doesn't Xbox make more of a network out of this? I was kind of talking
4589400	4596760	about this. I like this whole idea of interactivity or more interactive shows. Like, I think Xbox
4596760	4601680	had a great thing with one versus 100 and it's a damn shame that they lost the rights
4601680	4605520	to the new Game Show Network version or whatever the hell it is that's going on. Which, by
4605520	4609680	the way, have you seen the new Game Show Network version with Carrie Ann Inaba as the host?
4609680	4615800	Yeah. It's not as fun as it was on Xbox Live, sorry to say. I'm actually really into something
4615800	4620800	like this. I just hope the interactive stuff isn't cheesy. Like, you see a lot of Blu-ray
4620800	4626640	discs that have the interactive movie component, which is just asking dumb poll questions and
4626640	4631440	things. Like, I would like them to see them do more like interactive game shows. We've
4631440	4635920	had the rumor of a Poker Night game that's apparently in top secret testing right now.
4635920	4641920	I mean, maybe there's a show to be made of that. I don't know. What if you could vote
4641920	4647120	on the ending? Vote on a character getting killed off or what have you. American Idol
4647120	4650480	being voted on through your Xbox. X Factor on Xbox.
4650480	4654680	I would think, if anything, what the interactive part might be is like marking clips or something
4654680	4659920	like that and sharing them with friends. Say, hey, have you seen this? This is pretty cool.
4659920	4668200	Hey, look, it's a nipple slip. Wait, so you think this is more like a TiVo that you could
4668200	4672640	share? So if there's ever another Janet Jackson booby that slips out, people could be like,
4672640	4675240	hey, I saw this awesome clip I wanted to share with my friends.
4675240	4680960	Well, it's like, I guess, Justin TV where you can save clips and stuff.
4680960	4684160	Oh, God. I hope we're not going to be life casting through our Xbox. There's certain
4684160	4689880	people I don't want to see their lives. I mean, the Kinect is putting a camera in all
4689880	4695320	of our homes, but this is not an idea I like. Although, oh, my God, could you imagine, like
4695320	4699400	now when they do one versus 100, like with two and a half million Kinects out there and
4699400	4706920	growing, they could have the one be on TV with the whole Kinect thing, which is a nice
4706920	4709360	little camera in your house.
4709360	4710640	Yeah.
4710640	4720880	It's alive. And then the Xbox 720 will just be called Skynet. That's that's where we go
4720880	4728920	from here, right? Chat dot orange launch radio dot com if you want to chime in on this live
4728920	4729920	with us.
4729920	4738280	Well, isn't Sky a service that's in the UK and technically isn't it a network?
4738280	4742840	Have you seen this boy? He's on in our chat room, says that's the new show on current
4742840	4747120	TV Bar Karma. Viewers make the story and they produce it.
4747120	4753440	Here's a question. This is totally random. And they've got to have this like some sort
4753440	4757560	of photoshopped, you know, have you seen this boy with pedo bear?
4757560	4759880	I'm sure it exists somewhere.
4759880	4761880	That'd be funny.
4761880	4762880	Absolutely.
4762880	4768640	Let's see the name that I can ever pronounce. Majinomicon in our chat room says D.C. figured
4768640	4772440	out a way to capitalize on this. They announced a telephone poll for readers to decide whether
4772440	4773440	he lived or died.
4773440	4774440	Jason Todd.
4774440	4776920	Yep. Ten thousand votes later, he was dead.
4776920	4777920	Everyone hated Jason Todd.
4777920	4778920	Yeah, but that.
4778920	4781400	And guess what? He's live again.
4781400	4786160	You know what? They did that in the 70s with Andy Kaufman on Saturday Night Live. So I
4786160	4790240	don't know if that's really remember. Well, I know none of you were alive when this happened.
4790240	4793320	I remember that. It was 10 years before I was born.
4793320	4797760	Wasn't in the Man on the Moon movie. I don't know. But they did a whole viewer poll thing
4797760	4805480	to banish Andy Kaufman from Saturday Night Live. And he was banished. Or I remember.
4805480	4809800	I'm going to really date myself and make myself super lame here, but I don't give a fuck.
4809800	4814920	All right. Do you remember I'm married with children? They had a night where you could
4814920	4820880	vote on the ending if Al Bundy was going to actually tell Peg he loved her or not. Like
4820880	4824680	it was a whole I think it was for Valentine's Day. And you could actually call in and vote
4824680	4830160	on the ending where if Al Bundy is going to say, I love you, Peg, or just go to bed without
4830160	4838400	saying it because the whole episode was about Peg was whining. Oh, Al.
4838400	4842960	You never you never say I love you to me or whatever was the whole plot. That was such
4842960	4851160	a great show. I'm sorry. But they had an interactive episode. So, you know, but that's did they
4851160	4856080	from what I remember? Yes. He he said, I love you at the end of the night. It was all the
4856080	4862720	women voting. But anyway, I wanted to give you beer more often. I said that to get a
4862720	4866120	reaction out of dark soccer and didn't really get one. All right. I gave him I gave him
4866120	4870000	a look. I did get side eye a little bit. It doesn't transfer well to radio side. I like
4870000	4879040	Anyway, Rob gets a snort. I don't remember what I was busy looking at gay. I also remember
4879040	4884120	an episode if you can't do that on television where you could vote, but that wasn't real.
4884120	4889600	I remember dating myself that does not compute episode where they used gray slime. Thank
4889600	4896680	God SSJ 100. Matt in our chat room says I remember this. Thank God it's not just me.
4896680	4900460	I grew up. I'm married with children. That was my show. All right. Speaking of blast
4900460	4903880	from the past. We like to do a segment here on the show where dark soccer digs through
4903880	4912880	the archives of gaming and finds a game that she says, Hey, Hey, you. Hey, listen, my line.
4912880	4922200	Oh, Al, I found the gayest game ever. Oh, Dan. You should play this game. I've been
4922200	4925880	trying to get him to download it for me and he won't do it out of pure principle. So somebody
4925880	4930600	needs to get it for me. All right, dark soccer. What is the classic game of the week? Joe
4930600	4938320	on a key. Like I said, gayest game ever. I'm kind of sad that I asked, but here you go.
4938320	4946520	Seriously, when I told Rob I was picking it, he replied with LOL game. So funny key. It
4946520	4953560	means super big brother. It's a game series done by Masa. Yeah. And published by NSC core.
4953560	4960440	It came out in 1992 for the PC engine with lots of spinoffs and sequels and other versions.
4960440	4967280	It's a mostly most versions are side scrolling, shoot them up, plays kind of like Gradius.
4967280	4974420	We did get Joe on a key on virtual console and somebody needs to give it to me because
4974420	4977560	I've actually still been looking for Hugh Carter of this. I would love to have a copy
4977560	4986080	of Joe on a key. So yeah, to start with the first game, the plot is, has the heroes who
4986080	4993800	are these big buff muscle bound men in Speedos. Going through different areas, space, ruins,
4993800	5001480	cities, fighting alien invaders and Bo Emperor Bill, which is built a bit, which is supposed
5001480	5010040	to be a short of body build, is basically man who achieved 10 consecutive victories
5010040	5016860	in the great galaxy body building contest is facing an ever decreasing supply of protein.
5016860	5024060	So he's invading other star systems to establish protein factories. And so the heaven realm
5024060	5033800	sent Eda Ten and Ben Ten to take over Bo Emperor Bill. And so it's a sweaty, hot muscle battle.
5033800	5043200	Yes. But the main characters actually in this one was, Eda Ten was just a pretty guy and
5043200	5048840	Ben Ten who was a girl blue hair. And then you have the muscle bound men, Samson and
5048840	5056800	Adon who are the muscle bound men in Speedos and they hover around and they are the brothers.
5056800	5065160	So yeah, it's weird. Basically the whole genre of games that these are in are what's called,
5065160	5073160	they're very kitschy. They're called bakage, which is like idiot game, sort of a lighter
5073160	5084600	of the kusoge, which kuso means shit. Shit game. So this is bakage. It's campy. It's
5084600	5092760	really weird and fun. It's half naked men in suggestive homoerotic poses. And fairly
5092760	5102640	neat. It's not really pornographic, just gay. GAY! And the rights to the series are now
5102640	5108400	actually owned by Extreme Co. Limited. So the different games in this series, we have
5108400	5116200	chowaniki, we have ai chowaniki, which ai means love, so we have love super big brother.
5116200	5120680	And it has a slightly different control scheme. You can actually do special attacks by doing
5120680	5127880	street fighter style button meshes. And in this one you fight the, you actually have
5127880	5136760	to raise the Nioh builder army, well the bad guy. His name is Botekunshiyasu, which is
5136760	5145000	body conscious, it's a pun, to fight Ita-ten and Ben-ten. And they fall in love and elope.
5145000	5153480	So Samson and Adon have to fight. And it's, yeah. It came out on Virtual Console Japan
5153480	5160520	in 2007. Chowaniki Bakuretsu Rantohen, which is a different one, it's a fighting game.
5160520	5167520	You have Ita-ten, Ben-ten, Samson and Adon. They attack by gyrating and flatulating.
5167520	5174360	You have Sabu, who is a pagoda shaped ship with Elvis Presley on the top. Mommy 19, it's
5174360	5182040	a cute girl mixed with a battleship, transporting three naked folicing men. You have Adam, who
5182040	5188400	is actually Adam from the creation, who is half naked and riding on the moon. You have
5188400	5196160	Bote, who is the guy from the first game. And Umimin, who is a latex creature that looks
5196160	5206080	like a condom. So, yeah, interesting. We also have Chowaniki Kyukyoku Meteki Genga Saikyou
5206080	5213520	Otoko, which translates to, um, the ultimate most strongest man in the galaxy. Or the ultimate
5213520	5218520	invincible most galactically powerful man. And it's based off the first Chowaniki. And
5218520	5225920	it's, uh, Ita-ten and Ben-ten from the first game. Um, yeah, it's still weird. Um, it's
5225920	5231880	actually available for download on PlayStation Network, uh, in North America. So, get it
5231880	5237200	and then send it to me. And then we also have the Wonder Swan version, Chowaniki Otoko no
5237200	5245760	Tamahuda. Um, it's actually, um, I've explained what Hanafuda is before, haven't I? I think
5245760	5249160	so. Nintendo started off as a Hanafuda company. It's playing cards. It's a type of playing
5249160	5252840	card game. Right. Sorry, I just want to, I switched the music to the ending from the
5252840	5257480	PC Engine version because I wanted to see it. Okay. So, sorry. It's okay. Um, but it's
5257480	5262960	actually a portmanteau of Tamashi, which is Soul, and Hanafuda, which is a card game.
5262960	5271320	So it's like, it could also mean balls. Tama. Balls. Anyway. Um, it was on the Wonder Swan.
5271320	5278680	I came really close to buying this once. Then, what? You, you said something. Oh no, I was
5278680	5282400	just, I was gonna say, you know what's funny is that, you know, obviously I know of this
5282400	5286140	game because, you know, I've been doing this show for a while and how can you not know
5286140	5291160	about this game, but, uh, I've never played it. Believe it or not. I've never played this
5291160	5297960	game. Well, um. It looks like I just kinda look at it with a raised eyebrow going, what?
5297960	5302640	Which I'm sure is what most people do. And it's probably the point. Okay. Well, um, the
5302640	5310160	last, uh, one on my list is Choeiniki Senaru Protein Densetsu, which is Legend of the Holy
5310160	5316320	Protein. Wow. And it's done by the group that did Sengoku Blade. Holy Protein? Holy Protein
5316320	5322000	Batman. I'm just gonna read exactly what's on the article. The plot of the game centers,
5322000	5328520	actually, centers on the Holy Protein, a deity-like glob of what may be semen. Samson and Adon
5328520	5336040	hover around the glob, absorbing enemy fire as they did in the previous game. Yeah, um,
5336040	5343960	yeah. And it has, um, a Mona Lisa painting that fires lasers from its eyes, and a giant
5343960	5350120	cross-dressing man in a maid outfit. So yeah. Um, and then there was Choeiniki Zero, which
5350120	5357560	came out by, um, Extreme Co. Limited, and, uh. But the whole thing with Choeiniki is
5357560	5365680	that it's so completely freakin' nuts that you can't help but love it. I mean, there's
5365680	5371680	actually, uh, Masaya made a game called, um, well, a series called Langrisser, which I've
5371680	5377400	played a few of those games. Um, but Samson and all of them are in it. You have to go
5377400	5382960	to the Muscle Shrine where you fight Samson, and then you can use the Aniki Summon. It's
5382960	5387120	on the Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, and PlayStation versions, which I've played the Super Nintendo
5387120	5395920	in. Um, Capcom game God Hand makes fun of Samson and Adon as powerless, powerless yet
5395920	5402200	flamboyant drag queens, who are the first bosses in the game. Wow. Yeah. Um, they, uh,
5402200	5409240	they have, uh, Samson and Adon have a weapon called Men's Beam, which is white energy from
5409240	5423040	holes in their head. Wow. Yeah. It's just, it's gay. And I'm saying this, it's gay. Like,
5423040	5429360	I don't really think it's gay as in homosexual, it's more like gay as in, um, Christmas. You
5429360	5434360	know, don't we now our gay apparel? That's, that's where we're at. I think that it's full
5434360	5441480	of penis references, and naked men in speedos, and drag queens. Uh, AlphaKananagram in our
5441480	5444520	chatroom says, Sky, I tried gifting you Choe and Iki on virtual consoles. Is that what
5444520	5449120	you talked about? I don't remember playing it. Maybe I did, and I just blocked it from
5449120	5453960	my mind. DDRDollarBill in our chatroom says, gay isn't the word I'd use for Choe and Iki.
5453960	5464280	Yeah, I'm not so sure. I think I might use the word what. I want it. All right. Anyhow,
5464280	5468200	there it is, your classic game of the week. If Dark Soccer is all finished over there,
5468200	5477800	Choe and Iki on various systems. And honestly, Rob, after I've played, I've played like a
5477800	5485160	couple of them. They're actually really fun. But it's so bizarre. And I just mean, you
5485160	5489040	can't help but laugh and be happy while you're playing it. Because it's naked. Well then
5489040	5494480	it is gay. Because gay means happy. And I wasn't meaning like. I know, I know. You know
5494480	5501040	what I mean. I know what you mean. It's just, it was, it's gorgeous. It's like, it's, it's
5501040	5510200	beautiful. Penis. I'm 12. I'm gonna need to crop that and play, add that to the sound
5510200	5514120	board at some point. All right, just, just messing. All right, we're gonna take a break,
5514120	5517720	but don't go anywhere guys. We'll be right back. Your Twitter topics, and God, you saw
5517720	5521440	what came last week and what that became. So who knows what's on the Twitter this week.
5521440	5525680	So get those in at twitter.com slash o-l-r. We're gonna also get to the mailbag and we're
5525680	5529760	gonna talk about some other news stories. We're gonna talk about some goings-on in Xbox
5529760	5534720	Live Arcade. We're gonna talk about the future of arcade games in another country. And we're
5534720	5540340	gonna talk about a game that is being pirated that's doing something kind of lolsy. Especially
5540340	5543760	if you're Dark Soccer, you're gonna find this pretty lolsy. So we'll be back after this
5543760	5552560	quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5552560	5557240	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has
5557240	5563360	a voice. We are taping live our 392nd episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December the
5563360	5570440	5th, right, of 2010. I lost track of time. Only 20 shopping days left. Actually no, not
5570440	5576280	even that many. 19. Uh oh. Oh well. Anyhow, this is the part of the show where we like
5576280	5579680	to welcome you guys back. We're gonna get into the rapid fire news in a minute. But
5579680	5584100	I want to bring up a couple things. First, since I didn't mention shopping days and shopping
5584100	5589440	going on, have you guys like kind of gone out and tried to brave the masses going on
5589440	5592160	right now? Like I'll tell you, I was in the mall yesterday and it had nothing to do with
5592160	5596720	shopping. Well, it did. I was getting a card for somebody. But I happen to be at the mall
5596720	5601840	and uh, it was a madhouse. But I went into GameStop and they were having some pretty
5601840	5607040	interesting deals. I damn near bought a copy of Borderlands for 18 bucks used. But then
5607040	5610280	Alan was like, well, but you want to get the PC version so you can play with me. And I'm
5610280	5614480	like, oh yeah, that's true. And you want to get the game of the year version so you can
5614480	5620240	play Duke Nukem Forever earlier. True, but that's also more, more money. Like $18 to
5620240	5623360	see if I, cause I don't know if I'm gonna like it or not. You're gonna love it. Seriously.
5623360	5627040	You think? All right, we'll see. We'll see. But then I'm also like, well shit, Cataclysm
5627040	5632400	is coming out this week. Or you could borrow my copy. I like that idea. Well then also
5632400	5635880	there's always the whole like, I could just play it on Alan's computer, but we always
5635880	5640340	get distracted because like, oh, but we really need to run a raid and wow, oh boy, we really
5640340	5646120	need to go out and drink or whatever we're doing. So anyhow, I have either of you guys
5646120	5652480	been to the stores and looked at deals? Well, I didn't specifically go shopping. Um, when
5652480	5657560	Marissa was here, we went over to the Arden Fair Mall. Ooh. And we just walked and looked
5657560	5664600	at stuff and I popped into Forever 21 and looked at jackets cause I liked some of the
5664600	5667160	clothes there. I wouldn't wear all of it, but I liked some of it. Was that a freaking
5667160	5670640	mad house though? Like the rest of the malls seem to be? Yeah, it was kind of crazy, but
5670640	5674840	not so bad. I mean, I went into, you see, wait, wait, I did buy something. Oh, it's
5674840	5680920	not in here. I bought this gorgeously obnoxious leopard print purse at Claire's. I remember
5680920	5687040	you for $5 cause you're a 12 year old girl. Yes. It was cute. Shut up. So I bought, I
5687040	5691280	bought a leopard print purse cause I thought it was cute and adorable and I like, I like
5691280	5696720	stuff. I'm a girl. Loud. Just cause I'm wearing pyramid head today doesn't mean I'm not going
5696720	5698920	to be fashionable tomorrow. First I thought you were looking down cause you said I'm a
5698920	5701960	girl and then he kind of looked down like as if you were checking your breasts to make
5701960	5707400	sure they were still there. Look how I bounce. But you were looking at pyramid head on your
5707400	5715280	shirt. All right. P Hiddy. All right. Special to me. Tons of kids at the mall too. Oh my
5715280	5722960	God. Kids everywhere at the mall. Oof. And I went to target boy. It's, that's an even
5722960	5726440	bigger mad house. Anyway, I won't bore you with that. What I will bore you with is a
5726440	5730760	talk about our spinoff shows. If you like orange lounge radio, why don't you take a
5730760	5737080	minute to check out our spinoff shows. Dark Sakura. She does a podcast called comic insanity.
5737080	5743120	It's all about comics and it's with her buddies Tiara and Dan shadow and it's every Tuesday
5743120	5746960	and you can find it on itunes. And this all this month we'll be having a special, which
5746960	5750400	is our year end review of comics. Oh boy. So now you know what you got to catch up on.
5750400	5754600	You get to see how much we are, you know, PO'd with Matt fraction. All right. Now do
5754600	5759000	you remember the show? I do. I plugged your show. You remember my show? The one with Dolly
5759000	5765880	Parton and her boobs. Oh, sorry. It's best little hoard house in whatever fucking planet
5765880	5772760	that is. Azeroth. Yes. Azeroth. Yeah. Okay. But yeah, it's there. You're cute. You and
5772760	5776800	you and extra for, you're adorable. We had a fun show this week. Actually. We had a special
5776800	5781400	guest. A frat. Matt is what I call him online, but a grandpa Warcraft is what we were calling
5781400	5785360	him because he's been playing and you know, Matt, he's been playing a Warcraft since vanilla.
5785360	5788900	So we were calling grandpa Warcraft. It was a good show. Wow. So I have absolutely no
5788900	5794480	idea what that means. He's old and he plays Warcraft. That's what it means. Uh, and also,
5794480	5799280	uh, we have a huge show plan. That's not really, we're just doing the same old show, but it
5799280	5803640	is cataclysm. The third expansion of wow does come out this week. It's a pretty big deal.
5803640	5811320	So we're going to go plans versus zombies. Yeah. The sad thing is it goes live at midnight
5811320	5816520	tomorrow and I got to go to bed cause of work. I can't stay up and play wow. And then Tuesday
5816520	5820600	I have to go bake cookies cause there's this whole cookie party. Yes. There is a cookie
5820600	5830400	party going on at work. That's why the show got canceled. That was the best part of the
5830400	5835560	Sarah Silverman show was cookie party with what was the host name? Miss something on
5835560	5840160	cookie party. Forget it. All the listeners at home are like, I thought this was a video
5840160	5847120	game podcast. Anyhow, let's do some rapid fire news and remind them that it is a game
5847120	5850760	podcast. Uh, Loki, what do you got for us? By the way, Twitter last chance, twitter.com
5850760	5856560	slash O L R for Twitter topics tonight. Yes. Uh, cool stuff. Uh, you may remember that
5856560	5863600	Ghostbusters a game that came out almost a year and a half ago. Um, there is a few achievements
5863600	5869840	that were unable to be achieved, I guess, because the game was broken and uh, well apparently
5869840	5876960	they have actually, um, just, uh, put through Xbox live certification, the, uh, update that
5876960	5883320	will fix those. And, um, I guess these now four achievements that were unable to be unlocked
5883320	5888820	before, um, are being fixed. So that's kind of cool that they're actually still working
5888820	5894900	on patches for games despite the fact that they came out long time ago. So, um, neat.
5894900	5898880	And then of course if you're a fan of Ghostbusters, you'll be happy to know that Ghostbusters sanctum
5898880	5905720	of slime will be coming to Xbox live arcade and PlayStation network and PC next spring.
5905720	5910400	And the game is a little bit different than the one that was on Xbox 360 and PlayStation
5910400	5916760	three, uh, previously from terminal reality. Uh, this is actually going to be, um, kind
5916760	5923280	of a top down action game. And they're saying that it's being developed by the assault heroes
5923280	5930120	creator, uh, one echo and it's a four player online and a co you know, local co-op, a top
5930120	5934520	down action game that's gonna not really have any of the voice actors because you know,
5934520	5940660	they're expensive and um, they're not really sure if, uh, you know, the characters from
5940660	5944060	the movie obviously are going to be there or they're going to be replaced by a new team
5944060	5950720	or something like that. Um, but yeah, it's a pretty awesome looking actually from some
5950720	5957000	of the screenshots that they had. So that'll be coming sometime soon next year. Uh, game
5957000	5960840	loft is announcing some new games. They actually had some pretty decent ones when they're not
5960840	5969380	ripping off other games. Um, nice. Like I worked that in there. Uh, Nova two, it's their
5969380	5974520	first person shooter game. That's kind of a little bit like halo. It's inspired, I guess
5974520	5978000	if you will, but it's actually pretty solid. I thought you said they weren't ripping off
5978000	5983400	other games anymore. It's a sci fi shooter. Okay. So you know, whatever. All right. But
5983400	5987240	it's actually pretty cool. Um, it adds new weapons, new enemies and uh, the new enemies
5987240	5993000	of course have jet packs and uh, we'll offer a multiplayer and I guess it, uh, continues
5993000	5997400	the story of the first game. Uh, but I guess people that have the original wall so get
5997400	6002560	rewarded different, uh, with some bonus XP. And then they have shadow guardian, which
6002560	6008400	is a new IP for game loft and it's kind of similar to like an uncharted or tomb Raider
6008400	6015960	game. It's more of like a, an action, um, adventure game. So, uh, it looks very uncharted
6015960	6022720	esque, but um, you know, nice to see some sophisticated games coming to iOS despite
6022720	6026640	the fact game office really hit or miss with some of this stuff. But, um, yeah, the original
6026640	6031840	IP stuff's not bad. You know, they're gang star or whatever. Um, it's not a bad clone
6031840	6042400	of like the old PSP or PlayStation two grand theft auto games. And then, um, let's see,
6042400	6048960	Def Jam. Uh, this is kind of interesting in the UK. Uh, Def Jam is, um, do their rap star
6048960	6056000	game. They're having a competition that offers the winner, um, a record contract. Apparently,
6056000	6062640	um, they're going to be teaming up, I guess, with Atlantic records, UK, and they're giving
6062640	6069600	a one lucky UK resident chance to, um, have their very own record. And they're going to
6069600	6075440	be employing the game's freestyle mode and contestants will upload their hottest, um,
6075440	6080680	40 bars, uh, give or take. And they're going to be judged by the Def Jam rap star community
6080680	6086280	because they do have a really big, uh, community aspect to the game, actually, despite the
6086280	6089480	fact that a lot of people don't. I had a chance to get this game. I was going to get it for
6089480	6095800	just the microphone, you know, cause I got it for free. I actually passed. Wow. It wasn't
6095800	6100240	a bad game. I mean, I don't listen to really the, I mean, maybe there's a couple songs
6100240	6105320	in there. I know, but it's not the type of game. I can't see myself honestly playing
6105320	6109760	this game. Especially I live by myself and a lot of my gaming is alone, so I just can't
6109760	6117320	see myself, you know, sitting there, you know, rapping by myself in my apartment. I mean,
6117320	6124760	there's just something kind of sad. I'm crying all night today cause I just watched a sad
6124760	6132920	movie. I'll play Def Jam rap star to make me feel better. Sip it on gin and juice. Uh,
6132920	6138100	it says the top regional finalists will then have to compete in front of a live audience
6138100	6144240	at the UK HMV, um, locations. Uh, they're saying eight mile style and that's going to
6144240	6152360	be in February. And of course that means that the winner, um, will be able to have the actual,
6152360	6158080	um, you know, record contract. See, Loki, you should be participating in this. That's
6158080	6165720	why you need the game. Yes. I bet anything. If you last night, I don't believe that Sacramento
6165720	6173480	is in the UK. Uh, you know, my basic geography knowledge says that's not correct. We need
6173480	6183160	to fix this. Just Kidman rap. What do we know to do it? Who else is in the UK? How about
6183160	6191920	Aki Ripper? Let's get Aki Ripper. Does Sweden count? Sweden? I don't know. We need to find
6191920	6200960	that out. All right. Anyhow, uh, yeah, I have some news, but whatever. It's just not as
6200960	6206480	cool as Swedish rap. A rock band reloaded is now available on the iOS systems, meaning
6206480	6212160	the iPhone, the iPod touch, the iPad. It's five bucks on the phones and phone with no
6212160	6218240	phone and $10 on the iPad. There's a new expert mode and apparently full vocal support. So
6218240	6223880	you could actually sit there and, you know, sing along with your phone. Uh, also the iPad
6223880	6228400	version now has split screen multiplayer and several different ways to have the action
6228400	6233040	on screen. You can reorient gameplay if you're a lefty. That's kind of cool. And apparently
6233040	6236360	there's a whole drum kit now that you can kind of have so you can kind of beat your
6236360	6242440	iPad. I guess that's how it works. Kind of neat. Uh, there are quite a few games available
6242440	6246800	when you initially download it, including a kryptonite three doors down. So what you
6246800	6252320	want by Beastie Boys, White Wedding by Billy Idol. God, I love that song. Uh, Call Me When
6252320	6256920	You're Sober by Evanescence. The Perfect Drug by Nine Inch Nails. Uh, Hella Good by No Doubt.
6256920	6261280	I mean, a lot of these games are sort of in, uh, the rock band game anyway. There's also
6261280	6266360	tracks that you can download in the music store. I guess there's some free tracks too
6266360	6269920	in the music store. Of course they're like indie bands and stuff, but the acrobats are
6269920	6275840	in there. Daylight and Dollar Short if you like the acrobats. Uh, a lot of people around
6275840	6280560	the internets were fans of Splosion Man. Remember that game that was on the indie marketplace?
6280560	6286280	Well, guess what? A sequel has been announced. Ms. Splosion Man. I know they're doing like
6286280	6290280	the whole Ms. Pac-Man thing, but seriously, they could have done Splosion Woman. I know.
6290280	6296080	I was gonna say, wouldn't that be Ms. Splosion Woman? Or maybe this is like a drag queen.
6296080	6300960	I don't know, but whatever. Uh, Ms. Splosion Man, whatever gender he or she happens to
6300960	6307240	be, is planned to come out in the fall of 2011. This is a really early announcement,
6307240	6314000	but there it is. Uh, the CCO Josh Baer of Twisted Pixel has said, quote, we could have
6314000	6318160	churned out new levels for Splosion Man, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new
6318160	6322520	gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff. But we didn't want to just do Splosion Man
6322520	6328340	2. It had to be something a little more interesting. That is why we're making Ms. Splosion Man.
6328340	6332200	There's actually a teaser trailer that's out there and everything, and as you can expect,
6332200	6339560	it pays homage to Ms. Pac-Man. World of Warcraft news, but not the kind that gets me excited.
6339560	6345640	Sorry, DarkSakura. World of Warcraft apparently is now streaming and playable on an HTC Desire.
6345640	6351680	Yeah, it's this whole little tech demo that was out there before. It's now been fully
6351680	6357320	realized apparently. An HTC Desire smartphone is running World of Warcraft, and I don't
6357320	6361180	know if it's like a streaming thing or what, but there's actually a demo that's out there
6361180	6365860	on YouTube. Um, I think it is a streaming thing that they're doing with this device
6365860	6370120	because they say you can do just about any game. And, uh, yep, they're playing World
6370120	6376960	of Warcraft. And, I mean, do we really need that on the phone? I just, it looks like it's
6376960	6382600	a pain in the ass to play, quite frankly. Whatever. I guess some people will be into
6382600	6389160	that. DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Well, we have a few things. Um, to, uh, start
6389160	6396360	us off with, uh, some Kirby. How about Kirby? Kirby's Epic Yarn will be out in 2011 for
6396360	6403880	our European friends, out on February 25th. I was trying to say 25th. It'll be 25th. So,
6403880	6411320	uh, you have to wait, but it's gonna be, uh, all cool. They have to change, you know, in
6411320	6416640	British English, I guess, so that it can be, you know, a duvet instead of a comforter,
6416640	6421680	and a lift instead of an elevator, and, uh, a boot instead of the trunk. You know, that
6421680	6429480	type of thing. And, uh, new, uh, characters for Super Street Fighter IV, we have Dun-dun-dun,
6429480	6436080	didn't we call it last, uh, last week? Oni Akuma, who is like Shin Akuma, who is the super
6436080	6443360	evil one. And then we have Evil Ryu. Rrrrr. So that's gonna be super hot, cause I loved
6443360	6450840	Evil Ryu. Of course, I would love to have Evil Sakura next. Dark Sakura. Ooh. And then,
6450840	6457520	for Rock Band, more download content, we get Queen! Finally, finally, finally. Um, it's,
6457520	6464720	uh, Rock Band 3, um, upgraded tracks from Lego Rock Band. Um, so here's what's, uh,
6464720	6470840	also gonna be in the Queen Extravaganza Pack 1. Hammer to Fall, Keep Yourself Alive, Now
6470840	6475720	I'm Here, Play the Game, Tenement Funster, We Are the Champions, We Will Rock You, and
6475720	6482480	the Rock Band 3 Enhanced Pack, I Want It All, I Want to Break Free, Killer Queen, One Vision,
6482480	6487520	Somebody to Love, and Under Pressure. I am so buying. Which also is David Bowie. I am
6487520	6491600	so buying that Enhanced Pack. So am I. The, uh, first pack is a lot of really, kind of
6491600	6495560	like, off-cut tracks, which, I mean, Queen is Queen, they're cool. With these, they threw
6495560	6499760	two big ones in there to kinda, uh, make it feel a little more valuable, but, uh, I definitely
6499760	6505000	want, like, all my favorite Queen songs are in that other pack, so. And for some reason,
6505000	6508840	this is weird, I never bought the Queen track pack in Rock Band originally. Like, I just
6508840	6512520	somehow missed it, or I wasn't playing Rock Band at the time. Like, there's already, like,
6512520	6517480	fifteen Queen songs available in there. And, I really need to get Sing Star Queen at some
6517480	6521400	point, cause I'm sure I can find it really cheap now. Just like Sing Star Abba is on,
6521400	6526120	like, every Target clearance rack. Really need to get Sing Star Queen. Going to our
6526120	6530160	chatroom at chat.orangelaungerady.com, there's some comments, uh, SSJ100Matt is talking about
6530160	6535080	Ms. Splosion Man. Ms. Splosion Man better have her making a sandwich in the end. Just
6535080	6542400	sayin'. Tigerclaw says, the third one should be Junior Explosion Man, or Baby Splosion
6542400	6550500	Man. Here you go. I don't know about explosion baby. Chat.orangelaungerady.com. I think there's
6550500	6554880	an indie game on the marketplace that is about, like, exploding babies, uh, that might be
6554880	6560600	what you're thinking of, I don't know. Hey, let's go to the tweeter! Twitter.com slash
6560600	6572660	O-L-R. Uh, SSJ100Matt is sending us a story courtesy of Travis Donovan. South Korea is
6572660	6578240	getting ready to set an internet curfew for young teens. Really, I had not heard about
6578240	6583920	this, but then again I did not listen to, um, USL last night, I was a very, er, on,
6583920	6589240	yeah, on Saturday night, I was a very naughty boy, I was out. Uh, but apparently South Korea,
6589240	6592480	although I notice I'm being linked to a story from Fox News, so take it from it with a grain
6592480	6599400	of salt. South Korea is, uh, apparently considering a nationally enforced gaming curfew, uh, in
6599400	6604080	an effort to, um, curb internet addiction. Cause you know a lot of times we've had those
6604080	6609240	crazy internet addicts story and they all seem to be out of South Korea. Well apparently
6609240	6614480	it will make it illegal for internet service providers if this bill is passed to give online
6614480	6621420	gaming access to users under the age of 16 between the hours of midnight and 6 AM. For
6621420	6625560	South Korean students this will mean no gaming at all. It's normal to be in school until
6625560	6632640	midnight due to extracurricular activities and studying. What? Wow. That, that, that
6632640	6637520	much study is actually pretty normal. Wow, makes me feel like a lazy asshole even though
6637520	6641440	I was doing like every extracurricular activity in high school, I was still home by seven
6641440	6649040	or eight o'clock. Dang. Alright, well, interesting. What do you guys think about this ban? They
6649040	6651800	would never get away with something like that here in the US, that's for sure. It's not
6651800	6655120	the government's responsibility. It's the parent's responsibility. If they're not doing
6655120	6662040	their job then it's... I agree. Nope, I agree 100%. It's not, not the government's responsibility
6662040	6668120	but whatever. Alright, moving on. Dark Tetsuya on Twitter wants to remind us of this and
6668120	6672080	yes this is something I definitely need to plug and we'll probably be plugging a little
6672080	6679320	more as we hit the deadline here but the USL-OLR Madness, this used to be called March Madness
6679320	6683680	but I guess they moved it from March. 2011 is now open for nominations. This is something
6683680	6687760	a little more that our buddies at Under Station Live do and they really involve themselves
6687760	6692520	with but we like to support it here at OLR and I know I have already submitted my list.
6692520	6698960	Now if you don't know what this is, it's basically a competition a la March Madness, the NCAA
6698960	6705740	competition to choose the greatest game ever. Now this game has changed from year to year.
6705740	6711100	I believe last year Chrono Trigger finally won which why I don't know, so many people
6711100	6715320	wank about that game. It's not that great people but Super Metroid has won previously
6715320	6720700	which I completely understand and support. Super Mario Brothers 3 has won before which
6720700	6726340	okay yeah Mario, Mario games got to win at some point. So who will win this year? IDK
6726340	6732140	but you need to submit your top 25 list to uslmadness at gmail.com. Now the deadline
6732140	6738300	is January 3rd, 2011 so you have a little while but don't procrastinate. Please don't
6738300	6742300	procrastinate. I've already sent my list in and you should send yours in too. Send it
6742300	6746620	in order from 1 to 25. More details available on our website at orangelandsradio.com and
6746620	6750900	I imagine it's available at Understation Live's website as well. They are live every Saturday
6750900	6756380	night right here at All Games Radio. We're going to some tweets from Spazinator. I agree
6756380	6763220	with Jamie's thoughts on Choniki. I got the PS1 and to say that it's weird and or gay
6763220	6768380	is an understatement. It's like saying water is wet. First it was a novelty for me but
6768380	6773740	once the novelty wore off I forgot about it. As long as you mean gay meaning happy I'm
6773740	6781660	okay with that. Well I mean it's full of homoerotic imagery. It is, it is but I just you know
6781660	6787980	whatever. And you know me I never use the word gay to mean anything. I know, I know.
6787980	6794380	I mean penis. But anyway there's a lot of games like that though where like once the
6794380	6799180	novelty wore off it's kind of over. There's sadly too many games like that out there but
6799180	6804000	whatever. Anyhow Tiger Claw sends us a variety of tweets. I seem to remember there's a two
6804000	6809520	tweet limit but I'm feeling generous and I had beer before the show tonight so I'm going
6809520	6813780	to let him have all three tonight because I'm kind and generous. First off the Toronto
6813780	6821020	Police recover half a million dollars in stolen Sony goods. They are on it up there in Canada.
6821020	6825940	The 39 year old man in Toronto was arrested for stealing half a million dollars. We're
6825940	6830180	assuming of course that's Canadian. I don't know because they call it dollars too. PlayStation
6830180	6836820	3's, PSP's and games. Apparently this was due to tractor trailers that were stolen on
6836820	6841660	November 15th and 16th in Brampton. These trailers had about half a million dollars
6841660	6847820	in PS3's, PSP's and video games. That's where all the Sony stuff went in Canada. Well the
6847820	6855740	39 year old was arrested and will be in court on January 10th of 2011. Tiger Claw also sends
6855740	6861220	us a link. Standalone motion sensing game console believes honesty is the best policy.
6861220	6865740	This is linked to a story on Joystiq. What is this all about? Apparently it's a knock
6865740	6873100	off of the Nintendo Wii. There's a system now called the Wireless 60 and there's a description
6873100	6879000	on the back of the box. This is great. The description on the back of the box says, if
6879000	6883860	you are looking to purchase or own an Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Wii or equivalent, this
6883860	6890960	product does not compare or compete with these technologies. Well that's, that's awfully
6890960	6895760	upfront and endearing. Thank you. Thank you for being honest. But I love that it is in
6895760	6899440	small print on the back. If you're looking for a Nintendo Wii or, but you know what?
6899440	6905460	These might not be what you wanted. Just, just saying. But if you want the golf kit
6905460	6912700	and the ping pong kit, this is the system for you. How much is one of these? They're
6912700	6917140	probably cheap. I don't know. Some of these games probably aren't much worse than a bunch
6917140	6920580	of the crap on the Wii honestly. You might be selling yourself short a little bit there
6920580	6932860	Wireless 60. I love the name too. It's just shy of being Wii 60. Think about it. And lastly
6932860	6937740	from Tigerclaw in our last tweet tonight at twitter.com slash o-l-r, people really did
6937740	6945760	buy Donkey Kong with bananas. Do you remember that there was this whole promo with the UK
6945760	6951860	gamers and the UK could actually buy the game with bananas? Yes. Apparently there were some
6951860	6957980	folks that actually braved the cold weather and 20 people walked away with the game having
6957980	6966940	paid for them in bananas. How many bananas? It just said a bunch of bananas. So we don't
6966940	6972340	know exactly how many but it was the first 20 people in line to give a bunch of bananas.
6972340	6977180	Sounds like a fun promo. And then all the staff's like what the fuck are we gonna do
6977180	6982540	with these bananas? It's basically a eat em! Dude, bananas are great. It's basically a
6982540	6986460	Black Friday-esque type of promotion. I mean Old Navy gave away Dance Central to like the
6986460	6991900	first few people in line right? So I mean you know that's not completely unheard of.
6991900	6996260	Alright that's gonna do it for Twitter topics tonight. Twitter.com slash o-l-r. In the meantime
6996260	7006140	back to more gaming news. Loki. Yes. So you know with, they had kind of an indie launch
7006140	7015060	thing for the Xbox Marketplace. Well now there's kind of the Microsoft Game Studios promotion
7015060	7019420	that they're doing for Xbox Marketplace and of course they have three games coming out
7019420	7025940	for the games for the holidays presented by Microsoft Game Studios. And these three games
7025940	7032620	would be including World of Keflings which does have avatar support in it. Rascals and
7032620	7041700	Elo Meelo. Even though Elo Meelo you can get it now if you know how. So each, looks like
7041700	7052580	they're gonna be 800 Microsoft points each or $10. And Elo Meelo of course is on Xbox
7052580	7056660	Live right now. There is a way to do that. Or you can wait to the official release which
7056660	7063540	is January 5th. And then of course. Now why would I want to wait? Exactly. Who wants to
7063540	7071940	wait? World of Keflings. That is kind of a puzzle slash racer mashup game. And that's
7071940	7079180	gonna be, I'm sorry, the puzzle racer is Rascals and that's gonna be coming out on 29th. World
7079180	7084460	of Keflings will be on the 22nd. Like I said those are each gonna be 800 Microsoft points
7084460	7090380	or $10. And of course if you buy more than one there's some bonuses that you get with
7090380	7096180	that. Not necessarily money back but some neat stuff anyways. You get cross unlockables
7096180	7102300	for each game. For example in Elo Meelo if you, you can get an unlockable Keflings or
7102300	7108460	Rascal costume for Elo or Meelo by purchasing the other games. Additionally you can also
7108460	7115860	unlock Elo and Doug as playable characters in Rascals. And you can also unlock Rascal
7115860	7123260	characters within Elo Meelo and World of Keflings by purchasing the full range of games as well.
7123260	7133460	Even crazier it says you can get Rascals early by buying World of Keflings. Rascals can be
7133460	7139420	bought from within that game a week before it's released on the 29th. Okay I have to
7139420	7143780	draw a map to follow all that but fine. So basically all these games are giving each
7143780	7147340	other the reach around essentially. Pretty much. Interesting. It's a throwaway reach
7147340	7151260	around. I kinda like that idea. I mean even though none of these games are things I'm
7151260	7154620	particularly excited about. I guess you never know though. I mean like I didn't think I'd
7154620	7161160	be excited about Super Meat Boy and it's pretty awesome. It's a neat promotion and very different
7161160	7166420	from what the summer one where it's just like buy X number of games, get points. You know
7166420	7171380	what I mean? Like I kinda like the idea they've got going on here a little better. So that's
7171380	7175620	kinda cool. I like the way the games are interacting with each other. Do you have any interest
7175620	7181660	in any of these games, Loki? Rascals kinda sounds neat. Uh, Elo and Meelo look kind of
7181660	7189340	cool. Uh, I never played Kingdom of Keflings so hmm. I know I never played Kingdom of Keflings
7189340	7192300	either but apparently it's pretty popular. But I thought it was only popular because
7192300	7199060	of the Avatar thing. But I don't know. Alright well moving on to a game I am really looking
7199060	7202300	forward to and I was very disappointed it didn't make this Christmas but whatever. It'll
7202300	7208780	come out soon enough when it's ready. Little Big Planet 2 is on its way pretty soon and
7208780	7212660	there's a beta going on right now. Now there's an update that happened on the PlayStation
7212660	7217880	blog where the marketing manager at Sony Computer Entertainment America talked through a tutorial
7217880	7224300	how you can record voices in the game and assign them to characters. Oh my gosh that
7224300	7228780	looks awesome. I can't play the whole video here because there's a lot to it but uh, yeah
7228780	7233700	apparently there's these whole little like pins that you can get in the game and you
7233700	7237500	can go through tutorials and one of the things you get to do, I'm trying to find where it
7237500	7241380	is in the video I probably won't get it here live on air, but you can actually record voices.
7241380	7247900	That is awesome. So we could actually do an OLR level voiced with OLR characters. That
7247900	7251700	would be kind of fun. We can be little sack boys and girls. Yes we could. We should also
7251700	7254580	get Marissa to do voice acting for us. We should definitely get Marissa to do voice
7254580	7261420	acting for us and I think she needs a sack girl that you know has very large sacks. Marissa
7261420	7268060	needs to create UTA. I love Marissa I wish I was able to see her when I was in LA. But
7268060	7272380	yeah that's awesome. I'm so looking forward to this game. You know what though? Creating
7272380	7276540	levels in LittleBigPlanet 1 was hard enough. I can't imagine how hard it's going to be
7276540	7282020	in version 2. But I'm very excited about this. I hope you guys are too. Loki will you be
7282020	7288860	doing some voice acting for a level in LittleBigPlanet? I can I guess. AlphaCananagram says this is
7288860	7293280	old news. Whatever it's new to me I'm not in the beta. I haven't been following the
7293280	7299340	news as closely as I should. Yes and Tigerclaw reminds us as well. I thought this on last
7299340	7305460	week's show but maybe not. LittleBigPlanet 2 has no 3D support. There will not be 3D
7305460	7314680	in LittleBigPlanet 2. And to that I say thank you. It is not necessary. There you go. Those
7314680	7317660	comments from chat.orangelaundry.com. It's just something that they're really pushing
7317660	7321700	but yeah you're right it's not necessary because they haven't figured out how to do it correctly
7321700	7328060	without making the gameplay suffer. Izaminar Chatroom says I think the phrase you're looking
7328060	7334100	for is heavy baggage. Thank you. Alright let's go to DarkSakura with another news story.
7334100	7340180	Hey the mailbag is not that far away just so you know. DarkSakura? Sega is well they're
7340180	7348140	looking to expand back into the arcade market but not in Japan. Not in the US but in China.
7348140	7352380	But as being the second largest economy in the world, China seems like it's going to
7352380	7358220	be a prime market for video games. Especially arcade based games. And so they're actually
7358220	7365040	taking games like Outrun and Virtua Fighter and doing new versions of them in China. It
7365040	7374460	makes sense but I'm really not sure. What do you think Rob? I don't know. I mean I don't
7374460	7384220	live in that country so it's hard for me to say what kind of culture it is but I hate
7384220	7388780	that arcades are dying here and then but at the same token when was the last time I went
7388780	7392140	to one? It's been a long time. But the reason why I don't go to them is that there's not
7392140	7396540	a lot of serious arcades here anymore you know. So I think if they're doing it kind
7396540	7401180	of more seriously in Japan and China which makes sense because the internet cafe culture
7401180	7405900	it's much bigger there too than it is here. Like there aren't really internet cafes here
7405900	7411180	anymore I mean there's there's one or two especially in the Chinatowns and Koreatowns
7411180	7417980	like the biggest one I can think of is in Koreatown in LA. But cyber cafes to us are
7417980	7422740	like Starbucks where you bring your laptop and use the Wi-Fi. Yeah that's what I was
7422740	7429620	like and there's so many neat cafes like especially in Japan I want to go to the cat cafes. But
7429620	7436140	I think it's to encourage a more social aspect yet still you know it offers a service with
7436140	7440300	it. Some of those social games were the best though and it is kind of a bummer that Xbox
7440300	7446240	Live sort of took that and made it not needing to go to your arcade. Like the best example
7446240	7450140	I can think of is when Soul Calibur 2 was in the arcades and it had that mode where
7450140	7454460	you you had your own fighter and the arcade machine would start to kind of memorize how
7454460	7459660	you play and then you could fight other people to take over the kingdom and remember that
7459660	7462980	whole little mode that was awesome. Conquest mode. Yeah the conquest mode. And I remember
7462980	7466220	it wasn't in the home version. I remember we'd come up against each other's and go oh
7466220	7472320	my god that's exactly how you play. Remember? Yes. And like even one time where I was playing
7472320	7476860	I think on somebody I was finishing someone else's game and played my own. Played my own
7476860	7484020	person was like damn I'm a cheap bitch. Or remember. Ice Calique. Something near and
7484020	7488500	dear to our hearts. Remember when DDR Max 2 was in the arcades and had the community
7488500	7492820	unlocks where the more you played the faster you'd be able to unlock stuff. That was always
7492820	7497740	kind of neat I think. So. And we would keep being and figuring out which one was next
7497740	7501980	and follow the pattern. And how the pattern was working and how many points and I remember
7501980	7505700	we would be there for some of the unlocks it was like oh my god we got an unlock. We'd
7505700	7511900	take pictures and stuff. It's Santa Morete. Alright anyhow. And then Max 300 what's this
7511900	7518380	crap? The hell is this? So yeah I think it's cool. I hope maybe some of the ideas used
7518380	7523100	in China and Japan they can figure out how to make them work in the US but I'm not gonna
7523100	7527620	hold my breath cause I think the US is just a bunch of gambling for kids. These ticket
7527620	7534340	spitting machines. Anyhow. Loki do you have better news for us? Ticket spitting machines?
7534340	7541180	Yeah. No I'm afraid I don't. But you know there's a lot of those redemption machines
7541180	7547340	that they have in some of those arcades over there in China and Japan that you know dole
7547340	7554420	out DS's and stuff. But this has nothing to do with that unfortunately because it's Wii
7554420	7559020	peripheral and I'd be very disappointed to win it in one of those machines. The Wii Speak
7559020	7565220	Microphone. Yeah it came out with Animal Crossing, City Folk and they're like oh yeah you can
7565220	7570460	chat with other people and hey that's you know it's awesome technology to be able to
7570460	7573500	chat with other players when you're playing games you know something that's standard with
7573500	7579580	say the Xbox and Playstation 3 which is why we need to get rid of it. And that's sadly
7579580	7587140	what's happening. The Wii Speak peripheral is now limited at retail locations and additional
7587140	7592920	shipments I guess can be made if consumer demand increases according to Nintendo but
7592920	7601020	other than that they are no longer producing those for retail. Not to say that games won't
7601020	7606620	still support it but it's kind of sad. Especially since they don't really have any sort of like
7606620	7615220	headset options or anything like that for the Wii. I don't know.
7615220	7619140	Yeah I mean the Wii's kind of had to catch up in some ways even though Reggie doesn't
7619140	7622020	want you to think that. I mean in some ways they had to really catch up to some of the
7622020	7628540	technology at the 360 and the PS3 was doing but it didn't work in this case and I think
7628540	7632660	part of it was that they'll throw out these peripherals and Nintendo's done this a few
7632660	7636680	times they'll throw out these peripherals and then not really support them. Like there's
7636680	7641140	one or two games that support it and then that's it. Like the balance board in some
7641140	7646580	ways is a bit of anomaly. Like if it didn't have this damn good A plus game behind it
7646580	7651900	like I think the balance board would be added to the list of stuff that like Wii Speak.
7651900	7657700	But Wii Speak was for what? A game on the Wii that honestly and I hate to say this wasn't
7657700	7662600	very good because we'd seen it before. I mean if there hadn't been two other Animal Crossing
7662600	7668500	games already then the Wii version would have been awesome but that wasn't the case. So
7668500	7675660	and then what else used Wii Speak? Nothing. Nothing. So and it's not like the Wii is known
7675660	7681700	for its online gaming capabilities where Wii Speak would come into play so it was kind
7681700	7690500	of useless. So it's unfortunate. Some folks in our chat room at chat.orangelandradi.com
7690500	7697300	I'm going to say this name again and butcher it I'm sorry. Maginomicon says yeah that was
7697300	7701820	a total waste of my money and to be fair there wasn't a better offer on the PS2 a better
7701820	7706900	showing. I guess that's one way to look at it. And then AlphaCananagram in our chat room
7706900	7712100	says seriously why isn't the Wii Speak hacked already for the PC? That's a good question.
7712100	7718460	Maybe nobody cared. Because you can just plug a microphone into the PC and there you go.
7718460	7725140	Oh yeah and Maginomicon also says what about the broadband adapter for the GameCube? Oh
7725140	7730340	my god talk about a peripheral that really went wrong. That could have been an awesome
7730340	7733580	must have peripheral and the Phantasy Star game on GameCube was actually really awesome
7733580	7739380	too. Yes it was. It was Phantasy Star Online. And it's a bummer that Sega made it because
7739380	7748740	Nintendo just didn't care. Yeah. Nintendo hates Sega confirmed. Alright one other story
7748740	7754700	I have for you guys before we get to the mailbag at mailbag.orangelandradi.com. Hey! Maginomicon
7754700	7762100	says I pronounced his name right. Woohoo! Woohoo! I know I feel like I should play the
7762100	7773060	level up music. You alright over there? I was singing the level up music for you. This
7773060	7778900	is news about Game Center on the iPhone and iPod and iPad and honestly I'm kind of looking
7778900	7782820	at this going who gives a shit about Game Center but I guess some folks in the gaming
7782820	7787060	blogs are trying to say hey Apple's getting away with what Blizzard couldn't get away
7787060	7792500	with and that is using real names. Apple made an update to the terms of service on Game
7792500	7798000	Center this week saying that they will now use your real name when you send a friend
7798000	7802380	request or reply. So if you're going to add someone on Game Center you better be prepared
7802380	7807340	for them to see your real name. Now the rest of Game Center will not show the name and
7807340	7810100	if you already have people friended on Game Center they're not going to be able to see
7810100	7816460	your name. They will see your user handle and that's it. And by the way the terms of
7816460	7822580	service also say that users must not pretend to be anyone or any entity they are not. But
7822580	7827540	this is not hitting that same kind of pushback that Real ID did. Here's the thing though
7827540	7831900	and I think a point that the game blogs are missing is that there were two big problems
7831900	7838500	with Real ID that I don't see as a problem in Game Center. Number one, Blizzard was threatening
7838500	7843900	to put real names on their forums and fine don't post in the forums except for the fact
7843900	7849260	that Blizzard will direct you to their forums to report bugs and things. So it was a little
7849260	7853580	bit of a catch-22 whereas we want you to use our forums but we're going to out your real
7853580	7858940	name as a part of that. And not to get into the rant I got into several weeks ago on this
7858940	7863980	show when that was the news but let's just put this quickly. If you think it's not a
7863980	7868180	big deal to have your first and last name out there fine but keep in mind you know some
7868180	7872060	of us have had stalkers in the past and other scary things that you know make us a little
7872060	7877340	hesitant to do that. So you know even though I don't have delusions of grandeur I realize
7877340	7882060	this podcast is just this you know little podcast with a loyal fan base. You have to
7882060	7886740	remember I have been stalked before because of it and for that reason I choose not to
7886740	7890480	tell people my last name unless like I know them in real life. If you know me in real
7890480	7894500	life it's not a big deal but just because of what's happened in the past I don't like
7894500	7899000	it being out there. So I was not a fan of this at Blizzard. The other thing I was not
7899000	7905620	a fan of was the friend of friend thing because what would happen on Real ID and they took
7905620	7910220	this out but it was in there originally is that you could go onto your friends list and
7910220	7918220	see all of your friends friends first and last name. Which I sort of think I know what
7918220	7923220	they were trying to do with that but as somebody again who has stalked before because somebody
7923220	7929740	used a friend of mine to get to me. I can see where this is a potential for problem
7929740	7934040	and it made me very mad about Real ID. Now Blizzard got rid of it. They finally pulled
7934040	7937660	their head out of their butt and they decided not to do this on the forum and they turned
7937660	7941580	off the friend of friend. They still have the real names in the game and if you add
7941580	7945260	somebody to your friends list they see your real name and so forth but at this point I'm
7945260	7948660	kinda like okay well I don't add people to my friends list I don't really know so it's
7948660	7953340	really not a big deal. And that's kind of where Game Center is at and so I don't think
7953340	7957660	it's the same thing that Blizzard is doing because now Game Center is doing what Real
7957660	7963460	ID is now and nothing more and I think a big part of the reason why they're doing it is
7963460	7967060	that there were the spammers out there. People were posting on their Twitter you know add
7967060	7970380	me on Game Center friends and then they got all these spammers. I don't really know how
7970380	7975300	you spam people on Game Center but whatever it was out there it was a problem so I think
7975300	7980780	this is how Apple's trying to fix the problem. Something else to throw out there is that
7980780	7987180	when I used Ping, wow did that tank, but I was on Ping for like a day. When I signed
7987180	7992260	up for Ping I was able to use an alias. If you search for Rob Roberts on Ping you'll
7992260	7998380	find me, my radio name. So if that's the name that's being used on Game Center then I really
7998380	8002680	don't have a problem with it, that's fine. But I don't know like I'm too, I don't really
8002680	8007620	know anybody else to send a friend request to because at the end of the day Game Center
8007620	8012180	there is zero point to it. What does Game Center bring to the iPhone gaming experience?
8012180	8018580	Not a damn thing. Achievements and scoreboards. Whoopty shit. Especially for a lot of games
8018580	8024580	that you could write off very easily. These are not serious games. Whereas World of Warcraft,
8024580	8029220	that's a huge time thing for a lot of people and a very passionate experience. Whereas
8029220	8034460	I don't think people get that connected to their iPhone games. You know it's like lol,
8034460	8039420	pocket frogs. I love my pickle, you hush. Honestly I don't really play a lot of Game
8039420	8043780	Center games. Mainly it's just Open Faint stuff because there's a lot more games that
8043780	8048380	I play that have Open Faint in them. More of them are getting Game Center but I don't
8048380	8056100	really care. Yeah I have one game on Game Center and all the rest of mine are Open Faint.
8056100	8061580	So yeah, Game Center is, I don't think it's the same thing as Real ID. I think what they're
8061580	8068720	doing, I mean, because at the end of the day, WoW has a lot of passion behind it. Game Center
8068720	8075720	has a lot of, I don't care. No one cur behind it, you know? If I had to delete Game Center
8075720	8080180	at the end of the day, I wouldn't cry. But if I had to delete World of Warcraft, I'd
8080180	8085180	be very upset that Blizzard made such a dumb decision because, you know, I am, you know,
8085180	8088900	call me an addict or whatever you want, I am very invested in that game because it is
8088900	8094860	a way for me to kind of play games all along with my friends. So, there you go. Let's go
8094860	8101100	to the mailbag. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Every week you guys send us emails and we
8101100	8105940	read them. Now the mailbags have been kind of light for the last few weeks but as I understand,
8105940	8108660	the listeners have really pulled through this week, haven't they? They did and I've actually
8108660	8112580	cut out the really long ones. Aww. Sorry. Are you going to post them online or anything?
8112580	8117340	I might post them on the forum. I said there's one I would post on the forum. Okay. Um, but
8117340	8122860	I have to do that when I'm ready for two. Um, so, first email. Um, by the lady that
8122860	8127340	sent us Boobs, gamer girl. Wait, what? What? Boobs? What? Boobs? She sent a picture of
8127340	8133260	her chest and she's wearing an Eggo t-shirt and quite lovely. Lego my Eggo. Says, I just
8133260	8138340	wanted to write the show and say you guys do an awesome job. If you keep me, no, you
8138340	8143340	keep me laughing and I love it. I wanted to know if anyone is excited about the new Cataclysm
8143340	8151340	expansion or do you think it's just hype? Hey, hey. I missed part of that. What was
8151340	8156700	that? Don't get me wrong. I've been a fan of World of Warcraft as a whole for a good
8156700	8163940	while now. After all, it's my crack AKA way out of the real world for a while. Anyway,
8163940	8169740	just wanted to say again, a good job with the show. Sincerely, gamer girl. Without getting
8169740	8173100	too much into the Warcraft discussion because now I have a whole nother show for that. Let
8173100	8177100	me try to quickly answer the question. I don't think it's all hype because let's face it,
8177100	8181900	if you do something the same way for forever, especially in gaming, it starts to get really
8181900	8187500	dull. And if you look at vanilla World of Warcraft, the leveling from zero to 60 experience,
8187500	8192700	it was now five years, six years old. That's as long as a lot of game consoles last. I
8192700	8196740	mean, I realize now in this generation we're in, it's a little bit different, but even
8196740	8201680	now we're what, five years since the Xbox 360 launched? And what is...huh? Honestly,
8201680	8209380	we could use a Cataclysm in Final Fantasy 11. Granted, they had Dynamis, the uber elite
8209380	8215260	hard Cataclysm. But here's the point I'm really trying to make, is that the Xbox 360 has been
8215260	8218540	out for what, five, six years now? And what are they doing now? They didn't release a
8218540	8222180	new console because of economy and so forth. What are they doing? They're releasing Kinect.
8222180	8226420	They're trying to reinvent the old experience. Are you suggesting that the Red Rings of Death
8226420	8232700	were the Cataclysm of the Xbox? Sure. So, now you have the Cataclysm coming to World
8232700	8238060	of Warcraft as a way to kind of reinvent the game and make old stuff new again. And so
8238060	8241620	for that reason, yeah, I think it is kind of a big deal. And I think if you are passionate,
8241620	8245360	I mean, you already know right now if you're buying Cataclysm or not. And the Galen Rockets
8245360	8250340	are pretty awesome. They are. But, let's see, I'm trying to make a long story short and
8250340	8255860	it's not really working very well. But I will say this, Cataclysm World of Warcraft was
8255860	8261940	a great way for them to get World of Warcraft 2 without making it a whole new game and splitting
8261940	8266700	the player base like what happened with EverQuest and Final Fantasy in some regards. World of
8266700	8273140	Warcraft Cataclysm is WoW 2. It might not be as jarring of a change, but they went back
8273140	8278300	and redid a lot of old shit and made it prettier and just short of the character models, which
8278300	8283220	I'm sure will be in the next expansion. It's neat that Blizzard does innovate a little
8283220	8288020	bit with each expansion. It's pretty cool. So I think it's a big deal. Okay, I'm done.
8288020	8291900	Did you hear? Now, this didn't make our show roll, but did you hear that EverQuest 2 may
8291900	8298780	be doing the same thing? What do you mean same thing? Like a Cataclysm type thing? What's
8298780	8303780	the point behind it? Just trying to... Get people to play. They need to figure out a
8303780	8307500	way to cross the two worlds over, which I know would really piss the players off in
8307500	8311660	some regards, but I just feel like where they went wrong was they really split their player
8311660	8315220	base from EverQuest to people who don't want to leave EverQuest. There's got to be a way
8315220	8320180	to copy your character into EverQuest 2. Granted, I'm talking out my butt because I've never
8320180	8329020	played EverQuest or EverQuest 2. I've only watched a friend play the first one. Anyway,
8329020	8333340	my point is they made a mistake splitting the player base, but everybody got to learn
8333340	8342540	from that. Next email. Aww, this makes my heart feel warm. Rob, Jamie, and Loki. I just
8342540	8348060	wanted to say thank you. Having a couple of back episodes to listen to at work helped
8348060	8352260	me get through what has been the worst week I've had. Listening to friends I've never
8352260	8357220	met talk about and have fun doing something that they and I enjoy was a much needed bright
8357220	8361740	spot and distraction from everything. Thank you for all that you guys do, Brad. That's
8361740	8365860	our Brad from PodCulture. Well, thank you very much, Brad. I appreciate that. We had
8365860	8370980	a really nice message on our Facebook this week too. It's been a week of warm fuzzies.
8370980	8377300	Thank you so much. Must be the holidays. Next one. Hey guys, it's Molten Brown. I just wanted
8377300	8381660	to ask you for advice. I already have a Nintendo DS and I've been debating whether or not to
8381660	8386920	get a PSP for a long time. Part of me wants it for the way the system looks as well as
8386920	8391020	better graphics the system offers compared to the DS, but I don't know if it's worth
8391020	8395700	the price to pay if there aren't that many games that I will like on it. I really like
8395700	8399060	RPGs, fighting games, and games that offer a different visual or playing style than the
8399060	8404860	norm like Hotel Dusk. Does the PSP offer any good games that fit what I like? Also, I was
8404860	8408460	wondering if the PSP is more comfortable to hold than the DS. I find that my hands start
8408460	8412300	hurting after holding the DS for more than an hour. Thanks for the advice, Molten Brown.
8412300	8415740	This email is brought to you by the Netherlands. Do you like the dreary weather and temperature
8415740	8423580	akin to fall on the East Coast? Then the Netherlands is the place for you. Um, Patapon? Patapon's
8423580	8428500	cute. Roko Roko? Yeah, those are all cute games. If you like RPGs and fighting games,
8428500	8434180	you need that Square Enix game. The fighting one that's Final Fantasy. Dissidia. Yes, Dissidia.
8434180	8438100	That should be like number one on your list. But if you like a standard fighting game,
8438100	8444020	the Tekken games on PSP are pretty nice. There's a Soulcalibur game out there, I believe. Yeah.
8444020	8450660	There's also, as far as RPGs, Puppet Lacrosse was cool. I loved it. I played through it.
8450660	8454860	And the Final Fantasy remakes are awesome, if you can find them. Yeah. But, but don't
8454860	8463940	get the go. Yeah, don't get the go. Honestly, the go, the go needs to go. The, the... It's
8463940	8470300	not worth the money. But, um, as for hand comfort, given that I have hand problems after
8470300	8479300	my surgery, uh, the PSP really is fairly comfortable, just because of the curved ends on it. But,
8479300	8485180	it, it's still reaching around for those buttons, and I have these little short thumbs. It's
8485180	8489820	really about the same, in my opinion. Don't you think, Rob? It's about the same feel?
8489820	8494380	I'm sorry, I missed... Comfort of the con, of the console itself. Uh huh. Do you think
8494380	8501380	that the PSP or the DS is more comfortable? Or are they about the same? I, I like the
8501380	8506260	feel of the PSP, because it feels like I'm holding a controller that has a, a, a video
8506260	8510140	on it. And so, you know, I have kind of, you know, I'm, I'm six foot two, so I have kind
8510140	8515100	of big hands. So, I don't know, it's, the PSP's not really a problem for me. The DS,
8515100	8519700	um, it doesn't feel the same to me, because you're using one hand to kind of write. I
8519700	8524140	think I actually, to be honest, I like the way the PSP feels a little better, I think.
8524140	8528180	I don't like, that's why I don't like DS games that overuse the stylus. Once in a while's
8528180	8534220	okay. But if I'm playing a DS game that now is stylus-free and uses the controller, then
8534220	8541060	it's cool. I'm, I'm, I'm cool with it. But the square feeling is a little weird. So I,
8541060	8545900	I think I actually like the PSP better overall, I gotta admit. Well, just a few more, because
8545900	8552380	we really did get a lot of email. Hello, OLR. Another word from Belgium here. My girlfriend
8552380	8556500	bought Kinect for my birthday last week. What an amazing piece of technology. For the first
8556500	8560220	time ever in six years, my girlfriend enjoys gaming. Yeah, she played other games, but
8560220	8564060	found them too complicated because of all the buttons you need to use. Now she even
8564060	8568500	asks to game. Truly, this must be heaven. She tested Wii and moved too, but was not
8568500	8573500	very interested in it. She thinks both are too limited to control different genres of
8573500	8578940	game. Hell, even my father played bowling and Kinect, and he didn't suck at it. Anyways,
8578940	8583620	as I stated, Kinect is amazing. Everything Microsoft promised works perfectly. The major
8583620	8587980	drawback is the space it needs, though my room is too small to play, to decently play
8587980	8592740	Kinect. So I have to move my 360 and Kinect to the living room. But that's not my biggest
8592740	8598140	problem. What I was thinking of is this. I fear Microsoft might reveal a Kinect 2 or
8598140	8605380	Kinect HD next to E3. It will not need as much space as Kinect needs. Do you think Microsoft
8605380	8610540	will announce this early? Do we need to shell out another 150 euros next Christmas? Or will
8610540	8615500	they do no such thing and hold onto the spacious Kinect? I don't think the space needed can
8615500	8619860	be fixed with a firmware update. I would like to thank you for OLR. You guys really make
8619860	8624480	my day. Yours truly, Fabrice. Honestly, you know, I think the third party company is going
8624480	8630240	to come out with a solution to this. I think it's actually a lot simpler than it sounds,
8630240	8636260	but literally snapping on a lens to the front of that would probably fix that right there.
8636260	8641300	Yeah, and your other question about will they announce something new at E3? No. No way.
8641300	8645780	Not this soon. This E3 is going to be about now. What is the next wave of games for Kinect?
8645780	8650340	I think what Microsoft really needs to do at this year's E3, and the publishers, is
8650340	8656680	show us, okay, now we've seen you taking the Wii games and taking them to the next step.
8656680	8659340	What are the Kinect games really about now? What are you really going to do with this
8659340	8664540	thing? I think that's what this next E3 is about, and what Microsoft has to show. I don't
8664540	8673820	see them at all doing a Kinect 2.0. No, not this quick. Maybe a smaller one, like a slim
8673820	8678660	remodel type of thing. The budget Kinect. Again, I think it's too soon. Now, maybe a
8678660	8685300	price cut for the existing Kinect, that could come out at E3, but I don't see, especially
8685300	8689340	this quick. I mean, you're talking like a little over six months after the launch. Not
8689340	8696100	going to happen that fast. Now, as far as the next console goes, if Kinect proves popular,
8696100	8701700	which so far it is, I would expect that when we get to the Xbox 720 or whatever we call
8701700	8708220	it, Kinect will be built in to whatever it is they have planned next. But that whole
8708220	8715700	whatever's next is still a good two years out, at least. At least. It's going to come
8715700	8720740	a lot sooner from Nintendo than it is the other two. You know, Sony has said time and
8720740	8724580	time again, ten year cycle, ten year cycle, ten year cycle. The only one that needs to
8724580	8729980	catch up right now is Nintendo. And in some ways, they don't, because they're still selling
8729980	8733780	like crazy, because they're kind of the budget system at this point. But I see them going
8733780	8738300	more of the route like they do with the DS and the Game Boys and all that stuff, where
8738300	8743220	it's something that, it's an upgrade, but it still plays all the old stuff. Yep. I absolutely
8743220	8749920	100% think whatever we see next from Nintendo is going to be Wii Evolved. Not throwing out
8749920	8753420	the whole Wii concept altogether. The Wii's been a huge seller. It's going to be Wii HD.
8753420	8758660	It'll be Wiivolved. Wiivolve. Actually, that'll be the name of the console right there. Trademark
8758660	8764820	Dark Sakura. That's right. Trademark. Copyright. Patent pending. Blah, blah, blah. Restricted.com.
8764820	8774020	Boobs. Nice. So, uh, next, and I'm only going to do two more. We really did get a lot. Greetings
8774020	8778640	Orange Orange Radio. The first thing, I believe you're all mega excited to see Tron Legacy
8778640	8783560	in about two weeks. Well, I've been seeing this ad on Facebook, and well, let me pull
8783560	8793860	up the ad. It's a big flashy Tron Legacy thing. Dude, that looks like it's going to load the
8793860	8800380	old arcade game or something. Flash. I'm trying to see. Light Cycles! I bet that's like a
8800380	8805180	Light Cycle arcade game on Facebook or something, huh? Upload your face. Get on the grid. Oh,
8805180	8811020	so you can take a picture of your face and put it in this trailer. Oh, that's cute. That's
8811020	8817220	like those dancing elves that I see around work every year. I hate the freaking dancing
8817220	8823300	elves. The Jib Jab. That's what it's called. I'm going to post this in the chatroom. It's
8823300	8828300	basically a face mapping app. If you click on it, you may have to take a picture of your
8828300	8832940	face. Note, I said face because it didn't recognize anything else. And know that didn't
8832940	8838140	mean I took a picture of my balls. I used my- What if you draw a smiley face on your
8838140	8845140	penis? I used my Moby Noggy screenshot of my character. And you get to watch yourself
8845140	8851220	get killed by Jeff Bridges. Just thought you'd think it was cool. Second, if I were to start
8851220	8854340	World of Warcraft on the original expansion, would I just be locked out of the places or
8854340	8859500	should I get Cataclysm and start there? Here's the thing. Cataclysm won't work without the
8859500	8865300	regular game. I'm getting a lot of wow questions. Hoardhousepodcast.gmail.com. Just saying. Don't
8865300	8868180	you have to have all the other expansions? You do. You do. But here's the thing, and
8868180	8871700	a lot of people are missing this. When they released the Cataclysm, when they released
8871700	8877940	the Kraken, or Deathwing in this case, they evolved Old World permanently. So if you have
8877940	8882500	World of Warcraft and nothing but, if you have Vanilla WoW, you will still get the new
8882500	8889900	WoW experience. The Old World is gone. So it makes it a really good experience. There
8889900	8894540	are other enhancements that make the Cataclysm worth purchasing, such as- But is Mr. T still
8894540	8899780	there? I believe he is. He's not outside the cities anymore, but he'll come back. Such
8899780	8904460	as, and just a short list, the ability to level to 85. New dungeons and raids that come
8904460	8909620	with that. The fact that you can roll a Worgen or a Goblin, and Worgen is going to be a huge
8909620	8918900	race. I mean there's tons of furries that want to play Worgen. I'm half tempted if somebody
8918900	8923240	gets me the game to put Star Trek Online aside to give it a try. Well there's one other thing
8923240	8927320	I want to throw out there, and that is, now is an excellent time to suck yourself back
8927320	8931420	into the World of Warcraft, because Blizzard's been having this huge sale, and I don't know
8931420	8938060	if it's over yet or not, but Vanilla WoW, five bucks. Burning Crusade, five bucks. Wrath,
8938060	8942860	ten bucks. Twenty bucks gets you caught up to- They even had one. I already had the other
8942860	8946260	two, the first two. I'm not sure if it was going on during the sale though, or whatever.
8946260	8950420	It was, you buy it at GameStop for fifteen dollars, you get a fifteen dollar gift card.
8950420	8955420	You get it for free, basically. Nice. Let me see if that sale is still going on. Dark
8955420	8960060	Saga, if that sale is still going on, I will buy you Wrath of the Lich King as a Hanukkah
8960060	8968860	present. Okay. I'll give it a try again, I mean, shit. As much as I love Star Trek Online,
8968860	8976180	I can alternate months. Excellent. Except I don't want to have to go out and buy Cataclysm.
8976180	8981140	I on the other hand will not be joining the World of Warcraft. If you don't have an intro-
8981140	8986860	I'm not even going to try with you, you have a baby anyway. I don't join even the actual
8986860	8991300	world right now, so. I was just going to say, as long as you don't want to roll a Worgen
8991300	8995860	or a Goblin, there's not a lot for you until you get up to level 80. I still have- I have
8995860	9003760	a level 20, um, what the fuck are the goat people, Rob? Draenei. Draenei. I have a Russian
9003760	9009140	goat people. Not enough rage. Alright, anyhow, Jovidaya on our channel says, all I hear
9009140	9015260	is blah blah wow, blah blah vanilla, blah blah blah. Puppies, rainbows, kittens, unicorns.
9015260	9024540	Do I have your attention now? Naked men. Choaniki. Choaniki. No, um, I'm going to go finish.
9024540	9030640	Okay, third- Majinamicon and other big words I can think of. Alright, um, okay third, can
9030640	9035740	you patch a UMD or download PSP import games to English? Because I know that you can do
9035740	9040660	that for the DS, so I was wondering. Um, I'm sure within emulator? I don't know if there's
9040660	9045820	people that do that, but maybe. It wouldn't be on UMD anymore. You would have to have
9045820	9050980	this whole ROM thing and then you're getting into shady hacks. So I'm sure it's possible.
9050980	9056660	Don't ever doubt what the hacker community can do, but it just- you'd have to go to the
9056660	9062520	darker parts of the internet to find it. Okay, one last thing, DarkSakurai, in Comic
9062520	9066860	Insanity do you guys talk about anime as well? Typically not unless they have a comic attached
9066860	9074860	to them and not necessarily manga. We really focus on Marvel, you know, DC, IDW, Udon,
9074860	9079700	basically US-based companies, so. Although we've gone into a little bit of the manga
9079700	9083700	before. I think it's one of those, like, inevitables. Like, you know food is going to come up on
9083700	9088860	OLR and you know that manga's gotta come up on Comic Insanity once in a while. And, uh,
9088860	9093020	He Who Shall Not Be Named on Comic Insanity. And just like, and X-to-Fur's Masturbation
9093020	9097300	Habits will come up on Horde House. Just saying. Yes. It says, thank you, and DarkSakurai,
9097300	9100140	your grammar coaching is appreciated. Well, if you really appreciated it, you would've
9100140	9105620	spelled grammar right. Nice. Let me get some comments from chat. Chat.orangessauceredo.com.
9105620	9111380	I love this comment. SSG100Matt says, so Jamie went from World of War crap to I might consider
9111380	9115380	playing it over the course of an episode. I might consider playing it if someone else
9115380	9119340	buys it for me. This is the awesome thing about Orange Launch Radio. Hey look, last
9119340	9125740	week we went from guy tweeting us saying isn't this game cool to having the creator on our
9125740	9131340	show hours ago. Every gamer has a voice. I love this show. It's amazing. Uh, DDRDollarBill
9131340	9137780	in the chat says, shit, I'm still jonesing for DC Universe to try it out. It's awesome.
9137780	9143420	It needs work, but it's awesome. Remember, this is, if someone buys it for me, I would
9143420	9149780	play it. Fair enough. And that means I'd have to give up Star Trek Online for a month. And
9149780	9153900	I don't want to be kicked out of my fleet. So I still have to think about it. SalaciousPop
9153900	9158900	in our chat room says, a UMD rip, which I've used, is like 500 to 900 megabytes. That's
9158900	9165380	an awful lot to patch. Also, most torrented PSP games are just disk images, hence UMD
9165380	9171460	rip. Text patches actually modify game files. I would have thought, though, because you
9171460	9176420	can do it so easily with, you know, like Super Nintendo ROMs and stuff. But then again, what,
9176420	9181780	the largest Super Nintendo images are what, 1632 megs? So I can see where it's probably
9181780	9188260	a much bigger pain in the ass. But again, don't doubt the hacker community. Where there's
9188260	9194740	a will, there's a way. Right? Indeed. Any more emails tonight? Oh, they're still reading
9194740	9200540	this email. Oh, my bad. Um, thanks for reading my email. And if you didn't, what the fuck?
9200540	9206500	Also, Darsakha, fuck my life. And why would you let Rob lick Dan's balls just to mess
9206500	9212660	with you? Remember, Dan made balls last week. We were eating. Did you forget about your
9212660	9218300	husband's balls? No, it's just now they're ground beef. Oh. Your loyal listener, Haseo
9218300	9222980	Sumiragawa. P.S. Can I get a woot from the Minnesota listeners? Because Garrett Hedlund,
9222980	9228100	aka Sam Flynn, was born in Rosso, Minnesota, about 100 miles from where I live and pissing
9228100	9233500	distance from Canada. Canadian! Tron Legacy officially made of win. All right, let's get
9233500	9240000	a woot from the Minnesota listeners. Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. I'm sure they're out
9240000	9246540	there somewhere. Well, we have one last email. All right. And this one, I, you know, it's,
9246540	9250700	okay. I'm just trying to keep away from the political, in charge stuff, but this is a
9250700	9255900	good email. With all the homophobia, don't ask, don't tell, Prop 8, among others, why
9255900	9260780	does it matter if anyone is gay or not? The way people worry about being gay or being
9260780	9265140	near someone gay, I can't help but make the comparison to the X-Men movie and fear people
9265140	9271100	had towards mutants. That's where mutants came from, kind of. All the arguments against
9271100	9275340	gay marriage, gays in the military, gay teachers, to me, are unfounded and stupid, and the more
9275340	9279820	they try to defend their position, by the way, they are spelled T-H-E-I-R, not T-H-E-R-E,
9279820	9285260	but position, the more stupid and ignorant they get. Agreed. Except for your spelling.
9285260	9289820	I hope one day it just won't matter, there's an apostrophe and won't, and everyone is treated
9289820	9296420	the same. I wrote this email after talking this very subject with my wife several times.
9296420	9301260	I just can't figure out why it matters if everyday life, in everyday life, if one is
9301260	9307260	gay or not. What people do in the privacy of their own homes is their own business,
9307260	9310780	and why should it dictate if you can do a job to defend our country or get married?
9310780	9315420	Sorry for the email, I'm not gay-related, but I just wanted your opinion on this again.
9315420	9320340	And there's a gay-related part, so I'll read that next. I agree with everything. So, you
9320340	9329020	missed it earlier, I had my FKHH shirt. Yeah, I mean, what you're saying, I think, is the,
9329020	9333900	I don't want to say the right viewpoint, but in a way it's kind of like, in a perfect world,
9333900	9338580	where hopefully in the world our children and our grandchildren live in, you're right,
9338580	9346180	it won't be a big deal. It's just whatever, no one curr. But I think right now, I think
9346180	9351140	sometimes, you know, because there's two extremes to this. There isn't necessarily just the
9351140	9356180	homophobic side, but then there is the side that likes to drag people out of the closet,
9356180	9361540	so to speak, which I'm not necessarily sure I agree with either. Because there's people
9361540	9366660	that don't want it to be that big of a factor, that would prefer not to say that they're
9366660	9371380	quote in the closet, but that they just don't make it, they don't, for whatever reason,
9371380	9374920	want to make it a huge part of their life. I think that one's life shouldn't necessarily
9374920	9381100	be dictated by their sexuality. Yeah, absolutely. It's an aspect of the life, but it's not your
9381100	9390220	entire life. I don't go around thinking about, oh, I'm going to fuck Dan every day. Sorry.
9390220	9399180	I just like that. Is that what your inner voice sounds like? I'm gonna fuck Dan. No.
9399180	9407820	I've been using the redneck voice for Pinkberry too. I'm going Pinkberry. Nice. But no, I'm
9407820	9415580	just saying, you know, it's like, I'm going to be, I'm going to, you know, oh, I eat only
9415580	9421820	tacos so I'm only going to do things associated with tacos. You know what I mean? Right. It's
9421820	9429060	like, okay, you know, if you prefer to sit on the toilet or pee, you know, if you prefer
9429060	9436740	to pee standing up or sitting down, guys, is that determine your life? You know what
9436740	9442740	I mean though? I'm picking something that, cause some guys prefer to pee sitting down,
9442740	9448100	some guys prefer it standing up. When did you choose to pee sitting down? When did you
9448100	9453500	choose to pee standing up? When did you choose to be gay? When did you choose to be straight?
9453500	9461100	It doesn't matter. Hey, hey, hey, Matt, when did you choose to be straight? Boobies. I
9461100	9470180	don't know. When did I choose? I don't think I did choose. Exactly. Point. But Matt's also
9470180	9475100	on the side of reasonableness. Matt is where the rest of America needs to be. You know
9475100	9480780	what I mean? And generally our listenership I think is on that same page. That is promising
9480780	9485420	more than anything. You know, obviously it's no secret on the show. I'm gay. Although,
9485420	9490240	Oh my God. But well for the longest time, you know, uh, especially when the show was
9490240	9495940	first podcast, when it first came out on the show that I was gay, there was quite a few
9495940	9500380	emails about the whole like, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait. Rob's gay. Like, because
9500380	9505140	if you remember, well, hold on though. Remember for the longest time we were doing a live
9505140	9509140	show and then a separate podcast. So there were a lot of people that were listening to
9509140	9513900	the podcast that weren't listening to live show where like the, the other talk was happening.
9513900	9519140	Whereas on the podcast until we combine the shows, then it finally came out probably,
9519140	9522540	you know, like a year and a half after we've been podcasting. And you know, I'd mentioned
9522540	9525940	some guy had been dating or whatever and you know, there was, there was quite a few emails
9525940	9533220	that came in that next week. Okay. So I don't remember getting any thing bad. Uh, I got
9533220	9537820	one that was a little iffy, like I don't, it wasn't necessarily negative, but it was
9537820	9542820	more of like an I'll pray for you thing. And it was kind of one of those, you know, okay,
9542820	9549220	thanks but no need. You know, I know that if there's a higher power, I try to live my
9549220	9555680	life to the best of moral being that I can and what higher power that is nothing but
9555680	9560020	love is going to send me straight to hell to burn for an eternity for trying to be the
9560020	9566660	best person I can be. That's a ridiculous way of thinking. Exactly. It's, you know,
9566660	9576860	this is the whole way I look at it. It's like, you know, it's, I'm trying to think lifestyle
9576860	9582380	is like going out to the clubs and dyeing your hair blue or you know, if you want to
9582380	9589660	be seen or, or you know, lifestyle is how you live your life, what you've chosen to
9589660	9596980	do with your life. But that's not lifestyle. That's just an aspect. It may contribute to
9596980	9602700	your lifestyle, but it's not something that you choose to do. You know what I mean? I'm
9602700	9605460	trying to make sense with this. It's not something. I don't mean to laugh at you. I'm laughing
9605460	9609940	at chat because you know, Alan said something funny, so I'll read it in a minute. But it's,
9609940	9615820	it's just like, it really shouldn't have to do with anything. It shouldn't be a big deal.
9615820	9621820	It shouldn't be anybody else's freaking business. Uh, let's see. Salacious Pop in our chat room
9621820	9627340	says, quote, I will inform Jesus ASAP of your wrongdoing so that he may send his Healy vagina
9627340	9631860	beams at you so that you can go to heaven because I'm concerned about you so much. Look,
9631860	9635500	and I don't mean to mock religion. I think there's a lot of good stuff that can come
9635500	9640540	out of religion, but unfortunately there's also a lot of bad stuff that can come out.
9640540	9643580	You know what I mean though? You know what I mean? I never want to disrespect somebody's
9643580	9649980	religion until that religion disrespects me. Right? Well, and I'm going to plug this once
9649980	9653300	on the show because I think that everyone who listens to it actually get a lot of good
9653300	9657460	out of this. There's um, and I follow him on Facebook and I've actually plugged the
9657460	9664060	podcast. The guy's name is John Shore. He's an evangelical Christian. He did a movie called
9664060	9670420	Lord save us from your followers. And the whole movie is basically him actually going
9670420	9674700	out and striking up conversations with people to find out why they don't like Christians,
9674700	9679060	why they have a problem with evangelicals, you know, actually just going in and asking
9679060	9687700	questions. And you know, meeting, he went to San Francisco to Castro to talk to people.
9687700	9692220	Quite a few fabulous drag queens on there too. But I mean the whole, the whole point
9692220	9700420	is that it's like you need to stop being right and start respecting other people. It's, you
9700420	9705820	know, that close minded, Oh, this is the only way it can be. Maybe it's because the Bible
9705820	9709660	said this or maybe my pastor said this. This is the only way it is and all the rest of
9709660	9714260	you are wrong. That is no way that's going to automatically close the door on anything
9714260	9718940	you have to say. Excellent point. One other thing I want to say on this and I swear we
9718940	9723620	can get back to games, but um, you know, whatever we're, we're allowed to get on off topic grants
9723620	9728460	once in a while because I clearly don't ask, don't tell on the whole hubba loo about that
9728460	9731800	right now in America motivated this email. Like, yeah, I think there was a party said
9731800	9736180	talking about to the wife about serving and all that. So clearly there was some motivation
9736180	9741860	by that whole hot topic. And the thing that gets me and the just, just the idiot perspective
9741860	9747460	and the people that have the biggest problem, I think sometimes with homosexuality and even
9747460	9751660	so much what they're saying, the problem is with don't ask or, or the, or why they need
9751660	9758340	don't ask, don't tell is that straight men or certain straight men are threatened because
9758340	9763900	they don't want guys checking them out. They don't want other guys checking them out. And
9763900	9770940	there's a part of me that goes, A, get over yourself. Do you know, uh, there's probably
9770940	9776460	a lot of people that don't care less just because someone's gay. I don't find every
9776460	9781300	guy in the world hot just because I happen to be gay. In fact, there's, there's quite
9781300	9789140	a few ugly ones out there. I hate to say it. Uh, but you just, when people kind of have
9789140	9793100	that perspective of like, well, I hope he's not gay cause I'm not, he's going to try to
9793100	9797580	put in my butt. I'm just, I just think like you're the one with issues if that's your
9797580	9803740	line of thinking, like why is that such a big deal to you? Why does that, I mean what
9803740	9807960	ultimately boils down to a compliment, right? When somebody likes you, that's a compliment.
9807960	9815300	Why does that make you so freaky? Are they so scared? What was the word? Are they so
9815300	9820420	insecure? Yeah, insecure. That's the perfect word. Well, and you know, it's, it's actually
9820420	9827620	a proven psychological point that a lot of people, not everybody, do have some homosexual
9827620	9834620	tendencies. There can be a level of attraction. You may not fully, I guess, swing that way
9834620	9838400	to use the quote, but it has been proven. There's studies out there that everyone carries
9838400	9842300	a little bit. I mean, if, if not for you, I mean, and I've said, I don't know that I've
9842300	9846380	made this completely, but I've talked to you about it before, but I mean, if not for Dan,
9846380	9854100	I could easily have had a girlfriend. I've had flings, you know, I, I have, I'm completely
9854100	9861420	attracted to everybody I guess, you know. Um, but it's not like I'm going to go up to
9861420	9868420	someone and go boobies. Really? Cause I think you did that once and you were drunk. I did.
9868420	9873020	Just kidding. I will say one and I've told you this off the air before, but it did kind
9873020	9882420	of gross me out when I saw you kiss a girl. That's so wrong. But I have, you were drunk.
9882420	9891060	I have kissed women. Yeah. Big deal. But it was dumb fun. It was, I'm not saying it grossed
9891060	9895060	me out. I'm just like, that's so weird. I know. I know. It was funny. But yeah, back
9895060	9900020	to the point. Yeah, it's, it's, it's interesting. But what, there was one other thing I want
9900020	9904400	to say about this. Oh, oh, here's the thing. If you're that guy that's really afraid of
9904400	9909200	another guy hitting on you or whatever, let me, here's a simple line to use. If, if somebody
9909200	9913700	ever reveals to you their secret man crush on you, brings you on the, on the local talk
9913700	9919940	show to out their crush or whatever on you. Thanks, but no thanks. I'll tell you what,
9919940	9923180	straight people have been using that line for a long time. Gay people use that line
9923180	9929260	with each other too. Thanks, but no thanks. Right? Yeah. If somebody says they have a
9929260	9933380	crush on you, but you know, you, you just don't feel that same way or, or you happen
9933380	9936940	to already be in a relationship or married or something, no matter what the two genders
9936940	9941780	are. Thanks, but no thanks. It was like, remember great America when I went to gay day at great
9941780	9948900	America and the girl was in the bathroom and said I was cute. I was like, Oh, thank you.
9948900	9954340	I'm taken. It was that easy. I mean, I wasn't expecting it. You came out of there and you
9954340	9959940	were like, Oh, Hey, I'm looking hot today. Well, you were there. You saw, I was tickled
9959940	9965900	all day. I was like, she thought I was nice to get a compliment. I know it's not, I mean,
9965900	9970140	I was like, that's so cool. I mean, there wouldn't be a single person in this universe
9970140	9975180	I would cheat on, you know, while I'm with Dan, I would never. What about Margaret Cho
9975180	9982500	circa 10 years ago? Nah. All right. I, you know, I am completely and utterly dedicated
9982500	9989820	to my husband. You are completely and utterly dedicated to Alan and Matt here is completely
9989820	10000860	and utterly dedicated to his phone right now. That's correct. You clearly love your wife
10000860	10009340	very much. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. But I'm saying, you know, all of us in this room,
10009340	10016740	we have found our person. We were very happy people. You know, it's we, we have that level
10016740	10020780	of security that even if we weren't with our significant others that we'd just say, you
10020780	10027460	know, thanks, but no. All right. I want to say this in the chat because this is so good.
10027460	10032620	Brad says, if someone is checking you out, be flattered. Now, if they stalk you different
10032620	10036520	story. Absolutely right. And it doesn't matter what the genders are in that case too, because
10036520	10041380	that stalking is when it crosses the line when thanks, no thanks. Doesn't get the message
10041380	10048380	across like it should to most reasonable people. That's a whole nother problem. And that is
10048380	10055040	free of whatever sexuality happens to be the case. Yes. Stocking is never cool. So if someone
10055040	10063020	tells you thanks, but no thanks, try, try for a friendship or go fishing again. I've
10063020	10066340	had times where the first time I've been like, no, I'm not really insured. They came back
10066340	10070460	a week later and said, you know what? I'm, I'm, I still would really like try. Will you
10070460	10074660	give me a chance? I'm going to be okay. You know? All right. I'll give you a chance. The
10074660	10082180	third time. No, that's creepy. I I'm, I'm kind of okay with the second try, but after
10082180	10089380	that, no. Oh my God. There was this one time I'm getting texted. Oh, nevermind. We're going
10089380	10094340	to print tomorrow for the American overview. So what time the print is. So, but it's like
10094340	10100220	when I was working at Aladdin's castle in Mobile, Alabama, this guy comes in and he's
10100220	10109700	like, Hey, you're cute. I'll go out with you. I'll be here to pick you up when you off work.
10109700	10116540	And I was like, I am taking, this is right when Dan and I were first, you know, considering
10116540	10120940	each other, but I was like, dude, I'm not interested. I was like, thank you, but no,
10120940	10124700	I'm not interested. I'm going to be here. Well, I'll have you know that our security
10124700	10133100	guard is an ex army ranger and I'll be calling him to be here. So the guy didn't show up,
10133100	10139780	but I'm saying, but I'm saying, you know, you've got to be confident in yourself and
10139780	10145420	take it as a compliment. If someone is checking you out, go, yeah, huh? In your head. And
10145420	10149620	you know, if you're not interested with them, go, no, thank you. If they're not loony and
10149620	10155640	crazy and you know, bizarre and shocking, then they'll go, well, okay. Make sad face
10155640	10160300	puppy eyes at you and then go pout. But if again, just to try and bring closer to this,
10160300	10163900	if you're one of those guys or, or girls or whatever, that's I want someone of the same
10163900	10168140	gender checking me out, then you know what? Your attitude is probably not attractive and
10168140	10173500	no one is probably checking you out. Just food for thought. Well, the game part of the
10173500	10177260	email. Okay. Game related stuff. Earth Defense Force is one of my favorite games and can't
10177260	10182620	wait for Earth Defense Force to hope it is online co-op. Great ship. It is online co-op
10182620	10188660	three player ratio. Keep up the great work and honestly, and the honesty you have toward
10188660	10194740	life and gaming. Oh, that's a compliment. The honesty we have towards life and gaming.
10194740	10199460	This has been a week of warm fuzzies for as far as like compliments go and so forth. And
10199460	10204180	I realize it's not been a warm fuzzy week for everybody out there in the world. Uh,
10204180	10207760	what with just God, the economy in general. And it seems like we always have these stories
10207760	10212340	about closures and you know, other things. It makes me feel tingly, but it's, it's, it
10212340	10216820	does feel nice to get paid a compliment. We've been paid several this week and totally unsolicited.
10216820	10222300	I would like my next compliment in the form of money. Stop. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
10222300	10227420	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Any other emails tonight? Too many. I I'm done. Well,
10227420	10230540	sorry to those didn't get through. You just unfortunately just picked the wrong week.
10230540	10235940	I guess male bag of orange on trader.com. Try again. We'll get to you at some point.
10235940	10239100	All right. This is the part of the show where we do the FUs of the week. I know it sounds
10239100	10241980	weird. I just talked about like, Oh, what a warm fuzzy week. And I'm like, all right,
10241980	10266820	time to rant. But here we go. You all right over there? I'm fine. Um, F you to, uh, you
10266820	10272980	know, not that recording podcasts all day was that bad, but F you to how tired I feel
10272980	10278580	after all that and how my throat hurts. But it's big. Thank you to Tiara for editing the
10278580	10286060	first podcast for me. Thank you. So yeah, mine's kind of warm and fuzzy too. Not cold
10286060	10296900	and sandpapery. I'm done. Loki, uh, if he this stupid overclock program, cause he only
10296900	10302220	knows how to underclock and that's not what I want. Uh, my view of the week goes to traffic
10302220	10306420	and people that don't know how to drive in the rain. My God, some of you California people
10306420	10310260	are so spoiled. Like the rain here is nothing and just, it rains and people know what they're
10310260	10316820	doing. So F you to that. And then F you to the fact that I just, I have a very, very
10316820	10325020	busy week and weeks ahead and not necessarily bad, but yeah, F you to the fact that I can't
10325020	10332220	just sit on my ass and be lazy all day. Some days that's what I want to do. All right.
10332220	10336140	Anyhow, let's move on to a couple more stories and we're going to open up the Skyline one
10336140	10342780	eight seven seven game O L R but not just yet. Don't say that to the chatters. No, not
10342780	10347780	the chatters. No, it's having to be the print preview at eight 45 in the morning, which
10347780	10352820	I guess is better than six in the morning. Oh, you have to get up early tomorrow. Fucking
10352820	10360220	a lame. All right. How about some more stories? I'm looking forward to going Loki. All right.
10360220	10373260	Um, so this is neat. Uh, actually the Michael Jackson game. Now I'm not necessarily one
10373260	10377540	going to get it on the DS, maybe the Wii, maybe the connect and stuff when that comes
10377540	10382540	out because it's supposed to be just like just dance. But uh, for the DS of course there's,
10382540	10389180	they've done some very specific things. If you try to say pirate the ROM, um, this is
10389180	10392580	kind of neat and I know Jamie will get kicked out of this. Uh, one of the things that they
10392580	10399140	do first off is they have a vuvuzela, uh, playing on top of all the songs during the
10399140	10405420	game. And then of course they render the games touch screen, um, nonfunctional. So you don't
10405420	10410940	get to play the game and you don't get to listen to the music untainted by the vuvuzela.
10410940	10415680	So that's good. I love it. I want to do that just for the vuvuzela. I have to admit as
10415680	10419980	much as I hate it when she breaks it out on the show. I think that is a really funny anti-piracy
10419980	10423580	measure. And I think more companies, you know, if they want to fight, fight piracy, they
10423580	10433500	should be doing it this way. Actually, actually I will have, have you know this. Uh, I actually
10433500	10437940	played a real vuvuzela this week. Uh, one of my friends was having a birthday party
10437940	10442380	and one of the other friends that came to the party brought a vuvuzela with her. And
10442380	10446660	so, uh, I played it and it took me a minute to figure out how to play it. Like the first
10446660	10452380	couple of times I was doing it, it just kind of sounded like a really loud, wet fart. But
10452380	10457180	once I was able to get it, it was kind of fun. So there you go. What are you taking
10457180	10462060	pictures of me for? What's this for? Are you gonna take my soul? All right. She's stealing
10462060	10470180	your soul. Your soul is hers. Dead air. I don't know what she's doing. I downloaded
10470180	10475500	an iPhone app that's like fat booth program. Cause I'm going to be, no, it isn't. It does
10475500	10485820	gal style here. I'm going to put that on the website. Yes. I think, I think then I should
10485820	10494780	get to do the unicorn pick of you. All right. I'll do the unicorn picture here in a minute.
10494780	10497820	Tiger claw in our chat says, I'm Rob. That isn't one of them. Mozilla sounds like a wet
10497820	10504060	fart. I know I was playing it wrong. I told you. All right. A better hairstyle. One more
10504060	10507500	story for you guys. And then I got to take the picture of the unicorn. So look, he's
10507500	10510980	going to have to take the calls tonight. All right. Anyhow, this is a game. And I don't,
10510980	10521260	I don't even know what to think of this. Um, it's a game called cock out and it's a, you
10521260	10526860	need a minute. All right. It's a German AIDS awareness organization who released this game.
10526860	10531780	It's called cock out, uh, and where players will actually slip on a motion sensing digital
10531780	10539080	condom and use their thrust to pummel a virtual HIV. Really? This is for real. This has gotta
10539080	10542820	be a joke, right? Commercial is hilarious. Well, there's an actual commercial out there
10542820	10547860	on the internet, uh, that has, um, booty in it. So dark soccer, did you see all this booty
10547860	10553860	in the commercial here? Yes, I did. I'm surprised you're not still giggling. And it's just basically
10553860	10558380	all these guys, uh, that look like they're whacking it. And, uh, I guess they're supposed
10558380	10562980	to be playing this game. Now, the part that gets me is that, okay, I just reported on
10562980	10567980	this and it's all over the game blogs and so forth. What's the actual game? Why are
10567980	10573240	all these guys looking like they're jerking it? Is that, that's it? Is there any type
10573240	10580700	of strategy or anything to it or any, why am I asking these questions? Of course not.
10580700	10587860	Why am I even bothering, right? Why are you taking another picture of me? All right, hurry,
10587860	10593380	hurry up. Loki, can you give the phone information while she takes this damn picture? So, uh,
10593380	10602260	to Skype us, you need 1-877-GAME-OLR and, um, do that via Skype or via the 1-800 number.
10602260	10605500	You are so great. And then, uh, on Skype, what was it? Orange Lounge Radio? Orange Lounge
10605500	10612140	Radio. Oh, we're on Skype. Or 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our, uh, Skype line is now open. Give us a
10612140	10620860	call. There you go. Loki, do you have any, uh, maybe you need one of those pictures of
10620860	10626500	Loki. Do you have any last minute stories for us, Loki? No, I'm not next. I'm sorry,
10626500	10630660	uh, you must have your mistake with somebody else. All right, I'm gonna get the Darkstalkers
10630660	10634620	unicorn picture real quick here. Uh, so, in the meantime, uh, do you have any last minute
10634620	10638660	stories while we wait for some calls? Well, I was just gonna mention how awesome, uh,
10638660	10643500	Swords in Poker 2 is on the iOS platform. Definitely need to check that out. If you
10643500	10648660	haven't already, it's a pretty awesome role-playing game and, uh, I'm not getting paid by them,
10648660	10653080	which is disappointing because I could really use extra money. I mean, who can't use extra
10653080	10657740	money? And hopefully that's bought me enough time to get into the forum to where the extra
10657740	10661180	stories are. Because I have not been looking for extra stories, I have been playing with
10661180	10671860	my phone. And, uh, of course, um, awesome. What the hell is this? Apparently there is
10671860	10678500	a NASCAR Superstar driving game that will let you race dumpsters. That's pretty funny.
10678500	10685700	Um, yeah, uh, Jimmy Johnson's Anything with an Engine is a brand new game and apparently
10685700	10690540	lives up to its name and you can race a dumpster with a rocket apparently on it. That is pretty
10690540	10696700	awesome. Um, also, I'm not sure if anyone saw this this week, uh, I'm sure a lot of
10696700	10701580	people have, the custom Tron bikes that they had out there, the light cycles, pretty awesome
10701580	10706620	except for the fact that they don't glow. They're completely unrideable. Uh, not unrideable.
10706620	10711460	They look way uncomfortable. Well. And then just like you have to push them to get them
10711460	10714700	going and you don't fall over. They should've made the new, how they have that four-wheel
10714700	10719820	vehicle that they have now. Yeah. They should've made that instead. Well, how, how the crap
10719820	10729540	do you, do you change the tire? You can't. It's a custom tire. See? Waste of money. Um,
10729540	10733900	I was gonna mention DJ Hero 2. They've got some, uh, new download content coming out
10733900	10738860	for that, which is pretty exciting. Uh, especially since it's got more Prodigy in it and one
10738860	10743900	of the songs I was hoping to make it into the game to begin with, uh, that didn't, but
10743900	10750020	now it has. Uh, Invaders Must Die mixed with, um, Debaser from the Pixies. That's kinda
10750020	10755060	cool. Uh, Beastie Boys Body Movin' mixed with, uh, Lenny Kravitz, Rock n' Roll is Dead. Of
10755060	10759380	course this stuff is already out. It came out this week. Uh, next week, actually two
10759380	10763860	weeks from now, the old school pack, they're gonna have Fat Boys with Human Beat Box mixed
10763860	10770860	with Mantronics. Um. Mantronics. King of Beats, dude. Kurt Mantronics is fuckin' awesome.
10770860	10776700	Uh, Tag Team, whoop, there it is. Once again in another game. Uh, mixed with, uh, 45King,
10776700	10783140	the 900 number. And then Beastie Boys, uh, Triple Trouble mixed with Tone Lock, uh, Funky
10783140	10790620	Cold Medina. And then, uh, December 21st, the Linkin Park mix pack with, uh, The Catalyst
10790620	10797620	Does It Offend You, Yeah, uh, Remix. And then, uh, When They Come For Me Remix and Points
10797660	10800220	of Authority Remix. The Points of Authority is gonna be awesome, so.
10800220	10803620	Okay, I have a call sitting on hold, sorry. Uh, caller, you're on the air. Hi, you're
10803620	10807660	on Orange House Radio. Who's this? It's Rama, and this time I wasn't even trying to get
10807660	10810580	on before everybody else. I knew, you know what, I was so distracted because I was taking
10810580	10814020	the picture of Jamie and making a unicorn out of her because I'm looking at these, what
10814020	10818980	the hell are these pictures on the website? You have problems. You know you love them.
10818980	10822540	I look like a Para Para girl in these versions. That's exactly it. I'm gonna make this my
10822540	10829540	Facebook picture. I love that. You should totally do it, Rama. I will. Uh, sorry, Rama.
10829540	10833380	So, so anyway, check OrangeHouseRadio.com in just a few seconds because I should have
10833380	10837460	Jamie's unicorn picture up there in a minute where it looks like the cat is jerking off
10837460	10841460	her horn. It's amazing. Alright. Hi, Rama, how are you?
10841460	10848460	Um, um, yeah. Damn it, Scott. You sure don't have a way of derailing, don't you?
10848660	10852260	Yeah, well, you know what, look, I just want to point out, I want to remind you, our guest
10852260	10858660	tonight made a game called Techno Kitten Adventure. Which I downloaded. What'd you think?
10858660	10863540	I haven't played it yet because I found a moe Japanese game on the live marketplace,
10863540	10867060	downloaded that, and had my roommate playing it for the last 20 minutes.
10867060	10868260	Nice. Yes.
10868900	10872340	Sorry, I'm looking at Jamie's picture. Tonight's been a great night for pictures.
10872340	10876820	Anyway, excuse me. Uh, so what did you call in to talk about tonight?
10877380	10880740	I really want to talk about a couple of things, but it turns into a lot of things,
10880740	10886900	but I'll make it short and sweet as possible. Number one, this whole German age thing,
10886900	10891380	for obvious reasons, I'm kind of sort of offended by it, but I'll let that be.
10891380	10894660	Wait, why are you offended by this? It's just whackin'.
10894660	10898180	Um, let's just say I have people in my family who have died of said disease.
10899300	10902100	I see. So you find this to be disrespectful?
10902100	10902740	Yeah.
10902740	10908500	Hmm. Okay, interesting. This is interesting because, well,
10910420	10916100	is it just disrespectful because it seems to be so trashy and in your face type of thing, or what is it?
10916100	10918580	That pretty much is the case.
10920100	10923060	What do you think about this whole, I've got to pick your brain on this,
10923060	10927620	and I'm sorry because I know this is a sensitive issue to you, but I want to ask this question
10927620	10930820	because this is something that's been on my mind this week and it really has nothing to do with
10930820	10935860	gaming, but whatever. It's been an interesting part B tonight. Have you seen that whole campaign
10935860	10942500	of the celebrities who have quit Twitter to try and raise a million dollars for AIDS awareness
10942500	10948500	where they're all lying in the coffins dead and so forth? What do you think of that whole thing?
10949700	10955380	I think it was quite ridiculous and I don't know if you saw, but on my personal Facebook page,
10955380	10959460	I made a statement about that and a few people agreed with me about it.
10959460	10960340	No, I missed it.
10961540	10965860	I'll link it to you later. I have made a personal statement about how I truly felt.
10966580	10970020	And can you summarize it or am I getting a little too-
10970020	10976900	Long story short, I understand this epidemic, but instead of dealing with the whole world event,
10976900	10982900	let's take care of the America first. Let's take care of that AIDS issue and the US first before
10982900	10987540	we go running around taking care of everybody else. Why give all that money to those world
10987540	10992660	charities when you can send that same amount of money to American charities for the same cause?
10993220	10998820	Well, I would hope that we can find a cure and that'll be good for everybody. That's my hope.
10998820	11002260	All right. Well, I didn't mean to derail, but-
11002260	11002900	That's cool.
11002900	11005860	What else is on your mind tonight besides potentially offensive games?
11006580	11010500	The whole thing about people not being able to get over themselves because
11010500	11015460	guys make these compliments and so forth, if I had an issue with that,
11015460	11021700	I wouldn't be able to go to conventions because half the people I roll with are gay,
11021700	11025860	lesbian, transgender. We have a good time. We go to the cause, we party,
11025860	11031380	we drink our asses off. It's all good. When I was working in Staples, I had a couple of
11031380	11035700	gay guys I used to hang with who always compliment me and like, you know,
11036260	11041140	mack on me, so on and so forth. I thought it was amusing and so did they. I had no problem with it.
11041700	11047060	Right. Like I'm sure, you know, a lot of straight people have that friend of the opposite gender,
11047060	11053140	like a guy, a straight guy has that girl that he flirts with, but it's nothing more than that,
11053140	11059300	you know? I'm sure there's, you probably have girls, not just gay guys, but girlfriends,
11059300	11062420	not, I don't know, friend girls that you do that with too, you know?
11063300	11067700	Yeah. Let's just say I did that one time and let's just say the two girls ended up having,
11067700	11071460	um, lap dance with each other. This was at a convention a couple of years ago. I was like,
11071460	11072340	holy shit, I'm good.
11072340	11075460	Well, now you're just talking about an anime convention and everybody,
11075460	11084820	everybody there is just horny. It's not really a gay or straight issue. It's just a horny issue.
11084820	11087140	Wow. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll give you that.
11087140	11090340	All right. Anything else on your mind before I let you go and get more calls?
11090340	11094180	I played that, that rom hack of Super Mario Brothers 3. That thing is
11094180	11096020	three levels below asshole Mario.
11099300	11103140	Three levels below, huh? That's a pretty precise rating. All right.
11103140	11107380	All right. I got to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for your insight tonight.
11107380	11112660	I appreciate it. Take care, buddy. You know, I was just telling the significant other,
11112660	11115700	we really need to go to New York city. And when we go, we're crashing with Rama
11116580	11120660	or as extra for would say, Randy. So you better be careful. Cause uh,
11120660	11123780	I really want to get back to New York city. It's been a very long time. And my one friend
11123780	11128660	that lived there moved to Texas. So I'm coming to, I'm coming to the couches of OLR listeners.
11128660	11136820	One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is orange lounge radio. All one word.
11136820	11139620	If you want to give us a call, we probably got time for about one more call. We are running a
11139620	11144740	little long tonight. So, uh, probably because the interview earlier, um, meanwhile, while we wait
11144740	11148420	for the phone to ring, Loki, do you have any other last minute stories? I don't know if you spent
11148420	11153860	them all or what? I've only done one of them. So no, I haven't spent them. All right. Then what
11153860	11160980	else? Uh, let's see. What else can we talk about here? How about, uh, let me just look up here.
11162100	11171700	Why is it open? It's odd. Um, hold on. Somehow it navigated while I wait for your riveting
11171700	11177620	last minute stories. Let me go to at least one more call here. Oh my God. Oh, hello. Hi.
11177620	11183860	Yes, it's Legend of Zaku here. Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, Legend of Zaku. Oh my God. What's
11183860	11188820	on your mind? Uh, nothing much. Just trying to kill a Sunday at night before heading to work
11188820	11193380	tomorrow. But yeah, you know, a lot of games came out in the past couple of weeks, you know,
11194180	11198900	that I've been trying, you know, dying to talk about. Like obviously Gran Turismo 5,
11198900	11205460	even though I don't have a PS3 yet, that's on my top list right now. And so we're basically just
11205460	11211140	trying to catch up on some other 360 games that I haven't been able to play. Let's just say I managed
11211140	11216340	to get a 360 again. Well, talk to us. What have you been playing? Playing catch up again. What
11216340	11222740	have you been playing? Um, when I didn't have my 360, it was nothing but like Left 4 Dead and
11222740	11228020	battlefields on my computer. But now I'm just playing, you know, small stuff like Sonic 4,
11228020	11235940	Ace Combat 6, Resident Evil 5. Although hopefully my girlfriend will hook me up with more recent
11235940	11240340	games for Christmas. I've already gave her a wishlist of what to get me. Is that what you
11240340	11245140	asked Santa for? Well, yes, Santa the four of my girlfriends is willing to spend money on me,
11245140	11249540	just as I'm willing to spend money on her. Okay, very cool. Well, tell us about like,
11249540	11252740	what's your favorite game been that you've discovered in the past couple of weeks since
11252740	11257860	you got your 360 back? I don't know. I mean, Sonic 4 has been really challenging so far.
11257860	11262420	Really? There's been a lot of hate on Sonic 4. There's been a lot a lot of hate on Sonic 4.
11262420	11266660	Do you disagree? You think the game's awesome? No, it kind of feels like a classic Sonic game.
11266660	11273060	I know it still has elements from the recent ones, like the whole homing attack thing. I mean,
11273060	11277700	I could do without it, but it's just, you're right. Some may say it's not fluid enough,
11277700	11281700	because it doesn't, it's not, it's not like the old fashioned Sonic where the screen would just
11281700	11287380	like literally breeze by every time he just like, every time he literally moves. So yeah,
11287380	11292420	he's gonna have some sense, he's gonna have some hate from those classic fans, and I'm one of them
11292420	11298740	because I grew up on that. But on the other hand, it's just, it's much spiffier now. I mean,
11298740	11302500	the important thing is that Sega managed to maintain the mechanics more or less,
11302500	11306260	so you gotta give them credit for not, you know, screwing their pooch yet again.
11308020	11312500	Okay, all right. What do you think of the new one, and I apologize, you might have mentioned
11312500	11317780	it a little bit. What about Sonic Colors? I haven't played that game yet since I don't own
11317780	11324980	a Wii or DS, but I, from what I've seen, it's probably the same gameplay. It's mostly platform
11324980	11329540	now, from what I hear. I mean, 2D platform. There's been a lot of people saying Sonic
11329540	11336020	Colors is where it's at right now in the Sonic universe, so. Right, I mean, I guess because it's
11336020	11342420	like, you know, I don't know, I guess it maintains the same type of gameplay. As I said, I've never
11342420	11347460	played Sonic Colors yet, and that's one thing I need, a Wii. I should have bought one when it was
11347460	11351300	a hundred bucks at GameStop over Black Friday. You never know when they might do the next price
11351300	11354580	cut. I don't know if they'll get that low, but then again, the PS2 can take that low. No, but
11354580	11358900	I mean, that was for used systems. I could have, just like I picked up a used 360 for a hundred
11358900	11367060	bucks. Alright. Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Legend of Zaku? DDRX2 is going to,
11367060	11374340	well, they're taking orders for it. It's supposed to ship out in two weeks. So, every, it's just,
11375060	11381220	so far, it's shaping up to be pretty solid at this point. You know, fears about, like,
11381220	11385300	drifting arrows and what the, you know, the community was saying about, like,
11385300	11390340	being off sync. They're starting to get quelled every, you know, as we speak right now. They've
11390340	11395060	already, let's just say the Konami's already taken folks from Bomani Style and already proven to
11395060	11400900	them that the final build of the game will be rock solid and something that the hardcores will
11400900	11406980	definitely start playing. Assuming the arcades shell out 10 grand for a new machine, which is
11406980	11410740	the only way you're going to get the new game. Or, unless you already have X, then you get the
11410740	11416820	upgrade. Alright. Well, by the way, you need to check out Home, because they have DDR machines
11416820	11420820	in Home, but you don't really get to play DDR on them. But I giggled when I saw the X2 machines
11420820	11427940	in the Konami home space. Yeah, and hopefully, you know, assuming I get my Christmas bonus this
11427940	11432660	year, I will definitely shell out money on a PS3. Alright. Alright, buddy, we're going to let you
11432660	11437540	go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call. Alright, take care. Bye! Alright,
11437540	11440100	that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. I'm sorry to those that didn't get through,
11440100	11443620	but we kind of are running along a little bit tonight, and we still want to get to the
11443620	11448260	afterbirth and all that good stuff. So, email us your thoughts. Mailbag at orangeontrader.com,
11448260	11453620	or send us tweets. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Meanwhile, we got to wrap it up, put the nail
11453620	11457540	in the coffin of the show. Do we have any last minute stories, Loki? Yeah, real quick. This is
11457540	11462900	kind of cool. From the same guy that did the Left 4 Dead demake, you know, kind of making the
11462900	11472260	pseudo NES version of Left 4 Dead, but, you know, it's a PC game. Pixel Force also did that too.
11472260	11479060	DJ Hero. Now they have an 8-bit DJ Hero game you can check out. It's got a bunch of cool chiptune
11479060	11486660	mashups, including the, this is kind of cool, the Ghostbusters theme and Huey Lewis and the
11486660	11494580	newest I Want a New Drug mix together. I can hear that. Apparently they said that one, it got some
11494580	11500100	of the background or whatever was sampled from the same song or something, but lots of cool stuff,
11500100	11507540	and you can check it out for free, and let's see where you can download that. Oh, ericruthgames.com.
11507540	11518900	So that's pretty cool. And then, what else here? The Xbox Live Rewards program, something that just
11518900	11524020	launched, so if you're a gold member or whatever, I don't even think you need to be a gold member,
11524580	11532020	but you get some kickback Microsoft points for different things that you do. For example,
11532020	11539860	renewing a one month gold membership will give you 10 Microsoft points back. Three months, 30,
11539860	11546420	and 12 months, 200. Purchase or renew an Xbox Live Gold Family Pack, that gives you 400.
11548100	11554580	Purchase or renew the first Xbox Live online gold membership, 100. Make your first purchase
11554580	11562340	on Xbox Live, another 100. Select content's gonna vary. If you activate and use Netflix on Xbox Live,
11562340	11569620	you get 100, and they have surveys for 20 Microsoft points. So, neat. You can do surveys
11569620	11574660	and get 20 Microsoft points? Yes. Interesting. It'd take a lot of surveys before you can actually
11574660	11578740	buy something. That's true. Well, you could get Technokit and Adventure for four surveys.
11578740	11585620	That is true. Alright. That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We're
11585620	11589540	about on out of here. Hey, if you liked what you heard tonight, or even if you didn't, you really
11589540	11597380	should still help us spread the word. Tell a couple of friends about our show. Go to our iTunes
11597380	11602660	and leave a nice five star review, or just spread the word. Tell a friend or two about our program,
11602660	11608820	because we don't have, you know, all the advertising dollars and so forth behind our show.
11608820	11614820	So just tell a friend or two. That's all we ask. Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for
11614820	11621620	our listeners tonight? You look lovely. Oh my, thank you. Rather so lovely. My final thought is,
11621620	11632180	thanks, but no thanks. Loki, your final thought? My final thought is, I'm tired. Alright. That's
11632180	11636900	gonna do it. Have a great week everybody. We really appreciate you, especially those folks
11636900	11640580	that tuned in live and stayed up through the whole thing. But even you podcasties,
