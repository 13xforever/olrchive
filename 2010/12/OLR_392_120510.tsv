32301	36862	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36902	39662	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
39722	48504	We are live on this December 5th of 2010 at www.allgames.com for the 392nd episode of our show.
48524	49224	That's a lot of shows.
49624	50684	Alright, my name is Rob Roberts.
50704	56746	I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games with my awesome co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
57266	58446	I have a little dreidel.
59113	60154	Is it made out of clay?
60374	60734	I don't know.
60995	61695	Yes.
62776	63897	No, mine was wood.
64358	65118	Happy Hanukkah, Ms.
65138	65459	Summers.
65659	66059	Thank you.
66680	68081	How have you been celebrating Hanukkah?
68101	69522	Did you do anything besides light some fire?
70863	71584	I went to temple.
71804	72445	Dan went with me.
73004	74745	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
97199	98380	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
117288	119470	and they were loving some Rock Band and I was like, okay.
119610	120971	I didn't really play much Rock Band.
121051	131059	I've actually, I'm not going to be doing a lot of gaming for the next week and a half because number one, Dan has Gran Turismo 5 and number two, finals.
132540	132840	Bummer.
133180	133941	Yeah, busy week.
134021	134922	Bummer on both counts.
135482	147709	I'm just kidding, I'm not hating on Gran Turismo 5 I am I'm not very good at the Uber driving games I'm angry I'm great at arcade racers How can the Veyron not be a premium car?
148629	155053	IDK Bastards Also say hello to, we gotta introduce, Tech Master Loki Hello How are you, Loki?
155533	161316	I'm doing fine Alrighty, good to hear it I know your wife celebrates Hanukkah, so have you been doing anything for that?
161616	162157	No No?
162297	162557	Alright
164301	165982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
191900	192580	I know, there you go.
192961	194782	Maybe this is something I could do while I'm not working.
194802	198143	I also do want to take a moment to poll our listeners and send us an email.
198363	198523	Sure.
198904	201105	At mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com so Rob can read it.
201305	201565	Okay.
202165	202645	Wait a minute.
202786	207008	Hey, who would be interested in an Orange Lounge book?
208752	210194	I got a text message about this.
210254	212256	I want to know more about your thoughts on this.
213297	214739	Why you suddenly want to do a book.
214919	219024	Well, I'm sure the not having a job right now has a lot to do with that.
219044	222328	To commemorate our fans and talk how awesome we are.
222508	223549	Would it be a pop-up book?
223569	225411	Because I'm not good with writing.
225812	228215	It would be a physical book to be ordered or...
229075	229596	An e-book.
229896	230457	An e-book.
230617	232458	Can it be something I listen to on my iPod?
232478	233679	Because that makes sense.
233919	243247	No, it's a physical book with pictures and links to goodies.
243267	244348	It's like the OLR yearbook.
244828	246009	and Easter Eggs.
265276	269897	I think Michelle on the Outsiders shows has a book deal, but I don't think it has anything to do with her shows.
270297	272598	You know the, what is that site?
272778	276238	Oh God, it's been everywhere, and it's her and her sister's site.
276818	277659	Damn you, autocorrect.
277919	278279	That's it.
278579	279299	Have you seen that site?
279599	280279	That's her site.
280799	280919	Oh.
281199	284160	And I think she's got a book now going on about it, so you know.
285480	288021	If all these other all games people can do a book, so can we.
288141	288421	Damn it.
288721	289061	Why not?
290253	290714	Alright, anyway.
292036	292937	Ours just won't be as good.
293417	293978	Okay, anyway.
294559	295420	I'm designing it.
295460	296402	It'll be amazing.
296602	297643	What did you see?
297723	299125	I just got kicked in the face.
299426	299886	Alright, anyway.
300968	303672	All books aside, let's talk about video games and the games we've been playing this week.
303712	305554	DarkSakura, what types of games have you been playing this week?
306215	306575	Nothing.
307255	307716	Nothing?
307816	312137	Well, actually, Star Trek Online, because I'm updating the Tribble server right now.
314358	315678	At, like, 1K.
317279	321981	So, I played some Solitaire.
322021	329323	I've been very busy because the American River Review, which is the magazine that I've done some design for, goes to print on Monday.
329743	331304	This is where the book idea is coming from.
331324	331404	Okay.
332128	336309	No, actually, I got the idea from the book I did for my client because we just published it.
337930	338690	It was really easy.
338950	341351	So it'd be very easy for us to do a book.
341871	345272	But back to this, the American River Review.
346392	351854	And as soon as we have the order information up, I'll be linking it to everybody because you have to buy a copy.
353434	376307	um but the American River Review is uh all of the uh literature the art digital physical media fashion and culinary for um American River College for 2011 we win tons of awards we beat out big schools we are amazing I did the culinary section I designed it anyway and um
378133	383575	I think it's definitely, you know, something that anybody should have a copy of because it really is an impressive product.
384015	384856	And we had our proofs.
384936	385936	We got our proofs last week.
386196	388357	And so that's what's been taking up my time instead of games.
389098	391098	But you said the hubby's been playing Gran Turismo 5, right?
391238	392679	Oh, well, we did have some Scott Pilgrim.
393699	394120	Oh, fun.
394260	395800	Yeah.
395940	397001	Is Gran Turismo 5 pretty?
397521	399422	Yes, except for the shadows are retarded.
399442	401863	A little early for that music.
401943	403243	Pretty as in that music.
403323	404123	As in that music?
404204	405224	Is as pretty as that music?
405589	408151	Some of the music in the game is very elevator-y.
409472	411893	There's new My Chemical Romance in there that makes me happy.
412094	416416	DarkSakura gave me a beer before tonight's show, so if things are a little bit off tonight like what just happened, you know what?
417357	418758	Just roll with it.
418778	419178	How's it off?
419198	420059	This always happens.
421946	427311	Well, at any rate, at any rate, it's got some stuff that needs to be fixed.
427531	433797	I still hate that all the people around the track are like, we're just standing here, we are stiff, we don't do anything but wave.
435158	439102	And I'd like to see more stuff going around, because the game can handle it, it's just not...
439642	442863	You want to see some women flashing their titties as you drive by.
442923	444184	That's what the game needs.
444384	450827	The cool thing in this game is that it has the Top Gear test track and the Stig.
451307	454408	And your driver looks kind of like the Stig from Top Gear.
454588	457809	But it doesn't have Rainbow Road, which is really disappointing.
458529	459510	It does have go-karts.
459930	463611	It would be awesome if they just, you know, because, come on, it's Gran Turismo.
463631	465912	They take themselves way too damn seriously.
467392	469053	Just throw in some wacky shit in there.
469093	472034	It's like, you know, we're driving in space now.
472694	480517	I mean, because it's a realistic sim racing game, but just put it in some very unrealistic situations and have fun.
482452	484673	Gran Turismo 6, In Space
507631	519376	You're supposed to be doing a patch that's supposed to fix a lot of the problems, so we'll see.
520177	523778	I just sit in there sometimes and listen to the elevator music and usually I fall asleep while Dan's playing.
525359	525799	So that's it.
527375	528436	Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
543227	564317	and it's it's really like it's like a chibi role-playing game but the whole battle system not so much I mean kind of like puzzle quests I guess they you have a grid of um you start off with a grid of a five by five and then um in the middle there's a grid of uh three three by three uh poker cards and
564837	588482	and the whole goal is to make up different poker hands and by doing that you do specific amounts of damage to the monster that you're attacking and then the monster does the same thing as well and you can charge up a wild card and stuff and then they have different magic that you can cast that rearranges some of the cards or does different things or shields that block certain damage and stuff like that.
588662	588822	Hmm.
589162	590102	It's actually really fun.
590122	592803	Is it a free game or when you had to pay?
593764	594984	No, it does cost money.
596445	600406	I don't know how much money, but it costs money.
601106	601926	Very awesome game.
602187	603407	I've been playing that most of the week.
603767	607688	Other than that, just probably Grand Theft Auto.
607869	609129	That's pretty much it.
609997	616999	Go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com There's a little bit of chatter going on with our ever-present fourth guest on the show, you guys.
617780	619140	Lots of talk on Gran Turismo 5.
619200	621681	TigerClaw in our chat room says, Gran Turismo 5 looks so amazing.
622041	626443	Can't help but be mesmerized by the graphics as I watch people play the game on Justin.TV.
626843	634145	And Justin.TV, from what I remember when we were doing our video feed on there in the old studio, it's not like it has the best quality.
634205	638087	So if that still comes across really well, that's pretty amazing.
642152	644896	I don't even remember that.
645276	646378	Wait, Loki just kind of did this.
646819	648281	Hey, it'll never happen.
648501	649242	Who cares?
649823	650143	It stinks.
650163	651305	It'll be coming out soon.
651365	652667	By soon we mean six years.
652847	653207	I don't know.
653608	653948	All right.
654829	655189	Let's see.
655409	660710	And some of the folks in chat are talking a little bit about Gran Turismo songs.
661530	665751	DJ Dark Knight says, Need to kickstart my heart to the best Gran Turismo song ever.
666271	670752	And Dark Tetsuya says, Actually, that's the first song on my Gran Turismo 3 playlist.
671533	675573	So a lot of talk about the soundtrack of Gran Turismo.
675593	676754	Have you noticed the soundtrack?
677134	679374	Well, I said earlier it has New My Chemical Romance in there.
679474	680034	Oh, that's right.
680154	680494	That's right.
680694	682035	You were talking about all that.
682855	683335	Well, once...
685065	691042	One song that I do not believe is on the Gran Turismo 5 soundtrack, but is in a game we're going to be talking about a little later tonight is...
694423	698648	That's right, that happy hardcore song from Techno Kitten Adventure.
698708	701310	It's Sea of Love by Frisco, if you wanted to know who it is.
701971	707777	You might remember last week on the show, we got a tweet saying that we needed to check out this game called Techno Kitten Adventure.
708358	712322	And we were laughing our ass off because it's just awesome.
712402	714965	Like, you know, laughing with them, not at them.
715585	717027	Thanks for watching!
740589	742351	to on-air interview in one week.
742411	744192	It's amazing what can happen here at OLR.
744212	746714	We're going to have Nick from Techno Kitten Adventure at 7 o'clock.
746754	748155	That's just over 30 minutes away.
748616	749236	That's exciting.
750417	752279	Loki, you checked out Techno Kitten Adventure, huh?
752459	754060	You thought it was a little basic.
754681	756662	Yeah, I played it a little bit.
757883	758243	I don't know.
759144	768532	It's similar to, I guess, like the Robot Unicorn Attack games where the concept's very simple, but what draws you into the game is just the fact that
769938	771600	It's so unusual, I guess.
773542	775844	But I mean, the gameplay itself, it's all one button.
775984	779468	You just, you know, a button to control the thrust on a jetpack.
779848	782211	I just, I don't know.
782251	787997	If I were to improve something upon the game, I would maybe tighten up the controls a little bit at level three.
788757	792281	And then also maybe, you know, make it a little harder.
793024	795205	We're going to ask them if there's any plans for a sequel.
795445	800207	Because the game has shown up in the top games on Xbox Live Indie Games, right?
800407	800887	It's there.
801367	803588	It's not like the number one game, but it's not number 500.
804609	805009	It's there.
805429	807030	So we definitely want to ask them about that.
807470	808810	And I played the game as well.
808970	811852	And even though it is as basic, let's say, as an Atari 2600 game...
813172	816534	I think... In fact, I'm pretty sure I played a game like this on Atari 2600.
817194	831921	I think the environment that he created and just the, you know, absurdity, outside-the-box type of thinking he constructed the game around is clearly this... Wouldn't this be funny if I combined X with Y and made Z?
832041	834362	And I think it really works, especially for a dollar.
834682	835262	It's a dollar.
836163	836423	Rob.
836663	836863	What?
836943	840405	Dear, please don't say combine X, Y, make Z. Y. Algebra hell.
840485	840685	Ouch.
841705	846707	Are you having flashbacks to school?
846747	847947	That's what my final is in.
848228	851669	If 2X plus Y equals Z, solve for kitten.
854490	854690	Meow.
855714	855914	All right.
856175	857316	So we're going to talk a little bit about that.
857817	859880	And I want to know if he has any other games in the marketplace as well.
859920	861382	So we have to ask him all those questions.
861882	864105	And I think it's worth it for one whole dollar.
864846	866549	It's the type of game you're going to whip out a party.
866689	868651	Bobby's giving Loki a hard time.
868792	869152	Why is that?
869432	871776	You can't get more tight than one flipping button.
872136	884320	Well, you know, we were talking to Bobby, and of course Bobby Blackwolf is the gentleman that does the show before us at All Games Radio, the Bobby Blackwolf show every Sunday night at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern.
885120	887481	And he always has us on at the very end of the show, which is very nice.
887521	888181	He doesn't have to do that.
888541	893103	But we were talking about this game a little bit, and we were kind of talking about how
894318	905621	We like that somebody went there and did this and didn't just try to make a clone of some other game because we're all about the whole kind of like absurd, outside-the-box sorts of ideas.
905661	907562	Remember President Cat a year and a half ago?
908122	910202	Why were we all excited about President Cat?
910342	912663	It wasn't really the game itself, per se.
912703	915124	I'm sure the game itself was really just an average game.
915544	921685	And I think a lot of the blogs who ultimately reported on, wow, there's this podcast trying to get this game called President Cat localized.
921745	922866	What a bunch of weirdos!
923826	924646	And don't forget playing the piano.
950876	952957	Yes, and absolutely playing the piano.
953357	955418	Why can't we get original shit like that?
956019	959581	You know, why do we have to get these games we know are subpar and below?
960021	961381	It's just, I don't know.
961622	963062	Because we're America!
963282	963743	Yeah, I know.
963803	964103	Fuck you.
964183	965344	Everything is mediocre.
966204	966844	Alright, so anyway.
967225	970546	Oh yeah, Majin Makon in our chatroom says, Muscle March.
971087	974128	That was a pretty unique Wii game, I will say that.
974168	977550	There was at least that, so it's working.
978010	981931	Anyhow, so we'll get to more talk on TechnoKitten Adventure in about 30 minutes.
981951	983972	But in the meantime, My Gaming Week.
984012	985172	I didn't talk about My Gaming Week.
985372	988973	I guess I mentioned TechnoKitten Adventure and I didn't play a whole lot else.
989013	992114	I played quite a bit of World of Warcraft because there's big changes going on this week.
992154	993895	But I have the other show for that now.
995016	1009485	so not a whole lot I want to say here otherwise other games I played some more Super Meat Boy which I think is a great Xbox Live Arcade game and that was really about it I had a work trip this week so I didn't really get to play a whole lot of games at home so sorry guys I'll try to play more next week
1010345	1012726	Anyhow, housekeeping tonight.
1013446	1014227	Join our Facebook.
1014267	1016368	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1016388	1017308	And of course our Twitter.
1017368	1018949	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1018989	1021330	We'll be taking Twitter topics later in the show.
1021430	1022490	So definitely submit those topics.
1023131	1024251	And email.
1024571	1025132	Email our show.
1025172	1026812	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1026852	1029674	DarkSakura's going to read those in Part B a little later in the show.
1030194	1032175	For now though, we're going to get into the news.
1032695	1034616	Loki's going to start us off tonight with some gaming news.
1035376	1051813	Oh yes, um, so, you know, it was funny because they were actually, um, quoting, uh, one of the quotes made about this device, allegedly, was that where there's smoke there's fire, well...
1053013	1055254	I don't think you can get much more fire than this.
1055954	1064657	The PlayStation phone, of course, remember a while back they had some not so clear video of the device.
1065137	1069619	And people were like, well, it's probably changed quite a bit since then and whatnot.
1069659	1071740	But now they have really clear video.
1073520	1080582	showing this brand new device called the Sony Ericsson Zeus Z1 PlayStation phone.
1081622	1094225	And it kind of shows some of the features that it has, the slide-out controls, the dual kind of touchpad thing on the front that simulates the analog sticks.
1095005	1096925	Of course, the shoulder buttons as well.
1097746	1098686	Something that looks like...
1100487	1103529	They made possibly a front and back mounted camera.
1106171	1110234	Lots of neat stuff though that you would expect in like a PlayStation phone.
1110974	1118039	And they even had some video of course showing them going to like the actual PlayStation mode where you could play different games and stuff.
1118059	1121882	Of course there's no games loaded on there so couldn't really do anything with that.
1122683	1131274	Um, but it's very interesting to see all this stuff considering that they've kind of been denying, you know, oh yeah, we're not working on a PlayStation phone.
1132728	1140429	Obviously something I would be willing to bet you'll see at CES because they've shown off this new hardware stuff and it seems right up their alley.
1141030	1142610	Here's the question I've got to ask about this.
1142810	1145150	Is this the same thing as the PSP2?
1145730	1149631	Because we've heard rumors about a PSP phone and we've heard rumors about a PSP2.
1150031	1152572	And my question is, is it actually the same thing?
1152632	1160013	Because I thought the rumors about there being sliders on the back and all this other weird stuff that we're seeing in this video was for the PSP2.
1160493	1162594	And now that you mention it, that does make sense.
1163635	1168378	The not-so-clear video or pictures that we saw before were of the PlayStation Portable 2.
1169518	1174581	Of course, we've seen some pictures before of the PlayStation phone, but they're different.
1175942	1179864	Just in the design of how they are and stuff, they look different.
1180124	1182806	This is a little bit similar to the PSP Go, almost.
1183166	1184146	And it does look like a phone.
1184186	1190909	I mean, the slide-out keyboard, you know, you could almost replace that with a keyboard and be it, you know, just a normal Sony Ericsson phone.
1191369	1199512	Could it... Again, I hate to harp on this, but do you think that maybe the PSP2 is just this without the phone, like an iPod Touch is to an iPhone?
1200192	1201852	Possibly, and that would make sense.
1202192	1205574	I mean, that would be... It would make sense, I would think.
1206234	1212196	I don't know if it's going to be... I don't know if I really care for the idea that it has, like, a touchpad on the back of the device.
1212836	1216697	I mean, I think nowadays you kind of almost have to have everything as like a touch screen.
1217077	1218858	You can pet it and caress it from the back.
1219618	1222879	You can literally reach around your PSP and rub it a little.
1222959	1224080	I just don't understand.
1224440	1227461	I think it would be very awkward to have a touch pad on the back.
1227501	1239325	I mean, because I don't think that would lend itself well to the games unless it's just some sort of, you know, context sensitive touch pad or something like that in addition to other things.
1239545	1240165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1265541	1268384	I got the guy that's Bit.Trip Adventure.
1268905	1269285	Oh, okay.
1269305	1270026	Or whoever he is.
1270086	1270567	I have him.
1270907	1271588	He's in one of the Warp Zones.
1271608	1272469	I just saw some videos.
1272589	1275472	I think it's PC only, though, of the Minecraft guy.
1275573	1276534	It is PC only.
1276594	1277335	I'd heard about that.
1277375	1277675	Yeah.
1278897	1279798	Talk about cheap.
1280378	1280839	But, yeah.
1281980	1284203	So, I mean, definitely...
1285669	1287410	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1309066	1313869	The Go kind of stopped, pun intended, the PSP chat for a little while.
1313889	1318632	Because The Go, no matter how Sony or the fans try to spin it, was a miserable failure.
1319492	1324995	There's not a lot of stuff coming out from Sony for the PSP anytime soon.
1325456	1329218	Other than, the only thing I've seen was Podapon 3.
1330579	1332540	Which, so what?
1332640	1336102	The second one that you were selling as a download title.
1337022	1338003	I don't really know if that's...
1339884	1340685	A lot to talk about.
1340705	1344007	And that could be the very last game they have in development for the original PSP.
1344147	1346249	It could be just all now PSP2 stuff.
1346389	1348891	And I don't know if this would actually be marketed as a PSP phone.
1348931	1352414	To me, it happens to be... I mean, it's not branded as a Sony PlayStation Portable.
1352434	1353475	It's branded as an Ericsson.
1354035	1355116	Granted, it's a prototype.
1356497	1362645	But it still strikes me as, oh, it's this phone that happens to have PSP playing capabilities.
1363006	1371217	Just like there was that GameCube that was marketed as a DVD player that happened to play GameCube games, but they didn't call it a GameCube.
1371237	1371978	The Panasonic Q?
1371998	1372559	Yes, that's right.
1372579	1373781	The Panasonic Q. Thank you.
1374301	1374661	PSP-2
1397180	1404667	And also possibly, you know, something that's also that little touch panel thing that's on the front of the PSP phone.
1405308	1407189	Perhaps this is where this patent comes from.
1407650	1412895	They're saying that it uses a two-fingered touch gestures for data manipulation.
1413515	1416678	And they specify that the touch interface may be separate from the main display.
1418080	1419841	Very similar to what we saw with the PSP2.
1420061	1421062	And they also said that...
1423024	1423585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1442179	1442759	So, I don't know.
1442919	1454442	It's interesting, though, that they're putting out the... I mean, just based off what we've seen, I guess it's not make... I would be willing to bet that this thing's going to have a touchpad on the back for the PSP 2.
1454502	1458823	It's going to have a touchpad on the front for, you know, the PSP phone or whatever.
1459263	1465144	I mean, the stuff that we've heard over and over again and seen pictures of, I don't think this is going to change all of a sudden, so...
1466144	1467664	Yeah, that's probably what we're going to expect.
1467824	1472185	And if they're going to announce this at CES, you only have a few more weeks to wait anyways.
1472226	1475486	I mean, it's mid-January, so... I don't know.
1475626	1477147	It's probably coming.
1477527	1479607	You gotta know they're pissed about this, though.
1479767	1480648	They are pissed about this video.
1480668	1485069	Every single secret that they've had just leaks out.
1485569	1486329	Sony, man, I...
1488524	1489924	They need to do something about that.
1490384	1492865	Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangehauntradio.com.
1493185	1498786	SSJ100Matt, responding to a comment I made a minute ago, says, Why would I give my PSP a reach around?
1498826	1499927	It never did anything for me.
1500247	1501307	It never made me a sandwich.
1501827	1502607	That's a good question.
1503207	1509469	AlphaKananagram says, I don't think this phone is the graphical powerhouse the developers are saying the PSP 2 will be.
1509849	1510309	That's true.
1510369	1517771	There was that chatter, I think, that we covered on the show a few weeks ago from a developer saying, We've seen it, and it's a huge graphical powerhouse.
1518371	1526635	So, which might explain how they plan to compete with the 3DS by presenting better quality graphics, perhaps, than what you're going to see in 3D.
1526655	1529076	Because maybe the 3D thing will get old real quick.
1529596	1529856	Who knows?
1530417	1534999	BlackWolf seems to think that the PSP 2 will be at Game Developers Conference.
1535179	1537160	Might be the better place to debut it.
1537620	1538261	GameDeveloperConference.com
1554085	1556387	Oh, by the way, totally left that out of my gaming week.
1556787	1562093	But on a listener's tip, I did try going into home this week and doing the whole DDR room or whatever.
1562113	1563975	I couldn't even get it to work.
1564856	1565356	I gave up.
1565937	1567218	I threw my controller into fitterage.
1568692	1576674	Let's see, and then some folks are saying that it was the Panasonic Q, or as Frisbee says, the Panasonic QQQ.
1577995	1586537	And lastly, Tigerclaw says, the PSP phone is just Sony trying to get into the iPhone and Android market for an app gaming perspective.
1587818	1590701	Maybe trying to expand the Sony App Store or whatever.
1590781	1597848	Trying to get more PS1 game sales and the cross-platform PSN games you can buy and movies.
1598268	1601992	Because you know this thing will do everything the PlayStation Portable already does.
1603093	1605255	Trying to expand the marketplace potential, perhaps.
1606357	1606757	Good thoughts.
1607312	1608553	All right, well, moving on to another story.
1609093	1612575	This is a little bit of a follow-up to something that had come up last week.
1612915	1614996	Remember when I mentioned that Harmonix is for sale?
1616237	1622360	Well, sadly, I'm not reporting about a buyer tonight, but I am saying somebody has said they are out of the picture, and you might be surprised.
1623081	1626283	It came from an interview with Bloomberg at Bloomberg.com.
1626643	1635548	The CEO of Electronic Arts, John Riccatello, actually has said that the company has no interest in pursuing more multi-million dollar acquisitions for now.
1636008	1642973	The company is going to focus on better integrating some of the casual game developers, such as Playfish and some of the other casual gaming things.
1642993	1644274	I imagine Pogo is a part of that too.
1646455	1649277	Of course, the people asked, are you interested in harmonics?
1649777	1655281	And Riccatello said, if we did that, it would, quote, look like I'm doubling down on yesterday.
1655801	1665808	I'm sure some smart investor will buy the business feeling they can catch a falling knife, but more people have been cut trying to catch falling knives that have benefited from getting the timing exactly right.
1666168	1666328	Ouch.
1666388	1666568	Ouch.
1688743	1690545	This whole rock band phenomenon.
1690985	1693027	They made the original Guitar Hero game.
1693067	1693387	Remember?
1693447	1696270	They were working with Activision back then and Red Octane and all that.
1696290	1697691	They made the original Guitar Hero.
1698192	1701295	They split off to do rock band ABC and so on.
1702105	1705048	Who's to say Harmonix is not going to make the next big thing?
1705988	1721041	That just seems, I mean, I realize you're taking a little bit of a gamble there, but if there's one thing, there's one thing I could say in the nine, ten years practically we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio, the developers that take risks are the ones that get the big payoffs.
1721421	1730489	The ones that just sit there with their thumbs up their rear, making the same old crap year after year, Konami, don't usually get to have the big payoffs.
1731665	1733546	Konami doesn't really do that anymore.
1733586	1734867	Well, okay, with their dancing games.
1734907	1739189	As far as the music games go and the stuff this show started about, yes, they did for a very long time.
1739649	1744251	And granted, they've got some other neat stuff coming out now and they still have Metal Gear, whatever.
1744991	1747392	But as far as the music game goes, that's how I feel.
1747853	1755356	To quote the 62nd Ferengi Rule of Acquisition, the riskier the road, the greater the profit.
1757277	1757417	Hmm.
1760700	1768386	So, maybe they should be putting the masters of business forward.
1768766	1778413	Now, BlackWolf in our chatroom is saying that the falling knife thing is actually a misquote and the whole thing is not quite... I'm trying to look at what part of the story this is in here.
1778433	1779794	He just linked us to something here.
1780694	1784277	I guess he actually came out and said, I think the music genre is going to recover.
1784617	1785918	I don't know exactly how.
1785958	1787659	It could be based on some new innovation.
1788000	1789681	Maybe it all becomes dance-based.
1790114	1791335	He likes Harmonix, and he said,
1813949	1831400	the nervous investor would be worried about the decline of the music sector feeling like a falling knife the only part of that conversation that got reported was the falling knife part so he's saying I was misquoted although I guess they did use a part that he gave him but whatever he didn't mean to come off as harsh as he did so
1832040	1838727	Okay, at least I like the fact that he acknowledges that, you know, harmonics could be also sitting on this big thing here with Dance Central.
1838807	1839828	And I think that's true.
1840349	1842090	So I don't frown as much as I did.
1842551	1847136	But it doesn't change the fact that they aren't interested in acquiring harmonics at this time.
1847796	1852681	And even though maybe Falling Knife might have been harsh, it seems to be that the motivation behind that is...
1853742	1857245	They don't have that next big thing just right yet, I guess.
1858126	1862090	Although it is a little weird because he says Dance Central seems to be a big deal, but I don't want it.
1862930	1863171	Okay.
1864252	1864612	Fair enough.
1864772	1865192	Fair loss.
1866494	1867074	Let's move on.
1867134	1867695	DarkSakura.
1868974	1891034	Well, for the Doctor Who fans like myself, there will be the last episode for the Doctor Who The Adventure Games called Shadows of the Vashta Narada, which for anyone who doesn't remember that one, this was the episode where they were stuck in the library and these things were eating the people, and it was the first episode that River Song showed up in.
1891354	1894297	Where can you buy it here in the US?
1915265	1916745	I would assume the BBC website.
1939372	1939552	Hmm.
1940612	1940973	Interesting.
1942493	1944994	The Underwater Christmas Adventure for Doctor Who.
1945154	1951216	Do you think these... What I think is interesting about this, because the BBC is kind of paying for these games, right?
1951316	1953057	They're paying for the development, right?
1953397	1954037	So it's kind of like...
1955218	1960261	It's a very different... And you have to pardon my ignorance here a little bit, but I've never lived in another country.
1960321	1973871	All I know is it's a very different setup here in America than it is in Britain, where it's a lot more... I guess you could say, to me, it seems like the BBC is sort of like their PBS.
1974731	1978914	But over here in America, we think of PBS as the network that plays...
1979815	1983237	Classic, Opera, Shows, Sesame Street, and occasionally Video Games Live.
1983277	1991063	I don't think the BBC is... But what I'm saying over there, they're actually making this more cutting-edge programming.
1991463	1994625	It's like, imagine if PBS was making the shows Fox was making.
1994905	1995846	That's kind of what it is.
1996306	1996607	I don't know.
1996647	1997267	That's how it strikes me.
1997627	2007474	But my point is, it's interesting that now we have this whole gaming thing coming out of that that is part of the public broadcasting industry.
2008120	2010262	Yet here, we don't have anything like that.
2010322	2011803	PBS doesn't really make games.
2012203	2015766	And I think there's been stories on the show before about how there's kind of been a call for that.
2015806	2028997	Like why do we have the public broadcasting system, but yet we don't have anything for making games outside of, I don't know, maybe like America's Army, although that's still the government contracting with somebody else to make that for recruitment purposes.
2029057	2030258	That's the closest thing I can think of.
2030768	2040015	Well, just to let you know, the Doctor Who games are actually up on direct2drive.com.
2040575	2044498	You can just search for them there, but I'm going to put a link to the downloads in the chat room.
2045939	2049661	I like the point that Tigerclaw is making in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2050082	2052704	Let's not forget PBS also plays British shows.
2053484	2055385	The first time I heard Doctor Who was PBS.
2055606	2058548	Well, that was my introduction to Doctor Who, and when I was little...
2060389	2063830	I like Star Trek now, don't get me wrong, but when I was little, I didn't like Star Trek at all.
2064231	2072313	I was watching Doctor Who, which I thought was a lot cooler and a lot neater because the concept was neat and it was this crazy old man and all these people running around with him.
2073174	2075915	And my first Doctor was the fourth Doctor with Sarah Jane.
2076455	2078395	And she's to this day my favorite companion.
2078776	2079776	She's back in the series.
2079796	2081597	She has her own series and that makes me happy.
2082177	2084718	But Doctor Who is just awesome.
2086339	2088600	Majinami... Majinamicon.
2088861	2089841	Say Maji.
2090162	2090582	Maji.
2090762	2091283	Namicon.
2091343	2091883	Namicon.
2092944	2093304	Whatever.
2093564	2095186	Majinamicon in our chat.
2095246	2097708	I thought that's what I said before and I got yelled at for mispronouncing it.
2097748	2098008	Whatever.
2098488	2099829	Says... Namicron.
2100029	2106294	And yet some political extremists want to shut down all public broadcasts, radio, TV, etc.
2106375	2107255	If I recall correctly.
2107275	2108176	Yeah, I've heard that too.
2109097	2111158	And... I don't know.
2111198	2111398	That...
2113402	2114563	It's because of NPR.
2114783	2124232	The thought makes me sad because when I think of PBS, I think of Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and Bob Ross and shows like that that wouldn't exist without PBS.
2124352	2126535	And it just makes me very sad.
2126975	2133502	I mean, granted, maybe I haven't yet developed an appreciation for some of the other stuff they show, like not in the morning or not for children, but...
2134142	2136784	I don't know, it just would be very sad if that were to go away.
2136804	2138284	You know what else PBS gave us?
2138905	2141906	Fawlty Towers for our British television.
2142247	2142867	Red Dwarf.
2144568	2145368	I love Red Dwarf.
2146149	2151772	You know, I watched Keeping Up Appearances and Are You Being Served and Monty Python's Flying Circus.
2152893	2157175	We need more of this on the PBS, but now we have BBC America, I guess.
2159083	2161225	Gamer Girl in our chatroom says, Wait, I'm lost.
2161305	2162846	Why do they want to shut down PBS?
2163727	2175835	Without getting too political on the show, I think it just boils down to that whole, you're poisoning the public minds with these crazy liberal ideas that PBS gives or whatever, which is a little bit ludicrous to me.
2176215	2180318	But I think as DarkSakura referenced, a lot of it comes back to NPR.
2180839	2188104	And when some people don't like what a public organization is saying, they want to shut it down, I guess is...
2188604	2191087	The best way I can cut it.
2191688	2195453	But there's a lot of reading between the lines that goes with that type of stuff too.
2195653	2199197	NPR gets a lot of its funding too from the Democratic Party.
2200319	2204604	And PBS gets funding from political sources.
2205745	2205925	But...
2207427	2210769	I think that if people want to pay for it, let them pay for it.
2210889	2211790	It's not your problem.
2211830	2212650	Just don't listen to it.
2213170	2217673	But it's people too busy being right and wanting others to think just like they do.
2218654	2220495	That's the bottom line.
2221975	2222276	All right.
2222656	2224017	But I'm not going to go any further than that.
2224037	2229720	I'm just saying people being too busy being right and wanting other people to think the way they do.
2230365	2230665	All right.
2231185	2234907	Well, let's talk about something we can all appreciate, and that is sales.
2235087	2235507	Right, Loki?
2236127	2236487	Oh, yes.
2237167	2239928	Of course, Black Friday always means lots of big sales.
2240088	2247010	And with that, you know the game companies have to come out and start waving their cock around, I guess.
2248331	2250492	Kinect, of course, sold very well.
2251212	2255813	And they've reached 2.5 million units with the help of Black Friday.
2256273	2257694	And that's worldwide, of course.
2258394	2262257	And of course, they break it down, that's 100,000 units a day.
2263317	2270542	And that they're on track to meet their original goal of 5 million units sold this holiday.
2270682	2274224	So that's pretty awesome, I guess.
2274564	2280208	And I think they've already bypassed the move sales from what I remember as well.
2281288	2299302	Um, of course, Nintendo, um, they're saying that they sold a lot of DS's and Wii's during Black Friday, uh, might help that they also had a lot of, uh, new colors, uh, for different stuff, uh, coming out, new DSi XL colors, uh, I still don't understand why people go crazy about the colors, but whatever.
2300826	2308589	They had the 25th Anniversary Red systems with Mario Kart in there.
2308770	2314312	They also had the Red Weaves, which people are going crazy over for no apparent reason.
2315052	2319854	And the Orange and Green systems with different games with that.
2320235	2323516	Anyways, they sold 900,000 DS units.
2323636	2329959	That's DS, DS Lite, DS Lite XL, or DSi's, I guess.
2330960	2347118	and then of course 600,000 Wii's were sold and that's during the week of November 21st through the 27th that's really interesting about especially the number of Kinect sales I mean I'm hearing more people in the kind of the mass media quote-unquote
2347598	2349078	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2370884	2372246	and Nintendo did the same thing.
2372286	2374130	We kind of think you're going to do the same thing with Kinect.
2374170	2378538	It won't meet that goal, but it looks like the supply is actually meeting the demand a little bit.
2378799	2380181	In certain markets, of course.
2381183	2381484	How so?
2381980	2408831	Well, because, you know, the smaller guys obviously aren't getting enough I'm sure as hell know we aren't getting enough shipments of that shit They're sending them all to retail, those fuckers So, yeah Well, they obviously are shipping them somewhere because they're selling those units, so I don't know They're still going for a pretty penny, though, on eBay, that's for sure
2410641	2410981	All right.
2411702	2411982	Really?
2412042	2412302	How much?
2412802	2414423	What's the reseller market look like on that?
2414443	2415984	Because I remember with some of those things.
2416024	2416805	Oh, my gosh.
2417105	2419406	Usually $50 to $100 over retail.
2420347	2421207	And they're going pretty good.
2421468	2421728	Wow.
2422648	2422888	All right.
2422908	2425630	Well, let's get into a big story from this week.
2427531	2428011	I don't know.
2428612	2431093	And Loki asked me before the show, why are we reporting on this?
2431153	2431994	And I don't know.
2432074	2434255	But I think the response to this is kind of funny.
2434315	2435336	So let me tell you what's going on.
2436056	2438179	Peta decided to parody another game this week.
2438219	2439860	You know, they've done some video game parodies.
2439901	2443224	They had like, I think there was like a Super Mario Brothers parody and some other crap too.
2443685	2450412	But Super Meat Boy was the last game they set their eyes on and they decided to make this parody called Super Tofu Boy.
2451233	2457476	and SuperTofuBoy is, you know, you play a chunk of tofu instead of a chunk of meat.
2457836	2460678	They've made Super Meat Boy the enemy in the game.
2461418	2465920	Quote, Meat Boy is a vengeful, bloody cube of rotting animal flesh and he smells.
2466820	2474184	After a short-lived fling with Bandage Girl, he became enraged when he was dumped for the tasty and satisfying Tofu Boy, etc., etc.
2474224	2476725	That's the blabber setup from the PETA game website.
2477065	2477886	And the gameplay is...
2479026	2484168	It's fairly similar to Super Meat Boy, but it's obviously a cheap hack.
2485449	2486849	Actually, I shouldn't say a cheap hack.
2487429	2492692	Considering how fast this must have turned around, it's a pretty decent hack, dare I say it?
2492792	2496993	But whoever they've got programming the games at PETA seems to be pretty talented, like it or not.
2497694	2498014	Anyway...
2498974	2500516	Super Meat Boy, Super Tofu Boy,
2514091	2514371	None.
2514451	2515832	PETA can't change anything.
2517193	2519054	That was pretty much their response to the whole thing.
2519574	2520555	Not quite just that, though.
2520575	2534023	If you read some of the other follow-up tweets and so on, apparently the guy who made Super Meat Boy went on to the PETA forums and posted under some different names to try to call attention to the game to, I guess, basically get free promotion.
2534603	2535344	And it worked!
2535925	2537166	That's the crazy part.
2537546	2541150	I don't know if he's making that up in retrospect, but I don't see why not.
2541210	2542891	I think that's actually kind of a smart thing to do.
2542951	2549998	Like, oh my god, can you believe they're making this game out of a moving piece of meat and glamorizing meat and meat is murder?
2551059	2552740	So I think that's kind of funny.
2552820	2554442	Tasty, tasty murder.
2554762	2558244	I think it's really funny that it worked in so many ways.
2558825	2571294	So anyway, now they've come out and said, well, since we were able to get basically free advertisement for Super Meat Boy, we're going to put Super Tofu Boy as an unlockable character in the PC version of the game.
2572715	2576818	So they came out and tweeted, if you type pedophile...
2577879	2585649	P-E-T-A-P-H-I-L-E at the character select screen, you will be able to play as Super Tofu Boy.
2585669	2587331	Wow, and I even made that joke earlier.
2588292	2589533	I had no idea.
2589674	2596402	Imagine Omicron says in here, the funny thing is that by Super Meat Boy creator's own admission, Meat Boy is a normal person without skin, not a hunk of meat.
2598444	2599684	Way to screw up, PETA!
2599744	2601485	It's just a game, for heaven's sake.
2602566	2604727	Again, I love Super Meat Boy.
2604887	2606367	It's a great arcade game.
2606508	2609949	I really think its only drawback is this whole, like, what?
2610069	2611090	It's a piece of meat?
2611170	2613511	Like, I don't... That's your mark... What?
2614191	2615012	That's the artwork?
2615092	2615332	Really?
2615372	2617033	That's the name of your game, Super Meat Boy?
2618353	2619394	But whatever, I didn't make it.
2620902	2623064	People probably say the same thing about Orange Lounge Radio.
2623085	2625307	Why the hell do you call your video game show Orange Lounge Radio?
2625327	2626208	You're not about oranges.
2626588	2627530	You're not in Orange County.
2627850	2630413	Frisbee makes a very good point and this is very true.
2631013	2634698	PETA, we euthanize more animals than we take in even though we don't support euthanization.
2635879	2636239	It's true.
2637000	2639383	I mean, they actually have to report all this stuff to the IRS.
2639443	2640544	It's a matter of public record.
2641525	2659034	by the way Edmund McMillan who is the co-creator of the game he admitted that he made fake usernames in PETA's forum pushing the game at them in hopes that something would happen PETA is 1000 times more well known than Super Meat Boy and the fact that they went out of their way to make a parody like this is beyond flattering and amazingly helpful
2660214	2672280	Edmund McMillan has said he was once a vegetarian and has worked as an animal control officer and he disagrees with PETA's total stance against the lab testing of animals and this is so interesting.
2672540	2683705	He's saying that being against the lab testing of animals means you're against these medical discoveries and treatments that save lives like his mom who is diabetic and that's why he's against PETA.
2684085	2692487	The person right under the PETA lady, Ingrid Newkirk, is a diabetic who is on insulin made from dog testing.
2693308	2693908	Interesting.
2694128	2694668	I know, right?
2694948	2695268	Right.
2695428	2696509	Fun double standard, right?
2697169	2701090	Anyway, why is it that this show keeps coming back to politics tonight?
2701250	2706911	I don't know, but I just found it very interesting that an author of a game trolled the PETA forums and got his way.
2706992	2708372	That's outstanding to me.
2709332	2710032	DarkSakura DarkSakura
2731713	2736895	I should try to sing it because it's much prettier than I'm giving it credit for.
2736915	2737836	I can play a little clip.
2739216	2740117	Not right now.
2740657	2745539	It's been nominated for a Grammy.
2745619	2753222	It's under Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist category from the composer's debut album Calling All Dawns.
2754747	2755808	It's a really pretty song.
2755928	2762831	I mean, it's been going around since they've included it with the Video Games Live.
2765052	2765632	It's gorgeous.
2765732	2766493	I really think it is.
2766593	2768193	So I hope that they win.
2769514	2770254	Here's a little clip.
2772235	2773736	It's kind of quiet.
2773776	2774416	Sorry, guys.
2774517	2775197	It's kind of quiet.
2782276	2789141	Civ 4 really did have this epic theme song to it, which obviously is this, and then Civ 5 just pales in comparison.
2789201	2794986	I mean, Civ 5's a great game, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't really have quite the moving song that Civ 4 did, so...
2795931	2823185	I'm happy to see that a video game song gets acknowledged with a Grammy nomination but here's the weird thing to me Civ 4 didn't like come out this year so it is not getting nominated because it's from Civ 4 it's getting nominated because Christopher Tinn ended up making an album that happened to come out in the past year that has this song on it so you wonder well did it get nominated because people knew the song already but Civ 4 is what a 4 or 5 year old game it wasn't nominated for a Grammy 4 or 5 years ago 2005 was it?
2823225	2823345	yeah
2825246	2854413	so it's it's kind of interesting that it took this long and you got to wonder that oh well maybe people knew about it from here who knows uh Black Wolf in our chat room wants to point out that Christopher Tinn the album was also nominated so no matter how people found it uh it's it's it and if you actually listen to the rest of the album itself it is a really good album you know it's not pop or rock it's very different it's a world kind of more um I don't want to say Enya but more of that it's PBS music
2854793	2855253	Actually.
2856694	2857535	And that's not a bad thing.
2858596	2861958	So, also, I like AkumaJP in our chatroom says, Lion King.
2861998	2864240	It does kind of sound like the theme of the Lion King, doesn't it, a little bit?
2864820	2865861	A little less Elton John, though?
2866762	2868503	It sounds like the freaking Avatar soundtrack.
2869384	2869664	Does it?
2869724	2871245	I've never really listened to the Avatar soundtrack.
2871305	2872446	Is it that good?
2873707	2874167	I like it.
2874227	2878190	I thought it had really pretty music in it, but it's the same type of the same theme.
2879091	2879211	Hmm.
2880103	2885768	Alright, well, I promised you guys that we were going to have an interview tonight, so we are going to give Nick a call.
2886208	2895136	He is the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure, and I'm really excited to talk to him about the game and how we got him on the show and everything.
2895176	2895997	So we're calling him right now.
2896397	2897758	This is totally live and unscripted.
2897798	2898599	Anything could happen, guys.
2898639	2904444	If you have questions, post them in our chat room at chat.orangelunchradio.com while we wait for him to pick up.
2906005	2907426	Wouldn't it be funny if this went to voicemail?
2907466	2908227	Like, oops, I forgot.
2908928	2909068	Hello?
2909428	2909568	Hello?
2934540	2940345	Our show was kind of founded on the games like Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania 2DX.
2940425	2942707	So we're definitely no stranger to happy hardcore.
2943248	2944689	And of course we love kittens.
2945029	2945450	Who doesn't?
2945770	2951154	So this game kind of seemed to be almost the perfect game in a way.
2951255	2954637	So we have to know, what inspired Techno Kitten Adventure, Nick?
2955979	2961023	Well, I recently discovered happy hardcore, which is the greatest genre of all time.
2961904	2962024	And
2963845	2970772	I played Robot Unicorn Attack a while ago, and that kind of gave the idea to incorporate music into a game.
2971652	2978278	But Robot Unicorn Attack didn't really have everything going to the music, it was more like a background sort of thing.
2980440	2983303	And also, I like kittens, as you said.
2983723	2984224	Who doesn't?
2984244	2986846	So I wanted to incorporate all three things into one.
2988883	2992305	Is this the first game you've ever made or do you have other XNA games out there?
2992345	2993665	Or was this like your first adventure?
2994886	2996606	I have a few more games out there.
2997146	2998047	Some of them are not very good.
2998807	3000928	One of the better ones is Physics Sandbox 2.
3002628	3004689	It's kind of like Crayon Physics Deluxe.
3006172	3007133	I don't know if you've played that.
3007153	3007393	A summer.
3007413	3009434	I didn't really spend too much time on it, though.
3009574	3011115	Most of the time when it's actually licensing the music.
3027509	3029391	Okay, that was the next thing I had to ask you about.
3029411	3033094	Because you didn't make or write a song specifically for this game.
3033154	3036817	You somehow licensed an existing song that's out there, right?
3037277	3042341	Tell me how you got the song and found the song and got the song in the game, ultimately.
3043282	3046504	Well, I'd heard the song before, like a trance version.
3047665	3052869	And then I discovered the happy hardcore version, which is from a company in the UK.
3053530	3055972	Pretty popular over there, but non-existent in the USA.
3056650	3061873	So I just contacted them and paid a fee and got to use it for the game.
3062333	3062573	Nice.
3062613	3066976	And that song, of course, is Frisco with Sea of Love is the song.
3066996	3068197	Yeah, DJ Hicks' remix.
3068497	3075881	Now, I don't know if you're allowed to tell us, so you can pass on this question if you want, but do they get a cut of the profits because you used the song?
3077699	3078779	I think I'm going to have to pass.
3078840	3080440	I'm not sure if I can answer that.
3080500	3081100	That's all right.
3081140	3081560	That's all right.
3082981	3084001	What are the possibilities?
3084841	3086002	Let me back up a little bit.
3086262	3088262	How successful has this game been for you?
3088702	3095464	Because I know you're only charging a dollar for it, but I also noticed it was in the top 50 indie games, which has got to be a hard place to get to.
3095604	3098785	So has this game been pretty successful for you money-wise?
3099705	3102126	It's actually been less successful than my other games.
3102586	3102926	Really?
3102966	3103647	But I think they were...
3105765	3110988	A lot more appropriate for the audience that goes to indie games, which seems to be like 13-year-olds.
3112149	3112850	Hey, wait a minute!
3115551	3116212	Wait a minute.
3117272	3120234	Alright, so it hasn't been as successful as Share the Games.
3120254	3124017	That's really interesting, but definitely there's been an audience for it.
3124137	3126678	I mean, do you plan to do anything else with this idea?
3128840	3135224	We are going to port it to Windows Phone 7, iPhone, and Android probably within the next three months.
3136167	3137268	I'll get it on my phone.
3159252	3162573	I was going to say, not bad for a bunch of 13-year-olds.
3162693	3165774	One of them's got their own company somewhere that's going to help you out.
3166094	3171396	What about, you know, I've got to ask about a potential sequel to Techno Kitten Adventure.
3171476	3173277	Is there a Techno Kitten Adventure 2 in the works?
3173977	3174977	Electric Boogaloo?
3174997	3180659	The company that contacted me said that depending on how well it does, they'll probably think about making a sequel.
3181359	3183160	I don't know if it'll be the same genre of music.
3183980	3187502	For me, I'd like it to be some more happy hardcore, but we'll see.
3187622	3188702	It'll probably be a different genre.
3189096	3190377	Well, I started off just wanting to make
3215183	3238219	and then have Happy Hardcore playing in the background kind of make it like Robot Unicorn Attack and then while I was doing that I made a few effects on accident that worked really well with the music and so I decided to have everything sync up with it which took like listening to the song a few hundred times unfortunately to get it right but you love Happy Hardcore so it's okay right?
3238908	3240248	Yeah, it's actually still a good song.
3240829	3242309	That's how great of a song it is.
3263775	3265636	So you've got to be careful, Nick, not to jump the shark.
3266117	3267538	So enjoy this.
3267558	3268599	I've played the metal version.
3269319	3270100	It sucked pretty bad.
3270400	3270740	Thank you.
3270941	3272402	Unless you do a techno shark.
3273863	3275284	Techno sharks with lasers adventures.
3275624	3275864	All right.
3276425	3284811	I've got a couple more questions for you, and that is, are you thinking, though, I know you've got the company that wants to do other things with this title and so forth.
3285231	3289655	Do you think maybe you're going to do another game that really has nothing to do with this whatsoever?
3290075	3295358	This is just kind of a one-off thing, and you have other games you want to do, or do you want to kind of play this out and see where it goes?
3296359	3303703	Right now I'm working on a music-based shoot-'em-up, which is going to be way more gameplay-based, rather than a simple one-button game.
3304564	3305785	Ah, very cool.
3306305	3308746	Anything else you can say about that right now, or is it all still in the works?
3310507	3316351	It's pretty much going to be a music visualizer going in the background, and then just really hardcore shoot-'em-ups.
3316835	3319136	and a couple other bullet holes sort of thing.
3337004	3338485	I look at it quite a bit, actually.
3338505	3339745	Yeah, and what do you think?
3339765	3339805	Um...
3362990	3365873	Most of them just say that it looks like it was made in MS Paint.
3365893	3368695	I haven't really read anything that horrified me.
3390458	3391358	Haters to the left.
3391798	3392379	Haters to the left.
3392619	3393039	You know what?
3393839	3396820	I kind of think the art style, in a way, is kind of part of the charm.
3396940	3403762	Like, if it had been all, like, 3D, HD, Uber effects, I don't think it would really be the same thing.
3404482	3405082	That make sense?
3405382	3407623	So, I say, you go.
3408203	3410884	And good luck with all those future projects.
3411184	3413264	Anything else you want to plug here on our little show?
3413924	3415245	Of upcoming projects or what have you?
3415265	3415445	No, thanks.
3416325	3416685	Alright.
3417005	3418706	Well, the game... You have a website or anything?
3418726	3419606	Official website for...
3420570	3421191	Not at the moment.
3421311	3424432	There should be a website and it'll work.
3424572	3426954	We'll let you guys know about it when Nick tells us about it.
3427314	3435619	The game is Technokitten Adventures and it's available right now on the Xbox Live Indie Games.
3436159	3440602	It's one whole dollar, which is really not a bad price at all.
3441782	3442983	It's the cost of a taco.
3443283	3447666	As I said earlier in the show, technically on Sundays it's the cost of three tacos.
3448426	3451909	A taco is for a moment, but techno kittens are forever.
3451949	3452590	Thanks for having me.
3472226	3472746	I will.
3472766	3473266	Alright, thank you.
3473306	3473807	Have a good night.
3473827	3474907	Bye.
3475447	3475967	I love it.
3476027	3482990	From tweet to call on the show, Techno Kitten Adventure, Nick from Techno Kitten Adventure.
3483010	3486030	He didn't tell me his last name, but we'll give him a little bit of anonymity.
3486070	3488251	It's not real ID here on the show after all.
3488531	3490412	Thanks to Nick for being such a good sport.
3491152	3495874	And Zom in our chatroom says, if you have $2, you can have Techno Kittens and a taco.
3496814	3500135	I don't know, in this economy, in this economy, it might be tough.
3500175	3500235	And
3500555	3501676	That's value!
3503278	3503538	All right.
3505580	3508843	Anyhow, let's move on to more stories.
3509083	3509904	Actually, release dates.
3509964	3511185	It's time for to get to the show.
3511225	3517811	So if you don't want to get Techno Kitten Adventure or you've already bought it and you want to look at other games, there's other stuff coming to a store near you, right, Loki?
3518351	3524197	Yes, and this will probably be the last week that stuff will be coming to a store near you, at least this year, because...
3524817	3527178	It is dying down to zero.
3527379	3530700	I mean, literally, I think the week after next, there's one game.
3531301	3533662	And the week after that, possibly another game.
3534282	3534963	And that's it.
3536523	3543267	But yeah, next week, though, the kind of coincide with it's a little bit early with the launch of the new Tron movie.
3543547	3569106	Tron Evolution it's going to be kind of a prequel to Tron Legacy and that'll be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and then they're going to be doing kind of an arena based sort of combat game it's Tron Legacy Battle Grid and that's coming out on the Wii oh and I guess it's also on PC as well
3569566	3570627	So definitely check that out.
3570667	3571548	That looks pretty exciting.
3572429	3578174	Oh, and then the Tron Battle Grids, I believe, is also on DS and possibly PSP.
3579095	3586763	SBKX Superbike World Championship on PlayStation 3 and I believe Xbox 360 as well.
3587483	3589605	And that's going to be kind of a street bike racing game.
3590486	3592288	Yogi Bear, the video game.
3595557	3595898	Right?
3596019	3597262	I hope that movie tanks.
3597864	3599690	But sadly there's kids that are going to want to see it.
3600031	3602252	You know, kind of a bit of a side note here.
3602732	3605513	I actually got an invite and I can't go to it.
3605633	3607073	Well, let me put it this way.
3607273	3609274	I'm not going to it.
3609374	3614596	For a Nielsen screening of a summer movie that's coming out next year.
3615096	3617016	And it's a computer animated comedy.
3617496	3621738	You don't happen to be sitting in the middle of summer as a computer animated comedy.
3622778	3623438	Smurfs the movie.
3623858	3624299	Oh no.
3624379	3624979	Fuck no.
3627106	3628447	Oh, so they don't tell you what the movie is.
3628467	3629568	They don't tell me what the movie is.
3630289	3633111	You should go see it just to poop on it.
3633191	3640156	No, because Nellie's like, if you leave me with the baby all night long to go see Smurfs the movie, I'm going to kill you.
3640897	3641997	That's fair.
3642017	3642698	That is fair.
3644199	3645580	Sniper Elite Sniper Elite Sniper Elite
3664537	3682828	Okay, not to get too tangenty, but I've had not one, but several friends tell me that the Smurf Village game on the phone, iPhone, which is by Capcom, is actually really good for the whole, like, we rule Farmville-y, you know, Facebook-y type of game on your phone.
3682888	3684328	No, I'm not touching that game.
3684529	3686710	I saw it, I was like, you know, I could download it for free.
3687190	3689070	and check it out and see if it's any good.
3689450	3691771	No, I'm not even going to check it out to see if it's any good.
3691811	3692191	I'm sorry.
3692471	3697072	The only Smurfs game I've played and will only play is the one on the ColecoVision.
3697092	3698032	Yeah, absolutely.
3698212	3699592	That's the one where you can get her naked.
3700133	3700873	Smurfette naked.
3701293	3701833	There's a bug.
3702033	3708914	You go backwards or something instead of going forwards at the very end and there's a bug where Smurfette gets naked.
3709034	3709854	I have this game.
3710595	3710855	Really?
3711235	3712575	I have a ColecoVision in the game.
3713015	3717018	I played Smurfs when I was like 4 or 5 years old.
3717078	3718379	I was a huge fan of the Smurfs.
3718479	3719980	I have to tell you this.
3720320	3727025	Becky just told me Julian and I saw the preview for Yogi Bear and he said it looked stupid and he's 3 and a half.
3729327	3731949	I think Julian should be the official movie critic of Orange Lounge Radio.
3731989	3732629	What do you think?
3732829	3733470	I agree.
3733570	3735411	He's the official child of Orange Lounge Radio.
3735431	3738653	During Tron, they're going to have the new Transformers 3 trailers.
3738673	3740475	That would be interesting.
3741680	3742181	Um, okay.
3742721	3745182	This other game coming out, uh, Touchmaster... Wait, wait, hold on.
3745222	3745723	Sorry, sorry.
3745823	3746983	This is really important, though, okay?
3747524	3749585	Uh, it was on the Atari 2600 and the ColecoVision.
3749845	3754628	The ColecoVision version of Smurf, Rescue, and Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg or programming error.
3754988	3758730	Upon reaching Smurfette's screen, the player can return to the previous screen.
3759070	3760571	Just before the screen changes...
3760911	3765716	It will appear as though the top of Smurfette's dress comes off, making her appear topless.
3766197	3768939	Two of the background music tracks are simple, you know, whatever.
3768980	3769760	Who cares about the music?
3769800	3772183	So yeah, Smurfette gets topless if you go backwards.
3772243	3774986	If you leave her ass, she'll show her titties to get you to come back.
3776067	3778089	Awesome.
3778649	3779130	Sorry, Loki.
3779670	3780371	It was worth reporting.
3780391	3781472	Yeah, it was worth reporting.
3781492	3782934	You know when she made She Was Evil?
3784253	3798843	Touchmaster Connect it's all those wonderful bar games that they have what makes it unique compared to some of the other ones you can share your scores via Twitter and Facebook using this DS title so that's kind of neat I guess Yu-Gi-Oh!
3799364	3811412	50s Dual Transfer coming out on the Wii and how can we not forget World of Warcraft Cataclysm the new expansion coming out on PC what did Nick say DarkSakura?
3811572	3812393	Haters gonna hate
3812933	3813834	No barfing over there.
3814734	3816895	Also, let's see.
3818176	3821898	Bejeweled 3 on PC is pretty awesome.
3822218	3828782	New You Fitness, First Yoga and Pilates on the Wii.
3829062	3830323	Sorry, I must have had something in my throat there.
3830863	3834945	And then finally, a week from today, Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition for the Wii.
3835165	3837106	It's just a Super Nintendo game!
3837206	3839328	Seriously, are you going to pay Nintendo?
3839688	3842829	They did nothing to the game other than make it work with the controls.
3844030	3846131	And you're going to pay them $30?
3850273	3850714	Alright.
3852074	3853075	If that's what you really want.
3853315	3855036	But it comes in a shiny box.
3855056	3857077	You know what kind of a message you're sending Nintendo?
3857237	3858818	We'll buy anything that you sell!
3859645	3863528	and then it's going to be remade in 3D and be $35 on the 3DS.
3863648	3863888	Wait.
3864629	3865189	Wait for it.
3866350	3867931	There's better ROM hacks out there.
3868051	3868612	I mean, what was it?
3868672	3869833	New Super Mario Bros.
3869853	3869833	3.
3869993	3870713	Remember that?
3870773	3876218	The whole, they completely re-edited the levels for the DS version to Super Mario Bros.
3876238	3878960	3 and bonus levels and added all these challenge maps and stuff.
3879200	3880661	See, that's a value right there.
3880681	3885024	If they put that on a cartridge, I'd buy that shit in no time, but I'm sorry.
3885284	3885945	They did nothing.
3885985	3887246	They didn't even try to make it
3887446	3888547	Zuma Blitz Zuma Blitz
3903525	3920628	um it's actually pretty good uh it's pretty addicting and you know it's free they have their whole like you can buy things to unlock more special blah blah blahs but as far as the whole like competing with your friends for high scores and so on you know it's it's it's cool it's just like the bejeweled one
3920828	3921968	Or here's something even better.
3922129	3927271	And yes, I know that the stuff is already available on the virtual console and stuff like that.
3927791	3928191	Why?
3928671	3930032	I mean, they've got a whole damn disc.
3930532	3935374	I can tell you right now this image of this disc is probably going to be like a few megs and that's it.
3935394	3937995	And the rest is just all blank space or filler or whatever.
3938395	3941096	I mean, why didn't they put like...
3941776	3944158	Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2 on there.
3945059	3946480	Maybe Mario 64.
3947061	3948322	Make it worthwhile.
3948362	3951825	And hell, you could even charge 50 bucks for it at that point.
3952205	3954747	Because it's full of all the Mario games.
3956349	3957790	But no, it's just Mario All-Stars.
3958266	3959387	Maybe there's an unlockable.
3959667	3961488	No, there's not an unlockable.
3961848	3965109	Yeah, there'll be an unlockable, all right, and guess what it'll be?
3965129	3965950	Demos.
3967411	3968511	Virtual console demos.
3968671	3969712	Hey, you like these games?
3969732	3971613	You can get them in their original form on the virtual console.
3973863	3975264	Anything else for this week, Loki?
3999516	4015084	on the PlayStation 3, also Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, price reduction on End of Eternity, a game called Free Free Bowling, which I'm thinking is the Move bowling game localized for Japan, and a USB Neo Geo pad from SNK Play More comes out this week.
4015505	4023129	It is basically a Neo Geo pad with six buttons for fighting games, probably for use with some of the Neo Geo games that are on PlayStation Network.
4024529	4030133	Going over to the Nintendo Wii this week in Japan, Donkey Kong Returns makes its way out.
4031534	4033595	For once, we got a game about a week before they did.
4034055	4046243	Fitness Party also comes out from Namco Bandai, and a karaoke game called Karaoke Joy Sound Wii Super DX Hitori de Mina de Utai Hodai comes out from Hudson this week.
4046583	4048164	That is a hell of a name there.
4049099	4050780	The name doesn't quite make sense to me.
4051320	4052621	Hitori de Mina?
4052681	4054682	That's like... Okay.
4054902	4062946	It looks a little bit like Karaoke Revolution meets once in a while the actual music video, but otherwise it's party girls dancing on a stage.
4063446	4066088	Like, I don't even... I can't even... Is there para para?
4066868	4067709	There's no para para.
4068469	4068849	Not worth it.
4069249	4070290	How about Pac-Man Party?
4070350	4071951	That is also coming out in Japan this week.
4072091	4074332	And Boom Blox gets a price reduction in Japan.
4074412	4074672	Oops!
4074872	4075933	Sorry, that's the 16th.
4075973	4076533	That's next week.
4076753	4076973	Sorry.
4078254	4080676	So let me keep going with this week on the Nintendo DS.
4081116	4085160	Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow gets a price reduction, so does Ganbare Goemon.
4085560	4089023	As far as new games, though, one of the ones you might want to check out is Ni no Kuni.
4089423	4092946	Shikoku no Madoushi comes out this week.
4093186	4100833	This is an RPG from level 5, and damn it, I think this is out here in the U.S.
4100873	4102354	is something else, and I can't tell what it is.
4104076	4111071	but it's an RPG from level 5 in Japan I'm sure somebody in the chat room will correct me soon enough there's actually an official website for it should I look at it real quick?
4112338	4113938	I think this is a pretty big DS title.
4115019	4116279	Maybe somebody in chat knows the rest.
4116719	4126962	As far as the Sony PSP goes, not a lot of big stuff this week, although there's some price reductions on things like Valkyria Chronicles 2 and Kurogani no Line Barrels Hudson the Best.
4127602	4129003	Oh, you know what this game is?
4130343	4134224	I believe this is the DS game that's made with Studio Ghibli.
4134844	4135685	That's what this is.
4136165	4139066	Because the artwork looks very... very...
4140886	4141346	Like that.
4141466	4142387	I think that's what this is.
4143107	4145608	So I don't think it is out here in the US, but I think I've read about it.
4145628	4146768	That's why it sounds familiar to me.
4147069	4147529	Yeah, look at it.
4147569	4148849	This looks like Studio Ghibli, doesn't it?
4149690	4150170	Yeah, it is.
4150230	4152831	With a little guy with a lantern on his nose and everything.
4153111	4154051	That's got to be what this is.
4155152	4156852	No other studio puts lanterns on their nose.
4156872	4158193	No, no other studio would do that.
4159284	4159724	There we go.
4159805	4160145	Thank you.
4160205	4162887	Chat room's jumping in there saying yes to Studio Ghibli.
4162907	4166030	It's the one with the huge 300-page magic book, says Dungeon Buster.
4166470	4166771	Thank you.
4166991	4168112	I figured it out eventually.
4168132	4168832	All right.
4169113	4170314	DarkSakura, how about the UK?
4171505	4174726	In the UK, we have a number of games, although not many.
4175467	4181149	On the 7th is Alien Breed 2 Assault and Bejeweled 3 and World of Warcraft Cataclysm.
4181289	4181549	Sorry.
4182530	4182910	I'm not.
4183410	4185651	On the 8th is Bomberman Live Battlefest.
4186351	4191213	And then on the 10th, we have Cave Story and Golden Sun, Dark Dawn.
4192934	4192994	Ooh.
4196044	4222068	and that's about it alright not a bad week all things considered I mean considering we're getting really close to Christmas I mean whether DarkSakura likes it or not Warcraft's gonna be a huge game and hey there's Tron and there's I don't give a crap about Warcraft Warcraft I mean to be honest I just do it to give you a hard time there's Plants vs. Zombies is in it now that's all I'm saying I just like giving you a hard time about it I know you do mwah mwah mwah
4223489	4251228	a couple more new stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week yes so this is kind of cool you know and they were talking about possibly making a game based on this but now it's been confirmed that Christopher Nolan is actually working on an Inception video game and I think that's really cool love the world of Inception love the movie I still haven't seen it oh
4252029	4254111	But it comes out on Blu-ray this week, so I plan to rent it.
4254371	4254871	Absolutely.
4255252	4255632	Absolutely.
4255672	4256493	Do not watch anything else.
4256533	4264380	Because I'm sitting here going, all I know is that there's a room spinny thing that might be cool in a video game, but otherwise I don't know why this would make a good video game.
4264641	4267363	Can you tell me why this is going to be an awesome video game without spoiling the movie?
4268064	4268824	Okay.
4268905	4272248	Think of it, it's like, it'd be like why the...
4274226	4277387	Except the MMO sucked, like The Matrix.
4277607	4279007	Why The Matrix was kind of a cool movie.
4279567	4281828	It's really the environment of it and everything.
4282248	4283748	It's just a really neat concept.
4283848	4288969	The Matrix game that was on GameCube and PS2 was not as terrible as I think some made it out to be.
4288989	4289950	Let me put it this way.
4290450	4294131	Inception has that vibe of the first Matrix movie.
4294171	4295131	They set up a world.
4295571	4296071	It's kind of...
4296731	4297751	Thanks for watching!
4325476	4325776	Hmm.
4326057	4326537	Interesting.
4326557	4328158	That's the kid from Third Rock from the Sun.
4328539	4332241	Or he was also the kid in Dark Shadows years and years ago.
4332442	4333703	Did you ever see the movie Brick?
4335164	4336064	You need to see Brick.
4336185	4337025	No, I haven't seen Brick.
4337065	4340608	But he was in some other movie I saw called Mysterious Skin.
4341249	4342329	And I kind of felt dirty.
4342369	4344171	I was like, this is the guy from Third Rock?
4344411	4345492	He's a really good actor nowadays.
4345512	4346213	He's a pretty good actor.
4346493	4350738	I think Mysterious Skin was by the guy, and he does all these messed up teen angst movies.
4350778	4356664	He did like the Nowhere, I think was one, and was totally fucked up, and there's another one in that whole series.
4357645	4359547	All those teen angst movies, and he did that too.
4360327	4362068	Yeah, so he's an awesome character.
4362448	4364209	He plays a really awesome character in the movie.
4364369	4366290	And then, of course, DiCaprio's alright.
4367850	4372752	But, yeah, seriously, the movie Brick, though, it's a film noir set in a high school.
4373873	4374793	In modern-day high school.
4375233	4376774	It's really awesome.
4376794	4378895	All the dialogue, though, is film noir.
4380276	4381477	It's just so badass.
4381958	4383299	You gotta see it.
4383340	4384101	It's really cool.
4384601	4385222	I'll take your word for it.
4385462	4387545	Inception, amazing movie.
4388066	4393392	So the video game, you know, games based off movies aren't that great all the time.
4393793	4396817	But if Christopher Nolan's actually working on it, maybe it'll...
4398258	4398778	Do all right.
4399858	4413242	Basically, he says now he was considering putting together a video game based on the movie, but it looks like his plans are going a little bit further than that.
4413262	4422584	He says he's told Entertainment Weekly that the project is a go and that he's working with a full team on the game as a longer-term proposition.
4423584	4428528	He's excited to explore the medium of gaming by creating a new story set in the world of the movie.
4429949	4435373	Entertainment Weekly suggests an MMO, but hopefully it's something better than that.
4437995	4438516	Interesting.
4438636	4445221	I could see an MMO, but the problem I see with an MMO, though, is that you remember the Matrix Online.
4445461	4447423	The Matrix Online just had some flaws.
4447443	4449805	The Matrix could have made an awesome MMO.
4450425	4452687	It's just that what they released wasn't it.
4453075	4455637	Just like the Wachowski brothers could have made an awesome trilogy.
4456458	4459321	But they're like, let's give you all these powers all of a sudden.
4460162	4461002	Oh, he's too powerful.
4461022	4463445	To this day, I've never seen the third movie.
4463985	4465707	To this day, I've never seen the third movie.
4466141	4466921	You're not missing much.
4466981	4470682	It has an ending reminiscent of Highlander 2, which was also a crappy movie.
4470802	4471442	That's what I hear.
4471882	4474223	Wait, but didn't Highlander 2, wasn't that the one that introduced Sean Connery?
4474423	4475643	Or was he in the first one too, and I just forgot?
4475663	4476123	The first one.
4476504	4477664	Dude, he was Ramirez.
4478124	4478584	I forgot.
4478664	4480565	You know how many years it's been since I've seen Highlander?
4481065	4483705	That was like in college, where everybody got high and watched Highlander.
4483765	4486726	But I didn't, because I'm... It's called Highlander, man.
4486746	4488446	You gotta watch it high.
4490487	4492007	I went to Chico State, folks.
4492067	4492668	Enough said.
4493048	4493688	Enough said.
4495100	4495921	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4520638	4521199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4542739	4543500	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4563015	4577003	There is the possibility there that there will be interactive elements into shows viewed on the console and that there'll be also content silos, meaning that like HBO and Showtime could have their own little areas to subscribe to.
4577524	4578904	So could be interesting.
4579705	4584468	I like this because remember when I talked about the whole 1 versus 100 getting canceled, I was like...
4585288	4588751	Why doesn't Xbox make more of a network?
4588791	4589872	I was kind of talking about this.
4589992	4595197	I like this whole idea of interactivity or more interactive shows.
4595697	4605065	I think Xbox had a great thing with 1 vs. 100 and it's a damn shame that they lost the rights to the new Game Show Network version or whatever the hell it is that's going on.
4605386	4609069	Which, by the way, have you seen the new Game Show Network version with Carrie Ann Inaba as the host?
4609089	4609129	No.
4609529	4612811	Yeah, it's not as fun as it was on Xbox Live, sorry to say.
4614673	4616234	I'm actually really into something like this.
4616394	4618695	I just hope the interactive stuff isn't cheesy.
4619136	4627501	You see a lot of Blu-ray discs that have the interactive movie component, which is just asking dumb poll questions and things.
4627601	4631144	I would like to see them do more interactive game shows.
4631424	4635487	We've had the rumor of a Poker Night game that's apparently in top secret testing right now.
4636087	4638629	I mean, maybe there's a show to be made of that?
4638869	4639389	I don't know.
4641090	4642870	What if you could vote on the ending?
4643711	4646072	Vote on a character getting killed off or what have you.
4646432	4648852	American Idol being voted on through your Xbox.
4648913	4650513	X Factor on Xbox.
4650553	4656935	I would think if anything what the interactive part might be is like marking clips or something like that and sharing them with friends.
4657475	4658556	Say, hey, have you seen this?
4658616	4659416	This is pretty cool.
4660517	4661717	Hey, look, it's a nipple slip.
4665307	4668669	Wait, so you think this is more like a TiVo that you could share?
4669089	4675173	So if there's ever another Janet Jackson boobie that slips out, people could be like, hey, I saw this awesome clip and wanted to share it with my friends.
4675273	4681157	Well, it's like, I guess, Justin TV, where you can save clips and stuff like that.
4681217	4683839	Oh, God, I hope we're not going to be lifecasting through our Xbox.
4683859	4685239	There's certain people I don't want...
4686320	4687481	to see their lives.
4688001	4692764	I mean, the Kinect is putting a camera in all of our homes, but this is not an idea I like.
4693185	4708455	Although, oh my God, could you imagine like now when they do one versus a hundred, like with two and a half million Kinects out there and growing, they could have the one be on TV with the whole Kinect thing, which is a nice little camera in your house.
4710296	4710456	Yeah.
4710636	4711437	It's alive.
4711457	4711537	Yeah.
4715242	4719146	And then the Xbox 720 will just be called Skynet.
4720367	4722129	That's where we go from here, right?
4724871	4729415	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to chime in on this live with us.
4730196	4733459	Well, isn't Sky a service that's in the UK?
4733860	4735221	And technically, isn't it a network?
4738294	4739435	Have you seen this boy?
4740496	4744340	Ezam in our chatroom says, that's the new show on Current TV, Bar Karma.
4744740	4746982	Viewers make the story and they produce it.
4747142	4748123	Now, here's a question.
4748143	4749264	This is totally random.
4749885	4756751	And they've got to have this, like some sort of Photoshopped, you know, have you seen this boy with Pedobear?
4757752	4759313	I'm sure it exists somewhere.
4759333	4759914	That'd be funny.
4760214	4760855	Absolutely.
4763461	4765742	Let's see, the name that I can never pronounce.
4765862	4769905	Majinamicon in our chatroom says, DC figured out a way to capitalize on this.
4769945	4773366	They announced a telephone poll for readers to decide whether he lived or died.
4773386	4773807	Jason Todd.
4774087	4776448	Yep, 10,000 votes later, he was dead.
4776688	4777849	Everyone hated Jason Todd.
4779350	4780170	And guess what?
4780390	4780951	He's live again.
4781351	4781732	You know what?
4781772	4785375	They did that in the 70s with Andy Kaufman on Saturday Night Live.
4785795	4787637	So I don't know if that's really... Remember?
4788057	4790179	Well, I know none of you were alive when this happened.
4790199	4790919	I remember that.
4790939	4793181	Like it was 10 years before I was born.
4794102	4795503	Wasn't in the Man on the Moon movie?
4795583	4795944	I don't know.
4795984	4801228	But they did a whole viewer poll thing to banish Andy Kaufman from Saturday Night Live.
4801288	4802129	And he was banished.
4802449	4803310	Or I remember...
4805501	4835050	I'm gonna really date myself and make myself super lame here but I don't give a fuck alright do you remember I'm Married With Children they had a night where you could vote on the ending if Al Bundy was going to actually tell Peg he loved her or not like it was a whole I think it was for Valentine's Day and you could actually call in and vote on the ending where if Al Bundy is gonna say I love you Peg or just go to bed without saying it cause the whole episode was about Peg was whining oh Al
4838359	4842231	You never say I love you to me or whatever was the whole plot.
4842291	4843795	God, that was such a great show.
4843876	4844397	I'm sorry.
4846505	4848086	But they had an interactive episode.
4848146	4848747	So, you know.
4849848	4850268	Did they?
4851549	4852951	From what I remember, yes.
4853111	4854432	He said, I love you at the end of the night.
4854692	4855713	I know.
4855733	4856714	It was all the women voting.
4857314	4860036	But anyway.
4860056	4861137	I had to give you beer more often.
4862098	4865221	I said that to get a reaction out of DarkSakura and didn't really get one.
4865301	4866522	I gave him a look.
4866702	4868003	I did get side-eye a little bit.
4868063	4869264	It doesn't transfer well to radio.
4869284	4870045	You know side-eye like
4872532	4872892	Anyway.
4873653	4874593	Rob gets a snort.
4875854	4876835	I don't remember what I was saying.
4876855	4877995	I'm too busy looking at gay.
4878216	4882958	I also remember an episode of You Can't Do That on television where you could vote, but that wasn't real.
4884279	4885100	I remember.
4885120	4886501	I'm really dating myself tonight.
4886521	4889102	That does not compute episode where they used gray slime.
4889442	4889943	Thank God.
4890083	4892404	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says, I remember this.
4892484	4893725	Thank God it's not just me.
4896761	4898002	I grew up unmarried with children.
4898042	4898643	That was my show.
4898723	4899023	All right.
4899504	4907753	Speaking of blasts from the past, we like to do a segment here on the show where DarkSakura digs through the archives of gaming and finds a game that she says, Hey.
4909174	4910055	Hey, you.
4910876	4911717	Hey, listen.
4911817	4912818	Get off my lawn.
4913098	4914159	Oh, Al.
4914560	4916822	I found the gayest game ever.
4917062	4918104	Oh, Dan.
4920339	4921919	You should play this game.
4921979	4925340	I've been trying to get him to download it for me and he won't do it out of pure principle.
4925380	4926821	So somebody needs to get it for me.
4927261	4929902	All right, DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4930182	4931122	Cho Aniki.
4931962	4935383	Like I said, gayest game ever.
4935603	4937524	I'm kind of sad that I asked, but here you go.
4938522	4942143	Seriously, when I told Rob I was picking it, he replied with LOL Gay.
4943583	4947704	So, Jovani Key, it means Super Big Brother.
4947904	4952745	It's a game series done by Masaya and published by NSC Corp.
4953526	4959327	It came out in 1992 for the PC Engine with lots of spin-offs and sequels and other versions.
4960348	4972979	it's a mostly most versions are side-scrolling shoot-em-up plays kind of like Gradius we did get Cho Aniki on virtual console and somebody needs to give it to me
4974499	4976461	I've actually still been looking for a huge part of this.
4976541	4979122	I would love to have a copy of Cho Aniki.
4980743	4995954	So yeah, to start with the first game, the plot has the heroes, who are these big buff muscle-bound men in speedos, going through different areas, space, ruins, cities, fighting alien invaders.
4997034	5003058	And Bo Emperor Bill, which is Bo Tebiru, which is supposed to be short of bodybuild.
5006160	5015926	is basically a man who achieved 10 consecutive victories in the Great Galaxy Bodybuilding Contest is facing an ever-decreasing supply of protein.
5016846	5020688	So he's invading other star systems to establish protein factories.
5021289	5022709	And so... Wow!
5023510	5029253	The Heaven Realms sent Ida Ten and Ben Ten to take over Bo Emperor Bill.
5029913	5032535	And so it's a sweaty, hot muscle battle.
5033856	5034116	Yes.
5036438	5045566	But the main characters actually in this one was Ita Den was just a pretty guy and Benten who was a girl with blue hair.
5046387	5051672	And then you have the Musclebound Men, Samson and Adon who are the Musclebound Men in Speedos.
5052332	5055535	And they hover around and they are the brothers.
5056756	5059601	So, yeah.
5060042	5060622	It's weird.
5060703	5066131	Basically, the whole genre of games that these are in are what's called, they're very kitschy.
5066732	5070959	They're called bakage, which is like idiot game.
5072040	5072500	DarkSakura.com
5092012	5092973	and Fairly Neat.
5093613	5097115	It's not really pornographic, just gay.
5097876	5098776	Gay!
5100617	5104539	And the rights to the series are now actually owned by Xtreme Co.
5104980	5105080	Ltd.
5105891	5106892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5126032	5149073	and in this one you fight the you actually have to raise the Neo Builder army um well the the bad guy is a name is uh Bote Kon Shiasu which is body conscious it's a pun to fight Ida-Ten and Ben-Ten and um they uh fall in love in a lope so uh Samson and Adon have to fight and uh it's
5150919	5153663	Yeah, it came out on Virtual Console Japan in 2007.
5153803	5159410	Cho Aniki, Bakuretsu Ranto-hen, which is a different one.
5159451	5160051	It's a fighting game.
5160532	5163556	You have Idaten, Benten, Samson, and Adon.
5163976	5165939	They attack by gyrating and flatulating.
5165959	5166900	Okay.
5167801	5196800	Sabu, who is a pagoda-shaped ship with Elvis Presley on the top Mami19, who is a cute girl mixed with a battleship transporting three naked, frolicking men Adam, who is actually Adam from The Creation who is half-naked and riding on the moon Bote, who is the guy from the first game and Uminin, who is a latex creature that looks like a condom
5198971	5206657	Cho Ainiki, Kyuukyoku, Meteki Ginga Saikyo Otoko
5222108	5225010	Um, yeah, it's still weird.
5225671	5230076	Um, it's actually available for download on PlayStation Network, uh, in North America.
5231157	5232658	So, get it, and then send it to me.
5233179	5238104	And then we also have the WonderSwan, uh, version, Cho Aineki Otoko no Tamahuda.
5239045	5239125	Um...
5240946	5244951	It's actually... I've explained what Hanafuda is before, haven't I?
5245431	5245892	I think so.
5245912	5247813	Nintendo started off as a Hanafuda company.
5247914	5248574	It's playing cards.
5248674	5249575	It's a type of playing card game.
5249856	5250016	Right.
5250296	5254620	Sorry, I just wanted to... I switched the music to the ending from the PC Engine version because I wanted to see it.
5254881	5255161	Okay.
5255481	5255942	So, sorry.
5256202	5256542	That's okay.
5257223	5262328	But it's actually a portmanteau of Tamashii, which is soul, and Hanafuda, which is a card game.
5262929	5263770	So it's like...
5265477	5265797	Tama Balls
5278206	5286909	Oh no, I was going to say, you know what's funny is that obviously I know of this game because I've been doing this show for a while and how can you not know about this game?
5287409	5290390	But I've never played it, believe it or not.
5290490	5291450	I've never played this game.
5293191	5296792	It looks like I just kind of look at it with a raised eyebrow going, what?
5297892	5299032	Which I'm sure is what most people do.
5299693	5300613	And it's probably the point.
5301147	5310772	Okay, well, the last one on my list is Cho Aineke, Senaru Protein Densetsu, which is Legend of the Holy Protein.
5312293	5315215	And it's done by the group that did Sengoku Blade.
5315595	5316876	Holy Protein Batman.
5317596	5319597	I'm just going to read exactly what's on the article.
5319697	5326161	The plot of the game centers on the holy protein, a deity-like glob of what may be semen.
5327808	5332170	Samson and Adon hover around the glob, absorbing enemy fire as they did in the previous game.
5333431	5335252	Yeah.
5336993	5337673	Yeah.
5337813	5346818	And it has a Mona Lisa painting that fires lasers from its eyes, and a giant cross-dressing man in a maid outfit.
5347458	5348378	So, yeah.
5348458	5352360	And then there was Choaniki Zero, which came out by Extreme Co.
5352380	5352720	Ltd.
5353681	5353821	And...
5356222	5364786	The whole thing with Cho Aineke is that it's so completely freaking nuts that you can't help but love it.
5364886	5372950	I mean, there's actually... Masaya made a game called... Well, a series called Langrisser, which I've played a few of those games.
5374270	5376931	But Samson and all of them are in it.
5377072	5379112	You have to go to the Muscle Shrine where you fight Samson.
5380133	5381574	And then you can use the Aineke summon.
5381774	5381974	Yeah.
5382934	5388378	It's on the Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, and PlayStation versions, which I've played the Super Nintendo one.
5389739	5398405	Capcom game God Hand makes fun of Samson and Add-On as powerless yet flamboyant drag queens, who are the first bosses in the game.
5398825	5399125	Wow.
5399526	5399766	Yeah.
5400650	5410114	Um, they, they have, uh, Samson and Adlon have a weapon called Men's Beam, which is white energy from holes in their head.
5410374	5410874	Wow.
5411775	5412275	Yeah.
5412895	5414456	It's just, it's gay.
5416076	5420918	And I, I'm saying this, it's gay.
5422779	5426841	Like, I don't really think it's gay as in homosexual, it's more like gay as in, um, Christmas.
5427221	5427641	Christmas.
5429286	5441969	I think that it's full of penis references and naked men in speedos and drag queens I don't remember playing it maybe I did and I just blocked it from my mind Yeah, I'm not so sure I think I might use the word what
5461162	5461762	I won it.
5462843	5463123	All right.
5464183	5466484	Anyhow, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5466904	5470946	If DarkSakura's all finished over there, Cho Aniki on various systems.
5470966	5471406	Super Big Brother.
5472747	5474087	Various systems.
5474127	5478829	And honestly, Rob, after I've played, I've played like a couple of them.
5479329	5480430	They're actually really fun.
5480450	5483371	But it's so bizarre.
5483951	5487213	And I just mean, you can't help but laugh and be happy while you're playing it.
5487753	5488593	Because it's naked.
5488613	5489634	Well, then it is gay.
5489734	5490514	Because gay means happy.
5491918	5494340	And I wasn't meaning like... I know, I know.
5494361	5494981	You know what I mean.
5495121	5495622	I know what you mean.
5495702	5497383	It's just, it was, it's gorgeous.
5497503	5501768	It's like, it's, it's beautiful.
5503089	5503509	Penis.
5507012	5507173	I'm 12.
5507633	5511156	I'm going to need to crop that and add that to the soundboard at some point.
5511537	5512738	All right, just messing.
5512967	5514948	All right, we're going to take a break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5514968	5515588	We'll be right back.
5515628	5521390	Your Twitter topics, and God, you saw what came last week and what that became, so who knows what's on the Twitter this week.
5521430	5523430	So get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.
5524031	5527032	We're going to also get to the mailbag, and we're going to talk about some other news stories.
5527392	5530553	We're going to talk about some goings-on in Xbox Live Arcade.
5530853	5534034	We're going to talk about the future of arcade games in another country.
5534554	5546702	and we're going to talk about a game that is being pirated that's doing something kind of lulzy especially if you're DarkSakura you're going to find this pretty lulzy so we'll be back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio
5552441	5557904	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has a voice.
5557964	5566528	We are taping live our 392nd episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 5th, right, of 2010.
5566909	5567769	I lost track of time.
5568209	5569870	Only 20 shopping days left.
5570030	5571091	Actually, no, not even that many.
5571691	5571091	19.
5571711	5572091	Uh-oh.
5573012	5573272	Oh well.
5573732	5577254	Anyhow, this is the part of the show where we like to welcome you guys back.
5595205	5595946	Duke Nukem Forever Earlier
5616303	5619124	True, but that's also more money.
5619284	5622085	Like $18 to see if I... Because I don't know if I'm going to like it or not.
5622105	5622785	You're going to love it.
5622925	5623345	Seriously.
5623365	5623685	You think?
5623705	5624325	All right, we'll see.
5624385	5624705	We'll see.
5625126	5627526	But then I'm also like, well, shit, Cataclysm's coming out this week.
5627546	5629167	Or you could borrow my copy.
5629347	5630527	I like that idea.
5631667	5643051	Well, then also there's always the whole like, I could just play it on Alan's computer, but we always get distracted because like, oh, but we really need to run a raid and wow, oh boy, we really need to go out and drink or whatever we're doing.
5643471	5643611	So...
5644784	5649624	Anyhow, have either of you guys been to the stores and looked at deals before?
5649884	5652005	Well, I didn't specifically go shopping.
5652385	5656106	When Marissa was here, we went over to the Art and Fair Mall.
5656626	5661428	And we just walked and looked at stuff, and I popped into Forever 21 and looked at jackets.
5662728	5665089	Because I like some of the clothes there.
5665109	5666710	I wouldn't wear all of it, but I like some of it.
5666730	5669251	Was it a freaking madhouse, though, like the rest of the mall seemed to be?
5669271	5671431	Yeah, it was kind of crazy, but not so bad.
5671471	5674592	I mean, I went into... You see... Wait, I did buy something.
5674632	5675153	Oh, it's not in here.
5675573	5676033	I bought this...
5676553	5677053	Look how I bounce!
5706138	5707742	But you were looking at Pyramid Head on your shirt.
5708163	5708604	Peahitty.
5709607	5711852	That shirt is special to me.
5713208	5713608	DarkSakura.com
5736906	5740733	All this month we'll be having a special which is our year-end review of comics.
5749025	5750406	Oh boy, so now you know what you gotta catch up on.
5750426	5753587	You get to see how much we are PO'd with Matt Fraction.
5753868	5755408	Alright, now do you remember the show I do?
5755749	5756789	I plugged your show, you remember my show?
5757149	5760411	Uh, the one with Dolly Parton and her boobs.
5760531	5760851	Oh, sorry.
5761372	5766194	It's Best Little Horde House in whatever fucking planet that is.
5766274	5766894	Azeroth, yes.
5766995	5767415	Azeroth.
5768686	5770287	Yeah, okay.
5770487	5773889	But yeah, you're cute, you and Extifer.
5774570	5775090	You're adorable.
5775130	5776391	We had a fun show this week, actually.
5776411	5777132	We had a special guest.
5777472	5786678	Frat Matt is what I call him online, but Grandpa Warcraft is what we were calling him because he's been playing, and you know Matt, he's been playing Warcraft since Vanilla, so we were calling him Grandpa Warcraft.
5786758	5787238	It was a good show.
5787378	5788039	Wow.
5788199	5789760	I have absolutely no idea what that means.
5790347	5791729	He's old and he plays Warcraft.
5791929	5792429	That's what it means.
5793110	5797134	And also, we have a huge show planned.
5797194	5797755	It's not really.
5798015	5799016	We're just doing the same old show.
5799056	5800178	But it is Cataclysm.
5800258	5802400	The third expansion of WoW does come out this week.
5802440	5803201	It's a pretty big deal.
5803581	5804843	So we're going to talk a lot about that.
5804863	5805203	Oh my god!
5805243	5806024	Plants vs. Zombies!
5806044	5806504	Cataclysm!
5806745	5806805	Ah!
5807486	5808607	Splooge, splooge, splooge.
5808787	5809028	Yeah.
5809328	5813534	The sad thing is it goes live at midnight tomorrow and I gotta go to bed because of work.
5813874	5815176	I can't stay up and play WoW.
5815436	5819862	And then Tuesday, I have to go bake cookies because there's this whole cookie party.
5819902	5821625	Yes, there is a cookie party going on at work.
5821845	5822646	Cookie party!
5822846	5823507	Cookie party!
5827865	5828826	That's why the show got canceled.
5828846	5834088	That was the best part of the Sarah Silverman show was Cookie Party with what was the host name?
5834168	5836290	Miss something on Cookie Party.
5836470	5836930	Forget it.
5837930	5840932	All the listeners at home are like, I thought this was a video game podcast.
5841012	5842853	I don't know what's going on at all.
5843833	5848036	Anyhow, let's do some rapid fire news and remind them that it is a game podcast.
5848096	5848956	Loki, what do you got for us?
5848976	5850257	By the way, Twitter, last chance.
5850297	5852278	Twitter.com slash OLR for Twitter topics tonight.
5852518	5854040	Yes, cool stuff.
5855020	5867973	You may remember that Ghostbusters, a game that came out almost a year and a half ago, there was a few achievements that were unable to be achieved, I guess, because the game was broken.
5868753	5886425	and well, apparently they have actually just put through Xbox Live certification the update that will fix those and I guess these now four achievements that were unable to be unlocked before are being fixed.
5886825	5892369	So that's kind of cool that they're actually still working on patches for games despite the fact that they came out a long time ago.
5893089	5894410	So, neat.
5894730	5896931	Ghostbusters, Sanctimus Slime, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and PC
5916660	5918641	Kind of a top-down action game.
5919262	5924744	And they're saying that it's being developed by the Assault Heroes creator, Wanako.
5925325	5935249	And it's a four-player online and local co-op top-down action game that's going to not really have any of the voice actors because those are expensive.
5936090	5944794	And they're not really sure if the characters from the movie, obviously, are going to be there or they're going to be replaced by a new team or something like that.
5945715	5962738	um but yeah it's uh pretty awesome looking actually from some of the screenshots that they had so I'll be coming sometime soon next year uh Gameloft is announcing some new games they actually had some pretty decent ones when they're not ripping off other games um
5964404	5964665	Nice.
5964685	5966867	I like how I worked that in there.
5968309	5972554	Nova 2, it's their first person shooter game that's kind of a little bit like Halo.
5973235	5975098	It's inspired, I guess, if you will.
5975378	5976800	But it's actually a pretty solid first person.
5976820	5978822	I thought you said they weren't ripping off other games anymore.
5979603	5981245	Shadow Guardian, New IP for Gameloft,
6005147	6025698	and it's kind of similar to like an Uncharted or Tomb Raider game it's more of like an action adventure game so it looks very Uncharted-esque but you know nice to see some sophisticated games coming to iOS despite the fact Gameloft is really hit or miss with some of this stuff but yeah
6026279	6027561	The original IP stuff's not bad.
6028122	6029805	They're Gangstar or whatever.
6030406	6036117	It's not a bad clone of the old PSP or PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto games.
6038155	6043177	And then, let's see, Def Jam.
6043817	6045118	This is kind of interesting.
6045218	6049020	In the UK, Def Jam is doing their Rapstar game.
6049360	6054502	They're having a competition that offers the winner a record contract.
6055162	6060685	Apparently, they're going to be teaming up, I guess, with Atlantic Records UK.
6061765	6068311	and they're giving one lucky UK resident a chance to have their very own record.
6069152	6087287	And they're going to be employing the game's freestyle mode and contestants will upload their hottest 40 bars, give or take, and they're going to be judged by the Def Jam Rapstar community because they do have a really big community aspect to the game, actually, despite the fact a lot of people don't.
6088007	6088887	I had a chance to get this game.
6088907	6092289	I was going to get it for just the microphone because I got it for free.
6093189	6093870	I actually passed.
6094530	6095050	Wow.
6095610	6096471	It wasn't a bad game.
6096551	6100913	I mean, I don't listen to really the – I mean, maybe there's a couple songs in there I know.
6101093	6101353	Yeah.
6101393	6105575	But it's not the type of game – I can't see myself honestly playing this game.
6105595	6111597	Especially – I live by myself and a lot of my gaming is alone, so I just can't see myself sitting there –
6114933	6117016	Wrapping by myself in my apartment.
6117076	6118739	I mean, there's just something kind of sad.
6121462	6125268	I'm crying all night tonight because I just watched a sad movie.
6125328	6128152	I'll play Def Dam Rapstar to make me feel better.
6129393	6131136	Sip it on gin and juice.
6132938	6159815	it says the top regional finalists will then have to compete in front of a live audience at the UK HMV locations they're saying 8 mile style and that's going to be in February and of course that means that the winner will be able to have the actual record contract see Loki you should be participating in this that's why you need the game yes
6161075	6164117	I bet anything if you were to submit a video, you would be voted as the winner.
6164177	6168799	I don't believe that Sacramento is in the UK.
6169319	6173261	My basic geography knowledge says that's not correct.
6173301	6174182	We need to fix this.
6174282	6175162	Does Kidman rap?
6177883	6178824	Who else is in the UK?
6182591	6183893	How about Ake Ripper?
6184194	6186378	We need some Swedish rappers.
6186418	6187600	Let's get Ake Ripper.
6187721	6189624	Does Sweden count?
6190285	6190686	I don't know.
6191447	6192269	We need to find that out.
6194229	6194789	All right, anyhow.
6194809	6200431	Yeah, I have some news, but whatever.
6200491	6202012	It's just not as cool as Swedish rap.
6202652	6209374	Rock Band Reloaded is now available on the iOS systems, meaning the iPhone, the iPod Touch, the iPad.
6209434	6213896	It's $5 on the phones and phone with no phone and $10 on the iPad.
6214276	6217817	There's a new expert mode and apparently full vocal support.
6218198	6221519	So you could actually sit there and sing along with your phone.
6223080	6228984	Also the iPad version now has split screen multiplayer and several different ways to have the action on screen.
6229004	6231245	You can reorient gameplay if you're a lefty.
6231345	6231926	That's kind of cool.
6232526	6236909	And apparently there's a whole drum kit now that you can kind of have so you can kind of beat your iPad.
6237670	6239031	I guess that's how it works.
6240772	6249881	There are quite a few games available when you initially download it, including Kryptonite, Three Doors Down, So What You Want by Beastie Boys, White Wedding by Billy Idol.
6250101	6251042	God, I love that song.
6251983	6257108	Call Me When You're Sober by Evanescence, The Perfect Drug by Nine Inch Nails, Hella Good by No Doubt.
6257188	6260551	I mean, a lot of these games are sort of in the rock band game anyway.
6260891	6263934	There's also tracks that you can download in the music store.
6264835	6267196	I guess there's some free tracks too in the music store.
6267236	6270257	Of course, they're like indie bands and stuff, but the Acrobats are in there.
6270737	6272398	Daylight and Dollar Short, if you like the Acrobats.
6274618	6278600	A lot of people around the internets were fans of Splosion Man.
6278680	6280720	Remember that game that was on the indie marketplace?
6280740	6281341	Well, guess what?
6281441	6282621	A sequel has been announced.
6283201	6283581	Ms.
6283842	6284862	Splosion Man.
6285442	6286903	I know they're doing like the whole Ms.
6286943	6288063	Pac-Man thing, but seriously.
6288103	6288783	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6305394	6307775	This is a really early announcement, but there it is.
6309555	6320378	The CCO Josh Baer of Twisted Pixel has said, quote, We could have churned out new levels for Splosion Man, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff.
6320678	6322418	But we didn't want to just do Splosion Man 2.
6323038	6324759	It had to be something a little more interesting.
6325059	6326819	That is why we're making Ms.
6327039	6327959	Splosion Man.
6328219	6334121	There's actually a teaser trailer that's out there and everything, and as you can expect, it pays homage to Ms.
6334141	6334501	Pac-Man.
6336075	6339557	World of Warcraft news, but not the kind that gets me excited.
6339598	6340438	Sorry, DarkSakura.
6340798	6345922	World of Warcraft apparently is now streaming and playable on an HTC Desire.
6346562	6352767	Yes, this whole little tech demo that was out there before has now been fully realized, apparently.
6352847	6357050	An HTC Desire smartphone is running World of Warcraft.
6357070	6361993	And I don't know if it's like a streaming thing or what, but there's actually a demo that's out there on YouTube.
6362674	6362814	Um...
6363254	6364015	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6385819	6387120	Well, we have a few things.
6388401	6391483	To start us off with some Kirby.
6391663	6392364	How about Kirby?
6393164	6398768	Kirby's Epic Yarn will be out in 2011 for our European friends on February 25th.
6400109	6401330	I was trying to say 25th.
6401350	6401831	It'll be 25th.
6403812	6408875	So you have to wait, but it's going to be all cool.
6408895	6422164	They have to change it into British English, I guess, so that it can be a duvet instead of a comforter and a lift instead of an elevator and a boot instead of the trunk, that type of thing.
6423324	6448280	and uh new uh characters for Super Street Fighter 4 we have dun dun dun didn't we call it last uh last week Oni Akuma who is like Shin Akuma who is the super evil one and then we have Evil Ryu so that's gonna be super hot because I loved Evil Ryu of course I would love to have Evil Sakura next Dark Sakura
6449521	6453024	And then, for Rock Band, more download content.
6453064	6454065	We get Queen!
6454225	6455326	Finally, finally, finally.
6457387	6462451	It's Rock Band 3 upgraded tracks from Lego Rock Band.
6463492	6468276	So here's what's also going to be in the Queen Extravaganza Pack 1.
6469116	6484373	Hammer to Fall, Keep Yourself Alive, Now I'm Here, Play the Game, Tenement Funster, We Are the Champions, We Will Rock You, and the Queen Rock Band 3 Enhanced Pack, I Want It All, I Want to Break Free, Killer Queen, One Vision, Somebody to Love, and Under Pressure.
6484773	6513945	which also is David Bowie I'm so buying that enhanced pack so am I the first pack is a lot of really kind of like off-cut tracks which I mean Queen is Queen they're cool they threw two big ones in there to kind of make it feel a little more valuable but I definitely want like all my favorite Queen songs are in that other pack so and for some reason this is weird I never bought the Queen track pack in Rock Band originally like I just somehow missed it or I wasn't playing Rock Band at the time like there's already like 15 Queen songs available in there
6514805	6519486	and I really need to get SingStar Queen at some point because I'm sure I can find it really cheap now.
6519886	6522787	Just like SingStar ABBA is on like every Target clearance rack.
6523768	6525028	Really need to get SingStar Queen.
6525888	6528609	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com there's some comments.
6529049	6530549	SSJ100Matt is talking about Ms.
6530629	6531350	Explosion Man.
6531770	6531910	Ms.
6531930	6534690	Explosion Man better have her making a sandwich in the end.
6534831	6535391	Just saying.
6538391	6542693	Tigerclaw says the third one should be Junior Explosion Man or Baby Explosion Man.
6543433	6543573	Hmm.
6544731	6549036	I don't know about Explosion Baby Hey let's go to the tweeter
6559434	6566159	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6567240	6571043	SSJ100 Matt is sending us a story courtesy of Travis Donovan.
6571723	6576206	South Korea is getting ready to set an internet curfew for young teens.
6576887	6577187	Really?
6577247	6578308	I had not heard about this.
6578388	6582611	But then again, I did not listen to USL last night.
6582651	6585193	I was a very... Yeah, on Saturday night.
6585213	6586054	I was a very naughty boy.
6586094	6586434	I was out.
6587135	6588376	But apparently, South Korea...
6589217	6592853	Although I notice I'm being linked to a story from Fox News, so take it from me with the greatest song.
6594597	6602863	South Korea is apparently considering a nationally enforced gaming curfew in an effort to curb internet addiction.
6602883	6606786	Because you know a lot of times we've had those crazy internet addicts story and they all seem to be out of South Korea.
6608087	6619475	Well, apparently it will make it illegal for internet service providers, if this bill is passed, to give online gaming access to users under the age of 16 between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m.
6621365	6623787	For South Korean students, this will mean no gaming at all.
6624167	6628211	It's normal to be in school until midnight due to extracurricular activities and studying.
6628351	6628751	What?
6630313	6630693	Wow.
6632535	6633776	That much study is actually pretty normal.
6635515	6637316	Wow, makes me feel like a lazy asshole.
6637356	6642158	Even though I was doing every extracurricular activity in high school, I was still home by 7 or 8 o'clock.
6642738	6643118	Dang.
6643859	6646160	Alright, well, interesting.
6647180	6648981	What do you guys think about this ban?
6649001	6651622	They would never get away with something like that here in the U.S., that's for sure.
6651642	6653082	It's not the government's responsibility.
6653423	6654603	It's the parents' responsibility.
6654643	6656424	If they're not doing their job, then it's...
6657964	6658424	I agree.
6658624	6659325	Nope, I agree 100%.
6659365	6662967	It's not the government's responsibility, but whatever.
6663487	6664928	All right, moving on.
6665808	6668029	DarkTetsuya on Twitter wants to remind us of this.
6668089	6670211	And yes, this is something I definitely need to plug.
6670591	6674513	And we'll probably be plugging a little more as we hit the deadline here.
6674913	6702441	but the USL OLR Madness this used to be called March Madness but I guess they moved it for March 2011 is now open for nominations this is something a little more that our buddies at Under Station Live do and they really involve themselves with but we like to support it here at OLR and I know I have already submitted my list now if you don't know what this is it's basically a competition a la March Madness the NCAA competition to choose the greatest game ever
6703601	6703701	IDK
6726273	6736214	but you need to submit your top 25 list to uslmadness at gmail.com now the deadline is January 3rd 2011 so you have a little while but don't procrastinate
6737892	6738893	I agree with Jamie's thoughts on Cho and Ikki
6759395	6764278	I got the PS1 and to say that it's weird and or gay is an understatement.
6764638	6766179	It's like saying water is wet.
6766779	6770842	First it was a novelty for me, but once the novelty wore off, I forgot about it.
6771622	6774324	As long as you mean gay meaning happy, I'm okay with that.
6775649	6778970	Well, I mean, it's full of homoerotic imagery.
6779471	6782172	It is, it is, but I just, you know, whatever.
6783252	6785953	And you know me, I never use the word gay to mean anything bad.
6786333	6787214	I know, I know.
6788214	6789094	I mean, penis.
6791155	6796518	But anyway, there's a lot of games like that, though, where once the novelty wars off, it's kind of over.
6796939	6799680	There's sadly too many games like that out there, but whatever.
6800221	6802983	Anyhow, Tigerclaw sends us a variety of tweets.
6803083	6811888	I seem to remember there's a two-tweet limit, but I'm feeling generous, and I had beer before the show tonight, so I'm going to let him have all three tonight, because I'm kind and generous.
6812889	6817652	First off, the Toronto Police recover half a million dollars in stolen Sony goods.
6819332	6828702	they are on it up there in Canada a 39 year old man in Toronto was arrested for stealing half a million dollars we're assuming of course that's Canadian I don't know because they call it dollars too
6829584	6851480	PlayStation 3s, PSPs, and games apparently this was due to tractor trailers that were stolen on November 15th and 16th in Brampton these trailers had about half a million dollars in PS3s, PSPs, and video games that's where all the Sony stuff went in Canada well, the 39 year old was arrested and will be in court on January 10th of 2011
6854881	6856181	TigerClaw also sends us a link.
6856261	6860722	Standalone motion sensing game console believes honesty is the best policy.
6861123	6863123	This is linked to a story on Joystick.
6863863	6864863	What is this all about?
6864924	6867124	Apparently it's a knockoff of the Nintendo Wii.
6867984	6870285	There's a system now called the Wireless 60.
6871785	6874226	And there's a description on the back of the box.
6874626	6874766	Ha ha!
6875302	6875963	This is great.
6876284	6887204	The description on the back of the box says, If you are looking to purchase or own an Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Wii, or equivalent, this product does not compare or compete with these technologies.
6889773	6892094	Well, that's awfully upfront and endearing of you.
6892114	6892555	That's brutally honest.
6892575	6893135	Thank you.
6893395	6894456	Thank you for being honest.
6894816	6896917	But I love that it is in small print on the back.
6897297	6899298	If you're looking for a Nintendo Wii, but you know what?
6899318	6901099	This might not be what you wanted.
6901559	6902460	Just saying.
6903160	6909584	But if you want the golf kit and the ping pong kit, this is the system for you.
6910864	6911965	How much is one of these?
6912565	6913546	They're probably cheap.
6914821	6918305	I don't know, some of these games probably are much worse than a bunch of the crap on the Wii, honestly.
6918565	6921568	You might be selling yourself short a little bit there, Wireless60.
6924211	6925433	I love the name, too.
6926834	6929557	It's just shy of being Wii60.
6929797	6930318	Think about it.
6932443	6960605	and lastly from Tiger Claw in our last tweet tonight at twitter.com slash OLR people really did buy Donkey Kong with bananas do you remember that there was this whole promo with UK gamers and the UK could actually buy the game with bananas yes apparently there were some folks that actually braved the cold weather and 20 people walked away with the game having paid for them in bananas
6962492	6963313	How many bananas?
6964253	6965974	It just said a bunch of bananas.
6966535	6972079	So we don't know exactly how many, but it was the first 20 people in line to give a bunch of bananas.
6973399	6974360	Sounds like a fun promo.
6974900	6977682	And then all the staff's like, what the fuck are we going to do with these bananas?
6977802	6979043	It's basically a, eat them!
6981285	6982025	Dude, bananas are great.
6982045	6984527	It's basically a Black Friday-esque type of promotion.
6984547	6988009	I mean, Old Navy gave away Dance Central to the first few people in line, right?
6988069	6991712	So, I mean, you know, that's not completely unheard of.
6992301	6993762	Alright, that's going to do it for Twitter Topics Night.
6993782	6995423	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6995744	6997745	In the meantime, back to more gaming news.
6998006	6998326	Loki.
6999198	7000479	Yes.
7001559	7010325	So they had kind of an indie launch thing for the Xbox Marketplace.
7010785	7017649	Well, now there's kind of the Microsoft Game Studios promotion that they're doing for Xbox Marketplace.
7017689	7023173	And, of course, they have three games coming out for the Games for the Holidays presented by Microsoft Game Studios.
7023993	7033502	and, um, these three games would be including World of Keflings, uh, which does have Avatar support in it, Wrath of Skulls, and Ilo Milo.
7034203	7037086	Even though Ilo Milo you can get at, you know, now if you know how.
7038027	7038127	Um...
7039648	7047976	So, each, uh, looks like they're gonna be, um, you know, 800 Microsoft points each, uh, or $10.
7048937	7053521	And, um, Ilamilo, of course, is on Xbox Live right now.
7053621	7054522	There is a way to do that.
7054642	7057845	Or you can wait to the official release, which is January 5th.
7059127	7061449	Um, and then, of course... Now, why would I want to wait?
7062009	7063010	Exactly, who wants to wait?
7064212	7070037	World of Keflings, that is kind of a puzzle slash racer mashup game.
7070938	7075603	And that's going to be, I'm sorry, the puzzle racer is Rascals.
7076184	7078907	And that's going to be coming out on the 29th.
7079147	7081129	World of Keflings will be on the 22nd.
7081589	7082831	Like I said, those are each going to be...
7083591	7084731	800 Microsoft Points or $10.
7084892	7090453	And of course, if you buy more than one, there's some bonuses that you get with that.
7090493	7093794	Not necessarily money back, but some neat stuff anyways.
7093834	7097055	You get cross unlockables for each game.
7097355	7105038	For example, in Ilo Milo, you can get an unlockable Keflins or Rascal costume for Ilo or Milo.
7106018	7107238	by purchasing the other games.
7107358	7112980	Additionally, you can also unlock Elo and Doug as playable characters in Ratskulls.
7113880	7120701	And you can also unlock Ratskull characters within Elo Milo and World of Keflings by purchasing the full range of games as well.
7123202	7125142	Even crazier, it says you can get...
7128483	7131746	and Rascals Early by buying World of Keflings.
7132106	7137470	Rascals can be bought from within that game a week before it's released on the 29th.
7138330	7141512	Okay, I have to draw a map to follow all that, but fine.
7141913	7145135	So basically all these games are giving each other the reach around, essentially.
7145235	7145635	Pretty much.
7146176	7146996	Interesting promotion.
7147016	7147757	It's the three-way reach around.
7148017	7149418	I kind of like that idea.
7149458	7152780	I mean, even though none of these games are things I'm particularly excited about.
7152840	7153761	I guess you never know, though.
7153801	7156703	I mean, like, I didn't think I'd be excited about Super Meat Boy, and it's pretty awesome.
7157384	7157524	Yeah.
7159037	7165919	It's a neat promotion and very different from what the summer one where it's just like, buy X number of games, get points.
7166319	7166860	You know what I mean?
7167320	7169881	I kind of like the idea they've got going on here a little better.
7170461	7172041	So that's kind of cool.
7172301	7174302	I like the way the games are interacting with each other.
7174962	7176743	Do you have any interest in any of these games, Loki?
7177963	7179724	Rascals kind of sounds neat.
7180464	7182145	Ilo Milo looked kind of cool.
7183585	7185406	I never played Kingdom of Keflin, so...
7188243	7191016	I know I never played Kingdom of Keflings either, but apparently it's pretty popular.
7191237	7193186	But I thought it was only popular because of the Avatar thing.
7193959	7222850	but I don't know alright well moving on to a game I am really looking forward to and I was very disappointed it didn't make this Christmas but whatever it'll come out soon enough when it's ready LittleBigPlanet 2 is on its way pretty soon and there's a beta going on right now now there's an update that happened on the PlayStation blog where the marketing manager at Sony Computer Entertainment America talked through a tutorial how you can record voices in the game and assign them to characters
7223590	7224331	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7244565	7245326	Marissa needs to create Uta.
7265516	7266256	I love Marissa.
7266276	7267777	I wish I was able to see her when I was in LA.
7268037	7269318	But yeah, that's awesome.
7270098	7271259	I'm so looking forward to this game.
7271519	7272059	You know what though?
7272099	7274580	Creating levels in LittleBigPlanet 1 was hard enough.
7274680	7277281	I can't imagine how hard it's going to be in version 2.
7278202	7279362	But I'm very excited about this.
7279982	7280783	I hope you guys are too.
7281443	7284104	Loki, will you be doing some voice acting for a level in LittleBigPlanet?
7285045	7286025	I can, I guess.
7287706	7289647	AlphaCananagram says this is old news.
7289747	7290647	Whatever, it's new to me.
7290687	7291488	I'm not in the beta.
7291828	7294689	I haven't been following the news as closely as I should.
7295959	7298160	Yes, and Tigerclaw reminds us as well.
7298681	7300201	I thought this was on last week's show, but maybe not.
7300682	7303783	LittleBigPlanet 2 has no 3D support.
7304123	7306245	There will not be 3D in LittleBigPlanet 2.
7306765	7308726	And to that I say, thank you.
7309206	7310487	It is not necessary.
7312228	7312588	There you go.
7314639	7314939	DarkSakura?
7337748	7347135	Sega is, well, looking to expand back into the arcade market, but not in Japan, not in the US, but in China.
7348136	7363246	It, as being the second largest economy in the world, China seems like it's going to be a prime market for video games, especially arcade-based games, and so they are actually taking games like OutRun and Virtua Fighter and doing new versions of them in China.
7365008	7366349	It makes sense, but...
7368138	7369679	I'm really not sure.
7370400	7371020	What do you think Rob?
7373402	7373823	I don't know.
7373883	7380167	I mean I don't live in that country so it's hard for me to say what kind of culture it is but...
7383962	7389185	I hate that arcades are dying here, but at the same token, when was the last time I went to one?
7389325	7390186	It's been a long time.
7390606	7394189	But the reason why I don't go to them is that there's not a lot of serious arcades here anymore.
7394909	7403215	So I think if they're doing it more seriously in Japan and China, which makes sense because the internet cafe culture is much bigger there too than it is here.
7404036	7406398	There aren't really internet cafes here anymore.
7406499	7411365	I mean, there's one or two, especially in the Chinatowns and Koreatowns.
7411385	7413507	The biggest one I can think of is in Koreatown in LA.
7415743	7421187	But cyber cafes to us are like Starbucks where you bring your laptop and use the Wi-Fi.
7422148	7422968	Yeah, that's what I was like.
7423068	7425890	And there's so many neat cafes, especially in Japan.
7425910	7426951	I want to go to the cat cafes.
7427712	7436378	But I think it's to encourage a more social aspect yet still, you know, it offers a service with it.
7436818	7438639	Some of those social games were the best though.
7438679	7444922	And it is kind of a bummer that Xbox Live sort of took that and made it not needing to go to your arcade.
7445282	7455187	Like the best example I can think of is when Soul Calibur 2 was in the arcades and it had that mode where you had your own fighter and the arcade machine would start to kind of memorize how you play.
7455587	7459049	And then you could fight other people to take over the kingdom.
7459089	7460249	And remember that whole little mode?
7460269	7460690	That was awesome.
7460710	7461190	Conquest mode.
7461590	7462511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7480523	7508181	or um remember when I used Kilik something uh near and dear to our hearts remember when DDR Max 2 was in the arcades and had the community unlocks where the more you played the faster you'd be able to unlock stuff that was always kind of neat I think so and we would keep being and figuring out uh which one was next and how the pattern was working and how many points and I remember we would be there for some of the unlocks it was like oh my god we got an unlock we'd take pictures and stuff it's Santa Marita yeah
7510697	7512258	Max 300, what's this crap?
7513339	7513979	The hell is this?
7514660	7516101	So yeah, I think it's cool.
7516241	7524707	I hope maybe some of the ideas used in China and Japan, they can figure out how to make them work in the U.S., but I'm not going to hold my breath because I think the U.S.
7524767	7528490	is just a bunch of gambling for kids and these ticket-spinning machines.
7529470	7531652	Anyhow, Loki, do you have better news for us?
7532794	7535616	Ticket Spitting Machines The We Speak Microphone
7561363	7572147	Yeah, I came out with Animal Crossing, City Folk, and they're like, oh yeah, you can chat with other people, and hey, that's awesome technology to be able to chat with other players when you're playing games.
7572167	7577830	You know, something that's standard with, say, the Xbox and PlayStation 3, which is why we need to get rid of it.
7578990	7580331	That's sadly what's happening.
7580371	7584653	The Wii Speak peripheral is now limited at retail locations.
7585613	7592777	Additional shipments can be made if consumer demand increases, according to Nintendo.
7593037	7598619	Other than that, they are no longer producing those for retail.
7600100	7602081	Not to say that games won't still support it, but...
7603049	7603650	It's kind of sad.
7604290	7609516	Especially since they don't really have any sort of headset options or anything like that for the Wii.
7611799	7612079	I don't know.
7615091	7620012	Yeah, I mean, the Wii's kind of had to catch up in some ways, even though Reggie doesn't want you to think that.
7620072	7628134	I mean, in some ways, they had to really catch up to some of the technology at the 360 and the PS3 was doing, but it didn't work in this case.
7628174	7632895	And I think part of it was that they'll throw out these peripherals, and Nintendo's done this a few times.
7632916	7635876	They'll throw out these peripherals and then not really support them.
7636396	7639237	Like, there's one or two games that support it, and then that's it.
7639657	7642538	Like, the balance board, in some ways, is a bit of an anomaly.
7643078	7651421	If it didn't have this damn good A-plus game behind it, I think the balance board would be added to the list of stuff like Wii Speak.
7651801	7653182	But Wii Speak was for what?
7653282	7660505	A game on the Wii that honestly, and I hate to say this, wasn't very good because we'd seen it before.
7660845	7664706	If there hadn't been two other Animal Crossing games already, then the Wii version would have been awesome.
7665146	7666927	But that wasn't the case.
7668568	7670068	And then what else used Wii Speak?
7670248	7670548	Nothing.
7671349	7671649	Nothing.
7672709	7682238	So, and it's not like the Wii is known for its online gaming capabilities, where Wii Speak would come into play, so it was kind of useless.
7683899	7684360	Yeah.
7685822	7686502	It's unfortunate.
7688223	7690565	Some folks in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
7691966	7693607	I'm going to say this name again and butcher it.
7693627	7694007	I'm sorry.
7694907	7698369	Maginomicon says, yeah, that was a total waste of my money.
7698710	7702212	And to be fair, there wasn't a better offer on the PS2, a better showing.
7703192	7704253	I guess that's one way to look at it.
7705454	7709316	And then AlphaCanadagram in our chatroom says, seriously, why isn't the WeSpeak hacked already for the PC?
7711084	7711824	That's a good question.
7712164	7712784	Maybe nobody cared.
7713964	7716565	Because you could just plug a microphone into the PC and there you go.
7718625	7719125	Oh, yeah.
7719625	7724926	And Maginomicon also says, what about the broadband adapter for the GameCube?
7725006	7725686	Oh, my God.
7725766	7728787	Talk about a peripheral that really went wrong.
7729167	7731227	That could have been an awesome must-have peripheral.
7731267	7733648	And the Phantasy Star game on GameCube was actually really awesome, too.
7733668	7734068	Yes, it was.
7734148	7735488	It was Phantasy Star Online.
7735908	7740469	And it's a bummer that Sega made it because Nintendo just didn't care.
7741539	7741839	Yeah.
7744401	7745742	Nintendo hates Sega, confirmed.
7746482	7746803	All right.
7748163	7753147	One other story I have for you guys before we get to the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
7753187	7755909	Hey, Majinamacon says I pronounced his name right.
7756049	7759851	Woohoo!
7759871	7761012	Woohoo!
7761052	7762893	I know, I feel like I should play the level up music.
7763353	7763714	All right.
7763734	7764955	You all right over there?
7769156	7771017	I was singing a little music for you.
7790509	7799531	Apple made an update to the Terms of Service on Game Center this week saying that they will now use your real name when you send a friend request or reply.
7799951	7803692	So if you're going to add someone on Game Center, you better be prepared for them to see your real name.
7804172	7810514	Now, the rest of Game Center will not show the name, and if you already have people friended on Game Center, they're not going to be able to see your name.
7810854	7813955	They will see your user handle, and that's it.
7815135	7820938	And by the way, the Terms of Service also say that users must not pretend to be anyone or any entity they are not.
7822299	7826481	But this is not hitting that same kind of pushback that Real ID did.
7826901	7835085	Here's the thing, though, and I think a point that the game blogs are missing is that there were two big problems with Real ID that I don't see as a problem in Game Center.
7835425	7840468	Number one, Blizzard was threatening to put real names on their forums.
7841108	7867231	and fine don't post in the forums except for the fact that Blizzard will direct you to their forums to report bugs and things so it was a little bit of a catch-22 whereas we want you to use our forums but we're going to out your real name as a part of that and not to get into the rant I got into several weeks ago on this show when that was the news but let's just put this quickly if you think it's not a big deal to have your first and last name out there fine but keep in mind
7867731	7868211	and DarkSakura.com.
7891861	7892962	I don't like it being out there.
7916825	7931679	I sort of think I know what they were trying to do with that, but as somebody, again, who has stalked before because somebody used a friend of mine to get to me, I can see where this is a potential for problem, and it made me very mad about Real ID.
7932179	7938665	Now Blizzard got rid of it, they finally pulled their head out of their butt and they decided not to do this on the forum and they turned off the friend of friend.
7939045	7949554	They still have the real names in the game and if you add somebody to your friends list they see your real name and so forth but at this point I'm kind of like okay well I don't add people to my friends list I don't really know so it's really not a big deal.
7950675	7977047	um and that's kind of where Game Center's at and so I don't think it's the same thing that Blizzard's doing because now Game Center is doing what Real ID is now and nothing more and I think a big part of the reason why they're doing it is that there were the spammers out there people were posting on their Twitter you know add me on Game Center friends and then they got all these spammers I don't really know how you spam people on Game Center but whatever it was out there it was a problem so I think this is how Apple's trying to fix the problem
7978027	7986395	Something else to throw out there is that when I used Ping, wow to that tank, but I was on Ping for like a day.
7986755	7989398	When I signed up for Ping, I was able to use an alias.
7990298	7993341	If you search for Rob Roberts on Ping, you'll find me, my radio name.
7994202	7999347	So if that's the name that's being used on Game Center, then I really don't have a problem with it.
7999367	7999867	That's fine.
8000868	8014984	but I don't know like I'm too I don't really know anybody else to send a friend request to because at the end of the day Game Center there is zero point to it what does Game Center bring to the iPhone gaming experience not a damn thing achievements and scoreboards
8015825	8032297	whoopty shit especially for a lot of games that you could write off very easily these are not serious games whereas World of Warcraft that's a huge time thing for a lot of people and a very passionate experience whereas I don't think people get that connected to their iPhone games
8033238	8035159	You know, it's like LOL, Pocket Frogs.
8035419	8037100	I love my Peggle, you hush!
8037880	8040061	Honestly, I don't really play a lot of Game Center games.
8040602	8045204	Mainly, it's just Open Feint stuff, because there's a lot more games that I play that have Open Feint in them.
8045784	8048646	More of them are getting Game Center, but I don't really care.
8048946	8052387	Yeah, I have one game on Game Center, and all the rest of mine are Open Feint.
8053608	8053748	Hmm.
8056604	8062046	Game Center is... I don't think it's the same thing as Real ID.
8062466	8067368	Because at the end of the day, WoW has a lot of passion behind it.
8067828	8070369	Game Center has a lot of... I don't care.
8070809	8072290	No one care behind it.
8074255	8093457	if I had to delete Game Center at the end of the day I wouldn't cry but if I had to delete World of Warcraft I'd be very upset that Blizzard made such a dumb decision because you know I am you know call me an addict or whatever you want I am very invested in that game because it is a way for me to kind of play games online with my friends so there you go
8094659	8095519	Let's go to the mailbag.
8095619	8101541	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Every week you guys send us emails and we read them.
8102561	8107722	Now, the mailbag's been kind of light the last few weeks, but as I understand, the listeners have really pulled through this week, haven't they?
8107742	8109763	They did, and I've actually cut out the really long ones.
8110903	8111003	Aww.
8111023	8112343	Are you going to post them online or anything?
8112643	8113884	I might post them on the forum.
8114164	8115644	I said there's one I would post on the forum.
8115864	8116104	Okay.
8116944	8119125	But I have to do that when I remember to.
8119665	8121186	Um, so, first email.
8121786	8123607	Um, by the lady that sent us boobs.
8124287	8124747	Gamer girl.
8124847	8125368	Wait, what, what?
8125568	8125828	Boobs?
8126068	8126228	What?
8126408	8126508	Boobs?
8126528	8129889	She sent a picture of her chest and she's wearing an Eggo t-shirt and quite lovely.
8130290	8131190	Lego my Eggo.
8132511	8136532	Says, I just wanted to write the show and say you guys do an awesome job.
8137053	8139714	If you keep me, no, you keep me laughing and I love it.
8140214	8144216	I wanted to know if anyone is excited about the new Cataclysm experience.
8145136	8146397	Or do you think it's just hype?
8146457	8147137	Hey, hey.
8149252	8150373	I missed part of that, what was that?
8152155	8168230	Don't get me wrong, I've been a fan of World of Warcraft Warcraft is a hole for a good while now After all, it's my crack, aka way out of the real world for a while Anyway, just wanted to say, again, good job with the show, Sincerely, Gamer Girl
8169184	8169785	Thank you for watching!
8187447	8189809	It was now five years, six years old.
8190189	8192631	That's as long as a lot of game consoles last.
8192671	8196394	I mean, I realize now in this generation we're in, it's a little bit different.
8196454	8197815	But even now, we're what?
8197975	8199897	Five years since the Xbox 360 launched?
8200477	8204080	Honestly, we could use a cataclysm in Final Fantasy XI.
8204140	8209844	I mean, granted, they had Dynamis, the uber elite, hard...
8210945	8211485	Cataclysm.
8211565	8216607	But here's the point I'm really trying to make, is that the Xbox 360 has been out for, what, five, six years now?
8217047	8217948	And what are they doing now?
8217988	8221049	They didn't release a new console because of economy and so forth, but what are they doing?
8221069	8221849	They're releasing Kinect.
8222089	8223810	They're trying to reinvent the old experience.
8224150	8228352	Are you suggesting that the Red Rings of Death were the cataclysm of the Xbox?
8229312	8229492	Sure.
8230072	8237676	So now you have the Cataclysm coming to World of Warcraft as a way to kind of reinvent the game and make old stuff new again.
8237956	8240497	And so for that reason, yeah, I think it is kind of a big deal.
8240517	8244498	And I think if you are passionate... I mean, you already know right now if you're buying Cataclysm or not.
8244518	8246199	And the Goblin Rockets are pretty awesome.
8246319	8246559	They are.
8247960	8248540	But let's see.
8249060	8251561	I'm trying to make a long story short, and it's not really working very well.
8251621	8252542	But I will say this.
8253402	8268151	Cataclysm World of Warcraft was a great way for them to get World of Warcraft 2 without making it a whole new game and splitting the player base like what happened with EverQuest and Final Fantasy in some regards World of Warcraft Cataclysm is WoW 2
8269545	8286069	it might not be as jarring of a change but they went back and redid a lot of old shit and made it prettier and just short of the character models which I'm sure will be in the next expansion it's neat that Blizzard does innovate a little bit with each expansion it's pretty cool so I think it's a big deal
8287116	8290100	Okay, I'm done.
8290260	8293124	Did you hear that EverQuest 2 may be doing the same thing?
8293905	8294806	What do you mean the same thing?
8294906	8297069	Like a cataclysm type thing?
8298631	8299833	What's the point behind it?
8299873	8301896	Just trying to get people to play.
8302816	8304658	Hi, this is Rap's butt, and he's talking about games!
8328394	8332182	Anyway, my point is, they made a mistake splitting the player base.
8332543	8333866	But everybody got to learn from that.
8335570	8336171	Next email.
8336893	8338336	Aw, this makes my heart feel warm.
8340444	8341645	Rob, Jamie, and Loki.
8342346	8343827	I just wanted to say thank you.
8344408	8350774	Having a couple of back episodes to listen to at work helped me get through what has been the worst week I've had.
8351235	8358922	Listening to friends I've never met talk about and have fun doing something that they and I enjoy was a much needed bright spot and distraction from everything.
8359303	8360644	Thank you for all that you guys do.
8360924	8361225	Brad.
8361705	8363327	That's our Brad from PodCulture.
8363767	8364968	Thank you very much, Brad.
8365008	8365728	I appreciate that.
8365768	8368630	We had a really nice message on our Facebook this week, too.
8368710	8370752	It's been a week of warm fuzzies.
8370892	8371552	Thank you so much.
8371832	8372473	Must be the holidays.
8374586	8375187	Next one.
8375547	8376828	Hey guys, it's MoltenBrown.
8376908	8378689	I just wanted to ask you for advice.
8379269	8383132	I already have a Nintendo DS and I've been debating whether or not to get a PSP for a long time.
8383552	8389276	Part of me wants it for the way the system looks as well as better graphics the system offers compared to the DS.
8389836	8394359	But I don't know if it's worth the price to pay if there aren't that many games that I will like on it.
8395260	8400243	I really like RPGs, fighting games, and games that offer a different visual or playing style than the norm, like Hotel Dusk.
8401364	8401524	Patapon?
8422964	8423825	Patapon's cute.
8423885	8424505	LocoRoco?
8425026	8426227	Yeah, those are all cute games.
8426287	8430991	If you like RPGs and fighting games, you need that Square Enix game.
8431231	8433353	The fighting one that's Final Fantasy.
8433373	8434013	Yes, Dissida.
8434133	8435454	That should be number one on your list.
8435935	8439798	But if you like a standard fighting game, the Tekken games on PSP are pretty nice.
8441099	8443421	There's a Soul Calibur game out there, I believe, too.
8443922	8447184	There's also, as far as RPGs, Puppet Lacrosse was cool.
8447645	8448105	I loved it.
8448245	8448846	I played through it.
8450848	8455854	Final Fantasy Remakes Final Fantasy Remakes Final Fantasy Remakes Final Fantasy Remakes
8466275	8487641	but as for hand comfort given that I have hand problems after my surgery the PSP really is fairly comfortable just because of the curved ends on it but still reaching around for those buttons and I have these little short thumbs it's really about the same in my opinion don't you think Rob?
8488642	8489462	it's about the same feel?
8489878	8490578	I'm sorry, I missed.
8490939	8493260	Comfort of the console itself.
8494020	8497442	Do you think that the PSP or the DS is more comfortable?
8497922	8498742	Or are they about the same?
8500763	8506666	I like the feel of the PSP because it feels like I'm holding a controller that has a video on it.
8506766	8510608	And so, you know, I have kind of, you know, I'm six foot two, so I have kind of big hands.
8511028	8511709	So, I don't know.
8512049	8513450	The PSP is not really a problem for me.
8513810	8519273	The DS, it doesn't feel the same to me because you're using one hand to kind of write.
8519613	8523636	I think I actually, to be honest, I like the way the PSP feels a little better, I think.
8524656	8527538	That's why I don't like DS games that overuse the stylus.
8527638	8528559	Once in a while is okay.
8529139	8534743	But if I'm playing a DS game that now is stylus-free and uses the controller, then it's cool.
8536564	8537084	I'm cool with it.
8538045	8540046	But the square feeling is a little weird.
8541187	8543572	I think I actually like the PSP better overall, I gotta admit.
8544354	8547059	Well, just a few more because we really did get a lot of email.
8547721	8548602	Hello, OLR.
8548843	8550606	Another word from Belgium here.
8551960	8554061	My girlfriend brought Kinect for my birthday last week.
8554141	8555743	What an amazing piece of technology.
8556163	8558745	For the first time ever in six years, my girlfriend enjoys gaming.
8559085	8563027	Yeah, she played other games, but found them too complicated because of all the buttons you need to use.
8563528	8565069	Now she even asks to game.
8565489	8566890	Truly, this must be heaven.
8566930	8569332	She tested Wii and Move 2, but was not very interested in it.
8569692	8573515	She thinks both are too limited to control different genres of game.
8574715	8577577	Hell, even my father played Bowling and Connect and he didn't suck at it.
8578538	8580379	Anyways, as I stated, Connect is amazing.
8580459	8582621	Everything Microsoft promised works perfectly.
8583241	8585463	The major drawback is the space it needs, though.
8585483	8590606	My room is too small to decently play Connect, so I have to move my 360 and connect to the living room.
8591026	8593108	But that's not my biggest problem.
8593628	8595409	What I was thinking of is this.
8595849	8600012	I fear Microsoft might reveal a Connect 2 or Connect HD next to E3.
8601033	8603054	It will not need as much space as Connect needs.
8604896	8606317	Microsoft will announce this early.
8606918	8609841	Do we need to shell out another 150 euros next Christmas?
8610282	8613785	Or will they do no such thing and hold on to the spacious Kinect?
8614186	8617549	I don't think the space needed can be fixed with a firmware update.
8617930	8619191	I would like to thank you for OLR.
8619231	8620312	You guys really make my day.
8620432	8621614	Yours truly, Fabrice.
8622071	8625854	Honestly, you know, I think the third party company is going to come out with a solution to this.
8626174	8628916	And I think it's actually a lot simpler than it sounds.
8630157	8636041	But literally snapping on a lens to the front of that would probably fix that right there.
8636381	8636601	Yeah.
8636721	8639964	And I your other question about will they announce something new at E3?
8640384	8641064	No, no way.
8641204	8641765	Not this soon.
8642045	8642866	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8664344	8668067	I don't see them at all doing a Kinect 2.0.
8694287	8717698	if Kinect proves popular which so far it is I would expect that when we get to the Xbox 720 or whatever we call it Kinect will be built in to whatever it is they have planned next but that whole whatever's next is still a good two years out at least at least it might come a little it's going to come a lot sooner from Nintendo than it is the other two
8719862	8723864	Sony has said time and time again, 10-year cycle, 10-year cycle, 10-year cycle.
8723884	8726004	The only one that needs to catch up right now is Nintendo.
8726705	8732447	And in some ways, they don't because they're still selling like crazy because they're kind of the budget system at this point.
8732807	8737309	But I see them going more of the route like they do with the DS and the Game Boys and all that stuff where it's...
8738209	8741750	It's something that it's an upgrade but it still plays all the old stuff.
8741970	8748412	I absolutely 100% think whatever we see next from Nintendo is going to be Wii Evolved.
8748792	8751353	Not throwing out the whole Wii concept altogether.
8751373	8752293	The Wii's been a huge seller.
8752554	8753334	It's going to be Wii HD.
8753374	8754514	It'll be Weevolved.
8755094	8755675	Weevolved.
8756855	8758275	Actually, that'll be the name of the console right there.
8758295	8766378	Trademark Dark Sakura Origins Radio 2010 blah blah blah restricted.com boobs
8767919	8773004	So, uh, next, uh, and I'm only gonna do two more, we really did get a lot.
8773584	8774785	Um, greetings, Orange Knowledge Radio.
8774825	8779670	The first thing, I believe you're all mega excited to see Tron Legacy in about two weeks.
8780191	8784775	Well, I've been seeing this ad on Facebook, and well, let me pull up the ad, uh,
8790441	8792402	It's a big Flash U-Tron legacy thing.
8792482	8795064	Dude, that looks like it's going to load the old arcade game or something.
8795084	8795304	Flash.
8796104	8796925	I'm trying to see.
8797665	8799146	Light Cycles!
8799666	8803088	I bet that's like a Light Cycle arcade game on Facebook or something, huh?
8803188	8804129	Upload your face.
8804309	8805049	Get on the grid.
8805149	8808111	Oh, so you can take a picture of your face and put it in this trailer.
8809112	8809732	Oh, that's cute.
8810872	8815215	That's like those dancing elves that I see around work every year.
8816147	8817348	I hate the freaking dancing elves.
8817368	8818810	The jib jab, that's what it's called.
8819410	8821372	I'm going to post this in the chat room.
8822633	8825836	It's basically a face mapping app.
8826297	8828659	If you click on it, you may have to take a picture of your face.
8828959	8831542	Note I said face because it didn't recognize anything else.
8832423	8834364	And know that it didn't mean I took a picture of my balls.
8835425	8838648	What if you draw a smiley face on your penis?
8838689	8839069	Would that...
8841506	8843768	I used my Mabinogi screenshot of my character.
8844148	8846330	And you get to watch yourself get killed by Jeff Bridges.
8846650	8847791	Just thought you'd think it was cool.
8848672	8855798	Okay, second, if I were to start World of Warcraft on the original expansion, would I just be locked out of the places or should I get Cataclysm and start there?
8857488	8857888	Here's the thing.
8857928	8859889	Cataclysm won't work without the regular game.
8859929	8861210	I'm getting a lot of WoW questions.
8861610	8863791	HordeHousePodcast at gmail.com.
8863831	8864211	Just saying.
8865111	8866592	Don't you have to have all the other expansions?
8866632	8867032	You do.
8867152	8867412	You do.
8867452	8869193	But here's the thing, and a lot of people are missing this.
8869613	8876616	When they released the Cataclysm, when they released the Kraken, or Deathwing in this case, they evolved Old World permanently.
8877196	8883378	So if you have World of Warcraft and nothing but, if you have vanilla WoW, you will still get the new WoW experience.
8883538	8885699	The Old World is gone permanently.
8886525	8888806	So it makes it a really good experience.
8889767	8893429	There are other enhancements that make the Cataclysm worth purchasing.
8893469	8894589	But is Mr. T still there?
8895470	8896130	I believe he is.
8897311	8899252	He's not outside the cities anymore, but he'll come back.
8899632	8909918	Such as, and just a short list, the ability to level to 85, new dungeons and raids that come with that, the fact that you can roll a worgen or a goblin, and worgen is going to be a huge race.
8910018	8911919	I mean, there's tons of furries that want to play worgens.
8916606	8922288	I'm half tempted if somebody gets me the game to put Star Trek Online aside to give it a try.
8922408	8934572	Well, there's one other thing I want to throw out there, and that is now is an excellent time to suck yourself back into the world of Warcraft because Blizzard's been having this huge sale, and I don't know if it's over yet or not, but Vanilla WoW, five bucks.
8934953	8936753	Burning Crusade, five bucks.
8937193	8938454	Wrath, ten bucks.
8939214	8940576	20 bucks, get you caught up to current.
8940596	8941477	They even had one.
8941497	8943619	I already had the other two, the first two.
8943659	8945762	I'm not sure if it was going on during the sale though or whatever.
8946262	8950127	It was, you buy it at GameStop for $15, you get a $15 gift card.
8950347	8951788	You get it for free basically.
8951869	8952089	Nice.
8953530	8955252	Let me see if that sale is still going on.
8955312	8960338	DarkSakura, if that sale is still going on, I will buy you Wrath of the Lich King as a Hanukkah present.
8961843	8962123	Okay.
8963786	8964948	I'll give it a try again.
8964988	8965629	I mean, shit.
8966830	8969935	As much as I love Star Trek Online, I can alternate months.
8970836	8971317	Excellent.
8973015	8975937	I would, except I don't want to have to go out and buy Cataclysm.
8976337	8979259	I, on the other hand, will not be joining the World of Warcraft.
8979600	8983763	If you don't have an interest, I'm not even going to try with you, you have a baby anyway.
8984563	8988426	I don't join even the actual world right now, so.
8989126	8994190	I was just going to say, as long as you don't want to roll a Worgen or a Goblin, there's not a lot for you until you get up to level 80.
8995251	8998493	All I hear is blah, blah, wow, blah, blah, vanilla, blah, blah, blah.
9013379	9015740	Puppies, rainbows, kittens, unicorns.
9015940	9016920	Do I have your attention now?
9017180	9017781	Naked men.
9019321	9020122	Choaniki.
9020282	9021262	Choaniki.
9022722	9024443	No, I'm going to go finish.
9024983	9027464	MajinamiCon and other big words I can think of.
9029185	9029405	All right.
9029505	9033907	Okay, third, can you patch a UMD or download PSP import games to English?
9034327	9037348	Because I know that you can do that for the DS, so I was wondering.
9038108	9040029	I'm sure with an emulator.
9040149	9042790	I don't know if there's people that do that, but maybe.
9043050	9044632	It wouldn't be on UMD anymore.
9045012	9048436	You would have to have this whole ROM thing and then you're getting into shady hacks.
9048957	9050578	So I'm sure it's possible.
9050899	9054122	Don't ever doubt what the hacker community can do.
9054903	9058267	But you'd have to go to the darker parts of the internet to find it.
9059736	9060857	Okay, one last thing.
9060937	9064559	DarkSakura, in Comic Insanity, do you guys talk about anime as well?
9064979	9068221	Typically not unless they have a comic attached to them, and not necessarily manga.
9068261	9076465	We really focus on Marvel, DC, IDW, Udon, basically US-based companies.
9077866	9080387	Although we've gone into a little bit of the manga before.
9080727	9082008	I think it's one of those inevitables.
9082248	9087451	You know food is going to come up on OLR, and you know that manga's got to come up on Comic Insanity once in a while.
9088030	9090793	and He Who Shall Not Be Named on Comic Insanity.
9091034	9094377	And just like, and extroverts masturbation habits will come up on Horde House.
9094898	9095298	Just saying.
9095859	9098802	It says, thank you, and DarkSakura, your grammar coaching is appreciated.
9098842	9100964	Well, if you really appreciate it, you would have spelled grammar right.
9102708	9102948	Nice.
9103329	9104389	Let me get some comments from chat.
9104429	9106371	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com I love this comment.
9106711	9112976	SSJ100Matt says, So Jamie went from World of War crap to I might consider playing it over the course of an episode.
9113616	9116498	I might consider playing it if someone else buys it for me.
9116678	9118760	This is the awesome thing about Orange Launch Radio.
9118780	9120741	Hey look, last week we went from
9121562	9123923	Guy tweeting us saying, isn't this game cool?
9124223	9126803	To having the creator on our show hours ago.
9127983	9128864	Every gamer has a voice.
9128904	9129504	I love this show.
9129564	9130024	It's amazing.
9130644	9135005	DDR Dollar Bill in the chat says, shit, I'm still jonesing for DC Universe to try it out.
9135485	9136245	It's awesome.
9137746	9139126	It needs work, but it's awesome.
9139506	9144207	Remember, this is, if someone buys it for me, I would play it.
9144267	9144647	Fair enough.
9145047	9147708	And that means I'd have to give up Star Trek Online for a month.
9149699	9151360	And I don't want to be kicked out of my fleet.
9151700	9152941	So I still have to think about it.
9153301	9158484	SalaciousPop in our chatroom says, A UMD rip, which I've used, is like 500 to 900 megabytes.
9158764	9160105	That's an awful lot to patch.
9160565	9165548	Also, most torrented PSP games are just disk images, hence UMD rip.
9165929	9168310	Text patches actually modify game files.
9168770	9168990	Hmm.
9169511	9169531	I...
9170271	9175315	I would have thought though, because you can do it so easily with, you know, like Super Nintendo ROMs and stuff.
9175355	9179458	But then again, what, the largest Super Nintendo images are what, 16, 32 megs?
9179918	9183240	So I can see where it's probably a much bigger pain in the ass.
9184081	9187944	But again, don't doubt the hacker community.
9187984	9189885	Where there's a will, there's a way, right?
9191246	9192187	Indeed.
9192787	9193968	Any more emails tonight?
9194148	9195289	Oh, they're still reading this email.
9195609	9196390	Oh, my bad.
9197629	9200314	and thanks for reading my email and if you didn't, what the fuck?
9200415	9201938	Also, DarkSakura, fuck my life.
9202879	9206947	And why would you let Rob lick Dan's balls just to mess with you?
9208740	9211161	Remember, Dan made balls last week.
9211281	9211881	We were eating them.
9211901	9213361	Did you forget about your husband's balls?
9214102	9215822	No, it's just now they're ground beef.
9216302	9216422	Oh.
9216742	9218803	Your loyal listener, Haseo Sumiragawa.
9219383	9219743	P.S.
9219843	9221944	Can I get a woot from the Minnesota listeners?
9221984	9223304	Because Garrett Hedlund, a.k.a.
9223384	9228986	Sam Flynn, was born in Rosso, Minnesota, about 100 miles from where I live, and pissing distance from Canada.
9229326	9230146	Canadia!
9230626	9232487	Tron Legacy officially made a win.
9232847	9235548	All right, let's get a woot from the Minnesota listeners.
9239476	9240496	I'm sure they're out there somewhere.
9241136	9242577	Well, we have one last email.
9242717	9242977	Alright.
9243517	9246798	And this one, you know, it's... Okay.
9247599	9251820	I'm just trying to keep away from the political in charge stuff, but this is a good email.
9251840	9258502	With all the homophobia, don't ask, don't tell, Prop 8, among others, why does it matter if anyone is gay or not?
9259163	9266025	The way people worry about being gay or being near someone gay, I can't help but make the comparison to the X-Men movie Fear People Had Towards Mutants.
9266505	9268646	That's where mutants came from, kind of.
9270106	9282590	All the arguments against gay marriage, gays in the military, gay teachers, to me, are unfounded and stupid, and the more they try to defend their position, by the way, there I spell T-H-E-I-R, not T-H-E-R-E, position, the more stupid and ignorant they get.
9282890	9283190	Agreed.
9283670	9284370	Except for your spelling.
9285351	9290272	I hope one day it just won't matter, there's an apostrophe in won't, and everyone is treated the same.
9292633	9296056	I wrote this email after talking this very subject with my wife several times.
9296657	9301782	I just can't figure out why it matters in everyday life if one is gay or not.
9302223	9310812	What people do in the privacy of their own homes is their own business and why should it dictate if you can do a job to defend our country or get married?
9311212	9314535	Sorry for the email, not game related, but I just wanted your opinion on this again.
9315336	9317018	And there's a game-related part, so I'll read that next.
9318098	9318859	I agree with everything.
9319059	9320901	You missed it earlier.
9320921	9323303	I had my FKHH shirt.
9325044	9338295	Yeah, I mean, what you're saying, I think, is the... I don't want to say the right viewpoint, but in a way, it's kind of like, in a perfect world, or hopefully in the world our children and our grandchildren live in, you're right.
9338556	9339717	It won't be a big deal.
9339937	9341058	It's just whatever.
9341558	9342199	No one care.
9343440	9348787	But I think right now, I think sometimes, because there's two extremes to this.
9349288	9359501	There isn't necessarily just the homophobic side, but then there is the side that likes to drag people out of the closet, so to speak, which I'm not necessarily sure I agree with either.
9359521	9359561	No.
9360021	9388731	because there's people that don't want it to be that big of a factor that would prefer not to say that they're quote in the closet but that they just don't make it they don't for whatever reason want to make it a huge part of their life I think that one's life shouldn't necessarily be dictated by their sexuality yeah absolutely it's an aspect of the life but it's not your entire life I don't go around thinking about oh I'm gonna fuck Dan every day sorry
9390632	9392272	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9420239	9421880	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
9445414	9447156	When did you choose to pee sitting down?
9447756	9449338	When did you choose to pee standing up?
9449658	9450859	When did you choose to be gay?
9450919	9452180	When did you choose to be straight?
9453501	9454042	It doesn't matter.
9454842	9456864	Hey, Matt, when did you choose to be straight?
9459586	9460026	Boobies.
9461788	9462248	I don't know.
9463469	9464270	When did I choose?
9464570	9464850	Yeah.
9465351	9466492	I don't think I did choose.
9467009	9467509	Exactly.
9467929	9468250	Point.
9468450	9471831	But Matt's also on the side of reasonableness.
9471931	9474572	Matt is where the rest of America needs to be.
9474953	9475533	You know what I mean?
9475893	9479254	And generally, our listenership, I think, is on that same page.
9479515	9481495	That is promising more than anything.
9481936	9484657	You know, obviously, it's no secret on this show, I'm gay.
9485097	9485417	No, Rob!
9485437	9487618	Like you couldn't tell.
9501966	9502887	Well, hold on, though.
9503107	9507209	Remember, for the longest time, we were doing a live show and then a separate podcast.
9507609	9513452	So there were a lot of people that were listening to the podcast that weren't listening to the live show where the other talk was happening.
9513792	9521176	Whereas on the podcast, until we combined the shows, then it finally came out probably a year and a half after we've been podcasting.
9521676	9524017	And I'd mentioned some guy I'd been dating or whatever.
9524057	9526859	And there was quite a few emails that came in that next week.
9527979	9528299	Okay.
9528720	9531241	And I don't remember getting anything bad.
9531261	9531341	Yeah.
9532978	9535482	I got one that was a little iffy.
9535602	9539387	It wasn't necessarily negative, but it was more of an I'll pray for you thing.
9539988	9544574	And it was kind of one of those, you know, thanks, but no need.
9544755	9546417	I know that if there's a higher power...
9547538	9560970	I try to live my life to the best of moral being that I can and what higher power that is nothing but love is going to send me straight to hell to burn for an eternity for trying to be the best person I can be.
9561191	9564434	That's a ridiculous and fear-mongering way of thinking.
9565134	9567617	You know, that's the whole way I look at it.
9567657	9567897	It's like,
9569654	9573196	You know, it's, I'm trying to think.
9574497	9580461	Lifestyle is like going out to the clubs and dying your hair blue.
9581382	9583003	Or, you know, if you want to be seen.
9583283	9588586	Or, you know, lifestyle is how you live your life.
9588967	9590327	What you've chosen to do with your life.
9591548	9593829	But that's not lifestyle.
9593909	9595890	That's just an aspect.
9595970	9600033	It may contribute to your lifestyle, but it's not something that you choose to do.
9600533	9601013	You know what I mean?
9602634	9603595	I'm trying to make sense of this.
9603935	9605035	I don't mean to laugh at you.
9605075	9610238	I'm laughing at chat because you know Alan said something funny, so I'll read it in a minute.
9610418	9614700	It really shouldn't have to do with anything.
9615821	9617522	It shouldn't be anybody else's freaking business.
9619748	9631115	Uh, let's see, Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, quote, I will inform Jesus ASAP of your wrongdoing so that he may send his healy vagina beams at you so that you can go to heaven because I'm concerned about you so much.
9631636	9633017	Look, and I don't mean to mock religion.
9633337	9638960	I think there's a lot of good stuff that can come out of religion, but unfortunately there's also a lot of bad stuff that can come out.
9640461	9641242	You know what I mean, though?
9641642	9642142	You know what I mean?
9642262	9646005	I never want to disrespect somebody's religion until that religion disrespects me.
9647179	9649241	Lord Save Us From Your Followers
9667582	9674025	The whole movie is basically him actually going out and striking up conversations with people to find out why they don't like Christians.
9674645	9676786	Why they have a problem with evangelicals.
9676926	9679687	Actually just going in and asking.
9680667	9685669	He went to San Francisco, to Castro to talk to people.
9687590	9689311	Quite a few fabulous drag queens on there too.
9691095	9699102	The whole point is that you need to stop being right and start respecting other people.
9700062	9704306	That closed-minded, oh, this is the only way it can be.
9704786	9707668	Maybe it's because the Bible said this, or maybe my pastor said this.
9708109	9710230	This is the only way it is, and all the rest of you are wrong.
9711031	9714874	That's going to automatically close the door on anything you have to say.
9716505	9717506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9738044	9765718	and the thing that gets me and just the idiot perspective and the people that have the biggest problem I think sometimes with homosexuality and even so much what they're saying the problem is with Don't Ask or why they need Don't Ask Don't Tell is that straight men or certain straight men are threatened because they don't want guys checking them out they don't want other guys checking them out and there's a part of me that goes A
9766758	9767819	Get over yourself.
9770240	9773342	There's probably a lot of people that don't care less.
9773462	9779725	Just because someone's gay, I don't find every guy in the world hot just because I happen to be gay.
9780245	9782386	In fact, there's quite a few ugly ones out there.
9782406	9783247	I hate to say it.
9784928	9793953	But when people kind of have that perspective of like, well, I hope he's not gay because he's going to try to put it in my butt.
9794918	9796079	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9813900	9814501	What's the word?
9814541	9816002	Are they so insecure?
9816622	9817583	Yeah, insecure.
9817743	9818644	That's the perfect word.
9829291	9831371	There can be a level of attraction.
9831551	9838753	You may not fully, I guess, swing that way to use the quote, but it has been proven, there's studies out there, that everyone carries a little bit.
9838773	9847734	I mean, if not for, and I've said, I don't know that I've made this completely, I've talked to you about it before, but I mean, if not for Dan, I could easily have had a girlfriend.
9847774	9851115	I've had flings, you know.
9851855	9856676	I have, I'm completely attracted to everybody, I guess, you know.
9858196	9858436	But,
9860177	9863579	It's not like I'm going to go up to someone and go, boobies!
9864319	9864599	Really?
9864619	9866200	Because I think you did that once when you were drunk.
9866800	9867461	Did I?
9868021	9868781	I'm just kidding.
9868821	9869202	I'm kidding.
9869462	9874464	I will say one thing, and I've told you this off the air before, but it did kind of gross me out when I saw you kiss a girl.
9875625	9877726	Because I was like, that's so wrong!
9877746	9878907	Wrong!
9881868	9882429	You were drunk.
9882549	9883269	I have kissed women.
9883669	9883850	Yeah.
9884010	9884350	Big deal.
9886637	9888058	It was dumb fun.
9888178	9890340	It was stupid 12-year-old junior high stuff.
9890400	9891281	I'm not saying it grossed me out.
9891301	9892581	I'm just saying that's so weird.
9892722	9893282	I know, I know.
9894083	9895604	It was funny, but yeah, back to the point.
9896653	9900494	Yeah, it's interesting, but there was one other thing I wanted to say about this.
9900594	9901814	Oh, here's the thing.
9902055	9907836	If you're that guy that's really afraid of another guy hitting on you or whatever, here's a simple line to use.
9908336	9917959	If somebody ever reveals to you their secret man crush on you, brings you on the local talk show to out their crush or whatever on you, thanks, but no thanks.
9918679	9921940	I'll tell you what, straight people have been using that line for a long time.
9922400	9924060	Gay people use that line with each other too.
9924581	9925661	Thanks, but no thanks.
9927216	9927736	Thanks for watching!
9947385	9948826	I was like, well, thank you.
9948966	9949426	I'm taken.
9950786	9951666	It was that easy.
9951726	9953247	I mean, I wasn't expecting it.
9953407	9957728	But you came out of there and you were like, oh, hey, I'm looking hot today.
9958148	9958909	Well, you were there.
9959329	9960389	I was tickled all day.
9960609	9962130	I was like, she thought I was cute.
9962150	9963590	Isn't it nice to get a compliment?
9964630	9964971	I know.
9965111	9967491	I mean, I was like, that's so cool.
9967591	9972473	I mean, there wouldn't be a single person in this universe I would cheat on while I'm with Dan.
9973253	9973873	I would never.
9974533	9976074	What about Margaret Cho circa 10 years ago?
9979960	9983822	You know, I am completely and utterly dedicated to my husband.
9984222	9987143	You are completely and utterly dedicated to Alan.
9988624	9992246	And Matt here is completely and utterly dedicated to his phone right now.
9994887	9995587	That's correct.
9998409	10001370	You clearly love your wife very much.
10002571	10004252	Oh, I'm sorry.
10004292	10004552	Go ahead.
10005451	10010897	All of us in this room, we have found our person.
10011497	10013639	We are very happy people.
10015821	10022107	We have that level of security that even if we weren't with our significant others, that we'd just say, you know what, thanks, but no.
10022988	10023068	Hmm.
10024244	10025084	All right.
10025104	10026844	I want to say this in the chat because this is so good.
10027425	10030885	Brad from PodCulture Interim says, if someone is checking you out, be flattered.
10031185	10032685	Now, if they stalk you, different story.
10033166	10033866	Absolutely right.
10034026	10038506	And it doesn't matter what the genders are in that case too because stalking is when it crosses the line.
10038806	10047028	When thanks, no thanks doesn't get the message across like it should to most reasonable people, that's a whole nother problem.
10047068	10051629	And that is free of whatever sexuality happens to be the case.
10052029	10053469	Yeah, stalking is never cool.
10054677	10062204	So if someone tells you thanks but no thanks, try for a friendship or go fishing again.
10062404	10065947	And I've had times where the first time I've been like, no, I'm not really interested.
10065967	10067449	They came back a week later and said, you know what?
10068970	10070151	I still would really like to try.
10070171	10071092	Will you give me a chance?
10071812	10073074	I'm going to be okay.
10073134	10074054	All right, I'll give you a chance.
10074635	10076176	The third time, no, that's creepy.
10077257	10078157	Hey, you're cute!
10104548	10105409	I'll grow out of you.
10105910	10107551	I'll be here to pick you up when you're off work.
10107571	10116961	And I was like, I am... This is right when Dan and I were first, you know, considering each other.
10117342	10119143	But I was like, dude, I'm not interested.
10119364	10121566	I was like, thank you, but no, I'm not interested.
10121926	10122627	I'm gonna be here.
10123328	10126892	Well, I'll have you know that our security guard is an ex-Army Ranger.
10128314	10129915	and I'll be calling him to be here.
10130715	10131535	So the guy didn't show up.
10133536	10140719	But I'm saying, you know, you've got to be confident in yourself and take it as a compliment.
10141019	10143680	If someone is checking you out, go, yeah, huh?
10144781	10145221	In your head.
10145361	10147862	And, you know, if you're not sure, go, no, thank you.
10148162	10154705	If they're not loony and crazy and, you know, bizarre and shocking, then they'll go, well, okay.
10155045	10157326	Make sad face puppy eyes at you and then go pout.
10157881	10166145	But if, again, just to try and bring closure to this, if you're one of those guys or girls or whatever that's like, I want someone of the same gender checking me out, then you know what?
10166185	10169907	Your attitude is probably not attractive and no one is probably checking you out.
10170567	10171928	Just food for thought.
10172388	10173889	How about the game part of the email?
10174389	10175170	Game related stuff.
10175270	10178411	Earth Defense Force is one of my favorite games and can't wait for Earth Defense Force 2.
10178672	10180032	Hope it is online co-op.
10181033	10181393	Great ship.
10181696	10182696	It is online co-op.
10182736	10183257	Three player.
10184177	10184857	Great show.
10184897	10185798	Keep up the great work.
10185978	10189619	And honestly, and the honesty you have toward life and gaming.
10190079	10192060	Oh, that's a compliment.
10192300	10194681	The honesty we have towards life and gaming.
10194701	10199343	This has been a week of warm fuzzies for as far as compliments go and so forth.
10199383	10203285	And I realize it's not been a warm fuzzy week for everybody out there in the world.
10204085	10206586	What with just, God, the economy in general.
10206626	10209527	And it seems like we always have these stories about closures and other things.
10209728	10210628	It makes me feel tingly.
10211195	10213896	But it does feel nice to get paid a compliment.
10213956	10216338	We've been paid several this week and totally unsolicited.
10216938	10219659	I would like my next compliment in the form of money.
10219839	10220139	Stop.
10220580	10221320	No, I'm kidding.
10221360	10221740	I'm kidding.
10222060	10222480	Thank you.
10222520	10222801	Thank you.
10222841	10223161	Thank you.
10223361	10224321	Any other emails tonight?
10225422	10225902	Too many.
10226022	10227183	I'm done.
10227363	10228703	Well, sorry to those that didn't get through.
10228743	10230824	Unfortunately, you just picked the wrong week, I guess.
10231205	10232825	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
10233846	10234286	Try again.
10234566	10235887	We'll get to you at some point.
10236178	10238520	Alright, this is the part of the show where we do the FUs of the week.
10238560	10239260	I know, it sounds weird.
10239300	10242462	I just talked about, like, oh, what a warm, fuzzy week, and now I'm like, alright, time to rant.
10245564	10246064	But here we go.
10255911	10258192	Oops.
10259733	10260013	Oops.
10261074	10261674	You alright over there?
10261694	10262695	Yeah, I'm fine.
10262715	10264356	Um, FU to, uh...
10266724	10266904	Loki,
10292702	10297746	Uh, FU the stupid overclocked program because it only knows how to underclock and that's not what I want.
10297766	10304210	Uh, my FU of the week goes to traffic and people that don't know how to drive in the rain.
10304750	10307192	My god, some of you California people are so spoiled.
10307232	10310815	Like, the rain here is nothing and just, it rains and people don't know what they're doing.
10311355	10311455	Ah!
10312175	10312956	Uh, so FU to that.
10313276	10321342	And then, uh, FU to the fact that I just, I have a very, very busy week and weeks ahead and not that that's necessarily bad, but,
10322342	10322602	Yeah.
10324223	10326804	F you to the fact I can't just sit on my ass and be lazy all day.
10329064	10330345	Some days that's what I want to do.
10331265	10331565	All right.
10332185	10334806	Anyhow, let's move on to a couple more stories.
10334826	10336827	Then we're going to open up the Skype line.
10336847	10338007	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10338207	10338747	But not just yet.
10338767	10339308	Well, fuck this.
10341168	10342269	Don't say that to the chatters.
10342409	10343449	No, not the chatters.
10343809	10343989	No.
10344909	10349371	It's having to be the print preview at 8.45 in the morning, which I guess is better than 6 in the morning.
10350808	10351929	Oh, you have to get up early tomorrow?
10352509	10353870	Fucking A. Lame.
10354330	10354870	Lame!
10354890	10356451	Alright, how about some more stories?
10356471	10357331	But I'm looking forward to going.
10357511	10357831	Loki.
10359332	10359812	Alright.
10359832	10362354	So this is neat.
10366376	10366816	Actually...
10368956	10371517	The Michael Jackson game.
10371757	10374598	Now, I'm not necessarily one to get it on the DS.
10375278	10379340	Maybe the Wii, maybe the Kinect and stuff when that comes out because it's supposed to be just like Just Dance.
10379960	10387883	But for the DS, of course, they've done some very specific things if you try to, say, pirate the ROM.
10389003	10391304	This is kind of neat, and I know Jamie will get a kick out of this.
10391884	10399367	One of the things that they do, first off, is they have Vuvuzela playing on top of all the songs during the game.
10399527	10403349	And then, of course, they render the game's touchscreen non-functional.
10403429	10409472	So you don't get to play the game and you don't get to listen to the music untainted by the Vuvuzela.
10410972	10412013	I love it!
10412633	10414374	I want to do that just for the Vuvuzela.
10415067	10420292	I have to admit, as much as I hate it when she breaks it out on the show, I think that is a really funny anti-piracy measure.
10420372	10424635	And I think more companies, you know, if they want to fight piracy, they should be doing it this way.
10426196	10428478	Actually, I will have you know this.
10432737	10454797	I actually played a real Vuvuzela this week one of my friends was having a birthday party and one of the other friends that came to the party brought a Vuvuzela with her and so I played it and it took me a minute to figure out how to play it like the first couple times I was doing it it just kind of sounded like a really loud wet fart but once I was able to get it it was kind of fun
10456058	10456738	So, there you go.
10456818	10457959	What are you taking pictures of me for?
10458099	10458539	What's this for?
10458559	10459740	Are you going to take my soul?
10460520	10460840	Alright.
10461581	10462701	She's stealing your soul!
10465763	10466844	Your soul is hers.
10466904	10467344	Dead air.
10468765	10469465	I don't know what she's doing.
10469645	10472667	I downloaded an iPhone app that's like... Is this a fat booth program?
10473167	10474588	No, it isn't.
10474788	10476289	It does gal-style hair.
10476309	10478630	Oh, God!
10479331	10480511	What is wrong with you?
10480792	10482112	Are you going to put that on the website?
10482192	10482412	Yes.
10484741	10487347	I think then I should get to do the unicorn pic of you.
10487367	10489673	Okay.
10490335	10491959	I'll do the unicorn picture here in a minute.
10494747	10496268	TigerClaw in our chat says, I'm Rob.
10496288	10498050	That isn't one of Vuvuzela's sounds like a wet fart.
10498270	10499311	I know I was playing it wrong.
10499351	10499872	I told you.
10502434	10503495	I'll find a better hairstyle.
10503895	10505057	One more story for you guys.
10505517	10507118	And then I got to take the picture of the unicorn.
10507158	10508520	So Loki's going to have to take the calls tonight.
10508880	10509120	All right.
10509501	10512423	Anyhow, this is a game and I don't even know what to think of this.
10513544	10515186	It's a game called Cock Out.
10515947	10516247	And it's a...
10521158	10521438	DarkSakura.com
10551311	10552611	I'm surprised you're not still giggling.
10553192	10556193	And it's just basically all these guys that look like they're whacking it.
10556933	10559214	And I guess they're supposed to be playing this game.
10559554	10564976	Now the part that gets me is that, okay, I just reported on this and it's all over the game blogs and so forth.
10566116	10567476	What's the actual game?
10567716	10569837	Why are all these guys looking like they're jerking it?
10569957	10571318	Is that, that's it?
10572498	10577960	Is there any type of strategy or anything to it or any, why am I asking these questions?
10578020	10578560	Of course not.
10580666	10581967	Why am I even bothering, right?
10585090	10586431	Are you taking another picture of me?
10587191	10588212	Alright, hurry up.
10588512	10591014	Loki, can you give the phone information while she takes this damn picture?
10592455	10594417	So, to Skype us, 1-877-GAME-OLR
10598758	10601921	and do that via Skype or via the 1-800 number.
10602401	10604143	And then on Skype, what was it?
10604223	10605144	Orange Lounge Radio?
10605184	10607446	Orange Lounge Radio.
10607466	10609748	Or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10609988	10611890	Our Skype line is now open.
10611930	10612591	Give us a call.
10614432	10614933	There you go.
10615793	10620858	Maybe you need one of those pictures of Loki.
10621018	10622940	Do you have any last minute stories for us, Loki?
10624039	10624940	No, I'm not next.
10625901	10626502	I'm sorry.
10626522	10628884	You missed having a mistake with somebody else.
10629085	10629385	All right.
10629705	10631968	I'm going to get the DarkSakura's unicorn picture real quick here.
10632668	10635852	So in the meantime, do you have any last-minute stories while we wait for some calls?
10636343	10641926	Well, I was just going to mention how awesome Swords & Poker 2 is on the iOS platform.
10641946	10643027	Definitely need to check that out.
10643387	10646389	If you haven't already, it's a pretty awesome role-playing game.
10646769	10651272	And I'm not getting paid by them, which is disappointing because I can really use extra money.
10651512	10653393	I mean, who can't use extra money?
10654093	10658496	And hopefully that's bought me enough time to get into the forum to where the extra stories are.
10658956	10660597	Because I have not been looking for extra stories.
10660637	10661898	I have been playing with my phone.
10662698	10663739	And, of course...
10667788	10668328	Awesome.
10668668	10669709	What the hell is this?
10671049	10676130	Apparently there is a NASCAR Superstar driving game that will let you race dumpsters.
10676730	10677691	That's pretty funny.
10679971	10689534	Yeah, Jimmy Johnson's Anything with an Engine is a brand new game and apparently lives up to its name and you can race a dumpster with a rocket apparently on it.
10690034	10691094	That is pretty awesome.
10693666	10695327	Also, I'm not sure if anyone saw this this week.
10695567	10697188	I'm sure a lot of people have.
10697648	10703352	The custom Tron bikes that they had out there, the light cycles, pretty awesome, except for the fact that they don't glow.
10703572	10704633	They're completely unrideable.
10705534	10706554	They're not unrideable.
10706614	10708015	They look way uncomfortable.
10709076	10712939	And then you have to push them to get them going and you don't fall over.
10713879	10718142	How they have that four-wheel vehicle that they have now, they should have made that instead.
10719183	10721785	How the crap do you change the tire?
10722839	10726293	you can't, it's a custom tire see?
10726855	10727518	waste of money
10729561	10731522	I was going to mention DJ Hero 2.
10731823	10735164	They've got some new download content coming out for that, which is pretty exciting.
10736085	10737926	Especially since it's got more Prodigy in it.
10738546	10744550	And one of the songs I was hoping to make it into the game to begin with that didn't, but now it has.
10745170	10749172	Invaders Must Die mixed with Debaser from the Pixies.
10749753	10750593	That's kind of cool.
10750713	10754775	Beastie Boys Body Movin' mixed with Lenny Kravitz, Rock and Roll is Dead.
10754795	10756276	Of course, this stuff is already out.
10756316	10757197	It came out this week.
10758197	10760939	Next week, actually two weeks from now, the old school pack.
10760959	10764861	They're going to have Fat Boys with Human Beatbox mixed with Mantronics.
10766061	10766862	Mantronics.
10767062	10768002	King of Beats.
10768083	10771264	Dude, Kurt Mantronics is fucking awesome.
10771344	10772965	Tag Team, whoomp, there it is.
10773225	10774226	Once again in another game.
10775026	10778788	Mixed with 45 King, the 900 number.
10779308	10783871	And then Beastie Boys, Triple Trouble mixed with Tone Lock, Funky Cold Medina.
10785512	10791777	and then December 21st, Linkin Park Mix Pack with the Catalyst Does It Offend You?
10792117	10798623	Yeah, remix and then When They Come For Me remix and Points of Authority remix.
10798663	10799984	The Points of Authority is going to be awesome.
10800464	10802005	Okay, I have a call sitting on hold, sorry.
10802585	10803345	Caller, you're on the air.
10803405	10804246	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
10804266	10804586	Who's this?
10805346	10808687	It's Ranma, and this time I wasn't even trying to get on before everybody else.
10808767	10816290	I know, you know, I was so distracted because I was taking the picture of Jamie and making a unicorn out of her because I'm looking at these, what the hell are these pictures on the website?
10816330	10817431	You have problems.
10818491	10819091	You know you love them.
10819111	10820832	I look like a Parapara girl in these pictures.
10820852	10821912	That's exactly it.
10821952	10823493	I'm going to make this my Facebook picture.
10826641	10827121	I love that.
10827181	10828242	You should totally do it, Ranma.
10828282	10828522	I will.
10829142	10829782	Sorry, Ranma.
10829902	10837965	So anyway, check OrangeLaunchRadio.com in just a few seconds because I should have Jamie's unicorn picture up there in a minute where it looks like the cat is jerking off her horn.
10838105	10838525	It's amazing.
10838945	10839206	All right.
10839546	10840506	Hi, Ranma.
10840566	10841006	How are you?
10843967	10844588	Yeah.
10845508	10846068	Damn it, Scott.
10846088	10848489	You surely don't have a way of derailing, don't you?
10848877	10849997	Yeah, well, you know what?
10850037	10855079	Look, I just want to point out, I want to remind you, our guest tonight made a game called Techno Kitten Adventure.
10855820	10857000	Which I downloaded.
10857260	10857801	What'd you think?
10858861	10866664	I haven't played it yet because I found a Moe Japanese game on the live marketplace, downloaded that, and had my roommate playing it for the last 20 minutes.
10867164	10867464	Nice.
10868125	10868305	Yes.
10869045	10870906	Sorry, I'm looking at JB's picture.
10870946	10872086	Tonight's been a great night for pictures.
10872526	10876808	Anyway, excuse me, so what did you call in to talk about tonight?
10877591	10883355	I really want to talk about a couple of things, but it turns into a lot of things, but I'll make it short and sweet as possible.
10884175	10891900	Number one, this whole German AIDS thing, for obvious reasons, I'm kind of sort of offended by it, but I'll let that be.
10892141	10893621	Wait, why are you offended by this?
10894882	10895663	It's just whacking.
10895683	10898765	Let's just say I have people in my family who have died of said disease.
10900166	10900426	I see.
10900467	10902429	So you find this to be disrespectful.
10902949	10903250	Yeah.
10903570	10903891	Hmm.
10905212	10906093	Okay, interesting.
10906393	10916025	This is interesting because, well, is it just disrespectful because it seems to be so trashy and in your face type of thing?
10916746	10918628	That pretty much is the case.
10920242	10932129	What do you think about this whole, I've got to pick your brain on this, and I'm sorry because I know this is a sensitive issue to you, but I want to ask this question because this is something that's been on my mind this week, and it really has nothing to do with gaming, but whatever.
10932169	10933490	It's been an interesting Part B tonight.
10934410	10946978	Have you seen that whole campaign of the celebrities who have quit Twitter to try and raise a million dollars for AIDS awareness where they're all lying in the coffins dead and so forth?
10947258	10948579	What do you think of that whole thing?
10949907	10959501	I think it was quite ridiculous, and I don't know if you saw, but on my personal Facebook page, I made a statement about that, and a few people agreed with me about it.
10959681	10960462	No, I missed it.
10961764	10962886	I'll link it to you later.
10963346	10965890	I have made a personal statement about how I truly felt.
10966858	10973922	And can you summarize it or am I getting a little too... Long story short, I understand this epidemic.
10974562	10979604	But instead of dealing with the whole world event, let's take care of America first.
10979644	10985187	Let's take care of the AIDS issue and the US first before we go running around taking care of everybody else.
10985387	10992711	Why give all that money to those world charities when you can send that same amount of money to American charities for the same cause?
10993351	10997196	Well, I would hope that we can find a cure, and that'll be good for everybody.
10997576	10999058	That's my hope.
11000299	11000620	All right.
11000900	11005886	Well, I didn't mean to derail, but what else is on your mind tonight besides potentially offensive games?
11006707	11012513	The whole thing about people not being able to get over themselves because guys make these compliments and so forth.
11012714	11012894	Mm-hmm.
11014167	11015408	I thought it was amusing and so did they.
11015688	11016389	I had no problem with it.
11041846	11053636	Right, like I'm sure, you know, a lot of straight people have that friend of the opposite gender, like a guy, a straight guy has that girl that he flirts with, but it's nothing more than that, you know?
11054517	11062464	I'm sure there's, you probably have girl, not just gay guys, but girlfriends, not, I don't know, friend girls that you do that with too, you know?
11063410	11064350	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11084997	11086077	Wow, okay.
11086317	11087538	I'll give you that.
11088038	11089859	Anything else on your mind, Ranma, before I let you go and get more calls?
11090539	11093120	I played that ROM hack of Super Mario Bros.
11093140	11093120	3.
11093160	11096061	That thing is three levels below Asshole Mario.
11099382	11100882	Three levels below, huh?
11100942	11102683	That's a pretty precise rating.
11102883	11107425	Alright, Ranma, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for your insight tonight.
11107465	11108005	I appreciate it.
11108065	11108485	Take care, buddy.
11110461	11114184	You know, I was just telling the significant other, we really need to go to New York City.
11114204	11115785	And when we go, we're crashing with Ranma.
11116866	11118447	Or as Hextafer would say, Ranny.
11119107	11122190	So you better be careful because I really want to get back to New York City.
11122230	11123110	It's been a very long time.
11123311	11125132	And my one friend that lived there moved to Texas.
11125212	11128714	So I'm coming to the couches of OLR listeners.
11132772	11161037	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio all one word if you want to give us a call we probably got time for about one more call we are running a little long tonight so probably because of the interview earlier meanwhile while we wait for the phone to ring Loki do you have any other last minute stories I don't know if you spent them all or what I've only done one of them so no I haven't spent them all alright then what else let's see what else can we talk about here how about how about I just look up here
11162248	11163329	Why is this even open?
11163969	11166350	It's odd.
11168192	11170113	Hold on.
11170153	11174535	While I wait for your riveting last minute stories, let me go to at least one more call here.
11174915	11175996	Oh my god.
11176596	11176997	Hello?
11177777	11179178	Yes, it's Legend of Zaku here.
11179278	11181979	Hi, welcome to Orange Launch Radio, Legend of Zaku.
11182840	11184401	Oh my god, what's on your mind?
11185616	11189299	Nothing much, just trying to kill a Sunday night before heading to work tomorrow.
11189440	11196706	But yeah, a lot of games came out in the past couple weeks that I've been dying to talk about.
11197486	11202370	Obviously Gran Turismo 5, even though I don't have a PS3 yet, that's on my top list right now.
11203826	11210092	And so we're basically just trying to catch up on some other 360 games that I haven't been able to play.
11210352	11212414	Let's just say I managed to get a 360 again.
11213294	11213755	Well, talk to us.
11213775	11214536	What have you been playing?
11214676	11215997	Playing catch-up again.
11216337	11217138	What have you been playing?
11218839	11224001	Um, when I didn't have my 360, it was nothing but Left 4 Dead and Battlefield on my computer.
11224501	11231364	But now I'm just playing small stuff like Sonic 4, Ace Combat 6, Resident Evil 5.
11232044	11236966	Although hopefully my girlfriend will hook me up with more recent games for Christmas.
11237386	11239747	I've already gave her a wish list of what to get me.
11239987	11241068	Is that what you asked Santa for?
11242051	11246773	Well, yeah, Santa and the four of my girlfriends is willing to spend money on me just as I'm willing to spend money on her.
11247034	11247994	Okay, very cool.
11248314	11253857	Well, tell us about what's your favorite game been that you've discovered in the past couple weeks since you got your 360 back?
11254717	11255078	I don't know.
11255118	11257579	I mean, Sonic 4 has been really challenging so far.
11258019	11258239	Really?
11258279	11260380	There's been a lot of hate on Sonic 4.
11260881	11262301	There's been a lot, a lot of hate on Sonic 4.
11263062	11263822	Do you disagree?
11263842	11264682	You think the game's awesome?
11264702	11266683	No, it kind of feels like a classic Sonic game.
11266743	11271506	I know it still has elements from the recent ones, like the whole homing attack thing.
11272881	11286164	I mean, I could do without it, but it just, you're right, some may say it's not fluid enough because it doesn't, it's not, it's not like the old-fashioned Sonic where the screen would just like literally breeze by every time he just like, every time he literally moves.
11287144	11293486	So yeah, you're gonna have some hate from those classic fans, and I'm one of them because I grew up on that.
11295072	11295873	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11315968	11323154	I haven't played that game yet since I don't own a Wii or a DS, but from what I've seen, it's probably the same gameplay.
11323674	11326056	It's mostly platform now, from what I hear.
11326236	11327257	I mean, 2D platform.
11329381	11332063	Sonic Colors is where it's at right now in the Sonic universe.
11346416	11349579	I should have bought one when it was $100 a GameStop over Black Friday.
11349859	11351581	You never know when they might do the next price cut.
11352401	11354543	I don't know if they'll get that low, but then again, the PS2 didn't.
11354563	11356124	No, but I mean, it was for used systems.
11356865	11358026	Just like I picked up a used 360 for $100.
11361869	11364030	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Legend of Zaku?
11365271	11370853	DDRX2 is going to... Well, they're taking orders for it's supposed to ship out in two weeks.
11371913	11378435	So, every... It's just... So far, it's shaping up to be pretty solid at this point.
11379176	11386178	You know, fears about, like, drifting arrows and what the community was saying about, like, being off sync.
11386538	11387959	They're starting to get quelled every...
11389531	11402020	Let's just say that Konami has already taken folks from Bomani Style and already proven to them that the final build of the game will be rock solid and something that the hardcores will definitely start playing.
11402900	11408484	Assuming the arcades shell out $10,000 for a new machine, which is the only way you're going to get the new game.
11409125	11411146	Or unless you already have X and you get the upgrades.
11412159	11412359	Alright.
11412880	11418686	Well, uh, by the way, you need to check out Home, because they have DDR machines in Home, but you don't really get to play DDR on them.
11418906	11422109	But I giggled when I saw the X2 machines in the Konami Home space.
11422910	11430577	Yeah, and I'm hopefully, you know, assuming I get my Christmas bonus this year, I will definitely shell out money on a PS3.
11431358	11431678	Alright.
11431959	11434421	Alright, buddy, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call.
11434701	11435322	Alright, take care.
11435402	11435462	Bye!
11437489	11438909	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
11438949	11445051	I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but we kind of are running long a little bit tonight, and we still want to get to the afterbirth and all that good stuff.
11445091	11450993	So email us your thoughts, mailbag at orangelandradio.com, or send us tweets, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
11451554	11454374	Meanwhile, we've got to wrap it up, put the nail in the coffin of the show.
11454414	11455795	Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki?
11456215	11456836	Yeah, real quick.
11457396	11458237	This is kind of cool.
11458837	11469205	From the same guy that did the Left 4 Dead demake, kind of making the pseudo NES version of Left 4 Dead, but it's a PC game.
11470005	11472387	Pixel Force also did that too.
11472427	11473348	DJ Hero.
11473448	11476510	Now they have an 8-bit DJ Hero game you can check out.
11477591	11483736	It's got a bunch of cool chiptune mashups, including the... This is kind of cool.
11484176	11489419	The Ghostbusters theme and Huey Lewis and the news I Want a New Drug mixed together.
11490240	11490820	I can hear that.
11491601	11498405	Apparently they said that it got some of the background or whatever was sampled from the same song or something.
11499266	11502408	But lots of cool stuff and you can check it out for free.
11503608	11505570	And let's see where you can download that.
11505690	11507211	Oh, ericruthgames.com
11509164	11509904	XBOX Live Rewards Program
11524696	11530699	But you get some kickback Microsoft points for different things that you do.
11531340	11537483	For example, renewing a one-month gold membership will give you 10 Microsoft points back.
11538643	11539184	Three months, 30.
11540204	11540885	And 12 months, 200.
11542225	11545367	Purchase or renew an Xbox Live Gold Family Pack.
11545447	11546507	That gives you 400.
11548288	11552030	Purchase or renew the first Xbox Live Online Gold Membership, 100.
11553431	11555691	Make your first purchase on Xbox Live another 100.
11556792	11559072	Selected content is going to vary.
11560092	11562673	If you activate and use Netflix on Xbox Live, you get 100.
11563613	11566033	And they have surveys for 20 Microsoft points.
11567674	11568414	So, neat.
11568934	11570914	You can do surveys and get 20 Microsoft points?
11571154	11571334	Yes.
11572314	11572695	Interesting.
11573075	11574975	It'd take a lot of surveys before you can actually buy something.
11574995	11575415	That's true.
11575935	11578716	Well, you could get Techno Kitten Adventure for four surveys.
11579916	11580396	That is true.
11580416	11580596	Yeah.
11581178	11581438	All right.
11582979	11585561	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11585581	11586602	We're about on out of here.
