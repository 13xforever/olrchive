0	19960	Tonight, December 19th, 2010, Cataclysm sells Oodles Noodles, the crime victim calls for
19960	29960	the ban of Mafia 2, and Kinect's first sex game gets the smackdown from Microsoft.
29960	35440	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange
35440	44280	Lounge Radio, December 19th, 2010, episode 394. It's the show where every gamer has a
44280	50600	voice. Join us live in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com. My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be with you
50600	55040	over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
55040	56040	Yo.
56040	57040	How you doing?
57040	60680	I'm doing well and energized and electrified.
60680	65480	You're energized. Electrified, gosh, you sound, I don't know, like you've just been to Xanadu
65480	66480	or something, I don't know.
66480	68160	No, I saw Tron twice this week.
68160	69480	Oh, wasn't Tron amazing?
69480	70480	I know.
70480	74560	Okay, I'll get into that in a minute, though, but I have to introduce, of course, the one
74560	76160	and only tech master, Loki!
76160	77160	Hi.
77160	79160	How are you doing, Loki?
79160	80160	Fine.
80160	83720	You know, I remember a time when you really hated all things Apple, and now it's funny
83720	87120	because at the start of the show, I'm always having to tear you away from that new little
87120	90000	eye touch you have, or you've had for a couple months now.
90000	93680	No, you see, I hate all things Mac, not Apple.
93680	95080	Oh, my bad.
95080	98280	Apple 2 was a pretty awesome computer back in the day.
98280	100000	It's true, it's what we all played Oregon Trail.
100000	105760	But I'm sorry, all those Mac computers are way too damn overpriced.
105760	109500	Making friends, and we're not even five minutes into the show. It's just the three of us here
109500	113400	in studio tonight, sadly no guests joining us, but it is our last show of the year, if
113400	114400	you can believe it.
114400	118780	We're not going to be here because of the holiday next week, sadly, sorry, but some
118780	122000	of us are going out of town, so we're not going to be able to get everybody together
122000	123000	to do the show next week.
123000	126040	So it's our last show of 2010, ah!
126040	130240	So don't worry, guys, we'll be back, of course, in two weeks, and we have plenty of show to
130240	131760	go to tonight.
131760	135720	So we always like to start things off with how is your gaming week, but can I just say
135720	139640	OMG Tron, like, wasn't it great?
139640	141320	I know!
141320	144200	So you had to go see it, what, Tuesday? How'd you swing that?
144200	147560	Well, um, Jessica Harper had an extra ticket.
147560	149480	Yeah, and she was on the show a few weeks ago, right?
149480	152720	Yes, and, uh, she, uh, let me have it.
152720	153720	And so we all went.
153720	154720	Nice.
154720	155720	And what'd you think?
155720	156720	Ugh!
156720	157720	Oomph!
157720	161740	What was the best part, well, without spoiling, because keep in mind there's a lot of people
161740	165040	that are like, OMG, you don't want spoilers, so is there a way you can kind of say the
165040	170340	best part of the new Tron movie without ruining everything, anything?
170340	175680	Not really, because I like how everything flowed together, but I'd have to say I have
175680	180600	a favorite line, as we've discussed earlier, but I'll go ahead and repeat it.
180600	183000	The cycles haven't been good, have they?
183000	185440	You don't look that bad.
185440	186440	Very nice, very nice.
186440	187440	Yeah.
187440	188880	Loki, you got to see the Trons as well?
188880	189880	Yes, I did.
189880	190880	How was Tron for you?
190880	191880	It was awesome.
191880	192880	Yeah?
192880	197480	It was just everything I was hoping it would be, so I would definitely see it again.
197480	199280	And everybody here saw it in 3D, right?
199280	200280	Yeah.
200280	206320	Honestly, this is a movie that it is totally beneficial to see it in 3D, because, I'll
206320	208720	just say, Wizard of Oz treatment.
208720	213880	Yes, it's not all in 3D, but it's very interesting.
213880	218240	And yeah, I would just say my favorite part was how they upgraded some things from the
218240	223200	old movie, like I, how can I say this without spoiling too much, but okay, y'all know there's
223200	225600	going to be a light cycle sequence in it, right?
225600	229840	And when they did the whole light cycles, but some of the new stuff they did with it,
229840	234000	like in, like I'm doing hand motions here in studio, like I was just like, oh that is
234000	237080	something that isn't spoiled by the trailers or the commercials.
237080	239780	I know, but I'm trying to be good.
239780	244040	If you actually go look on the Tron Wiki, they do explain that they're all different
244040	245040	models.
245040	247200	Here's the interesting though, just kind of tie it back to what we're all about here at
247200	248200	OLR.
248200	254000	It made me want to play the game like really bad, and the game has not been kindly treated
254000	256320	by the critics out there.
256320	262960	It's been getting like average reviews, and when I say average, I mean like a six, which
262960	263960	I don't know.
263960	267080	Usually when a game gets a six, that means it's really bad.
267080	271320	But of course, the movie is only getting like a 40% or something on Rotten Tomatoes.
271320	272960	This is not a movie for critics.
272960	274880	It's not going to win Oscars.
274880	279640	The dialogue and story are all nerd service, but I honestly think like I walked out of
279640	282500	that theater, I was just like mind blown.
282500	289160	This is a movie worthy of like Star Wars, Star Trek nerd opus, you know.
289160	295920	And on top of that, if you have seen the first movie several times and know it very well,
295920	302120	and if you've kept up with some of the roundabout stuff, even some of the old deleted scenes,
302120	304440	there is a lot in this that makes sense.
304440	307280	And you know, I actually went back and was listening to the soundtrack a bit, because
307280	312560	keep in mind, I have like the original soundtrack for the original Tron.
312560	314400	Oh, but the new soundtrack.
314400	318720	When I went back and gave it a solid listen, some of the elements, especially for character
318720	324000	theme songs, were incorporated from the original into the new.
324000	328200	I just have to say Daft Punk did an astounding job.
328200	331840	And I realized like when people listen to the soundtrack the first time, they're like,
331840	333760	this isn't like a Daft Punk album.
333760	340320	But like the music was like a good, like 80% of the reason why the movie kicked ass so
340320	341320	much.
341320	345000	Honestly, even though I say it's not like an Oscar caliber movie, this movie ought to
345000	347360	be getting nominated for at least some of the technical effects.
347360	349560	And seriously, I am not lying.
349560	350920	And I'm not being a fanboy.
350920	355680	It would be a crime if Daft Punk didn't get nominated for the score, because it adds that
355680	357160	much to the movie.
357160	362760	Like we don't need some artsy fartsy film, stealing one of the nominations for score,
362760	365560	you know, that's kind of like the same old, same old that you always hear in a period
365560	366600	piece.
366600	368120	This is something like really new and different.
368120	369120	I really hope it gets acknowledged.
369120	371300	I'm going to spoil one thing.
371300	372600	There's nothing after the credits.
372600	373600	Oh yeah.
373600	374600	Okay.
374600	375600	That's not much of a spoiler.
375600	376600	Yeah.
376600	379920	But you know what else I really like too is how they gave the Disney castle the Tron treatment.
379920	380920	Oh, it's awesome.
380920	381920	That's so cool.
381920	385880	I really want to go see the Disney electronica thing, which I still haven't seen.
385880	387700	I have friends there right now.
387700	389800	We were supposed to go this weekend, but it just didn't work out.
389800	390800	I'm glad we didn't.
390800	391800	You know why?
391800	392800	It was a cold damn weekend.
392800	393800	It got rained.
393800	394800	They shut most of it down.
394800	399280	But, uh, yeah, I had friends that went down there and they still had a good time, so I'm
399280	400280	glad to hear it.
400280	404320	I'm, I'm bummed I didn't go, but at the same time, I had a great time at the movie.
404320	405640	Just awesome time.
405640	407200	I went and saw it at the Metreon.
407200	408560	Remember the Metreon?
408560	410120	Oh, the poor, poor Metreon.
410120	414200	Or now that the lights are burned out, it's the Me-re-on.
414200	415600	So I went to the Me-re-on to see the movie.
415600	420000	And if you don't know what the Me-re-on is, it's a building in San Francisco and it used
420000	422280	to house the official PlayStation Store.
422280	425920	And so you'd see a lot of events would be happening at the Me-re-on, uh, where they
425920	427800	would have like a line going out and everything.
427800	429520	Well, the Sony store is gone.
429520	433480	It closed down, I think, last year and now it's an art gallery of some sort, I think.
433480	434480	I have no idea.
434480	435480	Yeah.
435480	436720	They think that's what it was when I walked by.
436720	442740	Um, there's still an arcade in the movie theater and there was a arcade upstairs, the Tilt
442740	447040	Arcade, which is right by the Walk of Game, which is still there.
447040	450320	The, there's, I don't think they've updated it in a while, but it's still there.
450320	454440	And uh, yeah, it's kind of sad cause they're selling all these arcade machines, but seriously,
454440	455560	some awesome deals.
455560	459440	There's a Marvel versus Capcom machine for $300 on sale right now.
459440	462680	Um, a BeatMania 5th Mix, which is like the old school movie.
462680	464720	Don't tell anybody cause I'm going to buy it.
464720	465720	For $5,000.
465720	467440	It's a total rip off.
467440	469440	That is ridiculous.
469440	470440	That is ridiculous.
470440	471440	I'm lying.
471440	473400	I'm totally lying.
473400	475240	It's really this much.
475240	476240	That's it.
476240	477240	Yeah.
477240	478240	But Jamie wants it.
478240	479240	So I'm not allowed to tell the listeners.
479240	480240	No you're not.
480240	485440	Um, so yeah, uh, there's that and uh, oh, this was the funniest thing of all though.
485440	487040	Going to the little claw or what?
487040	488040	Not the claw machine.
488040	491900	You ever seen the ticket redemption machine where the light kind of goes around the marquee
491900	494800	and you have to hit the stop button at a certain time and if you hit a stop button, then you
494800	495800	win a prize?
495800	496800	Okay.
496800	497800	I posted this to my Twitter.
497800	499160	Do you know what one of the prizes was in there?
499160	501240	Still in a sealed box.
501240	505480	A Game Boy Advance e-reader machine with cards.
505480	510320	That might be a collector's item.
510320	512480	I lolled so hard seeing that.
512480	518360	It's on my Twitter at twitter.com slash sky S K I E. So anyway, um, let's talk about our
518360	519360	gaming weeks.
519360	520360	Okay.
520360	521360	We're done with Tron talk.
521360	524080	Even though I actually really want to play the game now after seeing the movie, like
524080	526600	even though I hear it's really repetitive, like that's his biggest problem.
526600	530600	Like just, I just want to know more about the story like, and I can't, I think everybody
530600	534000	after going to see the movie that I went and saw it with yesterday, like went online and
534000	538000	started reading about Tron and like who the actors were in the movie and how it tied into
538000	539000	the eighties version.
539000	540560	It's just, is that nerd-tastic?
540560	542000	All right.
542000	543000	How was your gaming week?
543000	545840	Dark soccer, actual video games outside of Tron.
545840	551120	Well, I, um, I'm playing world of Warcraft addict.
551120	552120	No I'm not.
552120	557040	No, I'm not because I'm still, I'm still playing Star Trek online and you can call me an addict
557040	558040	for that.
558040	559400	Double addict.
559400	566880	I'm not addicted, but I said I'd give it a chance and I was like, I was seriously this
566880	569800	close again to just going, forget it.
569800	574200	Like by this close, I mean like holding my fingers, you know, a half an inch apart is
574200	577640	like stupid goat people world sucks.
577640	583120	Even though I like playing goat people, but I'm leveling faster, so I don't know what's
583120	584120	up with that.
584120	588760	Um, but it was, it's cool, you know, chatting with everyone in the guild and everything
588760	590560	and that's pretty fun.
590560	595640	Um, it still seems like more of the same to me, you know, but I'm giving it a chance.
595640	596640	I'm somewhere new.
596640	598640	I'm playing.
598640	599640	Rob gave me some stuff.
599640	602080	I'll give you lots of stuff.
602080	605160	You have to play for a good month now.
605160	606280	But isn't it good to be back?
606280	610340	Well, I would ask you what you think of it, but because you've been playing a Draenei,
610340	614560	you've really only seen the content that's in Burning Crusade, which I understand you
614560	616320	should do what you want to do.
616320	621160	Like don't roll another race just because it's somewhere else, but I helped you get
621160	622160	somewhere else.
622160	623160	So hopefully you'll be able to see some new content.
623160	624160	And it still looks the same too.
624160	625160	Well.
625160	627560	Well, I mean, I didn't make it there last time.
627560	629240	I'm in, what's the name of the stupid-
629240	630240	Darnassus.
630240	631240	Darnassus.
631240	632240	Okay.
632240	633240	It still looks like night elf stuff.
633240	634240	Right.
634240	635240	And Darnassus wasn't touched by Deathwing too.
635240	636240	You have to, cause it's-
636240	637920	He didn't take a big poop on it?
637920	638920	He didn't.
638920	644360	But once you take the boat to the ruins of Albertine, which used to be Albertine, uh,
644360	647440	you'll start to see some of the damage and some of the better stuff, I think.
647440	651080	I figured that I'm going to do that when I get like 20 and I'm like, what, 14 now and
651080	652080	I've been playing three days.
652080	653080	Yeah.
653080	654080	You've been doing very well.
654080	660920	Which it took me two weeks to get to 20 last time.
660920	666440	So I'm, I'm, I'm going to keep going with it.
666440	672640	I mean, I'll try, but like, like I said, you know, it's not something that I can keep doing
672640	673640	consistently.
673640	679280	I'm keeping my attachment to Star Trek Online, which by the way, episode three Star Trek
679280	680600	Online came out.
680600	681600	Gorgeous.
681600	682600	Gorgeous.
682600	683600	Gorgeous.
683600	687240	Once a cataclysm or cataclysm, whatever you want to call it, uh, settles down a little
687240	688240	bit.
688240	691320	That's a internet meme, by the way, if you don't know, uh, once that settles down a little
691320	693960	bit, I still want to go back and check out Star Trek Online.
693960	698640	Hopefully DC Universe isn't out by that point and kind of derails everything, but I still
698640	701680	want to go check it out a little bit, especially since they've changed so much, it sounds like
701680	703760	since the beta that I originally had played.
703760	708520	Well, and you know, I kind of, I'd like to try out the, the new stuff, but I'm not going
708520	713600	to buy two boxes of upgrades unless I'm sure I'm going to play a little bit more.
713600	714600	I don't blame it.
714600	718840	And even then, you know, if I play, it's going to have to be in the form of, you know, month
718840	719960	cards or something.
719960	722880	It's still ridiculous that they're charging so much for Wrath of the Lich King.
722880	726800	And I think that will come down, just kind of have to wait it out after, probably after
726800	730320	the Christmas rush or something, it'll, it'll come down to try and woo new players into
730320	731320	the game.
731320	733280	Well, that's, that's kind of what I'm hoping for.
733280	735080	I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to give up on it.
735080	740040	I mean, like I said, if, if I keep playing it, it's going to be, well, I'll buy, um,
740040	744220	you know, a month card to play because I'm not getting rid of my Star Trek Online subscription
744220	748640	unless STO just starts getting ridiculously crappy.
748640	752720	And right now though, my frustration with Star Trek Online is that there's really not
752720	758040	a whole lot of new stuff for new characters and I want new factions.
758040	763600	We're supposed, they sort of teased that we're supposed to be getting, um, Cardassian faction
763600	765440	so I can keep up with the Cardassians.
765440	768160	Wow, that's a bad joke.
768160	770720	I'm not the first one to think of it either.
770720	775800	Um, you know, I want to play, you know, the Romulan stuff that, you know, they're doing
775800	781320	a lot of big stories for the Romulan factions and I really, really like what they're doing
781320	786220	with the story because they're putting something in it for everybody and it's like, it really
786220	787560	does have a feeling for me.
787560	791040	Like I'll be chatting with Becky and we'll be talking about Deep Space Nine or something
791040	793940	because that's, you know, right now both of us are going back and just rewatching all
793940	798800	of Deep Space Nine in parts and, which would be like the 50 millionth time I've watched
798800	801560	everything through on Deep Space Nine because it's my favorite.
801560	806360	But like, um, I'll say, oh, and by the way, they did this in Star Trek Online and this,
806360	808440	this led to this story and this.
808440	812160	And she's like, sounds like you're talking like, you know, well, she hasn't said right
812160	816600	out, but I feel like I'm talking about an episode and when they actually, when they
816600	821640	bring everything up, it's like the way everything flows is like an episode of the show just
821640	822640	without acting.
822640	826000	That's good because just as someone who is a fan of the Star Trek series, Not Counting
826000	832440	Enterprise, um, I, I really wish they would have another show, you know, I really want
832440	835640	there to be another TV show and I understand that right now it's like all about the movies
835640	841720	and don't even know that new movie was awesome, but I would just love there to be a new show
841720	845880	in the next gen Voyager canon, Deep Space Nine canon.
845880	851560	You know, I would like, um, well, you know, and I've been going back and reading the books,
851560	857360	the, you know, the continuation books, which is really where, and this is going to be kind
857360	862200	of a, I'm going to try not to veer too off the point, the, the book universe is very
862200	864800	different than the game universe.
864800	867760	The book universe is sort of like it's its own tangent.
867760	872320	Um, what I like about the game universe is that it incorporated the first movie by saying
872320	881200	that this is what happened in the prime timeline and the movie, as I said, is a new timeline
881200	885320	so they can keep going with all these characters that you love and, you know, history that
885320	887120	you know.
887120	895000	And I'd really like to see, you know, even them do like a comic series or new series,
895000	898240	you know, involving the Star Trek online universe or maybe the stuff that happened in between.
898240	899240	Who knows?
899240	900240	Anything's possible.
900240	904040	Cause I love it and even, and they've, they've incorporated some of the enterprise stuff
904040	905040	in there too.
905040	912020	You know, even though I think it's kind of crappy, but um, it's, I've been very, very
912020	915840	happy with Star Trek online, but like I said, I'm giving world of war crack a try.
915840	918360	Um, I like my goat girl.
918360	921440	She's dressed like a hoochie right now, but she can burn things.
921440	922600	There you go.
922600	927160	I do like, and I think this is new, the arcane missile thing.
927160	930200	It's not new, but you, it's new for me.
930200	934520	They, everything is at different levels now, so you might be getting it sooner than you
934520	935520	would have before.
935520	940440	Cause they rearranged everything when they did cataclysm and like some people get talents
940440	944240	at a really early level that they wouldn't have seen till like level 40 before this.
944240	947880	This arcane missile thing, they're just like, here, have this for free.
947880	949200	What?
949200	950640	And you don't have to, it's just random.
950640	957120	You can randomly cast it and it doesn't cost anything and it's instant and you can kill
957120	958120	lots of stuff with it.
958120	961480	If you're thinking you specced for it somehow, so that's kinda, yeah, usually those free
961480	965160	things are usually some type of speccing, but yeah, that's spending talent points.
965160	966160	You spent your talent points.
966160	971240	I had it before I got my talent points and then, so I don't play a mage, so I have no
971240	972240	idea how it works.
972240	975280	And then I'll double check my stuff real quick cause it's not going to screw up the show
975280	981080	or anything, but it's like, well, I did pick arcane path, but I had everything before that.
981080	985240	I think it's important for, I mean, I don't want to veer off the path too much and talk
985240	986240	to my pet.
986240	987500	I don't know how to get it.
987500	994240	But I do think it's important for wow veterans to hear how newbies approach wow, because
994240	998080	I think sometimes the wow veterans just assume people come into wow and they know everything
998080	999440	and it's, it's hard.
999440	1001220	There's a lot to the game.
1001220	1004880	So I think it's important that, you know, if you're a veteran of wow, you sometimes
1004880	1008220	kind of hear what the new people are really thinking and some of the challenges and so
1008220	1009220	forth.
1009220	1014000	I'm not exactly new, but I didn't, but going on a hiatus, as long as you have with all
1014000	1015740	the changes, it's, it's new to you.
1015740	1018760	That's about an average though, every time I've gone on hiatus, I've taken about a year
1018760	1019760	off.
1019760	1023360	You know, I think last time I played was in February and then I quit when Star Trek online
1023360	1024360	came out.
1024360	1028720	So I think I actually just paid for another month so that a TR could get a free month.
1028720	1029720	Nice.
1029720	1031160	Which I'm very sorry that didn't work out for you.
1031160	1035120	I thought that I could use another scroll, but they said, yeah, it's only one for account
1035120	1036120	ever.
1036120	1037120	I'm sorry.
1037120	1038120	Uh, let me look at chat room really quick.
1038120	1042520	Cause we want to get some questions out chat.orangelaunchradio.com a quick question from break man.
1042520	1045800	Are the star Trek cartoons canon?
1045800	1046800	Yes, actually.
1046800	1049320	Um, the animated series is considered canon.
1049320	1050320	All right.
1050320	1054440	Uh, break man is also asking, do newbies still have to go find that wife in the barons?
1054440	1055560	I don't think so.
1055560	1057520	I don't play horde, so I'm not sure.
1057520	1063540	Uh, but I believe due to the stupid mushrooms due to the shift, the mushrooms due to the
1063540	1069720	shift of a burning crusade, or I'm sorry, due to the shift of, of Southern barons being
1069720	1070720	its own zone.
1070720	1073120	I don't believe that quest is there anymore.
1073120	1075240	Stupid, stupid mushrooms.
1075240	1077200	See that hasn't changed, but you'll get there.
1077200	1078200	You'll get there.
1078200	1079200	Yeah.
1079200	1080200	And then someone had to start in badger badger, Rob.
1080200	1081200	All right.
1081200	1082640	I was already in my head.
1082640	1083640	Let's move on.
1083640	1084840	Loki, is there any games you've been playing?
1084840	1086400	I know you don't play any MMOs right now.
1086400	1088040	So what, what have you been up to?
1088040	1094600	Um, I've been just playing grand theft auto and um, swords and poker or sword and poker
1094600	1095600	too.
1095600	1101160	I'm playing lots of sword and poker too.
1101160	1104880	And I did actually play a little bit of, now it's a little confusing because I have both
1104880	1105960	Tron games.
1105960	1110240	I have the Tron legacy game and then also the Tron game, but I played Tron legacy a
1110240	1118480	little bit and it's, it's all right if you, um, you race around in light cycles and um,
1118480	1119480	the recognizers.
1119480	1126320	Yeah, I just don't like tilt steering.
1126320	1129320	I hate tilt steering and everything.
1129320	1132000	It's just, it's not, it doesn't feel natural.
1132000	1134960	So you must be playing it on PS3 with the six axis or what?
1134960	1135960	No on the iPod.
1135960	1136960	Oh, okay.
1136960	1139480	I thought these were the retail games.
1139480	1141000	No, no, no, no.
1141000	1146000	Um, no, it's just a tilt steering on the iPod to steer the bike.
1146000	1147400	I hate that.
1147400	1148640	Oh, okay.
1148640	1149640	Got it.
1149640	1155560	I prefer like, you know, my finger, um, yeah, that's pretty much it.
1155560	1157680	I think I didn't play a whole lot.
1157680	1160520	It's too busy yelling at Comcast.
1160520	1163440	Oh, the internet's been down for still right.
1163440	1165920	You were down last week and you're still down, right?
1165920	1166920	They're dumb.
1166920	1167920	Okay.
1167920	1168920	They're dumb.
1168920	1172120	We'll just put it that way.
1172120	1178080	And no Comcast really doesn't care despite the fact, you know what certain Twitter people
1178080	1183360	will say, um, and how they may seem concerned and ask you to email them and then they don't
1183360	1184940	give a shit once you've emailed them.
1184940	1187680	So you mad?
1187680	1194860	Just slightly canceling TV with them actually because I'm pretty pissed off and it's not
1194860	1198680	working all the way too because I can't use any of the on-demand stuff because the signal's
1198680	1199680	not strong enough.
1199680	1200680	That sucks.
1200680	1202680	Sorry to hear it.
1202680	1207500	Thankfully, thank you to my new Virgin mobile phone though that I have rooted.
1207500	1211740	I can now tie into the Wi-Fi and that's a connected 3G network.
1211740	1215360	So that has been a lifesaver I tell you.
1215360	1217420	There you go.
1217420	1222120	My gaming week has been mostly dominated with World of Warcraft cataclysm.
1222120	1226800	I won't kind of go all the way back into it, but I hit level 85, which is the new max level
1226800	1228960	this week, so shut.
1228960	1229960	So that's good.
1229960	1232880	I've been just trying to gear for heroics and I am geared for heroics now, so I'll be
1232880	1234360	doing that soon.
1234360	1239200	As far as other games go, not anything new, just some of the same old standbys like Rock
1239200	1243480	Band 3, Super Meat Boy, and some of those games I've just been playing gradually over
1243480	1245640	the past month, but not a whole lot.
1245640	1249480	As you know, with the holidays coming up and everything, my gaming time has been kind of
1249480	1250480	thin.
1250480	1254120	But the good news is, with the huge break coming up, I don't know about some of you
1254120	1260780	out there, but I have been given at work basically the entire time between Christmas and New
1260780	1262000	Year's off.
1262000	1266600	Our company does this whole closure thing where we have to take time off basically,
1266600	1270560	which is, you know, I'm not gonna lie, I kind of welcome it, so it's gonna be a nice break.
1270560	1273840	But I don't know what to do with myself for like nine days off in a row.
1273840	1278020	I can't really afford to take any major trips right now, so I guess I'll sit at home and
1278020	1279240	play some games.
1279240	1282120	So that's good though, because I really need to just catch up on some things.
1282120	1284960	So hopefully I'll get some gift cards for Christmas or something, I can go buy myself
1284960	1287120	a couple new games, and beat them!
1287120	1289060	That'd be great.
1289060	1290760	So anyway, that does it for our gaming week.
1290760	1294960	I hope you guys are having a lot of fun this week, and for the holidays, some of you guys
1294960	1297120	get some new games that you can play through.
1297120	1301480	You have to tell us all about it at chat.orangelauncheradio.com.
1301480	1305140	Ziba in the chatroom says, my job does the same thing.
1305140	1307360	It's not totally unheard of.
1307360	1312500	DarkCircuitry in the chatroom says, internet equals Warcraft equals Rob's life at least.
1312500	1313500	Not totally.
1313500	1316840	I mean, yeah, I spend a lot of my free time playing Warcraft, but let's not forget, it
1316840	1318760	just had a major expansion.
1318760	1322860	It's third expansion just came out like last week, so of course, you know, that's kind
1322860	1326760	of the focus right now, but you know, that'll die down once I've really experienced a lot
1326760	1327760	of the new stuff.
1327760	1332240	I don't really plan on rolling an alt or getting through all that and all that, so I'll have
1332240	1333600	time to play a new game.
1333600	1338320	And yes, I know how to go outdoors, I was in the city all weekend, so I do more than
1338320	1342480	just sit on the computer and play WoW, but that is a lot of what I do, it's fun.
1342480	1347440	Alright, anyhow, housekeeping, there is no show next week.
1347440	1351800	We will not be having a show on the 26th due to the holidays, DarkCircuitry's gonna be
1351800	1352800	out of town.
1352800	1353800	Where are you going?
1353800	1354800	You're going way up.
1354800	1355800	Going to Washington.
1355800	1356800	Washington, Washington!
1356800	1357800	But not Seattle, right?
1357800	1358800	You're going to...
1358800	1360160	No, I'm going to Prosser.
1360160	1362920	Which is more in the middle of nowhere or is it kind of a big city?
1362920	1363920	Yeah.
1363920	1364920	Okay, well...
1364920	1365920	It's teeny.
1365920	1366920	Very farmy.
1366920	1367920	Have fun in the farm town.
1367920	1368920	I'm growing in my netbook.
1368920	1370400	There you go.
1370400	1372860	Stay connected.
1372860	1376160	And yeah, we'll just, you know, Loki and I will just be taking some time off for the
1376160	1379960	holidays so we won't be here, but we will be back the week after in the new year with
1379960	1380960	a new show.
1380960	1385080	Otherwise, if you want to follow us on Twitter for all the updates about our show, twitter.com
1385080	1389960	slash o-l-r, we'll also be taking your Twitter topics there, facebook.com slash orange lounge
1389960	1393000	radio as well.
1393000	1396080	More comments from our chat room, chat dot orange lounge radio dot com.
1396080	1399160	Tiger Claw says, Sky will just play Cataclysm for nine days.
1399160	1401280	No, I'm not going to play for nine days straight.
1401280	1405040	I'm not going to lie, I'm going to play a lot with the time off, I'm not going to play
1405040	1406520	the whole time, come on.
1406520	1411920	Besides, I have Knights of the Clicky on Facebook I've got to be playing too.
1411920	1414860	Someone sent me an invite to that, no thanks.
1414860	1416240	It's a real time waster.
1416240	1421480	Jim Sally in our chat room says, if you're bored next week, Rob, do a show every day.
1421480	1423080	There's three hours taken care of.
1423080	1427520	That'd be kind of fun, but I don't know, I think I'd run out of things to talk about
1427520	1429280	and then we get kind of scary.
1429280	1431080	Would the listeners help me do a show?
1431080	1432080	I don't know.
1432080	1437440	I'm talking about all the stuff coming out, oh, wait, no, no.
1437440	1441740	There's already a bunch of live shows at All Games Radio where we do our show and obviously
1441740	1445160	we wouldn't want to bump any of those shows, we don't have the right to.
1445160	1453120	There's plenty of fine shows on the network, so let them do their thing and we'll see.
1453120	1456960	William Murderface in our chat room says, I love that name by the way, Rob, you need
1456960	1460520	a drunken Rocky marathon.
1460520	1464520	I don't know, I've been doing Rocky for so long now, I don't think I need to marathon
1464520	1465520	it.
1465520	1467760	There you go.
1467760	1471280	And JV Monner in our chat room says, oh yeah, more people need to play Pinball FX2.
1471280	1472280	Agreed.
1472280	1474480	Pinball FX2 is great.
1474480	1476880	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1476880	1478920	Let's go to some gaming news.
1478920	1481920	Believe it or not, there is still some going on this week, even though it is the holiday
1481920	1482920	period.
1482920	1483920	Loki.
1483920	1490060	Yes, so apparently Microsoft is wanting, obviously, to improve upon what they've already created.
1490060	1495680	They want to quadruple the Kinect's accuracy, and the way they're going to do that is by
1495680	1504960	unrestricted the camera from the 320 by 240 pixel resolution to unlock it to 640 by 480,
1504960	1509840	and unfortunately they can't do that right now because of the limitations put on by the
1509840	1517560	console's USB controller interface, which has to keep open enough to support other USB
1517560	1524320	based peripherals like batteries and rechargers, but if they somehow enable it to where, you
1524320	1533240	know, they would limit you to so many devices or whatever plugged in via USB, then they
1533240	1538200	would be able to unlock the bandwidth to be able to stream more data from the Kinect and
1538200	1544120	allowing you to basically quadruple the resolution of the camera, so it'd be able to detect,
1544120	1547600	they said, even like finger movements and stuff like that, that can't be done right
1547600	1548600	now.
1548600	1551480	So that's kind of cool, and they said that can all be accomplished with a firmware update,
1551480	1555720	so that is kind of cool and kind of makes you wonder why it wasn't there in the first
1555720	1556720	place.
1556720	1559840	Well, they said right there it's because of the limitations of the console, because right
1559840	1565400	now they have to, you know, they have to play nice with all the other peripherals on there.
1565400	1569760	I don't under, well, I mean, I guess the USB controller, so I was gonna say I don't understand
1569760	1576120	why they couldn't just unrestricted the one port for the Kinect, but I don't know, it
1576120	1579320	would be difficult to do that.
1579320	1584000	As long as whatever they do doesn't impact the older consoles, like, that's my fear,
1584000	1586720	is that, you know, as they keep talking about, we're gonna upgrade all this stuff for firmware,
1586720	1591440	we're gonna do all these upgrades, oh, but if you have the old white Xboxes, then you're
1591440	1592440	fucked.
1592440	1593440	Well, all you need is...
1593440	1594440	It's only gonna work with the 360Ss.
1594440	1598880	You just need the adapter that comes with it, but I think that's just, that's just for
1598880	1599880	power.
1599880	1603320	I mean, they had the data, they just had more power coming through there.
1603320	1608040	I guess what they could do is say, okay, you know, when running the Kinect, you can only
1608040	1612360	hook up, like, you know, one device or two devices or something like that.
1612360	1617060	Maybe that's the way they could get around it, or, I don't know.
1617060	1621640	It's a little tricky, but I could see them doing it, especially if it's gonna make things
1621640	1624340	that much better.
1624340	1630440	But at the same time, we really need the games to be four times better anyways.
1630440	1632640	At least, you know, some of them.
1632640	1637520	Well, I'm not convinced, I'm not convinced that even if you make the technology better,
1637520	1643120	that there's enough games with really new ideas there yet to substantiate it, if that
1643120	1644120	makes sense?
1644120	1645120	Yeah.
1645120	1648440	Like, you know, Dance Central is awesome, but, you know, as far as a lot of those other
1648440	1654720	adventures and those sorts of games go, the fitness games, I'm kind of over it.
1654720	1661920	Like, you know, show me how Kinect is going to make my life as a gamer even more awesomer,
1661920	1665960	and yes, that's a term, more awesomer.
1665960	1668880	You know, show me how Kinect's gonna do that.
1668880	1674160	Kinect is still kind of a flashy thing right now.
1674160	1678960	I haven't seen it really truly integrated into the hardcore games that I'm used to.
1678960	1679960	You know what I mean?
1679960	1681340	Yeah, I know what you mean.
1681340	1686700	So at one point, I'm kind of like, don't waste your time with this upgrade to the technology
1686700	1691060	unless you have the games to kind of back that up that aren't just more exercise games
1691060	1692360	and more dance games.
1692360	1697960	Well, I think they're just working on, you know, having that available for when they
1697960	1701880	do get to that point as far as game development goes, because yeah, some of the stuff that
1701880	1706080	is available right now, it's very basic with what they have you doing.
1706080	1713160	You know, Dance Central's a pretty good example of what it can do, but some other games that
1713160	1717080	kind of just have these modes tacked on like Harry Potter and stuff where it's just an
1717080	1720600	on rails thing that you, it's very unnecessary.
1720600	1724360	I mean, I don't know.
1724360	1734120	They need less like, you know, fitness games, less snowboarding-esque games, just some better
1734120	1735120	ideas.
1735120	1738440	Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
1738440	1742200	Derek H. wants to give a cheap plug to connectable.net.
1742200	1743600	Games are only scratching the surface.
1743600	1744600	You know, that's a good thought.
1744600	1746760	I'm looking at some of the stuff here that they have, and of course I've been kind of
1746760	1750960	reading about the hacks on the internet, and this website connectable.net seems to be kind
1750960	1755280	of a collection of the different sorts of hacks that are out there, like lots of YouTubes,
1755280	1760920	and I'm seeing things like an air piano where you can use your hand to play the piano on
1760920	1761920	connectable.
1761920	1765880	I mean, it's not exactly like a real piano, but still it's an impressive little thing
1765880	1768600	that they're doing with the technology.
1768600	1774260	You gotta wonder if Microsoft's kind of letting this hack thing go a little bit just to see
1774260	1776600	what people are coming up with so they can steal it.
1776600	1777600	You know what I want?
1777600	1778600	Hmm?
1778600	1779600	The Kinect experiment.
1779600	1784440	No, seriously, this is me being serious, because I really want a Theremin.
1784440	1785440	Maybe Kinect music.
1785440	1786440	Why not?
1786440	1788240	Since there was Wii music, let's have Kinect music.
1788240	1790320	And actually have it be good?
1790320	1791380	Perhaps.
1791380	1795360	Let's not, because once again we've figured out that, you know, porting stuff over from
1795360	1800320	the Wii or, you know, basically copying the ideas that you've done on the Wii, not exactly
1800320	1804840	a great plan, because then a lot of these games just come out very cheesy.
1804840	1812360	I mean, even some of the games are just, I mean, like Deca Sports and Game Party, I mean,
1812360	1814800	it's just, that's stuff that they have on the Wii right now.
1814800	1820200	We don't need a, you know, ton of mini game collections and little sports compilations
1820200	1821200	and stuff like that.
1821200	1825560	Just come up with something, something cool, you know?
1825560	1829800	And something, something that doesn't even necessarily need to use your whole body, like
1829800	1832840	head tracking in a first person shooter would be pretty awesome.
1832840	1834760	That would be actually really awesome.
1834760	1837840	You know, it's completely optional.
1837840	1838840	Like to duck?
1838840	1839840	You have to duck.
1839840	1840840	And you should like do that on your couch.
1840840	1841840	No, not even.
1841840	1842840	That's, that's dumb.
1842840	1843840	Really?
1843840	1844840	Not even the ducking thing.
1844840	1848960	But I'm saying like, you could poke your head a little bit to the side to kind of get a
1848960	1849960	different perspective.
1849960	1851600	It's just a little bit more immersive.
1851600	1854640	Wouldn't take that much, you know, technology.
1854640	1855640	And you know...
1855640	1858920	Could you imagine time crisis done with head tracking?
1858920	1862200	It would be cool, but I'm kind of sick of time crisis.
1862200	1866920	I mean, I'm just saying, I'm taking that concept to where, you know, say that you duck under,
1866920	1872480	you know, a divider and you can peek over it and that type of thing.
1872480	1875360	But I'm just trying to think of a solution for like, you know, people that want to play
1875360	1878720	with controllers on a, you know, on a couch or something like that.
1878720	1881560	And they can make everything very minimal and optional.
1881560	1886760	I mean, you don't have to have, say like for the next Gears of War game or something like
1886760	1888120	that, could have head tracking.
1888120	1890080	And that would be the extent of the Kinect support.
1890080	1896000	None of this, move your arm in like a karate chop to cut through, you know, enemy.
1896000	1897000	I don't know.
1897000	1900920	Here's a really interesting comment from chat from chat.orangelodgevideo.com.
1900920	1904040	Ray Craft says, time crisis with head tracking.
1904040	1907000	Yeah, that's called Police 911.
1907000	1910680	Very interesting comment because yeah, Police 911 used a dance games technology.
1910680	1915200	It was basically Para Para Paradise, you know, the setup to kind of do this different sort
1915200	1916200	of game.
1916200	1917200	What was mocap?
1917200	1918200	All the like mocap boxing and all that.
1918200	1919200	Yeah, the whole mocap thing.
1919200	1922800	That was the same theory, but I'm saying that now with the Kinect, something like that is
1922800	1923800	actually really possible.
1923800	1924800	Sure.
1924800	1927960	Just like, you know, Para Para is possible in the home, but that's, that's that dance
1927960	1929040	masters game.
1929040	1930040	Which I need to get.
1930040	1931040	Yeah.
1931040	1934240	Cause I, Oh, I forgot to mention that for my thing, but I got to connect for December
1934240	1935240	ween.
1935240	1936240	Congrats.
1936240	1937240	Yay.
1937240	1938240	All right.
1938240	1939240	For Festivus?
1939240	1940240	December ween.
1940240	1941240	Is that what you call it?
1941240	1942240	I'm going to call it December ween.
1942240	1943240	December ween.
1943240	1944240	Awesome.
1944240	1945240	All right.
1945240	1946240	Chat.orangelodgevideo.com.
1946240	1951200	If you want to lend your own comments, lots of comments there, just kind of, um, on that
1951200	1952200	story.
1952200	1953200	I like that.
1953200	1954200	Well, let's go back to talking about wow for a minute.
1954200	1955200	Sorry guys.
1955200	1958000	But you know, I know some of you are wow haters and that's fine.
1958000	1961800	People are going to like what they like, but you can't ignore this world of Warcraft shatters
1961800	1968160	a record this week yet again, and probably to no one's surprise cataclysm is sold 3.3
1968160	1975200	million units within 24 hours of its release becoming the fastest selling PC game of all
1975200	1976200	time.
1976200	1980560	The game that it beat of course was Wrath of the Lich King World of Warcraft 2.8 million
1980560	1982680	copies back in 2008.
1982680	1986320	They didn't say how much of that 3.3 million was digital.
1986320	1989960	This was of course the first expansion that Blizzard had launched digitally, which was
1989960	1993880	a little bit of a controversy in some ways because, uh, you know, all those midnight
1993880	1998000	launches certainly had a few less people at them due to the digital launch.
1998000	2002200	But what I think is very interesting about this is I think it shows you that of those
2002200	2008960	12 million subscribers or whatever, 3.3 million are pretty hardcore because they all had to
2008960	2013880	have the game the first day and I totally admit that I fall into that category.
2013880	2019080	But it's left a lot of people asking like, well, where does the other 9 million go?
2019080	2022680	And I'm wondering, well, has cataclysm launched in every country?
2022680	2026680	But certainly there's a gap there and I think that's only day one, I think too.
2026680	2031320	I mean, some people, you know, couldn't make it over the day or waited a little bit or
2031320	2032720	they're getting it as a gift.
2032720	2036160	And I think some people are honestly having to wait like a month because, you know, the
2036160	2040440	economy the way it is, I know there's certain people in my guild that are like, uh, not
2040440	2044360	going to be doing cataclysm until the new year at least because just can't afford it.
2044360	2045360	It's too much.
2045360	2048080	So, you know, I think there's a lot of people that just don't do it.
2048080	2052000	Or is cataclysm like a lot of that stuff like end game because I could see maybe some people
2052000	2054780	just starting off, they're saying, eh, I don't need it.
2054780	2061080	A lot of it is because the stuff that affected the pre-end game, you know, the zero to 60
2061080	2064320	experience, you don't need this expansion to experience any of that.
2064320	2069400	That was all a free upgrade basically because they destroyed the old world and ushered in
2069400	2070960	this new one.
2070960	2077340	However, the whole Worgen and Goblin experience, which are really well done starting areas
2077340	2081960	just as far as like immersing in story and everything, you can't do unless you have cataclysm.
2081960	2088480	So you can't do those new races, but you know, you can still roll a Draenei like Dark Soccer
2088480	2092920	is and at level 15 or whatever, head over to the other continent and experience some
2092920	2096600	of the cataclysm stuff without really needing the cataclysm expansion.
2096600	2099120	So kind of interesting.
2099120	2103880	Other important news out of Blizzard and this isn't about WoW, but this could be about what
2103880	2105680	ends up killing WoW.
2105680	2106680	That's right.
2106680	2109480	Blizzard might actually be making the game that is going to kill WoW.
2109480	2111520	They're making their own WoW killer.
2111520	2117980	Frank Pierce in an interview with Destructoid confirmed that the earlier rumor was true
2117980	2121980	that the next MMO that they are making is called Titan.
2121980	2124080	At least right now that's a code name.
2124080	2127680	That doesn't mean that's the finalized release name of the game.
2127680	2128920	That's just the code name.
2128920	2132880	So it also kind of lends a little credit to the fact that that leaked list might have
2132880	2133880	been true.
2133880	2136760	I don't remember if we talked about that leaked list on this show or if that was on Hoardhouse
2136760	2142100	because it's a little more Blizzard centric, but all I can say is that if you've seen that
2142100	2146580	leaked list of release dates and names and so forth, all that shit is subject to change
2146580	2152500	because Blizzard is notorious for saying, we will put it out when it's ready and not
2152500	2153900	a minute before.
2153900	2157280	So you know, take a lot of that with a grain of salt.
2157280	2161920	Anyhow, more quote here in the interview with Destructoid, quote, the media is not supposed
2161920	2163840	to know anything about Titan.
2163840	2169240	It's our next gen MMO and we've only started, excuse me, we've only started talking about
2169240	2172960	it in a limited fashion because we want to leverage the fact that we're working on something
2172960	2176680	like that for the purpose of recruiting, getting some of the best talent of the industry on
2176680	2179120	the product, on the project.
2179120	2185760	So they are up to something, but that something is at least a good three years away, if not
2185760	2187160	more.
2187160	2189200	So enjoy WoW in the meantime.
2189200	2193520	Otherwise, I'm kind of curious as to what this is, but they probably won't even do an
2193520	2198840	announcement until like Blizzcon 2012 or something.
2198840	2200600	It's a ways out there guys.
2200600	2205440	But it's interesting to know that that part of the rumor was true because I think I passed
2205440	2207800	it off on a Hoard House's fan wank.
2207800	2210600	So sometimes I can be wrong about things.
2210600	2212320	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2212320	2213320	Pac-Man Fever.
2213320	2214320	Nah.
2214320	2215320	You remember that song, don't you?
2215320	2216320	That's old school.
2216320	2217320	Yes, I do.
2217320	2218320	Of course I remember that song.
2218320	2219960	Well, so do the folks, um.
2219960	2222200	That song's older than most of our listeners, you know.
2222200	2226360	Well, so the folks at Rock Band, they remember it and actually it came out the same year
2226360	2227360	as Tron.
2227360	2228360	Awesome.
2228360	2229360	Ooh.
2229360	2235200	So the Pac-Man Fever album will be on Rock Band Download Content.
2235200	2240860	And that's supposed to be early 2001 and it will have, as I said, Pac-Man Fever and Do
2240860	2244480	the Donkey Kong and Froggy's Lament.
2244480	2247680	Just so you guys know, these songs were actually kind of terrible.
2247680	2248680	Like-
2248680	2249680	But pull up Pac-Man Fever.
2249680	2250680	Here.
2250680	2262080	Like, you know.
2262080	2265680	But it was, it was popular when it came out, I mean.
2265680	2268640	I remember skating at the roller rate to this song.
2268640	2269640	So do I.
2269640	2277160	I'm totally dating myself, but.
2277160	2280460	This song was really just written, this whole album was just a little like video game tie
2280460	2281460	in song.
2281460	2284080	It was really just written to cash in on the whole craze.
2284080	2286080	One hit Wonderband.
2286080	2287640	You don't want me to find the 7up commercial.
2287640	2289840	I've shown you the 7up commercial.
2289840	2292600	I think, yes, a long time ago on this show, yes.
2292600	2294800	Um, but yeah, it's coming out.
2294800	2295800	I get it.
2295800	2299040	I wouldn't mind having some Pac-Man Fever.
2299040	2301920	It'd be that lol song you pull up at parties.
2301920	2304480	You know, everybody has the lol songs for Rock Band.
2304480	2307480	Like the Cartman version of Poker Face is always a good lol song.
2307480	2308480	You know, I didn't download that.
2308480	2309480	I vetoed that.
2309480	2310480	Really?
2310480	2312240	So, but you know what my song is?
2312240	2314040	Uh, Still Alive from Portal.
2314040	2315400	No, Skullcrusher Mountain.
2315400	2316400	Oh, okay.
2316400	2317400	That's a good lol song.
2317400	2318400	That's a good one.
2318400	2319400	Skullcrusher Mountain.
2319400	2320400	Alright.
2320400	2322400	So there you go.
2322400	2325280	Uh, what?
2325280	2328120	The other songs on the album sound kind of funny.
2328120	2330060	I haven't really heard any of those other ones.
2330060	2332520	It's been ages since I've listened to any of the other ones.
2332520	2336280	I actually did have that on vinyl back in the day.
2336280	2337280	Wow.
2337280	2338680	That's a collector's note.
2338680	2339680	Hold on.
2339680	2341200	Let me pull it up here so you can hear a little bit here.
2341200	2342200	If you want to.
2342200	2343720	Here's a little bit of Do the Donkey Kong.
2343720	2354680	If you want to know what this song is about.
2354680	2356680	I got Pac-Man Fever.
2356680	2357680	Alright.
2357680	2359680	There you go.
2359680	2379400	Um, so when the whole ESPN streaming was announced for, or I should say when it came out as part
2379400	2385560	of the November dashboard update for the Xbox 360, um, some people unfortunately were unable
2385560	2392520	to participate in that streaming and those would be folks that had Bright House, which
2392520	2399000	is owned by Time Warner, as their cable provider.
2399000	2406680	Unfortunately those people were unable to actually get the ESPN app to work correctly.
2406680	2413080	But now it says apparently that this is going to be coming to those people that were unable
2413080	2419080	to have it before, and this is coming from the ESPN website.
2419080	2423760	The way it works, I guess, is when a Time Warner or Bright House user turns on their
2423760	2431780	Xbox 360 and tries to access the ESPN app, it'll direct them to the ESPN activation page
2431780	2436120	where they have to authenticate their account with Bright House or Time Warner.
2436120	2438080	Then it'll be given an access code.
2438080	2444440	Once you have that, you would, um, I guess you're gonna be able to actually use the streaming
2444440	2445440	service now.
2445440	2449200	So that's kinda neat, that they're not locked out of it anymore.
2449200	2451400	Guess some money exchanged hands or something like that.
2451400	2455000	I always thought it was interesting that, like, whenever I would connect to the ESPN
2455000	2460540	live thing, and granted I don't, like, Uber, follow sports and all that, although I won
2460540	2464700	tickets to a Kings game at work, and, like, I'm gonna be, like, right in the front of
2464700	2465700	a section.
2465700	2469120	I'm excited, actually, even though I don't, you know, it's like the two worst teams in
2469120	2470120	the league playing each other.
2470120	2471120	But I don't care!
2471120	2472120	I'm gonna have fun.
2472120	2476360	So the ESPN thing for, like, when I get my once-in-a-great-while basketball thing, I've
2476360	2479800	looked at it, like, once or twice, I always thought it was kinda weird that, like, the
2479800	2483480	whole Comcast logo was in the corner, I'm like, it knows.
2483480	2484480	It's aware.
2484480	2487620	I mean, I know it's just reading my IP, and so it can tell, and, you know, probably the
2487620	2491960	gateway I'm going through and what have you, but it always kinda struck me as interesting.
2491960	2492960	I don't know.
2492960	2496640	I don't know if I wanna open this can of worms and make me sound even more ignorant, but
2496640	2497640	whatever.
2497640	2499000	I've gotta ask this question.
2499000	2505320	Is the reason how Time Warner and all these companies are able to block this because of
2505320	2512720	the fact that net neutrality didn't actually work out or was, like, they found that it's
2512720	2519280	not in the courts or whatever, that it's not actually exist, that net neutrality shouldn't
2519280	2520280	exist?
2520280	2524880	Well, how can Time Warner block this when it's on the internet?
2524880	2525880	You know what I mean?
2525880	2531200	It's just, it's just like how, you know, they go in the squabbles with, you know, um, like
2531200	2536800	Fox or whatever, all of a sudden blacked out on a certain cable provider because they don't
2536800	2541400	wanna pay certain royalties or whatever, so it may have been that these, like, Time Warner
2541400	2548880	Bright House didn't wanna, you know, pay ESPN or whatever, or something to that effect,
2548880	2549880	I'm thinking.
2549880	2554400	That's right, but that's also not the internet, that's TV, so I was always, it always kind
2554400	2555400	of fascinated me.
2555400	2559120	But it's TV content, though, I don't know how that exactly works with, like, streaming
2559120	2562640	on the web and stuff like that, and if you can get to it, because I know, like, some
2562640	2569960	places you can't, um, you can't stream, like, certain games on, um, the web, you know, depending
2569960	2573840	on your location or something like that, because of blackouts and...
2573840	2577520	If you're a Time Warner user, would you be able to get around this just by spoofing your
2577520	2578520	IP?
2578520	2579920	Maybe?
2579920	2582200	I'm not sure.
2582200	2585880	I bet there's websites out of there with more devious information than things I've read.
2585880	2589360	But you know what, I'm not really gonna pay attention to this whole streaming app until
2589360	2596760	they have ESPN 8, the Ocho, with all sorts of extreme sports and dodgeball.
2596760	2600640	Now, actually, I did try to watch, remember when dodgeball came out and stuff, and then
2600640	2604600	shortly after that they actually did have dodgeball on, like, one of the ESPNs or Spike
2604600	2605600	or something like that?
2605600	2606600	That's right, they did, they did.
2606600	2607600	It was boring.
2607600	2610720	It goes to show you, it's just a movie.
2610720	2612800	It's not exciting in real life.
2612800	2617360	But it's an awesome 8-bit NES video game, just so you know.
2617360	2618360	That's true.
2618360	2620400	And a Game Boy Advance launch title.
2620400	2624160	It's just like if someone, you know, if for whatever reason they decide, hey, you know
2624160	2628360	what, it'd be awesome if we have some people running around in an arena throwing Frisbees
2628360	2633680	with little lights on the outside of them and playing tag, you know, um, kind of like
2633680	2639280	Tron, but, you know, Disc Wars and stuff like that, that would not be fun to watch more
2639280	2640280	than once.
2640280	2644960	Uh, Jvmon in our chat room asks, but Sky, why would you go out of your way to do that
2644960	2646500	for ESPN?
2646500	2650600	If you're that into ESPN, you probably already have all their channels.
2650600	2657120	True, but I'm going by that hacker mentality of, because I can, and I'm not gonna be told
2657120	2658120	no.
2658120	2665360	I mean, isn't that kind of why people install Linux on toasters, because they can, you know?
2665360	2668160	And you can't is not a suitable answer.
2668160	2674840	I consider that as, I'm a power user, so, you know, if I want Linux to be on my toast,
2674840	2680160	then that'd be kind of cool to put Linux on a toaster and then have it print stuff on
2680160	2682640	your toast, if that were possible.
2682640	2684600	They make a coffee printer.
2684600	2685600	Coffee printer?
2685600	2686600	That?
2686600	2687600	Oh, that does, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
2687600	2693000	Uh, Derek H. in our chat room tries to clarify, kind of cheating though, Derek H. in our chat
2693000	2695600	room tries to clarify and break things down for me a little bit.
2695600	2699760	ESPN3 is a paid service that the ISP has to buy.
2699760	2704840	So spoofing your IP won't matter because the content can't get through the Time Warner
2704840	2705840	routers.
2705840	2706840	That's still disappointing.
2706840	2710800	I mean, I kind of thought once content was on the internet, everybody was supposed to
2710800	2711800	get it.
2711800	2712800	I mean, I, I get it now.
2712800	2716080	I get the reasons why it doesn't work, but it sucks.
2716080	2723360	Anyhow, uh, JV Mon also, I'm sorry, Rama in our chat room says, Sky getting into ESPN,
2723360	2724720	he loses 20 gay points.
2724720	2728400	Hey, hey, hey, hey, there's lots of gay guys that are into sports.
2728400	2732280	In fact, I'm actually taking, one of my best friends, I'm taking to this game with me because
2732280	2736880	he likes sports a lot and he likes basketballs and he happens to be to gay.
2736880	2738400	So there you go.
2738400	2740360	Anyhow, let's move on.
2740360	2742520	More news going on.
2742520	2748000	PlayStation app on the iPhone, not here yet, but here's the deal.
2748000	2751200	A PlayStation app has been announced for phones.
2751200	2755800	It's Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is releasing this, the official PlayStation app
2755800	2756800	in Europe.
2756800	2760640	Uh, you're going to be doing some PlayStation network interaction through your iPhone or
2760640	2761640	Android device.
2761640	2767240	Let me think, could that be buying games and spending money and my points through the phone?
2767240	2768920	That's gotta be one of it, right?
2768920	2773720	Yeah, you're not going to be playing games on this, but you can look at trophies and
2773720	2777640	you can look and see if your friends are on or offline or what have you, and you can also
2777640	2781240	see the official blog, at least in Europe, because this is being released as a Europe
2781240	2782240	product.
2782240	2788240	It is coming out soon in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands.
2788240	2792200	There are more countries set to be added to that list, but no word if the US is one of
2792200	2793440	them, but I would think so.
2793440	2795120	I mean, how could it not be?
2795120	2796120	One would hope so.
2796120	2797120	I would certainly think so.
2797120	2799840	And again, we are sort of the redheaded stepchild of the world.
2799840	2804880	Well it is, it is interesting that with all these rumors we've had lately of the Sony
2804880	2809960	phone and the photos of it in action and all that, that they are acknowledging at least
2809960	2814240	that, you know, the iPhone still has a huge ass market share, so they ought to put something
2814240	2815240	official on it.
2815240	2819500	No, they need to stop wasting their time with this crap and actually deliver on the stuff
2819500	2823560	that they promised us way back in the day before all this stuff was coming out.
2823560	2828280	Like for example, we would have trophy rooms in home where we can show off our trophies
2828280	2831360	and they would be really cool interactive things and people could walk through and do
2831360	2832360	that.
2832360	2834600	It's still not there.
2834600	2836660	What the hell?
2836660	2837660	Come on.
2837660	2842000	Do what you promised and stop wasting the damn time.
2842000	2843000	Loki's a little bitter.
2843000	2844000	I know a little bit.
2844000	2845000	No, not that it matters.
2845000	2848200	I would never go in the home again anyways because it's a waste of time.
2848200	2850640	I'll bag on Apple for a little bit for a minute though.
2850640	2851640	There is so much.
2851640	2857000	That's why Game Center sucks because there's so much trash out there in the app store,
2857000	2858920	especially stuff that is free.
2858920	2863560	Like I kid you not, I downloaded a free app the other day and the game itself is all right,
2863560	2868680	but if you want to unlock, here's how you get quote unquote achievements in Game Center.
2868680	2874200	You can get 50 points of achievements for emailing a friend about the game.
2874200	2881240	You can get another like 75 points for posting to your Facebook wall about the game and like
2881240	2885960	all these things that have nothing to do with actually playing the game itself and I just
2885960	2889440	think there needs to be some type of quality control.
2889440	2893440	Like I feel like Microsoft's put a little bit more quality control in achievements.
2893440	2897520	Granted there's some pretty asinine achievements out there too and some of them have to do
2897520	2900120	with, you know, download content and things like that, but I don't know.
2900120	2904760	I just look at Game Center and I go, sometimes leaving this stuff wide open is a little too
2904760	2908680	open, but maybe that's just me.
2908680	2912560	Sometimes I just go lolz.
2912560	2917160	Going back to ESPN3 for a little bit because I find this conversation in our chatroom humorous
2917160	2922560	at chat.orangelaungerated.com, Derek H says, oh my God, I'm checking out ESPN3 right now.
2922560	2927320	World badminton championships, enough said, but I like Brakeman's follow up.
2927320	2929840	They could have at least called it the shuttlecock tournament.
2929840	2930840	Nice.
2930840	2932920	There you go.
2932920	2935400	Chat.orangelaungerated.com if you want to chat with these folks.
2935400	2936400	Shuttlecock.
2936400	2937400	I know, right?
2937400	2941280	Well how about something that has nothing to do with cocks?
2941280	2942280	Boring.
2942280	2943280	Alright, no, we can do it.
2943280	2949160	Well, there's been a call to ban Mafia 2 by the daughter of a Sicilian journalist who
2949160	2951200	was murdered by the Mafia.
2951200	2954160	Well, the journalist was murdered, of course not she was.
2954160	2956360	Her name is Sonia Alfano.
2956360	2960680	She is a member of the European Parliament and President of Italy's Association for the
2960680	2967080	Family of Mafia Victims and I think she's, basically she's still grieving.
2967080	2969400	You know, it happened in 93.
2969400	2974680	Her father, Bepe, was murdered in January in 93.
2974680	2979480	She's saying that basically it's taking the Mafia from, you know, killing and death into
2979480	2982360	fun times.
2982360	2983960	And 2K, I'm sorry, Take Two.
2983960	2986360	It's that whole glamorizing violence thing.
2986360	2987760	Yeah, that's it.
2987760	2991640	And she's trying to get the European Commission to consider banning it.
2991640	2995040	Take Two is like, uh, no.
2995040	2997760	Basically it's dealing with the American Mafia.
2997760	3001240	You know, sort of like the Godfather and Sopranos, that type of thing.
3001240	3004520	And then they, you know, we're, you know, trying to make it sort of a more realistic
3004520	3009320	type thing yet still be entertaining, not necessarily to glorify the violence in real
3009320	3018160	life things, but to take the sort of, uh, fictional world of it.
3018160	3020760	To take the fictional world of it, not necessarily glamorize it.
3020760	3024000	Well, I, I, here's the funny thing.
3024000	3027840	I do, obviously, I think this is a little bit too much.
3027840	3032160	You don't ban an entire video game just because something unfortunate happened.
3032160	3035160	And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to disrespect what happened.
3035160	3038800	That's terrible that, you know, she lost her father in a crime like that so many years
3038800	3039800	ago.
3039800	3044320	I imagine that's something that you never get over, even though it's like 17 years later.
3044320	3048700	However, it's letting one bad apple ruin the barrel, so to speak.
3048700	3053640	At the same time, though, Take Two's argument of, well, it's not the European Mafia.
3053640	3055240	It's the American Mafia.
3055240	3059960	Okay, that's, that's, I don't think that's specifically their argument, just that they're
3059960	3064400	saying that it set, you know, the whole Godfather Sopranos slash kind of thing.
3064400	3068520	I, but I seriously don't think that makes it any better for this woman.
3068520	3073120	However, if somebody's going to do something stupid, they're going to do something stupid.
3073120	3076160	They don't need a video game to teach them how to do it.
3076160	3077160	It's funny.
3077160	3080320	I don't know why I'm reminded of this completely random conversation I was having last night
3080320	3085560	on the train, but Alan and I took BART into the city to go to the Metronon to see Tron,
3085560	3086560	right?
3086560	3089780	And while we were going down into the BART tunnel, I was commenting, wow, I have, I have
3089780	3091280	3G signal in here.
3091280	3093880	I haven't had 3G signal in BART tunnel.
3093880	3094880	I don't remember when.
3094880	3095880	They must have put a tower down here, right?
3095880	3099840	And he said, yeah, I think, I think they put a cell tower down in the BART stations a couple
3099840	3100840	of years ago.
3100840	3103880	You know, so people could still use their phone when they're down here.
3103880	3106280	But it met with a lot of resistance for a while.
3106280	3107280	They didn't want to put it in.
3107280	3109400	I was like, oh, is that just San Francisco being hippies again?
3109400	3110960	They don't want more cell towers.
3110960	3116240	No, apparently it had to do with the fact that when the UK bombings happened back in
3116240	3122760	oh, four, oh, five, sorry if I'm misstating that, but back when those happened, when those
3122760	3128960	buses went off, that was all triggered via Internet and Wi-Fi or what have you, wireless
3128960	3129960	signals.
3129960	3133200	And so they didn't want something similar happening in the San Francisco BART tunnels.
3133200	3135320	But I said, well, wait a minute.
3135320	3137400	You know, obviously, you know, we're not arguing.
3137400	3139360	He's just telling me the fact of the matter.
3139360	3144620	But my response is, wait a minute, like, if somebody is going to do something stupid,
3144620	3148840	they don't need 3G signal in order to be able to do it or not.
3148840	3153440	Well, this is my thing, too, you know, like, my granddaddy died of cancer.
3153440	3157320	I don't have a problem with house.
3157320	3159320	Must be lupus.
3159320	3160560	That's the only house joke I know.
3160560	3163360	I don't even watch the show, but I know there's a joke about lupus.
3163360	3168480	But they also, I've just picked something hospital related, so.
3168480	3169480	Right.
3169480	3171680	I don't have problems, okay.
3171680	3176320	I don't have problems with people that smoke other than that they usually stink.
3176320	3179760	But that's how my granddaddy got cancer.
3179760	3184400	Here's the other thing I think this gal needs to take into consideration is that, you know,
3184400	3189000	if she's upset about this Mafia video game, is she upset at the movie that comes out once
3189000	3195760	every three months, at least, that also glamorizes the Mafia and the crime and all that stuff
3195760	3198440	because there's an awful lot of movies.
3198440	3199440	What about books?
3199440	3202360	There's a lot of books.
3202360	3203360	The Godfather was a book.
3203360	3206240	Honestly, I think she's sensitive.
3206240	3207240	She has a right to be sensitive.
3207240	3213520	I understand she's sensitive, but at the same time, you don't take that out on everybody
3213520	3214520	else.
3214520	3215520	Yeah.
3215520	3221000	You don't ban a game from an entire country because you have that whole response to it.
3221000	3225640	I think that it's people taking their personal, you know, honestly, this goes back to one
3225640	3228640	of the biggest things that I think is wrong with the world in general.
3228640	3236040	It goes back to that, it's very selfish, I think, you know, and I'm not trying to belittle
3236040	3237040	her grief.
3237040	3238040	Exactly.
3238040	3245000	But it's like, you know, especially with the whole political correctness thing, you know.
3245000	3249800	People spend so many times because one or two people are offended for something, but
3249800	3252520	not the entire population.
3252520	3253520	You know?
3253520	3259360	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeonshreddy.com, Frisbee says, remember, 3G and Wi-Fi didn't
3259360	3261920	cause those buses to explode, explosives did.
3261920	3264440	Yeah, that was kind of my point, too.
3264440	3269560	Jvmon in our chatroom says, does that mean Facebook will be taking off Mafia wars?
3269560	3274040	William Murderface says, is she mad at Jersey Shore for making Italians look like asses?
3274040	3278160	That's a whole nother topic.
3278160	3282280	This is my thing, okay, for example, and I actually get a lot of this living in California,
3282280	3284720	I'm trying to pick something neutral and something light.
3284720	3290000	I get the whole, oh, Alabama's full of rednecks thing, which I know for a fact it's not.
3290000	3291000	I'm from there.
3291000	3293000	Am I a redneck?
3293000	3294000	Well.
3294000	3295000	Rob.
3295000	3296120	You do get awfully excited over Chick-fil-A.
3296120	3297120	Oh, God.
3297120	3301080	Well, Chick-fil-A's delicious, but I mean.
3301080	3302080	I'm kidding, by the way.
3302080	3303080	I know.
3303080	3304080	I just wrote three emails down.
3304080	3305080	It's fine.
3305080	3312180	But I mean, you know, a lot of people in the South are uber conservative, bush-loving,
3312180	3315200	you know, gun-toting rednecks.
3315200	3320200	I mean, the stereotypes exist for a reason.
3320200	3324320	However, I don't get offended because I know they're not talking about me.
3324320	3330060	Now, if they said all people from Alabama are freakin' rednecks and all that, I'd be
3330060	3331060	like, you know what?
3331060	3332060	That's not true.
3332060	3338360	allow me to educate you but you know weren't you raised by lesbians who live
3338360	3343820	in Alabama yes not your mother but you know your your pseudo mothers for a
3343820	3346940	couple years when you were out of high school right yes I was so and you know
3346940	3350060	when I think of Alabama I don't think of that's the place where all the lesbians
3350060	3358420	go I think of Santa Cruz but I'm saying that people and I understand the
3358420	3362740	concept behind wanting to make things better for other people wanting to try
3362740	3368340	to decrease opportunity for hate if that makes sense Rob mm-hmm but at the same
3368340	3375180	time I think that people are a little too sensitive I really like this comment
3375180	3378020	and I think this is a good one to end it on and move on to another story break
3378020	3381980	man in our chat room says people have the right to their opinions but they
3381980	3386780	don't have the right to enforce their opinions on others well said that's it
3386780	3390500	chat I think the world just needs to be a little thicker skinned chat orange
3390500	3393500	lounge radio.com or you can always email us if you have an opinion on that mail
3393500	3397580	bag at orange lounge radio.com I'd actually be really curious about this
3397580	3401700	and and this might be a dangerous place to go but that's okay we'll be a little
3401700	3407300	bit dangerous here on olr I kind of want to know if there's a game out there that
3407300	3413900	has ever made someone like that has ever kind of offended someone in this similar
3413900	3416540	type of manner and I'm not necessarily like I don't I don't want to hear you're
3416540	3419900	really like you know upsetting story about something that happened in the
3419900	3422260	family or whatever but is there have been something in a video game where you
3422260	3426220	were just kind of like you know what they really shouldn't have done that I'm
3426220	3429500	just kind of curious if people can think of a case like that and email it to us
3429500	3433140	mailbag at orange lounge radio.com there's a world war two games and you're out there killing Nazis
3433140	3438220	mm-hmm and yeah everything they did was really crappy but that's the past we
3438220	3444140	learned from it mm-hmm we move forward mm-hmm you know and I mean I'm saying
3444140	3447180	that now we should you know know what the warning signs are know what to stop
3447180	3452460	you know there should be no legislation that forces you know one you know person
3452460	3456860	you know it's something different when it's a something that's beyond your
3456860	3462220	control you know now that now that we can learn from history I think that
3462220	3465380	that's one thing but I think that people do need to understand that there's just
3465380	3470940	assholes in the world and people are haters gonna hate right exactly it's my
3470940	3474900	favorite just gotta just gotta be a little bit better than them but you know
3474900	3478220	ready to put the stop when it actually is something that you can do something
3478220	3484260	about you can't change minds you can't change the way people feel but you can
3484260	3490420	change how you respond to it all right it's some kind of a comment here along
3490420	3494160	those lines from Derek H in our chat room says I did not like the airport
3494160	3497160	scene in Call of Duty 4 at all I thought it was really fucked up and had no
3497160	3502260	reason being there chat dot orange roger dot com or a mailbag may I was really
3502260	3508660	offended one rockstar games decided hey you know what for the Ballad of Gay

3518260	3525860	iPod um close-knit deathmatch locations and not the big old expansive open-world
3525860	3530300	stuff that was very offensive to me I'm not sure we're on the same page Loki

3639780	3645340	Nobunaga I know they have Nobunaga's like they turn Nobunaga's ambition into
3645340	3649540	like an online game now so I'm not sure if this is the online game itself I
3649540	3652920	thought that had already come out or if this is like the first expansion but
3652920	3656780	that is coming out in Japan on the 22nd unfortunately the description is in

3759300	3764700	anything but we do get to saga three she could know Hasha shadow or light comes

3770260	3775100	it's a remake of one of the saga games which was what Final Fantasy legend here
3775100	3781780	so that's kind of cool lastly going to the PSP beyond the Milky Way comes out

3790140	3794260	parasite Eve game coming on PSP the third birthday this week so there'll be
3794260	3797460	a lot of folks importing that one that's probably the biggest release of them all
3797460	3804460	over to the UK Dark Sakura well as for our UK news we have a bare few things
3804460	3809700	not like the bare necessities or anything on the 21st we have the
3809700	3817620	battlefield bad company to Vietnam 22nd back to the future on the 29th rascals
3817620	3824500	and also on the 34 I'll go ahead mention the 31st we have EA Sports Grand Slam
3824500	3831180	tennis because kids like tennis and that's it all right that's gonna do it
3831180	3834180	for the release dates this week let's go back into some news and we have the
3834180	3837540	classic game of the week just a few minutes ahead of us but first a story
3837540	3845620	from Loki yes let's see this is kind of neat now you may remember that they just
3845620	3853660	released the pretty awesome infinity blade on the iPhone and iOS App Store
3853660	3857780	well there's gonna be other games supporting the unreal development kit
3857780	3865220	and it's kind of cool one of the demos that they're showing off the unreal
3865220	3871300	development kit for was none other than the long hopefully not forgotten epic
3871300	3879980	game just jackrabbit but now updated in 3d graphics and fun stuff like that
3879980	3886460	there's actually some other epic whatever unreal engine games that are
3886460	3889660	coming to the store in fact I think there's actually one and I don't
3889660	3894180	remember what it was called but it was I kind of looked a little bit like World
3894180	3899620	of Warcraft on but it was like a tower defense game or something like that
3899620	3903620	we're like a hack and slash game with the name dungeon in the title I don't
3903620	3911020	remember exactly what it was but it looked pretty cool so but yeah I mean
3911020	3917020	more games supporting the unreal engine would be pretty awesome because they can
3917020	3921740	do some pretty sweet looking stuff just even up with the limited resources of
3921740	3927500	the iOS and the iPhones and stuff like that just like when I hear that there
3927500	3931260	might be a new jazz jackrabbit or whatever I'm like oh my god is it 1994
3931260	3938260	this is great yeah that's awesome something else that is new and exciting
3938260	3942500	I guess depends what kind of games you play sing star yeah I remember seeing
3942500	3947700	star the karaoke games it's also a dance game I played your Abba yeah sing star
3947700	3951100	you shouldn't tell everybody on the internet I have that but I told oh come
3951100	3956100	on you said that was your reason for getting a ps3 it was I need to get sing
3956100	3960340	star Queen but here's some other exciting stuff about sing star the sing
3960340	3965020	star store is set to explode if you live in the u.s. here's the thing sing star is
3965020	3969260	actually really big in Europe it's much bigger in Europe than it is here and
3969260	3972220	there's lots and lots of downloadable songs that go to Europe but they don't
3972220	3976540	come over to the u.s. but here's the deal there's been a new deal made between
3976540	3982420	Sony and Universal Music meaning that the content that goes to Europe will now
3982420	3988700	be coming to the u.s. as well and it all started this week 64 new songs hit the
3988700	3993860	u.s. sing star store 11 of them tracks for seeing star dance these tracks cost
3993860	3997780	about a buck 50 each I'm trying to see if there's any like really really big
3997780	4001500	songs and here there's a shit ton of Lady Gaga songs so if you're into Lady
4001500	4004820	Gaga there's quite a few songs from her first album that are there and bad
4004820	4008580	romance because you know you want to make your friend sing bad romance songs
4008580	4015780	from the Jackson 5 are now there take that that's that's a old-school band
4015780	4019580	that I think is getting back together just like did you know that the new kids
4019580	4022980	on the block and the Backstreet Boys are going out on tour together yes and I
4022980	4026380	actually did see that performance speaking of it being the 90s all over
4026380	4034060	again somebody asked me if I wanted to go I'm like no I don't know like no I'm
4034060	4042540	not no but you can do some dancing to Tiffany I think we're alone now and aha
4042540	4045420	take on me I'm sorry I still like the birthday massacre version better
4045420	4050240	whatever there it is some sing star stuff for you hey let's go to the
4050240	4056380	classics video games and talk about an old-school game the dark soccer thinks
4056380	4061020	hey you kids ought to be playing this week the classic video game of the week
4061020	4066140	dark soccer is gonna step into the vault find a game that she says hey you got
4066140	4071380	two weeks cuz the holiday play this game damn it what's classic game of the week
4071380	4075980	I can tell you people are gonna have a hard time finding this one space fantasy
4075980	4083060	zone space fantasy zone yes not fantasy zone but space fantasy zone basically
4083060	4090980	what this game is is that it is a mix of space Harrier and fantasy zone and even
4090980	4098140	the music is a little remix of the things it actually with with the
4098140	4103140	particular game it never came out it was never released this is a prototype oh
4103140	4112900	wait a minute however however um you actually can find the the disk image
4112900	4117980	online aha so the kiddies are gonna have to resort to more scandalous means to
4117980	4121340	play this game I wouldn't necessarily say it's scandalous given that you know
4121340	4129700	I don't really think there's any kind of restriction on it but it is really
4129700	4135100	pretty it's still got the same kind of space Harrier scaling issues it's pretty
4135100	4140020	minimalist but the other thing that actually I didn't really care for it too
4140020	4144220	is that it is a little bit harder to hit stuff but it's still so freaking cute I
4144220	4148140	mean because the game space Harrier is set in the fantasy zone you know welcome
4148140	4152300	to fancy zone get ready so it takes two of the best things and just puts them
4152300	4157700	together and you know your bosses are your you know some of your classic
4157700	4167260	fantasy zone bosses it's just really neat and it's cute it really is just
4167260	4172060	it's something for people who love space Harrier or fantasy zone I mean that was
4172060	4177420	really all that it is it's it's eye candy oh and you can go into your
4177420	4183700	little shops and buy stuff you've got the same you know lady from your from
4183700	4188700	the shops and fantasy zone and get all kinds of goodies it's just cute I mean
4188700	4193700	that's really all I can say about it and it's got the oppa oppa and his little
4193700	4199700	feet sticking out going that's really it that's really all I can say about it
4199700	4203540	this is a prototype it never really came out that's alright it's especially it's
4203540	4208420	a special game for the holidays exactly and like I said you can you can find it
4208420	4215740	online you know if you've got a week we've played it I mean I'm gonna link
4215740	4218000	people here in the chat room to the little youtubes they can kind of see
4218000	4221340	what this game looks like because it is key I mean it's exactly what you said
4221340	4225020	it's space Harrier with fantasy zone graphics it's pretty cute and I figured
4225020	4228420	since fantasy zone is my second favorite game is space Harrier is my third
4228420	4233460	favorite game I have to throw the two together but you know oddly enough I
4233460	4238020	wouldn't exactly I don't really classify space fantasy zone on so let's see the
4238020	4241900	other reason why I'm ringing it up for the classic game is that it is you can
4241900	4247980	play the whole thing it's fun it's it's you know a nice waste of time not there
4247980	4251940	usually are a few issues with the disc 2 and burning so you have to be really
4251940	4257060	careful when you do it but it's like see there's the wood face thing yeah I like
4257060	4261660	how the bosses in this game kind of look like the bosses from the original
4261660	4264900	fantasy they are the bosses yeah you know what I mean though they're in that
4264900	4270140	whole 3d environment so kind of neat so I really had to had to just throw it out
4270140	4275820	there you know it's a game that I think any fan of fantasy zone and space
4275820	4280780	Harrier should at least give a look at now there's some listeners that aren't
4280780	4283860	gonna know so I have to ask you just said your second favorite game ever is
4283860	4287540	fantasy zone and your third favorite ever is space Harrier what's number one
4287540	4292420	that would be the Guardian legend amen sister the Guardian legend most
4292420	4297460	underrated NES game ever the game is so great great absolutely astounding it's
4297460	4300540	not as good any of those games as Super Metroid but they're all still really
4300540	4306300	good well that's your favorite game I know but I mean so really I know it's
4306300	4310740	not an official released game and yeah I've got a few prototypes of other stuff
4310740	4316260	but this is one prototype that you can get the full version of out there it's
4316260	4321060	not unavailable mm-hmm you know now you can't find an official printing of it or
4321060	4324900	something without spending the bucks right but still and you know there's no
4324900	4327620	I don't think there's any real reason about why it wasn't released it might
4327620	4333580	have been something about licensing issues mm-hmm but it's just fun and I
4333580	4338620	mean it's not even really the greatest game ever but it is something that uh
4338620	4343020	that's worth playing it's something that's worth checking out and at least
4343020	4350500	you know watch the video it's cute all right and I I still love the PC engine
4350500	4354760	well that's gonna do it for part a here at orange lounge radio but don't go

4548860	4553940	marquee speaking of World of Warcraft I guess I should take this opportunity to

4726060	4731660	get into some rapid-fire news some quick news stories that we just don't have the
4731660	4734540	full time to talk about we want to bring him to your attention on the last lucky
4734540	4741460	yes so this is neat super meat boy game we've actually been talking about on the
4741460	4745700	show for a few weeks now and is very awesome if you happen to have the PC
4745700	4751500	version apparently they figured out a way to uncover the dev mode located in
4751500	4757500	the game and of course it was discovered by the modding community and I believe
4757500	4764100	it allows you to customize your game a little bit of course this is only in the
4764100	4768980	PC version it gives you the keys to the kingdom as they put it and some very
4768980	4774380	user-friendly tools in which a team meet created the game with including the
4774380	4780380	original batch of levels and actually is kinda cool team meet the creators of the
4780380	4784100	game are actually nice enough to post a few tutorial videos explaining how to
4784100	4789780	access and use the tools until the you know finally get around to making a
4789780	4795100	proper level creator but that's pretty awesome that you know someone figured
4795100	4799060	out where the dev mode is and they went ahead and decided hey you know what we're
4799060	4802420	just gonna go ahead and instead of saying no why did you do that we're
4802420	4806940	gonna help people out and see how people get creative with it so that's really
4806940	4811660	sweet and of course if you're a fan of dead rising to you'll be happy to know
4811660	4817780	that on December 27th dead rising to case west will be coming out on xbox
4817780	4825820	live arcade it's the exclusive epilogue to the game and will cost you a hundred
4825820	4831540	microsoft points or ten dollars do want so that looks pretty awesome and of
4831540	4834820	course they're also going to have you know the photo part of the game coming
4834820	4842940	back as well for that is so nice little after Christmas gift there and then
4842940	4846980	finally section 8 which was a first-person shooter came out last
4846980	4855260	August or I should say August 09 that actually did ok retail and was a full
4855260	4860380	price game when it came out but now for the sequel prejudice they've decided hey
4860380	4864060	instead of you know charging $60 for a game we're just gonna actually put it
4864060	4869820	out on xbox live arcade in the PlayStation Network as well as PC for
4869820	4874580	only $15 so that's pretty awesome that they went ahead and they're gonna put
4874580	4879700	out full game for the $15 and it's gonna also include a single-player campaign
4879700	4884900	support for up to 32 players and online multiplayer and a new four-player co-op
4884900	4889380	mode called swarm says offline players will also be able to partake in
4889380	4897380	multiplayer as the game can add bots in case you don't have your friends or
4897380	4900380	internet connection to play against
4901220	4908340	cool and what they're saying I think the way they're going to come about making
4908340	4911100	up some of the money they would have made from a retail version is they're
4911100	4915540	gonna have this substantial download content so that's pretty substantial
4915540	4920220	download content as opposed to like just a little bit yes
4920220	4925820	alright this is a very interesting game coming to the iPad iPhone and the
4925820	4931900	Macintosh it's called Hamlet the game yes that's right and Hamlet's taking out
4931900	4937860	the trash only it's not really is that Hamlet 2 no that was from last action
4937860	4944220	hero oh I should be or not to be I've got to be have you seen Hamlet 2 no it's
4944220	4949300	the dumbest fucking movie is there still kids here I'm hoping not as the doors
4949300	4953240	wide open is there still kids here I don't think so okay good it's the
4953240	4958300	dumbest fucking movie ever made but it's it's like so dumb it's kind of funny so
4958300	4962220	anyway I was able to but this actually is not really what you would think it
4962220	4964780	is in fact there's a whole little trailer out there for the game and I
4964780	4969180	kind of like it's very like stylized I like that style it's a kind of like that
4969180	4976460	limbo esque thing going on there yeah it's all coming out January 2011 I'm
4976460	4981460	playing the trailer here in studio it's an adventure game this does not look
4981460	4989580	like Hamlet to play to me but it is based on Shakespeare's Hamlet so I have
4989580	4995940	no idea how that works see now we need the disaster gay friend to show up what
4995940	5000940	you're doing what what are you doing I know right apparently the rest of the
5000940	5007940	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 roster has been revealed it's spoiled that is if you
5007940	5013940	believe the dirty internet rumors Cienko from Darkstalkers sweet Akuma from
5013940	5018820	Street Fighter Haggar from Final Fight really yes that's awesome actually
5018820	5027500	Phoenix the x-men sentinel from the x-men taskmaster Avengers ish Galactus
5027500	5033500	is the final boss in the fight fantastic for taskmasters be interesting so there
5033500	5036700	you go apparently some other characters that were planned for the game but they
5036700	5042900	didn't make it Phoenix Wright Megaman venom and Frank West were all planned
5042900	5047660	for the game but it just didn't happen I'm kind of sad that Frank West won't
5047660	5050180	show up that's kind of surprising but then again he's not the central
5050180	5054500	character in the new game so I don't know it would have been an easy port
5054500	5058500	since I you know totsunoko vs. Capcom had him but you would think right
5058500	5067300	taskmaster taskmaster actually makes sense because he was a regular in a dead
5067300	5074740	in the old older Deadpool comic for a while right well hey if you like RPGs and
5074740	5080260	you own a PSP and you like when I say RPGs I mean like old-school RPGs then
5080260	5084580	like seriously like there is an awesome incredible must-have game that was
5084580	5088140	announced for the PSP this week it's going to be so awesome I can't wait like
5088140	5091460	like get the dust off the PSP break them out
5091460	5098020	Squeenix has announced that they are bringing Final Fantasy 4 to the PSP and
5098020	5104580	this is not the 3d version that was on the DS but it's being redone in 2d
5104580	5111100	with the graphics in HD allah the Final Fantasy 1 & 2 remakes but here's the
5111100	5117460	thing it's not just Final Fantasy 4 it's also the after years on one disc that
5117460	5121900	was the mobile game that came out on we wear and that is also being upgraded to
5121900	5126340	the new treatment so that is awesome Final Fantasy 4 complete collection for
5126340	5130380	the PSP was revealed by V jump magazine in Japan this week keep in mind this is
5130380	5135020	only officially been announced for Japan but I can't see how this game isn't
5135020	5139820	coming out over here I mean this just oh man this is just awesome so there it is
5139820	5144740	it's coming out in Japan this spring probably the u.s. and what summer next

5150540	5154660	find that one cover so I can show the chat room but how about something else
5154660	5160100	Final Fantasy related Rob sure Final Fantasy Tactics it's the war of on the
5160100	5163900	lions was supposed to come out on September 15th but then it got delayed
5163900	5171500	so dead they are giving it a release window spring 2011 for the iPhone and
5171500	5175940	put some pictures up on Facebook they were plugging that at e3 this year
5175940	5179820	after taking a while to get out I wonder what's going on with it but it looks
5179820	5183460	cute take the time to get it right don't really something buggy that's fine by me
5183460	5189580	agreed and also in this should make people pretty happy is that there's new
5189580	5195140	rock band download content for Christmas it actually is a happy Christmas war is

5255780	5260540	a dream cast collection GameStop has a listing for it supposedly out of
5260540	5267820	September September why I'm saying September February that sounds like a
5267820	5276380	holiday month FAP timber February 15th for $30 but there's really not a whole
5276380	5281380	lot saying just that there is something by the Sega marketing VP Alan Pritchard
5281380	5285180	says and this is a quote we actually have a dreamcast collection coming out
5285180	5295460	soon but how descriptive yeah that's a nothing PSO or GTFO right right but I'll
5295460	5301220	take Space Channel 5 Space Channel 5 I like how she's okay I like just how
5301220	5305340	completely emotionless she says it in the Japanese version whereas you got
5305340	5308940	Apollo smile who was the most annoying person in the universe being all
5308940	5311820	fabulous and everything in the u.s. one and then the Japanese only have Space
5311820	5318040	Channel 5 okay by the way I just had to point this out in our chat room at chat

5565660	5571300	topics if you want to send us a tweet twitter.com slash o-l-r moving on to some
5571300	5577500	other news Loki yes we were talking a little bit about the inclusion of the
5577500	5581580	unreal development kit for iOS well one of the first games to take advantage of
5581580	5588780	that was Infinity Blade and if any blade did pretty well with its launch it made
5588780	5594220	1.7 million dollars in four days and that's pretty good for being a six
5594220	5600300	dollar game they sold it over two hundred and eighty six thousand times and
5600300	5608340	it's the fastest-grossing app ever according to the website app moto wow
5608340	5614220	the old record I guess was held by cut the rope which was 1 million dollars in
5614220	5618180	10 days I didn't realize cut the rope had caught on so quickly I thought cut
5618180	5620180	the right I mean I've heard of cut the rope but I thought it was one of I've
5620180	5623980	never played it though but I thought it was one of those games that kind of
5623980	5628300	slowly grew and popular and actually I could stand to correct it apparently
5628300	5634460	epic Mark rain he said that the game center numbers are being reported are
5634460	5640980	quite a bit lower than the actual sales so more than 1.7 million hmm says the
5640980	5645300	says I tweeted because I thought that it'd be obvious that the game center
5645300	5649900	numbers are a subset of our overall sales and not the actual number but
5649900	5654260	several of the reports I saw seem to be confused about that also infinity blade
5654260	5659460	does not require game center you can choose to cancel and still play the game
5659460	5664380	however I recommend signing up for game center Apple has done a great job yeah
5664380	5668540	right I'm sorry that's where I lost him right there did you hear speaking of
5668540	5672460	like failed Apple launches did you hear ping got some new additions in the last
5672460	5676180	week remember paying huh well you know what ping is no whatever first off
5676180	5680140	whatever happened to pooping there was that website one of our listeners made
5680140	5687180	the pooping site but anyway no ping has now you can share playlists with your
5687180	5692380	friends you can share playlists of songs that you know you could go and then buy
5692380	5697300	on iTunes hey that's finally it's finally a feature of paying the Twitter
5697300	5702020	doesn't have however insignificant it may be
5702020	5708380	so you know other fun stuff infinity blades getting an update next week
5708380	5712940	they're gonna be adding some new enemies to face because I think from what I
5712940	5719180	heard there's only like six that you face each time play through the game and
5719180	5724300	they're also going to be adding multiplayer soon which is pretty
5724300	5731180	awesome and also five new weapons five new shields five new helmets a new armor
5731180	5736940	set enough equipment to increase the level cap to 45 and then of course the
5736940	5743540	new enemy type called the morrow fiend or marrow fiend and that's screenshots
5743540	5748500	from a frickin iPhone yes it is Alex outstanding I have not I will have to
5748500	5752140	show it to you you at some point we're not trying to do a radio show I'm in
5752140	5756740	later I know I know I know all right during our music break after the show
5756740	5764460	alright sounds good let's talk about sex now that I have your attention let's
5764460	5770180	talk about this new thing that's on the thingy it's on the connect yeah here's
5770180	5774380	the deal we were talking earlier about connect tax and you know you people can
5774380	5779540	play the piano and and people can do you know whatever these 3d dancing and all
5779540	5782380	these sorts of things that connect well it didn't take long for somebody to
5782380	5791100	think of sex and it's from tricks with three X's that's tricks tricks they have
5791100	5796820	built a connect based interface for a sex video game you slide your hands
5796820	5801660	across computer-generated tits and computer-generated ass that's really all
5801660	5805940	there is right now there's just a little floaty hand that is your hand that gets
5805940	5811980	to rub some fake boobies the Kinect hardware is used plus some of the open
5811980	5817420	drivers in Windows 7 is how it works and unfortunately I would play the video for
5817420	5821140	you but it was removed from YouTube because some people reported it for
5821140	5826500	nudity and sexual content boo ruining all our fun boo it's just like all the
5826500	5830700	other sex games that they have out there like all the anime ones stuff where you
5830700	5834060	use the mouse and stuff instead of using the mouse use your hand it's honestly
5834060	5839540	not that exciting people it is not it's it's pretty much exactly what we said
5839540	5845620	you rub this magical floaty hand over boobs and the chick goes you know boobs
5845620	5851420	anyway you might be wondering when this is coming out for the Xbox 360 really
5851420	5855860	you're really wondering that here's the thing Microsoft is pretty much said hell
5855860	5861420	no in an interview with IGN they said quote Xbox is a family-friendly games and
5861420	5865500	entertainment console and does not allow adults only content to be certified for
5865500	5869460	use on its platform and would not condone this type of game for Kinect hold
5869460	5876460	on hold on stop right there really IGN really you went and asked them like it
5876460	5880620	was a completely obvious to begin with that this was a first off never going to
5880620	5885020	come out on a console be it was just a PC game anyways and see it wasn't that
5885020	5889540	interesting of an idea but no you have the spare time to go ask them this so
5889540	5894660	you can get a comment so that you can get some more pages good job I agree but
5894660	5897820	at the same time maybe you should dedicate a podcast to that too because
5897820	5902860	they have like 80,000 podcast it's kind of bullshit because you know and I'm
5902860	5907540	probably preaching to the choir here but if somebody really wants to waste $60 on
5907540	5913340	this then you know what let them you know how is this any worse than some of
5913340	5916780	the bang-bang shoot-em-up games that are out there like I don't know mafia 2 that
5916780	5920780	was brought up earlier in the show all right I'm so double standard of sex
5920780	5923900	versus there is a double standard and I bet you anything this will come out in
5923900	5928660	Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 3 where they will have it where you can
5928660	5934140	tickle them with yes it's just tickling and it's just a giant feather that's in
5934140	5937220	your hand it's not actually your hand but it's a giant feather and you can go
5937220	5941900	tickle tickle tickle tickle and they'll go hee hee hee and their boobs will move yeah but that'll be okay
5941900	5946020	that'll be all right DarkSakura would you play Dead or Alive if it had a booby
5946020	5955100	tickling connect mode yes you should be able to unlock them I think that I think
5955100	5958340	that they should have the dudes in the game
5958340	5964580	ok this is the thing boobs are a lot more fun than junk like for bounciness
5964580	5974820	ok I'll with you on that so why don't they have one with dudes and speedos and
5974820	5979220	everything I'm surprised they don't have like a beach you know beach where mode
5979220	5984540	in like Dead or Alive you know wasn't there the whole volleyball game but I'm
5984540	5989820	talking about like actual fighting you know I don't know how I feel about this
5989820	5995380	chat dot orange laundry dot com longs got I don't know in our chat room says
5995380	6000220	poop should be cool in video games no I don't think that's ever really cool like
6000220	6004940	some things you know again if that's what somebody really wants to pay 60
6004940	6011940	bucks on his poop the game then you know what I mean you can poop for free like
6011940	6016340	every day just eat more fiber you know but tickling chicks with feathers that
6016340	6020740	one that's not every day unless you're a rockstar PC indie game where you had the
6020740	6042780	poop don't shit your pants anything is possible on the PC and that's what
6042780	6047860	that's why folks PC gaming will never cease to exist in you think that poop is
6047860	6052900	not in games yet or at least not enough in games just wait Duke Nukem forever
6052900	6058060	hasn't come out yet so I'm sure there'll be plenty of poop in that I love this
6058060	6062060	oh my god is the best constant comment ever and I can't pronounce this name
6062060	6069540	kassan khan khan with an s says too long so god about his old poop thing fiber
6069540	6077940	uppercut you win you win chatter of the evening right there sound the bells and
6077940	6084180	whistles be me me dude whose name I can't pronounce kassen kassen congrats
6084180	6095380	fiber uppercut you win alrighty hell only on orange launch radio maybe we
6095380	6098460	could get away from the sex topic for a minute here dark Sakura do you have
6098460	6102300	something maybe a little more legitimate for us shadow the hedgehog
6102300	6110660	barf barf barf barf serious yeah well basically Sega wanted to describe what
6110660	6115420	when it is talk about why we got shadow the hedgehog they thought it would work
6115420	6123380	for US gamers the producer of sonic colors Takashi Iizuka said after Sonic
6123380	6128380	adventure we had two studios when the US one in Japan and to continue the quote
6128380	6131780	Japanese studio was to develop a sonic game in the standard style in the US was
6131780	6134380	to develop something different which could contribute to the sonic franchise
6134380	6141180	so basically he was made to work in the US because first and third person
6141180	6144700	shooters were popular and they wanted someone who could work with it hence we
6144700	6151140	got you know shadow the gangsta hedgehog so but what they'd have to realize is
6151140	6158860	that we like sonic because it's not standard american fair file this under
6158860	6166900	the Americans are so stupid been more like don't try to estimate what a
6166900	6170340	completely different cultures going to like why is it that like every time
6170340	6175300	there's a game is like targeted at America it usually like really stinks I
6175300	6180540	don't know maybe I'm just doing an overall broad it was a cool character
6180540	6185460	really well-designed but other than that the concept was just crap it had
6185460	6190020	potential I mean it was you know signed a hedgehog guns I mean how do you make
6190020	6197780	things better yet guns to it or boobs you know or both but somehow they just
6197780	6201260	said you know what instead of making it run fast and stuff we're just gonna make
6201260	6209060	him have guns colors gonna be so much nicer I'm looking forward already I was
6209060	6213620	there but I can't afford it right now there is a game that was like targeted
6213620	6218540	for the u.s. or whatever that wasn't that bad secret of evermore was horribly
6218540	6222740	underrated like it actually was a good game yeah I had that I had the super
6222740	6225900	news I probably still have the Super Nintendo Kart in a bin somewhere but
6225900	6231300	yeah that was not as terrible as people made it out to me I mean it was no second
6231300	6235820	to set so three but it was good in its own way and wasn't that the first game
6235820	6239020	that what's his name the guy who does all the music for like Guild Wars and
6239020	6243380	oblivion Jeremy's soul so they he did that was like his first soundtrack I
6243380	6249300	think was secret evermore so I guess it's rare but it does happen occasionally
6249300	6261820	let's move on yes now I'm gonna try to report this without sounding hateful
6261820	6270980	try not very hard great use a low-key rants and I'm just saying graders both
6270980	6275780	eyes creator wants to add monthly updates that that's fine that that's
6275780	6283140	cool plans premium car upgrades later on stuff like that so basically they're
6283140	6287140	saying that they don't consider their work complete yet really you think that
6287140	6292380	game wasn't rushed to market because it's been you know in development for
6292380	6297940	years now and they really need to get it out this year because the lane again
6297940	6302820	people just kind of roll their eyes at them but you know there's only about
6302820	6307620	fifth of the vehicles that represent in the game right now with premium models
6307620	6311620	which feature higher resolution textures yes that's right some of the good models
6311620	6316260	in the game are quite as finished as others but don't worry they're going to
6316260	6324580	be adding patches later on to add some new items including new premium cars
6324580	6329100	available for download and they haven't said yet whether those updates will be
6329100	6335900	free great so you could pay or possibly pay more for more of your game that you
6335900	6340540	purchase that isn't quite done yet but don't worry they'll finish it someday
6340540	6348820	and they'll call it Gran Turismo 6 when do you think do you think Gran Turismo 6 is
6348820	6351020	going to come out for the ps3 or do you think we're gonna wait for the next
6351020	6356740	system next console yeah what about that whole 10-year life cycle thing we're
6356740	6360140	only what four years old don't worry Gran Turismo 6 prologue will be coming
6360140	6365020	out you know and it'll be totally like the game was I mean man that's guys well
6365020	6367940	I don't know if it's got a suck for the people that bought prologue I mean I
6367940	6372580	think that's a dumb idea to buy the game anyways the prologue cuz what's the
6372580	6378180	point nearly paying for a demo basically oh no no it's a full-featured game with
6378180	6384780	like new very few cars but all right well oh sorry and no it's on demo all
6384780	6388220	right coming also to the PlayStation 3 very soon and a lot of people are
6388220	6391820	excited about this even though this game was already out some time ago Mass
6391820	6394940	Effect 2 is coming out to the PlayStation 3 but there's some you know
6394940	6398540	some tweaks and some upgrades and some new things Mass Effect 3 of course is
6398540	6402460	coming out in 2011 but you of course have this whole weird thing going on
6402460	6407380	where Mass Effect 2 is coming out on the PlayStation 3 but Mass Effect 1 never
6407380	6412140	came out so if I don't own an Xbox how do I get that experience of Mass Effect
6412140	6416740	1 well they've figured it out there's an interactive comic that's gonna come with
6416740	6421820	Mass Effect 2 called Mass Effect Genesis and what it does is it kind of is a
6421820	6426500	really quick like play I don't say it's a playthrough because it's a comic but
6426500	6433020	it's a real quick summary I guess of the 360 and the PC game Mass Effect 1 but
6433020	6437820	you also get to actually do some things in this comic that you did in the
6437820	6442900	original game you get to make they're saying six decisions that you made in
6442900	6446860	Mass Effect 1 that will now impact your Mass Effect 2 game I hope one of those
6446860	6451140	decisions is making sweet sweet love to the alien chick yes it wasn't the whole
6451140	6455580	lesbian thing in Mass Effect 1 that that hopefully that is one decision but I'm
6455580	6458660	not gonna hold my breath but yeah apparently you will get to make some of
6458660	6462060	the decisions and have your game impacted just like you could play Mass
6462060	6466660	Effect 1 and have your game get impacted in Mass Effect 2 so that's kind of neat
6466660	6474820	so a PlayStation 3 gamer will get to start the game do the opening sequence
6474820	6477780	and then they're gonna go into this comic that I guess will then impact the
6477780	6484660	game later on so that's kind of cool I like that so that again that is coming
6484660	6489140	out in January Mass Effect 1 they are saying is not gonna come out for the
6489140	6492460	PlayStation 3 because they're gonna move on to Mass Effect 3 so this is as close
6492460	6495540	as you're ever gonna get unless you happen to own a PC which you probably do
6495540	6499620	if you're listening to show and you can go play Mass Effect 1 I don't know if
6499620	6506620	Mac has Mass Effect 1 if it is if it does it's probably on Steam there you go

6526500	6531620	everyone I have a question that can possibly that can possibly answered I
6531620	6537940	mean that should be be answered by the OLR gang and chat room I'm an avid
6537940	6541140	knitter and I'm looking for a video game character garments that look like they
6541140	6544580	were knitted the only two examples I can think of are Riku's scarf from Final
6544580	6551660	Fantasy 10 2 and Nora S. Theum sweater slash vest in Final Fantasy 13 pictures
6551660	6556100	attached I've got no problems no projects going on and I'm waiting to
6556100	6560240	start Nora's sweater slash vest as soon as I get patterns from someone to make
6560240	6563300	them up for me because I don't know anything about sewing and patterns
6563300	6567980	thanks so much Stan PS last time I wrote in I was telling you about how a friend
6567980	6571520	said I wasn't a gamer because I didn't like certain games well I confronted him
6571520	6574900	and we're cool now in fact the other friend was with us when I brought it up
6574900	6577740	and made them both listen to that episode of your show and now he's a fan
6577740	6582300	did I already share this I didn't know oh well I don't think so that's kind of
6582300	6585580	cool that's really awesome that we can like make fun of your friend and he's
6585580	6590720	still a fan of the show awesome I'm checking out this oh yeah yeah you're
6590720	6595740	into the whole knitting thing wouldn't I crochet Rob oh I always get the two
6595740	6602140	confused yeah knitting I think you can do more with knitting but I I don't have
6602140	6606160	the coordination for it now when it when I tried to learn again it really made my
6606160	6609620	hand hurt I mean crochet will do it to me after a while because I finished a
6609620	6612940	hat for Becky that was really yeah but you got that whole trigger finger thing
6612940	6616660	still don't you like you know residual stuff from when that was really
6616660	6620420	bothering you well I'm sure there's also characters that wear hats um yeah I
6620420	6623020	would think like a lot of like I don't know I for some reason I think of the
6623020	6627260	Zelda world I also think of a game you should look up as eternal Sonata like I
6627260	6630300	don't know if there was a lot but I don't know why I just think of that game
6630300	6633820	but something that could be like a creative idea like if you're really
6633820	6637180	looking for projects that you know I kind of see these things online once in
6637180	6640740	a while and I always thought they were kind of cool like look up 8-bit sprites
6640740	6645780	and there's a lot of websites around that have like 8-bit 8-bit right
6645780	6649900	repositories needle craft really cuz I was gonna say you could do I mean but
6649900	6653380	still it kind of gives you an idea like how to knit like if you want to make
6653380	6658140	like a blanket or some other type of throw or something I can't believe I'm
6658140	6662620	actually talking about knitting you can get some ideas for patterns from like
6662620	6666460	old-school 8-bit sprites I would think I mean not gonna get clothes patterns but
6666460	6672820	I have to sit and draw it but I did have a plan for a much later project of
6672820	6678700	crocheting a Tetris blanket oh that's fun I'd crochet it actually in the blocks
6678700	6686100	and then attach the box with yarn but I right now I don't have the time or
6686100	6689840	patience for it what about like a pillow front thing or is that more of a needle
6689840	6696420	point you could crochet a sham hmm but but as far as like actual clothing
6696420	6700260	gosh nothing really comes to mind for me I think the best place to go would be
6700260	6703620	RPGs and I don't know why but I'm thinking of the characters from eternal
6703620	6709180	sonata like I've seen one that had a lot of knitting type stuff I don't know I
6709180	6713980	don't know does Dan know the Dan do you know video game characters that wear
6713980	6720660	knitted outfits did he give you the face what he just gave me this face of shit
6720660	6730660	no no Rob I don't earthbound that's that's Ness's sweat oh my gosh knitting
6730660	6735220	advice from Dan Ness's sweater could very well be knitted what a wonderful
6735220	6741140	idea who would have thought this Freddy Krueger hey dude I'm on the street that
6741140	6747060	was a game all right dad goes that Dan goes a really bad game now did he send
6747060	6751260	pictures of his projects cuz I'm seeing pictures of the characters okay well we
6751260	6756300	need to see pictures of your work so we'll be awaiting those pictures that's
6756300	6761940	a really see I think in a lot of games don't have that level of detail in the
6761940	6765420	character design like you know that picture from Final Fantasy 3 of one of
6765420	6771360	the characters is so high-def and so detailed I think you kind of have to go
6771360	6775460	to old-school video games that quote use your imagination a little more because
6775460	6778780	you can't ever see the detail of clothes in a lot of games to know if they were
6778780	6787220	knitted or not you know well last email hey guys hey for festivals slash
6787220	6791020	December wien one of my friends gifted me with her PlayStation 2 which she no
6791020	6795780	longer uses nice gift this extremely this is extremely awesome considering
6795780	6800940	that one of my evil exes took my old ps2 the downside is that the only ps2 game I
6800940	6804820	still own his Final Fantasy 10 how about helping me to rebuild my ps2 library by
6804820	6807220	suggesting a few good games for me to buy thanks
6807220	6813340	tiara ps I'm gonna rob I want to be on hardhouse 11d I wanted her on last week
6813340	6817540	but it didn't work out so I'll talk to you offline tiara we do want to have you
6817540	6822620	on as a guest so maybe next week we got to find a Thursday that you're free but
6822620	6828900	anyway ps2 games ps2 games I silent any of the silent Hills absolutely no games
6828900	6834340	actually I would say get Silent Hill 2 & 3 if tiara owns Final Fantasy 10
6834340	6839300	then I'm gonna I'm gonna guess that she's a roleplay game type fan so
6839300	6843580	definitely 10 to 12 was horrifically underrated because it came out right
6843580	6849500	with the news yeah that's a good one I think the dot hack games were always
6849500	6853220	really underrated it's that whole simulated MMO thing but they're a little
6853220	6856740	more action II I think those are really good to look into I can't remember the
6856740	6861580	name of the first one it's dot hack volume one infection thank you Dan
6861580	6867740	Daniels magic pen gel was an underlooked RPG game that's where you could draw
6867740	6871100	wieners and then they could go into battle and stuff we had a lot of fun on
6871100	6875500	that with that game in the early days of the show and graffiti Kingdom of course
6875500	6879740	there are tons and tons of DDR games if you want to get your music game thing on
6879740	6883260	amplitude and frequency are both very good games even though you can't play
6883260	6887820	amplitude online anymore I get the space channel 5 package their space channel 5
6887820	6891500	part 1 & 2 were released together combined I'm unwinding my thing and I'm

7049780	7055180	I passed algebra so I'm gonna say F you to the Photoshop selection tool that's
7055180	7063620	it Loki do you have an FU of the week I yeah F you the Comcast surprise yeah no
7063620	7068980	big surprise yeah fuck them for not being able to hook up my cable correctly
7068980	7075540	it apparently takes them numerous crews to do something very simple like running
7075540	7078860	a drop to the street apparently they have a crew that specializes in
7078860	7082340	underground installations oh but that crew doesn't know how to actually hook
7082340	7085660	up anything they have to send out another crew to hook it up to the street
7085660	7088940	oh but that guy doesn't know actually how to hook it up to the house and send
7088940	7092500	another guy to the house to hook it up at the house oh but that guy needs to
7092500	7096460	have you know a person assess what needs to be hooked up first so they have to
7096460	7102620	send somebody else out why don't you just I don't know train everybody for
7102620	7106380	everything because I'm sure it's not going to be that difficult to teach

7281500	7292980	stories and then the Skype like Dan get a mic or GTFO all right 1877 game olr
7292980	7297820	just a little bit right after two more stories for you guys Loki when I first
7297820	7302620	saw this headline I was like sweet Xbox is finally getting all risque cuz they
7302620	7308900	said goodbye gal gun panties I was like ooh I didn't think they would go there
7308900	7312940	but no it's not unfortunately what I thought it was they're actually
7312940	7318500	censoring the game and removing the panty shots so now you know the chick
7318500	7324100	has a different angle in her here per ponytail houses me covering her panty
7324100	7329140	line and that kind of stuff apparently I guess 79 days before the game's released
7329140	7334900	in Japan Microsoft call the meeting with the gal gun developer alchemist and they
7334900	7340740	just basically said you know what we're gonna have to censor the game and not
7340740	7346700	put all these panty shots in there but that's the point how are you gonna sell
7346700	7354980	the game now they're saying now I don't know that they're just basically because
7354980	7363340	I guess the game I don't know if the game uses the connector whatever maybe
7363340	7369020	that you know they're trying to gear more towards like a family gamer now I
7369020	7374500	don't I think they really game is fun for the whole family hot chicks bending
7374500	7381580	over XNA game come on XNA here's something you use the connect for
7381580	7387420	spanking when those when those naughty girls bend over you can spank them with
7387420	7391500	the connect come on you know you want it what spanking game yesterday the Loki
7391500	7400700	not my forte but you know the way for that who am I to judge other people you
7400700	7405620	are here's here's a great story you're in love this and this is totally a time
7405620	7411300	with what we're talking about and stuff there is a comic that was on Kotaku the
7411300	7416700	ran a thing it was a visual guide to in fact I gotta find it real quick so I
7416700	7422340	can show you in studio here is a visual guide to the ESRB and it showed a chick
7422340	7429540	so and she was segmented as it went down so the E was her head T was you know her
7429540	7437700	cleavage M was you know her naked naked vagina I guess censored obviously
7437700	7445660	because it's you know it's classy and AO was tentacles sneaking up and now he's
7445660	7451580	like what is that like it's it's tentacle rape and well it's something
7451580	7460620	that's popular in Japan what she was unaware of the whole tentacle rape scene
7460620	7464300	I guess you know Tiger Claw in our chat room says maybe it's the game parents
7464300	7469620	will use when kids ask them where do babies come from they go solar flare in
7469620	7472780	our chair in the chat dot orange on twitter.com says Rob spanking teaches
7472780	7479660	kids to hit one more story for you guys and has to do with indie games and the
7479660	7486060	Humble Bundle Humble Bundle 2 was released this past week and in less than
7486060	7491780	24 hours after its release it got over $500,000 in revenue this is notable

7512620	7519940	with the whole Minecraft stuff Infinity Ward's Robert bowling spent $500 on the
7519940	7523300	pack so there you go the average price that people are paying for this seven
7523300	7529180	dollars and change the pack comes with braid cortex command machinarium osmose
7529180	7534020	and revenge of the Titans you can divide your payments between the developers the
7534020	7538660	electronic frontier front foundation and child's play charity so in other words
7538660	7540940	if you don't want to pay the developers you want a hundred percent of your
7540940	7545660	donation go to child's play go for it that indeed is some developers being
7545660	7550500	very humble in allowing that to be sold very cool twitter.com slash humble for

7613380	7616980	you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is excellent hi excellent what's
7616980	7620420	on your mind buddy you forgot about one game series in particular for the ps2
7620420	7625740	and I'm quite upset at you for doing this Rob all right persona series ah I
7625740	7629900	thought somebody in chat said persona and I said it my bad no anything actually
7629900	7634980	any title with Atlas is pretty much gold I haven't come across really one game
7634980	7638820	from Alice is really so terrible that would not talk about it actually they
7638820	7643460	have a really good game on ps3 a demon sword or no what am I thinking nope nope
7643460	7648420	scratch that demon souls is the game that's out on ps3 that's that's a great
7648420	7652500	ps3 exclusive game in fact I believe it was just given a price reduction because
7652500	7656500	in the greatest hit series and servers think one of the stories that missed our
7656500	7659580	show all this week but I remember reading the servers are gonna be open
7659580	7665940	through at least March 2011 if not beyond I think definitely if you're
7665940	7671260	looking for a long series of playtime with a role-playing game dot hack series
7671260	7675980	is really really good there was the four games and then there was three for the G
7675980	7680100	the GU which was happening right after so they keep the storyline pretty much
7680100	7682860	intact throughout the whole thing but it's really cool how you can take your
7682860	7687220	safe game from the first up from the first game but in the second take their
7687220	7690820	stages the second game into the third the third game into the fourth so you
7690820	7694780	can carry it on and then if you take it and put into the new series which
7694780	7699300	happened few years after that they'll give you cool bonuses for doing so so I
7699300	7703500	it pays to play it's really good ray craft in our
7703500	7706980	Chatham is correcting me saying demon souls isn't an atlas game they just
7706980	7713900	published it well still still is a great game but it has their name by it so SSJ
7713900	7718340	100 they don't put their name behind sucky game so right as we don't get
7718340	7721860	president cat and everything will be well exactly they need yet at president
7721860	7725860	cat SSJ 100 Matt is also saying Disgaea now there's there's a good good
7725860	7731260	suggestion and also also if you happen to be in a Japanese region earth defense
7731260	7737340	force 2 ooh good thought very good thought so what else is on your mind
7737340	7740380	excellent what anything else fun and exciting going on in your gaming world
7740380	7743100	well I don't know well I'm kind of disappointed you have invited me onto
7743100	7747580	your show yet either considering that was the number one achieving core and
7747580	7750900	your guilt for quite a while if I remember correctly before it's there
7750900	7757180	someone took my spot but that's quite okay because you know I'm not gonna be
7757180	7761020	better anything about that and you shouldn't be there's been thankfully
7761020	7764460	there's been a lot of people that have wanted to be on so we're trying to give
7764460	7769300	everybody a shot I know I'm playing rice princess was only on because we kind of
7769300	7773700	needed someone in someone quickly so she came back on twice but we're gonna get
7773700	7778700	we're gonna get lots of people on so that's cool but yeah I'm very much
7778700	7783080	enjoying cataclysm keeping up to the wee hours in the morning playing all the
7783080	7788860	different stuff for how many hours have you spent on your archaeology only you
7788860	7793820	know what it hasn't been that long believe it or not I spend almost
7793820	7798940	probably in my two days probably give or take wow that's still a long time you're
7798940	7808740	probably only up to level like 200 or I'm 420 I'm almost 425 20 or 25 nice I
7808740	7814580	got excited because today I'm doing fossils or whatever and my next dig is
7814580	7819260	going to be a pet oh there you go some pet the Raptor right yeah the little
7819260	7823340	Raptor fossil raptor so that's that and actually makes me jealous because some
7823340	7826340	of the battlegrounds now for like the mountain people met up there you think
7826340	7832980	version of it and actually this will make you really jealous because you're
7832980	7835820	an achievement whore and I'll leave you on this do you know what achievement I
7835820	7840060	got today hmm stood in the fire oh really you're

7847340	7851220	did you actually I actually survived not to turn this into the Wow show but I
7851220	7854980	actually survived because what I did I flew through the fire instead of getting
7854980	7858340	on the ground and like I don't the timing or something worked out I got the
7858340	7863380	achievement and didn't die my friend she was in ratchet and she actually lived
7863380	7866940	with like one hit point or something was weird but nice you couldn't believe it
7866940	7870180	she's like yeah I actually got an achievement but yet I live and she took
7870180	7873940	an awesome screenshot of the town I mean just totally engulfed in flames
7873940	7877900	everywhere I mean you couldn't even really tell it was bad for a bit because
7877900	7881740	of the flames in the background but it was a really cool screenshot good times

7925900	7930380	doing great so glad to have you back on the show what's new I actually came with
7930380	7935900	an agenda tonight Oh something that I believe you guys spoke about before as
7935900	7944060	per my conversation with Jamie but we have us olr madness we are currently
7944060	7948780	taking your top 25 lists and unfortunately we haven't received as
7948780	7952820	many as we would like so you know what it is they're a bunch of procrastinators
7952820	7958140	yeah I know but the deadline is coming up and and since us all will be on
7958140	7964260	hiatus just based on how the holidays fall Oh since we have you know Christmas
7964260	7969540	on a Saturday and then New Year's Eve on a Saturday yikes yeah yeah kind of puts
7969540	7972460	us in a little bit of a hiatus so I thought I'd come and you know be a pain
7972460	7977300	and you got in your ass and you know no worries on your show we did we think
7977300	7983980	it's great what you guys do over there why why why us l olr madness because it
7983980	7988060	is the way that you the gaming audience can actually get your voice out there
7988060	7994580	and be heard and you know show what the real games that people love are rather
7994580	8000500	than those that are just being you know highly profitable because people are
8000500	8004220	spending way too much money on stupid shit and it won't be rigged for Final
8004220	8009520	Fantasy 7 like the game facts contests are every year every year it's Final
8009520	8016180	Fantasy 7 something yeah exactly now father seven could we could win it has
8016180	8021540	been in the top like 16 but I don't believe it's won a madness title yet I
8021540	8025420	don't believe so I don't say for certain but I don't believe so I don't think any
8025420	8028620	Final Fantasy game has come to think of it I know Super Metroid's one chrono
8028620	8032460	triggers one and I think Mario Brothers 3 has won a couple times and chrono
8032460	8036940	trigger is up there very very very far it's all the listeners wanting to spite
8036940	8043780	me for saying it's overrated if anybody wants to get their top 25 listed and has
8043780	8049900	not yet just go ahead and formulate your top 25 list send it to usl madness at
8049900	8056540	gmail.com we will tack it on in with the rest of the votes and deadline is
8056540	8061540	January 3rd so get your votes in and we will be starting right after the
8061540	8066300	holidays excited to see it I'm trying to pull up my list that I had actually sent
8066300	8071140	to Bresl so I can give you a little taste taste of what I'm rooting for here
8071140	8074620	hold on I'm trying to pull it up my email archive here I said I set my list
8074620	8079020	on November 30th because I'm a very good boy you're a good boy um here I'll give
8079020	8083740	you just a little taste my number one game of course was Super Metroid I mean
8083740	8088580	it is the best game ever my number two game this year was the civilization
8088580	8093020	series I think between five out this year and four being so epic and the
8093020	8098180	original being so awesome I think Civ is deserving of a spot that high up and
8098180	8101980	just you know with five this year I was just like oh this is all amazeballs my
8101980	8106500	number three game was Castlevania Symphony of the night Metroidvania of
8106500	8110740	course you've got to put it up high up there and my four number four game this
8110740	8115060	year Final Fantasy six so I did put a file has a game in my top five um my
8115060	8117860	number 25 game I'm not gonna read the whole list for you guys my number 25
8117860	8120220	game this year cuz I always like to be controversial and put something kind of
8120220	8124540	like really random in there plants versus zombies you know I put plants
8124540	8128660	versus zombies on my list too oh maybe it'll make the top 64 then but that's
8128660	8132420	the weird thing is that John has been keeping good track of things and it has
8132420	8138500	not breached the top 25 recently hmm during the initial voting it was one of
8138500	8142260	the top 25 and it did get pushed out it's not even in the bubble zone right
8142260	8147620	now so well if you love plants versus zombies you better put it on your list
8147620	8152020	if you think plants and zombies is the greatest game ever made you better hurry
8152020	8155620	the hell up and get in there yes
8156100	8160220	awesome well what else anything else going on in your world Jessica sure
8160220	8165780	well I got a new computer and I have a brand new video card that I'm ready to
8165780	8170580	put into it but it is a slim computer and while I did get a low-profile card I
8170580	8176280	do not have the proper brackets for it so I'm in a holding pattern once again
8176280	8180320	and just waiting for my brackets so I can put my new video card in actually
8180320	8184140	start doing some decent PC gaming so I I actually had something similar happen
8184140	8188460	when I bought a new video card it was so uber it wouldn't fit in there with the
8188460	8192140	power supply so we had to get a new power supply as well to make it all work
8192140	8197660	yeah yeah no it's it's gonna be a very tight squeeze and I'm not quite sure
8197660	8200780	exactly how it's gonna work but I'll make it work dammit there you go so when
8200780	8206260	he's signing up for Wow no I'm kidding no I have a feeling that I might end up
8206260	8214100	with Star Trek online somewhere in my mailbox at some point I'm not sure so if
8214100	8216880	you want a 10-day trial let me know I may still have another card dark soccer's
8216880	8221380	recruiting we shall see we shall see all right oh yeah and of course that of
8221380	8225820	course Travis is a big fan of that too is Disney so yes I wouldn't be surprised

8261780	8266820	geek life Awards good check there all right orange lounge radio on skype or
8266820	8271500	1-877 game olr is the number to call we are taking some calls hi you are on
8271500	8275500	orange lounge radio hey hey it's Ron how's everyone doing tonight hey hey
8275500	8279420	Rama we're okay it's the end of the year shows shows running a little short
8279420	8283420	tonight surprisingly but you know I know this I was like wait they're already at
8283420	8288500	and the party already where the time go there's just it's it even though we try
8288500	8292260	to fill the show with lots of news sometimes the news doesn't have a lot of
8292260	8297620	discussion to go with it I mean there's not a lot to say to you know Shadow the
8297620	8302420	Hedgehog was made for Americans or whatever or yeah you know Sony
8302420	8308620	PlayStation shadow my two cents about the in the chat room yeah all right well
8308620	8314060	what's on your mind buddy why'd you call well to satisfy Brussels I finally sent
8314060	8320060	up my 25 cuz I realized I didn't play enough games this year to qualify so I'm
8320060	8324140	sitting there for about an hour putting my list together and picking the brains
8324140	8327660	of my roommates for what games did you like and I was like keep in mind it's
8327660	8333100	not the top 25 of this year it's the top 25 of all time I know but still I just
8333100	8336260	feel I don't really game enough for it but I got my list together and I sent it
8336260	8341220	out all right good boy and I did put on their Final Fantasy 6 good good man
8341220	8345600	that's a great Final Fantasy game although um Final Fantasy 4 I sometimes
8345600	8349600	call my favorite I gave it a little bit of a backseat which is funny because I
8349600	8354660	sent that list in before the news about the PSP version it will probably be back
8354660	8362620	near the top of my list next year after I play the PSP version so we'll see so
8362620	8365500	all right well what was at the top of your list can I be nosy what was your
8365500	8370040	number one game ever Scott Pilgrim versus the world the game what was your
8370040	8375660	number one game of all time I loved that game this is one the few games where I
8375660	8380900	sat there and played it over and over and over and this is one of those games
8380900	8384900	where yeah tap the bank for the crack that's that's what that game fell under
8384900	8389240	for me all right where every gamer has a voice even when those voices are insane
8389240	8394340	um just kidding I'm kidding if you like I never see ransom I mean really I'm
8394340	8398380	giving you shit actually I'm watching Loki in studios playing I think the new
8398380	8401420	version of Super Mario crossover like there was a brand new version that came
8401420	8406300	out but he is driving the blaster master car and that made me think oh man
8406300	8411840	blaster master should have been on my list blaster masters in Mario
8411840	8416420	crossover yes they just added Sofia the car from a blaster master is now in
8416420	8421220	Mario crossover version and it's awesome I now have my reason to play the game
8421220	8427220	I'm going to tell my roommate and he is going to he's gonna fangasm yeah I need
8427220	8431300	somebody to send in the top 25 list that has blaster master near the top to me to
8431300	8434180	make up for the fact that I left it off my list all right dark soccer says she
8434180	8437980	will I still haven't sent my listen oh good good I need some blaster master
8437980	8443140	love because I forgot so I'm an idiot we have to send this listen I believe the
8443140	8446700	third was the deadline but you're procrastinating but should do it right
8446700	8456380	now all right anything else in your mind tonight Rama yeah do you think
8456380	8464780	programmers purposely put code into games where you swear it cheats um it
8464780	8469220	depends on the type of game but like when you say games that cheat my mind
8469220	8474060	automatically goes immediately goes to Super Mario Kart and the whole rubber
8474060	8478660	banding and this is a very common thing you hear in racing games it's not Mario
8478660	8481820	Kart is not the only racing game that does it a lot of them do but I yes
8481820	8485740	that's that's basically program cheating is that if you are too far ahead of the
8485740	8488740	other contestants they get to speed boost or whatever to catch up to you
8488740	8492820	that's programmed to cheat to make it more exciting so heck yeah I think they
8492820	8496660	program cheating but that's just the difficulty or whatever you want to call
8496660	8502140	it I never had a problem Mario Kart but I can understand how you code a game so
8502140	8506660	there's some glitches here and there that may cause cheating but I'm talking
8506660	8510940	purpose gene for example my roommates playing Dragon Age he is in an area
8510940	8516580	where he has to go in and like take everybody out it's like his team of four
8516580	8520780	grown up of a team of eight says he walks into the area that whole team just
8520780	8524860	slaughters him under 15 minutes think screaming repulsive repeatedly at the
8524860	8529220	game is cheating with me personally I don't think the game cheat you just suck
8529220	8533420	but that that dates all the way back to the NES days when like you would be
8533420	8538740	playing a sports game or any time you gave RC Pro-Am was another racer that
8538740	8542820	would just infuriate people the game's fucking cheating man this game fucking
8542820	8551740	cheats actually put in purpose code for cheating compared to where your skills
8551740	8555740	aren't good enough padawan or it's just ramping up the difficulty keep in mind a
8555740	8558940	lot of those you know NES and if you want to go way back Atari 2600 games
8558940	8563820	we're set to loop over and over and over again so of course the difficulty gets
8563820	8568380	insane and harder than you know you're able to do at some point because that's
8568380	8573580	just you know what it is of course so like or take a game like civilization
8573580	8579740	and its highest difficulty level I believe the computer opponents can build
8579740	8584940	resources like 1.4 times as fast as you can so you have to really think about
8584940	8589740	how to you know use your resources well I don't think that's really cheating
8589740	8594540	the game is cheaper say that's just like advanced skill God mode it's like you
8594540	8597740	know what you're getting yourself into when you walk into it yeah and if you
8597740	8602140	can beat that then you're a fucking stud like you are like you but you know going
8602140	8605860	into it okay I am playing an uphill battle here and if I beat this I'm
8605860	8613580	awesome mm-hmm so yeah all right well Rama we're gonna let you go to try and
8613580	8617140	get some more calls tonight but thank you so much for your call have a going
