9426	24948	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, December 19th, 2010, Cataclysm sells oodles and oodles, a crime victim calls for the ban of Mafia 2, and K'nex's first sex game gets the smackdown from Microsoft.
31434	37055	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37175	41476	December 19th, 2010, episode 394.
41956	44657	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
44717	48757	Join us live in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
49278	50178	My name is Rob Roberts.
50218	55019	I'll be with you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
55239	55539	Yo.
55739	56259	How you doing?
56639	61185	I'm doing well and energized and electrified.
61365	62146	Electrified.
62306	66171	Gosh, you sound, I don't know, like you've just been to Xanadu or something.
66231	66591	I don't know.
66651	68033	No, I saw Tron twice this week.
68353	69415	Oh, wasn't Tron amazing?
70616	70896	I know.
71257	72679	Okay, I'll get into that in a minute, though.
72739	76063	But I have to introduce, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
77301	78582	Hi How are you doing, Loki?
79042	103758	Uh, fine You know, I remember a time when you really hated all things Apple And now it's funny, because at the start of the show I'm always having to tear you away from that new little eye touch you have Or you've had for a couple months now No, you see, I hate all things Mac, not Apple Oh, my bad Because Apple, too, was a pretty awesome computer back in the day It's true, it's what we all played Oregon Trail But I'm sorry, all those Mac computers are way too damn overpriced
105639	108220	Making friends, and we're not even five minutes into the show.
108581	110442	It's just the three of us here in studio tonight.
110482	114144	Sadly, no guests joining us, but it is our last show of the year, if you can believe it.
114644	117586	We're not going to be here because of the holiday next week, sadly.
117706	122909	Sorry, but some of us are going out of town, so we're not going to be able to get everybody together to do the show next week.
122929	124310	So it's our last show of 2010.
125991	129033	So, don't worry guys, we'll be back, of course, in two weeks.
129053	131355	And we have plenty of show to go to tonight.
131715	134377	So, we always like to start things off with, how was your gaming week?
134417	139340	But, can I just say, OMG Tron, like, wasn't it great?
139860	140241	I know!
141281	142722	So, you got to go see it, what, Tuesday?
142762	143443	How'd you swing that?
144071	147612	Well, Jessica Harper had an extra ticket.
147772	149233	Yeah, she was on the show a few weeks ago, right?
149273	151973	Yes, and she let me have it.
152654	153374	And so we all went.
153854	154154	Nice.
154914	155454	And what'd you think?
156015	157595	Oomph.
158515	159556	What was the best part?
159656	167398	Well, without spoiling, because keep in mind there's a lot of people that are like, OMG, you don't want spoilers, so is there a way you can kind of say the best part of the new Tron movie without ruining anything?
170163	170904	Not really.
171645	173387	Because I like how everything flowed together.
174368	176651	But I'd have to say that I have a favorite line.
177332	177572	Okay.
177673	179435	As we've discussed earlier, but I'll go ahead and repeat it.
180596	182479	The cycles haven't been good, have they?
182959	183680	You don't look that bad.
185282	186342	Very nice, very nice.
186623	188723	Loki, you got to see the Trons as well.
188983	189584	Yes, I did.
189764	190544	How was Tron for you?
190684	191664	It was awesome.
191904	193625	It was just everything I was hoping it would be.
194845	196366	So I would definitely see it again.
197426	198987	And everybody here saw it in 3D, right?
199247	199987	Yeah.
200867	208250	Honestly, this is a movie that it is totally beneficial to see it in 3D because I'll just say Wizard of Oz Treatment.
208820	212363	Yes, it's not all in 3D, but it's very interesting.
213825	219090	And yeah, I would just say my favorite part was how they upgraded some things from the old movie.
220031	221732	How can I say this without spoiling too much?
221772	225356	But okay, y'all know there's going to be a light cycle sequence in it, right?
225596	234204	And when they did the whole light cycles, but some of the new stuff they did with it, like I'm doing hand motions here in studio, I was just like, oh, that is so cool.
234404	237111	That's so fucking badass.
237171	238715	I know, but I'm trying to be good.
239797	244207	If you actually go look on the Tron Wiki, they do explain that they're all different models.
244614	247637	Here's the interesting though, just kind of tie it back to what we're all about here at OLR.
247697	250299	It made me want to play the game like really bad.
250980	255364	And the game has not been kindly treated by the critics out there.
256264	259748	It's been getting like average reviews.
259868	263551	And when I say average, I mean like a six, which I don't know.
263571	266734	Usually when a game gets a six, that means it's really bad.
267995	271196	The movie is only getting like a 40% or something on Rotten Tomatoes.
271236	272477	This is not a movie for critics.
272877	274138	It's not going to win Oscars.
274838	277580	The dialogue and story are all nerd service.
277600	280061	But I honestly think like I walked out of that theater.
280441	281902	I was just like mind blown.
282343	288426	This is a movie worthy of like Star Wars, Star Trek, nerd opus, you know.
289100	304435	And on top of that, if you have seen the first movie several times and know it very well, and if you've kept up with some of the roundabout stuff, even some of the old deleted scenes, there is a lot in this that makes sense.
304475	312283	And you know, I actually went back and was listening to the soundtrack a bit, because keep in mind, I have the original soundtrack for the original Tron.
312443	313404	Oh, but the new soundtrack also.
314304	323248	When I went back and gave it a solid listen, some of the elements, especially for character theme songs, were incorporated from the original into the new.
324308	327930	I just have to say Daft Punk did an astounding job.
328170	332952	And I realize when people listen to the soundtrack the first time, they're like, this isn't like a Daft
333372	334612	It's not meant to be
349477	374340	and I'm not being a fanboy it would be a crime if Daft Punk didn't get nominated for the score because it adds that much to the movie like we don't need some artsy fartsy film stealing one of the nominations for score you know that's kind of like the same old same old that you always hear in a period piece this is something like really new and different I really hope it gets acknowledged I'm gonna spoil one thing there's nothing after the credits oh yeah okay that's not much of a spoiler
374625	379789	Yeah, but you know what else I really like too is how they gave the Disney castle the Tron treatment.
380029	380910	Oh, that's awesome.
380930	381671	That's so cool.
381691	385854	I really want to go see the Disney electronica thing, which I still haven't seen.
385874	387075	I have friends there right now.
387636	389898	We were supposed to go this weekend, but it just didn't work out, unfortunately.
389918	390518	Yeah, I'm glad we didn't.
390558	390998	You know why?
391219	392380	It rained the whole damn weekend.
392400	393020	It got rained.
393040	394221	They shut most of it down.
395943	397905	I had friends that went down there.
397925	399026	They still had a good time.
399046	399907	I'm glad to hear it.
400208	401149	I'm bummed I didn't go.
401189	403792	But at the same time, I had a great time at the movie.
404132	405514	Just awesome time.
405834	406876	I went and saw it at the Metreon.
407864	409445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
434984	436925	They think that's what it was and I walked by.
437125	446428	There's still an arcade in the movie theater and there was an arcade upstairs, the Tilt Arcade, which is right by the Walk of Game, which is still there.
447828	449669	I don't think they've updated it in a while, but it's still there.
450969	455130	It's kind of sad because they're selling all these arcade machines, but seriously, some awesome deals.
455470	458911	There's a Marvel vs. Capcom machine for $300 on sale right now.
459652	462893	A Beatmania 5th Mix, which is like the old school Beatmania.
462913	463893	Don't tell anybody because I'm going to buy it.
464693	464813	for $5,000.
465153	467075	It's a total rip-off.
467275	468617	That is ridiculous.
469317	470618	That is ridiculous.
470638	471079	I'm lying.
471119	471839	I'm totally lying.
473341	474181	It's really this much.
475102	475463	That's it.
476163	478545	Yeah, but Jamie wants it, so I'm not allowed to tell the listeners.
478705	479566	No, you're not.
480687	482208	So yeah, there's that.
482749	484571	Oh, this was the funniest thing of all, though.
485251	504461	going to the little claw or what not the claw machine you ever seen the ticket redemption machine where the light kind of goes around the marquee and you have to hit the stop button at a certain time and if you hit a stop button then you win a prize okay i posted this to my twitter do you know what one of the prizes was in there still in a sealed box a game boy advance e-reader machine with cards
509309	510190	I lolled so hard seeing that.
529843	538990	I think everybody, after going to see the movie that I went and saw it with yesterday, went online and started reading about Tron and who the actors were in the movie and how it tied into the 80s version.
539110	541072	It's that nerd-tastic.
541732	543354	Alright, how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
543454	544995	Actual video games outside of Tron.
545696	549379	Well, I'm playing World of Warcraft.
550519	550820	Addict.
551120	551660	No, I'm not.
552701	557485	No, I'm not because I'm still playing Star Trek Online and you can call me an addict for that.
557505	558106	Double addict.
559574	560335	I'm not addicted.
561896	563157	But I said I'd give it a chance.
564477	569181	And I was like, I was seriously this close, again, to just going, forget it!
569701	573263	Like, by this close, I mean like holding my fingers, you know, a half an inch apart.
573884	576505	It's like, stupid goat people, world sucks!
577526	578846	Even though I like playing goat people.
580467	584167	But I'm leveling faster, so I don't know what's up with that.
585187	588848	But it's cool chatting with everyone in the guild and everything.
588888	589588	That's pretty fun.
591429	593309	It still seems more of the same to me.
594329	595609	But I'm giving it a chance.
595649	596270	I'm somewhere new.
597210	597810	I'm playing.
598590	599690	Rob gave me some stuff.
600670	601711	I'll give you lots of stuff.
602071	603771	You have to play for a good month now.
604679	606061	Well... And it still looks the same, too.
624520	627802	Well, I mean, I didn't make it there last time I played.
627902	629883	And what's the name of the stupid... Darnassus.
630043	630603	Yeah, Darnassus.
631023	632724	Okay, it still looks like Night Elf stuff.
632884	633044	Right.
633164	635065	And Darnassus wasn't touched by Deathwing, too.
635225	637847	You have to... He didn't take a big poop on it?
637927	638287	He didn't.
638547	647471	But once you take the boat to the ruins of Albertine, which used to be Albertine, you'll start to see some of the damage and some of the better stuff, I think.
647591	652014	I figured that I'm going to do that when I get, like, 20 and I'm, like, what, 14 now and I've been playing three days?
652174	652334	Mm-hmm.
652774	653717	Yeah you've been doing very well
657336	659718	2 weeks to get to 20 last time.
660859	666324	So, I'm gonna keep going with it.
666524	667105	I mean, I'll try.
667685	673430	But like I said, you know, it's not something that I can keep doing consistently.
674331	676432	I'm keeping my attachment to Star Trek Online.
677874	680015	Which, by the way, Episode 3 of Star Trek Online came out.
681076	682798	Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.
683218	693727	Once Cataclysm settles down a little bit, I still want to go back and check out Star Trek Online.
693847	697730	Hopefully DC Universe isn't out by that point and derails everything.
698431	703455	I still want to go check it out a little bit, especially since they've changed so much since the beta that I originally had played.
704856	713500	I'd like to try out the new stuff, but I'm not going to buy two boxes of upgrades unless I'm sure I'm going to play a little bit more.
714040	719643	And even then, if I play, it's going to have to be in the form of month cards or something.
719903	724405	It's still ridiculous that they're charging so much for Wrath of the Lich King, and I think that will come down.
724585	726286	Just kind of have to wait it out.
726426	730628	Probably after the Christmas rush or something, it'll come down to try and woo new players into the game.
731408	733230	Well, that's kind of what I'm hoping for.
733330	735071	I mean, I'm not going to give up on it.
735171	741197	I mean, like I said, if I keep playing it, it's going to be, well, I'll buy a month card to play.
741657	747262	Because I'm not getting rid of my Star Trek Online subscription unless STO just starts getting ridiculously crappy.
748463	757210	and right now though my frustration with Star Trek Online is that there's really not a whole lot of new stuff for new characters and I want new factions.
759452	765056	They sort of teased that we're supposed to be getting Cardassian faction so I can keep up with the Cardassians.
766821	767882	Wow, that's a bad joke.
768362	769884	I'm not the first one to think of it either.
772906	775488	I want to play the Romulan stuff.
775508	777750	They're doing a lot of big stories for the Romulan factions.
778591	783916	I really, really like what they're doing with the story because they're putting something in it for everybody.
784056	784696	And it's like...
785717	786938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
803497	807801	I'll say, oh, and by the way, they did this in Star Trek Online and this, this, and it led to this story and this.
808401	814166	And she's like, sounds like you're talking like, you know, well, she hasn't said right out, but I feel like I'm talking about an episode.
814866	822212	And when they actually, when they bring everything up, it's like the way everything flows is like an episode of the show just without acting.
822372	831379	That's good because just as someone who is a fan of the Star Trek series, not counting Enterprise, I really wish they would have another show.
832040	833521	I really want there to be another TV show.
833841	839045	I understand that right now it's all about the movies and that new movie was awesome.
839526	846131	But I would just love there to be a new show in the next-gen Voyager canon, Deep Space Nine canon, you know?
846691	850914	I would like... Well, you know, and I've been going back and reading the books.
852175	859300	You know, the continuation books, which is really where... And this is going to be kind of a... I'm going to try not to veer too off the point.
860040	864143	The book universe is very different than the game universe.
864823	867165	The book universe is sort of like it's its own tangent.
868706	876450	What I like about the game universe is that it incorporated the first movie by saying that this is what happened in the prime timeline.
878012	880592	and the movie, as I said, is a new timeline.
881413	885833	So they can keep going with all these characters that you love and, you know, history that you know.
886914	898115	And I'd really like to see, you know, even them do like a comic series or new series, you know, involving the Star Trek Online universe or maybe the stuff that happened in between.
898796	899196	Who knows?
899336	900096	Anything's possible.
900276	901276	Because I love it.
901436	906817	And they've incorporated some of the Enterprise stuff in there too, you know, even though I think it's kind of crappy.
906997	907337	But, um...
909750	915337	I've been very, very happy with Star Trek Online, but like I said, I'm giving World of Warcraft a try.
916679	917399	I like my goat girl.
918260	921124	She's dressed like a hoochie right now, but she can burn things.
922706	926871	I do like, and I think this is new, the arcane missile thing.
927110	929471	It's not new, but you... It's new for me.
930691	944014	Everything is at different levels now, so you might be getting it sooner than you would have before, because they rearranged everything when they did Cataclysm, and some people get talents at a really early level that they wouldn't have seen until level 40 before.
944154	947075	This Arcane Missile thing, they're just like, here, have this for free.
948015	948255	What?
949136	950557	And you don't have to, it's just random.
950577	952838	You can randomly cast it and it doesn't cost anything.
953338	954119	And it's instant.
955600	957941	And you can kill lots of stuff with it.
957981	959802	Thinking you specced for it somehow.
959862	963164	So that's kind of, yeah, usually those free things are usually some type of speccing.
963305	965126	But, you know, that's spending talent points.
965166	966126	You spent your talent points.
966146	967967	No, I had it before I got my talent points.
967987	968148	Oh.
969669	972330	I don't play a mage, so I have no idea how it works.
972691	976714	I'll double check my stuff real quick because it's not going to show anything.
976874	980916	I did pick Arcane Path, but I had everything before that.
981217	982297	I think it's important.
983118	985019	I don't want to veer off the path too much.
985219	987241	Although I lost my pet, I don't know how to get it.
987481	993723	But I do think it's important for WoW veterans to hear how newbies approach WoW.
994124	998045	Because I think sometimes the WoW veterans just assume people come into WoW and they know everything.
998245	999325	And it's hard.
999365	1000706	There's a lot to the game.
1001206	1008569	So I think it's important that if you're a veteran of WoW, you sometimes kind of hear what the new people are really thinking and some of the challenges and so forth.
1008957	1010958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1036625	1038926	Let me look at chat room really quick because we want to get some questions out.
1038946	1040887	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1041247	1042467	Quick question from Breakman.
1042547	1044268	Are the Star Trek cartoons canon?
1045909	1046149	Yes.
1046549	1048810	Actually, the animated series is considered canon.
1049350	1049670	All right.
1050633	1054375	Breakman is also asking, do newbies still have to go find that wife in the Barrens?
1054535	1055555	I don't think so.
1055675	1057296	I don't play Horde, so I'm not sure.
1058096	1060457	Still have to get the stupid mushrooms.
1060617	1062698	Hate the mushrooms.
1063238	1072382	Due to the shift of Burning Crusade, or I'm sorry, due to the shift of Southern Barrens being its own zone now, I don't believe that quest is there anymore.
1072722	1075103	Stupid, stupid mushrooms.
1075123	1077103	But see, that hasn't changed, but you'll get there.
1077163	1080144	Yeah, and then someone had to start in Badger, Badger, Rob.
1080164	1082425	That was already in my head.
1082525	1083265	Let's move on.
1083385	1084885	Loki, is there any games you've been playing?
1084905	1087366	I know you don't play any MMOs right now, so what have you been up to?
1088926	1093568	I've been just playing Grand Theft Auto and Sword and Poker 2.
1093608	1094728	Playing lots of Sword and Poker 2.
1100913	1105737	Oh, and I did actually play a little bit of... Now, it's a little confusing because I have both Tron games.
1106057	1109059	I have the Tron Legacy game and then also the Tron game.
1109159	1110600	But I played Tron Legacy a little bit.
1111301	1113062	And it's alright.
1115443	1119186	You race around in light cycles and the recognizers.
1119326	1119486	But...
1122909	1125873	I just don't like tilt steering.
1126414	1128517	I hate tilt steering in everything.
1129278	1131681	It's just, it's not, it doesn't feel natural.
1131981	1134745	So you must be playing it on PS3 with the six axis or what?
1134966	1135867	No, on the iPod.
1137266	1137987	Oh, okay.
1138047	1139168	I thought these were the retail games.
1139928	1141530	No, no, no, no.
1141710	1145994	It's just tilt steering on the iPod to steer the bike.
1146254	1147435	I hate that.
1148036	1148816	Okay, got it.
1149157	1151719	I prefer my finger.
1151739	1155943	Yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.
1156243	1157164	I didn't play a whole lot.
1158626	1160227	It's too busy yelling at Comcast.
1161047	1163369	Oh, the internet's been down for still, right?
1163409	1165050	You were down last week and you're still down, right?
1165730	1167431	They're dumb, okay?
1168932	1169493	They're dumb.
1170513	1185102	We'll just put it that way and no, Comcast really doesn't care despite the fact, you know, what certain Twitter people will say and how they may seem concerned and ask you to email them and then they don't give a shit once you've emailed them, so.
1185362	1185762	You mad?
1185782	1186403	Yeah.
1187423	1188964	Just slightly.
1189865	1194328	I'll be canceling TV with them, actually, because I'm pretty pissed off.
1194468	1199391	And it's not working all the way, too, because I can't use any of the on-demand stuff, because the signal's not strong enough.
1199872	1200432	That sucks.
1201012	1201513	Sorry to hear it.
1202093	1207296	Thankfully, thank you to my new Virgin mobile phone, though, that I have rooted.
1207657	1214841	I can now tie into the Wi-Fi on that to connect to 3G networks, so that has been a lifesaver, I tell you.
1215282	1215722	There you go.
1217420	1233623	my gaming week has been mostly dominated with World of Warcraft Cataclysm I won't kind of go all the way back into it but I hit level 85 which is the new max level this week so shut so that's and I've been just trying to gear for heroics and I am geared for heroics now so I'll be doing that soon
1234384	1236785	As far as other games go, not anything new.
1236965	1244227	Just some of the same old standbys like Rock Band 3, Super Meat Boy, and some of those games I've just been playing gradually over the past month.
1244887	1245807	But not a whole lot.
1245827	1249789	You know, with the holidays coming up and everything, my gaming time has been kind of thin.
1249829	1261432	But the good news is, with the huge break coming up, I don't know about some of you out there, but I have been given at work, basically, the entire time between Christmas and New Year's off.
1262032	1287786	our company does this whole like closure thing where we have to take time off basically which is you know I'm not gonna lie I kind of welcome it so it's gonna be a nice break but I don't know what to do with myself for like nine days off in a row I can't really afford to take any major trips right now so uh I guess I'll sit at home and play some games so that's good though because I really need to just catch up on some things so hopefully I'll get some gift cards for Christmas or something and go buy myself a couple new games and beat them that'd be great
1289031	1291393	DarkCircuitry Internet equals Warcraft equals Rob's life at least
1312435	1313375	Not totally.
1313515	1315676	I mean, yeah, I spend a lot of my free time playing Warcraft.
1315696	1318696	But let's not forget, it just had a major expansion.
1318736	1321217	Its third expansion just came out like last week.
1321277	1323937	So of course, you know, that's kind of the focus right now.
1324017	1327498	But, you know, that'll die down once I've really experienced a lot of the new stuff.
1327558	1330819	I don't really plan on rolling in alts or, you know, getting through all that and all that.
1331219	1333199	So I'll have time to play a new game.
1333599	1335240	And yes, I know how to go outdoors.
1335300	1336780	I was in the city all weekend.
1336840	1340021	So I do more than just sit on the computer and play WoW.
1340041	1341001	But that is a lot of what I do.
1341081	1341361	It's fun.
1342634	1343435	DarkSakura.com
1367846	1391213	I'm growing in my netbook there you go stay connected and yeah I will just you know Loki and I will just be taking some time off for the holidays so we won't be here but we will be back the week after in the new year with a new show otherwise if you want to follow us on Twitter for all the updates about our show twitter.com slash OLR also be taking your Twitter topics there facebook.com slash orange lounge radio as well
1392954	1399216	More comments from our chat room, chat.orangelongestradio.com Tigerclaw says, Sky will just play Cataclypse for nine days.
1399417	1401117	No, I'm not going to play for nine days straight.
1401457	1402218	I'm not going to lie.
1402378	1404579	I'm going to play a lot with the time off.
1404599	1405899	I'm not going to play the whole time.
1405960	1406340	Come on.
1406740	1410181	Besides, I have Knights of the Clicky on Facebook I've got to be playing too.
1411862	1413143	Someone sent me an invite to that.
1413303	1413763	No thanks.
1414803	1415784	It's a real time waster.
1416344	1420849	Jim Sally in our chatroom says, if you're bored next week, Rob, do a show every day.
1421330	1422972	There's three hours taken care of.
1423472	1424373	That would be kind of fun.
1425134	1425855	But I don't know.
1425915	1428638	I think I'd run out of things to talk about and then it would get kind of scary.
1429239	1430640	Would the listeners help me do a show?
1431381	1433764	You can talk about all the stuff coming out.
1434945	1436767	Wait, no, no.
1437368	1444035	There's already a bunch of live shows at All Games Radio where we do our show, and obviously we wouldn't want to bump any of those shows.
1444075	1444976	We don't have the right to.
1445057	1447579	There's plenty of fine shows on the network, so...
1448942	1451403	Let them do their thing and we'll see.
1453024	1458586	William Murderface in our chatroom says, I love that name by the way, Rob, you need a drunken Rocky marathon.
1460607	1460927	I don't know.
1461468	1463048	I've been doing Rocky for so long now.
1463088	1464589	I don't think I need to marathon it.
1465149	1465609	There you go.
1467670	1471112	And JV Mon in our chatroom says, Oh yeah, more people need to play Pinball FX2.
1471232	1471632	Agreed.
1471972	1473453	Pinball FX2 is great.
1474293	1475754	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com
1476724	1478645	Let's go to some gaming news.
1478745	1482386	Believe it or not, there is still some going on this week, even though it is the holiday period.
1482426	1482726	Loki.
1483366	1483606	Yes.
1484746	1489388	So apparently Microsoft is wanting, obviously, to improve upon what they've already created.
1490028	1492288	They want to quadruple the Kinect's accuracy.
1492328	1498830	And the way they're going to do that is by unrestricting the camera from the 320x240 pixel resolution range
1502011	1524885	to unlock it to 640x480 and unfortunately they can't do that right now because of the limitations put on by the console's USB controller interface which has to keep open enough to support other USB based peripherals like batteries and rechargers but if they somehow enable it to where you know they
1526437	1527077	Thank you for watching!
1548268	1578000	so that's kind of cool and they said that can all be accomplished with a firmware update so um that is kind of cool and kind of makes you wonder why it wasn't there in the first place well they said right there it's because of the limitations of the console because right now they have to you know they have to play nice with all the other peripherals on there um I don't under well I mean I guess the USB controller so I was gonna say I don't understand why they couldn't just unrestrict the one port for the Kinect but um I don't know it would be difficult to do that uh
1579326	1582967	As long as whatever they do doesn't impact the older consoles.
1583027	1586628	Like, that's my fear is that, you know, as they keep talking about, we're going to upgrade all this stuff for firmware.
1586648	1587888	We're going to do all these upgrades.
1588549	1591809	Oh, but if you have the old white Xboxes, then you're fucked.
1592250	1593730	It's only going to work with the 360s.
1593890	1596831	You just need the adapter that comes with it, but...
1597871	1599372	I think that's just for power.
1600412	1603333	They just have more power coming through there.
1603393	1611417	I guess what they could do is say, when running the Kinect, you can only hook up one device or two devices or something like that.
1612217	1614558	Maybe that's the way they could get around it.
1615678	1616018	I don't know.
1617019	1622481	It's a little tricky, but I could see them doing it, especially if it's going to make things that much better.
1624202	1626283	But at the same time...
1627783	1632627	We really need the games to be four times better anyways.
1632747	1644536	I'm not convinced that even if you make the technology better that there's enough games with really new ideas there yet to substantiate it, if that makes sense.
1644596	1654424	Dance Central is awesome, but as far as a lot of those other adventures and those sorts of games go, the fitness games, I'm kind of over it.
1654444	1654804	Show me...
1656665	1662088	How Kinect is going to make my life as a gamer even more awesomer.
1662428	1663888	And yes, that's a term, more awesomer.
1665909	1667730	You know, show me how Kinect's going to do that.
1668771	1671512	Kinect is still kind of a flashy...
1673386	1678831	I haven't seen it really truly integrated into the hardcore games that I'm used to.
1679331	1679812	You know what I mean?
1680032	1680573	Yeah, I know what you mean.
1681313	1692343	So at one point I'm kind of like, don't waste your time with this upgrade to the technology unless you have the games to kind of back that up that aren't just more exercise games and more dance games.
1692383	1700188	Well, I think they're just working on having that available for when they do get to that point as far as game development goes.
1700208	1705792	Because, yeah, some of the stuff that is available right now, it's very basic with what they have you doing.
1707633	1720562	Dance Central is a pretty good example of what it can do, but some other games that kind of just have these modes tacked on, like Harry Potter and stuff, where it's just an on-rails thing that you... It's very unnecessary.
1720642	1722023	I mean, I don't know.
1724305	1730632	They need less fitness games, less snowboarding-esque games.
1733385	1734766	Just some better ideas.
1735406	1738007	Go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1738407	1741469	Dara Gage wants to give a cheap plug to connectable.net.
1741969	1743530	Games are only scratching the surface.
1743570	1744390	You know, that's a good thought.
1744410	1746011	I'm looking at some of the stuff here that they have.
1746031	1748612	And, of course, I've been kind of reading about the hacks on the Internet.
1748632	1755416	And this website, connectable.net, seems to be kind of a collection of the different sorts of hacks that are out there, like lots of YouTubes.
1755456	1760118	And I'm seeing things like an air piano where you can use your hand to play the piano.
1760898	1761239	on Kinect.
1761259	1768184	I mean, it's not exactly like a real piano, but still, it's an impressive little thing that they're doing with the technology.
1768564	1776550	You gotta wonder if Microsoft's kind of letting this hack thing go a little bit just to see what people are coming up with so they can steal it.
1776670	1777250	You know what I want?
1777711	1778611	The Kinect's theremin.
1780913	1782254	This is me being serious.
1782874	1783915	Because I really want a theremin.
1784295	1785336	Maybe Kinect music.
1785616	1785897	Why not?
1785937	1788158	Since there was Wii music, let's have Kinect music.
1788218	1789139	And actually have it be good?
1789840	1790240	Perhaps.
1791231	1805498	Let's not, because once again we figured out that porting stuff over from the Wii or basically copying the ideas that you've done on the Wii is not exactly a great plan, because then a lot of these games just come out very cheesy.
1805898	1811941	I mean, even some of the games are just... I mean, like DECA Sports and Game Party.
1812041	1812581	I mean, it's just...
1813161	1814782	That's stuff that they have on the Wii right now.
1814802	1820944	We don't need a ton of minigame collections and little sports compilations and stuff like that.
1820984	1824325	Just come up with something cool.
1825505	1833108	And something that doesn't even necessarily need to use your whole body, like head tracking in a first-person shooter would be pretty awesome.
1833128	1835649	That would be actually really awesome.
1835909	1837669	It's completely optional.
1837749	1839490	Like to duck, you have to duck.
1839790	1841191	and you can like do that on your couch.
1841211	1841792	No, not even.
1841872	1842472	That's dumb.
1842612	1843212	Really?
1843293	1844573	Not even the ducking thing.
1844654	1849417	But I'm saying like you can poke your head a little bit to the side to kind of get a different perspective.
1849677	1851078	It's just a little bit more immersive.
1851358	1853780	Wouldn't take that much technology.
1854520	1858063	Could you imagine time crisis done with head tracking?
1858891	1861953	It would be cool, but I'm kind of sick of time crisis.
1862293	1871499	I mean, I'm just saying, I'm taking that concept to where, you know, say that you duck under, you know, a divider and you can peek over it and that type of thing.
1872400	1878324	But I'm just trying to think of a solution for, like, you know, people that want to play with controllers on a, you know, on a couch or something like that.
1878644	1881446	And they can make everything very minimal and optional.
1881686	1883687	I mean, you don't have to have...
1884688	1885249	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1906767	1910930	Very interesting comment because, yeah, Police 911 used a dance games technology.
1910950	1915454	It was basically Para Para Paradise, the setup, to kind of do this different sort of game.
1915474	1917175	All the, like, mo-cap boxing and all that.
1917195	1918896	Yeah, the whole mo-cap thing.
1919137	1923740	It was the same theory, but I'm saying that now with the Kinect, something like that is actually really possible.
1923960	1927023	Sure, just like, you know, Para Para is possible in the home.
1927043	1928784	That's that Dance Masters game.
1928944	1929605	Which I need to get.
1929825	1930345	Yeah.
1930726	1934368	Oh, I forgot to mention that for my thing, but I got a Kinect for Decemberween.
1935029	1935629	Congrats.
1935829	1936270	Yay.
1937523	1937723	All right.
1937883	1938544	For Festivus?
1939124	1939744	Decemberween.
1940244	1940825	Is that what you call it?
1940845	1941725	I'm going to call it Decemberween.
1941745	1942386	Decemberween.
1943246	1943546	Awesome.
1944547	1944787	All right.
1944807	1948028	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to lend your own comments.
1948449	1951450	Lots of comments there just kind of on that story.
1951470	1951890	I like that.
1952191	1954092	Well, let's go back to talking about WoW for a minute.
1954132	1957793	Sorry, guys, but I know some of you are WoW haters, and that's fine.
1957854	1959955	People are going to like what they like, but you can't ignore this.
1960395	1965157	World of Warcraft shatters a record this week yet again, and probably to no one's surprise.
1965577	1966458	Cataclysm is sold...
1966598	1967579	Thank you for watching!
1986129	1987291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2001528	2002109	Thank you for watching!
2019039	2021921	And I'm wondering, well, has Cataclysm launched in every country?
2022602	2024083	But certainly there's a gap there.
2024703	2026685	Well, that's only day one, I think, too.
2026705	2032549	I mean, some people, you know, couldn't make it over the day or waited a little bit or they're getting as a gift.
2032669	2037113	And I think some people are honestly having to wait like a month because, you know, the economy the way it is.
2037153	2044298	I know there's certain people in my guild that are like, I'm not going to be doing Cataclysm until the new year at least because just can't afford it.
2044358	2044879	It's too much.
2045499	2047621	So, you know, I think there's a lot of people that just...
2048101	2050642	Or is Cataclysm like a lot of that stuff like Endgame?
2050662	2054583	Because I could see maybe some people starting off there saying, eh, I don't need it.
2054943	2064206	A lot of it is because the stuff that affected the pre-Endgame, you know, the 0-60 experience, you don't need this expansion to experience any of that.
2064266	2070007	That was all a free upgrade basically because they destroyed the old world and ushered in this new one.
2071028	2071588	However...
2072208	2082198	The whole Worgen and Goblin experience, which are really well done starting areas, just as far as immersing in story and everything, you can't do unless you have Cataclysm.
2082418	2083579	So you can't do those new races.
2084159	2095911	But you can still roll a Draenei like DarkSakura is and at level 15 or whatever, head over to the other continent and experience some of the Cataclysm stuff without really needing the Cataclysm expansion.
2096651	2096751	So...
2097832	2098512	Kind of interesting.
2099093	2105195	Other important news out of Blizzard, and this isn't about WoW, but this could be about what ends up killing WoW.
2105575	2106075	That's right.
2106395	2109417	Blizzard might actually be making the game that is going to kill WoW.
2109457	2110697	They're making their own WoW killer.
2111537	2121601	Frank Pierce, in an interview with Destructoid, confirmed that the earlier rumor was true that the next MMO that they are making is called Titan.
2122021	2123822	At least right now, that's a code name.
2124062	2124522	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2153875	2157039	So, you know, take a lot of that with a grain of salt.
2157780	2163508	Anyhow, more quote here in the interview with Destructoid, quote, The media is not supposed to know anything about Titan.
2163828	2166872	It's our next-gen MMO, and we've only started... Excuse me.
2168180	2168781	Thank you for watching!
2189677	2198546	Otherwise, I'm kind of curious as to what this is, but they probably won't even do an announcement until like BlizzCon 2012 or something.
2198807	2199928	It's a ways out there, guys.
2200588	2209778	But it's interesting to know that that part of the rumor was true, because I think I passed it off on Horde House's fan wank, so sometimes I can be wrong about things.
2210559	2211600	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2212406	2221784	Pac-Man Fever nah you remember that song don't you yes I do of course I remember that song well so do the folks that song's older than most of our listeners you know
2222639	2224819	Well, so the folks at Rock Band, they remember it.
2224839	2227520	And actually, it came out the same year as Tron.
2228040	2228760	Awesome.
2229140	2233941	But the Pac-Man Fever album will be on Rock Band Download Content.
2235042	2236462	And that's supposed to be early 2001.
2236862	2243624	And it will have, as I said, Pac-Man Fever and Do the Donkey Kong and Froggy's Lament.
2244344	2247244	Just so you guys know, these songs were actually kind of terrible.
2248285	2249525	But pull up Pac-Man Fever.
2249685	2249845	Here.
2249905	2249985	Here.
2259063	2261945	Like, you know.
2262085	2264167	But it was popular when it came out.
2265748	2268250	I remember skating at the roller rink to this song.
2268491	2270953	So do I. I'm totally dating myself, but...
2277025	2278266	This song was really just written.
2278286	2280989	This whole album was just little video game tie-in songs.
2281009	2283191	It was really just written to cash in on the whole craze.
2284032	2284813	One-hit wonder band.
2286014	2287756	You don't want me to find the 7-Up commercial.
2288237	2289598	I've shown you the 7-Up commercial.
2289919	2292041	I think, yes, a long time ago on this show, yes.
2293403	2294484	But yeah, it's coming out.
2294584	2295965	I'd get it.
2296226	2298128	I wouldn't mind having some Pac-Man fever.
2298902	2300863	Skullcrusher Mountain Skullcrusher Mountain So there you go
2325247	2328109	The other songs on the album sound kind of funny.
2328129	2329710	I haven't really heard any of those other ones.
2329990	2332472	It's been ages since I've listened to any of the other ones.
2332552	2335634	I actually did have that on vinyl back in the day.
2336314	2336654	Wow.
2337935	2338696	That's a collector's album.
2338716	2341778	Hold on, let me pull it up here so you can hear a little bit here.
2341798	2344820	Here's a little bit of Do the Donkey Kong if you want to know what this song's about.
2354719	2358181	I got Pac-Man fever Alright, there you go
2371947	2388358	So when the whole ESPN streaming was announced for, or actually I'd say when it came out as part of the November dashboard update for the Xbox 360, some people unfortunately were unable to participate in that streaming.
2388778	2394983	And those would be folks that had Bright House, which is owned by Time Warner.
2397004	2398306	as their cable provider.
2398446	2405672	Unfortunately, those people were unable to actually get the ESPN app to work correctly.
2406613	2409416	But now it says, apparently...
2410997	2418463	And this is coming from the ESPN website.
2419124	2426690	The way it works, I guess, is when a Time Warner or Bright House user turns on their Xbox 360 and tries to access the ESPN app...
2427790	2451097	it'll direct them to the ESPN activation page where they have to authenticate their account with Bright House or Time Warner then it'll be given an access code once you have that you would I guess you're going to be able to actually use the streaming service now so that's kind of neat that they're not locked out of it anymore I guess some money exchanged hands or something like that
2451437	2453398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2477896	2481738	I always thought it was kind of weird that the whole Comcast logo was in the corner.
2481758	2482678	I'm like, it knows.
2483419	2484019	It's aware.
2484299	2491202	I mean, I know it's just reading my IP and so it can tell and probably the gateway I'm going through and what have you, but it always kind of struck me as interesting.
2492043	2492403	I don't know.
2492743	2496945	I don't know if I want to open this can of worms and make me sound even more ignorant, but whatever.
2496985	2498146	I've got to ask this question.
2498946	2523526	is the reason how Time Warner and all these companies are able to block this because of the fact that net neutrality didn't actually work out or was like they they found that it's not in the courts or whatever that it's not actually exists that that neutrality shouldn't exist because part of me says well how can Time Warner block this when it's on the internet
2525761	2538905	It's just like how they go in the squabbles with Fox or whatever will be all of a sudden blacked out on a certain cable provider because they don't want to pay certain royalties or whatever.
2539285	2546307	So it may have been that these, like Time Warner Bright House, didn't want to pay ESPN or whatever or...
2547931	2549533	Something to that effect, I'm thinking.
2549673	2551796	Well, right, but that's also not the internet.
2551876	2553097	That's TV.
2553217	2555099	So it always kind of fascinated me.
2555119	2556261	But it's TV content.
2556541	2560265	I don't know how that exactly works with streaming on the web and stuff like that.
2560806	2563829	And if you can get to it... Because I know some places you can't...
2566297	2572998	You can't stream certain games on the web depending on your location or something like that because of blackouts.
2573818	2577859	If you're a Time Warner user, would you be able to get around this just by spoofing your IP?
2579299	2579619	Maybe.
2579999	2580580	I'm not sure.
2582240	2585781	I bet there's websites out of there with more devious information than things I've read.
2585801	2586221	But you know what?
2586321	2591382	I'm not really going to pay attention to this whole streaming app until they have ESPN8, the Ocho.
2594002	2596844	with all sorts of extreme sports and Dodgeball.
2597064	2598805	Now, actually, I did try to watch.
2598825	2600466	Remember when Dodgeball came out and stuff?
2600486	2604189	And then shortly after that, they actually did have Dodgeball on one of the ESPNs.
2604229	2604789	That's right.
2604849	2605249	They did.
2606190	2607451	It was boring.
2608271	2610513	Goes to show you, it's just a movie.
2610653	2612734	It's not exciting in real life.
2612774	2616597	But it's an awesome 8-bit NES video game, just so you know.
2617217	2617597	That's true.
2617817	2619659	And a Game Boy Advance launch title.
2620319	2636646	It's just like if someone, you know, if for whatever reason they decide, hey, you know what, it'd be awesome if we have some people running around an arena throwing frisbees with little lights on the outside of them and playing tag, you know, kind of like Tron, but, you know, Disc Wars and stuff like that.
2637047	2639908	That would not be fun to watch more than once.
2641151	2646095	JV Mon in our chatroom asks, but Sky, why would you go out of your way to do that for ESPN?
2646516	2650079	If you're that into ESPN, you probably already have all their channels.
2650459	2657365	True, but I'm going by that hacker mentality of because I can, and I'm not going to be told no.
2658186	2662369	I mean, isn't that kind of why people install Linux on toasters?
2662509	2664211	Because they can, you know?
2665272	2667594	And you can't is not a suitable answer.
2668334	2670757	I consider that as I'm a power user.
2670918	2680870	So, you know, if I want Linux to be on my toast, then that would be kind of cool to put Linux on a toaster and then have it print stuff on your toast.
2681671	2682592	If that were possible.
2682653	2683674	They make a coffee printer.
2684360	2689323	ESPN3 is a paid service that the ISP has to buy, so spoofing your IP won't matter because the content can't get through the Time Warner routers.
2714800	2715441	It sucks!
2717422	2724728	Anyhow, Rama in our chatroom says, Sky getting into ESPN, he loses 20 gay points.
2724788	2725849	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
2726549	2728071	There's lots of gay guys that are into sports.
2728791	2736737	In fact, one of my best friends I'm taking to this game with me because he likes sports a lot and he likes basketballs and he happens to be too gay.
2736757	2737818	So there you go.
2738519	2739700	Anyhow, let's move on.
2740300	2741221	More news going on.
2742472	2745072	PlayStation app on the iPhone.
2745553	2747833	Not here yet, but here's the deal.
2748153	2750753	A PlayStation app has been announced for phones.
2751194	2756474	It's Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is releasing this, the official PlayStation app in Europe.
2757175	2761595	You're going to be doing some PlayStation Network interaction through your iPhone or Android device.
2762135	2762595	Let me think.
2762876	2767076	Could that be buying games and spending money and my points through the phone?
2767136	2768376	That's got to be one of it, right?
2768957	2771157	Yeah, you're not going to be playing games on this.
2771457	2772538	One would hope so.
2796815	2799237	Then again, we are sort of the red-headed stepchild of the world.
2799757	2814985	Well, it is interesting that with all these rumors we've had lately of the Sony phone and the photos of it in action and all that, that they are acknowledging at least that the iPhone still has a huge-ass market share, so they ought to put something official on it.
2815385	2823449	No, they need to stop wasting their time with this crap and actually deliver on the stuff that they promised way back in the day before all this stuff was coming out.
2823489	2831413	Like, for example, we would have trophy rooms in home where we can show off our trophies and they would be really cool interactive things and people could walk through and do that.
2832233	2833213	It's still not there.
2834514	2835194	What the hell?
2836575	2837055	Come on.
2837636	2840497	Do what you promised and stop wasting the damn time.
2841840	2842640	Loki's a little bitter.
2843060	2843741	I know, a little bit.
2843801	2844581	No, not that it matters.
2844601	2847602	I would never go in the home again anyways, because it's a waste of time.
2848322	2851364	I'll bag on Apple for a little bit for a minute, though.
2851404	2852984	Here's why Game Center sucks.
2853764	2858506	Because there's so much trash out there in the App Store, especially stuff that is free.
2858906	2862988	Like, I kid you not, I downloaded a free app the other day, and the game itself is alright.
2863548	2867870	But if you want to unlock, here's how you get quote-unquote achievements in Game Center.
2868570	2869551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2887061	2906950	there needs to be some type of quality control I feel like Microsoft's put a little bit more quality control in achievements granted there's some pretty asinine achievements out there too and some of them have to do with download content and things like that but I don't know I just look at Game Center and I go sometimes leaving this stuff wide open is a little too open but maybe that's just me
2908456	2937232	sometimes I just go lolz going back to ESPN3 for a little bit because I find this conversation in our chat room humorous at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Derek H says oh my god I'm checking out ESPN3 right now World Badminton Championships enough said but I like Breakman's follow up they could have at least called it the shuttlecock tournament nice there you go chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat with these folks I know right
2938066	2939729	How about something that has nothing to do with cocks?
2940490	2941592	Boring!
2942092	2942994	Alright, no, we can do it.
2943393	2950338	Well, there's been a call to ban Mafia 2 by the daughter of a Sicilian journalist who was murdered by the Mafia.
2952059	2954020	Well, the journalist was murdered, of course, not she was.
2954360	2956162	Her name is Sonia Alfano.
2956322	2962246	She is a member of the European Parliament and president of Italy's Association for the Family of Mafia Victims.
2963086	2966869	And I think she, basically, she's still grieving.
2967069	2967949	You know, it happened in 93.
2969430	2972572	Her father, Beppe, was murdered in January 93.
2974173	2975254	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2994524	2997547	And basically, it's dealing with the American Mafia.
2997727	3000750	You know, sort of like the Godfather and Sopranos, that type of thing.
3001191	3006496	And that they, you know, were trying to make it sort of a more realistic type thing, yet still be entertaining.
3006556	3011040	Not necessarily to glorify the violence in real life things, but to take the sort of...
3014995	3015916	Fictional world of it.
3016376	3020319	To take the fictional world of it, not necessarily glamorize it.
3020499	3024021	Well, here's the funny thing.
3024381	3027764	Obviously, I think this is a little bit too much.
3027824	3032367	You don't ban an entire video game just because something unfortunate happened.
3032407	3034488	And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to disrespect what happened.
3035048	3039031	That's terrible that she lost her father in a crime like that so many years ago.
3039251	3043014	I imagine that's something that you never get over, even though it's like 17 years later.
3045335	3048058	It's letting one bad apple ruin the barrel, so to speak.
3048698	3055144	At the same time, though, Take-Two's argument of, well, it's not the European mafia, it's the American mafia.
3055324	3064092	Okay, that's... I don't think that's specifically their argument, just that they're saying that it's set, you know, the whole Godfather Sopranos slash kind of thing.
3064312	3069396	I don't know why I'm reminded of this completely random conversation I was having last night on the train.
3081386	3085647	But Alan and I took Bart into the city to go to the Metreon to see Tron, right?
3086207	3091008	And while we were going down into the Bart Tunnel, I was commenting, wow, I have 3G signal in here.
3091488	3094449	I haven't had 3G signal in Bart Tunnel, I don't remember when.
3094469	3095789	They must have put a tower down here, right?
3096229	3102971	And he said, yeah, I think they put a cell tower down in the Bart stations a couple years ago, you know, so people could still use their phone when they're down here.
3103832	3116388	but it met with a lot of resistance for a while they didn't want to put it in I was like oh is that just San Francisco being hippies again they don't want more cell towers no apparently it had to do with the fact that when the UK bombings happened back in oh...
3119851	3129098	405, sorry if I'm misstating that, but back when those happened, when those buses went off, that was all triggered via internet and Wi-Fi or what have you, wireless signals.
3129439	3133261	And so they didn't want something similar happening in the San Francisco BART tunnels.
3133382	3134963	But I said, well, wait a minute.
3135303	3136344	You know, obviously...
3136824	3137524	We're not arguing.
3137564	3139285	He's just telling me the fact of the matter.
3139305	3141086	But my response is, wait a minute.
3142107	3148670	If somebody's going to do something stupid, they don't need 3G signal in order to be able to do it or not.
3149010	3151251	Well, this is my thing too.
3151631	3153012	My granddaddy died of cancer.
3153552	3154692	I don't have a problem with house.
3157174	3157854	Must be lupus.
3158703	3161368	I just know that they also I've just picked something hospital related so
3169185	3174667	I don't have problems with people that smoke other than that they usually stink.
3176088	3178429	But that's how my granddaddy got cancer.
3179569	3195776	Here's the other thing I think this gal needs to take into consideration is that if she's upset about this mafia video game, is she upset at the movie that comes out once every three months at least that also glamorizes the mafia and the crime and all that stuff?
3195836	3197717	Because there's an awful lot of movies...
3198319	3198441	Books
3201476	3202156	There's a lot of books.
3202297	3203217	The Godfather was a book.
3203237	3205098	Honestly, I think she's sensitive.
3206119	3207120	She has a right to be sensitive.
3207140	3213844	I understand she's sensitive, but at the same time, you don't take that out on everybody else.
3214785	3221129	That doesn't mean you ban a game from an entire country because you have that whole response to it.
3221149	3228134	I think that it's people taking their personal... Honestly, this goes back to one of the biggest things that I think is wrong with the world in general.
3228674	3229695	It goes back to that...
3232328	3233849	It's very selfish, I think.
3234629	3236591	And I'm not trying to belittle her grief.
3237431	3237812	Exactly.
3238072	3243236	But it's like, especially with the whole political correctness thing.
3244837	3251402	People spend so many time because one or two people are offended for something, but not the entire population.
3252503	3252803	You know?
3254134	3260718	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeontradio.com, Frisbee says, Remember, 3G and Wi-Fi didn't cause those buses to explode.
3260898	3261818	Explosives did.
3262259	3263299	Yeah, that was kind of my point, too.
3264700	3268502	Jvmon in our chatroom says, Does that mean Facebook will be taking off mafia wars?
3269502	3273645	William Murderface says, Is she mad at Jersey Shore for making Italians look like asses?
3276186	3277707	That's a whole nother topic.
3278047	3282371	This is my thing, okay, for example, and I actually get a lot of this living in California.
3282391	3284092	I'm trying to pick something neutral and something light.
3284893	3289617	I get the whole, oh, Alabama's full of rednecks thing, which I know for a fact it's not.
3290117	3290778	I'm from there.
3291178	3291859	Am I a redneck?
3292940	3296282	Well, Rob, you do get awfully excited over Chick-fil-A.
3297523	3298264	Chick-fil-A's delicious.
3298925	3302107	But I mean, I'm kidding, by the way.
3302668	3303829	Put the angry emails down.
3303889	3304229	It's fine.
3304674	3315019	But I mean, you know, a lot of people in the South are uber conservative, Bush loving, you know, gun-toting rednecks.
3315299	3318281	I mean, the stereotypes exist for a reason.
3319061	3324084	However, I don't get offended because I know they're not talking about me.
3325365	3330807	Now if they said all people from Alabama are freaking rednecks and all that, I'd be like, you know what?
3331508	3332108	That's not true.
3332888	3333889	Allow me to educate you.
3335629	3336550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3353622	3366534	But I'm saying that people, and I understand the concept behind wanting to make things better for other people, wanting to try to decrease opportunity for hate, if that makes sense, Rob?
3367655	3373080	But at the same time, I think that people are a little too sensitive.
3373965	3377729	I really like this comment and I think this is a good one to end it on and move on to another story.
3377829	3384435	Breakman in our chat room says people have the right to their opinions but they don't have the right to enforce their opinions on others.
3385416	3385857	Well said.
3386437	3386797	That's it.
3387698	3389360	I think the world just needs to be a little thicker skinned.
3389761	3408833	chat.orangeloungeradio.com or you can always email us if you have an opinion on that mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com I'd actually be really curious about this and this might be a dangerous place to go but that's okay we'll be a little bit dangerous here on OLR I kind of want to know if there's a game out there that has ever made someone
3410434	3414637	that has ever kind of offended someone in this similar type of manner?
3414657	3423463	And I'm not necessarily like, I don't want to hear your really upsetting story about something that happened in the family or whatever, but has there ever been something in a video game where you were just kind of like, you know what?
3423944	3425065	They really shouldn't have done that.
3426205	3429608	I'm just kind of curious if people can think of a case like that and email it to us.
3429648	3430949	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com
3443842	3447687	I'm saying that now we should know what the warning signs are, know what to stop.
3448128	3452774	There should be no legislation that forces one person.
3453455	3457401	It's something different when it's something that's beyond your control.
3458542	3462925	You know, now that we can learn from history, I think that that's one thing.
3463025	3466627	But I think that people do need to understand that there's just assholes in the world.
3467667	3469549	And people are, haters gonna hate, right?
3469829	3470469	Exactly.
3470749	3472290	It's my favorite saying in the world.
3472390	3478694	Just gotta be a little bit better than them, but you know, ready to put the stop when it actually is something that you can do something about.
3479014	3480595	You can't change minds.
3481676	3483317	You can't change the way people feel.
3483977	3485458	But you can change how you respond to it.
3486229	3486509	All right.
3489370	3495572	Kind of a comment here along those lines from Derek H in our chat room says, I did not like the airport scene in Call of Duty 4 at all.
3495612	3497993	I thought it was really fucked up and had no reason being there.
3499093	3500694	Chat.orangeaudrey.com or our mailbag.
3501274	3506716	I was really offended when Rockstar Games decided, hey, you know what?
3507236	3514661	For the Ballad of Gay Tony, we're going to make all the deathmatch multiplayer into smaller closed-knit locations.
3514741	3518684	Instead, the open-world Grand Theft Auto... Oops, dropped my iPod.
3519644	3526169	Closed-knit deathmatch locations, not the big old expansive open-world stuff.
3526369	3527610	That was very offensive to me.
3527850	3530351	I'm not sure we're on the same page, Loki.
3530692	3534194	I'm not sure you're quite seeing the same thing out of this topic.
3534554	3536055	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
3536475	3539618	Some more games are coming out, and I don't know if there's anything offensive.
3539658	3543780	I mean, it's the holiday week after all, but let's travel the world and see what releases are coming out.
3543800	3544481	We'll start with the US.
3546340	3547981	Not a whole lot coming out this week.
3552124	3553505	Mostly download stuff.
3554685	3555866	Actually, I shouldn't say mostly.
3556106	3557327	All of it download stuff.
3557767	3559949	So we're just going to talk about some download stuff instead.
3560850	3562251	The normal console releases.
3562771	3565553	Monday you're going to get Cosmo Fighters on DSiWare.
3566173	3576519	Darklight Dungeon on PC, FroBot on WiiWare, Mario Party 2 on Virtual Console, and Paul's Monster Adventure on DSiWare.
3577460	3583864	December 21st, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam will be coming out on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
3584544	3596577	and then finally on December 22nd, A World of Keflins and this is awesome, Back to the Future of the Game on iPhone, Mac, PC and PlayStation Network.
3597177	3600040	Hopefully Steam is having another Uber sale this holiday too.
3600240	3600761	That'll be nice.
3601280	3601540	Yes.
3602481	3603321	So keep an eye on that.
3604042	3609145	Alright, if that's it for the US, let's travel to Japan and look at the Japanese releases and what's coming out over there.
3609625	3614788	On the 22nd of December, Cybertroopers Virtual on Force comes out in Japan.
3614828	3617050	That's a regular and a box set edition.
3617830	3620752	There's a Twin Stick EX coming out in support of that game as well.
3620972	3622973	Yes, that's all coming out on the 22nd.
3623273	3628877	Since there's no show next week, I'll also mention on the 30th, Dream Club Zero on the Xbox 360 from Tamsoft.
3629617	3632299	Moving on to the PlayStation 3.
3633879	3635820	Nobunaga no Yabu Online.
3636401	3637741	Shinsei no Shuo.
3637901	3640343	I don't know if this is the first expansion for Nobunaga.
3641083	3646706	I know they have Nobunaga's, like they turned Nobunaga's Ambition into like an online game now.
3646786	3649427	So I'm not sure if this is the online game itself.
3649487	3652129	I thought that had already come out or if this is like the first expansion.
3652789	3655430	But that is coming out in Japan on the 22nd.
3655530	3659511	Unfortunately, the description is in Japanese, so I can't read if that's a regular one or expansion.
3660291	3668413	Also coming out on the 23rd of December, Mugen Kairo Hikari to Kage no Hako comes out as well in Japan.
3669113	3672894	And this looks like... Oh, it's Echo Chrome 2.
3673414	3674554	That's what this game is.
3674634	3676175	It looks like Echo Chrome, but with colors.
3676235	3677435	And sure enough, it is Echo Chrome 2.
3678055	3679075	Not a download title.
3679135	3680296	That is actually going to be out there.
3680336	3681536	It supports the PlayStation Move.
3682967	3684588	That is coming out on the 23rd.
3686070	3691614	Going to the Wii in Japan.
3691954	3697839	Momochan Diet Wii Figurobics by Chon Dayon comes out this week on the 23rd.
3698520	3700321	Yeah, it's another diet game, but get this.
3700722	3702583	You have to see the box art for this game.
3702964	3707587	I'm just going to copy that little picture, and I'm going to post that in our chat room.
3708388	3711990	And you kids tell me if you're going to buy that fitness game based on the artwork or not.
3712051	3712891	Loki, what do you think?
3713411	3718595	What does this fitness game have in the box art that most fitness games don't usually have?
3719556	3720796	Hot Asian chick on the front?
3720876	3721397	That's right.
3721497	3722878	In a bikini, nonetheless.
3723498	3728542	And she's not only in a bikini, she's kind of peeling down the bottom of her bikini.
3728582	3728822	Look at that.
3728842	3729422	Yeah, you know what?
3729642	3730243	What a hoe.
3730383	3733285	Jillian Michaels tried that on the cover of her game, and I'm sorry.
3733445	3734365	Not the same effect.
3735286	3735946	It's not the same.
3735966	3737347	It's like, no, I don't want to see your penis.
3741690	3744371	It is not the same.
3746052	3749954	Also, Milestone Shooting Collection 2 comes out on the Wii, but who cares?
3749974	3753416	You're all going to be looking at your unopened boxes of Momochan Diet.
3755337	3758739	On the DS, not a lot this week.
3758779	3759819	There really isn't anything.
3760139	3765682	But we do get to Saga 3, Jikunohasha, Shadow or Light comes out on January 6th.
3767123	3775127	I believe this is another game in the Saga series, like it's a remake of one of the Saga games, which was what, Final Fantasy Legend here?
3775827	3776528	So that's kind of cool.
3778248	3787773	Lastly, going to the PSP, Beyond the Milky Way comes out this week on the PSP, as well as Starry Sky in Autumn, and a big release this week, The Third Birthday.
3788193	3793636	If that doesn't sound familiar to you, that's the new Parasite Eve game coming on PSP, The Third Birthday this week, so...
3794016	3794536	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3820661	3822402	I'll go ahead and mention the 31st.
3822842	3826683	We have EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis because kids like tennis.
3827823	3828323	And that's it.
3830024	3830384	All right.
3830564	3832804	That's going to do it for the release dates this week.
3832864	3836585	Let's go back into some news and we have the classic game of the week just a few minutes ahead of us.
3836725	3837946	But first, a story from Loki.
3838666	3838866	Yes.
3840146	3840686	Let's see.
3840806	3841627	This is kind of neat.
3844125	3853650	Now, you may remember that they just released the pretty awesome Infinity Blade on the iPhone and iOS App Store.
3854570	3860713	Well, there's going to be other games supporting the Unreal Development Kit, and it's kind of cool.
3861534	3867117	One of the demos that they were showing off the Unreal Development Kit for was...
3867837	3873421	None other than the long, hopefully not forgotten, epic game, Jazz the Jackrabbit.
3874342	3880106	But now updated in 3D graphics and fun stuff like that.
3880867	3887252	There's actually some other epic, well, other Unreal Engine games that are coming to the store.
3887272	3894898	In fact, I think there's actually one, and I don't remember what it was called, but it kind of looked a little bit like World of Warcraft.
3895898	3907428	on um but it was like a tower defense game or something like that or like a hack and slash game with the name dungeon and the title I don't remember exactly what it was but uh it looked pretty cool so um
3909144	3926332	But yeah, I mean, more games supporting the Unreal Engine would be pretty awesome because they can do some pretty sweet looking stuff just even with the limited resources of the iOS and the iPhones and stuff like that.
3926392	3930354	Just like when I hear that there might be a new Jazz Jackrabbit or whatever, I'm like, oh my God, is it 1994?
3930394	3930674	This is great.
3932777	3933037	Yeah.
3934078	3934638	That's awesome.
3935879	3940121	Something else that is new and exciting, I guess, depends what kind of games you play.
3940622	3941422	SingStar.
3941862	3943964	Yeah, remember SingStar, the karaoke game?
3944484	3945625	It's also a dance game now.
3945865	3946725	I played your ABBA.
3947105	3947686	Yeah, SingStar.
3948286	3948867	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3973746	3974527	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3995885	3998407	I'm trying to see if there's any really, really big songs in here.
3998447	4000408	There's a shit ton of Lady Gaga songs.
4000828	4004151	So if you're into Lady Gaga, there's quite a few songs from her first album that are there.
4004551	4007573	And Bad Romance, because you know you want to make your friends sing Bad Romance.
4008454	4010375	Songs from the Jackson 5 are now there.
4011195	4011856	Take That.
4013657	4017099	That's an old school band that I think is getting back together.
4017760	4022203	Did you know that the New Kids on the Block and the Backstreet Boys are going out on tour together?
4022503	4024664	Yes, and I actually did see that performance.
4024884	4026964	Speaking of it being the 90s all over again.
4029805	4031325	Somebody asked me if I wanted to go.
4031505	4032605	I'm like, no, I don't.
4033285	4033406	No.
4033466	4034326	Like, no, I'm not.
4034926	4035046	No.
4036686	4042668	But you can do some dancing to Tiffany, I Think We're Alone Now and Aha!
4042728	4043328	Take On Me.
4043408	4045448	I'm sorry, I still like the Birthday Massacre version better.
4046188	4046488	Whatever.
4046929	4048589	There it is, some SingStar stuff for you.
4048922	4058387	Hey, let's go to the classics video games and talk about an old school game that DarkSakura thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing this week.
4058867	4061208	It's the classic video game of the week.
4061588	4067891	DarkSakura's gonna step into the vault, find a game that she says, hey, you got two weeks because of the holiday.
4068431	4069372	Play this game.
4069572	4069912	Damn it.
4070593	4071473	What's the classic game of the week?
4071992	4074233	I can tell you people are going to have a hard time finding this one.
4075353	4076333	Space Fantasy Zone.
4077874	4079274	Space Fantasy Zone.
4079634	4079934	Yes.
4080034	4082455	Not Fantasy Zone, but Space Fantasy Zone.
4082675	4089177	Basically what this game is is that it is a mix of Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone.
4090635	4094699	and even the music is a little remix of the themes.
4096742	4100025	It actually, with the particular game, it never came out.
4101226	4102027	It was never released.
4102047	4102888	This is a prototype.
4103889	4106992	Oh, wait a minute.
4107453	4113339	However, you actually can find the disc image online.
4114187	4118551	Aha, so the kiddies are going to have to resort to more scandalous means to play this game.
4118671	4125377	I wouldn't necessarily say it's scandalous, given that, you know, I don't really think there's any kind of restriction on it.
4126999	4130061	But it is really pretty.
4130462	4134225	It's still got the same kind of Space Harrier scaling issues.
4134405	4136107	It's pretty minimalist, but...
4137879	4144102	The other thing that actually I didn't really care for in it, too, is that it is a little bit harder to hit stuff, but it's still so freaking cute.
4144242	4147223	I mean, because the game Space Harrier is set in the Fantasy Zone.
4147584	4149324	You know, welcome to Fantasy Zone, get ready.
4150125	4152666	So it takes two of the best things and just puts them together.
4152786	4159469	And, you know, your bosses are some of your classic Fantasy Zone bosses.
4160249	4162550	It's just really neat, and it's cute.
4163531	4163631	Um...
4166050	4171657	It really is just, it's something for people who love Space Harrier or Fantasy Zone.
4171677	4173159	I mean, that's really all that it is.
4175047	4176048	It's eye candy.
4176268	4180191	Oh, and you can go into your little shops and buy stuff.
4180231	4187097	You've got the same lady from the shops in Fantasy Zone and get all kinds of goodies.
4187357	4188438	It's just cute.
4188538	4190280	I mean, that's really all I can say about it.
4191421	4196225	And it's got the Opa Opa and his little feet sticking out going, I'm the Opa Opa.
4197813	4198153	DarkSakura.com
4215424	4216205	I have to throw the two together.
4232393	4243121	But, you know, oddly enough, I wouldn't exactly... I don't really classify Space Fantasy Zone on some... You see, the other reason why I'm bringing it up for the classic game is that it is... You can play the whole thing.
4243221	4243761	It's fun.
4243981	4246023	It's, you know, a nice waste of time.
4246863	4252867	Not... There usually are a few issues with the disc, too, and burning, so you have to be really careful when you do it.
4253668	4256390	But... Like, see, there's the wood face thing.
4256590	4262051	Yeah, I like how the bosses in this game kind of look like the bosses from the original Fantasy Zone.
4262071	4262991	No, they are the bosses.
4263932	4264532	You know what I mean, though.
4264552	4266092	They're in that whole 3D environment.
4266772	4267452	So, kind of neat.
4267652	4270453	So I really had to just throw it out there.
4270733	4279135	You know, it's a game that I think any fan of Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier should at least give a look at.
4279474	4282017	Now, there's some listeners that aren't going to know, so I have to ask.
4282057	4286321	You just said your second favorite game ever is Fantasy Zone and your third favorite ever is Space Harrier.
4286802	4287582	What's number one?
4288443	4289685	That would be Guardian Legend.
4290325	4291286	Amen, sister.
4291627	4293689	Guardian Legend, most underrated NES game ever.
4294109	4295030	The game is so great.
4295050	4295591	It's great.
4296311	4297232	Absolutely astounding.
4297593	4300796	Not as good any of those games as Super Metroid, but they're all still really good.
4301751	4303091	Well, that's your favorite game.
4303411	4303731	I know.
4304071	4316134	But, I mean, so really, I know it's not an official released game, and yeah, I've got a few prototypes of other stuff, but this is one prototype that you can get the full version of out there.
4316214	4318234	It's not unavailable.
4318294	4322695	Now, you can't find an official printing of it or something without spending the bucks.
4322935	4323115	Right.
4323695	4327396	But still, and I don't think there's any real reason about why it wasn't released.
4327436	4329216	It might have been something about licensing issues.
4329296	4329496	Mm-hmm.
4332729	4333390	It's just fun.
4333790	4336193	It's not even really the greatest game ever.
4336954	4340138	But it is something that's worth playing.
4340398	4341720	It's something that's worth checking out.
4342461	4344884	And at least, you know, watch the video.
4344944	4345484	It's cute.
4346646	4349910	And I still love the PC Engine.
4351374	4354456	Well, that's going to do it for Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4354476	4355336	But don't go anywhere, guys.
4355356	4357537	There's plenty more to come in Part B tonight.
4357598	4360079	Your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
4360099	4362940	Your Twitters at twitter.com slash OLR.
4363000	4363841	Be sure to get those in.
4364341	4375447	And, of course, your phone calls will be coming up later in the program, as well as some rapid-fire news, some really quick news stories of what's going on, and some other game-related news stories, including one about sex.
4376008	4379690	So you better stay tuned for more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4380470	4380610	What?
4380630	4381431	I have a mic off.
4382833	4383834	Let's talk about sex.
4384174	4385195	It's a George Michael song.
4386116	4386917	Okay.
4387017	4388778	I thought that that was Salt-N-Pepa.
4389139	4389819	It was Salt-N-Pepa.
4389840	4390440	Oh, whatever.
4390820	4393423	They both had songs about sex, among many others.
4393763	4399169	Actually, George Michael was the one that got busted for, well, it wasn't really sex, but you know what?
4399189	4400390	We're just going to go to break.
4400410	4403193	We'll be back in a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4409226	4411568	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4411608	4418794	We are live on this Sunday evening, December the 19th of 2010 with the 394th episode of our show.
4418834	4424679	We are taping live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com if you've ever wanted to join us for a live show.
4425000	4429464	Tune in at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
4430024	4432026	But not next week because we won't be here next week.
4432066	4435209	But tune in in early January when we will be back.
4436189	4438670	Over the break, we were playing some music from Space Invaders.
4439210	4442151	Sorry, we can't play it on the podcast because it's copyright.
4442431	4445711	But, Loki, you were saying something about the whole Space Invaders on the App Store.
4445751	4446652	You were not a fan, right?
4446772	4448432	No, Infinity Gene is terrible.
4449292	4449852	It's okay.
4449972	4450853	I played it.
4450973	4451513	It's okay.
4451613	4453073	But, yeah, I kind of agree.
4453133	4455614	It's not nearly as good as Extreme.
4455914	4458654	When you play Extreme, it's just awesome.
4458734	4463096	But Infinity Gene was just, no, not cool.
4463836	4464896	It's awesome.
4465356	4468339	Now, during the break, I also got a present from Loki.
4468379	4469120	So thank you, Loki.
4469160	4470582	He bought me something on the App Store.
4471203	4472844	Dungeon Raider 2.
4473065	4474026	No, Dungeon Hunter 2.
4474146	4475667	Yes, it's very much like Diablo.
4476508	4476749	Awesome.
4477029	4477690	Oh, awesome.
4477710	4478771	You know I love me some Diablo.
4478871	4479432	So great.
4479512	4479832	Yay.
4479852	4482355	And Jamie has something coming her way, too.
4482595	4482995	Woo-hoo.
4483556	4508726	presence in studio good times speaking of presence we should actually let the I gave you guys your presence before the show uh-huh oh yes I forgot we didn't talk about those on air yeah DarkSakura got me a World of Warcraft trivia calendar because she knows I'm an addict and so now I have a little desk calendar for work that I can tear off each day and then like I can mark things a little post-it notes like e3 and some of the big events during the years I can see how long it is till e3
4509306	4512488	When I was working, I actually had three different calendars like that on my desk.
4512948	4516790	I had the Redneck Dictionary, which I just thought was funny.
4517410	4520352	And then I had the Yiddish Word of the Day.
4521472	4528216	And then I had another one that was, oh yeah, like random facts that they won't tell you about or something.
4528236	4528896	So it was pretty cool.
4529577	4532118	But I got Loki Family Guy Calendar.
4533396	4534437	Yes, thank you.
4534717	4538961	I'm definitely going to put this up on my desk because all I have is... What was it?
4539081	4541603	Axis Game Localization gave me a calendar.
4542064	4544165	And it's tiny.
4544486	4545667	And not Family Guy.
4545887	4549390	Because this has quotes on it that I can actually put on my marquee.
4550771	4551311	DarkSakura.com
4573126	4578107	DarkSakura, you do a show as well, and you're running some year-end specials right now, right?
4598752	4601934	Yes, we do one called Comic Insanity.
4602075	4603416	It's on Infamous.net.
4603476	4610140	That's with no I in front of the N. And it's me and Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.
4610281	4612922	And we talk about comics.
4614263	4634779	and we talk about Shadow's hatred of Hulk people and the love-hate relationship of Marvel and Matt Fraction who's writing Iron Man and my cluelessness about just about anything DC Comics related.
4636220	4636460	So.
4637280	4637601	All right.
4637661	4642284	So if you want links to those, both those shows now available at OrangeLawnRadio.com right on the left-hand side.
4642324	4643405	Little links to both those shows.
4643825	4643925	Yeah.
4643945	4644346	How cute.
4644986	4645466	So awesome.
4646227	4648509	And remember, don't mention Jeff Loeb.
4649548	4650869	Also, I want to mention this.
4651029	4652770	It's on orangelaunchradio.com.
4652790	4660834	You may have to go into the archive a little bit to see this, but our buddies over at Under Sedation Live are doing their annual Madness tournament.
4660994	4662054	It was March Madness.
4662154	4664916	Now it's just Madness, I think, because it doesn't have a month.
4664976	4668498	It's USLOLR Madness version 2011.
4669718	4675261	You should submit your top 25 lists to uslmadness at gmail.com.
4675281	4676562	That is the top 25 games listed.
4677643	4678204	Ever!
4678964	4685029	Like, if you are a huge fan of Super Metroid, I'm gonna send my number one to Super Metroid to uslmadness at gmail.com.
4685309	4695297	Or you already know, DarkSakura's list is gonna be one, Guardian Legend, two, I'm writing her damn list for her, Fantasy Zone, three, Space Harrier, and continue on through 25.
4696458	4702364	So the nominees to get the most points will be entered into an elimination 64 bracket.
4702805	4704546	uslmadness at gmail.com.
4704566	4706188	More information available on our website.
4706468	4708110	You have to scroll back in the news a little bit.
4708510	4709731	So there it is.
4711353	4711613	Awesome.
4713075	4715357	All that information at orangelaunchradio.com, of course.
4716138	4718019	And Tigerclaw is letting us know that...
4720154	4722276	Oh, sorry, I thought that was about rebroadcast.
4722296	4724377	That's something else I'll have to chat with him offline about.
4724898	4734465	Anyhow, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick news, some stories that we just don't have the full time to talk about, but we wanted to bring them to your attention nonetheless, Loki.
4735345	4735565	Yes.
4737126	4737846	So this is neat.
4738226	4743709	Super Meat Boy, a game we've actually been talking about on the show for a few weeks now and is very awesome.
4744149	4751933	If you happen to have the PC version, apparently they figured out a way to uncover the dev mode located in the game.
4752493	4755175	And of course it was discovered by the modding community.
4756055	4761418	And I believe it allows you to customize your game a little bit.
4762858	4785791	and of course this is only in the PC version it gives you the keys to the kingdom as they put it and some very user friendly tools in which Team Meat created the game with including the original batch of levels and actually it was kind of cool Team Meat the creators of the game were actually nice enough to post a few tutorial videos explaining how to access and use the tools
4787252	4788633	Thank you for watching!
4808851	4827041	and of course if you're a fan of Dead Rising 2 you'll be happy to know that on December 27th Dead Rising 2 Case West will be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade it's the exclusive epilogue to the game and will cost you 800 Microsoft points or $10 do want
4829722	4831002	So that looks pretty awesome.
4831362	4838284	And of course, they're also going to have the photo part of the game coming back as well for that.
4839804	4841564	Nice little after Christmas gift there.
4842684	4847445	And then finally, Section 8, which was a first-person shooter, came out last August.
4849326	4850566	Or I should say August 2009.
4851506	4856447	That actually did okay at retail and was a full-price game when it came out.
4856887	4858408	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4877163	4886305	and it's going to also include a single player campaign, support for up to 32 players in online multiplayer and a new four player co-op mode called Swarm.
4887025	4899488	It says offline players will also be able to partake in multiplayer as the game can add bots in case you don't have friends or an internet connection to play against.
4903757	4904838	Hamlet, The Game
4930041	4930602	Yes, that's right.
4930662	4932444	And Hamlet's taking out the trash.
4932585	4934147	Only it's not real.
4935208	4936149	Is that Hamlet 2?
4936530	4938212	No, that was from Last Action Hero.
4938753	4940495	To be or not to be?
4940635	4941416	Not to be.
4941937	4943459	Have you seen Hamlet 2?
4943719	4943920	No.
4944040	4945602	It's the dumbest fucking movie.
4946042	4946863	Is there still kids here?
4948265	4949726	I'm hoping not because the door is wide open.
4950146	4951287	Are there still kids here?
4951507	4951867	Can I swear?
4951887	4952388	I don't think so.
4952428	4952808	Okay, good.
4953008	4954690	It's the dumbest fucking movie ever made.
4955630	4957872	But it's so dumb, it's kind of funny.
4958132	4959093	So anyway, that was Hamlet 2.
4959393	4962455	But this actually is not really what you would think it is.
4962576	4964337	In fact, there's this whole little trailer out there for the game.
4964817	4966757	It's very stylized.
4966797	4967718	I like that style.
4967798	4972679	It's kind of like that limbo-esque thing going on there.
4973599	4975219	Yeah, it's all coming out January 2011.
4976319	4977700	I'm playing the trailer here in studio.
4978680	4979680	It's an adventure game.
4980720	4984341	This does not look like Hamlet to play to me.
4986281	4988482	But it is based on Shakespeare's Hamlet.
4989282	4990682	So I have no idea how that works.
4991565	4993806	See, now we need the sassy gay friend to show up.
4995787	4996448	What are you doing?
4996748	4997068	What?
4997088	4997268	What?
4997328	4998028	What are you doing?
4998368	4998969	I know, right?
4999709	5005072	Apparently, the rest of the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 roster has been revealed.
5005552	5006933	It's been spoiled.
5007373	5010034	That is, if you believe the dirty internet rumors.
5010555	5012215	Sienko from Darkstalkers.
5012456	5013016	Sweet.
5013336	5014637	Akuma from Street Fighter.
5015257	5016598	Hager from Final Fight.
5016718	5017058	Really?
5017078	5017198	Really.
5017438	5018899	Yes, that's awesome actually.
5019459	5030002	Phoenix, the X-Men, Sentinel from the X-Men, Taskmaster, Avengers-ish, Galactus is the final boss in the Fantastic Four.
5030202	5032043	Taskmaster would be interesting.
5032523	5033943	So, there you go.
5034063	5037244	Apparently some other characters that were planned for the game, but they didn't make it.
5037784	5045366	Phoenix Wright, Mega Man, Venom, and Frank West were all planned for the game, but it just didn't happen.
5046146	5048107	I'm kind of sad that Frank West won't show up.
5048147	5049027	That's kind of surprising.
5049047	5051148	But then again, he's not the central character in the new game.
5051528	5052788	So, I don't know.
5053228	5057349	It would have been an easy port since, you know, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom had him.
5057789	5058670	You would think, right?
5058990	5059810	Taskmaster...
5061771	5070599	Taskmaster actually makes sense because he was a regular in the older Deadpool comic for a while.
5070990	5071330	All right.
5071991	5086047	Well, hey, if you like RPGs and you own a PSP, and when I say RPGs, I mean old school RPGs, then seriously, there is an awesome, incredible must-have game that was announced for the PSP this week.
5086167	5087468	It's going to be so awesome.
5087508	5088269	I can't wait.
5088570	5089771	Get the dust off the PSP.
5090352	5090852	Break them out.
5091873	5113026	Squenix has announced that they are bringing Final Fantasy 4 to the PSP and this is not the 3D version that was on the DS but it's being redone in 2D with the graphics in HD a la the Final Fantasy 1 and 2 remakes but here's the thing it's not just Final Fantasy 4 it's
5113866	5117089	It's also the After Years on one disc.
5117409	5123775	That was the mobile game that came out on WiiWare, and that is also being upgraded to the new treatment, so that is awesome.
5124456	5129441	Final Fantasy IV Complete Collection for the PSP was revealed by VJump Magazine in Japan this week.
5129761	5135907	Keep in mind, this has only officially been announced for Japan, but I can't see how this game isn't coming out over here.
5135947	5138289	I mean, this is just, oh man, this is just awesome.
5138910	5139972	So, there it is.
5140032	5141815	It's coming out in Japan this spring.
5142276	5144361	Probably the U.S., eh, what, summer?
5144561	5145222	Next holiday?
5145944	5146765	Not soon enough.
5147507	5147988	There it is.
5148028	5148990	That's the news I got.
5150011	5151111	Final Fantasy Tactics The War on the Lions
5174161	5175942	They were plugging that at E3 this year.
5175962	5177382	That's sure taking them a while to get out.
5177482	5180204	I wonder what's going on with it, but it looks cute.
5180344	5181604	Take the time to get it right.
5181644	5182725	Don't release something buggy.
5182765	5183525	That's fine by me.
5183965	5184345	Agreed.
5185146	5191829	And also, and this should make people pretty happy, is that there's new Rock Band download content for Christmas.
5192069	5198271	It actually is Happy Christmas Wars Over, which is John Lennon and Yoko Ono.
5198792	5199412	That's pretty cool.
5200092	5208376	and then Poutatre en Angine, I think, by Anais and Dix-Moi by B.B.
5208416	5212178	Bruns and Verdamp Langhaire, which is by B.A.P.
5213939	5225184	Nurenwort by Worsen Helden, Phantasma by Linnea, Proibito by Litfilba, I don't know who they are, Jerk It Out by Caesars.
5225486	5227808	There's a lot of worldly music this week, it sounds like.
5228148	5228368	Yeah.
5228809	5229149	Neat.
5229549	5231051	The only one I care about is the first one.
5231511	5235334	There's been a lot of John Lennon love in Rock Band 3, because he released one of his albums, too.
5235394	5238757	There was also, well, all the Beatles stuff got released, too.
5238997	5240819	Well, sure, of course, there was the Beatles game.
5240859	5242240	But there was the anniversary.
5243941	5247104	Ah, that's right, there was a re-release album, that's right.
5247464	5247624	Yeah.
5248225	5248645	Very cool.
5250246	5250507	What else?
5251207	5252168	Dreamcast!
5254171	5258076	There's actually been a confirmation of a Dreamcast collection.
5258156	5259538	GameStop has a listing for it.
5259978	5261000	Supposedly out of Feptember.
5261260	5263463	Feptember.
5263483	5264344	Why am I saying Feptember?
5264985	5265886	February.
5267287	5268609	That sounds like a holiday month.
5268689	5269350	Faptember.
5270686	5272687	February 15th for $30.
5275029	5280292	But there's really not a whole lot saying just that there is something by the Sega marketing VP.
5280772	5285535	Alan Pritchard says, and this is a quote, we actually have a Dreamcast collection coming out soon.
5287156	5287916	How descriptive.
5288396	5289537	Yeah, that's nothing.
5289717	5292899	PSO or GTFO, right?
5293579	5293879	Right.
5295280	5296181	But I'll take Space Channel 5.
5296869	5312349	Space Channel 5 I like just how completely emotionless she says it in the Japanese version whereas you got Apollo Smile who was the most annoying person in the universe being all fabulous and everything in the US one and then the Japanese one you have Space Channel 5
5316074	5319519	By the way, I just have to point this out in our chat room at chat.orangesauntradio.com.
5319759	5322182	Bochikawa says, Faptember sounds good.
5322262	5323223	Let's make it now.
5323604	5325566	So Frisbee says, Jerkuary.
5325586	5327529	I was trying to say Feptember.
5328971	5329611	Faptember.
5331053	5332075	Rob's dirty.
5335230	5337512	You know it wouldn't be hard to get people to participate.
5337572	5338212	I mean, you have what?
5338552	5340734	You have NaNoWriMo, right?
5340774	5342655	The writing month where everybody's supposed to write a novel.
5342695	5345477	I mean, how many people can actually write the whole damn novel, right?
5346097	5349059	November, where you're supposed to be growing out a beard through the entire month.
5349639	5353122	But I think Faptember is something everybody can participate in.
5353682	5354282	You know what I mean?
5355863	5356604	Come on, DarkSakura.
5356624	5358225	We should start making banners and buttons.
5358485	5361007	I'm still trying to find Deadpool on a moped.
5362307	5363168	Okay, you have fun with that.
5363533	5367535	All right, we're going to go to the Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
5368176	5368816	You know what's funny?
5368956	5371218	I haven't even like pulled up the Twitter at all yet.
5371878	5372799	I'm going to link it in the chat room.
5372939	5374440	What are you linking?
5375560	5382564	It's a picture of Deadpool with Taskmaster on a moped that's supposed to, it's done up like the bike from Nakira.
5384005	5388768	I like all the, suddenly we are getting all these unsolicited names from, you know, Fat Timber.
5388808	5390909	We have Sex Timber and Cocktober.
5390929	5391890	Yeah.
5392350	5396335	and Jessica Harper is quick to point out, women don't fap, we squick.
5399037	5400419	I didn't know that was the term for it.
5400759	5403462	I've learned something new on this episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
5403562	5403963	Squick.
5404724	5405665	I thought it was click.
5406425	5408267	I just, I always heard like clicking the mouse.
5408488	5409228	So what, we have Pokuary?
5409248	5409349	What?
5413673	5413973	Alright.
5415074	5419078	Ah, we're getting all this bullshit spam coming from somebody.
5419098	5423663	I gotta block this user real quick because I seriously can't read our Twitter because it's so bad.
5426365	5427466	I hate spammers on Twitter.
5427486	5428507	They all need to die in a fire.
5428547	5429128	Don't you think so?
5431524	5432945	How about a boat fire?
5433765	5434446	Seriously.
5434946	5435907	Alright, let's try this again.
5437007	5438809	Read Twitter and filter that guy out.
5438849	5439689	Yay, much better.
5440209	5442011	Wow, there's like no tweets tonight.
5442071	5442791	What is up with this?
5442851	5444432	Alright, well Spazinator sent us one.
5445433	5448335	There's two free vids on PlayStation Network again.
5448415	5449616	Oh good, we like free vids.
5449796	5452037	We're getting the free vid update from Spazinator.
5452618	5454279	There's two free vids on PSN again.
5454359	5459943	The pilot to a new-ish anime series and a promo for Robot Chicken Star Wars 3.
5461284	5462124	Oh, free promo.
5463985	5468549	Spazinator also wants to know, is WoW cataclysm Shermie approved?
5469389	5470310	MolesJK.
5470970	5474593	Has, I don't know, has Shermie voiced an opinion on cataclysm?
5474773	5481678	No, but our overseas friend Rob sent me a card that says Merry fucking Christmas on it.
5482419	5482999	I love that card.
5483299	5484260	And he said because of Shermie.
5485487	5486567	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5503522	5506843	I don't remember hearing about this, although I thought I also did.
5506903	5507443	I don't remember.
5507503	5508624	But anyway, we'll read it anyway.
5528690	5551765	and you got to be one of the top 32 virtual racers in the US if you are one of the top 32 you will compete in March 2011 to be one of 16 finalists and then you get to drive real Nissan racers that's according to the announcement the final winner will get to join the GT Academy they will train with professional drivers at tracks around the world and join a professional racing team
5552285	5554608	and I guess it's all going to be televised like a reality show.
5555009	5561819	So if you've ever wanted to be on a reality show and you're, I don't know, you're good at Gran Turismo 5 then go for it!
5562980	5563401	Should be fun.
5564997	5565537	Twitter.com slash OLR
5592232	5594955	And that's pretty good for being a $6 game.
5595495	5599339	They sold it over 286,000 times.
5600420	5606086	And it's the fastest grossing app ever, according to the website Appmodo.
5608107	5609108	Wow.
5609209	5614093	The old record, I guess, was held by Cut the Rope, which was $1 million in 10 days.
5615652	5617792	I didn't realize Cut the Rope had caught on so quickly.
5617812	5620973	I've heard of Cut the Rope, but I've never played it, though.
5621293	5625914	But I thought it was one of those games that kind of slowly grew in popularity.
5625934	5627995	And actually, I'm standing corrected.
5628015	5637177	Apparently, Epic Mark Rain, he said that the Game Center numbers that are being reported are quite a bit lower than the actual sales, so more than 1.7 million.
5638317	5663830	hmm um says uh the says i tweeted because i thought that it'd be obvious that the game center numbers are a subset of our overall sales and not the actual number but several of the reports i saw seem to be confused about that also infinity blade does not require a game center you can choose to cancel and still play the game however i recommend signing up for game center apple has done a great job it's
5664230	5665190	Yeah, right.
5665270	5666831	I'm sorry, that's where I lost him right there.
5667371	5672712	Hey, did you hear, speaking of like failed Apple launches, did you hear Ping got some new additions in the last week?
5672772	5673332	Remember Ping?
5673372	5673572	Huh?
5673692	5673772	What?
5673792	5674593	Do you know what Ping is?
5674873	5675753	No.
5675813	5677333	First off, whatever happened to Pooping?
5677533	5681074	There was that website one of our listeners made, the Pooping site.
5681434	5687756	But anyway, no, Ping has now, you can share playlists with your friends.
5688456	5693037	You can share playlists of songs that you know you could go and then buy on iTunes.
5694732	5698035	Hey, it's finally a feature of ping that Twitter doesn't have.
5698935	5700436	However insignificant it may be.
5702678	5703258	So there you go.
5703859	5704639	Other fun stuff.
5705460	5707641	Infinity Blade is getting an update next week.
5709243	5716628	They're going to be adding some new enemies to face because from what I heard there's only like six that you face each time you play through the game.
5718609	5722212	And they're also going to be adding multiplayer soon.
5723584	5723904	Marrow Fiend
5742577	5744919	And that's screenshots from a frickin' iPhone?
5745119	5745499	Yes, it is.
5745520	5746180	That looks outstanding.
5746200	5746921	Have you played the game yet?
5747021	5747481	I have not.
5748122	5749002	I will have to show it to you.
5749543	5750123	At some point.
5750564	5751905	We're not trying to do a radio show, absolutely.
5751925	5752746	Well, I meant later on.
5752786	5753426	I know, I know, I know.
5754667	5756829	During our music break after the show.
5757189	5757830	Alright, sounds good.
5758731	5760052	Let's talk about sex!
5762648	5768852	Now that I have your attention, let's talk about this new thing that's on the thingy, that's on the Kinect.
5769672	5770673	Yeah, here's the deal.
5771413	5780539	We were talking earlier about Kinect hacks and, you know, people can play the piano and people can do, you know, whatever, these 3D dancing and all these sorts of things that Kinect.
5780899	5783140	Well, it didn't take long for somebody to think of sex.
5783780	5786602	And it's from Thrix with three X's.
5786682	5787663	That's Thrixx.
5788183	5789404	and Thrixx.
5809259	5814701	The Kinect hardware is used, plus some of the open drivers in Windows 7 is how it works.
5815761	5822723	Unfortunately, I would play the video for you, but it was removed from YouTube because some people reported it for nudity and sexual content.
5823143	5823843	Boo!
5823984	5824964	Ruining all our fun.
5825064	5825444	Boo!
5825464	5833346	It's just like all the other sex games that they have out there, like all the anime ones and stuff where you use the mouse and stuff, but instead of using the mouse, you use your hand.
5833486	5835387	It's honestly not that exciting, people.
5836127	5836667	It is not.
5838208	5839588	It's pretty much exactly what we said.
5839948	5845670	You rub this magical floaty hand over boobs and the chick goes, you know, ooh, boobs.
5846370	5849791	Anyway, you might be wondering when this is coming out for the Xbox 360.
5851131	5851432	Really?
5851532	5852532	You're really wondering that?
5853192	5856974	Here's the thing, Microsoft has pretty much said, hell no.
5857794	5860115	In an interview with IGN, they said, Hold on, hold on.
5860135	5860795	Stop right there.
5873186	5873486	Really?
5874147	5874607	IGN?
5874747	5875007	Really?
5875127	5875988	You went and asked them?
5876268	5881871	Like it wasn't completely obvious to begin with that this was A. First off, never going to come out on a console.
5882172	5883933	B. It was just a PC game anyways.
5884153	5886554	And C. It wasn't that interesting of an idea.
5886934	5892258	But no, you had the spare time to go ask them this so you can get a comment so that you can get some more page hits.
5892978	5893539	Good job!
5893899	5899744	I agree, but at the same time... Maybe you should dedicate a podcast to that too, because they have like 80,000 podcasts.
5900244	5908671	It's kind of bullshit, because, you know, and I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but if somebody really wants to waste $60 on this, then you know what?
5908851	5909192	Let them.
5909792	5910072	You know?
5911774	5915256	How is this any worse than some of the Bang Bang Shoot'em Up games that are out there?
5915296	5918058	Like, I don't know, Mafia 2 that was brought up earlier in the show.
5918758	5921320	I'm so sick of this double standard of sex versus violence.
5921340	5929485	There is a double standard, and I bet you anything that this will come out in Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball 3 where you can tickle them.
5929926	5931567	Yes, it's just tickling.
5932587	5934609	And it's just a giant feather that's in your hand.
5934669	5938932	It's not actually your hand, but it's a giant feather, and you can go tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, and they'll go hee, hee, hee.
5939112	5940132	And their boobs will move, yeah.
5941113	5942574	But that'll be okay.
5942654	5943494	That'll be alright.
5943674	5946936	DarkSakura, would you play Dead or Alive if it had booby-tickling connect mode?
5947596	5947816	Yes.
5952658	5954159	You should be able to unlock things.
5954279	5957941	I think that they should have the dudes in the game.
5958701	5959421	Okay, this is the thing.
5959722	5961402	Boobs are a lot more fun than junk.
5963583	5964724	Like, for bounciness.
5967305	5969246	Okay, I'm with you on that.
5969978	5975260	So, you know, there's people going, why don't they have one with dudes and speedos and everything?
5975360	5980662	I'm surprised they don't have, like, a beach, you know, beachwear mode in, like, Dead or Alive, you know?
5980722	5982683	Wasn't there the whole volleyball game or whatever?
5982703	5983903	Yeah, that was the volleyball.
5984303	5986424	But I'm talking about, like, actual fighting, you know?
5988725	5991507	I don't know how I feel about this at chat.orangelandrena.com.
5991887	5997271	Long Sagat, I don't know, in our chat room says, poop should be cool in video games.
5997872	6000013	No, I don't think that's ever really cool.
6000073	6007219	Like some things, you know, again, if that's what somebody really wants to pay 60 bucks on is poop the game, then you know what?
6007839	6008199	Have fun.
6008219	6009781	Go play Conker's Bad Fur Day.
6009821	6012543	But I mean, you can poop for free like every day.
6012643	6014264	Just eat more fiber, you know?
6014684	6016346	But tickling chicks with feathers, that's...
6016906	6018227	Don't Shit Your Pants
6039952	6062184	anything is possible on the PC and that's why folks PC gaming will never cease to exist and you think that poop is not in games yet or at least not enough in games just wait Duke Nukem Forever hasn't come out yet so I'm sure there will be plenty of poop in that I love this oh my god this is the best comment ever and I can't pronounce this name
6062884	6070328	Kasson, Khan with an S, says to Long Sagat about his whole poop thing, fiber, uppercut.
6074069	6074470	You win.
6074710	6075150	You win.
6075970	6077331	Chatter of the evening right there.
6077391	6078251	Sound the bells and whistles.
6079372	6080793	Dude whose name I can't pronounce.
6082113	6084134	Congrats.
6084214	6085015	Fiber, uppercut.
6085055	6085355	You win.
6091983	6092444	All righty.
6092884	6093964	Only on Orange Lounge Radio.
6095045	6098186	Maybe we could get away from the sex topic for a minute here, DarkSakura.
6098226	6100007	Do you have something maybe a little more legitimate for us?
6101348	6102228	Shadow the Hedgehog.
6102649	6103069	Barf!
6103729	6104449	Barf, barf, barf.
6104990	6105350	Seriously?
6105370	6105690	Yeah.
6105890	6106691	Well, basically...
6108131	6113375	Sega wanted to talk about why we got Shadow the Hedgehog.
6114316	6116518	They thought it would work for US gamers.
6118139	6126546	The producer of Sonic Colors, Takashi Izuka, said, "...after Sonic Adventure, we had two studios, one in the US, one in Japan."
6127406	6134452	"...and to continue the quote, the Japanese studio was to develop a Sonic game in the standard style, and the US was to develop something different which could contribute to the Sonic franchise."
6135272	6139555	So basically, he was made to work in the U.S.
6139775	6143657	because first and third person shooters were popular and they wanted someone who could work with it.
6144197	6146879	Hence, we got Shadow the Gangsta Hedgehog.
6149180	6157445	But what they haven't realized is that we like Sonic because it's not standard American fare.
6158095	6174468	File this under the Americans are so stupid bin More like, don't try to guesstimate what a completely different culture is going to like Why is it that every time there's a game that's targeted at America, it usually really stinks?
6175289	6184216	I don't know, maybe I'm just doing an overall broad generalization I thought it was a cool looking character, really well designed But other than that, the concept was just crap
6185097	6186118	Sonic Colors Sonic Colors
6207828	6208468	It's out already.
6208788	6211369	I know, but I can't afford it right now.
6211609	6215810	There is a game that was targeted for the US or whatever that wasn't that bad.
6215910	6219230	Secret of Evermore was horribly underrated.
6219510	6221031	It actually was a pretty good game.
6221551	6222851	Yeah, I had the Super Nintendo.
6222891	6225211	I probably still have the Super Nintendo cart in a bin somewhere.
6225671	6229532	But yeah, that was not as terrible as people made it out to me.
6229672	6233373	I mean, it was no second to Setsu 3, but it was good in its own way.
6234373	6261757	and wasn't that the first game that uh what's his name the guy who does all the music for like Guild Wars and Oblivion Jeremy Soleil he did that was like his first soundtrack I think with Secret of Evermore so I guess it's rare but it does happen occasionally let's move on yes um now I don't I'm gonna try to report this without sounding hateful
6264508	6269870	We could use a Loki rant tonight, I'm just saying.
6270270	6273211	Gran Turismo 5's creator wants to add monthly updates.
6274611	6275111	That's fine.
6275551	6276011	That's cool.
6276472	6279552	Plans premium car upgrades later on, stuff like that.
6280053	6286194	So basically, they're saying that they don't consider their work complete yet.
6286254	6286495	Really?
6286575	6287875	You think that that game wasn't
6288275	6299563	Rush to market because it's been in development for years now and they really need to get it out this year because delaying it again, people would just kind of roll their eyes at them.
6299703	6309930	But I remember there's only about a fifth of the vehicles that are represented in the game right now with premium models, which feature higher resolution textures.
6310251	6310791	Yes, that's right.
6310851	6314314	Some of the models in the game aren't quite as finished as others.
6315074	6325662	But don't worry, they're going to be adding patches later on to add some new items, including new premium cars available for download.
6326442	6329424	And they haven't said yet whether those updates will be free.
6329905	6338070	Great, so you can pay, or possibly pay more, for more of your game that you purchased that isn't quite done yet.
6338571	6340752	But don't worry, they'll finish it someday.
6341393	6342554	They'll call it Gran Turismo 6.
6347306	6353649	Do you think Gran Turismo 6 is going to come out for the PS3, or do you think we're going to wait for the next big system, next console?
6354249	6354469	Yeah.
6354789	6356590	What about that whole 10-year life cycle thing?
6356630	6357591	We're only, what, four years in?
6357611	6358071	Well, don't worry.
6358091	6362854	Gran Turismo 6 Prologue will be coming out, and it will be totally like the game was.
6363634	6367536	Man, that's got to... Well, I don't know if it's got to suck for the people that bought Prologue.
6367556	6370838	I mean, I think that's a dumb idea to buy the game anyways, Prologue, because...
6372332	6372892	What's the point?
6373032	6375053	You're like paying for a demo, basically.
6375113	6376533	Oh, no, no, it's a full-featured game.
6378013	6379874	With, like, you know, very few cars.
6381254	6382614	Alright, well... Oh, sorry.
6382954	6383614	No, it's not a demo.
6384675	6391216	Alright, coming also to the PlayStation 3 very soon, and a lot of people are excited about this, even though this game was already out some time ago.
6391596	6396717	Mass Effect 2 is coming out to the PlayStation 3, but there's some, you know, some tweaks and some upgrades and some new things.
6397437	6399598	Mass Effect 3, of course, is coming out in 2011.
6399958	6408082	But you, of course, have this whole weird thing going on where Mass Effect 2 is coming out on the PlayStation 3, but Mass Effect 1 never came out.
6408443	6412204	So if I don't own an Xbox, how do I get that experience of Mass Effect 1?
6412905	6413965	Well, they've figured it out.
6414245	6419608	There's an interactive comic that's going to come with Mass Effect 2 called Mass Effect Genesis.
6419948	6421089	And what it does is a really quick...
6423910	6446308	I don't want to say it's a playthrough because it's a comic but it's a real quick summary I guess of the 360 and the PC game Mass Effect 1 but you also get to actually do some things in this comic that you did in the original game you get to make they're saying six decisions that you made in Mass Effect 1 that will now impact your Mass Effect 2 game
6446408	6450170	I hope one of those decisions is making sweet, sweet love to the alien chick.
6450210	6452531	Yes, wasn't the whole lesbian thing in Mass Effect 1?
6452831	6454612	Hopefully that is one decision.
6455132	6456593	But I'm not going to hold my breath.
6456893	6464917	But yeah, apparently you will get to make some of the decisions and have your game impacted just like you could play Mass Effect 1 and have your game get impacted in Mass Effect 2.
6465137	6465918	So that's kind of neat.
6467639	6471160	So a PlayStation 3 gamer will get to start the game...
6473762	6481686	do the opening sequence and then they're going to go into this comic that I guess will then impact the game later on so that's kind of cool I like that
6483604	6505923	so again that is coming out in January Mass Effect 1 they are saying is not going to come out for the Playstation 3 because they're going to move on to Mass Effect 3 so this is as close as you're ever going to get unless you happen to own a PC which you probably do if you're listening to this show and you can go play Mass Effect 1 I don't know if Mac has Mass Effect 1 if it does it's probably on Steam there you go
6507489	6518699	We're going to go now to the mailbag where folks can send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and every week we read your emails live here on air and respond to them.
6519519	6523603	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Two emails.
6525154	6536918	Hi everyone, I have a question that can possibly be answered by the OLR gang and chatroom.
6537438	6541739	I'm an avid knitter and I'm looking for video game character garments that look like they were knitted.
6542180	6552183	The only two examples I can think of are Riku's scarf from Final Fantasy X-2 and Nora's SCM sweater slash vest in Final Fantasy XIII Pictures Attached.
6552763	6563328	I've got no problems, no projects going on and I'm waiting to start Nora's Sweater Slash Vest as soon as I get patterns from someone to make them up for me because I don't know anything about sewing and patterns.
6563488	6564609	Thanks so much, Stan.
6565229	6565469	P.S.
6565509	6570671	Last time I wrote in I was telling you about how a friend said I wasn't a gamer because I didn't like certain games.
6570791	6572252	Well, I confronted him and we're cool now.
6572692	6577875	In fact, the other friend was with us when I brought it up and made them both listen to that episode of your show and now he's a fan.
6578175	6578955	Did I already share this?
6579395	6579876	I didn't know.
6580056	6580296	Oh well.
6581076	6581737	I don't think so.
6581837	6582578	That's kind of cool.
6583058	6586622	That's really awesome that we can make fun of your friend and he's still a fan of the show.
6586882	6587243	Awesome.
6588084	6590246	I'm checking out this... Oh, yeah.
6590406	6591968	Yeah, you're into the whole knitting thing.
6593209	6594050	I crochet, Rob.
6594750	6596352	Oh, I always get the two confused.
6596452	6597333	Yeah, knitting...
6599099	6603023	I think you can do more with knitting, but I don't have the coordination for it.
6603043	6606666	Now, when I tried to learn again, it really made my hand hurt.
6607427	6613893	I mean, crochet will do it to me after a while because I finished a hat for Becky that was really... Yeah, but you got that whole trigger finger thing still, don't you?
6613933	6617256	Like residual stuff from when that was really bothering you.
6617696	6619498	Well, I'm sure there's also characters that wear hats.
6620260	6623842	Yeah, I would think like a lot of like, I don't know, for some reason I think of the Zelda world.
6624222	6626704	I also think of a game you should look up is Eternal Sonata.
6627064	6630446	Like, I don't know if there was a lot, but I don't know why I just think of that game.
6630906	6638590	But something that could be like a creative idea, like if you're really looking for projects that, you know, I kind of see these things online once in a while, and I always thought they were kind of cool.
6639050	6640871	Like, look up 8-bit sprites.
6641412	6645154	And there's a lot of websites around that have like 8-bit sprite repositories.
6645174	6645454	Yeah.
6647575	6647755	Really?
6647775	6657520	Because I was going to say you could do, I mean, but still it kind of gives you an idea like how to knit, like if you want to make like a blanket or some other type of throw or something.
6657601	6659241	I can't believe I'm actually talking about knitting.
6660962	6664204	You can get some ideas for patterns from like old school 8-bit sprites, I would think.
6664284	6666485	I mean, you're not going to get clothed patterns, but.
6667346	6674590	I have to sit and draw it, but I did have a plan for a much later project of crocheting a Tetris blanket.
6676251	6676791	Oh, that's fun.
6677293	6682897	I'd crochet it actually in the blocks and then attach the box with yarn.
6683937	6686819	But right now I don't have the time or patience for it.
6687059	6690862	What about like a pillow front thing or is that more of a needle point type of thing?
6691342	6692463	You could crochet a sham.
6694721	6698604	But as far as like actual clothing, gosh, nothing really comes to mind for me.
6698905	6701307	I think the best place to go would be RPGs.
6701507	6704049	And I don't know why, but I'm thinking of the characters from Eternal Sonata.
6704109	6707351	Like I've seen one that had a lot of knitting type stuff.
6708592	6708973	I don't know.
6709773	6710073	I don't know.
6710334	6711134	Does Dan know?
6711895	6715458	Dan, do you know video game characters that wear knitted outfits?
6717920	6718820	Did he give you the face?
6719261	6720822	He just gave me this face of shit.
6720882	6721062	No.
6721402	6722123	No, Rob, I don't.
6725208	6726370	Dance is Earthbound.
6726390	6727831	Oh, Earthbound.
6728572	6729353	Ness's Sweat.
6729473	6730194	Oh my gosh.
6730415	6731616	Knitting advice from Dan.
6731696	6734059	Ness's Sweater could very well be knitted.
6734680	6735601	What a wonderful idea.
6736542	6737023	Who would have thought?
6737043	6738024	Dance is Freddy Krueger.
6739726	6741008	Hey, there's Nightmare on Elm Street.
6741028	6741489	That was a game.
6744407	6746389	Dan goes, a really bad game.
6746470	6748532	Now, did he send pictures of his projects?
6748552	6750274	Because I'm seeing pictures of the characters.
6750314	6751015	No, just the characters.
6751035	6752597	Well, we need to see pictures of your work.
6753358	6755341	So, we'll be awaiting those pictures.
6756222	6758906	That's a really... See, I think in a lot of games...
6759366	6759967	Well, last email.
6784008	6784648	Hey guys!
6784948	6785248	Hey!
6786168	6791730	For Festivus slash Decemberween, one of my friends gifted me with her PlayStation 2, which she no longer uses.
6792170	6792630	Nice gift.
6793110	6798551	This is extremely awesome considering that one of my evil exes took my old PS2.
6798591	6806633	The downside is that the only PS2 game I still own is Final Fantasy X. How about helping me to rebuild my PS2 library by suggesting a few good games for me to buy?
6806853	6807773	Thanks, Tiara.
6808393	6808753	P.S.
6809393	6810674	Oh my god, Rob, I want to be on Horde House 11DR.
6812174	6814335	I wanted her on last week, but it didn't work out.
6814435	6816997	So I'll talk to you offline, Tiara.
6817017	6818798	We do want to have you on as a guest, so maybe next week.
6820038	6821319	We've got to find a Thursday that you're free.
6822560	6822940	But anyway.
6823598	6824538	PS2 games.
6825319	6825939	PS2 games.
6826560	6827820	Any of the Silent Hills that came out?
6827860	6828961	Absolutely the Silent Hill games.
6829261	6830862	Actually, I would say get Silent Hill 2 and 3.
6831922	6838846	If Tiara owns Final Fantasy X, then I'm going to guess that she's a role-play game type fan.
6839226	6840046	So definitely X-2.
6840086	6845129	XII was horrifically underrated because it came out right when the new consoles were coming out.
6845489	6845949	I'll lend you mine.
6845969	6846630	Yeah, that's a good one.
6847370	6850631	I think the .hack games were always really underrated.
6850971	6854092	It's that whole simulated MMO thing, but they're a little more action-y.
6854812	6856173	I think those are really good to look into.
6856293	6857393	I can't remember the name of the first one.
6857433	6861154	It's .hack, Volume 1, Infection.
6861194	6861634	Thank you, Dan.
6861714	6862135	Dan knows.
6863135	6866936	Magic Pen Gel was an underlooked RPG game.
6866956	6870257	That's the one where you could draw wieners, and then they could go into battle and stuff.
6870357	6873078	We had a lot of fun on that with that game in the early days of the show.
6873958	6874759	and Graffiti Kingdom.
6875219	6879401	Of course there are tons and tons of DDR games if you want to get your music game thing on.
6880282	6884464	Amplitude and Frequency are both very good games even though you can't play Amplitude online anymore.
6885305	6886786	Get the Space Channel 5 package.
6887126	6890128	There's Space Channel 5 Part 1 and 2 were released together combined.
6890268	6892289	I'm unwinding my thing and I'm going into the vault.
6892389	6896491	I'm trying to think of like other epic PS2 games that came out.
6896531	6899473	DarkSakura is actually taking her microphone into the vault to give TR suggestions.
6899493	6900253	It's a little stretch.
6901634	6905076	Some folks in chat, not fans of Final Fantasy XII, actually.
6905936	6906456	It won't reach.
6907357	6910358	Jessica Harper is suggesting Kingdom Hearts, of course.
6910378	6911158	Yes, Kingdom Hearts.
6911178	6912039	That's a great one.
6912359	6913979	Solar Flare suggests Rez.
6915460	6916521	That's a good one as well.
6917301	6918121	I'll show you Rez.
6919142	6921903	Long Sagat suggests the Metal Slug Anthology.
6923684	6924784	That's always a good one as well.
6925084	6926405	The Metal Gear Solid games.
6926425	6926885	That's a great one.
6928599	6930240	Good PS2 games you need to have.
6930340	6932141	Katamari Damacy from Ranma.
6932822	6935144	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
6935464	6937886	Yes, Dragon Quest VIII was awesome.
6939847	6941148	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
6941308	6942789	It's still awesome today.
6943510	6948314	Tiara, that's like $200 worth of video games we just suggested to you.
6948454	6951476	However, I will lend you my Final Fantasy XII if you're interested.
6952333	6952513	As do I.
6971351	6973792	Maybe someone might be bringing some of them in person.
6973992	6974252	Maybe.
6974272	6974953	It would be awesome.
6975753	6976613	If one is not broke.
6976854	6977094	All right.
6977114	6978154	Good suggestions, guys.
6978574	6978975	Oh, gosh.
6979055	6979275	More.
6979355	6979795	More of them.
6979815	6980475	Just real quickly.
6981976	6983056	She actually sent me a message.
6983136	6984317	Woo, a zillion games.
6984477	6985558	Xena Saga 1 and 3.
6986478	6987238	Yakuza.
6987979	6988819	Metal Gear Solid 2.
6990340	6991580	Shadow of the Colossus.
6992421	6995822	Sorry, Tiara, but Zillion is actually on the Sega Master System.
6998075	6998315	All right.
6998676	6999917	That's it for the emails tonight.
7000017	7004660	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some emails for next week.
7005001	7006922	Jessica Harper is saying, I want to go to Vegas.
7006982	7007723	Take me too.
7008564	7016650	But if you haven't heard that episode of the show, just make sure that Jessica doesn't run into any DDR freak people because you never know what freaky things might happen.
7018512	7019252	I'm just playing.
7019412	7020974	I'm just messing because I can.
7021294	7021594	All right.
7022115	7023115	That's just serious.
7023356	7023656	I know.
7023956	7024136	All right.
7024156	7025357	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
7025858	7027259	It's the part of the show where we get angsty.
7044684	7047345	I really don't have an FU, to be honest.
7048386	7049847	I'm actually having a great week.
7049887	7050687	I passed Algebra.
7051848	7054249	So I'm going to say FU to the Photoshop Selection Tool.
7055030	7057511	That's it.
7057591	7058612	Loki, do you have an FU of the week?
7059629	7060951	Yeah, FU the Comcast.
7061231	7062572	That's my surprise.
7063012	7064373	Yeah, big surprise.
7064734	7069138	Yeah, fuck them for not being able to hook up my cable correctly.
7069298	7076884	It apparently takes them numerous crews to do something very simple like running a drop to the street.
7077004	7080247	Apparently they have a crew that specializes in underground installations.
7080587	7083290	Oh, but that crew doesn't know how to actually hook up anything.
7083550	7084210	Thank you for watching!
7113810	7118215	I was about to install my own damn cable when I was like, hey, you know what?
7118375	7119496	Why the hell am I doing this?
7121538	7127545	So, yes, they really need to, I don't know, get their shit straight.
7129467	7135472	Um, gosh, I don't really have a strong FU to follow up to that, but I will say FU to traffic.
7136232	7141816	I had to drive to the Bay Area on Friday night, and it took me like three and a half hours to get there thanks to a traffic jam on 880.
7141857	7141957	So FU 880!
7141997	7142157	You suck!
7145479	7146360	Dan the Man's in the house.
7146380	7147100	You want to give an FU?
7148001	7148461	It should be on.
7148481	7148801	Hello?
7148841	7149022	Hello?
7149042	7149642	Yeah, you're there.
7150342	7152164	I'd like to throw an FU to God.
7152924	7153925	Or at least the weather.
7154605	7155966	For really sucking ass.
7156326	7158808	Right before I have to drive for like 15 hours.
7159348	7159649	Thanks.
7159909	7160529	That's real cute.
7160669	7161630	It's all real nice.
7161990	7162831	Real, real good.
7163131	7169815	The week that I have to drive someplace, snow and rain and crap from the sky.
7169875	7171036	And who else can I blame?
7171056	7171997	God.
7172037	7172257	God.
7173880	7174321	Suck a dick.
7174901	7175542	Mother Nature.
7176603	7179425	He was also really pissed at me because I was so drawn on Tuesday.
7180887	7182288	Yeah, but Dan got over it because he saw it.
7182749	7185531	I'm going to say this for the record.
7186452	7188995	I don't know what my wife's problem is, but I'm a fair man.
7189739	7219325	I got to go to the Tron sneak preview on IMAX and I didn't tell her a lot about it because she didn't want to hear about it because she was a little bitter so she got so she got to go to the Tron sneak preview and I was a little bitter but I wasn't going to be like no because I've gotten to go and it all worked out fine for me because thanks to the unstoppable pimp Matt I got to go see it for free and it was awesome it was awesome so I want to throw an F you to Jamie for going to see Tron early
7221578	7222098	Don't elbow me.
7222118	7223719	Thank you, Dan.
7223799	7223960	Black.
7223980	7224080	Cock.
7244950	7246292	What happened to the show?
7247694	7251299	One minute we're just giving our little FUs and reading emails.
7251920	7254124	And now we're just giving out the hot dickings.
7254164	7255245	Wait, that's Dr. Tran.
7258905	7261386	Jessica's in chat saying, I deserve that FU.
7261426	7262987	Sorry, Dan.
7265168	7266409	Dan's yelling from the other room.
7266429	7267089	It ain't her fault.
7267750	7268350	It ain't her fault.
7270491	7270831	That's right.
7270851	7273873	You gotta act on those opportunities.
7274613	7276414	You gotta.
7277695	7280156	Anyhow, let's move on to... Where are we at?
7280176	7280817	The skypline?
7280857	7282978	No, we got a couple more stories and then the skypline.
7284539	7287821	Dan, get a mic or GTFO.
7288141	7288401	Alright.
7291632	7295974	1-877-GAME-OLR in just a little bit right after two more stories for you guys, Loki.
7297435	7305038	When I first saw this headline, I was like, sweet, Xbox is finally getting all risque because they said goodbye, gal gun panties.
7305058	7305738	I was like, ooh.
7307632	7309054	I didn't think they would go there.
7326172	7342667	Apparently, I guess 79 days before the game's release in Japan, Microsoft called a meeting with the Gal Gun developer, Alchemist, and they basically said, you know what, we're going to have to censor the game and not put all these panty shots in there.
7343968	7344949	But that's the point.
7346050	7347451	How are you going to sell the game now?
7348812	7349593	They're saying now...
7352222	7353543	I don't know.
7354243	7360806	Basically, because I guess the game... I don't know if the game uses the Kinect or whatever.
7363048	7368190	Maybe that they're trying to gear it more towards a family game or now.
7369031	7369351	I don't know.
7369391	7370171	I think they really should.
7370191	7371732	A game that's fun for the whole family.
7373493	7374834	Hot chicks bending over.
7374854	7375474	Yeah.
7377063	7378344	X and A game, come on.
7379085	7381566	X and A. Here's something you can use the Kinect for.
7381987	7382727	Spanking.
7383488	7387991	When those naughty girls bend over, you can spank them with the Kinect.
7388752	7389632	Come on, you know you want it.
7390053	7390713	Spanking game?
7390753	7391494	Yes or no, Loki?
7393095	7396477	Not my forte, but who am I to judge other people?
7400598	7401099	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7416434	7419296	E was her head T was her cleavage M was her naked vagina censored obviously because it's classy
7441154	7444117	and AO was tentacles sneaking up.
7444978	7447761	And Nellie's like, what is that?
7448481	7450503	I'm like, it's tentacle rape.
7450883	7453446	Well, it's something that's popular in Japan, you know, in anime.
7453466	7455167	So I'm just like, what?
7459649	7473466	TigerClaw in our chatroom says Maybe it's the game parents will use when kids ask them where do babies come from SolarFlare in our chatroom at chat.org.com says Rob, spanking teaches kids to hit
7476305	7481447	One more story for you guys, and it has to do with indie games and the Humble Bundle.
7481907	7490672	Humble Bundle 2 was released this past week, and in less than 24 hours after its release, it got over $500,000 in revenue.
7491032	7495174	This is notable because this was one of those pay-what-you-want type of games.
7496134	7499236	Five games for whatever you want to pay for it, DRM-free.
7500296	7503598	The biggest payer was Marcus Persson
7504238	7505820	Infinity Ward's Robert Bowling spent $500.
7519740	7520200	on the pack.
7520361	7520801	So there you go.
7520861	7524263	The average price that people are paying for this, $7 and change.
7524623	7530626	The pack comes with Braid, Cortex Command, Machinarium, Osmos, and Revenge of the Titans.
7531066	7537710	You can divide your payments between the developers, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Child's Play charity.
7538030	7543153	So in other words, if you don't want to pay the developers, you want 100% of your donation to go to Child's Play, go for it.
7544054	7551464	that indeed is some developers being very humble in allowing that to be sold very cool twitter.com slash humble for more information on that
7552170	7554012	Alright, very cool.
7554672	7556113	We're going to go to the Skype line now.
7556153	7556854	Let me open it up.
7557014	7557935	I don't have it open right now.
7558015	7558515	Now it's open.
7558535	7563519	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7563839	7572146	Remember, if you are going to give us a call on Skype, you do want to give Echo123 a call first to make sure your connection works.
7572246	7573487	Please, please do us all a favor.
7573888	7576289	If you're on Skype itself, Echo123.
7576390	7579932	The 800 number is a lot easier because all you need for that is a phone.
7579972	7580353	That's 877-GAME-OLR.
7582165	7588007	While we wait for some calls, because there's a little bit of a delay between when I ask for calls and when they start coming in, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?
7589468	7590028	No, I don't.
7591329	7596091	I'm starting a new trend by Tron-izing a picture of myself like people were doing with Avatar.
7596711	7597071	Oh, really?
7598132	7599392	Oh, that's kind of cute what you're doing.
7599912	7600172	Yeah.
7601213	7607155	I'm surprised there's no, like, filter thingy on Photoshop or one of those programs that will kind of automatically do something-ish.
7608236	7608376	So...
7609301	7610642	Alright, well let's go to the phone.
7610662	7611723	We got a call coming in.
7611823	7614466	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7614486	7614846	Who's this?
7615367	7616247	Hey, this is X-Link.
7616347	7616848	Hi, X-Link.
7616868	7617488	What's on your mind, buddy?
7617949	7622833	You forgot about one game series in particular for the PS2 and I'm quite upset at you for doing this, Rob.
7623274	7624395	The Persona series.
7625709	7627931	I thought somebody in chat said Persona, and I said it.
7627991	7628471	My bad.
7629212	7632734	Actually, any title with Atlas is pretty much gold.
7632954	7638058	I haven't come across really one game from Atlas that's really so terrible that I would not talk about it.
7638478	7641540	Actually, they have a really good game on PS3, Demon's Sword.
7641860	7643381	Or no, what am I thinking?
7643421	7643982	No, scratch that.
7644022	7647164	Demon's Souls is the game that's out on PS3.
7647204	7649806	That's a great PS3 exclusive game.
7649846	7654749	In fact, I believe it was just given a price reduction because it's in the Greatest Hits series, and the servers,
7655369	7663959	I think one of the stories that missed our show all this week, but I remember reading the servers are going to be open through at least March 2011, if not beyond.
7664440	7672489	And definitely, if you're looking for a long series of playtime with a role-playing game, .hack series is really, really good.
7672569	7674351	There was the four games, and then there was the...
7675072	7678575	3 for the GU, which was happening right after.
7678635	7681318	So they keep the storyline pretty much intact throughout the whole thing.
7681358	7690667	But it's really cool how you can take your save game from the first game, put in a second, save the second game into the third, the third game into the fourth.
7690707	7691868	So you can carry it on.
7691988	7696253	And then if you take it and put it into the GU series, which happened a few years after,
7702834	7707798	RayCraft in our chatroom is correcting me saying Demon's Souls isn't an Atlus game, they just published it.
7707858	7708358	Well, still.
7709159	7710800	Still, it's a great game.
7713622	7716463	SSJ100 They don't put their name behind sucky games.
7716663	7716863	Right.
7717583	7720223	And hopefully they'll get President Cat and everything will be well.
7720504	7720904	Exactly.
7720944	7722104	They need President Cat.
7722224	7724184	SSJ100 Matt is also saying Disgaea.
7724244	7726905	Now there's a good suggestion.
7728505	7731626	Also, if you happen to be in a Japanese region, Earth Defense Force 2.
7731826	7733927	Ooh, good thought.
7734327	7734967	Very good thought.
7736367	7737987	So what else is on your mind, X-Link?
7738047	7740448	Anything else fun and exciting going on in your gaming world?
7740851	7741432	Well, I don't know.
7741512	7752430	Well, I'm kind of disappointed you haven't invited me onto your show yet either, considering that I was the number one achieving core in your guild for quite a while, if I remember correctly, before someone took my spot.
7754591	7758793	That's quite okay, because I'm not going to be bitter or anything about that at all.
7758933	7759834	And you shouldn't be.
7759914	7765357	Thankfully, there's been a lot of people that have wanted to be on, so we're trying to give everybody a shot.
7765777	7766998	I know, I'm playing around.
7767058	7772481	Rice Princess was only on because we kind of needed someone quickly, so she came back on twice.
7773221	7774882	But we're going to get lots of people on.
7776343	7776963	That's cool.
7777043	7779945	But yeah, I'm very much enjoying Cataclysm.
7780697	7784059	Keeping up to the wee hours in the morning playing all the different stuff for it.
7784319	7786440	How many hours have you spent on your archaeology?
7788621	7789241	You know what?
7789281	7790262	It hasn't been that long.
7790722	7792343	Believe it or not, I spent...
7793522	7796463	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7816351	7817712	Deathwing showed up while I was doing archaeology.
7845526	7845786	All right.
7846487	7848228	Did you survive or did you actually die?
7848328	7849729	I actually survived.
7849769	7856835	Not to turn this into the WoW show, but I actually survived because what I did, I flew through the fire instead of getting on the ground.
7856875	7858056	The timing or something worked out.
7858076	7859177	I got the achievement and didn't die.
7860928	7865052	My friend, she was in Ratchet and she actually lived with like one hit point or something.
7865072	7866954	It was weird, but she couldn't believe it.
7866974	7869137	She's like, yeah, I actually got an achievement, but yet I lived.
7869217	7872220	And she took an awesome screenshot of the town.
7872320	7874622	I mean, just totally engulfed in flames everywhere.
7874682	7879327	I mean, you couldn't even really tell it was that for a bit because of the flames in the background.
7879367	7880969	But it was a really cool screenshot.
7881389	7881890	Good times.
7882372	7886515	All right, well, I should let you go before the WoW haters come out and start saying, you guys talk too much WoW.
7886655	7887395	Too much WoW on the show.
7887415	7889016	And welcome to the guild, Jamie.
7889477	7889777	All right.
7890797	7891738	Take care, X-Link.
7891838	7892939	She's busy on her Tron pic.
7893299	7893559	Later.
7894200	7894960	All right, no problem.
7895160	7895440	Bye.
7897122	7898943	All right, 1877gameOLR.
7898963	7899943	Did you even hear that, DarkSarka?
7899983	7900964	He said, welcome to the guild.
7901124	7902125	She has a pet in her mouth right now.
7902305	7903906	No, I heard, and thank you.
7904967	7905367	See you, Rob?
7905627	7906087	Season four?
7906447	7908129	You have your little Tron-y looking headband.
7908149	7908869	I'm working on the eyes.
7909229	7909970	There you go.
7909990	7910190	Oh, okay.
7911540	7916783	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
7916863	7918064	But we got a call coming in right now.
7918564	7919725	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7919765	7920145	Who's this?
7920765	7922586	This would be Miss Jessica Harper.
7922747	7923787	Hi, Jessica Harper.
7923827	7924327	How are you?
7924788	7925548	I am doing just fine.
7925588	7926249	How are you guys doing?
7926369	7926769	Great.
7926849	7928130	So glad to have you back on the show.
7928170	7929590	What's new?
7929670	7931632	I actually came with an agenda tonight.
7931712	7932012	Uh-oh.
7933381	7942266	Something that I believe you guys spoke about before as per my conversation with Jamie, but we have USOLR Madness.
7943567	7949951	We are currently taking your top 25 lists, and unfortunately we haven't received as many as we would like.
7950872	7951452	You know what it is?
7951492	7952973	They're a bunch of procrastinators.
7953658	7954358	Yeah, I know.
7954598	7955919	But the deadline is coming up.
7956299	7966943	And since USL will be on hiatus just based on how the holidays fall, since we have Christmas on a Saturday and then New Year's Eve on a Saturday.
7967243	7967863	Yikes, yeah.
7968183	7968383	Yeah.
7969123	7970824	Kind of puts us in a little bit of a hiatus.
7970864	7976806	So I thought I'd come and be a pain in your ass and talk about it on your show instead.
7976886	7978907	We think it's great what you guys do over there.
7979307	7981908	Why USL OLR Madness?
7983475	7999160	because it is the way that you, the gaming audience, can actually get your voice out there and be heard and show what the real games that people love are rather than those that are just being highly profitable because...
8000202	8002083	People are spending way too much money on stupid shit.
8002583	8008005	And it won't be rigged for Final Fantasy 7 like the GameFAQs contest for every year.
8008365	8010586	Every year it's Final Fantasy 7 something.
8011586	8012327	Yeah, exactly.
8012547	8015788	Final Fantasy 7 could win.
8015888	8021270	It has been in the top 16, but I don't believe it's won a Madness title yet.
8040500	8047284	If anybody wants to get their top 25 list in and has not yet, just go ahead and formulate your top 25 list.
8047725	8057410	Send it to uslmadness at gmail.com We will tack it on in with the rest of the votes and deadline is January 3rd.
8058131	8061933	So get your votes in and we will be starting right after the holidays.
8062668	8063529	Excited to see it.
8064269	8071134	I'm trying to pull up my list that I had actually sent to Brestle so I can give you a little taste of what I'm rooting for here.
8071194	8073176	Hold on, I'm trying to pull it up in my email archive here.
8074016	8076638	I set my list on November 30th because I'm a very good boy.
8076818	8077539	Wow, you're a good boy.
8078739	8079859	I'll give you just a little taste.
8079919	8083400	My number one game, of course, was Super Metroid.
8083540	8084260	I mean, duh.
8085000	8086021	It is the best game ever.
8086381	8089021	My number two game this year was the Civilization series.
8089421	8098763	I think between five out this year and four being so epic and the original being so awesome, I think Civ is deserving of a spot that high up.
8098803	8101284	With five this year, I was just like, oh, this is all amazeballs.
8101864	8102844	My number three game...
8103664	8107226	Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, Metroidvania, Final Fantasy 6, Plants vs. Zombies
8126213	8128315	Oh, maybe it'll make the top 64 then.
8128335	8131617	But that's the weird thing is that John has been keeping good track of things.
8132217	8135019	It has not breached the top 25 recently.
8136640	8140863	During the initial voting, it was one of the top 25 and it did get pushed out.
8140903	8142524	It's not even in the bubble zone right now.
8142624	8147748	So if you love Plants vs. Zombies, you better put it on your list.
8148128	8153031	If you think Plants vs. Zombies is the greatest game ever made, you better hurry the hell up and get in there.
8153471	8153692	Yes.
8156794	8157254	Awesome.
8157294	8157934	Well, what else?
8157994	8159536	Anything else going on in your world, Jessica?
8159556	8160576	Do you want to share with us?
8161177	8168402	Well, I got a new computer and I have a brand new video card that I'm ready to put into it, but it is a slim computer.
8168682	8173085	And while I did get a low profile card, I do not have the proper brackets for it.
8173225	8181992	So I'm in a holding pattern once again and just waiting for my brackets so I can put my new video card in and actually start doing some decent PC gaming.
8182012	8182292	Awesome.
8182854	8184176	I actually had something similar happen.
8184196	8189223	When I bought a new video card, it was so Uber, it wouldn't fit in there with the power supply.
8189703	8193308	So we had to get a new power supply as well to make it all work.
8194590	8199897	It's going to be a very tight squeeze, and I'm not quite sure exactly how it's going to work, but I'll make it work, damn it.
8199977	8200437	There you go.
8200477	8201639	So when are you signing up for WoW?
8202019	8202800	Just kidding.
8202900	8203060	No.
8203220	8203620	I'm kidding.
8203660	8204001	I'm kidding.
8204521	8209025	No, I have a feeling that I might end up with Star Trek Online somewhere in my mailbox at some point.
8209065	8209566	I'm not sure.
8210426	8213069	So I'm thinking STO is going to be the game of choice.
8214150	8215351	If you want a 10-day trial, let me know.
8215391	8216292	I may still have another card.
8216412	8217353	DarkSakura's recruiting.
8218233	8218874	We shall see.
8219014	8219535	We shall see.
8219895	8220195	All right.
8220536	8220816	Oh, yeah.
8220856	8223298	And of course, Travis is a big fan of that, too.
8223598	8224359	Disney.
8224439	8224639	Yes.
8225200	8226181	I wouldn't be surprised at all.
8226801	8228904	Alright, well Jessica, good luck with the new PC.
8229064	8232088	I hope it brings you lots of gaming joy this holiday season.
8232189	8235393	It's already brought me Plants vs. Zombies, so there you go.
8236014	8238317	Best of luck with everything going on at Under Station Live.
8238357	8241361	Sorry to hear about the bad timing of the holidays this year, but hey, enjoy the break.
8242182	8242803	Thank you very much.
8243023	8243663	Alright, take care.
8244084	8244664	Have a good night, guys.
8244684	8244904	You too.
8264480	8272261	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call We are taking some calls Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio
8273220	8276021	Shadow the Hedgehog was made for Americans, or whatever, or the, you know...
8301826	8309892	Let's not get shadowed I already said my two cents about that in the chat room What's on your mind, buddy?
8309932	8310392	Why'd you call?
8311226	8319852	Well, to satisfy Breslow, I finally sent out my 25 because I realized I didn't play enough games this year to qualify.
8319892	8326357	So I'm sitting there for about an hour putting my list together and picking the brains of my roommates for what games did you like?
8326517	8329379	Well, keep in mind, it's not the top 25 of this year.
8329439	8331280	It's the top 25 of all time.
8331861	8334483	I know, but still, I just feel like I don't really game enough for it.
8334503	8336424	But I got my list together and I sent it out.
8336824	8337425	All right, good boy.
8338021	8340003	and I did put on there Final Fantasy 6.
8340503	8341244	Good man.
8341284	8342565	That's a great Final Fantasy game.
8342625	8346689	Although Final Fantasy 4 I sometimes call my favorite.
8346969	8352634	I gave it a little bit of a backseat which is funny because I sent that list in before the news about the PSP version.
8353575	8358379	It will probably be back near the top of my list next year after I play the PSP version.
8359360	8360020	Fair enough.
8360340	8360721	We'll see.
8362482	8363183	So, alright.
8363243	8364543	Well, what was at the top of your list?
8364584	8365164	Can I be nosy?
8365204	8366004	What was your number one game?
8366185	8366385	Ever?
8367165	8369266	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the game.
8369386	8369667	What?
8369747	8371748	Was your number one game of all time?
8372649	8373969	I loved that game.
8374490	8379613	This is one of the few games where I sat there and played it over and over and over.
8379973	8382975	And this is one of those games where, yeah, tap the bank for the crack.
8383095	8385256	That's what that game fell under for me.
8385536	8385937	Alright.
8386217	8389399	Where every gamer has a voice, even when those voices are insane.
8390520	8390880	I'm kidding.
8390900	8390980	What?
8392589	8394171	I like River City Ransom, I mean, really.
8394371	8395132	I'm giving you shit.
8395252	8408727	Actually, I'm watching Loki in studios playing, I think the new version of Super Mario Crossover, like there was a brand new version that came out, but he is driving the Blaster Master car, and that made me think, oh man, Blaster Master should have been on my list.
8409347	8410148	Wait, what?
8410508	8412410	Blaster Master is in Mario Crossover?
8412650	8414131	Yes, they just added Sofia.
8414311	8417914	The car from Blaster Master is now in Mario Crossover.
8418875	8420796	I now have my reason to play the game.
8422137	8425000	I'm going to tell my roommate and he's going to fangasm.
8426821	8433144	Yeah, I need somebody to send in a top 25 list that has Blaster Master near the top to make up for the fact that I left it off my list.
8433164	8434345	All right, DarkSakura, it says she will.
8434605	8435865	I still haven't sent my list in.
8436145	8436766	Oh, good, good.
8436966	8440187	I need some Blaster Master love because I forgot because I'm an idiot.
8440488	8441628	When do we have to send those lists in?
8442308	8446991	I believe the third was the deadline, but you're procrastinating, but you should do it right now.
8449272	8449572	All right.
8450372	8451593	Anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?
8452355	8454937	The main reason why I called was I want to ask you guys this.
8455577	8462021	Do you think programmers purposely put code into games where you swear it cheats?
8464375	8491606	um it depends on the type of game but like when you say games that cheat my mind automatically goes immediately goes to Super Mario Kart and the whole rubber banding and this is a very common thing you hear in racing games Mario Kart's not the only racing game that does it a lot of them do but yes that's basically programmed cheating is that if you are too far ahead of the other contestants they get to speed boost or whatever to catch up to you that's programmed to cheat to make it more exciting so
8491966	8492567	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8515249	8517950	It's like his team of four growing up with a team of eight.
8517970	8525591	As soon as he walks into the area, that whole team just slaughters him under 15 minutes and he's screaming repeatedly that the game is cheating.
8526611	8528531	Me personally, I don't think the game cheats.
8528731	8529311	You just suck.
8529591	8536153	But that dates all the way back to the NES days when you would be playing a sports game or any type of game.
8536473	8539973	RC Pro-Am was another racer that would just infuriate people.
8540333	8542054	The game's fucking cheating, man.
8542074	8543214	This game fucking cheats.
8543234	8543414	Yeah.
8545274	8553138	I can understand if they actually put in purpose code for cheating compared to where your skills aren't good enough, Padawan.
8553238	8555079	Or it's just ramping up the difficulty.
8555139	8562103	Keep in mind a lot of those NES, and if you want to go way back, Atari 2600 games, were set to loop over and over and over again.
8562403	8569587	So of course the difficulty gets insane and harder than you're able to do at some point because that's just what it is.
8570587	8571008	Of course.
8571528	8573589	Or take a game like Civilization.
8574188	8583112	and at its highest difficulty level, I believe the computer opponents can build resources like 1.4 times as fast as you can.
8583632	8587374	So you have to really think about how to use your resources.
8588188	8607485	well I don't think that's really cheating the game is cheating per se that's just like advanced skill god mode it's like you know what you're getting yourself into when you walk into it yeah and if you can beat that then you're a fucking stud like you are but you know going into it okay I am playing an uphill battle here and if I beat this I'm awesome mhm
8609530	8611191	Yeah, that's exactly what I was getting at.
8611531	8611952	All right.
8612352	8614754	Well, Ranma, we're going to let you go to try to get some more calls tonight.
8614774	8615114	Wonderful.
8615134	8616175	But thank you so much for your call.

8659889	8662891	I'd usually be going around getting some last minute stories, but there aren't any.
8663732	8664532	Loki's read them all.
8665132	8669835	So he's busy playing Super Mario Crossover and DarkSakura's working on her Tron art.
8670596	8672797	And I am telling a monologue right now.
8675729	8678552	Sorry for not participating.
8678692	8679232	That's alright.
8680434	8681434	What do you plan to do with your time off?
8681454	8682756	Do you have any time off from work, Loki?
8683997	8685018	I have 3D weekends.
8685298	8685478	Yeah?
8685498	8686860	Are you going to do anything special with them?
8687160	8687720	No, hang out.
8688121	8689082	Just hang out, be with the baby?
8690458	8691939	You taking the baby anywhere for the holidays?
8692119	8693460	My mom's.
8693960	8695320	But your mom's here are kind of local, right?
8695340	8697041	It's not like you're having to go to the snow or anything?
8697061	8699883	Yeah, she's very close.
8700843	8707146	Someone in our chat room named Hi, I love that name, is saying a new Gorillaz album on Christmas, the fall.
8707907	8709788	DarkSakura, you're the big Gorillaz fan, girl.
8709828	8710888	Yep, I'm looking forward to it.
8711268	8711549	Nice.
8712629	8715210	Like a whole new album for sale?
8715530	8716651	I think like an EP.
8717191	8717932	Oh, okay.
8718072	8718452	That's cool.
8719491	8719751	All right.
8720392	8723555	Well, the phone's not ringing, so I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

8737530	8738011	Tron.
8738992	8740153	Loki, your final thought tonight.
8742575	8744856	My final thought is this game is pretty hard.
8745476	8746397	I blew up, damn it.
8747537	8750118	My final thought of the night is this show is done early enough.
8750498	8751819	I might have time for Pinkberry.
