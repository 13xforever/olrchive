{"text": " Tonight, December 19th, 2010, Cataclysm sells Oodles Noodles, the crime victim calls for the ban of Mafia 2, and Kinect's first sex game gets the smackdown from Microsoft. Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, December 19th, 2010, episode 394. It's the show where every gamer has a voice. Join us live in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com. My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be with you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Yo. How you doing? I'm doing well and energized and electrified. You're energized. Electrified, gosh, you sound, I don't know, like you've just been to Xanadu or something, I don't know. No, I saw Tron twice this week. Oh, wasn't Tron amazing? I know. Okay, I'll get into that in a minute, though, but I have to introduce, of course, the one and only tech master, Loki! Hi. How are you doing, Loki? Fine. You know, I remember a time when you really hated all things Apple, and now it's funny because at the start of the show, I'm always having to tear you away from that new little eye touch you have, or you've had for a couple months now. No, you see, I hate all things Mac, not Apple. Oh, my bad. Apple 2 was a pretty awesome computer back in the day. It's true, it's what we all played Oregon Trail. But I'm sorry, all those Mac computers are way too damn overpriced. Making friends, and we're not even five minutes into the show. It's just the three of us here in studio tonight, sadly no guests joining us, but it is our last show of the year, if you can believe it. We're not going to be here because of the holiday next week, sadly, sorry, but some of us are going out of town, so we're not going to be able to get everybody together to do the show next week. So it's our last show of 2010, ah! So don't worry, guys, we'll be back, of course, in two weeks, and we have plenty of show to go to tonight. So we always like to start things off with how is your gaming week, but can I just say OMG Tron, like, wasn't it great? I know! So you had to go see it, what, Tuesday? How'd you swing that? Well, um, Jessica Harper had an extra ticket. Yeah, and she was on the show a few weeks ago, right? Yes, and, uh, she, uh, let me have it. And so we all went. Nice. And what'd you think? Ugh! Oomph! What was the best part, well, without spoiling, because keep in mind there's a lot of people that are like, OMG, you don't want spoilers, so is there a way you can kind of say the best part of the new Tron movie without ruining everything, anything? Not really, because I like how everything flowed together, but I'd have to say I have a favorite line, as we've discussed earlier, but I'll go ahead and repeat it. The cycles haven't been good, have they? You don't look that bad. Very nice, very nice. Yeah. Loki, you got to see the Trons as well? Yes, I did. How was Tron for you? It was awesome. Yeah? It was just everything I was hoping it would be, so I would definitely see it again. And everybody here saw it in 3D, right? Yeah. Honestly, this is a movie that it is totally beneficial to see it in 3D, because, I'll just say, Wizard of Oz treatment. Yes, it's not all in 3D, but it's very interesting. And yeah, I would just say my favorite part was how they upgraded some things from the old movie, like I, how can I say this without spoiling too much, but okay, y'all know there's going to be a light cycle sequence in it, right? And when they did the whole light cycles, but some of the new stuff they did with it, like in, like I'm doing hand motions here in studio, like I was just like, oh that is something that isn't spoiled by the trailers or the commercials. I know, but I'm trying to be good. If you actually go look on the Tron Wiki, they do explain that they're all different models. Here's the interesting though, just kind of tie it back to what we're all about here at OLR. It made me want to play the game like really bad, and the game has not been kindly treated by the critics out there. It's been getting like average reviews, and when I say average, I mean like a six, which I don't know. Usually when a game gets a six, that means it's really bad. But of course, the movie is only getting like a 40% or something on Rotten Tomatoes. This is not a movie for critics. It's not going to win Oscars. The dialogue and story are all nerd service, but I honestly think like I walked out of that theater, I was just like mind blown. This is a movie worthy of like Star Wars, Star Trek nerd opus, you know. And on top of that, if you have seen the first movie several times and know it very well, and if you've kept up with some of the roundabout stuff, even some of the old deleted scenes, there is a lot in this that makes sense. And you know, I actually went back and was listening to the soundtrack a bit, because keep in mind, I have like the original soundtrack for the original Tron. Oh, but the new soundtrack. When I went back and gave it a solid listen, some of the elements, especially for character theme songs, were incorporated from the original into the new. I just have to say Daft Punk did an astounding job. And I realized like when people listen to the soundtrack the first time, they're like, this isn't like a Daft Punk album. But like the music was like a good, like 80% of the reason why the movie kicked ass so much. Honestly, even though I say it's not like an Oscar caliber movie, this movie ought to be getting nominated for at least some of the technical effects. And seriously, I am not lying. And I'm not being a fanboy. It would be a crime if Daft Punk didn't get nominated for the score, because it adds that much to the movie. Like we don't need some artsy fartsy film, stealing one of the nominations for score, you know, that's kind of like the same old, same old that you always hear in a period piece. This is something like really new and different. I really hope it gets acknowledged. I'm going to spoil one thing. There's nothing after the credits. Oh yeah. Okay. That's not much of a spoiler. Yeah. But you know what else I really like too is how they gave the Disney castle the Tron treatment. Oh, it's awesome. That's so cool. I really want to go see the Disney electronica thing, which I still haven't seen. I have friends there right now. We were supposed to go this weekend, but it just didn't work out. I'm glad we didn't. You know why? It was a cold damn weekend. It got rained. They shut most of it down. But, uh, yeah, I had friends that went down there and they still had a good time, so I'm glad to hear it. I'm, I'm bummed I didn't go, but at the same time, I had a great time at the movie. Just awesome time. I went and saw it at the Metreon. Remember the Metreon? Oh, the poor, poor Metreon. Or now that the lights are burned out, it's the Me-re-on. So I went to the Me-re-on to see the movie. And if you don't know what the Me-re-on is, it's a building in San Francisco and it used to house the official PlayStation Store. And so you'd see a lot of events would be happening at the Me-re-on, uh, where they would have like a line going out and everything. Well, the Sony store is gone. It closed down, I think, last year and now it's an art gallery of some sort, I think. I have no idea. Yeah. They think that's what it was when I walked by. Um, there's still an arcade in the movie theater and there was a arcade upstairs, the Tilt Arcade, which is right by the Walk of Game, which is still there. The, there's, I don't think they've updated it in a while, but it's still there. And uh, yeah, it's kind of sad cause they're selling all these arcade machines, but seriously, some awesome deals. There's a Marvel versus Capcom machine for $300 on sale right now. Um, a BeatMania 5th Mix, which is like the old school movie. Don't tell anybody cause I'm going to buy it. For $5,000. It's a total rip off. That is ridiculous. That is ridiculous. I'm lying. I'm totally lying. It's really this much. That's it. Yeah. But Jamie wants it. So I'm not allowed to tell the listeners. No you're not. Um, so yeah, uh, there's that and uh, oh, this was the funniest thing of all though. Going to the little claw or what? Not the claw machine. You ever seen the ticket redemption machine where the light kind of goes around the marquee and you have to hit the stop button at a certain time and if you hit a stop button, then you win a prize? Okay. I posted this to my Twitter. Do you know what one of the prizes was in there? Still in a sealed box. A Game Boy Advance e-reader machine with cards. That might be a collector's item. I lolled so hard seeing that. It's on my Twitter at twitter.com slash sky S K I E. So anyway, um, let's talk about our gaming weeks. Okay. We're done with Tron talk. Even though I actually really want to play the game now after seeing the movie, like even though I hear it's really repetitive, like that's his biggest problem. Like just, I just want to know more about the story like, and I can't, I think everybody after going to see the movie that I went and saw it with yesterday, like went online and started reading about Tron and like who the actors were in the movie and how it tied into the eighties version. It's just, is that nerd-tastic? All right. How was your gaming week? Dark soccer, actual video games outside of Tron. Well, I, um, I'm playing world of Warcraft addict. No I'm not. No, I'm not because I'm still, I'm still playing Star Trek online and you can call me an addict for that. Double addict. I'm not addicted, but I said I'd give it a chance and I was like, I was seriously this close again to just going, forget it. Like by this close, I mean like holding my fingers, you know, a half an inch apart is like stupid goat people world sucks. Even though I like playing goat people, but I'm leveling faster, so I don't know what's up with that. Um, but it was, it's cool, you know, chatting with everyone in the guild and everything and that's pretty fun. Um, it still seems like more of the same to me, you know, but I'm giving it a chance. I'm somewhere new. I'm playing. Rob gave me some stuff. I'll give you lots of stuff. You have to play for a good month now. But isn't it good to be back? Well, I would ask you what you think of it, but because you've been playing a Draenei, you've really only seen the content that's in Burning Crusade, which I understand you should do what you want to do. Like don't roll another race just because it's somewhere else, but I helped you get somewhere else. So hopefully you'll be able to see some new content. And it still looks the same too. Well. Well, I mean, I didn't make it there last time. I'm in, what's the name of the stupid- Darnassus. Darnassus. Okay. It still looks like night elf stuff. Right. And Darnassus wasn't touched by Deathwing too. You have to, cause it's- He didn't take a big poop on it? He didn't. But once you take the boat to the ruins of Albertine, which used to be Albertine, uh, you'll start to see some of the damage and some of the better stuff, I think. I figured that I'm going to do that when I get like 20 and I'm like, what, 14 now and I've been playing three days. Yeah. You've been doing very well. Which it took me two weeks to get to 20 last time. So I'm, I'm, I'm going to keep going with it. I mean, I'll try, but like, like I said, you know, it's not something that I can keep doing consistently. I'm keeping my attachment to Star Trek Online, which by the way, episode three Star Trek Online came out. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Once a cataclysm or cataclysm, whatever you want to call it, uh, settles down a little bit. That's a internet meme, by the way, if you don't know, uh, once that settles down a little bit, I still want to go back and check out Star Trek Online. Hopefully DC Universe isn't out by that point and kind of derails everything, but I still want to go check it out a little bit, especially since they've changed so much, it sounds like since the beta that I originally had played. Well, and you know, I kind of, I'd like to try out the, the new stuff, but I'm not going to buy two boxes of upgrades unless I'm sure I'm going to play a little bit more. I don't blame it. And even then, you know, if I play, it's going to have to be in the form of, you know, month cards or something. It's still ridiculous that they're charging so much for Wrath of the Lich King. And I think that will come down, just kind of have to wait it out after, probably after the Christmas rush or something, it'll, it'll come down to try and woo new players into the game. Well, that's, that's kind of what I'm hoping for. I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to give up on it. I mean, like I said, if, if I keep playing it, it's going to be, well, I'll buy, um, you know, a month card to play because I'm not getting rid of my Star Trek Online subscription unless STO just starts getting ridiculously crappy. And right now though, my frustration with Star Trek Online is that there's really not a whole lot of new stuff for new characters and I want new factions. We're supposed, they sort of teased that we're supposed to be getting, um, Cardassian faction so I can keep up with the Cardassians. Wow, that's a bad joke. I'm not the first one to think of it either. Um, you know, I want to play, you know, the Romulan stuff that, you know, they're doing a lot of big stories for the Romulan factions and I really, really like what they're doing with the story because they're putting something in it for everybody and it's like, it really does have a feeling for me. Like I'll be chatting with Becky and we'll be talking about Deep Space Nine or something because that's, you know, right now both of us are going back and just rewatching all of Deep Space Nine in parts and, which would be like the 50 millionth time I've watched everything through on Deep Space Nine because it's my favorite. But like, um, I'll say, oh, and by the way, they did this in Star Trek Online and this, this led to this story and this. And she's like, sounds like you're talking like, you know, well, she hasn't said right out, but I feel like I'm talking about an episode and when they actually, when they bring everything up, it's like the way everything flows is like an episode of the show just without acting. That's good because just as someone who is a fan of the Star Trek series, Not Counting Enterprise, um, I, I really wish they would have another show, you know, I really want there to be another TV show and I understand that right now it's like all about the movies and don't even know that new movie was awesome, but I would just love there to be a new show in the next gen Voyager canon, Deep Space Nine canon. You know, I would like, um, well, you know, and I've been going back and reading the books, the, you know, the continuation books, which is really where, and this is going to be kind of a, I'm going to try not to veer too off the point, the, the book universe is very different than the game universe. The book universe is sort of like it's its own tangent. Um, what I like about the game universe is that it incorporated the first movie by saying that this is what happened in the prime timeline and the movie, as I said, is a new timeline so they can keep going with all these characters that you love and, you know, history that you know. And I'd really like to see, you know, even them do like a comic series or new series, you know, involving the Star Trek online universe or maybe the stuff that happened in between. Who knows? Anything's possible. Cause I love it and even, and they've, they've incorporated some of the enterprise stuff in there too. You know, even though I think it's kind of crappy, but um, it's, I've been very, very happy with Star Trek online, but like I said, I'm giving world of war crack a try. Um, I like my goat girl. She's dressed like a hoochie right now, but she can burn things. There you go. I do like, and I think this is new, the arcane missile thing. It's not new, but you, it's new for me. They, everything is at different levels now, so you might be getting it sooner than you would have before. Cause they rearranged everything when they did cataclysm and like some people get talents at a really early level that they wouldn't have seen till like level 40 before this. This arcane missile thing, they're just like, here, have this for free. What? And you don't have to, it's just random. You can randomly cast it and it doesn't cost anything and it's instant and you can kill lots of stuff with it. If you're thinking you specced for it somehow, so that's kinda, yeah, usually those free things are usually some type of speccing, but yeah, that's spending talent points. You spent your talent points. I had it before I got my talent points and then, so I don't play a mage, so I have no idea how it works. And then I'll double check my stuff real quick cause it's not going to screw up the show or anything, but it's like, well, I did pick arcane path, but I had everything before that. I think it's important for, I mean, I don't want to veer off the path too much and talk to my pet. I don't know how to get it. But I do think it's important for wow veterans to hear how newbies approach wow, because I think sometimes the wow veterans just assume people come into wow and they know everything and it's, it's hard. There's a lot to the game. So I think it's important that, you know, if you're a veteran of wow, you sometimes kind of hear what the new people are really thinking and some of the challenges and so forth. I'm not exactly new, but I didn't, but going on a hiatus, as long as you have with all the changes, it's, it's new to you. That's about an average though, every time I've gone on hiatus, I've taken about a year off. You know, I think last time I played was in February and then I quit when Star Trek online came out. So I think I actually just paid for another month so that a TR could get a free month. Nice. Which I'm very sorry that didn't work out for you. I thought that I could use another scroll, but they said, yeah, it's only one for account ever. I'm sorry. Uh, let me look at chat room really quick. Cause we want to get some questions out chat.orangelaunchradio.com a quick question from break man. Are the star Trek cartoons canon? Yes, actually. Um, the animated series is considered canon. All right. Uh, break man is also asking, do newbies still have to go find that wife in the barons? I don't think so. I don't play horde, so I'm not sure. Uh, but I believe due to the stupid mushrooms due to the shift, the mushrooms due to the shift of a burning crusade, or I'm sorry, due to the shift of, of Southern barons being its own zone. I don't believe that quest is there anymore. Stupid, stupid mushrooms. See that hasn't changed, but you'll get there. You'll get there. Yeah. And then someone had to start in badger badger, Rob. All right. I was already in my head. Let's move on. Loki, is there any games you've been playing? I know you don't play any MMOs right now. So what, what have you been up to? Um, I've been just playing grand theft auto and um, swords and poker or sword and poker too. I'm playing lots of sword and poker too. And I did actually play a little bit of, now it's a little confusing because I have both Tron games. I have the Tron legacy game and then also the Tron game, but I played Tron legacy a little bit and it's, it's all right if you, um, you race around in light cycles and um, the recognizers. Yeah, I just don't like tilt steering. I hate tilt steering and everything. It's just, it's not, it doesn't feel natural. So you must be playing it on PS3 with the six axis or what? No on the iPod. Oh, okay. I thought these were the retail games. No, no, no, no. Um, no, it's just a tilt steering on the iPod to steer the bike. I hate that. Oh, okay. Got it. I prefer like, you know, my finger, um, yeah, that's pretty much it. I think I didn't play a whole lot. It's too busy yelling at Comcast. Oh, the internet's been down for still right. You were down last week and you're still down, right? They're dumb. Okay. They're dumb. We'll just put it that way. And no Comcast really doesn't care despite the fact, you know what certain Twitter people will say, um, and how they may seem concerned and ask you to email them and then they don't give a shit once you've emailed them. So you mad? Just slightly canceling TV with them actually because I'm pretty pissed off and it's not working all the way too because I can't use any of the on-demand stuff because the signal's not strong enough. That sucks. Sorry to hear it. Thankfully, thank you to my new Virgin mobile phone though that I have rooted. I can now tie into the Wi-Fi and that's a connected 3G network. So that has been a lifesaver I tell you. There you go. My gaming week has been mostly dominated with World of Warcraft cataclysm. I won't kind of go all the way back into it, but I hit level 85, which is the new max level this week, so shut. So that's good. I've been just trying to gear for heroics and I am geared for heroics now, so I'll be doing that soon. As far as other games go, not anything new, just some of the same old standbys like Rock Band 3, Super Meat Boy, and some of those games I've just been playing gradually over the past month, but not a whole lot. As you know, with the holidays coming up and everything, my gaming time has been kind of thin. But the good news is, with the huge break coming up, I don't know about some of you out there, but I have been given at work basically the entire time between Christmas and New Year's off. Our company does this whole closure thing where we have to take time off basically, which is, you know, I'm not gonna lie, I kind of welcome it, so it's gonna be a nice break. But I don't know what to do with myself for like nine days off in a row. I can't really afford to take any major trips right now, so I guess I'll sit at home and play some games. So that's good though, because I really need to just catch up on some things. So hopefully I'll get some gift cards for Christmas or something, I can go buy myself a couple new games, and beat them! That'd be great. So anyway, that does it for our gaming week. I hope you guys are having a lot of fun this week, and for the holidays, some of you guys get some new games that you can play through. You have to tell us all about it at chat.orangelauncheradio.com. Ziba in the chatroom says, my job does the same thing. It's not totally unheard of. DarkCircuitry in the chatroom says, internet equals Warcraft equals Rob's life at least. Not totally. I mean, yeah, I spend a lot of my free time playing Warcraft, but let's not forget, it just had a major expansion. It's third expansion just came out like last week, so of course, you know, that's kind of the focus right now, but you know, that'll die down once I've really experienced a lot of the new stuff. I don't really plan on rolling an alt or getting through all that and all that, so I'll have time to play a new game. And yes, I know how to go outdoors, I was in the city all weekend, so I do more than just sit on the computer and play WoW, but that is a lot of what I do, it's fun. Alright, anyhow, housekeeping, there is no show next week. We will not be having a show on the 26th due to the holidays, DarkCircuitry's gonna be out of town. Where are you going? You're going way up. Going to Washington. Washington, Washington! But not Seattle, right? You're going to... No, I'm going to Prosser. Which is more in the middle of nowhere or is it kind of a big city? Yeah. Okay, well... It's teeny. Very farmy. Have fun in the farm town. I'm growing in my netbook. There you go. Stay connected. And yeah, we'll just, you know, Loki and I will just be taking some time off for the holidays so we won't be here, but we will be back the week after in the new year with a new show. Otherwise, if you want to follow us on Twitter for all the updates about our show, twitter.com slash o-l-r, we'll also be taking your Twitter topics there, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio as well. More comments from our chat room, chat dot orange lounge radio dot com. Tiger Claw says, Sky will just play Cataclysm for nine days. No, I'm not going to play for nine days straight. I'm not going to lie, I'm going to play a lot with the time off, I'm not going to play the whole time, come on. Besides, I have Knights of the Clicky on Facebook I've got to be playing too. Someone sent me an invite to that, no thanks. It's a real time waster. Jim Sally in our chat room says, if you're bored next week, Rob, do a show every day. There's three hours taken care of. That'd be kind of fun, but I don't know, I think I'd run out of things to talk about and then we get kind of scary. Would the listeners help me do a show? I don't know. I'm talking about all the stuff coming out, oh, wait, no, no. There's already a bunch of live shows at All Games Radio where we do our show and obviously we wouldn't want to bump any of those shows, we don't have the right to. There's plenty of fine shows on the network, so let them do their thing and we'll see. William Murderface in our chat room says, I love that name by the way, Rob, you need a drunken Rocky marathon. I don't know, I've been doing Rocky for so long now, I don't think I need to marathon it. There you go. And JV Monner in our chat room says, oh yeah, more people need to play Pinball FX2. Agreed. Pinball FX2 is great. Chat.orangeloungeradio.com. Let's go to some gaming news. Believe it or not, there is still some going on this week, even though it is the holiday period. Loki. Yes, so apparently Microsoft is wanting, obviously, to improve upon what they've already created. They want to quadruple the Kinect's accuracy, and the way they're going to do that is by unrestricted the camera from the 320 by 240 pixel resolution to unlock it to 640 by 480, and unfortunately they can't do that right now because of the limitations put on by the console's USB controller interface, which has to keep open enough to support other USB based peripherals like batteries and rechargers, but if they somehow enable it to where, you know, they would limit you to so many devices or whatever plugged in via USB, then they would be able to unlock the bandwidth to be able to stream more data from the Kinect and allowing you to basically quadruple the resolution of the camera, so it'd be able to detect, they said, even like finger movements and stuff like that, that can't be done right now. So that's kind of cool, and they said that can all be accomplished with a firmware update, so that is kind of cool and kind of makes you wonder why it wasn't there in the first place. Well, they said right there it's because of the limitations of the console, because right now they have to, you know, they have to play nice with all the other peripherals on there. I don't under, well, I mean, I guess the USB controller, so I was gonna say I don't understand why they couldn't just unrestricted the one port for the Kinect, but I don't know, it would be difficult to do that. As long as whatever they do doesn't impact the older consoles, like, that's my fear, is that, you know, as they keep talking about, we're gonna upgrade all this stuff for firmware, we're gonna do all these upgrades, oh, but if you have the old white Xboxes, then you're fucked. Well, all you need is... It's only gonna work with the 360Ss. You just need the adapter that comes with it, but I think that's just, that's just for power. I mean, they had the data, they just had more power coming through there. I guess what they could do is say, okay, you know, when running the Kinect, you can only hook up, like, you know, one device or two devices or something like that. Maybe that's the way they could get around it, or, I don't know. It's a little tricky, but I could see them doing it, especially if it's gonna make things that much better. But at the same time, we really need the games to be four times better anyways. At least, you know, some of them. Well, I'm not convinced, I'm not convinced that even if you make the technology better, that there's enough games with really new ideas there yet to substantiate it, if that makes sense? Yeah. Like, you know, Dance Central is awesome, but, you know, as far as a lot of those other adventures and those sorts of games go, the fitness games, I'm kind of over it. Like, you know, show me how Kinect is going to make my life as a gamer even more awesomer, and yes, that's a term, more awesomer. You know, show me how Kinect's gonna do that. Kinect is still kind of a flashy thing right now. I haven't seen it really truly integrated into the hardcore games that I'm used to. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean. So at one point, I'm kind of like, don't waste your time with this upgrade to the technology unless you have the games to kind of back that up that aren't just more exercise games and more dance games. Well, I think they're just working on, you know, having that available for when they do get to that point as far as game development goes, because yeah, some of the stuff that is available right now, it's very basic with what they have you doing. You know, Dance Central's a pretty good example of what it can do, but some other games that kind of just have these modes tacked on like Harry Potter and stuff where it's just an on rails thing that you, it's very unnecessary. I mean, I don't know. They need less like, you know, fitness games, less snowboarding-esque games, just some better ideas. Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. Derek H. wants to give a cheap plug to connectable.net. Games are only scratching the surface. You know, that's a good thought. I'm looking at some of the stuff here that they have, and of course I've been kind of reading about the hacks on the internet, and this website connectable.net seems to be kind of a collection of the different sorts of hacks that are out there, like lots of YouTubes, and I'm seeing things like an air piano where you can use your hand to play the piano on connectable. I mean, it's not exactly like a real piano, but still it's an impressive little thing that they're doing with the technology. You gotta wonder if Microsoft's kind of letting this hack thing go a little bit just to see what people are coming up with so they can steal it. You know what I want? Hmm? The Kinect experiment. No, seriously, this is me being serious, because I really want a Theremin. Maybe Kinect music. Why not? Since there was Wii music, let's have Kinect music. And actually have it be good? Perhaps. Let's not, because once again we've figured out that, you know, porting stuff over from the Wii or, you know, basically copying the ideas that you've done on the Wii, not exactly a great plan, because then a lot of these games just come out very cheesy. I mean, even some of the games are just, I mean, like Deca Sports and Game Party, I mean, it's just, that's stuff that they have on the Wii right now. We don't need a, you know, ton of mini game collections and little sports compilations and stuff like that. Just come up with something, something cool, you know? And something, something that doesn't even necessarily need to use your whole body, like head tracking in a first person shooter would be pretty awesome. That would be actually really awesome. You know, it's completely optional. Like to duck? You have to duck. And you should like do that on your couch. No, not even. That's, that's dumb. Really? Not even the ducking thing. But I'm saying like, you could poke your head a little bit to the side to kind of get a different perspective. It's just a little bit more immersive. Wouldn't take that much, you know, technology. And you know... Could you imagine time crisis done with head tracking? It would be cool, but I'm kind of sick of time crisis. I mean, I'm just saying, I'm taking that concept to where, you know, say that you duck under, you know, a divider and you can peek over it and that type of thing. But I'm just trying to think of a solution for like, you know, people that want to play with controllers on a, you know, on a couch or something like that. And they can make everything very minimal and optional. I mean, you don't have to have, say like for the next Gears of War game or something like that, could have head tracking. And that would be the extent of the Kinect support. None of this, move your arm in like a karate chop to cut through, you know, enemy. I don't know. Here's a really interesting comment from chat from chat.orangelodgevideo.com. Ray Craft says, time crisis with head tracking. Yeah, that's called Police 911. Very interesting comment because yeah, Police 911 used a dance games technology. It was basically Para Para Paradise, you know, the setup to kind of do this different sort of game. What was mocap? All the like mocap boxing and all that. Yeah, the whole mocap thing. That was the same theory, but I'm saying that now with the Kinect, something like that is actually really possible. Sure. Just like, you know, Para Para is possible in the home, but that's, that's that dance masters game. Which I need to get. Yeah. Cause I, Oh, I forgot to mention that for my thing, but I got to connect for December ween. Congrats. Yay. All right. For Festivus? December ween. Is that what you call it? I'm going to call it December ween. December ween. Awesome. All right. Chat.orangelodgevideo.com. If you want to lend your own comments, lots of comments there, just kind of, um, on that story. I like that. Well, let's go back to talking about wow for a minute. Sorry guys. But you know, I know some of you are wow haters and that's fine. People are going to like what they like, but you can't ignore this world of Warcraft shatters a record this week yet again, and probably to no one's surprise cataclysm is sold 3.3 million units within 24 hours of its release becoming the fastest selling PC game of all time. The game that it beat of course was Wrath of the Lich King World of Warcraft 2.8 million copies back in 2008. They didn't say how much of that 3.3 million was digital. This was of course the first expansion that Blizzard had launched digitally, which was a little bit of a controversy in some ways because, uh, you know, all those midnight launches certainly had a few less people at them due to the digital launch. But what I think is very interesting about this is I think it shows you that of those 12 million subscribers or whatever, 3.3 million are pretty hardcore because they all had to have the game the first day and I totally admit that I fall into that category. But it's left a lot of people asking like, well, where does the other 9 million go? And I'm wondering, well, has cataclysm launched in every country? But certainly there's a gap there and I think that's only day one, I think too. I mean, some people, you know, couldn't make it over the day or waited a little bit or they're getting it as a gift. And I think some people are honestly having to wait like a month because, you know, the economy the way it is, I know there's certain people in my guild that are like, uh, not going to be doing cataclysm until the new year at least because just can't afford it. It's too much. So, you know, I think there's a lot of people that just don't do it. Or is cataclysm like a lot of that stuff like end game because I could see maybe some people just starting off, they're saying, eh, I don't need it. A lot of it is because the stuff that affected the pre-end game, you know, the zero to 60 experience, you don't need this expansion to experience any of that. That was all a free upgrade basically because they destroyed the old world and ushered in this new one. However, the whole Worgen and Goblin experience, which are really well done starting areas just as far as like immersing in story and everything, you can't do unless you have cataclysm. So you can't do those new races, but you know, you can still roll a Draenei like Dark Soccer is and at level 15 or whatever, head over to the other continent and experience some of the cataclysm stuff without really needing the cataclysm expansion. So kind of interesting. Other important news out of Blizzard and this isn't about WoW, but this could be about what ends up killing WoW. That's right. Blizzard might actually be making the game that is going to kill WoW. They're making their own WoW killer. Frank Pierce in an interview with Destructoid confirmed that the earlier rumor was true that the next MMO that they are making is called Titan. At least right now that's a code name. That doesn't mean that's the finalized release name of the game. That's just the code name. So it also kind of lends a little credit to the fact that that leaked list might have been true. I don't remember if we talked about that leaked list on this show or if that was on Hoardhouse because it's a little more Blizzard centric, but all I can say is that if you've seen that leaked list of release dates and names and so forth, all that shit is subject to change because Blizzard is notorious for saying, we will put it out when it's ready and not a minute before. So you know, take a lot of that with a grain of salt. Anyhow, more quote here in the interview with Destructoid, quote, the media is not supposed to know anything about Titan. It's our next gen MMO and we've only started, excuse me, we've only started talking about it in a limited fashion because we want to leverage the fact that we're working on something like that for the purpose of recruiting, getting some of the best talent of the industry on the product, on the project. So they are up to something, but that something is at least a good three years away, if not more. So enjoy WoW in the meantime. Otherwise, I'm kind of curious as to what this is, but they probably won't even do an announcement until like Blizzcon 2012 or something. It's a ways out there guys. But it's interesting to know that that part of the rumor was true because I think I passed it off on a Hoard House's fan wank. So sometimes I can be wrong about things. DarkSakura, what do you got for us? Pac-Man Fever. Nah. You remember that song, don't you? That's old school. Yes, I do. Of course I remember that song. Well, so do the folks, um. That song's older than most of our listeners, you know. Well, so the folks at Rock Band, they remember it and actually it came out the same year as Tron. Awesome. Ooh. So the Pac-Man Fever album will be on Rock Band Download Content. And that's supposed to be early 2001 and it will have, as I said, Pac-Man Fever and Do the Donkey Kong and Froggy's Lament. Just so you guys know, these songs were actually kind of terrible. Like- But pull up Pac-Man Fever. Here. Like, you know. But it was, it was popular when it came out, I mean. I remember skating at the roller rate to this song. So do I. I'm totally dating myself, but. This song was really just written, this whole album was just a little like video game tie in song. It was really just written to cash in on the whole craze. One hit Wonderband. You don't want me to find the 7up commercial. I've shown you the 7up commercial. I think, yes, a long time ago on this show, yes. Um, but yeah, it's coming out. I get it. I wouldn't mind having some Pac-Man Fever. It'd be that lol song you pull up at parties. You know, everybody has the lol songs for Rock Band. Like the Cartman version of Poker Face is always a good lol song. You know, I didn't download that. I vetoed that. Really? So, but you know what my song is? Uh, Still Alive from Portal. No, Skullcrusher Mountain. Oh, okay. That's a good lol song. That's a good one. Skullcrusher Mountain. Alright. So there you go. Uh, what? The other songs on the album sound kind of funny. I haven't really heard any of those other ones. It's been ages since I've listened to any of the other ones. I actually did have that on vinyl back in the day. Wow. That's a collector's note. Hold on. Let me pull it up here so you can hear a little bit here. If you want to. Here's a little bit of Do the Donkey Kong. If you want to know what this song is about. I got Pac-Man Fever. Alright. There you go. Um, so when the whole ESPN streaming was announced for, or I should say when it came out as part of the November dashboard update for the Xbox 360, um, some people unfortunately were unable to participate in that streaming and those would be folks that had Bright House, which is owned by Time Warner, as their cable provider. Unfortunately those people were unable to actually get the ESPN app to work correctly. But now it says apparently that this is going to be coming to those people that were unable to have it before, and this is coming from the ESPN website. The way it works, I guess, is when a Time Warner or Bright House user turns on their Xbox 360 and tries to access the ESPN app, it'll direct them to the ESPN activation page where they have to authenticate their account with Bright House or Time Warner. Then it'll be given an access code. Once you have that, you would, um, I guess you're gonna be able to actually use the streaming service now. So that's kinda neat, that they're not locked out of it anymore. Guess some money exchanged hands or something like that. I always thought it was interesting that, like, whenever I would connect to the ESPN live thing, and granted I don't, like, Uber, follow sports and all that, although I won tickets to a Kings game at work, and, like, I'm gonna be, like, right in the front of a section. I'm excited, actually, even though I don't, you know, it's like the two worst teams in the league playing each other. But I don't care! I'm gonna have fun. So the ESPN thing for, like, when I get my once-in-a-great-while basketball thing, I've looked at it, like, once or twice, I always thought it was kinda weird that, like, the whole Comcast logo was in the corner, I'm like, it knows. It's aware. I mean, I know it's just reading my IP, and so it can tell, and, you know, probably the gateway I'm going through and what have you, but it always kinda struck me as interesting. I don't know. I don't know if I wanna open this can of worms and make me sound even more ignorant, but whatever. I've gotta ask this question. Is the reason how Time Warner and all these companies are able to block this because of the fact that net neutrality didn't actually work out or was, like, they found that it's not in the courts or whatever, that it's not actually exist, that net neutrality shouldn't exist? Well, how can Time Warner block this when it's on the internet? You know what I mean? It's just, it's just like how, you know, they go in the squabbles with, you know, um, like Fox or whatever, all of a sudden blacked out on a certain cable provider because they don't wanna pay certain royalties or whatever, so it may have been that these, like, Time Warner Bright House didn't wanna, you know, pay ESPN or whatever, or something to that effect, I'm thinking. That's right, but that's also not the internet, that's TV, so I was always, it always kind of fascinated me. But it's TV content, though, I don't know how that exactly works with, like, streaming on the web and stuff like that, and if you can get to it, because I know, like, some places you can't, um, you can't stream, like, certain games on, um, the web, you know, depending on your location or something like that, because of blackouts and... If you're a Time Warner user, would you be able to get around this just by spoofing your IP? Maybe? I'm not sure. I bet there's websites out of there with more devious information than things I've read. But you know what, I'm not really gonna pay attention to this whole streaming app until they have ESPN 8, the Ocho, with all sorts of extreme sports and dodgeball. Now, actually, I did try to watch, remember when dodgeball came out and stuff, and then shortly after that they actually did have dodgeball on, like, one of the ESPNs or Spike or something like that? That's right, they did, they did. It was boring. It goes to show you, it's just a movie. It's not exciting in real life. But it's an awesome 8-bit NES video game, just so you know. That's true. And a Game Boy Advance launch title. It's just like if someone, you know, if for whatever reason they decide, hey, you know what, it'd be awesome if we have some people running around in an arena throwing Frisbees with little lights on the outside of them and playing tag, you know, um, kind of like Tron, but, you know, Disc Wars and stuff like that, that would not be fun to watch more than once. Uh, Jvmon in our chat room asks, but Sky, why would you go out of your way to do that for ESPN? If you're that into ESPN, you probably already have all their channels. True, but I'm going by that hacker mentality of, because I can, and I'm not gonna be told no. I mean, isn't that kind of why people install Linux on toasters, because they can, you know? And you can't is not a suitable answer. I consider that as, I'm a power user, so, you know, if I want Linux to be on my toast, then that'd be kind of cool to put Linux on a toaster and then have it print stuff on your toast, if that were possible. They make a coffee printer. Coffee printer? That? Oh, that does, yeah, I know what you're talking about. Uh, Derek H. in our chat room tries to clarify, kind of cheating though, Derek H. in our chat room tries to clarify and break things down for me a little bit. ESPN3 is a paid service that the ISP has to buy. So spoofing your IP won't matter because the content can't get through the Time Warner routers. That's still disappointing. I mean, I kind of thought once content was on the internet, everybody was supposed to get it. I mean, I, I get it now. I get the reasons why it doesn't work, but it sucks. Anyhow, uh, JV Mon also, I'm sorry, Rama in our chat room says, Sky getting into ESPN, he loses 20 gay points. Hey, hey, hey, hey, there's lots of gay guys that are into sports. In fact, I'm actually taking, one of my best friends, I'm taking to this game with me because he likes sports a lot and he likes basketballs and he happens to be to gay. So there you go. Anyhow, let's move on. More news going on. PlayStation app on the iPhone, not here yet, but here's the deal. A PlayStation app has been announced for phones. It's Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is releasing this, the official PlayStation app in Europe. Uh, you're going to be doing some PlayStation network interaction through your iPhone or Android device. Let me think, could that be buying games and spending money and my points through the phone? That's gotta be one of it, right? Yeah, you're not going to be playing games on this, but you can look at trophies and you can look and see if your friends are on or offline or what have you, and you can also see the official blog, at least in Europe, because this is being released as a Europe product. It is coming out soon in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. There are more countries set to be added to that list, but no word if the US is one of them, but I would think so. I mean, how could it not be? One would hope so. I would certainly think so. And again, we are sort of the redheaded stepchild of the world. Well it is, it is interesting that with all these rumors we've had lately of the Sony phone and the photos of it in action and all that, that they are acknowledging at least that, you know, the iPhone still has a huge ass market share, so they ought to put something official on it. No, they need to stop wasting their time with this crap and actually deliver on the stuff that they promised us way back in the day before all this stuff was coming out. Like for example, we would have trophy rooms in home where we can show off our trophies and they would be really cool interactive things and people could walk through and do that. It's still not there. What the hell? Come on. Do what you promised and stop wasting the damn time. Loki's a little bitter. I know a little bit. No, not that it matters. I would never go in the home again anyways because it's a waste of time. I'll bag on Apple for a little bit for a minute though. There is so much. That's why Game Center sucks because there's so much trash out there in the app store, especially stuff that is free. Like I kid you not, I downloaded a free app the other day and the game itself is all right, but if you want to unlock, here's how you get quote unquote achievements in Game Center. You can get 50 points of achievements for emailing a friend about the game. You can get another like 75 points for posting to your Facebook wall about the game and like all these things that have nothing to do with actually playing the game itself and I just think there needs to be some type of quality control. Like I feel like Microsoft's put a little bit more quality control in achievements. Granted there's some pretty asinine achievements out there too and some of them have to do with, you know, download content and things like that, but I don't know. I just look at Game Center and I go, sometimes leaving this stuff wide open is a little too open, but maybe that's just me. Sometimes I just go lolz. Going back to ESPN3 for a little bit because I find this conversation in our chatroom humorous at chat.orangelaungerated.com, Derek H says, oh my God, I'm checking out ESPN3 right now. World badminton championships, enough said, but I like Brakeman's follow up. They could have at least called it the shuttlecock tournament. Nice. There you go. Chat.orangelaungerated.com if you want to chat with these folks. Shuttlecock. I know, right? Well how about something that has nothing to do with cocks? Boring. Alright, no, we can do it. Well, there's been a call to ban Mafia 2 by the daughter of a Sicilian journalist who was murdered by the Mafia. Well, the journalist was murdered, of course not she was. Her name is Sonia Alfano. She is a member of the European Parliament and President of Italy's Association for the Family of Mafia Victims and I think she's, basically she's still grieving. You know, it happened in 93. Her father, Bepe, was murdered in January in 93. She's saying that basically it's taking the Mafia from, you know, killing and death into fun times. And 2K, I'm sorry, Take Two. It's that whole glamorizing violence thing. Yeah, that's it. And she's trying to get the European Commission to consider banning it. Take Two is like, uh, no. Basically it's dealing with the American Mafia. You know, sort of like the Godfather and Sopranos, that type of thing. And then they, you know, we're, you know, trying to make it sort of a more realistic type thing yet still be entertaining, not necessarily to glorify the violence in real life things, but to take the sort of, uh, fictional world of it. To take the fictional world of it, not necessarily glamorize it. Well, I, I, here's the funny thing. I do, obviously, I think this is a little bit too much. You don't ban an entire video game just because something unfortunate happened. And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to disrespect what happened. That's terrible that, you know, she lost her father in a crime like that so many years ago. I imagine that's something that you never get over, even though it's like 17 years later. However, it's letting one bad apple ruin the barrel, so to speak. At the same time, though, Take Two's argument of, well, it's not the European Mafia. It's the American Mafia. Okay, that's, that's, I don't think that's specifically their argument, just that they're saying that it set, you know, the whole Godfather Sopranos slash kind of thing. I, but I seriously don't think that makes it any better for this woman. However, if somebody's going to do something stupid, they're going to do something stupid. They don't need a video game to teach them how to do it. It's funny. I don't know why I'm reminded of this completely random conversation I was having last night on the train, but Alan and I took BART into the city to go to the Metronon to see Tron, right? And while we were going down into the BART tunnel, I was commenting, wow, I have, I have 3G signal in here. I haven't had 3G signal in BART tunnel. I don't remember when. They must have put a tower down here, right? And he said, yeah, I think, I think they put a cell tower down in the BART stations a couple of years ago. You know, so people could still use their phone when they're down here. But it met with a lot of resistance for a while. They didn't want to put it in. I was like, oh, is that just San Francisco being hippies again? They don't want more cell towers. No, apparently it had to do with the fact that when the UK bombings happened back in oh, four, oh, five, sorry if I'm misstating that, but back when those happened, when those buses went off, that was all triggered via Internet and Wi-Fi or what have you, wireless signals. And so they didn't want something similar happening in the San Francisco BART tunnels. But I said, well, wait a minute. You know, obviously, you know, we're not arguing. He's just telling me the fact of the matter. But my response is, wait a minute, like, if somebody is going to do something stupid, they don't need 3G signal in order to be able to do it or not. Well, this is my thing, too, you know, like, my granddaddy died of cancer. I don't have a problem with house. Must be lupus. That's the only house joke I know. I don't even watch the show, but I know there's a joke about lupus. But they also, I've just picked something hospital related, so. Right. I don't have problems, okay. I don't have problems with people that smoke other than that they usually stink. But that's how my granddaddy got cancer. Here's the other thing I think this gal needs to take into consideration is that, you know, if she's upset about this Mafia video game, is she upset at the movie that comes out once every three months, at least, that also glamorizes the Mafia and the crime and all that stuff because there's an awful lot of movies. What about books? There's a lot of books. The Godfather was a book. Honestly, I think she's sensitive. She has a right to be sensitive. I understand she's sensitive, but at the same time, you don't take that out on everybody else. Yeah. You don't ban a game from an entire country because you have that whole response to it. I think that it's people taking their personal, you know, honestly, this goes back to one of the biggest things that I think is wrong with the world in general. It goes back to that, it's very selfish, I think, you know, and I'm not trying to belittle her grief. Exactly. But it's like, you know, especially with the whole political correctness thing, you know. People spend so many times because one or two people are offended for something, but not the entire population. You know? Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeonshreddy.com, Frisbee says, remember, 3G and Wi-Fi didn't cause those buses to explode, explosives did. Yeah, that was kind of my point, too. Jvmon in our chatroom says, does that mean Facebook will be taking off Mafia wars? William Murderface says, is she mad at Jersey Shore for making Italians look like asses? That's a whole nother topic. This is my thing, okay, for example, and I actually get a lot of this living in California, I'm trying to pick something neutral and something light. I get the whole, oh, Alabama's full of rednecks thing, which I know for a fact it's not. I'm from there. Am I a redneck? Well. Rob. You do get awfully excited over Chick-fil-A. Oh, God. Well, Chick-fil-A's delicious, but I mean. I'm kidding, by the way. I know. I just wrote three emails down. It's fine. But I mean, you know, a lot of people in the South are uber conservative, bush-loving, you know, gun-toting rednecks. I mean, the stereotypes exist for a reason. However, I don't get offended because I know they're not talking about me. Now, if they said all people from Alabama are freakin' rednecks and all that, I'd be like, you know what? That's not true. allow me to educate you but you know weren't you raised by lesbians who live in Alabama yes not your mother but you know your your pseudo mothers for a couple years when you were out of high school right yes I was so and you know when I think of Alabama I don't think of that's the place where all the lesbians go I think of Santa Cruz but I'm saying that people and I understand the concept behind wanting to make things better for other people wanting to try to decrease opportunity for hate if that makes sense Rob mm-hmm but at the same time I think that people are a little too sensitive I really like this comment and I think this is a good one to end it on and move on to another story break man in our chat room says people have the right to their opinions but they don't have the right to enforce their opinions on others well said that's it chat I think the world just needs to be a little thicker skinned chat orange lounge radio.com or you can always email us if you have an opinion on that mail bag at orange lounge radio.com I'd actually be really curious about this and and this might be a dangerous place to go but that's okay we'll be a little bit dangerous here on olr I kind of want to know if there's a game out there that has ever made someone like that has ever kind of offended someone in this similar type of manner and I'm not necessarily like I don't I don't want to hear you're really like you know upsetting story about something that happened in the family or whatever but is there have been something in a video game where you were just kind of like you know what they really shouldn't have done that I'm just kind of curious if people can think of a case like that and email it to us mailbag at orange lounge radio.com there's a world war two games and you're out there killing Nazis mm-hmm and yeah everything they did was really crappy but that's the past we learned from it mm-hmm we move forward mm-hmm you know and I mean I'm saying that now we should you know know what the warning signs are know what to stop you know there should be no legislation that forces you know one you know person you know it's something different when it's a something that's beyond your control you know now that now that we can learn from history I think that that's one thing but I think that people do need to understand that there's just assholes in the world and people are haters gonna hate right exactly it's my favorite just gotta just gotta be a little bit better than them but you know ready to put the stop when it actually is something that you can do something about you can't change minds you can't change the way people feel but you can change how you respond to it all right it's some kind of a comment here along those lines from Derek H in our chat room says I did not like the airport scene in Call of Duty 4 at all I thought it was really fucked up and had no reason being there chat dot orange roger dot com or a mailbag may I was really offended one rockstar games decided hey you know what for the Ballad of Gay Tony we're gonna make all the deathmatch multiplayer into smaller close-knit let locations instead of the open-world grand theft auto oops drop my iPad or iPod um close-knit deathmatch locations and not the big old expansive open-world stuff that was very offensive to me I'm not sure we're on the same page Loki not sure you're quite the same thing out of this topic all right anyhow let's move on some more games are coming out and I don't know if there's anything offensive I mean it's the holiday week after all but let's travel the world and see what releases are coming out we'll start with the u.s. um not a whole lot coming out this week mostly download stuff actually I shouldn't say mostly all of it download

is the first expansion for Nobunaga I know they have Nobunaga's like they turn Nobunaga's ambition into like an online game now so I'm not sure if this is the online game itself I thought that had already come out or if this is like the first expansion but that is coming out in Japan on the 22nd unfortunately the description is in Japanese so I can't read if that's a regular one or expansion also coming out on the 23rd of December Mugen Cairo Hikari tokage no hako comes out as well in Japan and this looks like echo it's echo chrome 2 that's what this game is like it's it looks like echo chrome but with colors and sure enough it is echo chrome 2 not a download title that is actually gonna be out there it supports PlayStation move that is coming out of the 23rd going to the we in Japan Momochan diet we figure o bix by John Dion comes out this week on the 23rd yeah it's another diet game but get this you have to see the box art for this game I'm just gonna copy that little picture and I'm gonna post that in our chat room and you kids tell me if you're gonna buy that fitness game based on the artwork or not Loki what do you think what is this fitness game have in the box art that most fitness games don't usually have hot Asian chick on the front that's right in a bikini nonetheless and she's not only in a bikini she's kind of peeling down the bottom of her bikini yeah you know what what a hoe Jillian Michaels tried that on the cover her game and I'm sorry not the same effect it's not the same like no I don't want to see your penis it is not this is not the same all right also milestone shooting collection 2 comes out on the way but who cares you're all going to be looking at your unopened boxes of Momochan diet on the DS not a lot this week there really isn't anything but we do get to saga three she could know Hasha shadow or light comes out on January 6 I believe this is another game in the saga series like it's a remake of one of the saga games which was what Final Fantasy legend here so that's kind of cool lastly going to the PSP beyond the Milky Way comes out this week on the PSP as well as starry sky in autumn and a big release this week the third birthday that doesn't sound familiar to you that's the new parasite Eve game coming on PSP the third birthday this week so there'll be a lot of folks importing that one that's probably the biggest release of them all over to the UK Dark Sakura well as for our UK news we have a bare few things not like the bare necessities or anything on the 21st we have the battlefield bad company to Vietnam 22nd back to the future on the 29th rascals and also on the 34 I'll go ahead mention the 31st we have EA Sports Grand Slam tennis because kids like tennis and that's it all right that's gonna do it for the release dates this week let's go back into some news and we have the classic game of the week just a few minutes ahead of us but first a story from Loki yes let's see this is kind of neat now you may remember that they just released the pretty awesome infinity blade on the iPhone and iOS App Store well there's gonna be other games supporting the unreal development kit and it's kind of cool one of the demos that they're showing off the unreal development kit for was none other than the long hopefully not forgotten epic game just jackrabbit but now updated in 3d graphics and fun stuff like that there's actually some other epic whatever unreal engine games that are coming to the store in fact I think there's actually one and I don't remember what it was called but it was I kind of looked a little bit like World of Warcraft on but it was like a tower defense game or something like that we're like a hack and slash game with the name dungeon in the title I don't remember exactly what it was but it looked pretty cool so but yeah I mean more games supporting the unreal engine would be pretty awesome because they can do some pretty sweet looking stuff just even up with the limited resources of the iOS and the iPhones and stuff like that just like when I hear that there might be a new jazz jackrabbit or whatever I'm like oh my god is it 1994 this is great yeah that's awesome something else that is new and exciting I guess depends what kind of games you play sing star yeah I remember seeing star the karaoke games it's also a dance game I played your Abba yeah sing star you shouldn't tell everybody on the internet I have that but I told oh come on you said that was your reason for getting a ps3 it was I need to get sing star Queen but here's some other exciting stuff about sing star the sing star store is set to explode if you live in the u.s. here's the thing sing star is actually really big in Europe it's much bigger in Europe than it is here and there's lots and lots of downloadable songs that go to Europe but they don't come over to the u.s. but here's the deal there's been a new deal made between Sony and Universal Music meaning that the content that goes to Europe will now be coming to the u.s. as well and it all started this week 64 new songs hit the u.s. sing star store 11 of them tracks for seeing star dance these tracks cost about a buck 50 each I'm trying to see if there's any like really really big songs and here there's a shit ton of Lady Gaga songs so if you're into Lady Gaga there's quite a few songs from her first album that are there and bad romance because you know you want to make your friend sing bad romance songs from the Jackson 5 are now there take that that's that's a old-school band that I think is getting back together just like did you know that the new kids on the block and the Backstreet Boys are going out on tour together yes and I actually did see that performance speaking of it being the 90s all over again somebody asked me if I wanted to go I'm like no I don't know like no I'm not no but you can do some dancing to Tiffany I think we're alone now and aha take on me I'm sorry I still like the birthday massacre version better whatever there it is some sing star stuff for you hey let's go to the classics video games and talk about an old-school game the dark soccer thinks hey you kids ought to be playing this week the classic video game of the week dark soccer is gonna step into the vault find a game that she says hey you got two weeks cuz the holiday play this game damn it what's classic game of the week I can tell you people are gonna have a hard time finding this one space fantasy zone space fantasy zone yes not fantasy zone but space fantasy zone basically what this game is is that it is a mix of space Harrier and fantasy zone and even the music is a little remix of the things it actually with with the particular game it never came out it was never released this is a prototype oh wait a minute however however um you actually can find the the disk image online aha so the kiddies are gonna have to resort to more scandalous means to play this game I wouldn't necessarily say it's scandalous given that you know I don't really think there's any kind of restriction on it but it is really pretty it's still got the same kind of space Harrier scaling issues it's pretty minimalist but the other thing that actually I didn't really care for it too is that it is a little bit harder to hit stuff but it's still so freaking cute I mean because the game space Harrier is set in the fantasy zone you know welcome to fancy zone get ready so it takes two of the best things and just puts them together and you know your bosses are your you know some of your classic fantasy zone bosses it's just really neat and it's cute it really is just it's something for people who love space Harrier or fantasy zone I mean that was really all that it is it's it's eye candy oh and you can go into your little shops and buy stuff you've got the same you know lady from your from the shops and fantasy zone and get all kinds of goodies it's just cute I mean that's really all I can say about it and it's got the oppa oppa and his little feet sticking out going that's really it that's really all I can say about it this is a prototype it never really came out that's alright it's especially it's a special game for the holidays exactly and like I said you can you can find it online you know if you've got a week we've played it I mean I'm gonna link people here in the chat room to the little youtubes they can kind of see what this game looks like because it is key I mean it's exactly what you said it's space Harrier with fantasy zone graphics it's pretty cute and I figured since fantasy zone is my second favorite game is space Harrier is my third favorite game I have to throw the two together but you know oddly enough I wouldn't exactly I don't really classify space fantasy zone on so let's see the other reason why I'm ringing it up for the classic game is that it is you can play the whole thing it's fun it's it's you know a nice waste of time not there usually are a few issues with the disc 2 and burning so you have to be really careful when you do it but it's like see there's the wood face thing yeah I like how the bosses in this game kind of look like the bosses from the original fantasy they are the bosses yeah you know what I mean though they're in that whole 3d environment so kind of neat so I really had to had to just throw it out there you know it's a game that I think any fan of fantasy zone and space Harrier should at least give a look at now there's some listeners that aren't gonna know so I have to ask you just said your second favorite game ever is fantasy zone and your third favorite ever is space Harrier what's number one that would be the Guardian legend amen sister the Guardian legend most underrated NES game ever the game is so great great absolutely astounding it's not as good any of those games as Super Metroid but they're all still really good well that's your favorite game I know but I mean so really I know it's not an official released game and yeah I've got a few prototypes of other stuff but this is one prototype that you can get the full version of out there it's not unavailable mm-hmm you know now you can't find an official printing of it or something without spending the bucks right but still and you know there's no I don't think there's any real reason about why it wasn't released it might have been something about licensing issues mm-hmm but it's just fun and I mean it's not even really the greatest game ever but it is something that uh that's worth playing it's something that's worth checking out and at least you know watch the video it's cute all right and I I still love the PC engine well that's gonna do it for part a here at orange lounge radio but don't go anywhere guys

didn't talk about those on air yeah dark soccer got me a World of Warcraft trivia calendar cuz she knows I'm an addict and so now I have a little desk calendar for work that I can tear off each day and then like I can mark things a little post-it notes like e3 and some of the big events during the years I can see how long it is till e3 when I was working I actually had three different calendars like that on my desk I had the redneck dictionary which I just thought was funny and then I had the Yiddish word of the day and I had like another one that was oh yeah like um like random facts that they won't tell you about or something so it's pretty cool but I got Loki a family guy calendar yes thank you I'm definitely gonna put this up on my desk as all I have is was an axis game localization gave me a calendar and it's tiny and not family guy because this has quotes on it I can actually put on my my marquee speaking of World of Warcraft I guess I should take this opportunity to plug the spin-off shows we have and we're not taking the holiday off at Horde house the best little Horde house in Azeroth is the little Warcraft show that I do with my buddy extra fur and now I don't know if even dark Sakura knows this but if you want more information on a Horde house it's right there at orange lounge radio.com there's a new little sidebar that plugs the two spin-off shows so we have to give hugs and kisses to our webmaster deep man for doing that and of course I have to always give a shout out as well the VX Jason XVU does more of the tech stuff making sure the website stays up so really appreciate both of them and all they do for our website including plugging our sideshows so if you like Warcraft check out Horde house it's available in iTunes dark Sakura you do a show as well and you're running some best ofs right or not best ofs year-end specials right now right yes um we do one called comic insanity it's on infamous net that's with no I in front of the end and it's me and Mar and Marvel and Dan shadow and we talk about comics nice and we talk about a shadows a hatred of Hawk people and the love hate relationship of Mar Marvel and Matt fraction who's writing Iron Man and my cluelessness about just about anything DC comics related so all right so if you want links to those both those shows now available at orange laundry calm right on the left hand side the links to both those shows cute so awesome also remember don't mention Jeff Loeb also I want to mention this it's on orange laundry calm you may have to go into the archive a little bit to see this but

there it up there it is awesome all that information orange laundry calm of course and Tiger Claw is letting us know that oh sorry I thought that was about rebroadcast something else off chat with him offline about anyhow let's get into some rapid-fire news some quick news stories that we just don't have the full time to talk about we want to bring him to your attention on the last lucky yes so this is neat super meat boy game we've actually been talking about on the show for a few weeks now and is very awesome if you happen to have the PC version apparently they figured out a way to uncover the dev mode located in the game and of course it was discovered by the modding community and I believe it allows you to customize your game a little bit of course this is only in the PC version it gives you the keys to the kingdom as they put it and some very user-friendly tools in which a team meet created the game with including the original batch of levels and actually is kinda cool team meet the creators of the game are actually nice enough to post a few tutorial videos explaining how to access and use the tools until the you know finally get around to making a proper level creator but that's pretty awesome that you know someone figured out where the dev mode is and they went ahead and decided hey you know what we're just gonna go ahead and instead of saying no why did you do that we're gonna help people out and see how people get creative with it so that's really sweet and of course if you're a fan of dead rising to you'll be happy to know that on December 27th dead rising to case west will be coming out on xbox live arcade it's the exclusive epilogue to the game and will cost you a hundred microsoft points or ten dollars do want so that looks pretty awesome and of course they're also going to have you know the photo part of the game coming back as well for that is so nice little after Christmas gift there and then finally section 8 which was a first-person shooter came out last August or I should say August 09 that actually did ok retail and was a full price game when it came out but now for the sequel prejudice they've decided hey instead of you know charging $60 for a game we're just gonna actually put it out on xbox live arcade in the PlayStation Network as well as PC for only $15 so that's pretty awesome that they went ahead and they're gonna put out full game for the $15 and it's gonna also include a single-player campaign support for up to 32 players and online multiplayer and a new four-player co-op mode called swarm says offline players will also be able to partake in multiplayer as the game can add bots in case you don't have your friends or internet connection to play against cool and what they're saying I think the way they're going to come about making up some of the money they would have made from a retail version is they're gonna have this substantial download content so that's pretty substantial download content as opposed to like just a little bit yes alright this is a very interesting game coming to the iPad iPhone and the Macintosh it's called Hamlet the game yes that's right and Hamlet's taking out the trash only it's not really is that Hamlet 2 no that was from last action hero oh I should be or not to be I've got to be have you seen Hamlet 2 no it's the dumbest fucking movie is there still kids here I'm hoping not as the doors wide open is there still kids here I don't think so okay good it's the dumbest fucking movie ever made but it's it's like so dumb it's kind of funny so anyway I was able to but this actually is not really what you would think it is in fact there's a whole little trailer out there for the game and I kind of like it's very like stylized I like that style it's a kind of like that limbo esque thing going on there yeah it's all coming out January 2011 I'm playing the trailer here in studio it's an adventure game this does not look like Hamlet to play to me but it is based on Shakespeare's Hamlet so I have no idea how that works see now we need the disaster gay friend to show up what you're doing what what are you doing I know right apparently the rest of the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 roster has been revealed it's spoiled that is if you believe the dirty internet rumors Cienko from Darkstalkers sweet Akuma from Street Fighter Haggar from Final Fight really yes that's awesome actually Phoenix the x-men sentinel from the x-men taskmaster Avengers ish Galactus is the final boss in the fight fantastic for taskmasters be interesting so there you go apparently some other characters that were planned for the game but they didn't make it Phoenix Wright Megaman venom and Frank West were all planned for the game but it just didn't happen I'm kind of sad that Frank West won't show up that's kind of surprising but then again he's not the central character in the new game so I don't know it would have been an easy port since I you know totsunoko vs. Capcom had him but you would think right taskmaster taskmaster actually makes sense because he was a regular in a dead in the old older Deadpool comic for a while right well hey if you like RPGs and you own a PSP and you like when I say RPGs I mean like old-school RPGs then like seriously like there is an awesome incredible must-have game that was announced for the PSP this week it's going to be so awesome I can't wait like like get the dust off the PSP break them out Squeenix has announced that they are bringing Final Fantasy 4 to the PSP and this is not the 3d version that was on the DS but it's being redone in 2d with the graphics in HD allah the Final Fantasy 1 & 2 remakes but here's the thing it's not just Final Fantasy 4 it's also the after years on one disc that was the mobile game that came out on we wear and that is also being upgraded to the new treatment so that is awesome Final Fantasy 4 complete collection for the PSP was revealed by V jump magazine in Japan this week keep in mind this is only officially been announced for Japan but I can't see how this game isn't coming out over here I mean this just oh man this is just awesome so there it is it's coming out in Japan this spring probably the u.s. and what summer next holiday not soon enough there it is that's the news I got still trying to find that one cover so I can show the chat room but how about something else Final Fantasy related Rob sure Final Fantasy Tactics it's the war of on the lions was supposed to come out on September 15th but then it got delayed so dead they are giving it a release window spring 2011 for the iPhone and put some pictures up on Facebook they were plugging that at e3 this year after taking a while to get out I wonder what's going on with it but it looks cute take the time to get it right don't really something buggy that's fine by me agreed and also in this should make people pretty happy is that there's new rock band download content for Christmas it actually is a happy Christmas war is over which is a John Lennon and Yoko Ono that's pretty cool and then put out put that's wrong on Jean I think by an a and these mob by BB Bruns and very dumb long hair which is by BAP Nuren wart by worse in Helden phantasma by Linnea probito by this lit filba there jerk it out by Caesars there's a lot of a worldly music this week it sounds like yeah meet the only one I care about is the first one there's been a lot of John Lennon love and rock band three because he released one of his albums too there was also well the all the Beatles stuff got released too well sure of course there was the Beatles there was the anniversary ah that's right there was a like a re-release album that's right yeah very cool what else dream cast there's actually been a confirmation of a dream cast collection GameStop has a listing for it supposedly out of September September why I'm saying September February that sounds like a holiday month FAP timber February 15th for $30 but there's really not a whole lot saying just that there is something by the Sega marketing VP Alan Pritchard says and this is a quote we actually have a dreamcast collection coming out soon but how descriptive yeah that's a nothing PSO or GTFO right right but I'll take Space Channel 5 Space Channel 5 I like how she's okay I like just how completely emotionless she says it in the Japanese version whereas you got Apollo smile who was the most annoying person in the universe being all fabulous and everything in the u.s. one and then the Japanese only have Space Channel 5 okay by the way I just had to point this out in our chat room at chat that orange on tradie calm bochi kawa says FAP timber sounds good let's make it now so Frisbee says jerk you airy I'm trying to say September FAP timber Bob's dirty you know it wouldn't be hard to get people to participate I mean you have what you have nano Remo right the writing month where I was supposed to write a novel I mean how many people can

racers that's according to the announcement the final winner will get to join the GT Academy they will train with professional drivers at tracks around the world and join a professional racing team and I guess it's all going to be televised like a reality show so if you've ever wanted to be on a reality show and you're I don't know you're good at grand Gran Turismo 5 then go for it should be fun that's it for Twitter topics if you want to send us a tweet twitter.com slash o-l-r moving on to some other news Loki yes we were talking a little bit about the inclusion of the unreal development kit for iOS well one of the first games to take advantage of that was Infinity Blade and if any blade did pretty well with its launch it made 1.7 million dollars in four days and that's pretty good for being a six dollar game they sold it over two hundred and eighty six thousand times and it's the fastest-grossing app ever according to the website app moto wow the old record I guess was held by cut the rope which was 1 million dollars in 10 days I didn't realize cut the rope had caught on so quickly I thought cut the right I mean I've heard of cut the rope but I thought it was one of I've never played it though but I thought it was one of those games that kind of slowly grew and popular and actually I could stand to correct it apparently epic Mark rain he said that the game center numbers are being reported are quite a bit lower than the actual sales so more than 1.7 million hmm says the says I tweeted because I thought that it'd be obvious that the game center numbers are a subset of our overall sales and not the actual number but several of the reports I saw seem to be confused about that also infinity blade does not require game center you can choose to cancel and still play the game however I recommend signing up for game center Apple has done a great job yeah right I'm sorry that's where I lost him right there did you hear speaking of like failed Apple launches did you hear ping got some new additions in the last week remember paying huh well you know what ping is no whatever first off whatever happened to pooping there was that website one of our listeners made the pooping site but anyway no ping has now you can share playlists with your friends you can share playlists of songs that you know you could go and then buy on iTunes hey that's finally it's finally a feature of paying the Twitter doesn't have however insignificant it may be so you know other fun stuff infinity blades getting an update next week they're gonna be adding some new enemies to face because I think from what I heard there's only like six that you face each time play through the game and they're also going to be adding multiplayer soon which is pretty awesome and also five new weapons five new shields five new helmets a new armor set enough equipment to increase the level cap to 45 and then of course the new enemy type called the morrow fiend or marrow fiend and that's screenshots from a frickin iPhone yes it is Alex outstanding I have not I will have to show it to you you at some point we're not trying to do a radio show I'm in later I know I know I know all right during our music break after the show alright sounds good let's talk about sex now that I have your attention let's talk about this new thing that's on the thingy it's on the connect yeah here's the deal we were talking earlier about connect tax and you know you people can play the piano and and people can do you know whatever these 3d dancing and all these sorts of things that connect well it didn't take long for somebody to think of sex and it's from tricks with three X's that's tricks tricks they have built a connect based interface for a sex video game you slide your hands across computer-generated tits and computer-generated ass that's really all there is right now there's just a little floaty hand that is your hand that gets to rub some fake boobies the Kinect hardware is used plus some of the open drivers in Windows 7 is how it works and unfortunately I would play the video for you but it was removed from YouTube because some people reported it for nudity and sexual content boo ruining all our fun boo it's just like all the other sex games that they have out there like all the anime ones stuff where you use the mouse and stuff instead of using the mouse use your hand it's honestly not that exciting people it is not it's it's pretty much exactly what we said you rub this magical floaty hand over boobs and the chick goes you know boobs anyway you might be wondering when this is coming out for the Xbox 360 really you're really wondering that here's the thing Microsoft is pretty much said hell no in an interview with IGN they said quote Xbox is a family-friendly games and entertainment console and does not allow adults only content to be certified for use on its platform and would not condone this type of game for Kinect hold on hold on stop right there really IGN really you went and asked them like it was a completely obvious to begin with that this was a first off never going to come out on a console be it was just a PC game anyways and see it wasn't that interesting of an idea but no you have the spare time to go ask them this so you can get a comment so that you can get some more pages good job I agree but at the same time maybe you should dedicate a podcast to that too because they have like 80,000 podcast it's kind of bullshit because you know and I'm probably preaching to the choir here but if somebody really wants to waste $60 on this then you know what let them you know how is this any worse than some of the bang-bang shoot-em-up games that are out there like I don't know mafia 2 that was brought up earlier in the show all right I'm so double standard of sex versus there is a double standard and I bet you anything this will come out in Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 3 where they will have it where you can tickle them with yes it's just tickling and it's just a giant feather that's in your hand it's not actually your hand but it's a giant feather and you can go tickle tickle tickle tickle and they'll go hee hee hee and their boobs will move yeah but that'll be okay that'll be all right DarkSakura would you play Dead or Alive if it had a booby tickling connect mode yes you should be able to unlock them I think that I think that they should have the dudes in the game ok this is the thing boobs are a lot more fun than junk like for bounciness ok I'll with you on that so why don't they have one with dudes and speedos and everything I'm surprised they don't have like a beach you know beach where mode in like Dead or Alive you know wasn't there the whole volleyball game but I'm talking about like actual fighting you know I don't know how I feel about this chat dot orange laundry dot com longs got I don't know in our chat room says poop should be cool in video games no I don't think that's ever really cool like some things you know again if that's what somebody really wants to pay 60 bucks on his poop the game then you know what I mean you can poop for free like every day just eat more fiber you know but tickling chicks with feathers that one that's not every day unless you're a rockstar PC indie game where you had the poop don't shit your pants anything is possible on the PC and that's what that's why folks PC gaming will never cease to exist in you think that poop is not in games yet or at least not enough in games just wait Duke Nukem forever hasn't come out yet so I'm sure there'll be plenty of poop in that I love this oh my god is the best constant comment ever and I can't pronounce this name kassan khan khan with an s says too long so god about his old poop thing fiber uppercut you win you win chatter of the evening right there sound the bells and whistles be me me dude whose name I can't pronounce kassen kassen congrats fiber uppercut you win alrighty hell only on orange launch radio maybe we could get away from the sex topic for a minute here dark Sakura do you have something maybe a little more legitimate for us shadow the hedgehog barf barf barf barf serious yeah well basically Sega wanted to describe what when it is talk about why we got shadow the hedgehog they thought it would work for US gamers the producer of sonic colors Takashi Iizuka said after Sonic adventure we had two studios when the US one in Japan and to continue the quote Japanese studio was to develop a sonic game in the standard style in the US was to develop something different which could contribute to the sonic franchise so basically he was made to work in the US because first and third person shooters were popular and they wanted someone who could work with it hence we got you know shadow the gangsta hedgehog so but what they'd have to realize is that we like sonic because it's not standard american fair file this under the Americans are so stupid been more like don't try to estimate what a completely different cultures going to like why is it that like every time there's a game is like targeted at America it usually like really stinks I don't know maybe I'm just doing an overall broad it was a cool character really well-designed but other than that the concept was just crap it had potential I mean it was you know signed a hedgehog guns I mean how do you make things better yet guns to it or boobs you know or both but somehow they just said you know what instead of making it run fast and stuff we're just gonna make him have guns colors gonna be so much nicer I'm looking forward already I was there but I can't afford it right now there is a game that was like targeted for the u.s. or whatever that wasn't that bad secret of evermore was horribly underrated like it actually was a good game yeah I had that I had the super news I probably still have the Super Nintendo Kart in a bin somewhere but yeah that was not as terrible as people made it out to me I mean it was no second to set so three but it was good in its own way and wasn't that the first game that what's his name the guy who does all the music for like Guild Wars and oblivion Jeremy's soul so they he did that was like his first soundtrack I think was secret evermore so I guess it's rare but it does happen occasionally let's move on yes now I'm gonna try to report this without sounding hateful try not very hard great use a low-key rants and I'm just saying graders both eyes creator wants to add monthly updates that that's fine that that's cool plans premium car upgrades later on stuff like that so basically they're saying that they don't consider their work complete yet really you think that game wasn't rushed to market because it's been you know in development for years now and they really need to get it out this year because the lane again people just kind of roll their eyes at them but you know there's only about fifth of the vehicles that represent in the game right now with premium models which feature higher resolution textures yes that's right some of the good models in the game are quite as finished as others but don't worry they're going to be adding patches later on to add some new items including new premium cars available for download and they haven't said yet whether those updates will be free great so you could pay or possibly pay more for more of your game that you purchase that isn't quite done yet but don't worry they'll finish it someday and they'll call it Gran Turismo 6 when do you think do you think Gran Turismo 6 is going to come out for the ps3 or do you think we're gonna wait for the next system next console yeah what about that whole 10-year life cycle thing we're only what four years old don't worry Gran Turismo 6 prologue will be coming out you know and it'll be totally like the game was I mean man that's guys well I don't know if it's got a suck for the people that bought prologue I mean I think that's a dumb idea to buy the game anyways the prologue cuz what's the point nearly paying for a demo basically oh no no it's a full-featured game with like new very few cars but all right well oh sorry and no it's on demo all right coming also to the PlayStation 3 very soon and a lot of people are excited about this even though this game was already out some time ago Mass Effect 2 is coming out to the PlayStation 3 but there's some you know some tweaks and some upgrades and some new things Mass Effect 3 of course is coming out in 2011 but you of course have this whole weird thing going on where Mass Effect 2 is coming out on the PlayStation 3 but Mass Effect 1 never came out so if I don't own an Xbox how do I get that experience of Mass Effect 1 well they've figured it out there's an interactive comic that's gonna come with Mass Effect 2 called Mass Effect Genesis and what it does is it kind of is a really quick like play I don't say it's a playthrough because it's a comic but it's a real quick summary I guess of the 360 and the PC game Mass Effect 1 but you also get to actually do some things in this comic that you did in the original game you get to make they're saying six decisions that you made in Mass Effect 1 that will now impact your Mass Effect 2 game I hope one of those decisions is making sweet sweet love to the alien chick yes it wasn't the whole lesbian thing in Mass Effect 1 that that hopefully that is one decision but I'm not gonna hold my breath but yeah apparently you will get to make some of the decisions and have your game impacted just like you could play Mass Effect 1 and have your game get impacted in Mass Effect 2 so that's kind of neat so a PlayStation 3 gamer will get to start the game do the opening sequence and then they're gonna go into this comic that I guess will then impact the game later on so that's kind of cool I like that so that again that is coming out in January Mass Effect 1 they are saying is not gonna come out for the PlayStation 3 because they're gonna move on to Mass Effect 3 so this is as close as you're ever gonna get unless you happen to own a PC which you probably do if you're listening to show and you can go play Mass Effect 1 I don't know if Mac has Mass Effect 1 if it is if it does it's probably on Steam there you go we're gonna go now to the mailbag where folks can send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and every week we read your emails live here on air and respond to them mailbag at orange lounge radio.com two emails first one hi everyone I have a question that can possibly that can possibly answered I mean that should be be answered by the OLR gang and chat room I'm an avid knitter and I'm looking for a video game character garments that look like they were knitted the only two examples I can think of are Riku's scarf from Final Fantasy 10 2 and Nora S. Theum sweater slash vest in Final Fantasy 13 pictures attached I've got no problems no projects going on and I'm waiting to start Nora's sweater slash vest as soon as I get patterns from someone to make them up for me because I don't know anything about sewing and patterns thanks so much Stan PS last time I wrote in I was telling you about how a friend said I wasn't a gamer because I didn't like certain games well I confronted him and we're cool now in fact the other friend was with us when I brought it up and made them both listen to that episode of your show and now he's a fan did I already share this I didn't know oh well I don't think so that's kind of cool that's really awesome that we can like make fun of your friend and he's still a fan of the show awesome I'm checking out this oh yeah yeah you're into the whole knitting thing wouldn't I crochet Rob oh I always get the two confused yeah knitting I think you can do more with knitting but I I don't have the coordination for it now when it when I tried to learn again it really made my hand hurt I mean crochet will do it to me after a while because I finished a hat for Becky that was really yeah but you got that whole trigger finger thing still don't you like you know residual stuff from when that was really bothering you well I'm sure there's also characters that wear hats um yeah I would think like a lot of like I don't know I for some reason I think of the Zelda world I also think of a game you should look up as eternal Sonata like I don't know if there was a lot but I don't know why I just think of that game but something that could be like a creative idea like if you're really looking for projects that you know I kind of see these things online once in a while and I always thought they were kind of cool like look up 8-bit sprites and there's a lot of websites around that have like 8-bit 8-bit right repositories needle craft really cuz I was gonna say you could do I mean but still it kind of gives you an idea like how to knit like if you want to make like a blanket or some other type of throw or something I can't believe I'm actually talking about knitting you can get some ideas for patterns from like old-school 8-bit sprites I would think I mean not gonna get clothes patterns but I have to sit and draw it but I did have a plan for a much later project of crocheting a Tetris blanket oh that's fun I'd crochet it actually in the blocks and then attach the box with yarn but I right now I don't have the time or patience for it what about like a pillow front thing or is that more of a needle point you could crochet a sham hmm but but as far as like actual clothing gosh nothing really comes to mind for me I think the best place to go would be RPGs and I don't know why but I'm thinking of the characters from eternal sonata like I've seen one that had a lot of knitting type stuff I don't know I don't know does Dan know the Dan do you know video game characters that wear knitted outfits did he give you the face what he just gave me this face of shit no no Rob I don't earthbound that's that's Ness's sweat oh my gosh knitting advice from Dan Ness's sweater could very well be knitted what a wonderful idea who would have thought this Freddy Krueger hey dude I'm on the street that was a game all right dad goes that Dan goes a really bad game now did he send pictures of his projects cuz I'm seeing pictures of the characters okay well we need to see pictures of your work so we'll be awaiting those pictures that's a really see I think in a lot of games don't have that level of detail in the character design like you know that picture from Final Fantasy 3 of one of the characters is so high-def and so detailed I think you kind of have to go to old-school video games that quote use your imagination a little more because you can't ever see the detail of clothes in a lot of games to know if they were knitted or not you know well last email hey guys hey for festivals slash December wien one of my friends gifted me with her PlayStation 2 which she no longer uses nice gift this extremely this is extremely awesome considering that one of my evil exes took my old ps2 the downside is that the only ps2 game I still own his Final Fantasy 10 how about helping me to rebuild my ps2 library by suggesting a few good games for me to buy thanks tiara ps I'm gonna rob I want to be on

roleplay game type fan so definitely 10 to 12 was horrifically underrated because it came out right with the news yeah that's a good one I think the dot hack games were always really underrated it's that whole simulated MMO thing but they're a little more action II I think those are really good to look into I can't remember the name of the first one it's dot hack volume one infection thank you Dan Daniels magic pen gel was an underlooked RPG game that's where you could draw wieners and then they could go into battle and stuff we had a lot of fun on that with that game in the early days of the show and graffiti Kingdom of course there are tons and tons of DDR games if you want to get your music game thing on amplitude and frequency are both very good games even though you can't play amplitude online anymore I get the space channel 5 package their space channel 5 part 1 & 2 were released together combined I'm unwinding my thing and I'm going into the vault I'm trying to think of

part of the show where we get angsty um I really don't have an FU to be honest I'm actually having a great week I passed algebra so I'm gonna say F you to the Photoshop selection tool that's it Loki do you have an FU of the week I yeah F you the Comcast surprise yeah no big surprise yeah fuck them for not being able to hook up my cable correctly it apparently takes them numerous crews to do something very simple like running a drop to the street apparently they have a crew that specializes in underground installations oh but that crew doesn't know how to actually hook up anything they have to send out another crew to hook it up to the street oh but that guy doesn't know actually how to hook it up to the house and send another guy to the house to hook it up at the house oh but that guy needs to have you know a person assess what needs to be hooked up first so they have to send somebody else out why don't you just I don't know train everybody for everything because I'm sure it's not going to be that difficult to teach somebody how to crimp on a new connector for a goddamn coax cable hell I did it myself I was about to install my own damn cable when I was like hey you know what why the hell am I doing this so yes they really need to I don't know get their shit straight um gosh I don't really have a strong F you and to follow up to that but I will say F you to traffic I had to drive to the Bay Area on Friday night and it took me like three and a half hours to get there thanks to a traffic jam on 880 so F you 880 you suck Dan the Manson house you want to give an F you it should be on hello hello hey there I'd like to throw a nephew to God or at least the weather for really sucking ass right before I have to drive for like 15 hours thanks that's real cute it's all real nice real real good the week that I have to drive someplace snow and rain and crap from the sky and who else can I blame god suck it in mother nature and he was also really pissed at me because I saw Tron on Tuesday yeah but Dan got over it because he saw it I'm gonna say this for the record I don't know what my wife's problem is but I'm a fair man I got to go to the Tron sneak preview and I'm Max and I didn't tell her a lot about it cuz you don't want to hear about it she's a little better so she got was too so she got me so she got to go to the Tron sneak preview and I was a little bitter but I wasn't gonna be like no and it all worked out fine for me because thanks to the unstoppable pimp Matt I got to go see it for free and it was awesome it was awesome so I'm throwing F you to Jamie for going to see Connor fucker fucker right in the air what put your fucking hand down I got your mic now this is my show I'm taking over it's Dan lounge radio oh no it's a Dan coo not fucking I'm

Tran Jessica's in chat saying I deserve that if you sorry Dan no just don't know no Dan Dan's yelling for the other room it ain't her fault it ain't her fault he's he's clear from that's right you got it you got to act on those opportunities you got to all right anyhow let's move on to where we at the Skype line no we got a couple more stories and then the Skype like Dan get a mic or GTFO all right 1877 game olr just a little bit right after two more stories for you guys Loki when I first saw this headline I was like sweet Xbox is finally getting all risque cuz they said goodbye gal gun panties I was like ooh I didn't think they would go there but no it's not unfortunately what I thought it was they're actually censoring the game and removing the panty shots so now you know the chick has a different angle in her here per ponytail houses me covering her panty line and that kind of stuff apparently I guess 79 days before the game's released in Japan Microsoft call the meeting with the gal gun developer alchemist and they just basically said you know what we're gonna have to censor the game and not put all these panty shots in there but that's the point how are you gonna sell the game now they're saying now I don't know that they're just basically because I guess the game I don't know if the game uses the connector whatever maybe that you know they're trying to gear more towards like a family gamer now I don't I think they really game is fun for the whole family hot chicks bending over XNA game come on XNA here's something you use the connect for spanking when those when those naughty girls bend over you can spank them with the connect come on you know you want it what spanking game yesterday the Loki not my forte but you know the way for that who am I to judge other people you are here's here's a great story you're in love this and this is totally a time with what we're talking about and stuff there is a comic that was on Kotaku the ran a thing it was a visual guide to in fact I gotta find it real quick so I can show you in studio here is a visual guide to the ESRB and it showed a chick so and she was segmented as it went down so the E was her head T was you know her cleavage M was you know her naked naked vagina I guess censored obviously because it's you know it's classy and AO was tentacles sneaking up and now he's like what is that like it's it's tentacle rape and well it's something that's popular in Japan what she was unaware of the whole tentacle rape scene I guess you know Tiger Claw in our chat room says maybe it's the game parents will use when kids ask them where do babies come from they go solar flare in our chair in the chat dot orange on twitter.com says Rob spanking teaches kids to hit one more story for you guys and has to do with indie games and the Humble Bundle Humble Bundle 2 was released this past week and in less than 24 hours after its release it got over $500,000 in revenue this is notable because this is one of those pay what you want type of games and five games for whatever you want to pay for it DRM free the biggest pair was Marcus person who spent $2,000 you might know him a little better as the guy who made Minecraft pay $2,000 for the set which you know he's sitting pretty right now with the whole Minecraft stuff Infinity Ward's Robert bowling spent $500 on the pack so there you go the average price that people are paying for this seven dollars and change the pack comes with braid cortex command machinarium osmose and revenge of the Titans you can divide your payments between the developers the electronic frontier front foundation and child's play charity so in other words if you don't want to pay the developers you want a hundred percent of your donation go to child's play go for it that indeed is some developers being very humble in allowing that to be sold very cool twitter.com slash humble for more information on that all right very cool we're gonna go to the skype line now let me open it up I don't have it open right now now it's open 1 8 7 7 game olr if you want to give us a call or our username on skype orange lounge radio remember if you are gonna give us a call on skype you do want to give echo 1 2 3 a call first to make sure your connection works please please do us all a favor if you're on skype itself echo 1 2 3 the 800 numbers a lot easier because all you need for that's a phone that's 8 7 7 game olr while we wait for some calls because there's a little bit of a delay between when I ask for calls when they start coming in Loki do you have any last-minute stories for us no I don't I'm starting a new trend by trying icing a picture of myself and like people were doing with avatar oh really oh that's kind of cute what you're doing yeah I'm surprised there's no like filter thingy on Photoshop or one of those programs that will kind of automatically do something ish so all right well let's go to the phone we get a call coming in hi you are you look hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is excellent hi excellent what's on your mind buddy you forgot about one game series in particular for the ps2 and I'm quite upset at you for doing this Rob all right persona series ah I thought somebody in chat said persona and I said it my bad no anything actually any title with Atlas is pretty much gold I haven't come across really one game from Alice is really so terrible that would not talk about it actually they have a really good game on ps3 a demon sword or no what am I thinking nope nope scratch that demon souls is the game that's out on ps3 that's that's a great ps3 exclusive game in fact I believe it was just given a price reduction because in the greatest hit series and servers think one of the stories that missed our show all this week but I remember reading the servers are gonna be open through at least March 2011 if not beyond I think definitely if you're looking for a long series of playtime with a role-playing game dot hack series is really really good there was the four games and then there was three for the G the GU which was happening right after so they keep the storyline pretty much intact throughout the whole thing but it's really cool how you can take your safe game from the first up from the first game but in the second take their stages the second game into the third the third game into the fourth so you can carry it on and then if you take it and put into the new series which happened few years after that they'll give you cool bonuses for doing so so I it pays to play it's really good ray craft in our Chatham is correcting me saying demon souls isn't an atlas game they just published it well still still is a great game but it has their name by it so SSJ 100 they don't put their name behind sucky game so right as we don't get president cat and everything will be well exactly they need yet at president cat SSJ 100 Matt is also saying Disgaea now there's there's a good good suggestion and also also if you happen to be in a Japanese region earth defense force 2 ooh good thought very good thought so what else is on your mind excellent what anything else fun and exciting going on in your gaming world well I don't know well I'm kind of disappointed you have invited me onto your show yet either considering that was the number one achieving core and your guilt for quite a while if I remember correctly before it's there someone took my spot but that's quite okay because you know I'm not gonna be better anything about that and you shouldn't be there's been thankfully there's been a lot of people that have wanted to be on so we're trying to give everybody a shot I know I'm playing rice princess was only on because we kind of needed someone in someone quickly so she came back on twice but we're gonna get we're gonna get lots of people on so that's cool but yeah I'm very much enjoying cataclysm keeping up to the wee hours in the morning playing all the different stuff for how many hours have you spent on your archaeology only you know what it hasn't been that long believe it or not I spend almost probably in my two days probably give or take wow that's still a long time you're probably only up to level like 200 or I'm 420 I'm almost 425 20 or 25 nice I got excited because today I'm doing fossils or whatever and my next dig is going to be a pet oh there you go some pet the Raptor right yeah the little Raptor fossil raptor so that's that and actually makes me jealous because some of the battlegrounds now for like the mountain people met up there you think version of it and actually this will make you really jealous because you're an achievement whore and I'll leave you on this do you know what achievement I got today hmm stood in the fire oh really you're death wing showed up while I was doing archaeology alright did you survive or did you actually I actually survived not to turn this into the Wow show but I actually survived because what I did I flew through the fire instead of getting on the ground and like I don't the timing or something worked out I got the achievement and didn't die my friend she was in ratchet and she actually lived with like one hit point or something was weird but nice you couldn't believe it she's like yeah I actually got an achievement but yet I live and she took an awesome screenshot of the town I mean just totally engulfed in flames everywhere I mean you couldn't even really tell it was bad for a bit because of the flames in the background but it was a really cool screenshot good times all right well I should let you go before the Wow haters come out and start whatever what I'm paying too much wow and welcome to the gale Jamie okay take care excellent she's busy on her Tron pick later all right bye all right one eight seven seven game olr do you hear that dr. Sarkar he said welcome to the guild she has a pen in her mouth right now no I heard thank you see Rob season four you have your little tronny looking headband working lies okay that was like fun eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call but we got a call coming in right now hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this would be miss Jessica Harper hi Jessica Harper how are you I am doing just fine how are you guys doing great so glad to have you back on the show what's new I actually came with an agenda tonight Oh something that I believe you guys spoke about before as per my conversation with Jamie but we have us olr madness we are currently taking your top 25 lists and unfortunately we haven't received as many as we would like so you know what it is they're a bunch of procrastinators yeah I know but the deadline is coming up and and since us all will be on hiatus just based on how the holidays fall Oh since we have you know Christmas on a Saturday and then New Year's Eve on a Saturday yikes yeah yeah kind of puts us in a little bit of a hiatus so I thought I'd come and you know be a pain and you got in your ass and you know no worries on your show we did we think it's great what you guys do over there why why why us l olr madness because it is the way that you the gaming audience can actually get your voice out there and be heard and you know show what the real games that people love are rather than those that are just being you know highly profitable because people are spending way too much money on stupid shit and it won't be rigged for Final Fantasy 7 like the game facts contests are every year every year it's Final Fantasy 7 something yeah exactly now father seven could we could win it has been in the top like 16 but I don't believe it's won a madness title yet I don't believe so I don't say for certain but I don't believe so I don't think any Final Fantasy game has come to think of it I know Super Metroid's one chrono triggers one and I think Mario Brothers 3 has won a couple times and chrono trigger is up there very very very far it's all the listeners wanting to spite me for saying it's overrated if anybody wants to get their top 25 listed and has not yet just go ahead and formulate your top 25 list send it to usl madness at gmail.com we will tack it on in with the rest of the votes and deadline is January 3rd so get your votes in and we will be starting right after the holidays excited to see it I'm trying to pull up my list that I had actually sent to Bresl so I can give you a little taste taste of what I'm rooting for here hold on I'm trying to pull it up my email archive here I said I set my list on November 30th because I'm a very good boy you're a good boy um here I'll give you just a little taste my number one game of course was Super Metroid I mean it is the best game ever my number two game this year was the civilization series I think between five out this year and four being so epic and the original being so awesome I think Civ is deserving of a spot that high up and just you know with five this year I was just like oh this is all amazeballs my number three game was Castlevania Symphony of the night Metroidvania of course you've got to put it up high up there and my four number four game this year Final Fantasy six so I did put a file has a game in my top five um my number 25 game I'm not gonna read the whole list for you guys my number 25 game this year cuz I always like to be controversial and put something kind of like really random in there plants versus zombies you know I put plants versus zombies on my list too oh maybe it'll make the top 64 then but that's the weird thing is that John has been keeping good track of things and it has not breached the top 25 recently hmm during the initial voting it was one of the top 25 and it did get pushed out it's not even in the bubble zone right now so well if you love plants versus zombies you better put it on your list if you think plants and zombies is the greatest game ever made you better hurry the hell up and get in there yes awesome well what else anything else going on in your world Jessica sure well I got a new computer and I have a brand new video card that I'm ready to put into it but it is a slim computer and while I did get a low-profile card I do not have the proper brackets for it so I'm in a holding pattern once again and just waiting for my brackets so I can put my new video card in actually start doing some decent PC gaming so I I actually had something similar happen when I bought a new video card it was so uber it wouldn't fit in there with the power supply so we had to get a new power supply as well to make it all work yeah yeah no it's it's gonna be a very tight squeeze and I'm not quite sure exactly how it's gonna work but I'll make it work dammit there you go so when he's signing up for Wow no I'm kidding no I have a feeling that I might end up with Star Trek online somewhere in my mailbox at some point I'm not sure so if you want a 10-day trial let me know I may still have another card dark soccer's recruiting we shall see we shall see all right oh yeah and of course that of course Travis is a big fan of that too is Disney so yes I wouldn't be surprised at all all right well Jessica good luck with the new PC I hope it brings you lots of gaming joy this holiday season and I think so already bought brought me Plants vs. Zombies so there we go best of luck with everything going on at under station live sorry to hear about the bad timing of the holidays this year but hey enjoy the break oh thank you very much all right take care have a good night guys too well hey Rob I also need to say speaking of plugs as everyone go to geek-life.com we've got a year-end thing going on there as well it's a it's not you know necessarily like a usl madness we have actually the geek life Awards good check there all right orange lounge radio on skype or 1-877 game olr is the number to call we are taking some calls hi you are on orange lounge radio hey hey it's Ron how's everyone doing tonight hey hey Rama we're okay it's the end of the year shows shows running a little short tonight surprisingly but you know I know this I was like wait they're already at and the party already where the time go there's just it's it even though we try to fill the show with lots of news sometimes the news doesn't have a lot of discussion to go with it I mean there's not a lot to say to you know Shadow the Hedgehog was made for Americans or whatever or yeah you know Sony PlayStation shadow my two cents about the in the chat room yeah all right well what's on your mind buddy why'd you call well to satisfy Brussels I finally sent up my 25 cuz I realized I didn't play enough games this year to qualify so I'm sitting there for about an hour putting my list together and picking the brains of my roommates for what games did you like and I was like keep in mind it's not the top 25 of this year it's the top 25 of all time I know but still I just feel I don't really game enough for it but I got my list together and I sent it out all right good boy and I did put on their Final Fantasy 6 good good man that's a great Final Fantasy game although um Final Fantasy 4 I sometimes call my favorite I gave it a little bit of a backseat which is funny because I sent that list in before the news about the PSP version it will probably be back near the top of my list next year after I play the PSP version so we'll see so all right well what was at the top of your list can I be nosy what was your number one game ever Scott Pilgrim versus the world the game what was your number one game of all time I loved that game this is one the few games where I sat there and played it over and over and over and this is one of those games where yeah tap the bank for the crack that's that's what that game fell under for me all right where every gamer has a voice even when those voices are insane um just kidding I'm kidding if you like I never see ransom I mean really I'm giving you shit actually I'm watching Loki in studios playing I think the new version of Super Mario crossover like there was a brand new version that came out but he is driving the blaster master car and that made me think oh man blaster master should have been on my list blaster masters in Mario crossover yes they just added Sofia the car from a blaster master is now in Mario crossover version and it's awesome I now have my reason to play the game I'm going to tell my roommate and he is going to he's gonna fangasm yeah I need somebody to send in the top 25 list that has blaster master near the top to me to make up for the fact that I left it off my list all right dark soccer says she will I still haven't sent my listen oh good good I need some blaster master love because I forgot so I'm an idiot we have to send this listen I believe the third was the deadline but you're procrastinating but should do it right now all right anything else in your mind tonight Rama yeah do you think programmers purposely put code into games where you swear it cheats um it depends on the type of game but like when you say games that cheat my mind automatically goes immediately goes to Super Mario Kart and the whole rubber banding and this is a very common thing you hear in racing games it's not Mario Kart is not the only racing game that does it a lot of them do but I yes that's that's basically program cheating is that if you are too far ahead of the other contestants they get to speed boost or whatever to catch up to you that's programmed to cheat to make it more exciting so heck yeah I think they program cheating but that's just the difficulty or whatever you want to call it I never had a problem Mario Kart but I can understand how you code a game so there's some glitches here and there that may cause cheating but I'm talking purpose gene for example my roommates playing Dragon Age he is in an area where he has to go in and like take everybody out it's like his team of four grown up of a team of eight says he walks into the area that whole team just slaughters him under 15 minutes think screaming repulsive repeatedly at the game is cheating with me personally I don't think the game cheat you just suck but that that dates all the way back to the NES days when like you would be playing a sports game or any time you gave RC Pro-Am was another racer that would just infuriate people the game's fucking cheating man this game fucking cheats actually put in purpose code for cheating compared to where your skills aren't good enough padawan or it's just ramping up the difficulty keep in mind a lot of those you know NES and if you want to go way back Atari 2600 games we're set to loop over and over and over again so of course the difficulty gets insane and harder than you know you're able to do at some point because that's just you know what it is of course so like or take a game like civilization and its highest difficulty level I believe the computer opponents can build resources like 1.4 times as fast as you can so you have to really think about how to you know use your resources well I don't think that's really cheating the game is cheaper say that's just like advanced skill God mode it's like you know what you're getting yourself into when you walk into it yeah and if you can beat that then you're a fucking stud like you are like you but you know going into it okay I am playing an uphill battle here and if I beat this I'm awesome mm-hmm so yeah all right well Rama we're gonna let you go to try and get some more calls tonight but thank you so much for your call have a going buddy you too stay fabulous now I will I will go I will all right 1877 game olr or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio why not we got time for one more call if you want to give us a call tonight's running a little bit more
