00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:23,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight, December 12, 2010, a high-profile PlayStation 3 game gets a big delay, Australia debates a new video game rating, and more rumors leak about the PSP2.

2
00:00:31,482 --> 00:00:38,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:48,895
[SPEAKER_02]: For about three hours, give or take, every Sunday night we meet to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that stuff with you guys in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

4
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:50,196
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:53,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be joining you with my co-host Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:54,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

7
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:55,119
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Productive.

9
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:57,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Productive.

10
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:58,122
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

11
00:00:58,222 --> 00:00:59,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Productive Jamie is happy Jamie, right?

12
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Sort of.

13
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:04,352
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm being paid for it, so.

14
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:05,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, money!

15
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:06,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, money!

16
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I'm going into finals week, so.

17
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:10,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

18
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:11,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

19
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:11,935
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

20
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:13,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good luck with all that crap.

21
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:14,477
[SPEAKER_13]: It's algebra.

22
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:15,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello.

23
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:16,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

24
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:21,561
[SPEAKER_02]: If 2X plus 9 equals Y, and forget it.

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,181
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

26
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:24,543
[SPEAKER_13]: I could actually rewrite that 5 million different ways now.

27
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:25,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Solve for kitten.

28
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:28,565
[SPEAKER_13]: The answer is Shermie.

29
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Can't divide by kitten, unfortunately.

30
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:32,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Loki.

31
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:32,628
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

32
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:35,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Tech Master Loki joins us here every week with his witty insight.

33
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,490
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Loki?

34
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:38,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Good, and you can't divide by kitten.

35
00:01:39,907 --> 00:01:40,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like zero.

36
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:43,109
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't mix the kitten with anti-kitten!

37
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Not unless kitten is radical.

38
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:48,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's going to be one of those shows tonight.

39
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:50,413
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not going to make any sense at all.

40
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:51,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, say hello.

41
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:52,294
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some guests.

42
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:55,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pluralists in studio tonight.

43
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:57,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to introduce them here.

44
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:00,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Since he has the mic, I will say hello to Salacious Pop.

45
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

46
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, how are you?

47
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:02,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm great, how are you?

48
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:05,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I am well, thanks for asking.

49
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:12,068
[SPEAKER_02]: except for the fact that, you know, it's Sunday night and then once this whole schtick is over, it's back to the work week, you know.

50
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:16,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you have to be at work at like 7, 7.30 for a while now up until the holidays.

51
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:18,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I'm just not a morning person.

52
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:24,477
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really like my job, don't get me wrong, but it's just one of those like, you know, oh, getting used to the new schedules is really messing with me.

53
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:26,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it is what it is, so.

54
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:34,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma says if you divide by cat, you get kitten, but technically if you multiply two cat equals kitten, six kitten.

55
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:39,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even understand any of this.

56
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,139
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

57
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So also say hello in studio.

58
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,240
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another guest joining us tonight.

59
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,540
[SPEAKER_02]: RKDN42.

60
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my friend.

61
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,541
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

62
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:49,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Long time no see.

63
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:51,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen you since, I don't think you've been here since the marathon episode.

64
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:53,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, that's the last time I was in.

65
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:56,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Which funny enough, Salacious Pop was here for too.

66
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:58,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like a marathon show reunion.

67
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:01,044
[SPEAKER_13]: No marathons, please.

68
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:01,764
[SPEAKER_02]: No marathons.

69
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:03,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to stay up until 4 a.m.

70
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:03,505
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight?

71
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:04,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Woo!

72
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:05,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

73
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:09,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a podcast to edit after the show, so I can do it.

74
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:10,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.

75
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:11,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.

76
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:13,227
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like New Year's Rockin' Eve.

77
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:14,308
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow.

78
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:16,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

79
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:20,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

80
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:23,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft in our chat room starts us off with this classy comment.

81
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop, the occasional fourth host of the show.

82
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if he sleeps with one of the hosts.

83
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:33,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I always refer to the chat room as the ever-present fourth guest on the show.

84
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:38,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, Actdeft, you're implying that the entire chat room is, in fact, sleeping with one of the hosts.

85
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is what he's really trying to say.

86
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Slumber party!

87
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoever falls asleep first gets their underwear thrown in the freezer.

88
00:03:45,754 --> 00:03:51,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow your dreams and never let anyone tell you that you cannot sleep your way to the paragon of independent video game journalism.

89
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,224
[SPEAKER_06]: You put on your little black dress and you work it and you will be where I am now.

90
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe in your dreams.

91
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:00,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

92
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:05,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to share something right now before I forget about it and before we get to our gaming weeks.

93
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something I need antibiotics for, is it?

94
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:15,574
[SPEAKER_13]: This gorgeous piece of journalism, which I will take a picture of and show the chat room in a moment, is the American River Review 2011 edition.

95
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,534
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done design in this.

96
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,074
[SPEAKER_13]: It's $25.

97
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:20,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Go buy one!

98
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:22,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would anyone not in this area want one?

99
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:25,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this thing wins like Uber awards.

100
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:27,536
[SPEAKER_02]: We have people in Sweden that listen to this show.

101
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:31,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should a Swedish person buy some community college?

102
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:32,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, recipes!

103
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:33,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic literature.

104
00:04:33,757 --> 00:04:34,737
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a best of edition.

105
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:36,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic art.

106
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Fashion.

107
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:39,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, fashion?

108
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:49,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet all of our gaming guys that listen to this show and they're teens that are between games of Call of Duty and Halo Reach are like, oh my god, fashion?

109
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:52,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do I buy?

110
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:55,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the art in here is definitely nerd influenced.

111
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any video game reviews in there?

112
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:01,283
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but there's lots of talk of video games in some of the stories.

113
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:01,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

114
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:08,006
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously people, some of the writers are definite geeks, but it is a worthy purchase.

115
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:12,428
[SPEAKER_13]: I will find the ordering information and post it somewhere so everyone can see.

116
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,329
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've worked on this one.

117
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:22,192
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, if you send me the money to get it for you, I will autograph it and get other people to autograph it and send it back to you so you can have an autographed copy.

118
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:25,149
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

119
00:05:55,185 --> 00:06:15,479
[SPEAKER_13]: by awesome I mean amazing and it's really hard to take a picture of something black um I uh what nevermind what no that's inappropriate just don't take a picture of my penis then okay I went there I went there that was rumored to be a problem with the Kinect at one time

120
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,373
[SPEAKER_13]: At any rate, I played a lot of Final Fantasy.

121
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,514
[SPEAKER_13]: I played a lot of Star Trek Online.

122
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:27,075
[SPEAKER_13]: They have completely redone Sector Space.

123
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,396
[SPEAKER_13]: I was showing you guys the pictures.

124
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you can actually turn off that little grid thing.

125
00:06:32,318 --> 00:06:34,539
[SPEAKER_13]: And when the grid is on, it's actually a lot less pronounced.

126
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,140
[SPEAKER_13]: But then you can just fly around like you're in space.

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,462
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have the little light trails as your ship moves, which people were complaining about.

128
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:42,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, light trails and grid?

129
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:45,796
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

130
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:06,622
[SPEAKER_13]: When you approach systems, it used to be that it would look like a little glowing model of a system, like you had in science class.

131
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, it's you approach stars.

132
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:13,187
[SPEAKER_13]: And as you get closer, it actually looks like a sun.

133
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:16,530
[SPEAKER_13]: And the planets pop up around it.

134
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,252
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like you're actually approaching the system.

135
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:21,934
[SPEAKER_13]: And only other turkeys will get this.

136
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:26,238
[SPEAKER_13]: When you go to the Badlands, or to Little Nebula, or something...

137
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:31,759
[SPEAKER_13]: When you approach it, it actually looks like a haze off in the distance and then you're in there.

138
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:41,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Then when you actually enter the system or the area, then you're fully... Rob's pulling up the freaking... Well, Aisha, I was going to say that we have a clip of the soundtrack for the new Star Trek expansion.

139
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:45,862
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

140
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:47,763
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're flying through space?

141
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:48,423
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

142
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:48,963
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

143
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:53,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave... You can't touch a rainbow or...

144
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:57,715
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like they've retextured some of the planets.

145
00:07:57,755 --> 00:07:59,376
[SPEAKER_13]: They've retextured the characters.

146
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,698
[SPEAKER_13]: They've updated some stuff.

147
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Earth Starbase has a basement now.

148
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, fucking basement.

149
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,464
[SPEAKER_13]: I also finally decided to make an Orion Slave Girl.

150
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:13,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Running around in a bikini.

151
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,047
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fantastic.

152
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:20,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently you can modify the Gorn now like anyone wants to play a giant freaking lizard.

153
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:21,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I have to share this.

154
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:23,231
[SPEAKER_13]: It has something to do with it.

155
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:28,139
[SPEAKER_13]: There's my favorite Star Trek episode reviewer on YouTube.

156
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:29,241
[SPEAKER_13]: It's SFDebris.

157
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:30,483
[SPEAKER_13]: He's funny.

158
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:32,867
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the highly opinionated Star Trek reviews.

159
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,029
[SPEAKER_13]: And...

160
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,902
[SPEAKER_13]: He was talking about Cisco winning.

161
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:42,004
[SPEAKER_13]: They did one for Trials and Tribulations for DS9.

162
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,885
[SPEAKER_13]: And talking about Cisco winning.

163
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:46,467
[SPEAKER_13]: He could have talked to Kirk about all this other stuff.

164
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:50,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead, he wanted to hear about the one time he porched a giant lizard in the nose.

165
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Punched, I should say, not porched.

166
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,392
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder what a porch punch is.

167
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,835
[SPEAKER_13]: This guy's reviews are fantastic.

168
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:00,295
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Barry Waddle on purpose.

169
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:03,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe because Dork Von Weenie was already taken.

170
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:07,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Arn Darvin, you see, is actually a Klingon.

171
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:08,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey!

172
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:11,507
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's really funny.

173
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:18,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, he also said that the Defiant should have been named Ben Sisko's motherfucking pimp slap... Pimp hand!

174
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:20,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Pimp slap hand, that was it.

175
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:23,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Ben Sisko's motherfucking left pimp slap hand.

176
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:28,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Star Trek Humor Podcast.

177
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:30,977
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some really funny jokes for you today.

178
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:34,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a really good zinger about Klingons.

179
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:35,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.

180
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:36,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this NPR?

181
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:37,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Where am I?

182
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:37,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

183
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:40,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk of the nation.

184
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

185
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can finish with my story.

186
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,141
[SPEAKER_13]: But at any rate.

187
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:51,026
[SPEAKER_13]: They've made lots of changes for the better.

188
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:52,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Still pissed off at Dabo.

189
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:54,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Hololita's still annoying.

190
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:58,348
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's really about it.

191
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:02,669
[SPEAKER_13]: They've done a bunch of other retexturing, but really they've closed off.

192
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:12,271
[SPEAKER_13]: The one thing I'm looking forward to is trying out the Foundry, which is you can create your own missions and then have other people go and play them.

193
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,472
[SPEAKER_13]: You can put them up for other people to download and play.

194
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:39,854
[SPEAKER_13]: so the good thing about that is that while maybe you've gone through all the major missions and everything is oh yay but you can actually go through and play new content that other people have created and that's really neat on the Tribble server they've got this thing to create new content which I haven't gotten to work yet but I'm going to look into that too the Tribble server is the playtest server

195
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:40,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

196
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:41,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

197
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:23,404
[SPEAKER_06]: the last issue that the free expansion that City of Heroes put out was issue 14 the mission architect creator where you could create your own campaigns and that was the last expansion that Cryptic worked on so it sounds like they're doing something similar for Star Trek

198
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:24,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

199
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:49,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at my boobs.

200
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:50,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

201
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:56,204
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a succubus with a warlock character and she'll show people her boobs and use a move called seduce.

202
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:56,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

203
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:58,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, my offer still stands.

204
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:00,330
[SPEAKER_13]: If people want to pay for me to play World of Warcraft, I will.

205
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:01,852
Well,

206
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:04,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was going to go in a different direction there.

207
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the chat room likes my NPR voice.

208
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:13,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of these days I'm going to have to just do an Orange Lounge Radio in all NPR voice.

209
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:17,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could just go listen to that Techno Kitten Adventure interview.

210
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, this is Terry Gross.

211
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:19,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Today we're going to talk about...

212
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:22,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

213
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:27,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a hilarious interview coming up with Nick, the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure.

214
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,179
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be joining us to talk about his game.

215
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, we'll be talking about USL Madness.

216
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,960
[SPEAKER_02]: It's maddening.

217
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,001
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, when Bob uses that voice, it sounds a lot like the Saturday Night Live sketch.

218
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:41,002
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I expect to have Martha Stewart come out and make brownies.

219
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:44,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Loki, how was your gaming week?

220
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:45,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Please help.

221
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:57,032
[SPEAKER_16]: My gaming week consisted of not much because, one, I didn't have internet, which is not really a big factor because I don't play online games at home.

222
00:12:57,813 --> 00:12:58,793
[SPEAKER_16]: At least not anymore.

223
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:00,294
[SPEAKER_16]: And...

224
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:02,886
[SPEAKER_16]: What else?

225
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:05,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, Grand Theft Auto at work.

226
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Swords and Poker 2 on the iPod.

227
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:17,676
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did try out Infinity Blade, which is all sorts of beautiful and actually plays pretty good.

228
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:22,079
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's very neat what they can do on the iPod.

229
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,921
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, that's pretty much it.

230
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:26,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't play a whole lot.

231
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:28,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to our guests.

232
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:30,785
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if our guests have anything exciting to share.

233
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:31,726
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Salacious Pulp?

234
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:35,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Only two games to talk about, really.

235
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:35,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe two and a half.

236
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,913
[SPEAKER_06]: The half is Knights of the Crystals on Facebook.

237
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:39,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Knights of the Clicky.

238
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:42,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Knights of the Clicky, not really a game.

239
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:45,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta use all your action points.

240
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:50,216
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to feed cows in it, so already it's good.

241
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:52,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to spend my action points before coming to this show.

242
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:52,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pissed.

243
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:53,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

244
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:54,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.

245
00:13:55,358 --> 00:14:00,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you buy the $50 worth of Square Enix points, that's the best value.

246
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,403
[SPEAKER_02]: What a waste spending money on that game.

247
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:06,004
[SPEAKER_02]: The items you get... Forget it.

248
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:11,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Then Poker Night at the Inventory on Steam.

249
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:12,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been...

250
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:19,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Slowly unlocking, because I've definitely gotten better at the Texas Hold'em thing as I've been playing.

251
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been unlocking the various tables and deck cards.

252
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,040
[SPEAKER_06]: So it does have unlockables in it.

253
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,924
[SPEAKER_06]: No new characters, but I have the Fruit Fucker card table and the Salmon Max.

254
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:34,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you mean the Fruit Friend?

255
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Fruit Friend.

256
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:38,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Fruit Friend card table and the Salmon Max deck of cards.

257
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:40,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what they're calling it in there?

258
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:41,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Fruit Friend, yeah.

259
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:41,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

260
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Strong Bad Cracks Me Up the Most

261
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to poke a little fun at it, come on.

262
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:15,160
[SPEAKER_02]: For the longest time, we look like we're totally telltale biased, so I have to take an opportunity to poke this one where I can.

263
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:26,267
[SPEAKER_06]: When the seg was on a couple weeks ago on the show, he was like, it's a very basic fan service game, don't expect it to be anything other than trying to take us down a couple notches on the hype.

264
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:27,067
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, that's true.

265
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:27,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

266
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:48,227
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Cataclysm of course came out Monday night so I'm in deep home right now level no I'm about to start Oldham I'm level 83 haven't done any of the new level 1 content yet for any of the races I'm very much working on my main and you have a separate WoW podcast for all of that so that's all I'm going to say but it's out it's there

267
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,394
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, I'm going to talk Cataclysm a little bit here.

268
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's a huge, huge thing.

269
00:15:52,478 --> 00:15:55,484
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to cross over a little bit.

270
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:59,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Overall, I'm very amazed at how seamless the digital...

271
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:00,767
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

272
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:24,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

273
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:25,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, alright.

274
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:25,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

275
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:26,365
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

276
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:26,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ma'am.

277
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,467
[SPEAKER_13]: When I get back from Washington, I'll play for a month.

278
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:30,427
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the spirit!

279
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:36,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, there's actually email coming up about how you can do that for free, so we're gonna get to that later.

280
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:45,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you probably haven't peeked at the mailbag yet, but somebody who listens to the other show also listens to this one and sent a great tip, so we'll talk about that when we get to the mailbag.

281
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:47,356
[SPEAKER_02]: First, though, we gotta finish off Gaming Weeks.

282
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:53,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian42, I know you play a lot of... You have a pretty diverse lineup of games that you play, right?

283
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,143
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

284
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and it's really a thumb killer too.

285
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:20,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one of the new Xbox controllers.

286
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I commented on it briefly that the D-pad's a little bit better.

287
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:27,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's that much improved.

288
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:30,076
[SPEAKER_07]: It might hurt your finger a little bit more than the original.

289
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:31,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

290
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:32,498
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I forgot those had come out.

291
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:33,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they were on there.

292
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot that now's the season.

293
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:35,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

294
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:39,725
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's nice having a better charge pack so that lasts longer than the older one.

295
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:41,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you used that at all for Game Room?

296
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you were big into Game Room for a little while.

297
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I've barely gotten done into Game Room.

298
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:49,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard about what's come out in Game Room?

299
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:54,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this week, I'm not even kidding, Twinbee and Datana Twinbee both hit Game Room this week.

300
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, Puyan.

301
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,045
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Game Pack 12 was like, bam, bam, bam.

302
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,766
[SPEAKER_02]: All these huge titles came out.

303
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:05,968
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all Konami, but it's almost like...

304
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:10,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, why didn't you give us this shit like three months ago?

305
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,650
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have paid more attention.

306
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:17,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I downloaded those packs, but I haven't actually... Because they were taking a long time to download, so I went to some other game.

307
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:26,234
[SPEAKER_07]: And the main game I've been playing this week is Resonance of Fate, which is a Trias game that Sega put out.

308
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:27,274
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually an RPG.

309
00:18:27,354 --> 00:18:28,674
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got an interesting battle system.

310
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:29,815
[SPEAKER_07]: All the characters use guns.

311
00:18:31,395 --> 00:19:00,445
[SPEAKER_07]: and so they have different like they have like a machine gun and the other people have like guns and like thrown weapons like grenades so you level up by your weapon experience and basically you have to think strategically because you have to move around the board because when you move the enemies move and they charge up and everything and you have like the set number of like hero gauge or I can't remember where you can have your character run across the fields like the other side like most of the

312
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:01,205
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

313
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:30,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed this one.

314
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:31,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 360 game?

315
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:32,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

316
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been looking for a new RPG to play on 360.

317
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and there's probably several things you'd like about it.

318
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:37,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

319
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:39,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the characters are interesting.

320
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:48,791
[SPEAKER_07]: They run into a lot of oddball kind of characters that basically are going on different fetch quests and do this for me, go to this area and fetch me something.

321
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:53,333
[SPEAKER_07]: And some are a bit crazy.

322
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:54,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

323
00:19:56,233 --> 00:20:24,021
[SPEAKER_07]: but basically it's like basically a series of vignettes and kind of that kind of thing for at least for now because the overarching overarching story you don't you don't really get to that until later and I haven't gone that far yet but let me see what because actually the system map is a little bit interesting because it's actually a hex map where you have to lay down these like you get like a like little things of hexes that you have to put down and and to get through the other areas and there's colors and everything like that

324
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,785
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a fairly interesting game.

325
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:33,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you can also play dress-up with the characters because you can actually buy all these different sort of clothes.

326
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:37,258
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not a JRPG if there's not dress-up at some point.

327
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:41,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the box for the new Xbox 360 controller.

328
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:41,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

329
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:58,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, a question about Game Room.

330
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:00,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma says, didn't Sunset Riders drop too?

331
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:03,038
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's rumored that that is in the game pack.

332
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:03,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what came out.

333
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:05,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulled up the list while Arcadian was talking there.

334
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:17,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Daytona Twinbee, Puyen, Thwocker, Amidar, Off the Wall, Twinbee, Blades of Steel, Pitfall 2, Trick Trap, and Vectron have all come out in the past three weeks.

335
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:22,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Mainly I hadn't checked them out because they stopped updating their Facebook thing because of all the...

336
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:25,716
[SPEAKER_02]: All the closures and stuff, so it kind of makes you forget to look.

337
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:29,338
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one thing about the new controller that I didn't mention.

338
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:37,403
[SPEAKER_07]: The analog sticks have this little lip in them, so it might kind of hurt your finger a little bit more than the old one.

339
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:44,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially with Super Meatball, where you're jamming the controller left and right and up and down all the time, that can kind of bite into your finger a bit.

340
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:48,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcadian, you're kind of known as being a quiet guy.

341
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:55,092
[SPEAKER_02]: You're playing games, but usually you're quiet and you don't yell.

342
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:57,493
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not obnoxious like I am in crowds.

343
00:21:58,313 --> 00:22:04,956
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to ask, when you play Super Meat Boy, are you the type that just starts, fuck, I can't fucking believe I lost that level.

344
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:05,636
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn.

345
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:07,577
[SPEAKER_02]: and you throw the controller against the ground

346
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:32,552
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like, every time it was like just getting killed by this guy over and over again.

347
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,013
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I got really pissed.

348
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,054
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy was making me swear like fucking crazy.

349
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:37,734
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

350
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:38,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, there you go.

351
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:40,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear that?

352
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:40,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

353
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Just thinking about it makes me fucking crazy.

354
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:45,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and the same thing with Kyle in the first game.

355
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:46,076
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy was an ass.

356
00:22:46,957 --> 00:22:48,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking annoying as hell.

357
00:22:48,397 --> 00:23:07,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Always the quiet ones, always is, alright But Super Meat Boy, oh damn, damn, oh well, shit And then go on and just do it again, because it's so fast, you don't really have to think about it, just do it again You have to ask Lasius Pop about when I play Super Meat Boy, it's pretty exciting In fact, he'll even egg me on, he'll be like, don't you want to play Super Meat Boy?

358
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:14,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Rob, you're so close to beating that one level, come on, you should play Super Meat Boy Come on, you'll have that level beat in five minutes, come on, it's like entertainment for him

359
00:23:15,814 --> 00:23:16,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

360
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:35,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

361
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:37,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

362
00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:44,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com SolarFlare says, I've been playing Resonance of Fate for PS3.

363
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes me feel like I don't know how to play JRPGs anymore.

364
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:50,955
[SPEAKER_02]: DungeonBuster says, Fate's battle mechanics take a little getting used to.

365
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:56,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I stopped playing it for a week or so and had to hit up easy encounters all over again just to get back into the groove.

366
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:07,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what other controller I guess had come out recently I really want to get is that Tron controller because the game came out and sadly I have missed the game although I hear it's not so great.

367
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:10,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the reviews are mixed at best.

368
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:11,863
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm still curious.

369
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:16,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked what I played at E3 so reviewers don't always get it right either.

370
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,047
[SPEAKER_16]: You're reading one man's opinion.

371
00:24:19,387 --> 00:24:20,368
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all it really is.

372
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:21,970
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a team of people reading it.

373
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,512
[SPEAKER_02]: What if it's Metacritic where you're reading several people's opinions?

374
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:25,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, big deal.

375
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,114
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a few people.

376
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:28,156
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, they're all over the board with stuff.

377
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,580
[SPEAKER_16]: There were some people that thought Gran Turismo 5 was awesome.

378
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Some that hated it.

379
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:36,746
[SPEAKER_16]: There was... I'm trying to think of one that had really weird reviews on it.

380
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:37,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

381
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:40,189
[SPEAKER_16]: What was it?

382
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:47,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Might have been Epic Mickey, because there were some people that really loved Epic Mickey and people that hated it.

383
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,578
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be like that for everything.

384
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:56,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, see, this is the weird thing, is that Tron Evolution supposedly has a 58 on Metacritic right now.

385
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:58,625
[SPEAKER_02]: This is based on six critics, but then I don't see critic reviews.

386
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:02,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes me think, okay, they haven't really...

387
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:24,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Had that, so I don't know, whatever I guess the movie only has like a 50-something too, so But people are dumb I mean, they're like Movie critics you have to take with a grain of salt My expectations for the Tron movie are very low As long as it's pretty and at some point I hear end of line I'm gonna be fine, you know what I mean?

388
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:32,301
[SPEAKER_06]: My expectations are set really low I can't fucking wait Six days, six more days I heard a Tron rumor

389
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:36,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Something to do with... Is this OMG Spoilers?

390
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:36,424
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

391
00:25:37,185 --> 00:25:47,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Something to do... I think this is how the story was read, but Disney is pulling the original Tron DVD from retailers because... It's already done.

392
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:49,376
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been in the vault forever.

393
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:50,958
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not going to release it until later.

394
00:25:51,158 --> 00:26:03,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I thought that the way that it looks on the box art where it says Tron, they don't want people to go, oh, this is that movie that's in theaters right now, so I'll just buy this when it's a completely different movie, I think.

395
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:12,066
[SPEAKER_13]: What the big deal is is that there is a remastered one waiting to be released, and they're not going to release it until after the movie comes out.

396
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:14,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You know a box set's coming.

397
00:26:14,587 --> 00:26:15,907
[SPEAKER_02]: You know a box set's going to happen.

398
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:21,730
[SPEAKER_13]: because they actually got the original animator back to go in and do all the touch-up work himself.

399
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,411
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that reminds me.

400
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:27,113
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to watch the original Tron this week again because it's been so long.

401
00:26:27,173 --> 00:26:28,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I barely remember it.

402
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:29,234
[SPEAKER_13]: I have it.

403
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:30,695
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Laserdiscs.

404
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:31,496
[SPEAKER_16]: I was watching.

405
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:36,278
[SPEAKER_16]: They had a really... It was on... I think... It might have been Gizmo...

406
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:38,460
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

407
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:58,761
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

408
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:23,930
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

409
00:27:42,041 --> 00:28:07,357
[SPEAKER_02]: um you know obviously uh they've redone all the old content and i'm hearing the worgen and goblin experience is amazing but um you know i talked about on the other show for a little bit my experience just going back and leveling a gnome priest which is one of the new race class combos that you don't need cataclysm for and it was neat a neat upgrade a lot of the mechanics from wrath of the lich king you now find in the classic wow and i think that's what's pretty cool because it

410
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:33,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Allows it to have more vehicle type quests and kind of zany things Like today I was in Oldham and I got a daily quest to do a whack-a-mole type of quest It's just kind of weird stuff and a lot of very meta things Like the whole plants versus zombies quest that they have now Or peace balloon versus ghouls, whatever There's a lot of silly things in it But the core game is still great And the end game, I haven't seen a lot of the 85 end game yet Because I'm only about 83 and a third now

411
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,325
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

412
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:59,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much roll your way through any dungeon.

413
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:03,344
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to take a step back and go, oh, crap, this is all new content.

414
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:04,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not overgeared.

415
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:05,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to think about this.

416
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:10,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as a healer, which I play in the game, they made heals very expensive.

417
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:16,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you really have to think about, do I really need to top this person off or should I go back to focusing on the tank?

418
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:18,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of interesting little game mechanics like that.

419
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to know more about that, I got the other show, so we'll talk more about that.

420
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:25,526
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as other games that I played, there were some free games that came out on Xbox this week.

421
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:27,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them, I don't even remember the name of it.

422
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:28,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in chat will jump in.

423
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:31,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one person plays a driver.

424
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:34,253
[SPEAKER_02]: You drive around the course and the other person can shoot the driver.

425
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:35,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Doritos games?

426
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's one of those Doritos games.

427
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:38,637
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds like an old arcade game.

428
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:42,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it not the shoot?

429
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,484
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like one person was the driver and the other person had the gun and it was a two person arcade game.

430
00:29:47,706 --> 00:29:50,627
[SPEAKER_02]: You are thinking about, like, I know what you're talking about.

431
00:29:50,787 --> 00:29:51,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Tango and Cash.

432
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:52,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Tango and Cash, yeah.

433
00:29:52,827 --> 00:29:53,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Press HQ?

434
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Or no, Lucky and Wild.

435
00:29:55,748 --> 00:29:56,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Lucky and Wild, that was it.

436
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:57,149
[SPEAKER_16]: My mistake.

437
00:29:58,849 --> 00:29:59,249
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

438
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:01,790
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I know what you're talking about, though.

439
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,430
[SPEAKER_16]: That was neat looking.

440
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid.

441
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:06,071
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free.

442
00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:07,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's free, exactly.

443
00:30:07,812 --> 00:30:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: It was better than Yaris.

444
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:11,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It was better than Totem Ball.

445
00:30:11,953 --> 00:30:13,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you download the other one?

446
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:15,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Avatar Crash Course?

447
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded it, but I haven't played it yet.

448
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:17,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know

449
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:41,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope maybe for the next year's Dorito competition we will have the Golden Girls with Guns game.

450
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:44,040
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just Grand Theft Auto with the Golden Girls.

451
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,001
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I really want to say.

452
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:47,103
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll have you know, Doritos are kind of orangish.

453
00:30:47,483 --> 00:30:47,984
[SPEAKER_16]: It works.

454
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:51,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Golden Girls lived in Miami, so they were kind of orangish.

455
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:52,187
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

456
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:52,768
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

457
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:53,689
[SPEAKER_13]: It just occurred to me.

458
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, imagine like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game or the X-Men game or the Simpsons, only with the Golden Girls.

459
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:00,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

460
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:00,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

461
00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:03,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, Sophia hits him with that giant purse.

462
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:04,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

463
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:08,037
[SPEAKER_13]: And, like, Blanche has the slut attack.

464
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

465
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:10,957
[SPEAKER_13]: And who is the Arthur?

466
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:12,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Dorothy, which is sassy.

467
00:31:13,258 --> 00:31:14,338
[SPEAKER_13]: She has the bitch attack.

468
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:14,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

469
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:20,079
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically, I guess, Rose would just walk through the game clueless.

470
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:21,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she has stories about St.

471
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Olaf.

472
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,140
[SPEAKER_02]: She has the St.

473
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Olaf special.

474
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,960
[SPEAKER_13]: She'd have a goat that would come out.

475
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

476
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:30,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think that's it either.

477
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:31,146
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like...

478
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:49,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Doritos!

479
00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:12,479
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm doing right now?

480
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually clicking to my profile.

481
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Harm's Way.

482
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,421
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the name of the game.

483
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:17,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God.

484
00:32:18,382 --> 00:32:21,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God for the Xbox.com tracking everything that you play.

485
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:24,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Harm's Way was the name of the game.

486
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:26,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Phew.

487
00:32:26,706 --> 00:32:27,266
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

488
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:28,647
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat didn't beat me to that.

489
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:31,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually having the live chat room, some people jump in with a game.

490
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knew that game.

491
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:34,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that should tell me right there.

492
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,251
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because the chat room didn't care.

493
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:36,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly.

494
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:39,113
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's housekeeping real quick.

495
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:43,097
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

496
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:44,238
[SPEAKER_02]: We can always use some more fans there.

497
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:45,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Twitter.

498
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask us some questions on Twitter.

499
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,402
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to those in the second half of our show tonight.

500
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:51,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

501
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:54,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, let's get into the news tonight.

502
00:32:55,349 --> 00:33:02,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, of course, the ever-denied but absolutely coming PSP2.

503
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:07,218
[SPEAKER_16]: More rumors about the capabilities of it, since we don't know too much about it yet.

504
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:09,080
[SPEAKER_16]: There are people that are working with it.

505
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,584
[SPEAKER_16]: They're saying that the graphics are comparable to early PlayStation 3 titles.

506
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:33,717
[SPEAKER_16]: It says that the lower resolution screen will surely help minimize the quality gap between PlayStation 3 games and PSP 2 games, but they're saying that it should be rather easy to port PS3 games over to the PSP 2, which sounds pretty impressive, actually.

507
00:33:33,857 --> 00:33:37,839
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds dang impressive, but there's got to be a difference in quality.

508
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:40,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that thing's going to be Sport and Blu-ray or whatever.

509
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, here's the thing, though.

510
00:33:41,981 --> 00:33:43,941
[SPEAKER_16]: The textures don't have to be as big.

511
00:33:43,961 --> 00:33:47,063
[SPEAKER_16]: They can save a lot because it's a smaller screen.

512
00:33:47,463 --> 00:33:51,285
[SPEAKER_16]: The resolution isn't going to be as big as the PlayStation 3.

513
00:33:52,425 --> 00:34:15,545
[SPEAKER_16]: and because of that they can do a lot of tricks kind of like for example how they can do a lot of tricks with like you know Infinity Blade to make it look nice on an iPad or an iPod because you know they do a bunch of texture tricks and stuff to make it look like it's actually a higher resolution than it is and actually kind of the same goes with even just the PSP now they have a lot of tricks to make things look better

514
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:17,687
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I'm not too concerned about that.

515
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:18,588
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's going to be awesome.

516
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:22,232
[SPEAKER_16]: And as long as they have two dual analog sticks, which is great.

517
00:34:22,953 --> 00:34:26,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking about having more synergy between the PSP and the PlayStation 3 with this?

518
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:27,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when...

519
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,652
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

520
00:34:49,813 --> 00:35:01,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only would you be able to do that with... I'm assuming that this will also be able to emulate PlayStation 1 games as well and possibly PlayStation 2 games later on down the line have downloadable for it.

521
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:03,956
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that would be really cool.

522
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:14,158
[SPEAKER_16]: And then with the remote play, yeah, you would be able to probably play these games to their full extent because you'll have the controls that are going to be mimicking the same thing.

523
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:44,018
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever happened to I remember at E3 when this thing was first announced remember Ridge Racer and remember when they were using the PSP as like a rear view mirror did that functionality ever happen in a game like where the PSP was kind of your controller or your spin off device or whatever from the Playstation 3 like I don't remember that ever actually happening did that technology just not play out um maybe somebody in chat knows of the game I think they have had things for that but

524
00:35:45,498 --> 00:35:49,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily Ruby Mirror Are we talking anything like actually really cool?

525
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:54,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking like Buzz will allow you to use the PSP to buzz in?

526
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,560
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

527
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:10,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about something actually kind of different I don't remember Nothing really stands out How you could visit the Animal Crossing village on your Game Boy Advance When you played GameCube Animal Crossing Remember that?

528
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:10,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that...

529
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:11,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

530
00:36:11,985 --> 00:36:12,525
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.

531
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to cheat.

532
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:14,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

533
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:25,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a comment from our chatroom at chat.orangeonstranger.com GameGuru in our chat says, I'd rather hear about the price points of the 3DS than the PSP2.

534
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Any crazy idea what this might cost?

535
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,347
[SPEAKER_16]: The PSP2 I'd be willing to bet $300.

536
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:32,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Or $250.

537
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:37,733
[SPEAKER_16]: I think $250 sounds... I don't know, it's hard to say.

538
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:39,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Depends what they're trying to push on it.

539
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:42,418
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I could see it maybe as high as $300.

540
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:49,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if they're going to try to compare this, say, with an iPod or something of that nature...

541
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:51,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

542
00:37:01,337 --> 00:37:08,302
[SPEAKER_16]: I would hope it'd be around like $200 at the very most, but I don't know, it's hard to say.

543
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:14,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, nothing like Pac-Man vs. on the GameCube.

544
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:14,506
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

545
00:37:14,786 --> 00:37:21,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because there was that whole Pac-Man game on the GameCube where you could use, what, the advances, I think, as the controllers for the ghosts or something?

546
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:22,072
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

547
00:37:22,812 --> 00:37:26,695
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Pac-Man would use that because he could see the whole screen.

548
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember, but it was something like that.

549
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:36,634
[SPEAKER_16]: No, the ghosts would be on the TV because they would be split screen on the TV, I think.

550
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:40,478
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Pac-Man would be on the Game Boy Advance because Pac-Man could see the whole screen.

551
00:37:41,118 --> 00:37:42,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the ghosts couldn't see where you were at.

552
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:45,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

553
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:49,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if it's on the TV, then people would screen hack.

554
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:54,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And then BlackWolf continues to say it was just remote play where you could play the same game on your PSP on your PS3.

555
00:37:55,995 --> 00:37:59,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, not every game even does that back and forth either.

556
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:01,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly the PS1 classics.

557
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:02,779
[SPEAKER_16]: And here's the funny thing about that too.

558
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks to the hackers and stuff, they found out that a lot of games that don't support remote play actually could support remote play, but they just don't.

559
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:13,947
[SPEAKER_16]: They've hacked different games to support remote play.

560
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, isn't it usually a button issue or something?

561
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:16,228
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

562
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:18,609
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of sad.

563
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:19,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

564
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:24,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also, speaking of sad, let's talk about Final Fantasy XIV.

565
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:29,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's... Actually, this is kind of sad, actually.

566
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,271
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a lot of us said this needs to happen.

567
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:33,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the deal.

568
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:38,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV, obviously the PC version came out and it's been getting slammed back and forth.

569
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:42,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking about people selling off their stock and all this other stuff.

570
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:42,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

571
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:48,856
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation 3 version of Final Fantasy XIV, it was announced this week that it is not coming out in March.

572
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:52,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be coming out indefinitely.

573
00:38:52,218 --> 00:38:52,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they don't know when.

574
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:55,580
[SPEAKER_02]: They have now said this game has been delayed indefinitely.

575
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is like one step short of saying just the whole damn thing is cancelled.

576
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is very, very strange.

577
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:03,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's...

578
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:06,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what they're saying about.

579
00:39:06,326 --> 00:39:15,396
[SPEAKER_02]: The CEO of Squeenix, Yoichi Wada, basically apologized for Final Fantasy XIV and said that the Final Fantasy XIV team is restructuring.

580
00:39:15,796 --> 00:39:17,098
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be new leadership.

581
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Hiromichi Tanaka, the producer, out.

582
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:23,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Naoki Yoshida in the new producer-director.

583
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:26,726
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the other positions are being restaffed.

584
00:39:27,486 --> 00:39:32,730
[SPEAKER_02]: They are, quote, working on a concrete plan outlining Final Fantasy XIV's new direction.

585
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost sounds like they are just starting the damn thing over, which is crazy.

586
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, have we ever had a game...

587
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:42,177
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

588
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:18,521
[SPEAKER_02]: here's the great thing you guys after Christmas or even maybe before those copies of Final Fantasy XIV are going to plummet in price and pretty soon for about $20 you'll be able to pick up the game and play for free online indefinitely granted you won't be playing a great game but it'll be cheap

589
00:40:19,322 --> 00:40:44,102
[SPEAKER_02]: so there you go so that's really interesting to me I think I had said on the show before that I think I even used the phrase heads will roll at Squeenix and this was around the time it was the episode wherever the news came up about the stock getting sold I said that this was an inevitable conclusion that this is really an embarrassment but I don't know if I necessarily blame the producer

590
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,422
[SPEAKER_02]: who got canned over this as much as I blame whoever made them put this out at Christmas.

591
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:52,783
[SPEAKER_02]: This game was a year away from release.

592
00:40:53,463 --> 00:40:57,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of that year, the engine is pretty much done that the game runs in.

593
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:58,786
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics look great.

594
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:00,046
[SPEAKER_02]: The sound's fine.

595
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:03,848
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem was all the game mechanics weren't implemented.

596
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:06,469
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no fucking auction house in the game right now.

597
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:07,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

598
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:22,997
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the problem whatever executive or whatever decision made them put this game out this year that's who needs to be canned in my opinion because this game was a year away from being released in reality and so now it's back to the drawing board

599
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:40,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it just seemed like with them releasing it in September, October of this year, a lot of people were saying, well, it's kind of a shit circus on PC, but they'll work out the bugs, and maybe it'll play a lot better with a controller in your hand, and it'll be decent on the PS3.

600
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:49,565
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be some bug fixes, maybe a little major patch that comes out, and now it just sounds like, okay, this game is so bad,

601
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:57,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet that's exactly what happened and I think that it was this whole oh no we stand by our product we stand by our product thing and keep hoping and hoping until it said look this is your reality check bang bang

602
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:30,318
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says Rob, and don't forget the anti-addiction timer where they cut off your XP after so long I actually think a lot of that shit's been overblown because guess what?

603
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:34,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Warcraft has something similar, but no one's talking about it.

604
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:37,429
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft has something very similar.

605
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:44,374
[SPEAKER_06]: The WoW forums are filled of bitter, sour tears of the crying, the anger.

606
00:42:44,654 --> 00:42:46,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the guild experience.

607
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,618
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only gain a set amount of guild experience in a week.

608
00:42:49,718 --> 00:42:54,481
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you what, after this expansion was released, I hit my week cap in a day and a half.

609
00:42:54,902 --> 00:42:58,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And your guild together can only earn so much experience in a day.

610
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:15,010
[SPEAKER_02]: and you get rewarded when you don't play for a while you get double experience so I think a lot of this stuff in 11 or I mean 14 excuse me was kind of overblown because it was what you could play like your character for like 20 hours in a week before you started hitting penalties

611
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,452
[SPEAKER_06]: My understanding with XIV is that it was the job system.

612
00:43:18,912 --> 00:43:24,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly what the names of the jobs were, but you couldn't min-max, I don't know, like leatherworking or whatever.

613
00:43:24,114 --> 00:43:28,637
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to trade your job out for something else and then level that up.

614
00:43:29,277 --> 00:43:39,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So they just wanted, it wasn't necessarily a OCD, please take a shower and go to bed type thing, but just, you know, it wasn't one of those.

615
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:43,264
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just more, you know, we don't want you to min-max one thing.

616
00:43:43,284 --> 00:43:44,545
[SPEAKER_06]: We want your character to be diverse.

617
00:43:45,465 --> 00:44:11,389
[SPEAKER_02]: diversify, diversify Ziba in our chatroom I think sums it up very bluntly with this one comment no chocobos either no mounts, gotta walk everywhere it's not so much that but it's a Final Fantasy game with no chocobos that's like that's like a Michael Bay movie with no explosion that's an Anne Hathaway movie with no nude scene what is this?

618
00:44:13,223 --> 00:44:14,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand.

619
00:44:15,784 --> 00:44:19,786
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw on our chatroom says, so Square Enix just pulled an NBA Elite and starting over.

620
00:44:20,106 --> 00:44:24,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda, except they did it about three months too late did they pull the game off shelves.

621
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:26,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Although they haven't really pulled the game off shelves either.

622
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the copies on shelves currently are gathering a lot of dust.

623
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:33,893
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

624
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:48,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, kind of along the same lines, not only is there news about Final Fantasy XIV, but if you're kind of fed up with the current state of XIV, maybe you should go back to Final Fantasy XI, because there's a new expansion coming out in December.

625
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:54,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's actually an official expansion, it's just one of those Uber patches that's going to really change the game.

626
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:04,342
[SPEAKER_02]: The level cap will be going up from 85 to 90, and there will be a lot of new spells and abilities, some new powers for blue mages, because they get monster abilities and so forth.

627
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:21,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and expansions I know are still coming out for this game They're not retail expansions, they're download expansions But this game's still trotting right along And with some of the screenshots you see that they pick You would think that this game is a newer game They really are able to still sell this with some pretty screenshots

628
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:31,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe Steam, whenever they have one of their sales, which is all the time, they have a Final Fantasy XI plus the XIII various expansions that have come out for it.

629
00:45:31,483 --> 00:45:32,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dirt cheap.

630
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:33,124
[SPEAKER_02]: For like $5, $9.

631
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:35,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it has a month that comes with it.

632
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:40,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, if XIV's that bad, check out the hella pack on Steam for XI.

633
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:44,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, XI's still cooking and it's doing pretty well.

634
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:46,873
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what XI needs most of all, though?

635
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:48,955
[SPEAKER_02]: To lose PS2 support.

636
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:51,646
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could, like, update the engine, you know what I mean?

637
00:45:51,767 --> 00:45:51,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

638
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:58,974
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, a lot of people with, like, lower-end laptops and things of that sort are able to run Eleven, you know, because it is a PS2 game.

639
00:45:59,354 --> 00:46:02,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure there's PS2 Final Fantasy XI players that are like, shut your mouth, Rob.

640
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:03,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know...

641
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:10,333
[SPEAKER_06]: To bring up City of Heroes for the umpteenth time, they just had a graphics update for Going Rogue.

642
00:46:10,413 --> 00:46:13,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an MMO that came out in 2004.

643
00:46:14,196 --> 00:46:17,518
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people that are on computers from 2004 that are still running fine.

644
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:23,782
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't update the graphics too much because you're going to lose your subscriber base that's been with you for six years.

645
00:46:25,523 --> 00:46:28,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it was on a PC platform, you still have that limitation of...

646
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:30,385
[SPEAKER_06]: We've released the suck patch!

647
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:56,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

648
00:46:57,054 --> 00:46:57,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

649
00:46:58,155 --> 00:46:58,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to redo it.

650
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:06,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I'm like, okay, now maybe I can get excited about this game because now they're going to put the year of time that it needed the first time into it.

651
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:14,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss the flawless, godlike square where even their crap games smelled of vanilla and sang hosannas.

652
00:47:15,316 --> 00:47:19,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they've made an actual shitbag of a game.

653
00:47:19,558 --> 00:47:22,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, look at all the people that still love Final Fantasy VIII to this day.

654
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, what a shitty game that was.

655
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:27,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, during the PS1 era, everything, and then Saga Frontier.

656
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:33,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just ruffling feathers, because I know there's listeners out there that are like, you shut your mouth, Squall and Zell are awesome, and Laguna, oh my god.

657
00:47:34,122 --> 00:47:44,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the PS1 era, you know, Saga Frontier, bad, Einhander, good, and just Square could do no wrong, Final Fantasy VII, and now it's like, this is what you've become.

658
00:47:45,255 --> 00:47:46,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at yourself.

659
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at your life, look at your choices.

660
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:48,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

661
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:56,605
[SPEAKER_02]: SolarFlare in our chatroom says, now XIV is so bad they are taking the guys from XI that made XI good and put them on XIV.

662
00:47:57,066 --> 00:47:57,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Great!

663
00:47:57,866 --> 00:48:03,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some of the changes that XI got five years too late made that game great.

664
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:09,236
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole level sinking, that's something that should have been put into the game about a year after its release, not five.

665
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:12,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you played XI for about three years and it still had a lot of problems, but you stayed with it.

666
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:14,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally got sick of it.

667
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:15,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, after playing WoW...

668
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:18,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't take 11 anymore.

669
00:48:19,524 --> 00:48:20,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I played 11.

670
00:48:21,225 --> 00:48:21,885
[SPEAKER_02]: For like a week.

671
00:48:22,245 --> 00:48:23,586
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I played longer than that.

672
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:23,946
[SPEAKER_02]: You did.

673
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:25,607
[SPEAKER_02]: You were like a couple months.

674
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:29,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I was the queen of doing all that crap on my controller too.

675
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:38,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I had all my macros set up on my trigger buttons and it was just that one experience that finally was the straw and I'm like, all of you people suck!

676
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:40,676
[SPEAKER_13]: And I left off in a big stomping diva huff.

677
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:46,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Solar Flare is saying, to hear that the guys that made 11 good are now going to go make 14 good?

678
00:48:48,308 --> 00:48:51,570
[SPEAKER_02]: WAKE ME UP WHEN A RELEASE DATE IS OFFICIAL FOR THE PS3 VERSION

679
00:49:14,144 --> 00:49:14,364
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

680
00:49:27,952 --> 00:49:32,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this is one of those warm fuzzies, and I really mean warm and fuzzy.

681
00:49:33,915 --> 00:49:36,396
[SPEAKER_13]: The charity Child's Play, we know of Child's Play, don't we?

682
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:37,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

683
00:49:37,836 --> 00:49:40,677
[SPEAKER_13]: They have capped the 11 million mark.

684
00:49:40,737 --> 00:49:41,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Not 11 million mark.

685
00:49:41,518 --> 00:49:45,119
[SPEAKER_13]: When I say 1 million mark, it'd be nice if they capped the 11 million mark, wouldn't it?

686
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,901
[SPEAKER_13]: We just got done talking about Final Fantasy XI, so, you know.

687
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:50,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

688
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:18,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Really is disappointing, but that's what happens when you live 100 miles away from where the fun's at.

689
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:22,890
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to go, but I had my algebra final.

690
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear it went really well, though.

691
00:50:26,272 --> 00:50:28,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing it was better than last year, which last year I had a lot of fun.

692
00:50:29,034 --> 00:50:31,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really happy to hear it.

693
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:40,640
[SPEAKER_02]: and, of course, hearing about all this money that was made just collectively amongst all the efforts of not just even the big stuff, but the little stuff, too.

694
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:41,501
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

695
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:55,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's unfortunate that CNN won't report this, but they'll talk about the Xbox gamer that beat up a special needs child for his Xbox, which, yes, was a story on this show about six months ago, I think.

696
00:50:55,128 --> 00:50:56,808
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

697
00:51:18,254 --> 00:51:21,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that they're still looking to reach that by the end of the year.

698
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:26,459
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great if they could top what they did last year considering the state of the world and the economy and all that.

699
00:51:26,479 --> 00:51:28,080
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very aggressive goal.

700
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:34,443
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think just taking all that into consideration, I think it's great that they've made it as far as they have.

701
00:51:34,644 --> 00:51:35,084
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

702
00:51:35,364 --> 00:51:36,284
[SPEAKER_13]: I definitely agree.

703
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:37,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very pleased.

704
00:51:37,785 --> 00:51:38,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

705
00:51:39,947 --> 00:51:41,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

706
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:42,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

707
00:51:43,649 --> 00:51:44,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

708
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know the thing of this.

709
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,431
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of ridiculous, but

710
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:57,271
[SPEAKER_16]: They have added quests now on the PlayStation Network for the rewards program.

711
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:02,472
[SPEAKER_16]: And these quests are basically to get you to test out different things.

712
00:52:03,512 --> 00:52:07,214
[SPEAKER_16]: For example, they have one of the quests that you can do.

713
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:09,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of think of it as achievements.

714
00:52:10,776 --> 00:52:16,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Check your pulse, which requires you to watch an episode of Pulse on the PlayStation Network.

715
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Or to play a PlayStation Move game, and you get the Move It quest.

716
00:52:24,782 --> 00:52:30,148
[SPEAKER_16]: or the No Place Like Home quest, which involves you visiting the Central Plaza and PlayStation Home.

717
00:52:30,469 --> 00:52:36,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So will I get, like, if I successfully complete a quest, will my PlayStation 3 go, it's dangerous to go alone.

718
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:43,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, take this and, like, give me candy or maybe a letter to take to the old woman so that she'll sell me, you know, drinks?

719
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:45,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't know.

720
00:52:45,986 --> 00:52:46,006
[SPEAKER_16]: I...

721
00:52:48,678 --> 00:52:59,046
[SPEAKER_16]: I just had to laugh when I saw this because it's like, you know, I can see one of the quests being, find a purpose, go visit home, because there is no purpose.

722
00:53:00,988 --> 00:53:07,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Really, you know, it's, what was it, salt, it's really awesome, or sodium one, I'm sorry, yeah.

723
00:53:09,077 --> 00:53:19,407
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sounds like that Home is so useless that they've added a layer of meta gaming on top of it just so that you logged on, you sat down, just, I don't know.

724
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:22,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't get dry-hopped by a furry.

725
00:53:22,692 --> 00:53:23,732
[SPEAKER_02]: You dance with a furry.

726
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:24,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

727
00:53:25,773 --> 00:53:26,074
Damn.

728
00:53:27,494 --> 00:53:31,216
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, So when will OLR start giving out quests?

729
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:32,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

730
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:37,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Go leave a five-star review for the show on iTunes and you get a sticker.

731
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:44,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Go tell something nice about OLR to a friend of yours and get a high five.

732
00:53:45,924 --> 00:53:48,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Get Permaban by DarkSakura Feat of Strength.

733
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:49,706
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only do it once.

734
00:53:51,826 --> 00:53:52,246
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

735
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,308
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want them to achieve that.

736
00:53:54,348 --> 00:53:55,788
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want somebody to achieve that.

737
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know that anyone's ever pissed me off to get permabanned.

738
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:01,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they have.

739
00:54:01,752 --> 00:54:02,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they have.

740
00:54:03,293 --> 00:54:05,314
[SPEAKER_13]: One person I permabanned.

741
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:07,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there might be two.

742
00:54:08,476 --> 00:54:10,017
[SPEAKER_13]: The other person, I didn't permaband them.

743
00:54:10,217 --> 00:54:11,959
[SPEAKER_13]: I just kicked them out the chat room.

744
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:12,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whatever.

745
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, our point is...

746
00:54:16,335 --> 00:54:17,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the reward?

747
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:24,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the reward just a virtual trophy-style thing, or do I actually get, I don't know, like a discount on a game, or a...

748
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:27,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, a certificate in the mail?

749
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:30,281
[SPEAKER_02]: A spot on the cast of Tester 3?

750
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:30,601
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

751
00:54:31,122 --> 00:54:38,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what the PlayStation rewards are is you get free PlayStation Network bonuses.

752
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:42,473
[SPEAKER_16]: And apparently they're for fans.

753
00:54:42,553 --> 00:54:45,335
[SPEAKER_16]: They didn't really say, I don't think, what the bonuses were.

754
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:45,736
[SPEAKER_16]: It says...

755
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:52,322
[SPEAKER_16]: The reward's free.

756
00:54:52,482 --> 00:54:55,304
[SPEAKER_16]: It says it'll be open to the PlayStation owners regardless of the plus status.

757
00:54:57,166 --> 00:55:00,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Think of it like Club Nintendo or Square Enix members.

758
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:05,332
[SPEAKER_16]: PlayStation Rewards is tiered, separating its members into three groups, Select, Pro, and Legendary.

759
00:55:05,753 --> 00:55:10,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Playing games, downloading demos, using PlayStation Home, being active on the PlayStation.com forums.

760
00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:18,683
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I guess at the end of the year or something they'll say, okay, this tier gets this, this tier gets that, this tier gets this, and be done with it.

761
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Wishings wants to know, how do you sign up?

762
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:27,792
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe you do with... I want to say they have their own dedicated website to that.

763
00:55:29,213 --> 00:55:31,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's take a look here.

764
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:37,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, while you're looking for that, Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, I think you would get a permaban if you left a one-star review, so don't.

765
00:55:38,216 --> 00:55:42,578
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you wouldn't get a permaban, but I'm going to bring Shermie over to your house and start talking about the tester.

766
00:55:43,138 --> 00:55:43,738
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'll do.

767
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:43,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

768
00:55:47,968 --> 00:55:51,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Xlink in our chatroom hypothesizes that you get a signed autograph of Kevin Butler.

769
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,811
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

770
00:55:53,991 --> 00:55:54,751
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure.

771
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:58,813
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't really say what it is because I don't think it's fully launched yet.

772
00:55:58,913 --> 00:56:00,094
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still in beta.

773
00:56:00,614 --> 00:56:05,436
[SPEAKER_16]: So right now you have to, they say you have to be a highly engaged.

774
00:56:05,476 --> 00:56:06,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably a PlayStation Plus member.

775
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't know if it's PlayStation Plus.

776
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,580
[SPEAKER_16]: It says you have to be a highly engaged PlayStation owner.

777
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning you gotta be posting on their forums and playing home.

778
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:20,542
[SPEAKER_16]: It says basically they offer similar features as PlayStation Plus.

779
00:56:20,902 --> 00:56:25,324
[SPEAKER_16]: It says the only difference I guess is reward is free.

780
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:25,844
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

781
00:56:25,984 --> 00:56:31,465
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a gimmick to get you to try all the stuff that they have out there like renting videos and stuff like that.

782
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:32,586
[SPEAKER_16]: They want you to try that.

783
00:56:33,146 --> 00:56:33,486
[SPEAKER_16]: No thanks.

784
00:56:33,746 --> 00:56:36,787
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Steam has something similar-ish going on right now.

785
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:42,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not quite as, you know, bold as, you know, trying to get you to go into home and all that stuff.

786
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:51,071
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have, like, these quest thing going on right now where you play certain games and once you get, like, actual achievements, like, I think one of them was for the game Droplets.

787
00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:54,272
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to get a certain amount of points and that was, like, one of four options.

788
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:58,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the other options was sign up for an official games fan club.

789
00:56:59,073 --> 00:57:02,774
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of them was something you didn't have to actually own in a game to do and then, like, other ones would be

790
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:26,739
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think what they do like they draw a name it's a scavenger hunt yeah that's what it was like a scavenger hunt and then like they draw a name from all the people who have submitted badges and you get like what is it like a hundred free games or something shit crazy that they do on Steam with their sales so it's this sounds similar except for the fact that Steam I know what I'll get like if I do enough of these I get free games yay

791
00:57:28,326 --> 00:57:28,686
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

792
00:57:30,987 --> 00:57:32,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Other stuff going on on other consoles.

793
00:57:32,968 --> 00:57:33,468
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the Wii?

794
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:34,808
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had a lot of Wii news tonight.

795
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:37,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Udraw game tablet came out not that long ago.

796
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were kind of wondering if it was going to be a hit or a miss.

797
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:43,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it might actually have been a hit.

798
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:46,713
[SPEAKER_02]: THQ has said that they are going to continue to support the Udraw Wii through 2012.

799
00:57:48,293 --> 00:57:58,596
[SPEAKER_02]: The chief financial officer, Paul Pacino, started to kind of give us some specifics as to what that was going to include at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.

800
00:57:58,996 --> 00:58:04,618
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that four to five titles will arrive from THQ in the next fiscal year, meaning April to April.

801
00:58:04,758 --> 00:58:06,299
[SPEAKER_02]: So April 11 to March 2012.

802
00:58:08,379 --> 00:58:14,381
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you don't know exactly what games are coming out, except there will be a SpongeBob SquarePants game.

803
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:15,682
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

804
00:58:15,982 --> 00:58:16,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

805
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:48,290
[SPEAKER_02]: so there it is otherwise as far as the other games go we don't know yet stop asking if it's Mario Paint just stop we want to see it happen too but seriously we haven't heard anything like that yet so just let it go let it go oh Mario Paint but it better have the music mode in it that was awesome-tastic well how about something different how about Kinect sound like fun

806
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

807
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:51,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't touched mine in a week.

808
00:58:52,642 --> 00:59:00,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the tech firm that made the camera sensor actually released open source drivers for the Kinect.

809
00:59:01,466 --> 00:59:05,969
[SPEAKER_13]: And that way means that basically you can do pretty much whatever you want with it.

810
00:59:06,469 --> 00:59:09,090
[SPEAKER_13]: It's developed, put out.

811
00:59:10,571 --> 00:59:16,194
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they said that the Prime Sense, which is the company that did it.

812
00:59:16,234 --> 00:59:16,854
[SPEAKER_13]: They're Israeli.

813
00:59:16,874 --> 00:59:17,494
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really cool.

814
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:18,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

815
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:21,977
[SPEAKER_13]: has set up all kinds of stuff out there for it.

816
00:59:22,137 --> 00:59:22,938
[SPEAKER_13]: So that'd be pretty cool.

817
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:25,059
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the OpenNI framework.

818
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:35,947
[SPEAKER_13]: It has an API for writing NI apps and offers middleware that allows RGBD sensors like the Kinect and lets you use it.

819
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:39,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So these Kinect hack stories are kind of a dime a dozen now.

820
00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:42,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, everybody's hacked their Kinect 10 ways from Sunday.

821
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of curious what this means.

822
00:59:45,432 --> 00:59:47,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, so there's an open source Kinect driver.

823
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:47,854
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

824
00:59:47,914 --> 00:59:52,036
[SPEAKER_02]: So indie game developers could use this sort of thing.

825
00:59:52,096 --> 00:59:54,898
[SPEAKER_02]: But this doesn't mean anything official can happen, right?

826
00:59:54,998 --> 01:00:02,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Because an official company would not be able to use an open source Kinect driver and expect to have their game embraced by Microsoft, right?

827
01:00:02,263 --> 01:00:04,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Microsoft already said they were excited about this.

828
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:08,005
[SPEAKER_13]: to see what modders would be able to do as long as they stayed within the law.

829
01:00:08,586 --> 01:00:10,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's interesting.

830
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:22,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, with that coming to mind, do you think there's the possibility we could see an actual big game publisher try to do something with Kinect on the PC?

831
01:00:23,352 --> 01:00:28,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe, but I'm more thinking that they're leaving it open for the indie type stuff.

832
01:00:29,374 --> 01:00:30,735
[SPEAKER_16]: There's other stuff happening on PC.

833
01:00:31,539 --> 01:00:38,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also kind of surprised though that with Kinect being like that must-have holiday toy, that they're not letting it embrace the PC side a little more.

834
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:39,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I get it.

835
01:00:39,522 --> 01:00:42,883
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not doing that because they want to sell more Xboxes.

836
01:00:43,023 --> 01:00:44,124
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going on.

837
01:00:44,564 --> 01:00:46,565
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm still kind of surprised they're not...

838
01:00:48,926 --> 01:01:04,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Outside of this one comment, it's not being a little more embraced because imagine if, you know, the people at whatever sales store like GameStop or whatever could more openly advertise, hey, this device, it runs on your 360 and your PC.

839
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:07,998
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play Biggest Loser with Jillian Michaels on your PC.

840
01:01:08,118 --> 01:01:08,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

841
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:08,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

842
01:01:10,012 --> 01:01:24,321
[SPEAKER_13]: My thought is that Microsoft is actually going to have some sort of cross-promotion going on between PC side and do something that's already optimized for PC, or at least quote optimized for PC, so that they can get more sales out of it.

843
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:29,564
[SPEAKER_13]: But then again, my other thought too is that if they were going to do that, then the holiday season would have been the time.

844
01:01:31,565 --> 01:01:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe next holiday, because I think this holiday they want to sell Xboxes.

845
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Gaming on PC, in their eyes, I don't think is very huge.

846
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:46,206
[SPEAKER_16]: People do it, but it's not like, you know... It's not like you have PCs in your living room.

847
01:01:46,246 --> 01:01:50,029
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't they keep trying with the games for Windows relaunches?

848
01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:51,810
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but that's different, though.

849
01:01:52,031 --> 01:01:54,993
[SPEAKER_16]: People have laptops, and people game on laptops...

850
01:01:55,513 --> 01:01:55,954
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.com

851
01:02:17,975 --> 01:02:19,936
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that they're really going to have this.

852
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:32,800
[SPEAKER_16]: They may have similar technology down the line or something that may be built into something like an all-in-one PC or like a laptop or something where you can do different gestures to navigate around crap.

853
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:37,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe like a new Windows Media Center or something like that.

854
01:02:37,882 --> 01:02:43,204
[SPEAKER_16]: But I don't think they're going to actually try to push the Kinect for a PC market.

855
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:49,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless they did have something sort of like you were saying for one of those, because you know Vista has all this ease of access stuff built in.

856
01:02:50,674 --> 01:03:03,489
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they could technically have, well, they'd already created, I'm not saying that Microsoft did this, but there was already a device that technically read brain patterns so that someone could think type.

857
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:05,630
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

858
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:10,853
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, it took them two minutes to write an entire sentence.

859
01:03:11,653 --> 01:03:20,497
[SPEAKER_13]: But if they had the Kinect technology set up, for say that you've got a quadriplegic, they can maybe move their head.

860
01:03:21,778 --> 01:03:23,919
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be the perfect type of accessibility.

861
01:03:23,979 --> 01:03:28,821
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd open up a universe to people who didn't have that opportunity before.

862
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:35,446
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's another reason why I'm actually glad to see I like to see those types of things come out And not just, you know, ghetto little hacks

863
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:43,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see, I'm going to the, uh, uh, chat room at chat.orange.com.

864
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:48,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Guru says, I'm still trying to find an Xbox 360 controller for the PC and not resort to a cord.

865
01:03:49,273 --> 01:03:51,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's difficult to do, but you can do it.

866
01:03:51,474 --> 01:03:55,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called an Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver.

867
01:03:55,716 --> 01:03:56,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you can buy these.

868
01:03:57,177 --> 01:03:59,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little dongle for your PC.

869
01:04:00,259 --> 01:04:03,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't just work with the, um, uh...

870
01:04:04,781 --> 01:04:05,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

871
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:26,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there like a little barcode on the back of this or anything?

872
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:30,935
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's called the Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows.

873
01:04:31,176 --> 01:04:34,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you take a picture of that and put it on our lovely OrangeLaunchRadio.com blog?

874
01:04:34,459 --> 01:04:38,103
[SPEAKER_02]: They work good for wireless controllers, which I use in my laptop.

875
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:39,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so that's what you need.

876
01:04:40,886 --> 01:04:42,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at Frugal right now.

877
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:45,310
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about $20 on various websites, so take a peek.

878
01:04:46,031 --> 01:04:46,431
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

879
01:05:16,363 --> 01:05:17,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's it?

880
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:18,323
[SPEAKER_02]: That is it.

881
01:05:40,848 --> 01:05:42,789
[SPEAKER_02]: DECA Sports Freedom Call of Duty Black Ops Dubbed Edition

882
01:05:56,676 --> 01:05:57,196
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those guys.

883
01:05:57,216 --> 01:05:58,557
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually a pretty big week in Japan.

884
01:05:59,297 --> 01:06:01,218
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PlayStation 3, many of those same games.

885
01:06:01,298 --> 01:06:04,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty Dubbed, Castlevania Lords of Shadow, Gundam Musou.

886
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:11,963
[SPEAKER_02]: There actually is a PlayStation console bundle coming out with Lords of Shadow this week as well because they love bundles over there.

887
01:06:12,543 --> 01:06:15,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Sports Champions for the Move comes out this week as well.

888
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:24,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other game, Umeniko no Naku Koro ni Majo 2-3 no Rinbu Kyoku comes out this week.

889
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:27,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what this is.

890
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:30,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Although one of the screenshots, hecka looks like Phoenix Wright.

891
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:33,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it's like the PC version.

892
01:06:33,372 --> 01:06:36,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this is an adapter or an adaption of the PC version.

893
01:06:36,713 --> 01:06:38,554
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an adventure novel adaptation.

894
01:06:40,155 --> 01:06:41,475
[SPEAKER_02]: But that does not look like Phoenix Wright.

895
01:06:41,575 --> 01:06:42,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Objection.

896
01:06:43,396 --> 01:06:43,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yuck.

897
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,657
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a girl who got stabbed with something.

898
01:06:46,157 --> 01:06:48,458
[SPEAKER_02]: This does kind of seem like a crime type game or something.

899
01:06:49,795 --> 01:06:52,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a different company's answer to Phoenix Wright.

900
01:06:52,577 --> 01:06:53,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

901
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:53,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

902
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:54,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

903
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:56,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to other consoles on the Nintendo Wii.

904
01:06:56,841 --> 01:07:02,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Monopoly Here and Now, the World Edition, because I know you're all looking forward to that, gets a price reduction this week.

905
01:07:02,746 --> 01:07:06,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man Party comes out this week, as well as Shape Boxing 2.

906
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:07,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii Day.

907
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:08,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy Diet!

908
01:07:10,438 --> 01:07:11,779
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really the name, you guys.

909
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:12,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Really the name.

910
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:18,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Going on to the PSP, Shining Hearts this week from Sega is the big release on the PSP.

911
01:07:19,064 --> 01:07:24,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, a variety of games are getting a price reduction, like Suigetsu Portable and so forth.

912
01:07:24,827 --> 01:07:25,228
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

913
01:07:25,928 --> 01:07:27,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Japanese releases.

914
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:30,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, for our friends in the UK, I've just got three things.

915
01:07:31,803 --> 01:07:34,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves on PS3.

916
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:36,224
[SPEAKER_13]: That's on the 15th.

917
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,305
[SPEAKER_13]: On the 16th, World of Goo for iPad.

918
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:47,228
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the 18th, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam, which is a whole whopping three days before the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 release.

919
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:48,529
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

920
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:50,470
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

921
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:25,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Where DarkSakura is going to pull a game from the archives And I will say, she did go way back in the archives this week And it's a game that even I remember And I used to like too I'll tell you this much, it's a Sega game Surprise But it's one that I remember We'll get to that in a minute Loki

922
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:43,998
[SPEAKER_16]: well there's still more progress going on in Australia to approve a new rating for video games to allow adult themed video games to be released in Australia I had already passed the federal cabinet and they've approved that

923
01:08:44,438 --> 01:08:45,739
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

924
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:21,663
[SPEAKER_16]: and basically right now they haven't really come to a conclusion whether they're going to pass it or not but I mean it's the federal cabinet thinks it's okay and gamers think it's okay so we'll just have to see it's a matter of time

925
01:09:23,499 --> 01:09:49,510
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they should I mean hell if anything you know Australia always seems to have like the cliche you know manly men and you know they're tough and the thunder from down under is that what you're talking about or not like not necessarily that but I don't know it just seems kind of Rob that's a dish it out back Astro Purview which I think is what he was referring to

926
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:54,411
[SPEAKER_02]: But isn't Australia also the country that bans a lot of games outright?

927
01:09:54,511 --> 01:09:57,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, because they didn't have this.

928
01:09:57,914 --> 01:10:02,118
[SPEAKER_16]: If this goes into place, they will have a way to classify those games.

929
01:10:03,177 --> 01:10:06,559
[SPEAKER_02]: SolarFlare in our chatroom says, Oh, I heard about this on Zero Punctuation.

930
01:10:06,639 --> 01:10:08,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Guy made a big fuss about it.

931
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't he make a big fuss about everything?

932
01:10:09,781 --> 01:10:10,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was kind of a joke.

933
01:10:11,122 --> 01:10:12,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

934
01:10:13,324 --> 01:10:15,405
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on to another story.

935
01:10:15,465 --> 01:10:18,727
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to do with the VGAs, of course, who were last night.

936
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,569
[SPEAKER_02]: The Video Game Awards on Spike TV.

937
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:23,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, you know what?

938
01:10:24,211 --> 01:10:24,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over it.

939
01:10:24,992 --> 01:10:29,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't really watch it because I know all the news is going to hit the internet five minutes later, which is exactly what happened.

940
01:10:29,555 --> 01:10:31,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly thought they were today, but whatever.

941
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:32,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoops.

942
01:10:33,318 --> 01:10:36,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see it just because Neil Patrick Harris is going to be hosting it, and he's awesome.

943
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:39,132
[SPEAKER_16]: How can they make the VGAs more tolerable?

944
01:10:39,954 --> 01:10:40,956
[SPEAKER_02]: More Neil Patrick Harris?

945
01:10:42,044 --> 01:10:42,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

946
01:10:42,664 --> 01:10:45,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, I think they should just stop trying to make it cool.

947
01:10:46,265 --> 01:10:51,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when people who don't... There's so many people, I think, that try to make the VGAs cool.

948
01:10:52,307 --> 01:10:54,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is cool, you guys.

949
01:10:54,508 --> 01:10:58,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do this really cool segment of a dick and fart joke.

950
01:10:58,089 --> 01:10:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be really funny.

951
01:10:59,069 --> 01:11:01,570
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know anything about video games.

952
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,351
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just trying to make it like the MTV Movie Awards.

953
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:05,611
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what's sad?

954
01:11:05,932 --> 01:11:07,272
[SPEAKER_16]: They do a better job than G4 does.

955
01:11:07,572 --> 01:11:08,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Best Episodes of Cheaters!

956
01:11:31,352 --> 01:11:38,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, there were some pretty big stories that came out of the VGAs, even though, you know, most of it was, like, just little teases.

957
01:11:39,414 --> 01:11:42,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Just little teases, like, I know something you don't know.

958
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:47,597
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the big trailers, of course, was Elder Scrolls V, Skyrim.

959
01:11:48,677 --> 01:11:53,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a damn piece of gameplay in the trailer, just some dragon waking up and, you know, narration.

960
01:11:54,219 --> 01:11:55,839
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was enough for me to go, what?

961
01:11:57,239 --> 01:11:59,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Was the dragon waking up and narration going...

962
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, I'm a dragon.

963
01:12:01,061 --> 01:12:01,902
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm waking up.

964
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:04,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Time for another Elder Scrolls game.

965
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:05,304
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

966
01:12:06,024 --> 01:12:06,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.

967
01:12:07,265 --> 01:12:09,806
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly actually what it sounded like.

968
01:12:09,866 --> 01:12:10,547
[SPEAKER_02]: No, here, I'll play.

969
01:12:11,187 --> 01:12:13,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I happen to have a link to the trailer right here.

970
01:12:13,148 --> 01:12:14,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I can play a little bit for you.

971
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:15,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a dragon, y'all.

972
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:17,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waking up.

973
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:19,272
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?

974
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:19,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing like that.

975
01:12:20,032 --> 01:12:20,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

976
01:12:20,573 --> 01:12:21,733
[SPEAKER_15]: New Elder Scrolls.

977
01:12:21,954 --> 01:12:22,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

978
01:12:23,953 --> 01:12:24,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

979
01:12:24,614 --> 01:12:29,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to play some of the trailer here and the stupid website's like, what's your date of birth?

980
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:33,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the content here... No, it's not really the world premiere here, you guys.

981
01:12:34,245 --> 01:12:39,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I can... Can I jump forward and just play... I hate live radio sometimes.

982
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:40,292
[SPEAKER_02]: This is stupid.

983
01:12:45,799 --> 01:12:46,240
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

984
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:47,001
[SPEAKER_02]: See, look.

985
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:48,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Stone stuff.

986
01:12:50,205 --> 01:12:51,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And a Bethesda logo.

987
01:12:51,386 --> 01:12:52,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And really passionate narration.

988
01:12:58,991 --> 01:12:59,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Harry Potter!

989
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:02,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?

990
01:13:06,313 --> 01:13:07,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, there it is.

991
01:13:07,153 --> 01:13:09,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out on November 11th, 2011.

992
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:11,715
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they announced as their release date.

993
01:13:11,775 --> 01:13:13,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck meeting that release date.

994
01:13:13,595 --> 01:13:22,718
[SPEAKER_16]: That sounds like a very specific release date and not something that they made to plan a gimmick of a year or anything like that.

995
01:13:23,035 --> 01:13:27,436
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, Loki should totally be the voice of a gay dragon in a video game.

996
01:13:27,996 --> 01:13:29,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he should.

997
01:13:29,857 --> 01:13:32,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this as a grassroots campaign.

998
01:13:32,938 --> 01:13:33,278
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

999
01:13:33,478 --> 01:13:35,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you need to be a gay dragon.

1000
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:39,199
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just a... Has anyone watched Family Guy?

1001
01:13:39,219 --> 01:13:40,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have something against it?

1002
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:44,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Do they not know of, like, was it the one guy who talks in there all the time?

1003
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:48,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I'm a bee, you know, I might sting you.

1004
01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:50,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I've stung myself.

1005
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:52,191
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I was mocking.

1006
01:13:52,271 --> 01:13:54,912
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I am not playing a gay dragon in anything.

1007
01:13:54,932 --> 01:13:56,353
[SPEAKER_16]: That's dumb.

1008
01:13:56,513 --> 01:13:58,654
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just like people trying to get me to be the voice of Tingle.

1009
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,054
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not gonna happen.

1010
01:14:00,294 --> 01:14:00,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I enjoy it.

1011
01:14:00,995 --> 01:14:05,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Or dressing up like Tingle, or anything that has to do with Tingle, because that character's retarded.

1012
01:14:06,057 --> 01:14:13,020
[SPEAKER_16]: If they make some sort of Epic Mickey type game with all the Nintendo characters, then yeah, he'll be in there with, what was that, Captain Rainbow.

1013
01:14:14,605 --> 01:14:16,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, anybody remember Captain Rainbow?

1014
01:14:16,846 --> 01:14:17,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I didn't think so.

1015
01:14:19,067 --> 01:14:22,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoyed the Family Guy parody of aliens that had that character in it.

1016
01:14:23,569 --> 01:14:25,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're trying to escape with that little girl.

1017
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna bite you with my second face now.

1018
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:30,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no!

1019
01:14:30,792 --> 01:14:31,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the airlock!

1020
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no!

1021
01:14:33,933 --> 01:14:34,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to see that now.

1022
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:38,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Salacious Pop needs to be the gay dragon.

1023
01:14:38,069 --> 01:14:39,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be a gay dragon, Salacious Pop?

1024
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:40,269
[SPEAKER_02]: He's nodding.

1025
01:14:40,289 --> 01:14:41,169
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd do the gay dragon.

1026
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:41,750
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1027
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:42,810
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1028
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:47,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tigerclaw is saying, isn't it 11-1-11, which is a Tuesday?

1029
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:49,632
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to come out then anyway.

1030
01:14:50,172 --> 01:14:51,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get delayed.

1031
01:14:51,452 --> 01:14:52,553
[SPEAKER_02]: These games always do.

1032
01:14:52,913 --> 01:14:53,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, though.

1033
01:14:54,153 --> 01:15:00,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite the fact that the trailer didn't show us really anything new, I'm just happy that it wasn't a trailer for a multiplayer Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

1034
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:04,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, that would have been kind of cool like four years ago.

1035
01:15:05,289 --> 01:15:07,292
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's time to move on to a new game.

1036
01:15:07,352 --> 01:15:09,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited.

1037
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, some other things that were revealed to the VGAs.

1038
01:15:11,721 --> 01:15:14,363
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a Mortal Kombat game on the PlayStation 3.

1039
01:15:14,463 --> 01:15:15,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, we already knew that.

1040
01:15:16,104 --> 01:15:17,744
[SPEAKER_02]: But this trailer had Kratos in it.

1041
01:15:18,025 --> 01:15:22,867
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, Kratos is going to be a playable character in Mortal Kombat on the PS3.

1042
01:15:23,768 --> 01:15:26,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So now him and Scorpion can just keep driving hooks into each other.

1043
01:15:26,969 --> 01:15:27,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be fun.

1044
01:15:29,991 --> 01:15:33,713
[SPEAKER_13]: All they need is Pinhead from Hellraiser to come out and it'll be hook-tastic.

1045
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:42,939
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I heard the news that Kratos was in it, that was exactly the thought that came to my mind was, get over here!

1046
01:15:42,959 --> 01:15:43,779
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you get over here!

1047
01:15:43,879 --> 01:15:44,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Get over here!

1048
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:46,740
[SPEAKER_10]: I will take you both to hell.

1049
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,900
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the trailer was.

1050
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Was him and Scorpion fighting.

1051
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:52,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Mass Effect 3.

1052
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:56,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a trailer for it, and it's coming out holiday 2011.

1053
01:15:58,402 --> 01:16:00,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure a lot of fanboy...

1054
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:05,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Excitement going on over that one because Mass Effect is a very popular series.

1055
01:16:06,955 --> 01:16:07,335
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

1056
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:11,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get into the classic game of the week.

1057
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a segment here on the show.

1058
01:16:14,822 --> 01:16:16,263
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take a look at gaming's past.

1059
01:16:16,483 --> 01:16:22,528
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, screw this Elder Scrolls V jib jab and all this talk of Kratos.

1060
01:16:23,229 --> 01:16:23,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, kids!

1061
01:16:24,089 --> 01:16:26,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Newfound, fangled game characters.

1062
01:16:26,551 --> 01:16:27,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a time...

1063
01:16:28,753 --> 01:16:31,355
[SPEAKER_02]: When they look pixelated and we liked it, right, DarkSakura?

1064
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:32,255
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the classic game of the week?

1065
01:16:32,275 --> 01:16:32,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we did.

1066
01:16:33,696 --> 01:16:36,998
[SPEAKER_13]: The classic game of the week is Wonder Boy in Monsterland.

1067
01:16:38,338 --> 01:16:40,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh.

1068
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,221
[SPEAKER_13]: It was put out by Westone.

1069
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:44,622
[SPEAKER_13]: It came out on the Master System.

1070
01:16:45,002 --> 01:16:45,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1071
01:16:45,622 --> 01:16:46,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Very loud.

1072
01:16:46,063 --> 01:16:46,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1073
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:51,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, it was in the arcades in 1987, but it came out on the Master System in 1988.

1074
01:16:54,428 --> 01:16:56,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Activision released it for the Amiga in 87.

1075
01:16:56,169 --> 01:17:03,574
[SPEAKER_13]: It came out on the Commodore 64, the Armstrong CPC, ZX Spectrum, and Atari ST in 1989.

1076
01:17:03,894 --> 01:17:10,799
[SPEAKER_13]: It was titled Super Wonder Boy Monster World in Japan, and then Super Wonder Boy Monster Land in Europe.

1077
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:16,043
[SPEAKER_13]: My cartridge of this says Super Wonder Boy Super Monster Land.

1078
01:17:17,203 --> 01:17:18,824
[SPEAKER_13]: So, inconsistent, I don't know.

1079
01:17:20,365 --> 01:17:28,048
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually was retooled for the Famicom by Jaleco, and it was redone as a version of Journey to the West.

1080
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:36,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Hudson Soft brought it out for Famicom and PC Engine to be like Bikuriman, I guess.

1081
01:17:37,516 --> 01:17:45,499
[SPEAKER_13]: It came out in Brazil as Monica no Castelo do Dragao, I guess.

1082
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,479
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't speak Portuguese.

1083
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,841
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do know that they speak Portuguese in Brazil.

1084
01:17:50,201 --> 01:17:50,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1085
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:56,643
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was actually based off of the Monica's Gang comics that were in Brazil.

1086
01:17:57,333 --> 01:18:04,018
[SPEAKER_13]: and it came out on mobile phones in 2005 and for the virtual console in 2008 in Japan and 2009 over here and in Europe.

1087
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:18,409
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a sequel to the 1986 game Wonder Boy and it's 11 years after that game where everything is peaceful and the evil King Tom Tom basically was gone.

1088
01:18:19,169 --> 01:18:24,613
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Wonder Boy, a fire-breathing dragon, showed up

1089
01:18:26,054 --> 01:18:32,217
[SPEAKER_13]: and basically wanted to go in and conquer Wonderland, turning it into Monsterland and crap happened.

1090
01:18:32,237 --> 01:18:35,778
[SPEAKER_13]: So Wonderboy popped up and he's like, okay, I'll kill the Mecha Dragon.

1091
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:37,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

1092
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:42,521
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyway, a lot of this is like, I never cared about the story when I was playing this.

1093
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:44,882
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, yeah, got a sword.

1094
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:54,953
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyway, it had some slow load times on the computers, had some issues, but it was super fun.

1095
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:59,820
[SPEAKER_13]: The Master System version is indeed the best home version that there is.

1096
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:02,703
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, and that of many others.

1097
01:19:03,704 --> 01:19:10,988
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, the way that it plays is you actually start off in the City of Wonder without anything.

1098
01:19:11,989 --> 01:19:15,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but the city's mayor gives you a sword and a revival potion and off you go!

1099
01:19:16,111 --> 01:19:17,171
[SPEAKER_13]: It has 12 levels.

1100
01:19:17,872 --> 01:19:21,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Each of them have its own neat features and monsters and crap.

1101
01:19:22,074 --> 01:19:28,798
[SPEAKER_13]: You use a D-pad to move around and you've got magic weapons that you can select and all kinds of skipping and jumping and smiting things.

1102
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:35,741
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a life meter that is red hearts, the more you can build them up as you go.

1103
01:19:35,761 --> 01:19:40,763
[SPEAKER_13]: You start off with five, and when you hit damage they turn black, kind of like Zelda.

1104
01:19:41,723 --> 01:19:48,846
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can get gold by killing things, because apparently when monsters die they bark gold.

1105
01:19:49,686 --> 01:19:53,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you can hit trees and clouds, because gold hangs out in clouds all the time.

1106
01:19:54,108 --> 01:19:55,869
[SPEAKER_13]: You also have an hourglass timer.

1107
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,712
[SPEAKER_13]: And when the hourglass runs out, Wonder Boy starts losing life.

1108
01:19:59,772 --> 01:20:02,974
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can refill it by collecting more hourglasses in hospitals or taverns.

1109
01:20:03,355 --> 01:20:07,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's always where I look for my hourglasses, is with some beer or sick people.

1110
01:20:07,898 --> 01:20:10,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course gold hangs out in clouds.

1111
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Where do the golden showers come from?

1112
01:20:13,922 --> 01:20:17,105
[SPEAKER_13]: On the ZX Spectrum version, you had a candle for your timer.

1113
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:30,435
[SPEAKER_13]: For the Master System version, you had a status screen, so it's just to show you what you got, how much gold you have, what your armor, your equipment, because I carry a status screen around with me all the time, too.

1114
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:37,700
[SPEAKER_13]: I just usually, whenever you see me drowning out, it's usually, I'm looking at my status screen going, damn, I need more stuff.

1115
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:48,186
[SPEAKER_13]: You also have the magic weapons, like I said before, you have bombs that roll on the ground, and fireballs, and tornadoes, because I also carry tornadoes in my pocket.

1116
01:20:48,866 --> 01:20:52,048
[SPEAKER_13]: And a thunder flash that damages everything on the screen.

1117
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:56,671
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically, there's lots of little secret stuff in there.

1118
01:20:56,811 --> 01:21:01,054
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like the character also, in his weakest form, is wandering around in a diaper.

1119
01:21:04,347 --> 01:21:08,131
[SPEAKER_02]: All this talk of golden showers and diapers is making me very sick, just so you know.

1120
01:21:08,891 --> 01:21:13,576
[SPEAKER_13]: But it is one of the earlier roleplay games, action-adventure roleplay.

1121
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:25,386
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty fun, came out on a bunch of stuff like I said before, and Wonder Boy in Monsterland is one of the, I'd say, one of the top Master System games.

1122
01:21:26,307 --> 01:21:33,352
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm really not surprised, you know, that it got its own special release in Brazil because they love the Master System in Brazil.

1123
01:21:34,172 --> 01:21:34,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my gosh.

1124
01:21:35,753 --> 01:21:36,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously?

1125
01:21:36,554 --> 01:21:46,380
[SPEAKER_13]: There's like so many Sega games were retooled, like Genesis games even, were retooled to come out on the Master System because they love the Master System in Brazil.

1126
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1127
01:21:49,783 --> 01:21:49,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1128
01:21:51,603 --> 01:21:53,524
[SPEAKER_13]: It did really well.

1129
01:21:54,985 --> 01:21:57,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Got some pretty high ratings.

1130
01:21:58,866 --> 01:22:03,688
[SPEAKER_13]: The lowest of its ratings were the Amiga, followed by the Commodore 64.

1131
01:22:03,768 --> 01:22:08,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Master System, though, really, really hit the top of the chart.

1132
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:15,272
[SPEAKER_13]: And there were other games that came out along the same lines.

1133
01:22:15,352 --> 01:22:18,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Monster Boy, Wonder Boy Monster Land, though.

1134
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:19,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd have to put that up at Pinnacle.

1135
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:21,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1136
01:22:23,129 --> 01:22:23,590
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know what?

1137
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,010
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to check my status screen now.

1138
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:31,751
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Wonder Boy in Monster Land.

1139
01:22:32,511 --> 01:22:34,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian, I know you like the Sega games.

1140
01:22:34,152 --> 01:22:35,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any fond memories of this one?

1141
01:22:35,692 --> 01:22:37,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only played this one a little bit.

1142
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:40,733
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is, before I played this one, I played the third one.

1143
01:22:41,293 --> 01:22:48,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the Monster Boy... Wonder Boy 3, The Dragon's Trap, which is actually one of my favorite games.

1144
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:49,575
[SPEAKER_13]: You get turned into a dragon?

1145
01:22:50,956 --> 01:22:51,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, he looks like Boba Boba.

1146
01:23:08,999 --> 01:23:14,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I only got to play this one a little bit, and it's kind of hard at the beginning.

1147
01:23:14,684 --> 01:23:16,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to grab the cartridge, by the way, and take a picture of it.

1148
01:23:16,986 --> 01:23:19,429
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the few Master System games that I remember playing.

1149
01:23:19,489 --> 01:23:21,871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was kind of excited to see this as the pick.

1150
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some of the chatters were thinking, hasn't this game been done before?

1151
01:23:26,075 --> 01:23:26,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1152
01:23:26,595 --> 01:23:27,656
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to check our wiki.

1153
01:23:27,697 --> 01:23:29,198
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been done before.

1154
01:23:29,378 --> 01:23:33,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and DarkSakura's yelling from the other room, it was Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

1155
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:38,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And Alex Kidd and the series have some similarities, but no, they're very different games.

1156
01:23:38,965 --> 01:23:41,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can always check our wiki, because I know DarkSakura does.

1157
01:23:41,446 --> 01:23:45,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she's at the point where she checks our wiki every... And tonight's game is already on there.

1158
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:47,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how awesome our wiki updating community is.

1159
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:54,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I do check the wiki, which is, I was gonna do Alex Kidd and Shinobi World, and I was like, you know, I had to have done Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

1160
01:23:54,575 --> 01:23:57,377
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will take a picture of Super Wonder Boy Super Monster Land.

1161
01:23:58,129 --> 01:24:01,971
[SPEAKER_02]: OrangeLoungeRadio.wikia.com is where that is all at, if you're curious.

1162
01:24:02,672 --> 01:24:03,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, we're going to take a break.

1163
01:24:04,493 --> 01:24:06,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It's break time here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1164
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:08,275
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back with plenty more.

1165
01:24:08,315 --> 01:24:09,376
[SPEAKER_02]: We have more news coming up.

1166
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:10,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter topics.

1167
01:24:10,536 --> 01:24:13,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your chance to get your tweets in at Twitter.com slash OLR.

1168
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:17,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR in the second half of the show.

1169
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Emails and so much more.

1170
01:24:18,981 --> 01:24:22,063
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1171
01:24:27,972 --> 01:24:30,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1172
01:24:30,413 --> 01:24:34,235
[SPEAKER_02]: We are taping live on this December the 12th of 2010.

1173
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:39,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you happen to be listening to us live so you can participate with the show.

1174
01:24:40,277 --> 01:24:45,800
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be taking phone calls later on at 1-877-GAME-OLR and of course the Twitter topics are coming right up.

1175
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:49,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Launch Radio isn't the only show some of us here in the studio produce.

1176
01:24:49,703 --> 01:24:51,664
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been trying to really sell our spinoff shows lately.

1177
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:57,069
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I do is called Horde House, and it was a huge week this week with the release of World of Warcraft Cataclysm.

1178
01:24:57,389 --> 01:25:02,253
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have some interest in World of Warcraft, don't worry, we won't tell that you're downloading the show and listening to it.

1179
01:25:02,293 --> 01:25:02,733
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

1180
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:03,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be our little secret.

1181
01:25:04,154 --> 01:25:09,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Just search for Horde House on iTunes or whatever favorite podcast program you like.

1182
01:25:09,699 --> 01:25:13,682
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really have an official website yet, but you can get all the podcasts at

1183
01:25:14,122 --> 01:25:38,278
[SPEAKER_13]: HordeHousePodcast.blogspot.com I think is where you can get all the mp3s directly if you're like ew I hate iTunes so that'll work DarkSakura has a show too yes it's called Comic Insanity as in the letter N with no I before it and we are on excuse me not on cough we're on infamous.net that's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net

1184
01:25:39,797 --> 01:26:05,300
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's me and Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow and we talk about comics usually we'll discuss the stuff coming out and what we've read all this month we are doing a best of like what was our favorite what was the worst you know how much Tiara is pissed off at Matt Fraction for how he's writing Iron Man he who shall not be named which I can say on this show Jeff Loeb

1185
01:26:06,821 --> 01:26:07,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1186
01:26:07,942 --> 01:26:10,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for ruining everything, Jeff Loeb.

1187
01:26:11,244 --> 01:26:14,606
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, talk about how much Rob Liefeld can't draw and all that.

1188
01:26:15,346 --> 01:26:16,827
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be some crossover.

1189
01:26:17,528 --> 01:26:26,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like your favorite fanfic come to life this week because one of the hosts over on Comic Insanity who's not Jamie wants to come be on Horde House and we're going to try to make that happen in the next couple weeks.

1190
01:26:26,533 --> 01:26:28,154
[SPEAKER_13]: That is so completely not a surprise.

1191
01:26:29,515 --> 01:26:35,858
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all a bunch of addicts, and you're trying to get me addicted.

1192
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:38,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Just pass the needle over, Rob.

1193
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Puff, puff, pass.

1194
01:26:42,642 --> 01:26:44,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll wear the track marks for you, Rob.

1195
01:26:44,983 --> 01:26:49,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, some rapid-fire news.

1196
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:50,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1197
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:52,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1198
01:26:53,774 --> 01:27:01,876
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is more stuff kind of coming... Well, at least this one is coming out of the Spike Video Game Awards.

1199
01:27:03,217 --> 01:27:08,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, earlier this week they announced that Uncharted 3 Drake's Deception is coming out.

1200
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:11,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we know that it's coming out sometime in 2011.

1201
01:27:12,799 --> 01:27:14,300
[SPEAKER_16]: My guess would be the fall.

1202
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:28,224
[SPEAKER_16]: And apparently the game will feature Drake and partner Sully on a hunt for a lost city and a journey that leads them to the Arabian Peninsula and Rubal Kali Desert.

1203
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:38,467
[SPEAKER_16]: And they said that the story not only lifts from the life of Sir Francis Drake, but also the British Army officer and archaeologist T.E.

1204
01:27:38,747 --> 01:27:41,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Lawrence, as in Arabia.

1205
01:27:42,308 --> 01:27:49,135
[SPEAKER_16]: and this was kind of shown off a little bit during the VGAs and also they had a preview in Entertainment Weekly.

1206
01:27:49,195 --> 01:27:51,177
[SPEAKER_16]: That's crossing over for you now, isn't it?

1207
01:27:52,338 --> 01:27:55,441
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, you know, the movie that's going to suck.

1208
01:27:56,281 --> 01:27:57,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Fortunately, Mark Wahlberg

1209
01:27:59,735 --> 01:28:00,735
[SPEAKER_16]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1210
01:28:23,502 --> 01:28:26,785
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a movie where he was with Leonardo DiCaprio or something like that.

1211
01:28:27,806 --> 01:28:28,927
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like some mobster movie.

1212
01:28:30,408 --> 01:28:31,088
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll take your word for it.

1213
01:28:31,369 --> 01:28:32,209
[SPEAKER_16]: But he was good in that.

1214
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:34,331
[SPEAKER_16]: But yeah, happening.

1215
01:28:35,772 --> 01:28:37,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of wish it didn't happen.

1216
01:28:39,235 --> 01:28:40,376
[SPEAKER_16]: But the riff track is awesome.

1217
01:28:40,596 --> 01:28:44,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously, if you got to watch that movie once in your life, watch it with the riff tracks.

1218
01:28:47,812 --> 01:29:02,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Other fun stuff, and this is kind of cool because it's been out on the PC and the Wii, but now PlayStation 3 owners will get the chance to play Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people.

1219
01:29:02,978 --> 01:29:08,940
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be coming out on December 21st, and it's also coming to Mac as well.

1220
01:29:11,422 --> 01:29:37,715
[SPEAKER_16]: um doesn't really say what the pricing is going to be yet but apparently um you know they're saying in comparison the PC right now all five episodes are um on sale for $29.95 so something maybe around that price um that's kind of cool and then finally Jacino Rama is screaming in the chat that The Departed was a good movie that was The Departed yes that's the one that he was in so um

1221
01:29:39,511 --> 01:29:47,534
[SPEAKER_16]: And finally, if you're a fan of Quake, Quake Arena Arcade is finally coming to Xbox Live Arcade on December 15th.

1222
01:29:47,994 --> 01:29:49,254
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can check that out.

1223
01:29:49,314 --> 01:29:50,255
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very similar.

1224
01:29:50,315 --> 01:29:52,355
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's based off Quake 3 Arena.

1225
01:29:52,775 --> 01:30:00,498
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first first-person shooter on Xbox in a very long time I'm really excited about and I hope other OLR people are going to play because I actually really like Quake.

1226
01:30:02,999 --> 01:30:03,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1227
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:06,800
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to get fragged, you have to let me know.

1228
01:30:08,658 --> 01:30:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other special features coming with that, or is it just like a straight-up PortaQuake 3, or what?

1229
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little different.

1230
01:30:15,562 --> 01:30:21,905
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of... It doesn't really say if it's going to be a little different.

1231
01:30:22,025 --> 01:30:27,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was going to be kind of similar to the one that they have right now, like the browser game, but maybe not.

1232
01:30:27,328 --> 01:30:28,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1233
01:30:28,909 --> 01:30:30,249
[SPEAKER_13]: What were you saying over there, DarkSakura?

1234
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:32,991
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, what if we want to be fraggled?

1235
01:30:33,274 --> 01:30:41,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe I'll have to get SSJ100Matt to get that little thing on his controller that plays the songs, and every time I frag somebody, I can do the theme song.

1236
01:30:41,801 --> 01:30:43,282
[SPEAKER_02]: We both clapped.

1237
01:30:52,464 --> 01:30:52,845
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough.

1238
01:30:53,465 --> 01:30:54,106
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1239
01:30:54,146 --> 01:30:54,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other quick news.

1240
01:30:55,207 --> 01:30:59,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's just sitting there going, I'm just going to play poker on my little iPod.

1241
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:01,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It's swords and poker.

1242
01:31:01,152 --> 01:31:01,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1243
01:31:01,792 --> 01:31:02,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Swords and poker.

1244
01:31:02,593 --> 01:31:03,353
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

1245
01:31:03,694 --> 01:31:04,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all, my bad.

1246
01:31:04,595 --> 01:31:07,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It's swords and poker because that's so different.

1247
01:31:08,901 --> 01:31:12,403
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new DDR game coming out on the Xbox 360.

1248
01:31:13,404 --> 01:31:16,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It will actually support the Xbox Live Vision Camera.

1249
01:31:17,407 --> 01:31:18,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, come on!

1250
01:31:18,788 --> 01:31:20,909
[SPEAKER_16]: No one has... Oh, no one should have that.

1251
01:31:20,929 --> 01:31:22,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the deal, guys.

1252
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:25,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much a port of the PlayStation 3 version, just without the move stuff.

1253
01:31:25,652 --> 01:31:26,853
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much what this is.

1254
01:31:27,133 --> 01:31:28,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even Kinect.

1255
01:31:28,674 --> 01:31:33,417
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just DDR, like you've known it, but not quite... It's not a universe.

1256
01:31:34,077 --> 01:31:37,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this is what that whole... Remember when they were going to reboot DDR...

1257
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,541
[SPEAKER_02]: It's new!

1258
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:41,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is it.

1259
01:31:41,223 --> 01:31:43,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's just kind of landing like a poop in the toilet.

1260
01:31:43,065 --> 01:31:45,567
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, that didn't already come out on PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

1261
01:31:46,008 --> 01:31:46,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1262
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:46,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1263
01:31:47,509 --> 01:31:48,350
[SPEAKER_16]: And no one cared.

1264
01:31:49,911 --> 01:31:52,714
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just Konami dropping the kids off at the pool.

1265
01:31:52,994 --> 01:31:55,057
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what they're doing at this point.

1266
01:31:56,698 --> 01:31:58,679
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, DDR fans, hope you enjoy it.

1267
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming to the PSN, Neo Geo Games.

1268
01:32:02,201 --> 01:32:08,385
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I kind of thought this was a dub because I seem to remember in the Japanese releases I was talking about a Neo Geo controller that was coming out for the PlayStation.

1269
01:32:08,805 --> 01:32:23,513
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever, some news is hitting out this week that starting December 22nd, the Neo Geo Station is coming out on the PlayStation Network and it will sell games for 900 yen for the PlayStation 3 versions of the game and PSP versions of games for 700 yen.

1270
01:32:24,794 --> 01:32:31,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's games like Baseball Stars Professional, Magician Road, Metal Slug, League Bowling, Super Sidekicks Magician Road?

[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically Game Room on your PlayStation 3 with Neo Geo stuff.

[SPEAKER_02]: All in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Neo Geo.

1279
01:33:08,136 --> 01:33:09,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you believe that, DarkSakura?

1280
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:10,998
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years old.

1281
01:33:11,638 --> 01:33:12,639
[SPEAKER_02]: We're old.

1282
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,320
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one.

1283
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:17,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, don't you have like several games?

1284
01:33:17,552 --> 01:33:18,333
[SPEAKER_13]: of Neo Geo?

1285
01:33:18,493 --> 01:33:18,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_13]: No, I have a Neo Geo, a Neo Geo CD, and one Neo Geo pocket, and two Neo Geo pocket callers.

1287
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:25,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So several.

1288
01:33:26,725 --> 01:33:27,586
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1289
01:33:49,383 --> 01:33:50,343
[SPEAKER_02]: and Duodesim.

1290
01:33:50,383 --> 01:33:53,204
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the new Dissida, the sequel that's coming out on the PSP.

1291
01:33:53,584 --> 01:34:00,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It was announced in Shonen Jump, a weekly magazine in Japan, that Laguna is going to be one of the new characters.

1292
01:34:00,387 --> 01:34:01,867
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of rad, actually.

1293
01:34:02,347 --> 01:34:03,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Laguna was a really good character.

1294
01:34:04,668 --> 01:34:08,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'm sure the Final Fantasy VIII fans will be pleased.

1295
01:34:08,469 --> 01:34:08,929
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1296
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:14,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how about something that isn't Laguna, Mr. FanboyWank?

1297
01:34:16,127 --> 01:34:17,728
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I did not like Laguna.

1298
01:34:17,948 --> 01:34:18,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Just saying.

1299
01:34:18,889 --> 01:34:20,930
[SPEAKER_13]: It was all about Irvine and his gun.

1300
01:34:23,292 --> 01:34:25,814
[SPEAKER_13]: But how about some Billy Joel?

1301
01:34:27,435 --> 01:34:28,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Kids like Billy Joel.

1302
01:34:29,457 --> 01:34:34,520
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently kids are going to like Billy Joel enough to have a Billy Joel pack for Rock Band.

1303
01:34:35,321 --> 01:34:36,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay.

1304
01:34:38,342 --> 01:34:40,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it have We Didn't Start the Fire in it?

1305
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:04,697
[SPEAKER_13]: and there are, I think, which one has the expansion?

1306
01:35:05,137 --> 01:35:08,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Pressure has the pro bass expansion available.

1307
01:35:09,683 --> 01:35:11,525
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know what?

1308
01:35:11,626 --> 01:35:13,508
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a song that I should send you.

1309
01:35:13,628 --> 01:35:14,890
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the best recording of it I have.

1310
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Weird Al, one of his live songs.

1311
01:35:16,832 --> 01:35:17,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it still Billy Joel to me?

1312
01:35:18,888 --> 01:35:20,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1313
01:35:36,111 --> 01:35:41,514
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really dumb, but a lot of work went into this really dumb project that they pulled off pretty well.

1314
01:35:41,614 --> 01:35:41,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1315
01:35:43,315 --> 01:35:49,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop was over when I was playing it, and you could hear the song playing, and he was like, ah, are you watching that video?

1316
01:35:51,081 --> 01:35:51,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

1317
01:35:51,962 --> 01:35:53,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I just was mesmerized by the next story.

1318
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:23,967
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to share with our listeners or are you just going to sit there and watch it?

1319
01:36:24,648 --> 01:36:30,110
[SPEAKER_13]: The next two characters that are going to be out for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is Crimson Viper and Storm.

1320
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:34,012
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't give a shit about Crimson Viper because Crimson Viper stands for cheap bitch.

1321
01:36:35,092 --> 01:36:37,413
[SPEAKER_13]: But Storm, cool.

1322
01:36:37,534 --> 01:36:40,495
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's even her more current comic book outfit too.

1323
01:36:41,255 --> 01:36:46,378
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is pretty awesome even though right now Magneto's kicking her in the face.

1324
01:36:48,859 --> 01:36:51,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Storm has a very impressive rack in this game.

1325
01:36:52,481 --> 01:36:53,181
[SPEAKER_02]: That's important.

1326
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:54,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes it is.

1327
01:36:54,882 --> 01:36:55,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important.

1328
01:36:55,482 --> 01:37:04,867
[SPEAKER_13]: But it looks like her attacks might be actually taken from her old X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

1329
01:37:05,387 --> 01:37:08,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Just completely done up and made incredible.

1330
01:37:08,929 --> 01:37:09,789
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really pretty.

1331
01:37:09,989 --> 01:37:12,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Her Ice Storm attack is really, really nice.

1332
01:37:13,611 --> 01:37:15,432
[SPEAKER_13]: And Crimson Viper is a cheap bitch.

1333
01:37:17,714 --> 01:37:20,540
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Her Face With The Glowing Feng Shui Eye

1334
01:37:27,335 --> 01:37:30,257
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be like 11 billion characters in this game anyway.

1335
01:37:30,317 --> 01:37:33,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Capcom, put in Strider, hear you.

1336
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:35,660
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

1337
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, look, there's Morgan's boots.

1338
01:37:37,061 --> 01:37:39,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Or give us just a new Strider game, The End.

1339
01:37:39,602 --> 01:37:41,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Or bring Strider from the NES to the Virtual Console.

1340
01:37:41,983 --> 01:37:42,283
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1341
01:37:42,984 --> 01:37:44,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that one, I'm sorry.

1342
01:37:44,285 --> 01:37:47,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but it was based off the comics in...

1343
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:49,527
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1344
01:38:11,393 --> 01:38:14,835
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm, wow, and dude, Black Spider-Man, that's awesome.

1345
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:19,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so how about some other, other, other, other news?

1346
01:38:19,156 --> 01:38:22,818
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is having to do with Fallout New Vegas.

1347
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:29,801
[SPEAKER_13]: This is, well, a bunch of, a bunch of fixings of stuff.

1348
01:38:31,024 --> 01:38:31,805
[SPEAKER_13]: The game is great.

1349
01:38:31,925 --> 01:38:32,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen it in action.

1350
01:38:33,246 --> 01:38:35,069
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got stuff wrong with it.

1351
01:38:36,651 --> 01:38:41,237
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fixes will now have is companions now show up as waypoints on the map.

1352
01:38:41,317 --> 01:38:45,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Companions will always fast travel with you unless told to wait or sent away.

1353
01:38:45,883 --> 01:38:48,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Download content error slash save corruption is fixed.

1354
01:38:49,286 --> 01:38:52,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Entering the strip after debt collector causes game to crash and auto save corruption.

1355
01:38:52,909 --> 01:38:53,629
[SPEAKER_13]: That's been fixed.

1356
01:38:54,090 --> 01:39:00,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Another fix is using the Mojave Express Dropbox can cause DLC warnings.

1357
01:39:00,154 --> 01:39:00,795
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fixed.

1358
01:39:01,355 --> 01:39:05,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Crafting menu now filters valid bright recipes to the top of the list.

1359
01:39:06,199 --> 01:39:08,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Weathered Pistol no longer glitches when applying mods.

1360
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:13,701
[SPEAKER_13]: And also quite a number of other things were fixed.

1361
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:18,862
[SPEAKER_13]: And lots of fixes for pretty much a ton of the quests.

1362
01:39:19,703 --> 01:39:24,484
[SPEAKER_13]: So, go update Fallout New Vegas.

1363
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:25,500
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1364
01:39:26,301 --> 01:39:27,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the Twitter topics.

1365
01:39:27,883 --> 01:39:32,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go check the tweeter and see what folks are tweeting to us this week.

1366
01:39:32,647 --> 01:39:34,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1367
01:39:35,009 --> 01:39:38,733
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to interact with the show, you want to say, hey, the Twitter's a good way to do that.

1368
01:39:38,773 --> 01:39:40,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with a tweet from Blue Swim tonight.

1369
01:39:40,535 --> 01:39:45,960
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember Blue Swim was the Techno Kitten Adventure tweet that started that whole stuff.

1370
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:50,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this tweet probably won't inspire an interview, but it's interesting nonetheless.

1371
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:53,647
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with a Kinect flying machine.

1372
01:39:54,408 --> 01:39:54,888
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1373
01:39:54,968 --> 01:40:08,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it's this whole thing where you have this mini-copter and it sees itself in the Kinect and it avoids obstacles by detecting them on the Kinect and it knows its own altitude.

1374
01:40:09,022 --> 01:40:09,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.

1375
01:40:09,703 --> 01:40:12,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's a backup motion capture device involved in everything.

1376
01:40:12,865 --> 01:40:13,826
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a YouTube.

1377
01:40:13,886 --> 01:40:19,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to mute Santa there for a minute so we can look at the YouTube here in studio of this thing in motion.

1378
01:40:19,369 --> 01:40:22,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess you can kind of actually see how the Kinect senses things around.

1379
01:40:23,252 --> 01:40:24,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there goes the copter.

1380
01:40:24,593 --> 01:40:25,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's flying.

1381
01:40:26,283 --> 01:40:35,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll buy it's lonesome and I guess this guy's gonna take a cardboard tube and like try to whack it out of the air but it's gonna know that it's there and it'll say like oh I better fly away from that.

1382
01:40:35,287 --> 01:40:36,167
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not trying hard enough.

1383
01:40:36,568 --> 01:40:36,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1384
01:40:37,648 --> 01:40:38,568
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs to be faster.

1385
01:40:39,369 --> 01:40:41,290
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do like real baseball with this.

1386
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:46,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a baseball just floating in midair and then just flack right through the TV.

1387
01:40:46,512 --> 01:40:47,732
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be more like T-ball.

1388
01:40:48,753 --> 01:40:49,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe in this case K-ball.

1389
01:40:50,153 --> 01:40:51,014
[SPEAKER_02]: T-ball, I like that.

1390
01:40:51,634 --> 01:40:52,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

1391
01:40:53,155 --> 01:40:53,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to Santa.

1392
01:40:59,442 --> 01:41:01,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, other tweets.

1393
01:41:02,084 --> 01:41:06,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Swim wants to know if any of us are going to pick up the Super Mario All-Stars Wii port.

1394
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:07,988
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1395
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:10,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?

1396
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:11,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?

1397
01:41:13,413 --> 01:41:14,433
[SPEAKER_13]: If someone gives it to me.

1398
01:41:15,174 --> 01:41:16,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to buy the Mario game.

1399
01:41:17,275 --> 01:41:18,136
[SPEAKER_06]: What, you mean the new one?

1400
01:41:18,476 --> 01:41:20,198
[SPEAKER_06]: No, all of them, again and again.

1401
01:41:20,218 --> 01:41:21,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Forever.

1402
01:41:21,298 --> 01:41:21,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Forever.

1403
01:41:25,549 --> 01:41:49,779
[SPEAKER_02]: some stuff from Spazinator is tweeting us to know number one two quick notes for us number one I'd recommend that everyone catch the last episode of FNG live next Friday it's a good show I am a show actually I don't want to sound like Debbie Downer I thought it was already over but if it's not then yes you should go support our buddy Bobby because I know he's worked very hard on that project and

1404
01:41:50,519 --> 01:41:56,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bummer, but you know what they say, all good things, dot dot dot, was the last episode of Star Trek.

1405
01:41:56,284 --> 01:42:05,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator also says, as self-serving as it sounds, and seeing that there's no official blog posting for it, follow me on Twitter for news on PSN video freebies.

1406
01:42:05,919 --> 01:42:28,793
[SPEAKER_02]: you know you should instead of doing it through your Twitter dude get like a blog spot or a tumblr or something and any idiot can have a blog look at us we have a podcast just go on iTunes iTunes is living proof that any idiot can podcast you can do better than Twitter Spazinator I know you can I believe in you do you believe in Spazinator

1407
01:42:29,673 --> 01:42:29,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh?

1408
01:42:30,433 --> 01:42:30,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1409
01:42:30,994 --> 01:42:31,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1410
01:42:31,974 --> 01:42:33,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, whatever you just said, Rob.

1411
01:42:34,015 --> 01:42:34,995
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was perfect.

1412
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:35,376
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fine.

1413
01:42:35,856 --> 01:42:41,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny T-Man wants to link us to, look, I found a Technokitten ripoff.

1414
01:42:42,339 --> 01:42:45,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, the clone games, I guess, are starting now.

1415
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:49,282
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a game on Xbox Live, any marketplace that he links us to.

1416
01:42:49,322 --> 01:42:53,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is Funny T-Man on Twitter called Asteroids Do Concern Me.

1417
01:42:56,645 --> 01:42:56,985
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1418
01:42:57,005 --> 01:42:58,366
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1419
01:42:59,136 --> 01:43:02,777
[SPEAKER_16]: That's actually, that was one of the indie games that they had.

1420
01:43:03,797 --> 01:43:04,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

1421
01:43:04,217 --> 01:43:09,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the levels are serious, but there's like this third level here that's unicorns and pooping rainbows.

1422
01:43:09,519 --> 01:43:13,720
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one of the ones that they showed, you know, as part of the indie games push that they're doing.

1423
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:14,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember right now?

1424
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:17,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1425
01:43:18,101 --> 01:43:18,821
[SPEAKER_16]: It looked interesting.

1426
01:43:19,081 --> 01:43:22,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there like a Raver Puppy Odyssey game coming out or something?

1427
01:43:22,422 --> 01:43:22,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1428
01:43:23,817 --> 01:43:24,818
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it can.

1429
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:25,779
[SPEAKER_02]: It should.

1430
01:43:25,839 --> 01:43:26,500
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

1431
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:26,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1432
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the official trailer for Asteroids Do Concern Me.

1433
01:43:31,565 --> 01:43:32,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

1434
01:43:33,747 --> 01:43:34,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Waiting to see some gameplay.

1435
01:43:35,289 --> 01:43:35,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

1436
01:43:37,491 --> 01:43:40,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is like the same type of thing where you use the button to float up and down.

1437
01:43:40,434 --> 01:43:41,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It just moves really fast.

1438
01:43:43,817 --> 01:43:44,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And you collect orbs.

1439
01:43:46,793 --> 01:43:50,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, this actually looks a little more advanced than Technogit Adventure.

1440
01:43:51,118 --> 01:43:52,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the meowing?

1441
01:43:53,241 --> 01:43:55,684
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess there's... Oh, there's some cute little modes.

1442
01:43:55,704 --> 01:43:56,004
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this?

1443
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:56,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1444
01:43:56,945 --> 01:43:58,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Double Rainbow mode.

1445
01:43:58,387 --> 01:43:58,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Aha!

1446
01:43:58,987 --> 01:43:59,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Double Rainbow.

1447
01:43:59,748 --> 01:44:00,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

1448
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:02,171
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it mean?

1449
01:44:02,191 --> 01:44:02,532
[SPEAKER_13]: What does it mean?

1450
01:44:05,183 --> 01:44:05,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Rob.

1451
01:44:06,404 --> 01:44:07,064
[SPEAKER_13]: That one's cool.

1452
01:44:07,524 --> 01:44:08,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Doodle mode.

1453
01:44:08,225 --> 01:44:20,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Noah's awesome, though, about that whole game right there as part of that trailer where they're like, yeah, we're sick of the people cloning games out there, and they show off the games that they have and the ones that they're pushing.

1454
01:44:20,934 --> 01:44:22,214
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of them are clones of other things.

1455
01:44:22,254 --> 01:44:23,075
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, here's the thing.

1456
01:44:23,115 --> 01:44:26,677
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why you can't call Asteroids Do Concern Me a ripoff?

1457
01:44:26,737 --> 01:44:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's missing two very, very, very important things.

1458
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the gameplay is the same, but here's the thing.

1459
01:44:32,021 --> 01:44:32,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Techno and kittens?

1460
01:44:32,882 --> 01:44:33,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

1461
01:44:34,162 --> 01:44:34,602
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right!

1462
01:44:35,443 --> 01:44:39,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It's missing kittens, and it's missing happy hardcore.

1463
01:44:44,085 --> 01:44:45,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody rave!

1464
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:48,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace, love, unity, respect.

1465
01:44:48,226 --> 01:44:49,386
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Starshine.

1466
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:51,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Such a great rave.

1467
01:44:55,151 --> 01:44:57,736
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, let's drop some E and make out!

1468
01:44:57,796 --> 01:44:59,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, you guys!

1469
01:44:59,218 --> 01:44:59,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1470
01:45:01,061 --> 01:45:02,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make some candy!

1471
01:45:05,219 --> 01:45:08,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll trade you this candy necklace for your candy wristband.

1472
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:09,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

1473
01:45:09,923 --> 01:45:14,366
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a big gust of wind gets caught in their JNCO pants wide like jeans and they blow off.

1474
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:21,272
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw305 sends us some tweets.

1475
01:45:21,812 --> 01:45:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Blockbuster laughed at a Netflix partnership proposal in 2000.

1476
01:45:26,816 --> 01:45:27,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it always funny?

1477
01:45:27,637 --> 01:45:31,660
[SPEAKER_02]: You get these hindsight as 2020 stories and it's kind of like, look who's laughing now.

1478
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,262
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the story I think it is.

1479
01:45:33,342 --> 01:45:37,988
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a part of the deal was that the Netflix brand had to remain.

1480
01:45:38,609 --> 01:45:43,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And Blockbuster was like, no, if we do anything, it's got to have the Blockbuster name on it.

1481
01:45:43,456 --> 01:45:46,380
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't think this is a viable way of delivering rentals.

1482
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1483
01:45:48,361 --> 01:45:48,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Fail.

1484
01:45:48,822 --> 01:45:51,403
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought it was a very small niche business.

1485
01:45:52,403 --> 01:45:54,784
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just some flash in the pan that's going to go away.

1486
01:45:55,064 --> 01:45:56,585
[SPEAKER_02]: DVDs over the mail.

1487
01:45:56,985 --> 01:45:57,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1488
01:45:57,585 --> 01:45:58,626
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like groceries to your door.

1489
01:45:58,646 --> 01:45:59,947
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some web van shit.

1490
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:01,307
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1491
01:46:02,448 --> 01:46:03,908
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on the interwebs.

1492
01:46:04,809 --> 01:46:07,650
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just college kids and junkies on the interwebs.

1493
01:46:09,907 --> 01:46:14,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Blockbuster so much, so I get the best schadenfreude from anything.

1494
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:20,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Blockbuster's CEO for types of cancer.

1495
01:46:20,132 --> 01:46:22,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, that's because you run Blockbuster.

1496
01:46:22,072 --> 01:46:22,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave it to you.

1497
01:46:22,733 --> 01:46:23,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow!

1498
01:46:23,673 --> 01:46:24,974
[SPEAKER_02]: That's vicious.

1499
01:46:25,714 --> 01:46:26,534
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really horrible.

1500
01:46:26,554 --> 01:46:29,776
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm being hyperbole right now.

1501
01:46:29,796 --> 01:46:32,537
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not all of them are corporate-run stores, by the way.

1502
01:46:33,573 --> 01:46:35,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's... Can I dig into this a little more?

1503
01:46:35,755 --> 01:46:36,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1504
01:46:36,155 --> 01:46:38,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you have such hatred for Blockbuster?

1505
01:46:38,837 --> 01:46:39,818
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to work for them.

1506
01:46:39,838 --> 01:46:43,121
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certain movies... You have a $60 late fee still, don't you?

1507
01:46:43,141 --> 01:46:45,182
[SPEAKER_06]: There are certain movies that they just wouldn't carry.

1508
01:46:45,402 --> 01:46:51,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if it was a rated R movie, but it was an LGBT-themed movie, like Boys Don't Cry with Hilary Swank, they wouldn't carry it.

1509
01:46:51,087 --> 01:46:54,670
[SPEAKER_06]: They just had this weird sort of censorship, like family-friendly stuff.

1510
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:55,290
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bullshit.

1511
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:56,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Let people rent movies what they want.

1512
01:46:56,591 --> 01:46:57,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't... Yeah.

1513
01:46:57,632 --> 01:46:59,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the showgirls with the bras drawn on?

1514
01:47:00,154 --> 01:47:01,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the copy.

1515
01:47:01,758 --> 01:47:04,404
[SPEAKER_06]: If they had a copy of Showgirls at all, that's the copy they would have.

1516
01:47:04,945 --> 01:47:06,669
[SPEAKER_06]: So Netflix all the way.

1517
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:07,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1518
01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:08,848
[SPEAKER_02]: $55 if you want it though

1519
01:47:33,324 --> 01:47:40,827
[SPEAKER_06]: That just makes me think that it would get really linty and cruddy because even if you use a mouse a lot, they get kind of gross.

1520
01:47:41,327 --> 01:47:42,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know why you'd want buttons on there.

1521
01:47:43,048 --> 01:47:43,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Not my mouse.

1522
01:47:44,028 --> 01:47:45,809
[SPEAKER_02]: My mouse smells like kittens and rainbows.

1523
01:47:46,489 --> 01:47:47,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perfect.

1524
01:47:47,049 --> 01:47:48,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you're talking about.

1525
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:54,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, a tweet from Gamer Girl who wants us to know, La Mulana rocks, just saying.

1526
01:47:55,885 --> 01:47:56,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, girl.

1527
01:47:56,526 --> 01:47:57,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, gamer girl.

1528
01:47:57,767 --> 01:47:58,648
[SPEAKER_02]: With your La Mulana.

1529
01:47:59,348 --> 01:48:00,189
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, our tweets.

1530
01:48:00,329 --> 01:48:02,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1531
01:48:03,532 --> 01:48:06,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft wants us to know that Netflix isn't in Mexico.

1532
01:48:07,256 --> 01:48:12,080
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, since Netflix doesn't exist here, I'm still stuck with Blockbuster and it ain't bad.

1533
01:48:12,661 --> 01:48:13,181
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't bad.

1534
01:48:14,162 --> 01:48:14,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1535
01:48:14,683 --> 01:48:14,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1536
01:48:17,757 --> 01:48:20,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, are Mexican blockbusters the same as the ones here?

1537
01:48:20,819 --> 01:48:21,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

1538
01:48:21,239 --> 01:48:24,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they still sell the candy up front as much as you pay for at the movie theater?

1539
01:48:24,961 --> 01:48:30,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't there be a 7-Eleven next door to get the same thing for a sixth this much money?

1540
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:31,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Just curious.

1541
01:48:34,192 --> 01:48:34,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1542
01:48:52,495 --> 01:48:57,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, so, of course, one of the highlights is how well did the Kinect do?

1543
01:48:57,878 --> 01:48:58,718
[SPEAKER_16]: And it did pretty well.

1544
01:48:59,258 --> 01:49:05,381
[SPEAKER_16]: It actually outsold the PlayStation Move 5-1 in November, which is pretty impressive, I'd say.

1545
01:49:06,241 --> 01:49:06,381
[SPEAKER_16]: And...

1546
01:49:07,762 --> 01:49:12,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, of course, Microsoft didn't do too bad with Xbox 360 systems.

1547
01:49:12,828 --> 01:49:15,611
[SPEAKER_16]: They sold 1.37 million units in November.

1548
01:49:16,452 --> 01:49:21,758
[SPEAKER_16]: And they said that it puts the Kinect bundle figure range around 685,000 units.

1549
01:49:21,798 --> 01:49:24,802
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Move console bundles around...

1550
01:49:28,887 --> 01:49:43,565
[SPEAKER_16]: 1,337,000 units and it says right now global sales have topped 2.5 million units and Sony has reported 4.1 million Playstation Move units have been shipped to retailers though the company hasn't disclosed actual sales numbers and

1551
01:49:44,566 --> 01:49:46,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me be honest here.

1552
01:49:46,587 --> 01:49:48,569
[SPEAKER_16]: 4.1 million and 2.5 million.

1553
01:49:49,089 --> 01:49:54,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to sound biased or anything, but you're comparing move units versus the Kinect.

1554
01:49:54,512 --> 01:49:55,473
[SPEAKER_16]: The Kinect, you need one.

1555
01:49:55,793 --> 01:49:57,614
[SPEAKER_16]: The move, you may need up to four.

1556
01:49:57,634 --> 01:50:03,918
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a little... Are they counting the nav controller on top of that?

1557
01:50:04,378 --> 01:50:07,540
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little wonky, those numbers, but...

1558
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:09,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuzzy Math

1559
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:33,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the top games, of course, for November.

1560
01:50:33,262 --> 01:50:34,282
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a big surprise.

1561
01:50:34,322 --> 01:50:35,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Call of Duty Black Ops being number one.

1562
01:50:36,003 --> 01:50:37,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, number two.

1563
01:50:38,684 --> 01:50:40,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Although number three is kind of surprising.

1564
01:50:40,205 --> 01:50:44,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Just Dance 2 is the top title for November.

1565
01:50:44,947 --> 01:50:50,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Followed by Madden 11, Fable 3, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, Gran Turismo 5.

1566
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:53,212
[SPEAKER_16]: NBA 2K11, and Wii Fit Plus.

1567
01:50:54,012 --> 01:50:55,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Because people still buy Wii Fit Plus.

1568
01:50:56,374 --> 01:51:00,517
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, with the Kinect titles coming out, it's no wonder.

1569
01:51:01,638 --> 01:51:10,204
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you're going to guess the best-selling title for the Kinect, other than obviously Kinect Adventures, because that comes with the actual units, Dan Central.

1570
01:51:11,345 --> 01:51:19,271
[SPEAKER_16]: It was the number 11 title overall in sales for the month, and the top-selling Kinect title as a standalone SKU.

1571
01:51:21,405 --> 01:51:21,665
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

1572
01:51:22,246 --> 01:51:24,087
[SPEAKER_16]: And who says music games are dead?

1573
01:51:25,849 --> 01:51:26,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who.

1574
01:51:27,970 --> 01:51:28,270
[SPEAKER_16]: People.

1575
01:51:29,151 --> 01:51:35,456
[SPEAKER_02]: If Harmonix is up for sale, though, that's not necessarily a good sign, but maybe this will help.

1576
01:51:35,476 --> 01:51:35,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll buy it for $2.

1577
01:51:36,977 --> 01:51:37,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

1578
01:51:38,338 --> 01:51:38,659
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1579
01:51:38,739 --> 01:51:39,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody in the debt, though.

1580
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:40,440
[SPEAKER_02]: They can keep the debt.

1581
01:51:42,077 --> 01:51:49,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, yeah, there's some... I've got a story, and believe it or not, guys, pay attention, because it involves video games and it involves pornography.

1582
01:51:50,030 --> 01:51:50,390
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready?

1583
01:51:50,991 --> 01:51:52,934
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with Nintendo porn.

1584
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, there's a website.

1585
01:51:55,077 --> 01:51:55,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of this.

1586
01:51:55,919 --> 01:51:57,081
[SPEAKER_02]: VideoGamePorn.com

1587
01:51:57,961 --> 01:52:12,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It received a notice from SciValence, which is a company I guess it was hired by Nintendo, saying that the site has been committing trademark violation because they used the name Nintendo to describe an image of a scantily clad woman who holds a Nintendo DS.

1588
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:19,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, chick with boobies out plays Nintendo DS, and now Nintendo is like, OBJECTION!

1589
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:22,976
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say Nintendo.

1590
01:52:23,156 --> 01:52:26,538
[SPEAKER_13]: VideoGamePorn.net Oh, are you looking this up?

1591
01:52:26,898 --> 01:52:27,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1592
01:52:28,668 --> 01:52:31,811
[SPEAKER_02]: We are an internet monitoring agency representing Nintendo of America, Inc.,

1593
01:52:52,268 --> 01:53:03,691
[SPEAKER_02]: We are writing to ask you to stop using the Nintendo properties in the hidden text, visible text, meta tags, and or title, and or other links of the above-referenced sexually explicit website.

1594
01:53:04,091 --> 01:53:04,491
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1595
01:53:05,512 --> 01:53:07,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Me reading this just by itself isn't working for me.

1596
01:53:07,972 --> 01:53:08,812
[SPEAKER_02]: This needs something.

1597
01:53:09,353 --> 01:53:10,033
[SPEAKER_02]: What could this use?

1598
01:53:10,593 --> 01:53:10,953
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1599
01:53:11,113 --> 01:53:11,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1600
01:53:11,453 --> 01:53:11,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1601
01:53:12,213 --> 01:53:13,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Play something sexy for me.

1602
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:19,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's customers include many children and their parents.

1603
01:53:20,141 --> 01:53:26,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Unauthorized use of Nintendo's trademarks and works is harmful to those customers and will tarnish Nintendo's reputation.

1604
01:53:27,124 --> 01:53:32,646
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to your immediate confirmation that you have taken the necessary steps to resolve this matter.

1605
01:53:33,047 --> 01:53:39,129
[SPEAKER_02]: To that end, you may email us at stopinfringementatcivalence.com I probably shouldn't have given that out, huh?

1606
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:45,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Please note that these are automatic email boxes, so typically no response is sent as long as the problem is corrected.

1607
01:53:46,186 --> 01:53:46,406
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1608
01:53:47,867 --> 01:53:50,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in other words, it's just like this whole automated thing?

1609
01:53:52,111 --> 01:53:54,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Click button, send cease and desist notice?

1610
01:53:55,314 --> 01:53:56,034
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome.

1611
01:53:56,295 --> 01:53:57,216
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.

1612
01:53:57,476 --> 01:54:00,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everybody in studio is looking at geekgirlsonline.com.

1613
01:54:00,859 --> 01:54:01,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I got bored of it really quick.

1614
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:02,240
[SPEAKER_13]: That wasn't the site.

1615
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,661
[SPEAKER_13]: That was just a link on the site.

1616
01:54:03,862 --> 01:54:04,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

1617
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:06,064
[SPEAKER_13]: It was videogameporn.net.

1618
01:54:07,386 --> 01:54:08,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see the naughty.

1619
01:54:08,627 --> 01:54:13,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at, oh, she is definitely using a DSI to cover up her naughty bits.

1620
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:21,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I like this because in one, in one picture here, she's showing, okay, I'm, I'm using the DSI to take a picture of my panties.

1621
01:54:22,136 --> 01:54:22,656
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that?

1622
01:54:23,016 --> 01:54:23,857
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one picture.

1623
01:54:24,217 --> 01:54:26,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in another, she's, she's using the DSI.

1624
01:54:26,519 --> 01:54:31,122
[SPEAKER_02]: She's holding it up to her face and she's like, oh, maybe I'll take an artful picture with my DSI.

1625
01:54:31,542 --> 01:54:34,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last picture, she's just fingering her pussy.

1626
01:54:34,424 --> 01:54:34,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1627
01:54:35,652 --> 01:54:38,554
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's no DSI whatsoever.

1628
01:54:38,634 --> 01:54:41,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, hey, I decided to put it away.

1629
01:54:43,698 --> 01:54:44,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess where I put it?

1630
01:54:44,758 --> 01:54:45,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a new toy.

1631
01:54:49,282 --> 01:54:51,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my mind, the jokes right now.

1632
01:54:51,383 --> 01:54:52,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, by all means.

1633
01:54:53,084 --> 01:54:54,425
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to ruin your stylus.

1634
01:54:54,605 --> 01:54:55,726
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to get another one.

1635
01:54:55,746 --> 01:54:58,248
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why she has an XL.

1636
01:55:00,603 --> 01:55:03,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Her belly button has very awkward placement.

1637
01:55:03,166 --> 01:55:06,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't her belly button kind of look like really left of center?

1638
01:55:06,711 --> 01:55:08,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, doesn't that kind of like look like a gunshot wound?

1639
01:55:08,813 --> 01:55:10,435
[SPEAKER_06]: That is where the stylist is right now.

1640
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:12,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1641
01:55:12,618 --> 01:55:13,679
[SPEAKER_13]: It's perspective, Rob.

1642
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:15,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Either that or bad photoshopping.

1643
01:55:17,864 --> 01:55:19,246
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1644
01:55:39,989 --> 01:55:48,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, it's already been going on here, but now Amazon UK is going to be paying for old games and trade-in.

1645
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:53,105
[SPEAKER_13]: You can print up a prepaid delivery label for your box.

1646
01:55:55,547 --> 01:55:56,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was thinking of the last story.

1647
01:55:58,354 --> 01:56:05,100
[SPEAKER_13]: And for example, if you send a Medal of Honor, you'll get a 23-pound gift card credited to your account.

1648
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:06,301
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a heavy gift card.

1649
01:56:08,222 --> 01:56:10,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what you... How's British Money Joke?

1650
01:56:10,404 --> 01:56:10,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

1651
01:56:11,345 --> 01:56:12,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, then I'll change it.

1652
01:56:13,186 --> 01:56:15,548
[SPEAKER_13]: For Just Dance 2, you get 15 quid.

1653
01:56:15,909 --> 01:56:16,389
[SPEAKER_13]: How's that?

1654
01:56:17,290 --> 01:56:19,391
[SPEAKER_13]: For Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, 28 quid.

1655
01:56:20,612 --> 01:56:22,314
[SPEAKER_13]: So now you can't make a joke about that.

1656
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:25,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we could.

1657
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:26,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably just wouldn't be funny.

1658
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,901
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think it's like up to three.

1659
01:56:28,341 --> 01:56:31,662
[SPEAKER_13]: And if your game's broken, they're going to send it back.

1660
01:56:33,022 --> 01:56:38,103
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll basically just send you a confirmation to say you can have the money or you can't.

1661
01:56:38,843 --> 01:56:40,664
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they'll send it back in two weeks.

1662
01:56:42,564 --> 01:56:44,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Really faulty stuff may be just thrown away.

1663
01:56:44,684 --> 01:56:46,825
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess maybe it's a free way of getting rid of shit.

1664
01:56:47,605 --> 01:56:48,665
[SPEAKER_13]: You might get stuff back.

1665
01:56:48,745 --> 01:56:51,646
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's supposed to be, again, three a month.

1666
01:56:53,666 --> 01:57:00,652
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an ad on that page you're reading from that says insert coin and I can't help but think that's what the girl was trying to do in the picture.

1667
01:57:01,512 --> 01:57:04,655
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking at the one that said in Soviet Russia games make you stronger.

1668
01:57:05,661 --> 01:57:27,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get off of boobs and apparently neither can our chat room there's jokes about the res trans vibrator the ps3 controller that vibrates Tiger Claw saying that stylus is not a suppository put that down all these gems coming from chat.org that's not where you put a suppository suppositories go in your ass not your cooch some girls like to play with both

1669
01:57:29,158 --> 01:57:30,338
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever heard of the shocker?

1670
01:57:30,898 --> 01:57:35,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but I was saying... It's not a suppository.

1671
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,660
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a math lesson for DarkSakura.

1672
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Two plus one is fun.

1673
01:57:43,682 --> 01:57:46,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Professor Layton in the case of the cantankerous clitoris.

1674
01:57:49,483 --> 01:57:54,964
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I'd taken a picture of the gesture that Rob made when he made his little addition thing.

1675
01:57:55,325 --> 01:57:56,765
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not on my algebra final!

1676
01:57:58,502 --> 01:58:02,145
[SPEAKER_02]: SolarFlare in our chatroom says, I thought Nintendo already knew about their products and porn.

1677
01:58:02,165 --> 01:58:03,887
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell the rubbers for their Wiimotes.

1678
01:58:04,327 --> 01:58:05,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Wii condom joke.

1679
01:58:05,508 --> 01:58:05,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

1680
01:58:06,729 --> 01:58:07,890
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what OLR needs?

1681
01:58:08,731 --> 01:58:13,875
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a contest that's like best slash fiction involving Nintendo characters.

1682
01:58:14,576 --> 01:58:16,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And it should just be as absurd as possible.

1683
01:58:18,199 --> 01:58:19,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's some good Mario games?

1684
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:22,302
[SPEAKER_13]: I've read absurd fan fiction.

1685
01:58:22,662 --> 01:58:22,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1686
01:58:26,528 --> 01:58:28,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Pantanos, it's the Super Mario Brothers Super Show!

1687
01:58:49,946 --> 01:58:50,686
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it rated?

1688
01:58:51,427 --> 01:58:53,708
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's M or A, then automatically we'll know it's something good.

1689
01:58:53,768 --> 01:58:59,530
[SPEAKER_06]: It's M. Okay.

1690
01:58:59,610 --> 01:59:01,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so Mario's rescuing the princess.

1691
01:59:04,652 --> 01:59:05,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mario.

1692
01:59:05,593 --> 01:59:06,613
[SPEAKER_02]: The kingdom is saved.

1693
01:59:06,813 --> 01:59:08,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you will get a nice reward.

1694
01:59:08,294 --> 01:59:08,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

1695
01:59:09,074 --> 01:59:09,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

1696
01:59:23,041 --> 01:59:24,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank God this is a radio show.

1697
01:59:26,882 --> 01:59:28,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, the princess bent over.

1698
01:59:31,744 --> 01:59:35,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Bowser going to just get Mario from behind while he's on?

1699
01:59:35,606 --> 01:59:36,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1700
01:59:37,627 --> 01:59:38,267
[SPEAKER_09]: One day later.

1701
01:59:38,287 --> 01:59:40,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Shotgun wedding.

1702
01:59:40,128 --> 01:59:40,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Nine months later.

1703
01:59:48,119 --> 01:59:48,859
[SPEAKER_06]: She's in labor.

1704
01:59:49,259 --> 01:59:51,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are labor pains you're hitting right now.

1705
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:53,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's baby Luigi.

1706
01:59:56,201 --> 01:59:56,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

1707
02:00:03,202 --> 02:00:06,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And now baby Yoshi's coming out and baby Toad.

1708
02:00:06,963 --> 02:00:08,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Party 12.

1709
02:00:08,803 --> 02:00:10,204
Each pulls a train.

1710
02:00:21,690 --> 02:00:26,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny is that video's probably like six years old and we're just now playing this like it's something brand spanking new.

1711
02:00:26,972 --> 02:00:30,473
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the link in chat so you guys can giggle with us.

1712
02:00:30,693 --> 02:00:38,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 13-year-old that made that six years ago now has some web shockwave HTML5 job, you know, making tons of money.

1713
02:00:39,115 --> 02:00:41,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Got his start in high school making Mario porn.

1714
02:00:43,076 --> 02:00:45,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did Nintendo send a cease and desist to that?

1715
02:00:45,217 --> 02:00:46,077
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my question.

1716
02:00:48,018 --> 02:00:48,839
[SPEAKER_02]: That's tasteful.

1717
02:00:49,839 --> 02:00:52,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they're calling up legal and they're like, they hang up the phone.

1718
02:00:52,942 --> 02:00:53,902
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, this is hot.

1719
02:00:54,703 --> 02:00:55,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to wait.

1720
02:00:55,544 --> 02:00:56,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to see how this ends.

1721
02:00:58,326 --> 02:00:59,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Labor is not hot.

1722
02:01:01,588 --> 02:01:03,790
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's very disgusting.

1723
02:01:05,751 --> 02:01:10,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma says, Mario, you are not the father.

1724
02:01:12,557 --> 02:01:13,738
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on, please.

1725
02:01:13,978 --> 02:01:14,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick.

1726
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:16,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, we need a news story, quick.

1727
02:01:17,222 --> 02:01:18,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that doesn't involve boobs.

1728
02:01:19,223 --> 02:01:20,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mario labor.

1729
02:01:20,985 --> 02:01:21,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1730
02:01:23,908 --> 02:01:30,795
[SPEAKER_16]: So, apparently, there's this comment going around from EA Games President Frank...

1731
02:01:31,555 --> 02:01:32,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Gabbo.

1732
02:01:33,016 --> 02:01:38,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Heath believes that the future of the game industry will come from multiplayer games.

1733
02:01:38,978 --> 02:01:51,624
[SPEAKER_16]: It says that EA is very comfortable moving the discussion towards how we make connected gameplay, be it cooperative or multiplayer or online services as opposed to fire and forget package goods only.

1734
02:01:52,084 --> 02:01:54,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Single player, 25 hours and you're out.

1735
02:01:55,146 --> 02:01:58,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Heath says, I think the model is finished.

1736
02:01:58,667 --> 02:01:59,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, finish for them.

1737
02:01:59,728 --> 02:02:16,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, to translate this in layman's speak, he believes that games should have more of an online component, which they charge money for, and also more download content later on so that it extends the gameplay beyond 25 hours, which they charge money for.

1738
02:02:17,482 --> 02:02:24,025
[SPEAKER_16]: and, you know, possibly some sort of massive multiplayer online service, which they would also charge more money for.

1739
02:02:24,105 --> 02:02:26,146
[SPEAKER_16]: So, basically, who wants to charge more money for stuff?

1740
02:02:27,327 --> 02:02:32,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I hate to say it, but isn't there kind of maybe a hint of truth to this?

1741
02:02:32,409 --> 02:02:34,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, because, you know, I think about, okay, well...

1742
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:36,132
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

1743
02:02:50,528 --> 02:02:52,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there download content that ever came out on PlayStation 3 for it?

1744
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:53,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was rumored.

1745
02:02:54,210 --> 02:03:01,916
[SPEAKER_02]: But besides that, the trophies and the achievements kind of add to this more cohesive multiplayer experience on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

1746
02:03:02,317 --> 02:03:13,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, not every gamer is connected on their system, and some people are quite content playing the games by themselves, but even people that don't know how to get their...

1747
02:03:15,166 --> 02:03:19,690
[SPEAKER_02]: X-Boxes online and stuff have probably at least played Bejeweled Blitz once in their life, right?

1748
02:03:20,051 --> 02:03:20,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1749
02:03:22,273 --> 02:03:23,794
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think that... No, I've never played it.

1750
02:03:23,914 --> 02:03:30,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, this is kind of an excuse to say, oh, well, we don't need to worry too much about the single-player experience because people are just going to play the multiplayer experience.

1751
02:03:32,101 --> 02:03:34,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And you haven't played Bejeweled Blitz, but you played Knights of the Clicky.

1752
02:03:34,844 --> 02:03:35,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even worse.

1753
02:03:35,845 --> 02:03:36,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1754
02:03:36,125 --> 02:03:36,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1755
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:44,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, I know I'm a little early, but F you to Knights of the Clicky, because it just deleted, like, three of my friends the other day.

1756
02:03:44,253 --> 02:03:44,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, oh.

1757
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:45,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1758
02:03:45,953 --> 02:03:48,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, two of them are friends of mine I talk to every day.

1759
02:03:48,875 --> 02:03:50,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you have to send a re-invite or something?

1760
02:03:51,035 --> 02:03:51,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't try that yet.

1761
02:03:52,056 --> 02:03:53,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping it would fix itself.

1762
02:03:53,496 --> 02:03:57,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if they, do you know if they removed the game, like, deleted the game from their own profile?

1763
02:03:57,778 --> 02:03:58,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they've had enough.

1764
02:03:58,939 --> 02:03:59,859
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting intervention.

1765
02:03:59,939 --> 02:04:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe.

1766
02:04:00,419 --> 02:04:00,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1767
02:04:00,999 --> 02:04:03,821
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was X-Link, so, X-Link, did you delete the game?

1768
02:04:03,881 --> 02:04:04,281
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you do?

1769
02:04:04,821 --> 02:04:05,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1770
02:04:05,201 --> 02:04:06,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's still on mine, so that shouldn't happen.

1771
02:04:06,843 --> 02:04:07,203
[SPEAKER_02]: No, see?

1772
02:04:08,204 --> 02:04:10,026
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably just deleted me from his friends list.

1773
02:04:10,146 --> 02:04:13,689
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I'm sick of all these vlogs and keyboard cat videos.

1774
02:04:13,709 --> 02:04:14,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just deleting Rob from my friends list.

1775
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:16,031
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably what really happened.

1776
02:04:19,194 --> 02:04:21,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, now we'll get a phone call later for sure.

1777
02:04:21,356 --> 02:04:22,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Rob, we still love you.

1778
02:04:22,617 --> 02:04:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you better.

1779
02:04:24,859 --> 02:04:28,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another, speaking of multiplayer, places where multiplayer things are happening.

1780
02:04:28,841 --> 02:04:30,582
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is the future, Loki.

1781
02:04:30,622 --> 02:04:31,803
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation Home.

1782
02:04:32,284 --> 02:04:35,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, surely, this is what the guy from EA was talking about, right?

1783
02:04:35,065 --> 02:04:37,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It was PlayStation Home was where the multiplayer is at.

1784
02:04:37,907 --> 02:04:40,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you believe PlayStation Home has been out for two years?

1785
02:04:40,709 --> 02:04:44,851
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, a Sony press release came out this week celebrating the second birthday of PlayStation Home.

1786
02:04:45,272 --> 02:04:48,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Over 17 million users have visited home.

1787
02:04:49,054 --> 02:04:51,296
[SPEAKER_06]: For two minutes, and then they left.

1788
02:04:51,316 --> 02:04:51,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1789
02:04:51,656 --> 02:04:51,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1790
02:04:52,156 --> 02:04:55,199
[SPEAKER_02]: They have participated in over 600 community events.

1791
02:04:55,539 --> 02:05:01,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means obviously is collectively those 17 million users played 600 community events.

1792
02:05:03,426 --> 02:05:03,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1793
02:05:04,527 --> 02:05:07,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were sponsored by game developers and so on.

1794
02:05:07,069 --> 02:05:08,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were more unofficial.

1795
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:10,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Sodium 2 is coming out next spring.

1796
02:05:12,473 --> 02:05:18,777
[SPEAKER_02]: and Conspiracy, a multiplayer spy puzzle game from Jet Set Games is coming out as well.

1797
02:05:19,537 --> 02:05:26,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know when the furry sex lounge is coming out because that's... Let's just call it what it is.

1798
02:05:26,462 --> 02:05:28,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, why are we wasting our time?

1799
02:05:28,303 --> 02:05:28,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

1800
02:05:29,604 --> 02:05:31,224
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I tried to do the DDR thing.

1801
02:05:31,245 --> 02:05:31,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't do it.

1802
02:05:34,226 --> 02:05:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Home is the future.

1803
02:05:36,357 --> 02:05:39,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's time for some of you to visit our home.

1804
02:05:39,659 --> 02:05:40,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Not literally.

1805
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:42,580
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to send us emails and interact with us.

1806
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:46,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place for you to send us emails.

1807
02:05:46,802 --> 02:05:49,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura dives into the email bag every week and reads some emails.

1808
02:05:49,743 --> 02:05:54,125
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great way to interact with us if you don't listen or can't listen live every Sunday night.

1809
02:05:54,445 --> 02:05:55,486
[SPEAKER_02]: We always love emails.

1810
02:05:55,586 --> 02:06:04,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com This was the email that was referred to earlier.

1811
02:06:05,951 --> 02:06:07,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey Sky and DarkSakura, sorry Loki.

1812
02:06:08,574 --> 02:06:14,200
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you're able to purchase the WoW games at the moment at the awesome sale prices yet.

1813
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:15,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see any sale prices by the way.

1814
02:06:16,002 --> 02:06:16,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's done.

1815
02:06:17,464 --> 02:06:18,125
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be back.

1816
02:06:18,525 --> 02:06:19,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be back.

1817
02:06:19,451 --> 02:06:47,732
[SPEAKER_13]: but here is an alternative it sounds like Jamie had a WoW account in the past so if Rob sends her a scroll of resurrection via Blizzard's website then he gets a free month when a month of paid game time is applied to Jamie's account including a 10 day non-restricted free trial Rob can simply buy Jamie a month of a game as a present no games or expansions will have to be purchased and play for 40 days and try out the new old world content just an idea from Horde House's podcast number one fan Flaco Jones

1818
02:06:49,218 --> 02:06:50,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Flacco Jones, but that's okay.

1819
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:52,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's a great idea.

1820
02:06:52,543 --> 02:06:55,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe I didn't even think of the Scroll of Resurrection, but that's a great idea.

1821
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:57,712
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing is, when was the last time it played?

1822
02:06:59,324 --> 02:07:04,566
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was more than two months ago, I think you're eligible Okay Which, you're more than six months out, aren't you?

1823
02:07:04,646 --> 02:07:09,449
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I think I'm actually a year out because I got Star Trek Online Didn't I get it last Christmas?

1824
02:07:09,729 --> 02:07:22,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know No, I didn't, I got it So, yeah, I think Star Trek Online came out in like February I think the beta test was going on last Christmas Yeah, so I've been playing Star Trek Online since it was in beta That was, Star Trek Online was in beta around the time you and I started dating, right?

1825
02:07:23,635 --> 02:07:25,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I think it was last Christmas, so

1826
02:07:26,351 --> 02:07:30,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really give a shit about Worgen I'm gonna play a goat chick again

1827
02:07:55,666 --> 02:07:56,547
[SPEAKER_02]: The Draenei are awesome, actually.

1828
02:07:56,567 --> 02:07:57,468
[SPEAKER_13]: The Draenei were cool.

1829
02:07:57,508 --> 02:07:58,128
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really cool.

1830
02:07:58,548 --> 02:08:01,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they are probably the most underrated class in WoW, next to Dwarves.

1831
02:08:01,931 --> 02:08:02,732
[SPEAKER_13]: It was my favorite.

1832
02:08:02,892 --> 02:08:03,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1833
02:08:03,493 --> 02:08:06,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Except that, you know, my whole problem, okay, here's what the problem I ran into was.

1834
02:08:07,176 --> 02:08:10,599
[SPEAKER_13]: When I hit level 20, I was like, what the fuck do I do now?

1835
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:16,444
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm on, I'm off the island, I'm on this place on a boat, I'm on a boat!

1836
02:08:17,044 --> 02:08:19,827
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, I think I remember actually standing out and shouting, I'm on a boat.

1837
02:08:20,627 --> 02:08:21,728
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know what to do now.

1838
02:08:21,769 --> 02:08:22,810
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know where anyone is.

1839
02:08:22,830 --> 02:08:24,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what anyone's doing.

1840
02:08:25,693 --> 02:08:34,402
[SPEAKER_02]: The only issue you would have is that the Draenei and the Blood Elf starting areas were the only areas that weren't changed with this new expansion.

1841
02:08:34,743 --> 02:08:36,785
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still on the same quests and everything.

1842
02:08:37,406 --> 02:08:39,408
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have a level 20 Draenei already.

1843
02:08:39,688 --> 02:08:40,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess that's true.

1844
02:08:40,709 --> 02:08:41,170
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

1845
02:09:01,505 --> 02:09:02,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of dig that.

1846
02:09:02,406 --> 02:09:07,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's one of the things that I really, really like about Star Trek Online is that, first of all, I can play.

1847
02:09:09,112 --> 02:09:13,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Except for playing a few things with some of my fleet friends, I've done all of my leveling myself.

1848
02:09:15,057 --> 02:09:16,878
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done all my missions myself.

1849
02:09:17,739 --> 02:09:26,304
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the missions because it's like, okay, well, you do this, oh no, this leads to this thing, and it's all in the same area.

1850
02:09:27,145 --> 02:09:31,488
[SPEAKER_13]: My favorite mission that I've done to date is the one that I said was Silent Hill.

1851
02:09:32,228 --> 02:09:43,456
[SPEAKER_13]: were, it's the stupid, most stupid next generation bad guys was the Davidians, the ones that were the psychic leeches that were just slightly out of phase with reality.

1852
02:09:44,196 --> 02:09:45,297
[SPEAKER_13]: These blue glowing creatures.

1853
02:09:45,957 --> 02:09:51,401
[SPEAKER_13]: And they figured a way back in, you have to go in the past, you have to go in the present, but they've screwed up the electronics in this old

1854
02:09:52,081 --> 02:09:52,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1855
02:10:03,005 --> 02:10:08,327
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my favorite, but you get to this one point, and then you hear the voice, and another thing happens.

1856
02:10:08,907 --> 02:10:14,709
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I like this, something that builds and builds and builds on top of each other, which is what I wasn't really getting out of World of Warcraft before.

1857
02:10:14,909 --> 02:10:15,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's settled.

1858
02:10:15,889 --> 02:10:24,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get DarkSakura a 60-day WoW card as a Christmaka gift, and then it's a win-win situation because I won't have to hear as much Star Trek nerd chat on this show.

1859
02:10:25,813 --> 02:10:26,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearts.

1860
02:10:27,173 --> 02:10:30,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I was using it as a basis of comparison.

1861
02:10:30,336 --> 02:10:33,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I give you shit because that's what I've been doing for the past nine years.

1862
02:10:33,618 --> 02:10:33,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1863
02:10:34,258 --> 02:10:36,900
[SPEAKER_13]: But my point is that that's the type of missions I like.

1864
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:40,182
[SPEAKER_13]: And if there's stuff like that now in World of Warcraft, because honestly, there really wasn't.

1865
02:10:41,103 --> 02:10:44,986
[SPEAKER_13]: There was... It was like, okay, you take this... Kill deer and skin their corpses.

1866
02:10:45,928 --> 02:10:47,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was really it.

1867
02:10:47,629 --> 02:10:51,092
[SPEAKER_06]: But only one in every six deer has a skin, apparently.

1868
02:10:51,512 --> 02:10:51,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1869
02:10:52,533 --> 02:10:53,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Which they fixed that.

1870
02:10:54,454 --> 02:11:00,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas, if I have a scanning mission, it's beam to the planet, scan five of these items.

1871
02:11:00,518 --> 02:11:01,079
[SPEAKER_13]: You're done.

1872
02:11:01,519 --> 02:11:04,541
[SPEAKER_13]: And you run up to the items and you just scan them.

1873
02:11:05,462 --> 02:11:06,002
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's it.

1874
02:11:06,803 --> 02:11:08,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And I call those my free XP ones.

1875
02:11:09,364 --> 02:11:10,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, look at the pretty textures.

1876
02:11:11,106 --> 02:11:11,606
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, things.

1877
02:11:11,926 --> 02:11:14,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Ramma is starting the You Sold Out chants.

1878
02:11:14,748 --> 02:11:17,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Tigerclaw says it's an excuse to get DarkSakura on Horde House.

1879
02:11:18,571 --> 02:11:23,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And Deathwishing says, crack, Rob's buying Sakura a crack to get a free hit of crack.

1880
02:11:25,343 --> 02:11:33,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, keep in mind, there's no guarantee I'll stick with it again because I am on Star Trek Online.

1881
02:11:33,831 --> 02:11:34,671
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in a fleet.

1882
02:11:34,771 --> 02:11:36,172
[SPEAKER_13]: I play with Scottish men.

1883
02:11:37,053 --> 02:11:38,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I love playing with my Scottish dudes.

1884
02:11:38,514 --> 02:11:41,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but if you come to WoW, you can be in a guild full of gay men.

1885
02:11:42,578 --> 02:11:43,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that is fantastic.

1886
02:11:44,079 --> 02:11:44,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1887
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:46,601
[SPEAKER_13]: What wins, Scottish or gay?

1888
02:11:47,242 --> 02:11:49,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, if I had Scottish gay, I would... Ewan McGregor.

1889
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:52,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's not gay, but he's there to dream.

1890
02:11:52,686 --> 02:11:53,267
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be hot.

1891
02:11:55,682 --> 02:11:57,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I went to my status screen.

1892
02:11:58,023 --> 02:12:03,224
[SPEAKER_13]: My internal status screen now is going blink, blink, blink, blink because I just imagined Scottish and gay.

1893
02:12:03,264 --> 02:12:05,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any gay Scots that listen to the show?

1894
02:12:05,384 --> 02:12:06,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Please email us immediately.

1895
02:12:06,704 --> 02:12:08,245
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura wants to be your friend.

1896
02:12:08,645 --> 02:12:09,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Send me voicemail.

1897
02:12:10,545 --> 02:12:12,405
[SPEAKER_13]: My number is 555-4444.

1898
02:12:12,905 --> 02:12:14,546
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1899
02:12:14,606 --> 02:12:15,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1900
02:12:18,727 --> 02:12:19,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, Scottish and gay.

1901
02:12:19,847 --> 02:12:20,567
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just hot.

1902
02:12:20,707 --> 02:12:20,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

1903
02:12:23,386 --> 02:12:39,746
[SPEAKER_13]: um oh uh thought I'd bring to your attention an interesting BBC commentary airing the UK this evening while you won't be able to see it on iPlayer in the US I'm certain you'll be able to acquire it after airing courtesy of the torrential deluge of data sharing I see what you did there

1904
02:12:41,226 --> 02:13:05,118
[SPEAKER_13]: I love it the link will direct you to an interview conducted by Eurogamer with the director of the show following an exclusive preview screening I'm going to pull up the article in a second it might be worth bringing the issues raised to a wider global audience although I'm sure like me your stance on this and the implications such issues placed on personal responsibility will remain unchanged keep up the good work, Nigel let me see what the article is

1905
02:13:08,204 --> 02:13:12,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Every time I see the name Nigel, that XTC song goes into my head.

1906
02:13:12,999 --> 02:13:13,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Making plans for Nigel.

1907
02:13:15,792 --> 02:13:16,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't follow.

1908
02:13:16,613 --> 02:13:17,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't you listen to XTC?

1909
02:13:17,974 --> 02:13:21,337
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1910
02:13:22,398 --> 02:13:22,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

1911
02:13:23,018 --> 02:13:27,402
[SPEAKER_13]: The article says... Oh, it's about video games being addictive.

1912
02:13:29,663 --> 02:13:31,205
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to quote this a little bit.

1913
02:13:31,565 --> 02:13:41,113
[SPEAKER_13]: We spoke to director and producer Emike Onono about why Panorama chose to highlight the issue and thinks the industry should be less defensive about it.

1914
02:13:42,874 --> 02:13:43,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1915
02:13:43,814 --> 02:13:48,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Leo22 played World of Warcraft for 12 hours per day for two years and calls it a disease.

1916
02:13:51,358 --> 02:13:52,319
[SPEAKER_13]: That was your problem, dude.

1917
02:13:52,779 --> 02:13:53,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

1918
02:13:54,220 --> 02:13:54,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Another email.

1919
02:13:55,581 --> 02:13:56,421
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, thank you, Nigel.

1920
02:13:57,402 --> 02:13:58,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Give us a call sometime.

1921
02:13:58,823 --> 02:13:59,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Leave us a voicemail.

1922
02:14:00,524 --> 02:14:02,024
[SPEAKER_13]: What is going on with Shenmue 3?

1923
02:14:02,164 --> 02:14:03,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there actually one coming out?

1924
02:14:03,385 --> 02:14:03,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1925
02:14:04,146 --> 02:14:06,307
[SPEAKER_13]: And this comes from Jesus.

1926
02:14:07,768 --> 02:14:10,209
[SPEAKER_13]: J-E-Z-U-S How do you know it's not Jesus?

1927
02:14:10,928 --> 02:14:11,909
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1928
02:14:30,188 --> 02:14:31,590
[SPEAKER_13]: What is going on with Shenmue 3?

1929
02:14:31,630 --> 02:14:32,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there one actually coming out?

1930
02:14:32,812 --> 02:14:33,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1931
02:14:33,172 --> 02:14:34,954
[SPEAKER_02]: On mobile phones in Japan.

1932
02:14:35,015 --> 02:14:36,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's like a Shenmue 3.

1933
02:14:36,376 --> 02:14:38,980
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, it's just a fanboy dream.

1934
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:39,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep on dreaming.

1935
02:14:39,981 --> 02:14:40,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep hope alive.

1936
02:14:41,403 --> 02:14:42,805
[SPEAKER_13]: And he emailed twice.

1937
02:14:43,105 --> 02:14:43,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing official.

1938
02:14:44,027 --> 02:14:45,248
[SPEAKER_02]: No more Jesus.

1939
02:14:45,449 --> 02:14:46,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Jesus.

1940
02:14:48,223 --> 02:14:48,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Jewish.

1941
02:14:48,963 --> 02:14:49,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Click.

1942
02:14:49,504 --> 02:14:53,445
[SPEAKER_06]: If Jesus can't use his divine will to put it out, then it's never happening.

1943
02:14:53,465 --> 02:14:55,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not divine.

1944
02:14:55,566 --> 02:15:01,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus should be able to take some extra copies of Final Fantasy XIV and turn them into Shenmue 3, right?

1945
02:15:02,392 --> 02:15:03,793
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna get so much hate mail this week.

1946
02:15:03,813 --> 02:15:05,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like the water and the wine sort of?

1947
02:15:06,174 --> 02:15:07,434
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in good fun.

1948
02:15:07,514 --> 02:15:10,616
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't laugh it yourself, what can you laugh?

1949
02:15:10,636 --> 02:15:11,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the tree trunk out of your ass.

1950
02:15:11,777 --> 02:15:12,477
[SPEAKER_02]: No, come on.

1951
02:15:12,537 --> 02:15:12,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun.

1952
02:15:13,657 --> 02:15:14,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Just teasing.

1953
02:15:15,098 --> 02:15:16,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Just have a little fun.

1954
02:15:16,099 --> 02:15:17,659
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna get some wow.

1955
02:15:17,980 --> 02:15:21,201
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna get some... I feel rub.

1956
02:15:21,681 --> 02:15:22,442
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel funny.

1957
02:15:23,382 --> 02:15:23,982
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel dirty.

1958
02:15:24,683 --> 02:15:26,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll burn for a couple days, but then it goes away.

1959
02:15:26,924 --> 02:15:27,764
[SPEAKER_13]: My arm is itching.

1960
02:15:27,984 --> 02:15:29,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the FUs of the week.

1961
02:15:46,098 --> 02:16:10,273
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a bunch of FUs leading up into something, but the only thing that I'm actually remotely bitter about, and it's more of a, wow, how could you think this, and it's completely shallow, so pardon me for being completely shallow, but, and again, I don't want to say FU this, because it's one of my friends, and I thought it was a really sweet gesture, but I don't wear a 3XL.

1962
02:16:13,422 --> 02:16:13,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-ohs.

1963
02:16:14,903 --> 02:16:17,704
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like girl drama right there.

1964
02:16:18,044 --> 02:16:21,906
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like asking a girl if she's pregnant.

1965
02:16:22,547 --> 02:16:23,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.

1966
02:16:23,207 --> 02:16:24,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even wear an XL.

1967
02:16:25,968 --> 02:16:28,169
[SPEAKER_13]: My t-shirt size is large.

1968
02:16:29,150 --> 02:16:33,412
[SPEAKER_13]: The only XL I wear is if I buy boys t-shirts because I have the rack of days.

1969
02:16:35,842 --> 02:16:41,567
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, and the other thing, too, okay, this is kind of a long, drawn-out story, and I'm not going to go into it, and I completely misunderstood what my friend said.

1970
02:16:41,588 --> 02:16:48,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, one of my friends on Facebook was feeling angry because someone verbally belittled her for what she was wearing to an event.

1971
02:16:49,695 --> 02:16:51,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And she said she was thinking, well, at least I have children and you don't.

1972
02:16:53,218 --> 02:17:01,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I thought it was, because, you know, I've been trying, I thought it was, okay, is that all the value a woman has?

1973
02:17:01,530 --> 02:17:03,392
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell kind of response is that to?

1974
02:17:03,773 --> 02:17:05,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I have children and you don't.

1975
02:17:05,415 --> 02:17:10,181
[SPEAKER_13]: She went back and explained it to me that it's, I have to pay for my children.

1976
02:17:10,261 --> 02:17:12,203
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to pay for any children.

1977
02:17:12,944 --> 02:17:14,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I have expenses that you don't.

1978
02:17:14,646 --> 02:17:16,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I have responsibilities that you don't.

1979
02:17:16,989 --> 02:17:17,750
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what she meant.

1980
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:20,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see it that way because I've been a little bitter.

1981
02:17:23,374 --> 02:17:26,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn you, uterus.

1982
02:17:27,918 --> 02:17:37,046
[SPEAKER_13]: One of her friends started going in three all caps locked posts, by the way, about, I've adopted all these children and I've had the court waive my costs and everything.

1983
02:17:37,186 --> 02:17:41,850
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, dude, what are you doing adopting children if you can't freaking afford them?

1984
02:17:42,330 --> 02:17:49,874
[SPEAKER_13]: That's almost as bad, I mean, I guess you're trying to do something good, but, you know, and my response to her was, I don't care.

1985
02:17:50,554 --> 02:17:51,335
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not my friend.

1986
02:17:52,915 --> 02:17:55,257
[SPEAKER_13]: The person who made the first post, she's my friend.

1987
02:17:55,677 --> 02:17:56,277
[SPEAKER_13]: You are not.

1988
02:17:56,797 --> 02:17:57,698
[SPEAKER_13]: This isn't about you.

1989
02:17:58,058 --> 02:18:00,959
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when I went to check on it an hour later, all of those posts were deleted.

1990
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:02,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook, serious business.

1991
02:18:03,181 --> 02:18:07,723
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm saying, I'm saying, it's just like, that's leading up to this FU.

1992
02:18:08,663 --> 02:18:11,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody needs to know your personal shit.

1993
02:18:12,577 --> 02:18:13,638
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't care.

1994
02:18:13,938 --> 02:18:15,459
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're not our friend, we don't care.

1995
02:18:16,921 --> 02:18:22,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Saying all of this stuff to make yourself be all holier than thou just makes you look bitchier than thou.

1996
02:18:22,806 --> 02:18:23,186
[SPEAKER_13]: The end.

1997
02:18:25,047 --> 02:18:26,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that, bitchier than thou.

1998
02:18:26,469 --> 02:18:27,469
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be my drag name.

1999
02:18:28,010 --> 02:18:28,290
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2000
02:18:29,491 --> 02:18:31,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have any... Oh, where'd the FU music go?

2001
02:18:31,413 --> 02:18:31,853
[SPEAKER_02]: It went away.

2002
02:18:32,113 --> 02:18:33,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have FU music?

2003
02:18:33,915 --> 02:18:35,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Or FUs to go with the music?

2004
02:18:36,139 --> 02:18:37,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, yeah, F.E.

2005
02:18:37,119 --> 02:18:42,944
[SPEAKER_16]: the Comcast for having to put a new drop to our house, which is gonna take ten days.

2006
02:18:43,865 --> 02:18:47,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, it's the line that goes from the cable box out front to my house.

2007
02:18:48,729 --> 02:18:54,214
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the one that's messed up, so I don't have internet for that much longer.

2008
02:18:54,614 --> 02:19:03,859
[SPEAKER_16]: Thankfully, though, I have hacked my phone to be able to Wi-Fi tether to it, so I've had slow internet, but I'd rather have fast internet.

2009
02:19:04,219 --> 02:19:08,122
[SPEAKER_16]: I also bought a DOCSIS 3 modem now, so it should be even faster when I do get it working.

2010
02:19:09,883 --> 02:19:10,203
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

2011
02:19:11,624 --> 02:19:12,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a whole lot actually.

2012
02:19:12,965 --> 02:19:29,235
[SPEAKER_02]: My FUs are pretty, you know, just FU to not having enough money to take any extravagant holiday trips because I'm going to have an entire week off of work this year just due to situations and, you know, just me having extra PTO and them encouraging me to take it basically.

2013
02:19:30,016 --> 02:19:31,917
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might have a whole week off and nowhere to go.

2014
02:19:32,518 --> 02:19:33,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So FU to that fact.

2015
02:19:34,039 --> 02:19:36,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there might be other things going on that will definitely take my time.

2016
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:40,463
[SPEAKER_02]: But FU to getting old and not having trips to take.

2017
02:19:41,724 --> 02:19:43,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop, do you have any FUs?

2018
02:19:44,245 --> 02:19:55,550
[SPEAKER_06]: FUs to buying something digitally and then not having it post to your banking until like seven days later and kind of screwing up the mental math of how much money you thought you had.

2019
02:19:56,130 --> 02:20:01,494
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're on employment on a fixed budget and you expect something that you buy to just show up the next day.

2020
02:20:02,754 --> 02:20:11,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And also F you to just playing a new type of social game and just be nervous about being inexperienced.

2021
02:20:12,307 --> 02:20:12,687
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2022
02:20:13,288 --> 02:20:15,370
[SPEAKER_02]: How about our KDM42?

2023
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:16,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any FUs?

2024
02:20:17,732 --> 02:20:24,058
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to dry air and winter and how it makes my skin get all itchy and crappy and it's always sucky.

2025
02:20:24,679 --> 02:20:28,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And FU to being behind on everything just because of work and all that kind of stuff.

2026
02:20:29,223 --> 02:20:29,643
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2027
02:20:32,586 --> 02:20:33,307
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to the winter.

2028
02:20:34,488 --> 02:20:34,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2029
02:20:35,069 --> 02:20:36,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Winter can be okay sometimes.

2030
02:20:36,690 --> 02:20:39,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the changes my body goes through either.

2031
02:20:41,115 --> 02:20:41,436
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2032
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:44,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki and myself have one more story a piece for you guys.

2033
02:20:44,619 --> 02:20:47,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2034
02:20:48,163 --> 02:20:50,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, a couple quick stories for you guys.

2035
02:20:50,605 --> 02:20:58,068
[SPEAKER_16]: What we were alluding to earlier when we were talking to Bobby and also, I think we may have made this joke during the show.

2036
02:20:59,069 --> 02:21:06,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently, a Cypress Hill backup singer is suing rock star Take-Two over Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

2037
02:21:07,233 --> 02:21:08,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that's right.

2038
02:21:09,476 --> 02:21:22,594
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently, back in the day I guess, Michael Shag Washington, he I guess spoke with the developer and stuff about his troubled youth.

2039
02:21:25,216 --> 02:21:39,144
[SPEAKER_16]: He claims that he met with Rockstar in 2003 to talk to them about his street life for their upcoming game, including a description of his troubled youth and specifics of how the teenagers in his gang rode around on bicycles.

2040
02:21:41,805 --> 02:21:43,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently he's saying...

2041
02:21:44,778 --> 02:21:52,722
[SPEAKER_16]: He didn't even know that he's never seen San Andreas in action until July when his nephew was playing it.

2042
02:21:52,742 --> 02:21:56,304
[SPEAKER_16]: The plaintiff had never seen the game.

2043
02:21:56,364 --> 02:21:58,865
[SPEAKER_16]: He did not own or play video games.

2044
02:21:59,766 --> 02:22:11,692
[SPEAKER_16]: The complaint admits, further explained upon examination of the images of CJ in comparison with his photo from that year and other evidence, it became clear that Rockstar had stolen his image and never paid him.

2045
02:22:12,612 --> 02:22:21,222
[SPEAKER_16]: So now he's claiming he was asking for 25% of the profits from San Andreas, which were approximately $250 million.

2046
02:22:21,562 --> 02:22:25,427
[SPEAKER_16]: So $75 million of that, I guess.

2047
02:22:26,348 --> 02:22:29,251
[SPEAKER_16]: And Take-Two, of course, is saying that the case is completely without merit.

2048
02:22:30,293 --> 02:22:37,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, part of me goes, like, crazy guy is very crazy, and I think we can all agree, this can't be based on his real life.

2049
02:22:37,955 --> 02:22:44,636
[SPEAKER_02]: If this was his real life, having sex with hookers and then shooting him in the face, I mean, he'd be dead from the state.

2050
02:22:44,816 --> 02:22:46,556
[SPEAKER_02]: The state would have executed him years ago.

2051
02:22:46,756 --> 02:22:52,638
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'm sorry, but he wasn't the only person, I'm sure, that was in a gang that rode around on a bicycle.

2052
02:22:52,938 --> 02:22:54,378
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, come on.

2053
02:22:55,500 --> 02:23:00,049
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think, you know, and I like how he says, oh, well, the character looked like me.

2054
02:23:00,598 --> 02:23:04,499
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the character can look like whatever you want because you can customize your character in the game.

2055
02:23:05,339 --> 02:23:15,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the other interesting thing is that, I mean, he claims that he filed the lawsuit and so he must, this meeting he had with Rockstar must not be fake.

2056
02:23:15,663 --> 02:23:17,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that must have actually happened, right?

2057
02:23:17,763 --> 02:23:22,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise it would be really stupid to file a lawsuit and that can easily be disproved that Rockstar never met with him.

2058
02:23:22,605 --> 02:23:28,787
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wonder, like, maybe Rockstar met with a bunch of people and this is just like, it's called doing research.

2059
02:23:29,227 --> 02:23:29,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2060
02:23:30,310 --> 02:23:31,311
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2061
02:23:50,976 --> 02:23:51,276
[SPEAKER_16]: It does.

2062
02:23:51,536 --> 02:23:53,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also, like, too late.

2063
02:23:54,237 --> 02:23:55,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't there, like, a statute of limitations?

2064
02:23:55,818 --> 02:23:56,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess not.

2065
02:23:56,798 --> 02:23:57,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, probably not.

2066
02:23:58,599 --> 02:24:03,421
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, If the game is based on his life, then so is the hot coffee, if you know what I mean.

2067
02:24:03,721 --> 02:24:05,262
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's based on his life at all.

2068
02:24:05,282 --> 02:24:08,003
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it doesn't sound like his meeting was in great detail.

2069
02:24:08,243 --> 02:24:09,244
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fiction.

2070
02:24:09,464 --> 02:24:11,044
[SPEAKER_02]: It was based on no one's life.

2071
02:24:12,125 --> 02:24:12,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when...

2072
02:24:15,794 --> 02:24:24,736
[SPEAKER_02]: A person is going to play a wrestler in a movie so that person hangs out with other wrestlers to kind of know what a wrestler's life is like.

2073
02:24:25,056 --> 02:24:30,437
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean that you model your character directly after somebody, right?

2074
02:24:30,817 --> 02:24:31,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they do this shit?

2075
02:24:31,757 --> 02:24:34,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't actors do this shit all the time in movies, right?

2076
02:24:35,458 --> 02:24:36,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Method acting.

2077
02:24:37,099 --> 02:24:38,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't think it's that much different.

2078
02:24:39,594 --> 02:24:47,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and it has to do with something we reported on previously, an 8-bit remake of DJ Hero that was out there on the internet.

2079
02:24:48,280 --> 02:24:51,683
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been taken down from the official website.

2080
02:24:51,743 --> 02:24:52,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

2081
02:24:52,063 --> 02:24:55,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of a cease and desist letter from Universal Music Publishing Group.

2082
02:24:56,086 --> 02:25:04,853
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a little bit of back and forth going between the creator, Eric Ruth, and the Universal Music Publishing Group, and you can read the whole exchange over at what...

2083
02:25:05,373 --> 02:25:07,315
[SPEAKER_02]: PeakyMall.com, Blog.

2084
02:25:07,615 --> 02:25:09,056
[SPEAKER_02]: It's PeakyGeek, whatever this is.

2085
02:25:09,756 --> 02:25:14,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole little exchange really strikes me as kind of unprofessional.

2086
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:17,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see any signatures in it.

2087
02:25:17,963 --> 02:25:18,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2088
02:25:18,623 --> 02:25:22,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I read this and I go, part of it reads like fanfic to me, but whatever.

2089
02:25:23,667 --> 02:25:25,488
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever reason, the game is now gone.

2090
02:25:25,608 --> 02:25:27,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but you know what they say.

2091
02:25:27,609 --> 02:25:30,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it hits the internet, it's always on the internet.

2092
02:25:30,510 --> 02:25:33,871
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like you can't find this thing on torrent sites and so forth.

2093
02:25:34,211 --> 02:25:41,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, the news about it getting taken down probably just makes more people want to download it because, ha, I have the file I'm not supposed to have.

2094
02:25:41,914 --> 02:25:44,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like why WikiLeaks is such a big deal.

2095
02:25:45,496 --> 02:25:46,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to get on another tangent.

2096
02:25:47,036 --> 02:25:49,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But people just like to have shit they're not supposed to have.

2097
02:25:49,757 --> 02:25:50,438
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

2098
02:25:50,518 --> 02:25:51,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It's EPing.

2099
02:25:52,122 --> 02:26:09,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, another interesting twist in the story, and Dark Tetsuya had mentioned this in our mod forum, and sure enough, it's either a heck of a coincidence, Eric Ruth is the real name of an artist that used to do Bomani-related things named DJ Potato, with an E.

2100
02:26:10,149 --> 02:26:12,510
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't remember if we ever had him on this show.

2101
02:26:12,590 --> 02:26:13,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we did.

2102
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:18,991
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember we banned one of his songs from the old station because it was so, so terrible.

2103
02:26:19,631 --> 02:26:21,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll just have to Google it if you want to find out about that.

2104
02:26:21,772 --> 02:26:24,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of funny that now and then, where are they now?

2105
02:26:25,353 --> 02:26:27,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Barmani people five years later.

2106
02:26:27,093 --> 02:26:28,714
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that's the same Eric Ruth, though.

2107
02:26:28,754 --> 02:26:28,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2108
02:26:29,014 --> 02:26:31,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking it's kind of a common name.

2109
02:26:31,594 --> 02:26:33,375
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I go, well, games.

2110
02:26:33,875 --> 02:26:34,475
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

2111
02:26:36,547 --> 02:26:40,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Did DarkTetsuya have something else to show that or is that just a coinkydink?

2112
02:26:41,910 --> 02:26:44,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need to email DJ Potato and be like, is this you?

2113
02:26:44,211 --> 02:26:45,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this you, brah?

2114
02:26:45,832 --> 02:26:46,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this you?

2115
02:26:47,293 --> 02:26:47,653
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2116
02:26:48,430 --> 02:26:50,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll have to see if there's anything else that comes out on that.

2117
02:26:50,692 --> 02:26:52,573
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, kind of interesting.

2118
02:26:52,854 --> 02:26:54,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are they now, Bomani people?

2119
02:26:54,975 --> 02:27:00,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky are still doing that little podcast they started years ago.

2120
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:02,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had Iguana Girl on here a few weeks ago.

2121
02:27:03,022 --> 02:27:04,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've been talking about episode 400.

2122
02:27:04,203 --> 02:27:07,405
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get a whole lot of the old people together.

2123
02:27:07,425 --> 02:27:08,026
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

2124
02:27:08,286 --> 02:27:09,727
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, that's only seven weeks away.

2125
02:27:10,648 --> 02:27:12,369
[SPEAKER_02]: We might want to start planning that.

2126
02:27:12,389 --> 02:27:13,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2127
02:27:16,744 --> 02:27:17,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's it for the news.

2128
02:27:18,485 --> 02:27:18,906
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done.

2129
02:27:19,306 --> 02:27:20,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the Skype line.

2130
02:27:20,446 --> 02:27:25,469
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2131
02:27:25,649 --> 02:27:26,449
[SPEAKER_02]: All one word.

2132
02:27:26,469 --> 02:27:31,012
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2133
02:27:31,032 --> 02:27:33,093
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skype line is now open for business.

2134
02:27:35,126 --> 02:27:38,971
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkTetsuya says it was in the readme.

2135
02:27:39,192 --> 02:27:42,176
[SPEAKER_02]: It says DJ Potato with an E in the readme file.

2136
02:27:42,977 --> 02:27:44,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is the same guy.

2137
02:27:44,859 --> 02:27:45,861
[SPEAKER_02]: That's proof enough to me.

2138
02:27:47,310 --> 02:27:47,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2139
02:27:49,332 --> 02:27:49,632
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2140
02:27:50,132 --> 02:27:52,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should get him on the show.

2141
02:27:52,154 --> 02:27:52,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2142
02:27:52,674 --> 02:27:57,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I'm worried the topic of old songs will come up and then it'll get really awkward.

2143
02:27:57,858 --> 02:27:58,158
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2144
02:27:59,239 --> 02:28:01,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Solar Flare, we're not doing a marathon for episode 400.

2145
02:28:02,141 --> 02:28:02,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Dream on.

2146
02:28:02,661 --> 02:28:03,722
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2147
02:28:03,742 --> 02:28:04,663
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2148
02:28:04,763 --> 02:28:05,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2149
02:28:05,864 --> 02:28:06,804
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a call coming in right now.

2150
02:28:07,225 --> 02:28:08,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2151
02:28:08,105 --> 02:28:08,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2152
02:28:09,066 --> 02:28:09,846
[SPEAKER_01]: This is X-Link.

2153
02:28:10,087 --> 02:28:10,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, X-Link.

2154
02:28:10,607 --> 02:28:11,207
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2155
02:28:11,227 --> 02:28:11,868
[SPEAKER_01]: You should know me.

2156
02:28:12,248 --> 02:28:14,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your friend from Facebook that didn't defriend you.

2157
02:28:15,322 --> 02:28:21,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently you somehow have left my circle of Knights of the Clicky friends, so I don't know what happened.

2158
02:28:22,060 --> 02:28:30,867
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably because I've been inactive because of a certain other clicky game that we're all too familiar with because we're also all in another guild called WoW.

2159
02:28:31,307 --> 02:28:31,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

2160
02:28:32,288 --> 02:28:36,891
[SPEAKER_01]: So when WoW, when Kata came out, I kind of like totally abandoned all my Facebook games for a while.

2161
02:28:37,351 --> 02:28:43,296
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm pretty sure I have people on my Facebook who haven't played that game but the first time they ever played it.

2162
02:28:43,656 --> 02:28:45,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Like did Marissa ever play past one day?

2163
02:28:45,757 --> 02:28:46,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt she did.

2164
02:28:47,657 --> 02:28:48,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2165
02:29:03,595 --> 02:29:04,736
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, I do.

2166
02:29:04,836 --> 02:29:05,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I seriously do.

2167
02:29:05,497 --> 02:29:19,389
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just there's a lot going on, and I really prefer us getting all the little guild perks and stuff so we can get our 50% or 60% bonuses when we start killing stuff than, you know, playing Knights of the Clique and getting you a broadsword.

2168
02:29:19,849 --> 02:29:24,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so I have to ask, how's Warcraft Cataclysm going for you since it was the big game release this week?

2169
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:28,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going good since you got me addicted to it.

2170
02:29:29,185 --> 02:29:29,646
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fine.

2171
02:29:29,746 --> 02:29:38,299
[SPEAKER_01]: I went out and I always wanted to be in one of those lines during the midnight launching of something, so I decided to go see how it was.

2172
02:29:38,439 --> 02:29:39,441
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very interesting.

2173
02:29:41,578 --> 02:29:49,825
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very intriguing to see all the people QQing and cussing, I can't get in, what the fuck, and what the hell's going on?

2174
02:29:50,606 --> 02:29:59,713
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just funny hearing the people bitch and moan for the first four or five hours of trying to get into the game and they can't get in and trying to become the first of different professions.

2175
02:29:59,893 --> 02:30:01,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It was over in like ten minutes.

2176
02:30:01,955 --> 02:30:06,659
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran Blackrock Caverns before 1am, but we were prepared to go.

2177
02:30:08,157 --> 02:30:08,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

2178
02:30:08,998 --> 02:30:15,061
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a group of like five of us that we had emailed earlier in the day and it was like, okay, we're going to be outside the entrance to the dungeon at 11.59pm.

2179
02:30:15,122 --> 02:30:26,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're the one who, you're the one on your other podcast that went off and saying, talking about how I told you guys that you had to log out and you guys, you didn't really believe me at first.

2180
02:30:26,589 --> 02:30:35,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, there was a blue post that specifically stated if you're in game by the time that thing rolled around that you have to actually log out and then re-log back in.

2181
02:30:36,335 --> 02:30:38,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you flip a magic switch like it's the cable company?

2182
02:30:58,695 --> 02:31:13,330
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah well so anyway yeah but it whatever I mean yeah it was 10 minutes of nerd rage but then it was over and we were doing our quest it was fine but then you guys were doing your dungeons while I'm doing the new profession so

2183
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:14,701
[SPEAKER_02]: How is archaeology?

2184
02:31:14,741 --> 02:31:15,882
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I haven't even touched yet.

2185
02:31:15,922 --> 02:31:20,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Archaeology is loads of fun, but it's very tedious and time-consuming.

2186
02:31:21,427 --> 02:31:24,950
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because you jump from place to place to place, and they're all random.

2187
02:31:25,030 --> 02:31:30,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could go halfway to the bottom of the continent and then have to fly all the way up to the top for another dig site.

2188
02:31:30,875 --> 02:31:38,281
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can take a little bit, but supposedly there's going to be mounts and other items and pets.

2189
02:31:38,361 --> 02:31:39,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, like, two pets so far.

2190
02:31:39,602 --> 02:31:41,084
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get any of the mounts yet.

2191
02:31:42,024 --> 02:31:44,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we'll see what happens.

2192
02:31:44,565 --> 02:31:48,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

2193
02:31:48,367 --> 02:31:48,547
[SPEAKER_01]: X-Link.

2194
02:32:12,426 --> 02:32:15,988
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Dad, I'm one of the few people in your guild that's not gay, but that's okay.

2195
02:32:16,568 --> 02:32:17,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I still love you anyways.

2196
02:32:17,729 --> 02:32:20,271
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still fake a Scottish accent pretty good, right?

2197
02:32:20,931 --> 02:32:21,451
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I cannot.

2198
02:32:22,712 --> 02:32:23,572
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not even going to try?

2199
02:32:24,213 --> 02:32:25,454
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.

2200
02:32:25,994 --> 02:32:27,555
[SPEAKER_02]: You're no fun at all, just so you know.

2201
02:32:28,355 --> 02:32:28,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

2202
02:32:29,556 --> 02:32:33,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't do a Scottish accent, that's all.

2203
02:32:34,058 --> 02:32:40,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand you're not gay and you're very happy with your girlfriend and you're very secure and all that stuff, but you do like musicals, right?

2204
02:32:41,038 --> 02:32:45,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories while we're waiting for the phone to ring?

2205
02:33:06,230 --> 02:33:11,514
[SPEAKER_16]: TurboGrafx-16 emulation is coming to the iPod and iPhone.

2206
02:33:12,175 --> 02:33:17,459
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to be doing something similar to the Commodore 64 client that's out there.

2207
02:33:17,539 --> 02:33:25,867
[SPEAKER_16]: It says you're going to get the actual emulator, which will come with Olympic-style World Sports Competition.

2208
02:33:27,788 --> 02:33:39,975
[SPEAKER_16]: for free, and then each day Hudson will select one game from the library and make it available through the app for a free three-minute trial, and each individual game will be available for $3.99.

2209
02:33:40,015 --> 02:33:41,996
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let me go back to the phone.

2210
02:33:42,036 --> 02:33:43,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2211
02:33:43,076 --> 02:33:43,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2212
02:33:44,637 --> 02:33:45,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Deathwishing.

2213
02:33:45,918 --> 02:33:46,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Deathwishing.

2214
02:33:46,858 --> 02:33:47,819
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind, Deathwishing?

2215
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:52,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides being really tired because I rode 60 miles on my bike.

2216
02:33:53,542 --> 02:33:55,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, why'd you ride 60 miles on your bike?

2217
02:33:56,411 --> 02:33:57,651
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm working out.

2218
02:33:57,771 --> 02:33:59,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have big, huge quads.

2219
02:33:59,992 --> 02:34:00,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

2220
02:34:00,332 --> 02:34:01,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you got to impress the ladies?

2221
02:34:03,433 --> 02:34:04,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, with my massive meaty legs.

2222
02:34:04,894 --> 02:34:05,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure, whatever.

2223
02:34:05,734 --> 02:34:06,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

2224
02:34:06,154 --> 02:34:07,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have beefcake legs.

2225
02:34:07,375 --> 02:34:08,055
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's fine.

2226
02:34:09,115 --> 02:34:11,936
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, good luck with the bike riding.

2227
02:34:12,037 --> 02:34:12,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's on your mind tonight?

2228
02:34:14,057 --> 02:34:16,098
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is up with this grand shrivel?

2229
02:34:16,178 --> 02:34:18,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at my friend's house.

2230
02:34:18,259 --> 02:34:24,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing it, and I realized 200 cars are ungodly beautiful, and you can take pictures of them.

2231
02:34:25,151 --> 02:34:47,650
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's almost like that's all the game is good for is taking pictures of cars and like wanking but I know it's like I'm going through 200 cars list and like wow these are beautiful all of a sudden I get to this one car and it looks like Playstation 1 it's like they made this great game and so the game is like a burger and then the bacon that's supposed to be wrapped around it is like 3 weeks old

2232
02:34:49,344 --> 02:34:50,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting analogy.

2233
02:34:51,105 --> 02:34:59,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think maybe possibly, I know this might be hard to believe, but do you think maybe a game company rushed the game to get it out at a certain time?

2234
02:35:00,007 --> 02:35:12,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know we didn't just have a story on that earlier in the evening, but do you think maybe they rushed this car and just made it out of triangles and basic shapes to get it in there?

2235
02:35:13,251 --> 02:35:16,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they just got fed up with all these, like, oh, we have to push it back.

2236
02:35:16,632 --> 02:35:17,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we gotta push it back.

2237
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:17,912
[SPEAKER_04]: We, uh,

2238
02:35:18,348 --> 02:35:19,929
[SPEAKER_04]: messed up on a tire thing.

2239
02:35:19,989 --> 02:35:23,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Our developer, he's a neat freak and he keeps on trying to make the cars look beautiful.

2240
02:35:23,751 --> 02:35:27,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Then soon they're just like, fuck it, we'll make it so you can drive a go-kart backwards and win a race.

2241
02:35:27,773 --> 02:35:32,896
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what would be awesome is that if Gran Turismo had more of a sense of humor and they put some funny cars in the game.

2242
02:35:33,957 --> 02:35:38,119
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, how about an old covered wagon with oxen could actually be one of the cars.

2243
02:35:38,139 --> 02:35:41,721
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a river that you're trying to Ford to get across.

2244
02:35:42,182 --> 02:35:43,242
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be an awesome car.

2245
02:35:43,362 --> 02:35:46,284
[SPEAKER_04]: How about just one of those little Barbie jeeps?

2246
02:35:46,664 --> 02:35:50,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a Barbie Jeep or a Flintstone car where the guys are running to get it to go.

2247
02:35:50,727 --> 02:35:55,911
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember one of the old Need for Speed games had a bunch of different codes you could put in to race as different things.

2248
02:35:55,971 --> 02:35:59,433
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the things that they had, like a lot of them were background objects.

2249
02:35:59,553 --> 02:36:01,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Like you could race as a log.

2250
02:36:01,314 --> 02:36:03,396
[SPEAKER_16]: You could race as a T-Rex statue.

2251
02:36:04,016 --> 02:36:05,737
[SPEAKER_16]: We used to have log races all the time.

2252
02:36:05,797 --> 02:36:06,898
[SPEAKER_16]: It was awesome.

2253
02:36:07,218 --> 02:36:13,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Or a log with the T-Rex chasing after you and like meter made cars and all sorts of crazy shit.

2254
02:36:13,923 --> 02:36:16,064
[SPEAKER_02]: or we can race as the horse in Daytona.

2255
02:36:16,164 --> 02:36:16,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I have a question.

2256
02:36:16,884 --> 02:36:19,865
[SPEAKER_02]: When you would do the log races, would you actually all sing this song?

2257
02:36:37,085 --> 02:36:38,926
[SPEAKER_02]: How could this song not wake you up?

2258
02:36:39,767 --> 02:36:41,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna put this on my alarm clock.

2259
02:36:41,528 --> 02:36:43,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, here's my favorite part.

2260
02:36:43,370 --> 02:36:43,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

2261
02:36:53,382 --> 02:36:56,104
[SPEAKER_02]: The only good cake song is the You Are A Pirate song.

2262
02:37:23,430 --> 02:37:24,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the You Are A Pirate song.

2263
02:37:25,291 --> 02:37:25,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you do.

2264
02:37:26,052 --> 02:37:29,755
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that was a little... Do what you want because a pirate is free.

2265
02:37:29,815 --> 02:37:31,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Do what you want because a pirate is free.

2266
02:37:31,616 --> 02:37:32,937
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a pirate.

2267
02:37:33,317 --> 02:37:34,959
[SPEAKER_12]: And it had the little dancing part in the middle.

2268
02:37:37,681 --> 02:37:40,483
[SPEAKER_04]: That girl was like a 4chan loli icon, just saying.

2269
02:37:41,112 --> 02:37:45,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the song I should put on my email client now when I get new emails.

2270
02:37:45,995 --> 02:37:50,598
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy's like a D-list celebrity now.

2271
02:37:50,618 --> 02:37:53,780
[SPEAKER_00]: They get pictures of him out and about in LA.

2272
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:56,321
[SPEAKER_06]: He has a fucking shirt at Hot Topic now.

2273
02:38:06,187 --> 02:38:07,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm kind of like a mindfuck right now.

2274
02:38:07,508 --> 02:38:07,588
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

2275
02:38:29,788 --> 02:38:34,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Hide your wife, hide your kids, and hide your husband too, because they're raping everybody on out here.

2276
02:38:34,872 --> 02:38:35,873
[SPEAKER_04]: He's raping everybody.

2277
02:38:37,634 --> 02:38:38,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

2278
02:38:38,194 --> 02:38:42,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, if you're looking up songs like that, look up the Best Cry Ever autotune remix.

2279
02:38:43,178 --> 02:38:45,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one that was on Saturday Night Live?

2280
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:50,183
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's this video of this guy from that show, like Intervention or something, and he cries.

2281
02:38:50,223 --> 02:38:54,967
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, They parodied that on Saturday Night Live, didn't they?

2282
02:38:55,247 --> 02:38:56,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, hold on, hold on.

2283
02:38:56,108 --> 02:38:57,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they did a parody of it.

2284
02:38:59,213 --> 02:39:00,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, what have I done?

2285
02:39:00,614 --> 02:39:27,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know, somewhere deep down in my heart That's what it is I still love you I still love you It's so sad but so funny

2286
02:39:30,293 --> 02:39:34,937
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy seriously has a problem, but it's like, how do you cry like that?

2287
02:39:37,219 --> 02:39:37,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2288
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:38,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2289
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:39,261
[SPEAKER_02]: But hold on, wait, wait.

2290
02:39:39,281 --> 02:39:40,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone needs their own call time.

2291
02:39:40,902 --> 02:39:49,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's fine, but I know this has nothing to do with video games, but I just wanted to say the best clip from Intervention, however, that they made was this.

2292
02:39:50,170 --> 02:39:51,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the autotune, it was this.

2293
02:39:51,391 --> 02:39:52,832
[SPEAKER_00]: This program contains subject...

2294
02:39:59,641 --> 02:40:01,542
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the best clip to ever come from Intervention.

2295
02:40:01,562 --> 02:40:03,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm walking on sunshine.

2296
02:40:20,816 --> 02:40:24,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for bringing the level of the show down tonight.

2366
02:45:08,203 --> 02:45:09,584
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could find it, but I can't.

2367
02:45:10,802 --> 02:45:12,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd wonder what Windows would do with that.

2368
02:45:12,364 --> 02:45:13,365
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd be like, no.

2369
02:45:14,166 --> 02:45:14,306
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2370
02:45:15,867 --> 02:45:16,668
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:45:23,035 --> 02:45:24,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have any other stories for us, Loki?

2373
02:45:25,989 --> 02:45:27,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, just real quick.

2374
02:45:27,891 --> 02:45:36,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Wolfenstein 3D, they've recreated it in LittleBigPlanet 2 using the really incredible creation engine.

2375
02:45:36,818 --> 02:45:38,219
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's just amazing the stuff.

2376
02:45:38,319 --> 02:45:41,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Someone actually built a ray casting engine within LittleBigPlanet 2.

2377
02:45:43,203 --> 02:45:44,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the video of that.

2378
02:45:44,603 --> 02:45:50,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though it kind of looks junky, just the fact that they pulled it off is amazing.

2379
02:45:50,784 --> 02:45:55,145
[SPEAKER_16]: The fact that they pulled off a recasting engine, yeah, it's just nuts.

2380
02:45:55,745 --> 02:45:59,006
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's going to be an awesome game when it comes out.

2381
02:45:59,666 --> 02:46:00,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Only a month away.

2382
02:46:00,446 --> 02:46:01,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, a few weeks.

2383
02:46:02,747 --> 02:46:03,267
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

2384
02:46:03,487 --> 02:46:04,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to play.

2385
02:46:04,307 --> 02:46:04,607
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

2386
02:46:05,447 --> 02:46:05,847
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

2387
02:46:06,367 --> 02:46:07,487
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I want to talk about.

2388
02:46:07,507 --> 02:46:08,648
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's fine.

2389
02:46:09,048 --> 02:46:10,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other last-minute stories from anyone else in the studio?

2390
02:46:11,502 --> 02:46:16,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well then this is the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up for the night.

2391
02:46:16,345 --> 02:46:18,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian42, since you're holding the mic, thank you for being here.

2392
02:46:18,866 --> 02:46:21,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you had fun laughing along with us and reminiscing about some Sega.

2393
02:46:21,608 --> 02:46:23,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2394
02:46:24,530 --> 02:46:25,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Delta Patrol.

2395
02:46:26,171 --> 02:46:28,352
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever find it, it's awesome.

2396
02:46:28,872 --> 02:46:32,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully someone has it on YouTube or find a soundtrack at least if you can.

2397
02:46:32,754 --> 02:46:33,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's on YouTube somewhere.

2398
02:46:34,235 --> 02:46:39,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know something that long, but if you find it, it's a pretty cool soundtrack.

2399
02:46:43,103 --> 02:46:44,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to look right now.

2400
02:46:47,226 --> 02:46:48,287
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I found some chicks.

2401
02:46:48,347 --> 02:46:50,248
[SPEAKER_02]: My Twilight soundtrack redone.

2402
02:46:50,789 --> 02:46:52,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that has to do with Delta Patrol.

2403
02:46:52,570 --> 02:46:52,990
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

2404
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:53,370
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2405
02:46:54,251 --> 02:46:56,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop, thank you as always for being here in the studio.

2406
02:46:56,973 --> 02:46:57,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

2407
02:46:57,633 --> 02:46:59,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2408
02:47:00,836 --> 02:47:02,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone send me employment vibes.

2409
02:47:04,769 --> 02:47:06,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you do that.

2410
02:47:07,272 --> 02:47:07,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2411
02:47:08,734 --> 02:47:09,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2412
02:47:09,134 --> 02:47:09,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go next.

2413
02:47:09,835 --> 02:47:15,322
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is man, I wish pink berries were open this late because I could use some fro-yo.

2414
02:47:16,143 --> 02:47:19,407
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura and her knitting self over there.

2415
02:47:19,427 --> 02:47:20,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm crocheting.

2416
02:47:20,688 --> 02:47:23,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2417
02:47:23,951 --> 02:47:28,794
[SPEAKER_13]: This silk bamboo yarn is really fucking difficult to use and really tiny.

2418
02:47:29,134 --> 02:47:33,217
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wish that my friend had picked out a thicker yarn for me to make her scarf out of.

2419
02:47:33,277 --> 02:47:34,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's silk bamboo.

2420
02:47:34,797 --> 02:47:35,338
[SPEAKER_13]: It is really nice.

2421
02:47:35,378 --> 02:47:36,078
[SPEAKER_13]: It was on sale too.

2422
02:47:36,578 --> 02:47:36,839
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2423
02:47:36,899 --> 02:47:38,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2424
02:47:40,475 --> 02:48:03,242
[SPEAKER_16]: my final thought is I wish my internet was backup I can't even imagine like thank gosh you have a baby to entertain you because like if you didn't have that I don't know what you know thank god I have my phone that I can you know tag onto the Wi-Fi for that and at least browse the internet downloading is out of the picture but browsing the internet is at least tolerable with that

2425
02:48:04,332 --> 02:48:07,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2426
02:48:07,093 --> 02:48:08,434
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be back next week.

2427
02:48:08,514 --> 02:48:14,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if the conversation was on or off air, but there was a thought that we might not be here next week, but we are going to be here next week.

2428
02:48:15,018 --> 02:48:15,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all worked out.

2429
02:48:15,838 --> 02:48:17,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be back next week.

2430
02:48:17,919 --> 02:48:19,800
[SPEAKER_02]: We're creeping closer to the year end.

2431
02:48:19,940 --> 02:48:22,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, next week will be our last show before Christmas.

2432
02:48:22,822 --> 02:48:24,522
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there will be one more show before Christmas.

2433
02:48:25,823 --> 02:48:27,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do math.

2434
02:48:27,744 --> 02:48:33,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Next week is the last show before Christmas, and then I will be out of town after that.

2435
02:48:33,487 --> 02:48:33,867
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

2436
02:48:59,258 --> 02:49:00,319
[SPEAKER_13]: That remains to be seen.

2437
02:49:00,619 --> 02:49:00,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2438
02:49:00,959 --> 02:49:04,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Dan really wants to go to Washington to see the family.

2439
02:49:04,262 --> 02:49:04,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

2440
02:49:05,263 --> 02:49:08,446
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can say no need to go back.
