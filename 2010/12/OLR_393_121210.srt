00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,040
Tonight, December 12, 2010, a high-profile PlayStation 3 game gets a big delay, Australia

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:46,160
debates a new video game rating, and more rumors leak about

3
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,880
chat rooms at chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,840
with my co-host, Dark Sakura. Jamie Summers. Hi. How are you? Productive. Productive. That's

5
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,240
good. Productive Jamie is happy Jamie, right? Sort of. I'm being paid for it, so. Hey, money.

6
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:12,080
Yay, money. Yeah, and I'm going into finals week, so. Good times. Yeah. All right. Well,

7
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:22,280
good luck with all that crap. Say hello. Okay, if 2x plus 9 equals y, I forget it. All right.

8
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,000
I could actually rewrite that five million different ways now. Solve for kitten. The

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,080
answer is shirmy. Can't divide by kitten, unfortunately. Hi, Loki. How are you? Techmaster

10
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,120
Loki joins us here every week with his witty insight. How are you, Loki? Good, and you

11
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,640
divide by kitten. Is that, it's like zero. You can't mix the kitten with anti-kitten.

12
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,200
Not unless kitten is radical. Oh, it's gonna be one of those shows tonight. It's just not

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,320
gonna make any sense at all. Also, say hello. We have some guests. It's like plural in studio

14
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,580
tonight, and I'm gonna introduce them here. Since he has the mic, I will say hello to

15
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,640
Salacious Pop. Hello. Hi, how are you? I'm great, how are you? I am well, thanks for

16
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,520
asking. Except for the fact that, you know, it's Sunday night, and then once this whole,

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,800
this whole shtick is over, it's back to the work week, you know. Yeah, and you have to

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
be at work at like 7, 730 for a while now, up until the holidays. Yeah, and I'm just

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
not a morning person. You know, I really like my job, don't get me wrong, but it's just

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,160
one of those, like, you know, oh, getting used to the new schedule's really messing

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,040
with me. But, you know, it is what it is, so. Rama says if you divide by cat, you get

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,120
a kitten, but technically if you multiply two cat equals kitten, six kitten. I can't

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,560
even understand any of this. Alright, so also say hello in studio. We have another guest

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,360
joining us tonight, RKDN42. How are you, my friend? Oh, I'm doing okay. Long time no see.

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,680
I haven't seen you since, I don't think you've been here since the marathon episode. Yep,

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,320
that's the last time I was in. Which, funny enough, Salacious Pop was here for too. It's

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,440
almost like a marathon show reunion. No marathons, please, no marathons. Who wants to stay up

28
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,920
until 4 AM tonight? Woo! Yay! I don't have a podcast to edit after the show, so I can

29
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,080
do it. Let's go, let's do it. It's like New Year's Rockin' Eve. Alright, anyhow, let's

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,560
see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com. Act Deaf in our chatroom starts us off with

31
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
this classy comment. Salacious Pop, the occasional fourth host of the show, I wonder if he sleeps

32
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,520
with one of the hosts. Actually, I always refer to the chatroom as the ever-present

33
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,520
fourth guest on the show, so I think Act Deaf, you're implying that the entire chatroom is

34
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,160
in fact sleeping with one of the hosts, I think is what he's really trying to say. Slumber

35
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,000
party! Whoever falls asleep first because their underwear thrown in the freezer. Follow

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,280
your dreams and never let anyone tell you that you cannot sleep your way to the paragon

37
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,680
of independent video game journalism. You just, you put on your little black dress,

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,000
and you work it, and you will be where I am now. Believe in your dreams. Yes. I have to

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,440
share something right now, before I forget about it, and before we get to our gaming

40
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,200
weeks. It's not something I need antibiotics for, is it? This gorgeous piece of journalism,

41
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,740
which I will take a picture of and show the chatroom in a moment, is the American River

42
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:21,720
Review 2011 edition. I've done design in this. It's $25. Go buy one! Why would anyone not

43
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,200
in this area want one? Because this thing wins, like, Uber awards. We have people in

44
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Sweden that listen to this show. Why should a Swedish person buy some community college

45
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,240
– oh, recipes! Fantastic literature. It's the best of edition. Fantastic art. Fashion.

46
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,760
I bet all of our, like, gaming guys that listen to this show, you know, in their teens that

47
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,000
are, you know, between games of Call of Duty and Halo Reach are like, oh my god, fashion!

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No, there's also – Where do I buy? Some of the art in here is definitely nerd-influenced.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,500
Is there any video game reviews in there? No, but there's lots of talk of video games

50
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,280
in some of the stories. Okay. So obviously people, some of the writers are definite geeks,

51
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,520
but it is a worthy purchase. I will find the ordering information and post it somewhere

52
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,680
so everyone can see. But I've worked on this one. And also, if you send me the money

53
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,720
to get it for you, I will autograph it and get other people to autograph it and send

54
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,520
it back to you so you can have an autographed copy. I'll autograph it, I guess, even though

55
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,880
I had nothing to do with the publication of that book. I'm talking about the other people

56
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,840
that worked on the magazine. Alright, anyway. Let's get into some actual gaming content.

57
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,400
It does happen occasionally on this program. We talk about video games. And we always started

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,760
off with a little bit of how was your gaming week. So DarkSakura, besides, you know, doing

59
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,800
all that book stuff, how was your gaming week? My gaming week was full of some Star Trek

60
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:57,440
Online because the new Episode III came out. And it's awesome. By awesome, I mean amazing.

61
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:06,440
It's really hard to take a picture of something black. I, uh... What? Never mind. What? No,

62
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,360
that's inappropriate. Just don't take a picture of my penis then, okay? I was just gonna say

63
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,840
that was... I went there, I went there. That was rumored to be a problem with the Kinect

64
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:22,720
at one time. At any rate, I played a lot of Final Fantasy... Final... Fucking Final Fantasy.

65
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,520
I played a lot of Star Trek Online. They have completely redone Sector Space. I was showing

66
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,560
you guys the pictures. Now you can actually turn off that little grid thing. And when

67
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,640
the grid is on, it's actually a lot less pronounced. But then you can just fly around like you're

68
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,120
in space. And you have the little light trails as your ship moves. Which people were complaining

69
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,400
about. Wait, light trails and grid? The grids were gone. And it's not a light cycle. They're

70
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,540
trying to separate themselves from Tron a little bit? No. People were complaining that

71
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,760
when you were in warp, it didn't look like you were in warp. When you hit maximum level,

72
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,520
does the game tell you end of line? No. When you approach systems... It used to be that

73
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,240
it would look like a little glowing model of a system. You know, like you had in science

74
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:14,360
class. Now it's you approach stars. And as you get closer, it actually looks like a sun.

75
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,560
And the planets pop up around it. And it's like you're actually approaching the system.

76
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,680
And only other turkeys will get this. When you go like to the badlands, or to little

77
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,420
nebula or something. When you approach it, it actually looks like a haze off in the distance

78
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,880
and then you're in there. Then when you actually enter the system or the area, then you're

79
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,760
fully... Rob's pulling up the freaking... Well, I was going to say that we have a clip

80
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,840
of the soundtrack for the new Star Trek expansion.

81
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:56,920
As you're flying through space? No? You can't touch a rainbow? It looks like they've retextured

82
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,400
some of the planets. They've retextured the characters. They've updated some stuff. Earth's

83
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Starbase has a basement now. Oooh, fucking basement. I also finally decided to make an

84
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,680
Orion slave girl. Running around in a bikini. It's fantastic. Apparently you can modify

85
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,720
the gourd now like anyone wants to play a giant freaking lizard. Okay, I have to share

86
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,600
this and it has something to do with it. There's my favorite Star Trek episode reviewer on

87
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,040
YouTube. It's SF Debris. He's funny. It's the highly opinionated Star Trek reviews.

88
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:42,600
And he was talking about Cisco... They did one for Trials and Tribulations for DS9. And

89
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,800
talking about Cisco wanting... He could have talked to Kirk about all this other stuff.

90
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,960
Instead he wanted to hear about the one time he porched a giant lizard in the nose. Punched?

91
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,680
I said not porched. I wonder what a porch punch is. This guy's reviews are fantastic.

92
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,440
It was Barry Waddle on purpose. Maybe because Dork von Weenie was already taken. Arne Darvin,

93
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,240
you see, is actually a Klingon. He was surgically ultra-depressed as a spy because when you're

94
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,800
a Klingon... This guy's really funny. Of course he also said that the Defiant should have

95
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,600
been named Ben Sisko's motherfucking pimp slap... pimp hand. Pimp slap hand. That was

96
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,440
it. Ben Sisko's motherfucking left pimp slap hand. Welcome to the Star Trek humor podcast.

97
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,760
Anyway. We have some really funny jokes for you today. So back to that... I have a really

98
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,520
good zinger about Klingons. And stay tuned because... Is this NPR? Where am I? Oh my

99
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:49,600
God. Talk of the nation. Oh my God. If I can finish with my story... But at any rate...

100
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,880
They've made lots of changes for the better. Still pissed off at Dabo. Hololita still annoying.

101
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,200
And that's really about it. They've done a bunch of other retexturing. But really they've

102
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,440
closed stuff off. The one thing I'm looking forward to is trying out the foundry. Which

103
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,360
is... You can create your own missions. And then have other people go in and play them.

104
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,880
You can put them up for other people to download and play. So... The good thing about that

105
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,800
is that while maybe you've gone through all the major missions and everything is... Oh

106
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,360
yay. But you can actually go through and play new content that other people have created.

107
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,680
And that's really neat. On the Tribble server they've got this thing to create new content.

108
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,880
Which I haven't gotten to work yet. But I'm gonna look into that too. The Tribble server

109
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,520
is the playtest server. So you can actually get a look at things that are coming out before

110
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,120
they come out on the official server. Which I think is cool. So it's like they have a

111
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,920
continuous beta going on. Like wow? Except this is a special one where actually the stuff

112
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,400
is broken on purpose. Like wow? And the stuff that's fixed is ready for everybody else to

113
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:10,520
play without being broken. Okay. The last issue that the free expansion that City of

114
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,080
Heroes put out was issue 14. The mission architect creator. Where you could create your own campaign

115
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,380
and that was the last expansion that Cryptic worked on. So it sounds like they're doing

116
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,960
something similar for Star Trek. Yeah. They're really putting a lot of their attention on

117
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,400
Star Trek Online. And what I would like is for maybe a Vice Admiral level 2 or something.

118
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,960
Because right now my main character is Max and she has tons of fun to play. Although

119
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,720
I have found out that Orions kick a lot of ass. If you play a female Orion you get a

120
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,920
power called Seduce. It's called, they just called it, look at my boobs. Just saying you

121
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,320
can get a succubus with a warlock character and she will show people her boobs and use

122
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,880
a move called Seduce. Just saying. Remember my offer still stands if people want to pay

123
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,600
for me to play World of Warcraft I will. Why can't I have an offer like that? I thought

124
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,520
that was going to go in a different direction there. I want people. Alright. Apparently

125
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,200
the chat room likes my NPR voice. So one of these days I'm going to have to just do an

126
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,600
Orange Lounge Radio and all NPR voice. Or you could just go listen to that Techno Kitten

127
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,480
Adventure interview last week. Hello this is Terry Gross. Today we're going to talk

128
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,560
about. Hello you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We have a hilarious interview coming

129
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,760
up with Nick, the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure. He'll be joining us to talk about

130
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,760
his game. And also we'll be talking about USL Madness. It's maddening. Be sure to get

131
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,200
your miss in right away. And also when Rob uses that voice it sounds a lot like the Saturday

132
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,320
Night Live sketch. And then I expect to have Martha Stewart come out and make brownies.

133
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,280
Anyhow. Loki how was your gaming week? Please help. My gaming week consisted of not much

134
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,440
because one I didn't have internet. Which is not really a big factor because I don't

135
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:05,440
play online games at home. At least not anymore. And what else? Basically Grand Theft Auto

136
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:14,760
work. Swords and Poker 2 on the iPod. And I did try out Infinity Blade which is all

137
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,520
sorts of beautiful and actually plays pretty good. So it's very neat what they can do on

138
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:28,880
the iPod. But yeah that's pretty much it. Didn't play a whole lot. Let's go to our guests.

139
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,760
We'll see if our guests have anything exciting to share. How about Salacious Pulp? Only two

140
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,040
games to talk about really. Maybe two and a half. The half is Knights of the Crystals

141
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,440
on Facebook. Knights of the Clicky. Knights of the Clicky. Not really a game. I gotta

142
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,000
use all your action points. You don't have to feed cows in it so already it's good. I

143
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,840
forgot to spend my action points before coming to this show. I'm pissed. Dammit. Oh well.

144
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,280
If you buy the $50 worth of Square Enix points that's the best value. What a waste spending

145
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:10,480
money on that game. Like the items you get. Forget it. Then Poker Night at the Inventory

146
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:18,000
on Steam. I've been slowly unlocking because I've definitely gotten better at the Texas

147
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,940
Hold'em thing as I've been playing. I've been unlocking the various tables and deck cards.

148
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,880
So it does have unlockables in it. No new characters. But I have the Fruit Fucker Card

149
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,620
Table and the Salmon Max. Don't you mean the Fruit Friend? Fruit Friend. Fruit Friend Card

150
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,760
Table and the Salmon Max deck of cards. Is that what they're calling it in there? Fruit

151
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,800
Friend yeah. I just really liked when we were at PAX a few years ago someone cosplayed the

152
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,640
Fruit Fucker. There were like three people cosplayed as the Fruit Fucker. That was great.

153
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,600
They just all looked the same. And then Cataclysm. You know we should play Poker Night at the

154
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,480
Inventory online sometime. Oh wait. It's just fan service. The ride is really funny. Strong

155
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,960
Bad cracks me up the most. I have to poke a little fun at it. Come on. For the longest

156
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,160
time we look like we're totally tell tale biased. So I have to take an opportunity to

157
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,280
poke this one where I can. When the Seg was on a couple weeks ago on the show he was like

158
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,600
it's a very basic fan service game. Don't expect it to be anything other than you know

159
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,600
kind of trying to take us down a couple notches on the hype. That's true. Yeah. And then Cataclysm

160
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,580
of course came out Monday night so I'm in Deepholm right now level. No I'm about to

161
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,240
start Oldham. I'm level 83. Haven't done any of the new level 1 content yet for any of

162
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,440
the races. I'm very much working on my main. And you have a separate WoW podcast for all

163
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,300
of that so that's all I'm gonna say. But it's out. It's there. That's okay. I'm gonna talk

164
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,840
Cataclysm a little bit here. Just cause it's a huge huge thing. So it has to cross over

165
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:02,360
a little bit. Overall I'm very amazed at how seamless the digital like the midnight rollover

166
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,840
where everyone was logged off at midnight and then we all I mean it took us 20-30 minutes

167
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,560
to log back in for to access all the new areas. I don't even think it was that bad. Yeah and

168
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,200
then there's been no server crashes. Nothing. I thought that they did a great job in turning

169
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,080
that over compared to I guess Wrath and Burning Crusade. Yeah it could have been a lot worse.

170
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,140
They did a pretty good job. Awesome. Yes. Alright. Okay. What? Yes ma'am. When I get

171
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,780
back from Washington I'll play for a month. That's the spirit. Hey there's actually email

172
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,240
coming up about how you can do that for free so we're gonna get to that later. I know you

173
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,860
probably haven't peeked at the mailbag yet but somebody who listens to the other show

174
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,840
also listens to this one and sent a great tip so we'll talk about that when we get to

175
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,680
the mailbag. First though we gotta finish off gaming weeks. Arcadian 42. I know you

176
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,760
play a lot of, you have a pretty diverse lineup of games that you play right? Yeah. This week

177
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,860
hasn't been that too many games this week. One of them is Rockman 3 of course and also

178
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,820
played some more Super Meat Boy. That's fun. Isn't Super Meat Boy great? You haven't been

179
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,180
on the show since it came out but. Yeah so I've played it for a little while. The box

180
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:17,820
art, the name, terrible but the game itself, awesome. Yeah and it's really a thumb killer

181
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:25,400
too. I got one of the new Xbox controllers. I come out briefly that the D-pad's a little

182
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,740
bit better. I'm not sure if it's that much improved. It might hurt your finger a little

183
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,100
bit more than the original. Interesting. No I forgot those had come out. I knew they were

184
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,760
on there. I forgot that now's the season. Interesting. But it's nice having a better

185
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,700
charge back so that it lasts longer than the older one. Have you used that at all for Game

186
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,780
Room? I know you were big into Game Room for a little while. I've barely gotten done into

187
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,340
Game Room. Have you heard about what's come out in Game Room? Like this week, I'm not

188
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,180
even kidding, Twinbee and Daytona Twinbee both hit Game Room this week. And like Puyen

189
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,140
and like just all of a sudden out of nowhere Game Pack 12 was like bam bam bam like all

190
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:08,580
these huge titles came out. They're all Konami but it's almost like, hey why didn't you give

191
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,500
us this shit like three months ago? We might have paid more attention. I think I downloaded

192
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,180
those packs but I haven't actually because they were like taking a long time to download

193
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,060
so I went to some other game. And the main game I've been playing this week is Resonance

194
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,380
of Fate which is a triage game that Sega put out. It's a RPG. It's actually a pretty, it's

195
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,860
got an interesting battle system. All the characters use guns and so they have different

196
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,260
like they have like a machine gun and the other people have like guns and like thrown

197
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,060
weapons like grenades. So you level up by your weapon experience and basically you have

198
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:47,420
to think strategically because you have to move around the board because when you move

199
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,380
the enemies move and they charge up and everything. You have like the set number of like hero

200
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,700
gauge or like where you can have your character run across the fields like the other side

201
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,140
like most of the way to the other side of the field where you're pretty much shooting

202
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,820
at the enemy as many times as you can. But you have to like, sometimes you have to save

203
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,700
up charges because if you do that you get different status effects like your machine

204
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,820
gun you'll do more damage that you can make convert to real damage. Sort of a weird, sort

205
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,980
of a different like damage system. How old is this game? It came out a little while ago

206
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,220
right? March. Oh. Yeah it's about that long. I thought this was like an old old game. No

207
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,900
no it came out this year. I missed this one. Yeah. It's a 360 game? Yes it is. I've been

208
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,220
looking for a new RPG to play on 360. Yeah and there's probably several things you'd

209
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,460
like about it because the characters are interesting. They went into a lot of oddball kind of characters

210
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,220
that basically are going on different fetch quests and do this for me. Go to this area

211
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:58,340
and fetch me something. And yeah some of them are a bit crazy. But basically it's like a

212
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,740
series of vignettes and that kind of thing. At least for now because the overarching story

213
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,700
you don't really get to that until later and I haven't gone that far yet. But let me see

214
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,620
what. Actually the system map is a little bit interesting because it's actually a hex

215
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,140
map where you have to lay down these like little things of hexes that you have to put

216
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,220
down to get through the other areas and there's colors and everything like that. It's actually

217
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,180
a pretty interesting game. And also you can also play dress up with the characters because

218
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,380
you can actually buy all these different sort of clothes. It's just not a JRPG if there's

219
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:42,300
not dress up at some point. Going to chat with chat.orangemanstrator.com I'll let Arcadian42

220
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,220
finish but I wanted to get some of the comments here. Oh you're good? Let's see. Some folks

221
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,260
talking about the new controller that they're liking that. Azure Edge in our chat room says

222
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:58,620
I love the box for the new Xbox 360 controller. Also a question about game room. Rama says

223
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,340
didn't sunset riders drop too? No that's rumored that that is in the game pack. I'll tell you

224
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,460
what came out. I pulled up the list while Arcadian was talking there. Daytona Twinbee,

225
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:15,660
Puyen, Thwacker, Amadar, Off the Wall, Twinbee, Blades of Steel, Pitfall 2, Trick Trap, and

226
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,260
Vektron have all come out in the past three weeks. Yeah. Many hadn't checked them out

227
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,980
because they stopped updating their Facebook thing because of all the crowd stuff. Closures

228
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,020
and stuff so it kind of makes you forget to look. There's one thing about the new controller

229
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,460
that I didn't mention was that the analog sticks have this little lip in them so it

230
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,380
makes it might kind of hurt your finger a little bit more than the old one. So especially

231
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,420
with Super Meat Boy where you're jamming the controller left and right and up and down

232
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,820
all the time that can kind of bite into your finger a bit. Arcadian you know you're kind

233
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,020
of known as being like a quiet guy and you know you're playing games but usually you're

234
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,260
just you know you kind of you're quiet and you don't yell you're not obnoxious like I

235
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,980
am in crowds. But I have to ask like when you play Super Meat Boy are you the type that

236
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,540
just like fuck! I can't fucking believe I lost that level! God damn it! And you throw

237
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,300
the controller against the ground. Meow! Not really for this one just because it's so fast.

238
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,980
This one because like with Dead Rising 2 I was playing that and there was one point in

239
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,860
the game where I basically only place I could save was like a few a little bit before the

240
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,980
chef guy and where he's and I wasn't able to get from where I was saved I could barely

241
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,820
just get any enough weapons to actually fight him so like every time it's like just getting

242
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,620
killed by this guy over and over again so I got really pissed. That guy was making me

243
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,940
swear like like fucking crazy. There you go! Ahh there you go! Did you hear that? Yes.

244
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,080
Just thinking about it makes me fucking crazy! Yeah and the same thing with Kyle in the first

245
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,820
game that guy was an ass. Like fucking annoying as hell. It's always the quiet ones. But Super

246
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,780
Meat Boy just like oh damn damn oh well shit. And then go on and just do it again because

247
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,300
it's so fast you don't you don't really have to think about it just do it again. You have

248
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,860
to ask Leisha's Pop about when I play Super Meat Boy. It's pretty exciting. In fact he'll

249
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,320
even egg me on. He'll be like don't you want to play Super Meat Boy? Oh Rob you're so close

250
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,100
to beating that one level. Come on you should play Super Meat Boy. Come on just you'll have

251
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,900
that level beat in five minutes come on. It's like entertainment for him. Yeah that's mainly

252
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,620
the reason I haven't gone back to Dead Rising 2 because I'm sort of since I'm there I want

253
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,380
to beat it I don't want to go on and just because with Dead Rising 2 I can just pass

254
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,340
him up and let that that invent expire but I'd like to actually do it for this time going

255
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,060
through but maybe when I go back to it I'll just kind of I'll see if I can do it and then

256
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:41,900
just say fuck it and go on. Alrighty. Let's see going back to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

257
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,780
SolarFlare says I've been playing Resonance of Fate for PS3 makes me feel like I don't

258
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,320
know how to play JRPGs anymore. Dungeon Buster says Fates battle mechanics take a little

259
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,940
getting used to. I stopped playing it for a week or so and had to hit up easy encounters

260
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,620
all over again just to get back into the groove. So you know what else you know what other

261
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,980
controller I guess had come out recently I really want to get is that Tron controller

262
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,120
because the game came out and sadly I have missed the game although I hear it's not so

263
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,340
great like I guess the reviews are mixed at best so but I'm still curious you know I liked

264
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:18,280
what I played at E3 so reviewers don't always get it right either so. You're reading one

265
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,460
man's opinion that's all it really is. It's not a team of people reading it. What if it's

266
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,340
Metacritic where you're reading several people's opinions. Oh big deal it's a few people I

267
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,580
mean they're all over the board with stuff. There were some people that thought Gran Turismo

268
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,260
5 was awesome some that hated it there was I'm trying to think of one that had really

269
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:44,820
weird reviews on it. What was it? Might have been Epic Mickey because there were some people

270
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,860
that really loved Epic Mickey and people that hated it. I don't know it's gonna be like

271
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,740
that for everything. Now see this is the weird thing is that Tron Evolution supposedly has

272
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,180
a 58 on Metacritic right now and this is based on 6 critics but then I don't see critic reviews

273
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:05,420
so that makes me think okay they haven't really had that so I don't know whatever I guess

274
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,900
the movie only has like a 50 something too so yeah but people are dumb I mean they're

275
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,460
like the story. Movie critics you have to take with a grain of salt like I my expectations

276
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,980
for the Tron movie are very low like there's as long as it's pretty and at some point I

277
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,340
hear end of line I'm gonna be fine you know what I mean it's my expectations are set really

278
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:34,060
low all right have fucking wait six days six more days I know I heard a Tron rumor oh something

279
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:40,440
to do with OMG spoilers no okay something to do I think this is what how the story was

280
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:47,660
read but Disney is pulling the original Tron DVD from retailers because it's already done

281
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,640
it's been in the vault forever they're not gonna release it until later because I thought

282
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,600
that the way that it looks on the box art where it says Tron they don't want people

283
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,900
to go oh this is that movie that's in theaters right now so I'll just buy this when it's

284
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,640
a completely different movie I think what what the big deal is is that there is a remastered

285
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,560
one waiting to be released and they're not going to release it until after the movie

286
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,560
comes out really know a box that's coming you know a box that's gonna happen because

287
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,340
the they actually got the original animator back to go in and do all the touch-up work

288
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,020
and so that reminds me I need to watch the original Tron this week again because it's

289
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:32,220
been so long I barely remember I have it and the laserdiscs I was watching they had a really

290
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:40,240
it was on I think it might have been Gizmo it might have been Gawker I had it or one

291
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,240
of their I know they have like a comic one too that io9 or something like that anyways

292
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,480
they were covering like what like Tron and the stuff that they remember from it and it

293
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,560
clips and it's really like cheesy and slapsticky and like a lot of it well you know it was

294
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:04,200
it was the 80s but it really is very dated but it's still fantastic you know an awesome

295
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,440
place to try and find it on UMD they made it for the PSP on UMD I bet that would be

296
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,200
one of the easiest ones to find so probably still people trying to unload those discs

297
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,640
well actually don't let go of that mic there as I spoke oh wait no I already asked you

298
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,560
but you can we never mind let go of it I guess I'll talk about my gaming week everybody else

299
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,360
is gone mine I don't have a whole lot of exciting stuff to add because you know obviously it

300
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,120
was a big week with Cataclysm and just a big week personally I honestly have not had time

301
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,760
for a lot of games in general as I think a lot of people are right now with the holidays

302
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,320
and everything going on but I did of course play World of Warcraft Cataclysm which even

303
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,000
though I have a separate show for wow I have to mention some of the big stuff you know

304
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,540
obviously they've redone all the old content and I'm hearing the Worgen and Goblin experience

305
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,760
is amazing but you know I talked about on the other show for a little bit my experience

306
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,480
just going back and leveling a Gnome Priest which is one of the new race class combos

307
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,720
that you don't need Cataclysm for and it was neat a neat upgrade a lot of the mechanics

308
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,600
from Wrath of the Lich King you now find in the classic wow and I think that's what's

309
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,320
pretty cool because it allows it to have more vehicle type quests and kind of zany things

310
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,880
like today I was in Oldham and I got a daily quest to do a whack-a-mole type of quest it's

311
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,800
just kind of weird stuff and a lot of very meta things like the whole plants versus zombies

312
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,280
quest that they have now or peace balloon versus ghouls whatever there's a lot of silly

313
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:31,000
things in it but the core game is still great and the end game I haven't seen a lot of the

314
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,080
85 end game yet because I'm only about 83 and a third now but I've played some of the

315
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,280
new dungeons and you know it's it's still that same kind of look and feel of course

316
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:46,600
of the previous wow expansions but they have definitely taken strides to make it not so

317
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,900
face roll is the term a lot of people use where you know those Wrath of the Lich King

318
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,320
heroic dungeons were very face roll for the past three months I'm meaning you could just

319
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,280
sit there at the keyboard and just three three three three three or whatever your button

320
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,240
is pretty much roll your way through any dungeon you really have to take a step back and well

321
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,520
oh crap this is all new content I'm not over geared I have to think about this and you

322
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,400
know as a healer which I play in the game they made heals very expensive so now you

323
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,040
really have to think about do I really need to top this person off or should I go back

324
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,480
to focusing on the tank so lots of interesting little game mechanics like that but if you

325
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,280
want to know more about that I got the other show so we'll talk more about that as far

326
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,520
as other games that I played there were some free games that came out on Xbox this week

327
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,080
and one of them I don't even remember the name of it somebody in chat will jump in it

328
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,720
was one person plays a driver you drive around the course and the other person can shoot

329
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,060
the driver Doritos games yeah it's one of those Doritos games that sounds like an old

330
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:44,480
arcade game was it not the shoot it was like one person was the driver and the other person

331
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,920
had the gun and it was a two person arcade game you are thinking about like the I know

332
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,960
what you're talking about the tango and cash tango and cash yeah oh no uh lucky wild lucky

333
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,860
wild that was my mistake that's it no I I know what you're talking about though that's

334
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:09,120
neat looking it's stupid it's free but yeah it's free exactly it's it was better than

335
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,800
Yaris it was better than totem ball um you download the other one avatar crash I downloaded

336
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,820
it but I haven't played it yet because then I played more rock band 3 and I actually did

337
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,720
that whole thing in rock band 3 I was like you know I don't have any vocal achievements

338
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,080
what you need to do is you need to get in on the ground floor of these Doritos challenges

339
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,520
things and really that's where you propose the whole you know golden girls RPG Grand

340
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:39,640
Theft Auto type game I know I hope maybe for the next year's Doritos competition we will

341
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,040
have the golden girls with guns game that's just Grand Theft Auto with the golden girls

342
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,020
that's all I really want to say I'll have you know Doritos are kind of orangish it works

343
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,080
and the golden girls lived in Miami so they were kind of orangish you know what it just

344
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,760
occurred to me okay imagine like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game or the x-men game

345
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,120
or the Simpsons only with the golden girls I know right like Sophia hits them with that

346
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:11,560
giant purse uh-huh and like Blanche has the slut attack uh-huh and and Arthur Dorothy

347
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:19,060
Dorothy is sassy she has the bitch attack mm-hmm and basically I guess Rose would just

348
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,360
walk through the game clueless no she has stories about St. Olaf she has the St. Olaf

349
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:31,680
she has a goat that would come out yes hopefully maybe that'll come to indie marketplace because

350
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,120
that's that's where all the good ideas seem to go all right anyhow that was pretty much

351
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,360
my gaming week I don't even remember the name of that game and it's you know it's free it's

352
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,920
better than some of the other free offerings but at the same time I think it's Doritos

353
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,120
crash course or something like that no it I don't even think that's it either it's like

354
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,840
this tells you how memorable the experience was what an amazing game podcast we have here

355
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,240
where it's like I played some game I think the best thing to actually come out of that

356
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,240
was me bringing up another obscure game yes lucky a while was pretty awesome actually

357
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,020
and then the Golden Girls game chat was awesome too I'll remember in a minute thank you Doritos

358
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm trying to you know what I'm doing right now I'm actually clicking to my profile harm's

359
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
way that was the name of the game thank God thank God for the xbox.com tracking everything

360
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
that you play harm's way was the name of the game phew I would that's weird that chat didn't

361
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,160
beat me to that usually having the live chat room some people jump in with the game nobody

362
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,000
knew that game guess that should tell me right there because the chat room didn't care clearly

363
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,040
all right let's housekeeping real quick if you want to follow us on Facebook facebook.com

364
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,600
slash orange launch radio we can always use more fans there and of course Twitter ask

365
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,720
us some questions on Twitter we'll get to those in the second half of our show tonight

366
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:58,920
twitter.com slash o l r meanwhile let's get into the news tonight yes of course the ever

367
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:05,920
denied but absolutely coming psp2 more rumors about the capabilities of it since we don't

368
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,080
know too much about it yet there are people that are working with it they're saying that

369
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,000
the graphics are comparable to early playstation 3 titles says that the low resolution screen

370
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,400
will surely help minimize the quality gap between playstation 3 games and psp2 games

371
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:32,240
but they're saying that it should be rather easy to port ps3 games over to the psp2 which

372
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,760
sounds pretty impressive actually that sounds dang impressive but there's got to be a difference

373
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,320
in quality like I don't think that thing's gonna be sport and blu-ray or whatever here's

374
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,600
the thing though is you know the textures don't have to be as big I mean they can save

375
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,280
a lot because it's it's a smaller screen the resolution isn't going to be as you know big

376
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:56,000
as the playstation 3 and because of that they can do a lot of tricks kind of like for example

377
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,320
how they can do a lot of tricks with like you know infinity blade to make it look nice

378
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,600
on an ipad or an ipod because you know they do a bunch of texture tricks and stuff to

379
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,360
make it look like it's actually a higher resolution than it is and actually kind of the same goes

380
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:16,140
with even just the psp now um you know they have a lot of tricks to make things look better

381
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,400
so I'm not too concerned about that I think it's gonna be awesome and as long as I have

382
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,180
two you know dual analog six which is great yeah are we talking about having more synergy

383
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:30,440
between the psp and the playstation 3 with this because when there's a lot of neat tricks

384
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,520
that I don't think people even know about that the psp will do like with this whole

385
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,480
remote play yeah getting it to control your ps3 through the psp I bet you most people

386
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,200
don't even know about that I think but there's they could do it right now with the psp2 assuming

387
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,440
that they have two shoulder buttons which they really should on that I think that that

388
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,360
would be great because not only would you be able to do that with um you know like I'm

389
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,560
assuming that this will also be able to emulate playstation 1 games as well and possibly playstation

390
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,020
2 games later on down the line have downloadable for it um I mean that would be really cool

391
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:10,400
and then with the remote play yeah you would be able to probably you know play these games

392
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,640
to their full extent because you'll have the controls that are going to be mimicking the

393
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,920
same thing whatever happened to I remember at e3 when this thing was first announced

394
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:25,320
remember Ridge Racer and remember when they were using the psp as like a rear view mirror

395
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,720
did that functionality ever happen in a game like where the psp was kind of your controller

396
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,980
or your spin-off device or whatever from the playstation 3 like I don't remember that ever

397
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:43,320
actually happening did that technology just not play out um maybe somebody has had games

398
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,640
for that but not necessarily rear view mirror are we talking anything like actually really

399
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,240
cool are we talking like buzz will allow you to use the psp to buzz in you know what I

400
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,320
mean like I don't I'm talking about something actually kind of like different I don't remember

401
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,000
like nothing really stands out how you could visit the Animal Crossing village on your

402
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,680
Game Boy Advance when you played GameCube Animal Crossing remember that now that I remember

403
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:19,440
that awesome cheap mm-hmm all right so comment from a chairman chat on orange on twitter.com

404
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,080
game guru in our chat says I'd rather hear about the price points of the 3ds and the

405
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:34,480
psp2 any crazy idea what this might cost the psp2 I'd be willing to bet $300 or 250 do

406
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,880
you think 250 sounds I don't know it's hard to say depends what they're trying to push

407
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,880
on it I mean I could see it maybe as high as $300 because they're looking if they're

408
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,420
going to try to compare this say with like an iPod or like you know something of that

409
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:56,880
nature then you know iPods are like 200 $300 so they might be able to do that and it also

410
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,320
really depends on what the 3ds comes out at too I mean 3ds I would hope it'd be around

411
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:12,040
like $200 at the very most but it's hard to say Bobby Blackwolf in our charm says nothing

412
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,200
like pac-man versus on the GameCube no yeah because there was that whole pac-man game

413
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,960
on the GameCube where you could use what the advances I think were as the controllers the

414
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,320
ghosts or something no no pac-man would use that because he could see the whole screen

415
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,240
I don't remember but it was something it was something like that no the ghost would be

416
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:37,440
on the TV because they would you know be split screen on the TV I think and then pac-man

417
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,640
would be on the Game Boy Advance because pac-man could see the whole screen because the ghost

418
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:49,200
couldn't see where you were at all right because if it's on the TV the people with screen hack

419
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,120
and then black hole continues to say it was just a remote play where you could play the

420
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:59,320
same game on your PSP on your ps3 sometimes not every game even does that back and forth

421
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,600
either it's mostly the ps1 class and here's the funny thing about that too and you know

422
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,160
thanks to the hackers and stuff they found out that a lot of games that don't support

423
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,320
remote play actually could support remote play but they just don't they they've hacked

424
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,200
different games to support remote isn't usually a button issue or something no that's kind

425
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:25,560
of sad all right well also speaking of sad let's talk about Final Fantasy 14 because

426
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,240
there's actually this is uh this is kind of sad actually but but I think a lot of us said

427
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,120
this needs to happen here's the deal Final Fantasy 14 obviously the PC version came out

428
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,320
and it's been getting slammed back and forth and we were talking about people selling off

429
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,200
their stock and all this other stuff here's the thing the PlayStation 3 version of Final

430
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,960
Fantasy 14 it was announced this week that it is not coming out in March it will be coming

431
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,680
out indefinitely like they don't know when they have now said this game has been delayed

432
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,920
indefinitely and that is like one step short of saying just the whole damn thing is canceled

433
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,720
which is very very strange but here's um here's what they're saying about the CEO of Squeenix

434
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,080
Yoshiwata basically apologized for Final Fantasy 14 and said that the Final Fantasy 14 team

435
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:21,440
is restructuring there will be new leadership Hiromichi Tanaka the producer out Naoki Yoshida

436
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,480
in the new producer director and a lot of the other positions are being restaffed they

437
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,640
are quote working on a concrete plan outlining Final Fantasy 14's new direction it almost

438
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,640
sounds like they are just starting the damn thing over which is crazy like have we ever

439
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,320
had a game maybe there's got to be another MMO that's done something like this but just

440
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,700
basically nuke itself and start over is what it sounds like they're doing they have also

441
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:55,280
extended the PC free trial period until the new plan is implemented so that could be months

442
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,920
away if you own the PC version of Final Fantasy 14 for being an early adopter you might be

443
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,160
on that for six months or here's here's the great thing you guys after Christmas or even

444
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,760
maybe before those copies of Final Fantasy 14 are going to plummet in price and pretty

445
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,520
soon for about 20 bucks you'll be able to pick up the game and play for free online

446
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,560
indefinitely granted you won't be playing a great game but it will be cheap so there

447
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:27,760
you go so that's really interesting to me I think I had said on the show before that

448
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,120
I think I even used the phrase heads will roll at Squeenix and this is around the time

449
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,200
it was the episode wherever the news came up about the stock getting sold I said that

450
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,520
this is inevitable conclusion that this is really an embarrassment but I don't know if

451
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:48,760
I necessarily blame the producer who got canned over this as much as I blame whoever made

452
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,760
them put this out at Christmas this game was a year away from release and all of that year

453
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,520
the engine is pretty much done that the game runs in the graphics look great the sounds

454
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,160
fine the problem was all the like game mechanics weren't implemented there's no fucking auction

455
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:12,020
house in the game right now hello that's the problem who whatever executive or whatever

456
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:17,360
decision made them put this game out this year that's who needs to be canned in my opinion

457
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,320
because this game was a year away from being released in reality and so now it's back to

458
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,440
the drawing board yeah and I it just seemed like with them releasing it in September October

459
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,000
of this year you know a lot of people were saying well it's kind of a shit circus on

460
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,920
PC but they'll work out the bugs and maybe it'll play a lot better with a controller

461
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,760
in your hand and it'll be you know decent on the ps3 there'll be some you know bug fixes

462
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,760
maybe a little major patch that comes out and now it just sounds like okay this game

463
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,360
is so bad that the console they're like we're not even we're not we're not gonna try it

464
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,680
like this is awful it just is really stunning you have to wonder if at some point Sony is

465
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,480
actually come in and said we don't want this game on our console this game is a turd do

466
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,920
not put on our system like I bet that's exactly what happened and I think that it was this

467
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,320
whole oh no we stand by our product we stand by our product thing and keep hoping and hoping

468
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:20,700
it doesn't look um this is your reality check bang bang so uh dark Tetsuya in our chat room

469
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,660
says rob and don't forget the anti-addiction timer where they're where they cut off your

470
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:30,920
XP after so long I actually think a lot of that shit's been overblown because guess what

471
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,640
Warcraft has something similar but no one's talking about it World of Warcraft has something

472
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,680
very similar well forums are filled of and it better sour tears of the crime that the

473
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,200
anger it's the guild experience you can only gain a set amount of guild experience in a

474
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,080
week and I'll tell you what after this expansion was released I hit my week cap in a day and

475
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:00,960
a half and your guild together can only earn so much experience in a day and you get rewarded

476
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,960
when you don't play for a while you get double experience so I think a lot of this stuff

477
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,640
in 11 or I mean 14 excuse me was kind of overblown because it was what you could play like your

478
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,200
character for like 20 hours in a week before you started hitting penalties my understanding

479
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,640
with 14 is that it was the job system I don't know exactly what the names of the jobs were

480
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,840
but you couldn't min-max I don't know like leather working or whatever you had to trade

481
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,460
your job out for something else and then level that up yeah so they just wanted it wasn't

482
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:37,680
necessarily a OCD please take a shower and go to bed type thing but just you know it

483
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,460
wasn't it wasn't one of those it was just more you know we don't want you to min-max

484
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:49,200
one thing we want your character to be diverse zeba diversify zeba in our chair I think sums

485
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,240
it up very very bluntly with this one comment no chocobos either no mounts got to walk everywhere

486
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:03,640
it's not so much that but it's a Final Fantasy game with no chocobos that's like that's like

487
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:09,580
a Michael Bay movie with no explosion that's I that's an Anne Hathaway movie with no nude

488
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:17,560
scene what what is this I don't understand Tiger Claw on our charm says so Square Enix

489
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,980
just pulled an NBA elite and starting over kinda except they did it about three months

490
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,000
too late did they pull the game off shelves although they haven't really pulled the game

491
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,200
off shelves either it's just the copies on shelves currently are gathering a lot of dust

492
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,360
we'll see what happens also kind of along the same lines not only is there news about

493
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:44,240
Final Fantasy 14 but if you're kind of fed up with the current state of 14 maybe you

494
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,520
should go back to Final Fantasy 11 because there's a new expansion coming out in December

495
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,520
I don't think it's actually a official expansion it's just one of those like uber patches that's

496
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,220
gonna really change the game the level cap will be going up from 85 to 90 and there will

497
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,040
be a lot of new spells and abilities some new powers for blue mages because they get

498
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,040
monster abilities and so forth yeah and expansions I know are still coming out for this game

499
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,260
they're not retail expansions they're download expansions but this game still still trot

500
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,520
and ride along and with some of the screenshots you see that they pick you would think that

501
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,600
this game is a newer game they really are able to still sell this with some pretty screenshots

502
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,800
and I believe Steam whenever they have one of their sales which is all the time they

503
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:32,720
have a Final Fantasy 11 plus the 13 various expansions it's dirt cheap for like five bucks

504
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,200
nine bucks and I think it has a month that comes with it so yeah I get if 14 is that

505
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:44,260
bad check out the helipack on Steam for 11 yeah 11 is still cooking and it's doing pretty

506
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:50,320
well you know what 11 needs most of all though to lose PS2 support so they could like update

507
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,760
the engine you know what I mean yeah but at the same time a lot of people would like lower

508
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,440
end laptops and things that sort of able to run 11 you know because it is a PS2 game and

509
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,520
I'm sure there's PS2 Final Fantasy 11 players that are like shut your mouth Rob and you

510
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,080
know yeah I'm to bring up you know City of Heroes for the umteenth time they just had

511
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:14,280
a graphics update for going rogue but there's because it's an MMO that came out in 2004

512
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,640
there are people that are on computers from 2004 that are still running fine you can't

513
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,400
update the graphics too much because you're going to lose your subscriber base that's

514
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,600
been with you for six years so it's even if it was on the PC platform you still have that

515
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,720
limitation of you can't you can't force your subscriber base to go out and buy a new computer

516
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,960
just because the game is over X 90 years old so I'm interested in Final Fantasy 14 again

517
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,840
I will say though because you know what despite my criticisms of the game in the past I think

518
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,800
it is kind of big of square because I don't think a lot of companies would do this I think

519
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:52,520
some would say but this is it was an intended game feature right I think it's kind of big

520
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,680
a square to step up and say we've released the suck patch yeah okay we're going to redo

521
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,600
it and so now I'm like okay now maybe I can get excited about this game because now they're

522
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:09,620
going to put the year of time that it needed the first time into it I miss the flawless

523
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:16,080
godlike square where even their crap games smelled of vanilla and sang hosannas and now

524
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,920
they've made an actual shit bag of a game I know look at all the people that still love

525
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,800
Final Fantasy 8 to this day and like what a shit yeah during the ps1 era everything

526
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,960
and then saga frontier I'm just ruffling feathers because I know there's listeners out there

527
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,120
that are like you shut your mouth squall and zellen are awesome and lagoon oh my god yeah

528
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:40,800
the ps1 era you know saga frontier bad I'm hander good just square could do no wrong

529
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,080
Final Fantasy 7 and now it's like that this is what you've become look at yourself look

530
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,560
at your life look at your choices yeah solar flare in our chat room says now 14 is so bad

531
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:58,240
they are taking the guys from 11 that made 11 good and put them on 14 great because some

532
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,600
of the changes that 11 got like five years too late are actually made that game great

533
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,120
like the whole level sinking that's something that should have been put into the game about

534
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,200
a year after its release not five because you played 11 for about three years and it

535
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,960
still had a lot of problems and it finally I finally got sick of it like after honestly

536
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:22,240
after playing wow I couldn't take 11 anymore you know and I played 11 for like a week no

537
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,840
I played longer than that you did you were like and a couple months I was the queen of

538
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,040
doing all that crap on my controller too like I had all my macros set up on my trigger buttons

539
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,200
and I could do and it was just that one experience that finally was the straw and I'm like all

540
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,680
of you people suck and I'd left off in a big stomping diva huff so if it what solar flare

541
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:48,320
is saying like to hear that the guys that made 11 good are now gonna go make 14 good

542
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,840
wake me up when a release date is official for the ps3 version because this is now exciting

543
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:58,600
news again because the changes they made to 11 were great so this game stands the chance

544
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:04,160
to redeem itself on the PlayStation 3 but boy are they gonna have to fix the PC version

545
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,000
but you know what they'll do here's here's the easiest way all you do fix everything

546
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,440
with an expansion pack and just have the ps3 version include the expansion pack it's what

547
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,660
they did with 11 remember when 11 came out in the States it already had rise of the zillard

548
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:22,800
in it you could already play a dragoon you could already go to some new areas wouldn't

549
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,460
be anything new let's move on to some more stories dark Sakura well this is one of those

550
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:35,880
warm fuzzies and I really mean warm and fuzzy the charity child's play we know if Charles

551
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,600
play don't we of course they have capped the 11 million mark not 11 million mark when I

552
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,360
say 1 million mark it'd be nice if they kept the 11 million mark wouldn't it we just got

553
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:52,840
done talking about Final Fantasy 11 so you know but no they've capped they've reached

554
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,240
1.2 million American dollars in all their donations along with the desert bus for hope

555
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,800
and the penny arcade auction dinner and all kinds of stuff boom loud happened this week

556
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,880
and I'm unfortunately I didn't get to talk about it because I was unable to attend some

557
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,920
things in real life came up and it was one of those real life greater than video games

558
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,420
type of thing even when it's for a good cause which really is disappointing but that's what

559
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,560
happens when you live a hundred miles away from where the funds at so I wanted to go

560
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:26,560
but I had my algebra final I hear women really well though I hear we're like even I'm hearing

561
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,360
it was better than last year which last year I had a lot of fun so I'm I'm I'm really happy

562
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,700
to hear it and of course hearing about all this money that was made just collectively

563
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:40,880
amongst all the efforts of not just even the big stuff but the little stuff too that's

564
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,240
that's great and you know it's unfortunate that CNN won't report this but they'll talk

565
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:53,080
about the Xbox gamer that beat up a special needs child for his Xbox this which yes was

566
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,200
a story on this show about six months ago I think it's because good news doesn't you

567
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,700
know the more negative hype they raise the more chances they have of getting news out

568
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:10,700
of it you know and that's really pathetic it's just pitiful but this I think you know

569
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:18,640
they're there the next goal is working on I think 1.7 million from last year so I think

570
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,360
that they're still looking to reach that by the end of the year that would be great if

571
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,160
they could top what they did last year considering the state of the world and the economy and

572
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,360
all that that's a very aggressive goal but I think just taking all that into consideration

573
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,160
I think it's great that they've made it as far as they have I agree I definitely agree

574
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:46,040
I'm very pleased so there you go alright moving on Loki yeah I don't know the thing is this

575
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:56,160
is kind of ridiculous but they have added quests now on was it the PlayStation Network

576
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:03,440
for the rewards program and these quests are basically get you test out different things

577
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:10,840
for example they have one of the quests you can do kind of thing as like achievement check

578
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:17,580
your pulse which requires you to watch an episode of pulse on the PlayStation Network

579
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:26,400
or to play a PlayStation move game and you get the move it quest or the no place like

580
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,860
home quest which involves you visiting the central plaza and PlayStation home so will

581
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,600
I get like well if I successfully completed quest will my PlayStation 3 go it's dangerous

582
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:41,000
to go alone here take this and like give me candy or maybe a letter to take to the old

583
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,640
woman so that she'll sell me you know drinks well I don't know I I just have a laugh when

584
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:55,960
I saw this because it's like you know I can see when the quest mean find a purpose go

585
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:05,000
visit home because there is no purpose or really you know it's was it a salt it's really

586
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:12,020
awesome or sodium one I'm sorry yeah it just sounds like that they've that home is so useless

587
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:17,320
that they've added a layer of meta gaming on top of it just so that you logged on you

588
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:28,000
sat down just I don't know don't get dry hopped by you for the furry exactly damn dark Tetsuya

589
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:35,140
says so when will olr start giving out quests okay go leave a five-star review for the show

590
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:43,040
on iTunes and you get a sticker go tell something nice about olr to a friend of yours and get

591
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:52,080
a high-five get permabanned by dark Sakura feet of strength you can only do it once no

592
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:57,400
no no that's we don't want them to achieve that you don't want somebody to achieve that

593
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,640
I don't know that anyone's ever pissed me off to get permabanned yes yeah I have well

594
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:08,920
I know they have one person I permabanned I think there might be two I think the person

595
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:18,000
I didn't permabanned them I just well whatever anyway my point is so so what is the reward

596
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,560
is the reward just a virtual like trophy style thing or do I actually get like I don't know

597
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:29,440
like a discount on a game or a I don't know a certificate in the mail a spot on the cast

598
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:37,800
of tester three what well what the PlayStation rewards are is you get free PlayStation or

599
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:44,960
bonuses and apparently they're for fans they didn't really say I don't think what the bonuses

600
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:54,720
were it says tiger rewards free it says they'll be open the PlayStation over regards the plus

601
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:01,320
status it think of it like Club Nintendo or screening Square Enix members PlayStation

602
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,860
rewards is tiered separating its members into three groups select pro and legendary playing

603
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:11,000
games downloading demos using PlayStation home being active in the PlayStation.com forums

604
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,560
and then I guess at the end of the year something they'll say okay this tier gets this this

605
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:20,640
tier gets that this tier gets this and be done with it deathwishings wants to know how

606
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:27,360
do you sign up I believe you do if I want to say they have their own dedicated website

607
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:33,720
to that take a look here meanwhile while you're looking for that Tiger Claw in our time says

608
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,520
I think you would get a perma ban if you left a one-star review so don't know you won't

609
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,000
get a perma ban but I'm gonna bring sure me over to your house and start talking about

610
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:50,260
the tester that's what I'll do excellent in our chat room hypothesizes that you get assigned

611
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:57,480
autograph of Kevin Butler I'm not sure it doesn't really say what it is because I don't

612
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,960
think it's fully launched it it's still in beta so right now you have to they say you

613
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:10,520
have to be a highly-engaged member well I don't know if it's PlayStation Plus it says

614
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,180
you have to be a highly engaged PlayStation owner meaning you got to be posting on their

615
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:23,400
forums and playing home some similar features as PlayStation Plus says the only difference

616
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,120
I guess it is reward is free I don't know it's it's just a gimmick to get you to try

617
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,720
all the stuff that they have out there like renting videos and stuff like that they want

618
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:37,440
to try that no thanks you know steam has something similar ish going on right now it's not quite

619
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,120
as as you know bold as you know trying to get you to go into home and all that stuff

620
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,880
but they have like these quest thing going on right now where you play certain games

621
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,320
and once you get like actual achievements like I think one of them was for the game

622
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,440
droplets you had to get a certain amount of points and that was like one of four options

623
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:59,480
but one of the other options was sign up for an official games fan club so one of them

624
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,440
was something you didn't have to actually own in a game to do and then like other ones

625
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:08,320
would be things and I think what they do like they draw a name it's a scavenger hunt yeah

626
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,220
that's what it was like scavenger hunt and then like they draw a name from all the people

627
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,480
who have submitted badges you get like what is it like a hundred free games or some shit

628
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,640
crazy that they do on steam with their sales so it's this sounds similar except for the

629
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,560
fact that steam I know what I'll get like if I do enough of these I get free games yay

630
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,040
oh there you go.

631
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,040
Other stuff going on on other consoles how about the Wii we haven't had a lot of Wii

632
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:39,400
news tonight and the uDraw game tablet came out not that long ago and we were kind of

633
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,600
wondering if it was going to be a hit or a miss it sounds like it might actually have

634
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,600
been a hit THQ has said that they are going to continue to support the uDraw Wii through

635
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:53,400
2012 the chief financial officer Paul Pashino started to kind of give us some specifics

636
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,040
as to what that was going to include at the UBS global media and communications conference

637
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,160
he said that four to five titles will arrive from THQ in the next fiscal year meaning April

638
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,760
to April so April 11 to March 2012 however you don't know exactly what games are coming

639
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:21,120
out except there will be a SpongeBob SquarePants game there you go so there it is otherwise

640
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:27,380
as far as the other games go we don't know yet stop asking if it's Mario Paint just stop

641
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:33,200
we want to see it happen too but seriously we haven't heard anything like that yet so

642
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:40,300
just let it go let it go oh Mario Paint but it better have the music mode in it that was

643
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:50,360
awesome-tastic well how about something different how about connect sound like fun sure I haven't

644
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:57,800
touched mine in a week well the the tech firm that made the camera sensor actually released

645
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:04,840
open source drivers for the connect and that way means that basically you can do pretty

646
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:13,680
much whatever you want with it it's developed put out I think they said that is the prime

647
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:20,000
sense which is the company that did it there is really that's really cool anyway has set

648
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,320
up all kinds of stuff out there for it so that'd be pretty cool it's the open and I

649
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:32,760
framework has an API for writing and I apps and offers middleware that allows RGB D sensors

650
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,840
like the connect and let you use it so these connect hack stories are kind of a dime a

651
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,280
dozen now I mean that you know everybody's hacked their connect 10 ways from Sunday I'm

652
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,520
kind of curious what this means like okay so there's an open source connect driver that's

653
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:53,560
cool so indie game developers could use this sort of thing but this doesn't mean anything

654
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:58,440
official can happen right because an official company would not be able to use an open source

655
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,080
connect driver and expect to have their game embraced by Microsoft Microsoft already said

656
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:08,400
they were excited to see what my really be able to do as long as they stayed in the law

657
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:15,040
real okay that's interesting then with that coming to mind do you think there's the possibility

658
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:21,720
we could see like a actual you know big game publisher try to do something with connect

659
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:28,220
on the PC maybe but I'm more thinking that they're leaving it open for the indie type

660
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:34,600
stuff happening on PC I'm also kind of surprised though that with connect being like that must

661
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,840
have holiday toy that they're not letting it embrace the PC side a little more I mean

662
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:43,840
I get it they're not doing that because they want to sell more xboxes that's what's going

663
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:51,160
on but I'm still kind of surprised they're not outside of this one comment it's not being

664
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:56,980
a little more embraced because imagine if you know the people at whatever sales store

665
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:02,120
like Gamestop or whatever could more openly advertise hey this device it runs on your

666
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:10,400
360 and your PC you can play biggest loser with Jillian Michaels on your PC woo my thought

667
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,680
is that Microsoft is actually going to have some sort of cross-promotion going on between

668
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:21,340
a PC side and do something that's already optimized for PC or at least quote optimized

669
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:26,360
for PC so that they can get more sales out of it but then again my other thought too

670
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,200
is that if they were going to do that then the holiday season would have been the time

671
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,800
I maybe next holiday because I think this holiday they want to sell xboxes gaming on

672
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:44,120
PC in their eyes I don't think is very huge people do it but it's not like you know it's

673
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:48,240
not like you have PCs in your living room but don't they keep trying with the games

674
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,760
for Windows relaunches yeah but that's different though that people have laptops and people

675
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,640
game on laptops you know or whatever on the go or when they're traveling or you know maybe

676
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:04,240
even at home and stuff but they're not going to have like the Kinect that requires you

677
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:09,800
to have some sort of camera and most people do not have PCs hooked to their TVs in their

678
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,640
living room there's that's why they want console there because they they're trying to sell

679
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,840
that kind of experience for people I don't think that they're really going to have this

680
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:24,980
they may have similar technology down the line or something that may be built into something

681
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:31,960
like a all-in-one PC or like a laptop or something where you can do different gestures to navigate

682
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:38,500
around crap maybe like a new Windows Media Center or something like that but I don't

683
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:44,720
think they're going to actually try to push the Kinect for a PC market unless unless they

684
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,080
did have some sort of like you were saying for one of those because you know Vista has

685
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:53,640
all this ease of access stuff built in I mean they could technically have well they had

686
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,120
already created I'm not saying that Microsoft did this but there was already a device that

687
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:06,760
technically read brain patterns so that someone could think type you know what I mean and

688
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:13,360
yeah it took them you know two minutes to write an entire sentence but if they had the

689
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:19,600
Kinect technology set up for say that you've got a quadriplegic you know they can maybe

690
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:24,880
move their head that would be the perfect type of accessibility and open up you know

691
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,640
a universe to people who didn't have that opportunity before and that that's another

692
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,480
reason why I'm actually glad to see that I like to see those types of things come out

693
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,840
and not just you know get a little hacks.

694
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,400
Let's see, I'm going to the chat room at chat.orangeworm.com.

695
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,920
Game Guru says I'm still trying to find an Xbox 360 controller for the PC and not resort

696
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,840
to a cord.

697
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,560
It's difficult to do but you can do it.

698
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,940
It's called an Xbox 360 wireless gaming receiver.

699
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:05,200
You can buy these it's a little dongle for your PC and it doesn't just work with the

700
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,480
controllers it works with the wireless adapter too if you have one of the Xbox 360 wireless

701
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,960
voice adapters because that was actually my Warcraft chat for quite a long time I used

702
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:21,240
one of those so if you are really against cords which I don't see why oh Loki even has

703
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,480
one he's holding up right here in studio that he's using do I is there like a little barcode

704
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:30,480
on the back of this or anything no it's called the Microsoft Xbox 360 wireless receiver for

705
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,680
Windows would you take a picture of that and put it on our lovely orangewormsradio.com

706
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,680
blog?

707
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,360
They're good for wireless controllers which I use in my laptop.

708
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:43,640
Yep so that's what you need I'm looking at frugal right now they're about 20 bucks on

709
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:48,440
various websites so take a peek I don't know if they make them officially anymore I think

710
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:53,040
you have to buy them no they still do do they yeah they just might be a little bit harder

711
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,840

01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:27,400
Niko no Naku Koro ni Majo 2-3 no Rinbu Kyoku comes out this week I have no idea what this

728
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,320
is although one of the screenshots Heka looks like Phoenix Wright it says it's like the

729
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:37,380
PC version I guess this is an adapter or an adaption of the PC version it's an adventure

730
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:44,100
novel adaptation but that does not look like Phoenix Wright objection oh yuck there's a

731
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:49,960
girl who got stabbed with something this does kind of seem like a crime type game or something

732
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:54,680
maybe it's a different company's answer to Phoenix Wright I don't know maybe maybe moving

733
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:59,720
on to other consoles on the Nintendo Wii monopoly here and now the world edition because I know

goo for iPad and on the 18th battlefield bad company to Vietnam which is a whole whopping

741
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:51,520
three days before the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 release it all right kind of a slow people

742
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,840
slow gaming week unless you're in Japan I guess all right and even then it's mostly

743
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:00,120
localizations of stuff that for a change came out in the US first as opposed to the other

744
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:06,840
way around Loki has another story for us and so do I and we're gonna get to the classic

745
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,200
game of the week where dark soccer's gonna pull a game from the archives and I will say

746
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,020
she did go way back in the archives this week and it's it's a game that even I remember

747
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:21,840
and I used to like to which is I'll tell you this much is a Sega game surprise but it's

748
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:28,680
one that I remember and so we'll get to that in a minute Loki well there's still more progress

749
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:35,160
going on in Australia to approve a new rating for video games to allow adult themed video

750
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:43,720
games to be released in Australia I had already passed the federal cabinet and they've approved

751
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:52,200
that but now it's in the hands of the committee of attorneys generals and apparently they

752
01:08:52,200 --> 01:09:00,420
right now have some they haven't made a decision regarding it yet apparently they said that

753
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:08,880
gamers have grown and we have a deal we have to deal with the convergence of film and games

754
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,120
and basically right now they haven't really come to a conclusion whether going to pass

755
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:18,440
it or not but I mean it's the federal cabinet thinks it's okay and you know gamers think

756
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:25,920
it's okay so we'll just have to see it's about our time I think they should mean hell if

757
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:32,480
anything you know Australia always seems to have like the cliche you know menly men and

758
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,920
you know they're tough in the Thunder from Down Under is that what you're talking about

759
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:42,640
or not like not necessarily that but I don't know it just seems kind of Rob that's a dish

760
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:50,320
it out back Astroper review which I think is what he was referring to but isn't asked

761
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:55,200
Australia also the country that bans a lot of games outright like I seem to remember

762
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:03,360
they have this if this goes in place and they will have a way to classify those games solar

763
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,880
flare in our time says oh I heard about this on zero punctuation guy made a big fuss about

764
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:13,240
it doesn't make a big fuss about everything that was kind of a joke that's what I thought

765
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:18,360
alright moving on to another story this has to do with the VGA is of course where last

766
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:25,480
night the video game awards on Spike TV and you know what I'm over it like I don't really

767
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,520
watch it because I know all the news is going to hit the internet five minutes later which

768
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:34,160
is exactly what I thought they were today but whatever whoops I want to see just because

769
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:38,200
Neil Patrick Harris is gonna be hosting and he's awesome how can they make the VGA is

770
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:43,720
more tolerable more Neil Patrick Harris that that's true but also I think they should just

771
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:49,600
stop trying to make it cool because when people who don't like there's so many people I think

772
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,200
to try to make the VGA is cool like you know this is cool you guys we're gonna we're gonna

773
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:59,200
do this really cool segment of a dick and fart joke it's gonna be really funny they're

774
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,300
just trying it's like you don't know anything about video they're just trying to make it

775
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,720
like the MTV Movie Awards and that's and you know what's sad is they do a better job than

776
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:13,880
G fordas this is G for you even on anymore not if you're on direct TV no no no I understand

777
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,480
that but I'm saying do they even have their award show anymore I don't think they do we

778
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:23,080
just scared sure me out with the talk of G for I think that got relegated to a segment

779
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:28,680
on X play was what happened unless you for you now is you know best episodes of cheaters

780
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:36,160
all right well there were some pretty big stories that came out of the VGA is even though

781
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:41,620
you know most of it was like just little teases just just little teases like I know something

782
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:48,840
you don't know but what are the big trailers of course was Elder Scrolls V Skyrim not a

783
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,640
damn piece of gameplay in the trailer just some dragon waking up and you know narration

784
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:59,420
which but that was enough for me to go what was the dragon waking up in narration going

785
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:07,480
girl I'm a dragon I'm waking up for another Elder Scrolls game that's right oh yeah that's

786
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,540
exactly actually what it sounded like no here I'll play I happen to have a link to the trailer

787
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:19,480
right here let me see if I can play a dragon y'all I'm waking up how's it going nothing

788
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:26,520
like that stop it well this girls yeah hold on I'm trying to play some of the trailer

789
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,960
here and the stupid websites like what's your date of birth because the content here no

790
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,560
it's not really the world premiere here you guys let's see if I can can I jump forward

791
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:46,420
and like just play I hate live radio sometimes half the buffer this is stupid there you go

792
01:12:46,420 --> 01:13:06,900
see look stone stuff and a Bethesda logo and really passionate narration anyhow there it

793
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:11,840
is it's coming out in November 11 2011 that's what they announced is the release day good

794
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:17,120
luck meeting that release day just saying these ads always very specific release date

795
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:22,120
and not something that they made to get you know plan a gimmick of a you know year or

796
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,600
anything like that dark Tetsuya says Loki should totally be the voice of a gay dragon

797
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:34,100
in a video game yes he should I like this as a grassroots campaign no Loki you need

798
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:39,920
to be a gay dragon it was just a has anyone watched Family Guy you have something again

799
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,360
do they not do they not know of like was it the one guy who talks in there all the time

800
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:51,560
like hey I'm a bee you know I'm not sting you oh I've stung myself that's all I was

801
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:57,100
mocking I mean I am not playing a gay dragon in anything that's dumb that's just like people

802
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:01,360
trying to get me to be the voice of tingle no not gonna happen yeah I enjoy dressing

803
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,880
up like tingle or anything that has to do with tingle because that character is retarded

804
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,000
if they make some sort of epic Mickey type game with all the Nintendo characters and

805
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,080
yeah he'll be in there with what was that captain rainbow yeah anybody remember captain

806
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:22,000
rainbow yeah I didn't think so I enjoyed the Family Guy parody of aliens that had that

807
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,200
character in it oh you're trying to escape with that little girl I'm gonna bite you with

808
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:36,520
my second face now oh no it's the airlock oh no I have to see that no maybe salacious

809
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,360
pop needs to be the gay dragon would you be a gay dragon salacious pop he's nodding he'd

810
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,560
do the gay dragon here you go all right uh and tiger claw is saying isn't it 11-1-11

811
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:51,920
which is a Tuesday it's not gonna come out then anyway it's gonna get delayed these games

812
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,080
always do here's the thing though despite the fact that the trailer didn't show us really

813
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:00,320
anything new I'm just happy that it wasn't a trailer for a multiplayer Elder Scrolls

814
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:05,360
Oblivion don't get me wrong that would have been kind of cool like four years ago but

815
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:10,280
now it's time to move on to a new game so I'm uh I'm excited also some other things

816
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,320
that were revealed at the VGA is there's going to be a Mortal Kombat game on the PlayStation

817
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:19,480
3 oh wait we already knew that but this trailer had Kratos in it that's right Kratos is going

818
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:25,580
to be a playable character in Mortal Kombat on the ps3 so now him and scorpion can just

819
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:30,040
keep driving hooks into each other it'll be fun which is exact you know and whenever all

820
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:36,120
they need is pinhead from hellraiser to come out and it'll be hooktastic I you know when

821
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:41,040
I heard the news that Kratos was in it that was captain hook that was exactly the uh the

822
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,680
thought that came to my mind was get over here no you get over here get over here go

823
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,820
and sir I will take you both to hell that's what the trailer was was him and scorpion

824
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:56,760
fighting oh and mass effect 3 and there was a trailer for it and uh it's coming out holiday

825
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:04,480
2011 and I'm sure a lot of fanboy excitement going on over that one because mass effect

826
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:11,360
is a very popular series there it is anyhow uh let's get into the classic game of the

827
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:16,940
week it's a segment here on the show we can take a look at gaming's past you know screw

828
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:25,320
this elder scrolls 5 jib jab and all this uh you know talk of Kratos kids newfound fangled

829
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:30,960
game characters I remember a time when they looked pixelated and we liked it right dark

830
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:36,040
soccer what's the classic game of the week the classic game of the week is wonder boy

831
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:48,520
in monster land it was put out by westone it came out on the master system it was in

832
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:54,840
the arcades um in 1987 but it came out on the master system in 1988 um uh Activision

833
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:00,300
released it for the Amiga in 87 it came out on Commodore 64 the armstrad CPC ZX Spectrum

834
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:08,280
and Atari ST in 1989 um it came it was titled super wonder boy monster world in Japan and

835
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:14,960
then super wonder boy in monster land in Europe my cartridge of this says super wonder boy

836
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:22,520
super monster land so inconsistent I don't know um it actually was retooled um for the

837
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:30,400
Famicom by uh Jaleco and it was uh redone as a version of journey to the west um Hudson

838
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:37,080
soft um brought it out for Famicom and PC Engine to be like a big hoodie man I guess

839
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:46,000
uh it came out um in Brazil as uh Monica no Castello though drag I guess I don't speak

840
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Portuguese but I do know that they speak Portuguese in Brazil okay um and it was actually based

841
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,760
off of the Monica's gang comics that were in Brazil and it came out on mobile phones

842
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:04,920
in 2005 and for the virtual console in 2008 in Japan in 2009 over here in Europe it was

843
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:11,000
a sequel to the 1986 game wonder boy and it's 11 years after that game where everything

844
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:22,260
is peaceful and the evil king tom tom uh basically uh was gone and then uh wonder boy a fire

845
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:29,880
breeding dragon showed up and uh basically uh wanted to go in and conquer wonderland

846
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:34,220
putting it into monster land and crap happened so wonder boy popped up and he's like okay

847
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:41,360
I'll kill the mecha dragon whatever so anyway a lot of this is like I never cared about

848
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:50,080
the story when I was playing this I was like yeah got a sword so anyway um it uh had some

849
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:55,920
slow uh load times on the computers had some issues but it was super fun the master system

850
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:04,280
version is indeed the best home version that there is in my opinion that of many others

851
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:10,800
so um the way that it plays is you actually start off in the city of wonder without anything

852
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,240
um but the city's mayor gives you a sword and a revival potion and off you go it has

853
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:23,240
12 levels each of them have its own neat features and monsters and crap you use a d-pad to move

854
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:27,640
around and you got magic weapons that you can select and all kinds of skipping and jumping

855
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:34,440
and smiting things you have a life meter that starts uh that is uh red hearts and more you

856
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,400
can build them up as you go you start off with five and when you hit damage they turn

857
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:46,760
black kind of like zelda and you can get gold by uh killing things because apparently when

858
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:52,360
monsters die they barf gold or um you can hit trees and clouds because gold hangs out

859
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:58,680
in clouds all the time you also have an hourglass timer and when the hourglass runs out wonder

860
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,400
boy starts losing life but you can refill it by collecting more hourglasses in hospitals

861
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:07,080
or taverns because that's always where i look for my hourglasses is with some beer or sick

862
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:11,320
people of course of course gold hangs out in clouds where do the golden showers come

863
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:19,120
from on the zx spectrum version you had a candle for your timer for the master system

864
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:24,960
version you had a status screen so it's just to show you what you got how much uh gold

865
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,760
you have what your armor your equipment because i carry a status screen around with me all

866
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:35,360
the time too um i just usually whenever you see me drowning out it's usually i'm looking

867
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:40,360
at my status screen going damn i need more stuff um you also have the uh magic weapons

868
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:46,080
like i said before you have bombs that roll on the ground and fireballs and tornadoes

869
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:51,160
because i also carry tornadoes in my pocket and a thunder flash that damages everything

870
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:57,200
on the screen um so basically there's lots of little secret stuff in there it looks like

871
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:04,560
the character also in his weakest form is wandering around in a diaper yes all this

872
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:10,880
talk of golden showers and diapers is making me very sick just but it is one of the earlier

873
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:16,960
um roleplay games action adventure roleplay it was pretty fun came out on a bunch of stuff

874
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:24,000
like i said before and wonder boy in monster land is one of the uh i'd say one of the top

875
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,800
uh master system games and and really not surprised you know that it got its own special

876
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:36,680
release in brazil because they love the master system in brazil oh my gosh seriously there's

877
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:43,600
like like so many sega games were retooled like genesis games even were retooled to come

878
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:53,120
out on the master system because they love the master system in brazil um it it did really

879
01:21:53,120 --> 01:22:00,760
well um got some pretty high uh ratings for uh like the lowest of its ratings were the

880
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:07,320
amiga followed by the commodore 64 master system though really really hit the top of

881
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:14,840
the the top of the chart and uh there were other games came out you know along the same

882
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:20,800
lines monster boy the wonder boy monster land though i'd have to put that up at pinnacle

883
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:29,000
all right and you know what i'm gonna check my status screen now there it is your classic

884
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,240
game of the week wonder boy in monster land arkadian i know you like the sega games you

885
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,680
have any fond memories of this one i've only played this one a little bit the thing is

886
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:43,440
i played before i played this one i played the third one once you are it's like the monster

887
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,980
boy third that's a monster boy uh wonder boy three the dragon's trap which is actually

888
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:52,520
one of my favorite games into a dragon i don't know if you i don't know isn't like right

889
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,380
at the start of the game you get turned into a monster yeah yeah it is because yeah you're

890
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:59,000
fully powered up at the beginning and then they once you defeat like defeat the dragon

891
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,760
there he puts a curse on you so you basically turn it into something yeah and then you have

892
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:08,720
to turn it into various other other creatures for the whole game and y'all yeah so that's

893
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:12,200
definitely you should look into that game for the future this is what i've got to play

894
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,720
this one a little bit and it's kind of hard at the beginning this is one of the cartridge

895
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,980
by the way and take a picture of it this is one of the few master system games i remember

896
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:23,100
playing that's why i was kind of excited to see this as the pick now some of the chatters

out of uh the spike video game awards um actually earlier this week they announced that uncharted

938
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:13,060
3 drake's deception is coming out now we know that it's coming out sometime in 2011 my guess

939
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:20,500
would be the fall and um apparently the game will fate will feature drake and partners

940
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:26,580
sully uh hunt for a lost city and journey that leads them to the arabian peninsula and

941
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:33,500
rubel cali desert and uh they said that the story not only lists from the life of sir

942
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:42,420
francis drake but also the british army officer and archaeologists te lawrence as in arabia

943
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:47,260
and uh this was kind of shown off a little bit um during the vga's and also they had

944
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:52,820
a preview in entertainment weekly that's crossing over for you now isn't it and of course you

945
01:27:52,820 --> 01:28:01,020
know the movie that's gonna suck because mark fortunately mark walberg can be a good actor

946
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:06,140
sometimes and sometimes he can't act his way out he was in that movie the happening that

947
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:12,780
is all i have to say but he was good in um he ran from the wind loki okay but he was

948
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:17,380
good in another movie though uh nights no not that wasn't his peen just so you know

949
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:22,380
you know you know what he actually um the best thing i've ever seen him do was his uh

950
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:26,340
interview on top gear there was a movie where he was with uh leonardo dicaprio or something

951
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:32,220
like that um it was like some mobster i'll take your word for it but he was good in that

952
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:40,940
but yeah happening kind of wish it didn't happen but the riff track is awesome seriously

953
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:47,900
if you got to watch that movie once in your life watch it with the riff tracks um other

954
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:55,540
fun stuff and this is um kind of cool because it's been out on the pc and um the we but

955
01:28:55,540 --> 01:29:01,780
now playstation 3 owners will get the chance to play strong grads cool game for attractive

956
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:11,700
people uh be coming out on um december 21st and it's also coming to mac as well um doesn't

957
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:16,460
really say what the pricing is going to be yet but apparently um you know they're saying

958
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:23,140
in comparison the pc right now all five episodes are um on sale for 29.95 so something maybe

959
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:30,100
around that price um that's kind of cool and then finally just you know rama is screaming

960
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:35,180
in the chat that the departed was a good movie that was the part yes that's the one that

961
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:44,800
he was in so um and finally uh if you're a fan of quake quake arena arcade is finally

962
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:50,180
coming to xbox live arcade on december 15th so you can uh check that out it's very similar

963
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:55,180

964
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:58,980
in a very long time i'm really excited about and i hope other olr people are gonna play

968
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:23,740
say if it's going to be a little different i thought it was going to be kind of similar

969
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:28,980
to the one that they have right now like the uh browser game but maybe not i don't know

970

01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:58,340
say goodbye to hollywood the entertainer the stranger we didn't start the fire you may

1014
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:06,980
be right and there are um i think which one has the expansion pressure has the uh pro

1015
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:13,700
base expansion available so you know what there's a song that i should send you it's

1016
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:17,740
the best recording of it i have weird al one of his live songs is it still billy joel to

1017
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:24,780
me nice yeah i also speaking of billy joel there's this random warcraft video out there

1018
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:30,220
where they did like the lyrics to we didn't start the fire but it's like the characters

1019
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:34,980
running through storm wind that was dumb yeah it it's more of one of those things where

1020
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:39,980
you go wow this is really dumb but a lot of work went into this really dumb project that

1021
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:45,860
they pulled off pretty well i don't know uh salacious pop was was over when i was playing

1022
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:51,180
it and you could hear the song playing and he was like ah you watching that video yeah

1023
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:55,660
i knew exactly what it was when you started playing by the way that is the proper response

1024
01:35:55,660 --> 01:36:00,780
for that video and i was like i know exactly what that is it's not that great it's kind

1025
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:05,100
of cool they got 60 people to waste an hour while someone ran frat and it wasn't even

1026
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:09,580
60 people it was a bunch of just different people because you saw them like running because

1027
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:18,780
they had time to get to the new next position yeah yeah yeah sorry dark soccer i just was

1028
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:23,060
mesmerized by the next story well you're going to share with our listeners you're just going

1029
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:27,380
to sit there and watch it um the next two characters that are going to be out for marvel

1030
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:32,420
vs capcom 3 is crimson viper and storm and i don't give a shit about crimson viper because

1031
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:39,700
crimson viper stands for cheap bitch but storm cool and it's even her uh more current comic

1032
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:45,860
book outfit too so uh this is uh pretty awesome even though right now magneto's kicking her

1033
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:53,860
in the face um also storm has a very impressive rack in this game so that's important yes

1034
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:58,860
yes it is very important but of course it's looked like that her attacks might be actual

1035
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:07,020
actually uh taken from um her old uh x-men versus street fighter just completely done

1036
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:13,460
up and made incredible it's really pretty her uh ice storm attack is really really nice

1037
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:22,180
and crimson viper is a cheap bitch she's hot though literally well yeah but why couldn't

1038
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:28,020
they have put in um what's her face with the glowing feng shui there's going to be like

1039
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:35,100
11 billion characters in this game anyway they can hey capcom put in strider here you

1040
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:40,420
the end oh look there's morgan's or give us just a new strider game the end or bring strider

1041
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:46,100
from the nes to the virtual console no i like that one i'm sorry it was based on it was

1042
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:51,500
based off the comics and i know you're not a fan of the nes one it's like sega for life

1043
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:57,340
one one one but uh the nintendo one was rad except for the triangle jump the triangle

1044
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:01,340
jump can burn in hell for eternity but the the whole difference between that one and

1045
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:05,760
the arcade slash genesis slash everything else version is that the nest one was based

1046
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:13,780
off of the comics that came out the straighter here you manga so i'm i'm wow and dude black

1047
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:19,380
spider-man that's awesome okay so how about some uh other other other other news and this

1048
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:28,940

1057
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:27,240
a ton of the quests so go up date fallout new vegas all right let's get to the twitter

1058
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:33,340
topics let's go check the tweeter and uh see what folks are tweeting us this week twitter.com

1059
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:38,020
slash olr if you want to interact with the show you want to say hey the twitter is a

1060
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:41,400
good way to do that let's start with a tweet from blue swim tonight you remember blue swim

1061
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:47,860
was the techno kitten adventure tweet that started that whole stuff all right this tweet

1062
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:51,160
probably won't inspire an interview but it's interesting nonetheless it has to do with

1063
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:59,620
a connect flying machine that's right apparently it's this whole thing where you do this mini

1064
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:05,420
you have this mini copter and it sees itself in the connect and it avoids obstacles by

1065
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:10,020
detecting them on the connect and it knows its own altitude it's crazy i guess there's

1066
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:14,540
a backup motion capture device involved in everything but there's a youtube i have to

1067
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:18,400
mute santa there for a minute so we can look at the youtube here in studio of this thing

1068
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:23,160
in motion and i guess you can kind of actually see like how the connect senses things around

1069
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:28,640
and now there there goes the copter it's flying all by its lonesome and i guess this guy's

1070
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:31,680
going to take a cardboard tube and like try to whack it out of the air but it's going

1071
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:35,720
to know that it's there and it'll say like oh i better fly away from that he's not trying

1072
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:42,980
hard enough yeah he needs to be faster you could do like real baseball with this have

1073
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:47,120
a baseball just floating in mid-air and then just flack right through the tv more like

1074
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:53,560
t-ball maybe in this case k-ball t-ball i like that all right anyhow back to santa

1075
01:40:53,560 --> 01:41:03,920
do do do do do do uh let's see uh other tweets blue swim wants to know if we're if any of

1076
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:13,960
us are going to pick up the super mario all-stars we port no anybody anybody if someone gives

1078
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:30,560

1079
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:35,440

1083
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:54,680
a bummer but you know what they say all good things dot dot dot was the last episode of

1084
01:41:54,680 --> 01:42:00,360
star trek uh spazzinator also says as self-serving as it sounds and seeing that there's no official

1085
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:06,480
blog posting for it follow me on twitter for news on psn video freebies you know you should

1086
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:11,720
instead of doing it through your twitter dude get like a blog spot or a tumblr or something

1087
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:20,680
and any idiot can have a blog look at us we have a podcast just go on itunes itunes is

1088
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:26,040
living proof that any idiot can podcast you can do better than twitter spazzinator i know

1089
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:32,840
you can i believe in you do you believe in spazzinator huh yeah yeah all right yes whatever

1090
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:38,080
you just said rob no that was that was perfect that was fine funny t-man wants to uh link

1091
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:44,780
us to look i found a techno kitten rip off oh my god the clone games i guess are starting

1092
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:50,300
now there's a game on uh xbox live any marketplace that he links us to again this is funny t-man

1093
01:42:50,300 --> 01:43:00,640
on twitter called asteroids do concern me what and that's actually that was one of

1094
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:05,960
the uh indie games that they had um oh i see some of the levels are serious but there's

1095
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:10,080
like this third level here that's unicorns and pooping rainbows that's one of the ones

1096
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,900
that they showed um you know as part of the indie games push that they're doing remember

1097
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:21,620
right now um yeah it looked interesting so is there like a raver puppy odyssey game coming

1098
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:27,100
out or something or no but it can it should that would be awesome let's see i'm looking

1099
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:34,720
at the official trailer for asteroids do concern me let's see here waiting to see some gameplay

1100
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:39,800
here we go oh this looks like the same type of thing where you use the button to float

1101
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:47,620
up and down it just moves really fast and you collect orbs i have to admit this actually

1102
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:53,300
looks a little more advanced than uh techno getting adventure where's the meowing but

1103
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:59,220
i guess there's oh there's some cute little modes what's this okay double rainbow double

1104
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:09,860
rainbow course what does it mean hey rob that one's cool doodle mode no no no it's awesome

1105
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:13,300
though about that whole that game right there is part of that trailer where they're like

1106
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:18,860
yeah we're sick of the people cloning games out there and they show off the games that

1107
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:22,300
they have and the ones that they're pushing a lot of them are clones of other things but

1108
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:26,900
see here's the thing you know why you can't call asteroids do concern me a rip off because

1109
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:31,700
it's missing two very very very important things yes the gameplay is the same but here's

1110
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:37,460
the thing techno and kittens it's that's right it's missing adventure you might say it's

1111
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:44,420
missing adventure happy hardcore

1112
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:45,420
everybody rave

1113
01:44:45,420 --> 01:45:05,180
you guys let's drop some e and make out oh my gosh you guys yay let's make some candy

1114
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:11,000
i'll trade you this candy necklace for your candy wristband and then a big gust of wind

1115
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:19,140
gets caught in their jenko pants wide like james may blow off

1116
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:25,380
tiger claw 305 sends us some tweets blockbuster laughed at a netflix partnership proposal

1117
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:30,140
in 2000 isn't it always funny you get these hindsight is 2020 stories and it's kind of

1118
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:34,580
like look who's laughing now this is the story i think it is it was a part of the deal was

1119
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:41,980
that the netflix brand had to remain and blockbuster was like no if we do anything it's got to

1120
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:48,580
have the blockbuster name on it we don't think this is a viable way of delivering rentals

1121
01:45:48,580 --> 01:45:53,660
fail they thought it was a very small niche business this is just this is just some flash

1122
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:58,340
in the pan that's gonna go away tvds over the mail come on that's like groceries to

1123
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:05,620
your door this is some web van shit no no that's on the inner webs that's just college

1124
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:12,820
kids and junkies on the inner webs i hate blockbusters so much so i get like the best

1125
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:20,540
schadenfreude from anything you know why blockbuster ceo four types four types of cancer i'm like

1126
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:25,900
that's because you run blockbuster gave it to you wow that's vicious what what that's

1127
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:31,340
really horrible i'm being hyperbole why is it that um you know not all of them are corporate

1128
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:36,580
run stores by the way yeah that's can i dig into this a little more hold on why do you

1129
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:41,020
have such hatred for blockbuster they used to work for them there are certain movies

1130
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:44,220
you have a sixty dollar late fee still don't know there are certain movies that they just

1131
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:49,220
wouldn't carry like if it was a rated r movie but it was a lgbt themed movie like boys don't

1132
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:53,500
cry with hillary snake they wouldn't carry it they just had this weird sort of censorship

1133
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:57,500
like family friendly stuff it's bullshit let people rent movies what they want don't yeah

1134
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:01,900
is that the showgirls with the bras drawn on yeah they would that's the copy if they

1135
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:06,780
had a copy of showgirls at all that's the copy they would have so netflix all the way

1136
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:12,320
i don't care all right and tiger claw links us to another uh tweet uh tweet an article

1137
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:16,420
that i actually think is kind of cool it's about this mouse the shogun brothers chameleon

1138
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:21,780
x1 mouse it actually lives a double life as a controller so i guess it's like one of those

1139
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:26,180
like transformer things where it just goes one one one one one one and it can transform

1140
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:33,700
into that controller that's kind of neat 55 dollars if you want it though nice that just

1141
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:39,140
makes me think that it would get really linty and cruddy because like even if you you if

1142
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:42,620
you use a mouse a lot they get kind of gross so i don't know why you'd want buttons on

1143
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:47,660
there not my mouse my mouse smells like kittens and rainbows it's perfect i don't know what

1144
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:53,000
you're talking about and lastly a tweet from gamer girl who wants us to know la mulana

1145
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:59,580
rocks just saying you go ahead girl go ahead gamer girl with your la mulana there it is

1146
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:06,180
our tweets twitter.com slash o l r act deft wants us to know that uh netflix isn't in

1147
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:10,980
mexico he says since netflix doesn't exist here i'm still stuck with blockbuster and

1148
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:19,020
it ain't it ain't bad it ain't bad yeah yeah all right i mean are mexican blockbusters

1149
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:23,280
the same as the ones here or pretty much do they still sell like the candy up front like

1150
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:27,340
as much as you pay for at the movie theater when there'd be like a 7-eleven next door

1151
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:35,140
to get the same thing for like a sixth as much money just curious hey let's move on

1152
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:42,580
to some more stories huh let's uh so of course the npd numbers just came out for the stuff

1153
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:47,780
for november and it's a very interesting month because it is the last big month for games

1154
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:54,820
um for the year usually because december's just crap anyways so of course one of the

1155
01:48:54,820 --> 01:49:00,900
highlights of is how well did the connect do and did pretty well it actually outsold

1156
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:07,620
uh the playstation move five to one in november which is pretty impressive i'd say and um

1157
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:14,540
also of course uh microsoft didn't do too bad with xbox 360 systems they sold 1.37 million

1158
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:21,340
units in november and they said that it puts the connect uh bundle figure range around

1159
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:31,340
uh 685 000 units and uh the move console bundles around uh 130 37 000 units and it says right

1160
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:38,220
now global sales the top uh 2.5 million units and sony has reported 4.1 million playstation

1161
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:42,540
movie units have been shipped to retailers though the company hasn't disclosed actual

1162
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:49,460
sales numbers and let me be honest here um 4.1 million and 2.5 million i don't want to

1163
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:54,820
sound biased or anything but i mean you're comparing move units versus the connect connect

1164
01:49:54,820 --> 01:50:00,100
you need one the move you may need up to four i mean that's a little you know and are they

1165
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:07,220
counting the nav controller on top of that um you know it's a little wonky those numbers

1166
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:13,620
but whatever fuzzy math exactly fuzzy math that they spin to make it look like the move

1167
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:21,340
is doing better than it is and honestly the move is it's nice but the moving getting spots

1168
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:28,940
on ellen the move isn't appearing in you know tv shows that's a little worrisome i guess

1169
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:34,620
um some of the top games of course for uh november it's not a big surprise call of duty

1170
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:39,220
black ops being number one assassin's creed brotherhood number two although number three

1171
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:45,980
is kind of surprising just dance two is the top um title for november uh followed by madden

1172
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:52,380
11 fable 3 donkey kong country returns need for speed hot pursuit gran turismo 5 mba 2k11

1173
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:58,060
and we fit plus because people still buy we fit plus and of course with the connect titles

1174
01:50:58,060 --> 01:51:04,140
coming out it's um no wonder i mean you're gonna guess the best-selling title for the

1175
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:09,180
connect other than obviously connect adventures because that comes with the actual units but

1176
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:15,980
down central it was um the number 11 title um overall in sales for the month and the

1177
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:23,820
top selling connect title as a standalone skew awesome and who says uh music games are

1178
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:32,060
dead i don't know who people if harmonix is up for sale though that's uh not necessarily

1179
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:39,460
um a good sign but maybe this will help buy it for two dollars stop all right uh the debt

1180
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:46,300
though they can keep the debt apparently uh yeah there's some i've got a story and believe

1181
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:50,300
it or not guys pay attention because it involves video games it involves pornography you ready

1182
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:55,700
it has to do with nintendo porn uh apparently there's a website i've never heard of this

1183
01:51:55,700 --> 01:52:01,560
video game porn uh it received a notice from sy valence which is a company i guess it was

1184
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:06,640
hired by nintendo uh saying that this site has been committing trademark violation because

1185
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:11,700
they use the name nintendo to describe an image of a scantily clad woman who holds a

1186
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:18,740
nintendo ds so it's like chick with boobies out plays nintendo ds and now nintendo is

1208
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:23,980
i'm i'm using the dsi to take a picture of my panties you see that that's one picture

1209
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:27,860
and then in another she's she's using the dsi she's holding it up to her face and she's

1210
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:33,300
like oh maybe i'll take an artful picture with my dsi and then the last picture she's

1211
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:41,160
just fingering her pussy and there's no dsi whatsoever it's just hey i decided to put

1212
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:51,860
it away guess where i put it i found a new toy my yeah my mind the jokes right now please

1213
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:57,860
by all means that you're gonna ruin your stylus you have to get another one you try what's

1214
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:03,720
that's why she has an xl her belly button has very awkward placement doesn't her belly

1215
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:08,180
button kind of look like really left of center like doesn't that kind of like look like a

1216
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:14,340
gunshot that is where the stylus is right now i don't know it's perspective rob either

1217
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:20,220
that or bad photoshopping you're trying to play scribble knots and you can't draw you're

1218
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:24,580
like what is wrong with this stylus it's all gross what happens if you put horror in scribble

1219
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:29,700
knots does it just not know does it just go all right dark soccer you have some other

1220
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:35,960
news for us unfortunately it probably won't involve boobies no but it involves amazon

1221
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:43,460
so and amazon's have one boob i guess anyway um now i just it's already been going on here

1222
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:50,380
but now um amazon uk is going to be paying for old games and trade-in you can uh print

1223
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:58,460
up a prepaid delivery label for your box and sorry i was thinking of the last story and

1224
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:04,580
for example if you send in medal of honor you'll get a 23 pound uh gift card credited

1225
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:11,460
to your account that's a heavy gift card i see how's british money joke i like that okay

1226
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:18,020
then i'll change it for just dance too you get 15 quid how's that for assassins creed

1227
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:25,460
brotherhood 28 quid so now you can't make a joke about that well we could it probably

1228
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:30,660
just wouldn't be funny but i think it's like up to three and uh if your game's broken they're

1229
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:37,060
gonna send it back and uh they'll basically just send you a confirmation say you can have

1230
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:43,020
the money or you can't and then they'll send it back in two weeks a faulty really faulty

1231
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:47,700
stuff may be just thrown away so i guess maybe it's a free way of getting rid of shit you

1232
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:54,620
might get stuff back but it's supposed to be again three a month there's an ad on that

1233
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:58,780
page you're reading from this as insert coin and i can't help but thinking that's what

1234
01:56:58,780 --> 01:57:03,300
the girl is trying to do in the picture i was looking at the one that said in soviet

1235
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:08,400
russia games make you stronger uh i i can't get off of uh boobs uh and apparently neither

1243
01:57:55,500 --> 01:58:00,800
not on my algebra final solar flare in our charm says i thought nintendo already knew

1244
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:05,400
about their products in porn they sell the rubbers for their wiimotes oh we condom joke

1245
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:12,740
i like that you know what olr needs we need a contest vibrator best slash fiction involving

1246
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:18,580
nintendo characters and it should just be as absurd as possible do you think there's

1247
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:27,220
some good mario i've read absurd uh absurd fan fiction although i don't think it was

1248
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:33,100
really nintendo related but it's actually i have in the past found metroid fan fiction

1249
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:38,620
let's see i typed mario peach slash into google and i got this website that came up oh it's

02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:43,140
his job you know making tons of money got his start in high school making mario porn

1261
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:48,740
why didn't nintendo send a cease and desist to that that's my question that's tasteful

1262
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:53,340
because they're calling up legal and they're like they hang up the phone they're like this

1263
02:00:53,340 --> 02:01:03,660

1264
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:13,900
all right ramen our term says mario you are not the father all right let's move on please

1265
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:20,860
quick loki we need a new story quick something that doesn't involve boobs and mario labor

1266
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:31,260
okay um so apparently there's this comment going around um from ea games president frank

1267
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:38,100
uh gabow he believes that the future of the game industry will come um from multiplayer

1268
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:43,380
games says that we're uh ea is very comfortable moving the discussion towards how we make

1269
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:49,980
connected gameplay be it cooperative or multiplayer or online services as opposed to um fire forget

1270
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:57,500
packaged goods only single player 25 hours and you're out he says um i think the model

1271
02:01:57,500 --> 02:02:03,700
is finished yeah finished for them basically to translate this in layman's peak he believes

1272
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:10,660
that games should have more of an online component which they charge money for and also more

1273
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:16,140
download content later on so that it extends the gameplay beyond 25 hours which they charge

1274
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:22,420
money for and um you know possibly some sort of massive multiplayer online service which

1275
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:27,460
they would also change more anymore so basically he wants to charge more money for stuff well

1276
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:32,820
i mean i hate to say it but isn't there kind of maybe a hint of truth to this like because

1277
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:38,420
you know i think about okay well uh facebook games are a part of where gaming seems to

1278
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:42,900
be going at least is the next big thing and most of that is multiplayer certainly there's

1279
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:46,900
lots of money to be made in mmos heck most of the single player games that are out these

1280
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:52,580
days even final fantasy 13 was there download content that ever came out on playstation

1281
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:57,220
3 for it i think it was rumored but besides that the trophies and the achievements kind

1282
02:02:57,220 --> 02:03:03,180
of add to this more cohesive multiplayer experience on xbox live and playstation network granted

1283
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:08,700
not every gamer is connected on their system and some people are quite content playing

1284
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:16,500
the games by themselves but even people that don't know how to get their um xboxes online

1285
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:22,500
and stuff have probably at least played bejeweled blitz once in their life right yeah i just

1286
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:26,140
think that i've never played it you know this is kind of an excuse to say oh well we don't

1287
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:29,780
need to worry too much about the single player experience because people are just gonna play

1288
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:33,740
the multiplayer experience and you haven't played bejeweled blitz but you played knights

1289
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:40,460
of the clicky it's even worse yeah which by the way i know i'm a little early but f you

1290
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:44,420
to knights of the clicky because it just deleted like three of my friends the other day just

1291
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:49,500
like oh really like two of them are friends of mine i talk to every day did you send had

1292
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:53,340
to send a re-invite or something i didn't try that yet i was hoping it would fix itself

1293
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:56,980
it will if they do you know if they removed the game like deleted the game from their

1294
02:03:56,980 --> 02:04:01,060
own profile like they've had enough they're getting intervention maybe i don't know one

1295
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:05,380
of them was xlink so xlink did you delete the game what'd you do i don't know yeah he's

1296
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:09,220
still on mine so that shouldn't happen no see i think he probably just deleted me from

1297
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:13,740
his friends list he's like i'm sick of all these vlogs and uh keyboard cat videos i'm

1298
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:15,860
just deleting rob for my friends list that's probably what really happened

1299
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:22,940
anyhow now we'll get a phone call later for sure oh rob we still love you all right you

1300
02:04:22,940 --> 02:04:28,780
better uh here's another uh speaking of multiplayer places where multiplayer things are happening

1301
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:33,860
you know this is the future low-key playstation home i mean surely this is what the guy from

1302
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:38,060
ea was talking about right was playstation home was where the multiplayer is at can you

1303
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:41,740
believe playstation home has been out for two years that's right a sony press release

1304
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:46,660
came out this week celebrating the second birthday of playstation home over 17 million

1305
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:52,200
users have visited home uh for two minutes and then they and then they left right they

1306
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:57,780
have participated in over 600 community events so what that means obviously is collectively

1307
02:04:57,780 --> 02:05:05,400
those 17 million users played 600 community events um let's see uh some of them were sponsored

1308
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:09,580
by game developers and so on some of them were more unofficial sodium 2 is coming out

1309
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:17,840
next spring oh goody and conspiracy a multiplayer spy puzzle game from jet set games is coming

1310
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:24,580
out as well i just want to know when the furry sex lounge is coming out because that's let's

1311
02:05:24,580 --> 02:05:30,180
just call it what it is i mean why are we wasting our time hello by the way i tried

1312
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:37,380
to do the ddr thing couldn't do it home is the future now it's time for some of you to

1313

1317
02:05:55,420 --> 02:06:04,500
mailbag at orange lounge radio.com this was the email that was uh um referred to earlier

1318
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:11,100
hey sky and dark sakura sorry loki i don't know if you're able to purchase the wild games

1319
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:15,340
at the moment at this at the awesome sale prices yet i didn't see any sale prices by

1320
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:21,140
the way i think it's done it'll be back it'll be back but here is an alternative it sounds

1321
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:25,720
like jamie had a wow account in the past so if rob sends her skull of resurrection via

1322
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:31,020
blizzard's website then he gets a free month when a month of paid game time is applied

1323
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:35,860
to jamie's account including a 10-day non-restricted free trial rob can simply buy jamie a month

1324
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:40,820
of a game as a present no games or expansions will have to be purchased and play for 40

1325
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:45,660
days and try out the new old world content just an idea from horde house podcast number

1326
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:52,760
one fan flaco jones flaco jones but that's okay uh yeah i think it's a great idea i can't

1327
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:55,500
believe i didn't even think of the scroll of resurrection but that's a great idea the

1328
02:06:55,500 --> 02:07:00,860
thing is i when was the last time it played if it was more than two months ago i think

1329
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:04,940
you're eligible okay which i mean you you're more than six months out aren't you no i think

1330
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:09,540
i'm actually a year out because i got star trek online didn't i get it last christmas

1331
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:14,500
i don't know no i didn't i got it so yeah i think star trek online came out like february

1332
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:18,420
i think the beta test is going on yeah yeah yeah so i've been playing star trek online

1333
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:22,280
since it was in beta that was star trek online was in beta around the time you and i started

1334
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:29,060
dating right yeah so i think it was last christmas so yeah so i so i've been and i quit world

1335
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:33,260
of warcraft to play star trek online uh yeah i could get you like a 60-day card and then

1336
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:36,620
you'd have your two months right there and yeah it'll be like a little present and then

1337
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:41,900
i get a free month out of it so hi and that means that i don't have to actually quit and

1338
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:44,820
you can still experience the new content you'll be able to play you said you had through burning

1339
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:49,540
crusade you'll be burning crusades the only thing you can't do is play a worgen so you

1340
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:52,740
won't and to be honest i'm not i don't really give a shit about worgen so you'll be able

1341
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:56,100
to play to level 70 which is a long time i'm gonna play a goat chick again draenei are

1342
02:07:56,100 --> 02:07:59,900
awesome the draenei were cool they're really cool i think they're they are probably the

1343
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:04,860
most underrated class in wow next it was my favorite yeah except that you know my whole

1344
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:10,020
okay here's what the problem i ran into was when i hit level 20 i was like what the fuck

1345
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:17,260
do i do now i'm on i'm off the island i'm on this place on a boat i'm on a boat in fact

1346
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:21,240
i think i remember actually standing out and shouting i'm on a boat but i don't know what

1347
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:26,740
to do now i don't know where anyone is i don't know what anyone's doing and the only issue

1348
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:31,860
you would have is that the draenei and the blood elf starting areas were the only areas

1349
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:36,660
that weren't changed with this new expansion so it's still on the same quests and everything

1350
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:41,920
but i have a level 20 draenei already oh i guess that's true what she would still definitely

1351
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:47,340
benefit from is the new hero bulletin board in any capital city there's a bulletin board

1352
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:50,920
where you right click it and it says and it'll look at what level you are and it's like we

1353
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:55,980
could really use your help in redridge mountains because you're level 25 and it's like oh and

1354
02:08:55,980 --> 02:09:00,380
then it'll give you a breadcrumb quest to go talk to someone in x own that's that's

1355
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:03,700
new and that's awesome i kind of dig that i mean this is one of the things that i like

1356
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:09,060
to i really really like about star trek online is that first of all i can play i've completely

1357
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:13,100
except for like playing a few things with some of my fleet friends i've done all of

1358
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:19,400
my leveling myself i've done all my missions myself and i like the missions because it's

1359
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:25,940
like okay well you do this oh no this leads to this thing and it's all in the same area

1360
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:30,460
you know like one of my favorite my favorite mission that i've done to date is the uh the

1361
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:37,380
one that i said was like silent hill where it's the stupid most stupid uh next generation

1362
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:42,100
uh bad guys was the davidians the ones that were the psychic leeches that were just slightly

1363
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:47,300
out of phase with reality these blue glowing creatures and they figured a way back in you

1364
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:50,260
have to go in the past you have to go in the present but when but they've screwed up the

1365
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:55,860
electronics in this old station to where this hologram that's trapped there is psycho and

1366
02:09:55,860 --> 02:09:59,940
trying to kill you and it's like calling out creepy stuff it's very silent hill and all

1367
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:04,140
you have is your flashlight and everything and you know that was my favorite but you

1368
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:09,020
know you get to this one point and then you hear the voice and and another thing happens

1369
02:10:09,020 --> 02:10:11,660
and that's why i like this something that builds and builds and builds on top of each

1370
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:15,460
other which is what i wasn't really getting out of world of warcraft before well it's

1371
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:21,100
settled i'm gonna get dark soccer a 60-day wow card as a chris mccay gift and uh then

1372
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:24,100
it's a win-win situation because i won't have to hear as much star trek nerd chat on this

1373
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:31,740
show hearts but i was using it as a basis of comparison i give you shit because that's

1374
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:35,820
what i've been doing for the past nine years i know but but my point is is that that's

1375
02:10:35,820 --> 02:10:39,060
the type of missions i like and if there's stuff like that now in world of warcraft because

1376
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:43,980
honestly there really wasn't there was it was like okay will you take your deer and

1377
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:49,780
skin their corpses yeah that was really it i'm like but only one in every six deer has

1378
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:56,720
a skin apparently yeah which they they fix that yeah whereas if i have a scanning mission

1379
02:10:56,720 --> 02:11:02,920
it's beam to the planet scan five of these items you're done and you run up to the items

1380
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:09,660
and you just scan them and that's it and i call those my free xp ones that oh look at

1381
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:14,980
the pretty textures you know things rama is starting the you sold out chance uh tiger

1382
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:20,700
claw says it's an excuse to get dark soccer on horde house and uh death wishing says crack

1383
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:27,020
rob's buying soccer a crack to get a free hit a crack and again keep in mind there's

1384
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:34,680
no guarantee i'll stick with it again because i am on star trek online i'm in a fleet i

1385
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:39,160
play with scottish men who i love playing with my scottish dudes yes but if you come

an exclusive preview screening i'm going to pull up the article in a second it might be

1399
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:55,100
worth bringing the issues raised to a wider global audience although i'm sure like me

1400
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:59,780
your stance on this and the implications such issues place on personal responsibility will

1433
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:41,300
out story i'm not going to go into it and i completely misunderstood what my friend

1434
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:47,640
said okay one of my friends on facebook was feeling angry because someone verbally belittled

1435
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:50,920
her for what she was wearing to an event and she said she was thinking well at least i

1436
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:58,260
have children and you don't now i thought it was because you know i've been trying i

1437
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:02,620
thought it was okay is that all the value a woman has what the hell kind of response

1438
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:07,620
is that too like i have children and you don't like she went back and explained it to me

1439
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:12,700
that it's i have to pay for my children you don't have to pay for your for any children

1440
02:17:12,700 --> 02:17:18,860
i have expenses that you don't i have responsibilities that you don't that's what she meant i didn't

1441
02:17:18,860 --> 02:17:28,140
see it that way because i've been a little bitter um damn you uris um but uh one of her

1442
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:33,580
friends has like started going in three all caps locked posts by the way about i've adopted

1443
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:38,000
all these children and i've had the court waive my costs and everything and i was like

1444
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,320
dude like don't what are you doing adopting children if you can't freaking afford them

1445
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:47,100
that's almost as bad i mean i i guess you're trying to do something good but you know and

1446
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:53,580
my response to her was i don't care you're not my friend this the person who made the

1447
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:58,820
first post she's my friend you are not this isn't about you and so when i went to check

1448
02:17:58,820 --> 02:18:03,660
on it an hour later all of those posts were deleted facebook serious business but i'm

1449
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:10,100
saying i'm saying it's just like that's that's leading up to this fu nobody needs to know

1450
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:17,540
your personal shit we don't care if you're not our friend we don't care saying all this

1451
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:22,740
stuff to make yourself be all holier than thou just makes you look bitchier than thou

1452

1457
02:18:53,060 --> 02:18:58,100

1458
02:18:58,100 --> 02:19:04,620
so i have i've had slow internet but uh i'd rather have fast internet i also bought a

1459
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:11,740
docsis 3 modem now so it should be even faster when i do get it working that's it um i don't

1460
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:18,300
have a whole lot actually my fus are um pretty you know just just fu to um not having enough

1461
02:19:18,300 --> 02:19:21,780
money to take any extravagant holiday trips because i'm gonna have an entire week off

1462
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:27,700
of work this year just due to situations and and you know uh just me having extra pto in

1463
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:31,380
them encouraging me to take it basically uh so i'm gonna have a whole week off and nowhere

1464
02:19:31,380 --> 02:19:35,700
to go so f you that fact i mean there might be other things going on that will definitely

1465
02:19:35,700 --> 02:19:42,420
take my time but uh fu to getting old and not having trips to take slices pop do you

1466
02:19:42,420 --> 02:19:50,020
have any fus fus to buying something digitally and then not having it post to your banking

1467
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:55,060
until like seven days later and kind of scurrying up the mental math of how much money you thought

1468
02:19:55,060 --> 02:19:59,900
you had when you're on employment on a fixed budget and you expect something that you buy

1469
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:08,380
to just show up the next day and um also a fu to just playing a new type of social game

1470
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:15,740
and just be nervous about being inexperienced all right how about our kdm 42 do you have

1471
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:22,420
any fus f you to dry air and winter and how that makes my skin get all itchy and crappy

1472
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:29,220
and it's always sucky and uh fu to being behind on everything just doesn't work all that stuff

1473
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:36,460
all right f you to the winner i don't know if winter can be okay sometimes but yeah i

1474
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:42,060
don't like i don't i don't like the changes my body goes through either all right loki

1475
02:20:42,060 --> 02:20:45,500
and myself have one more story apiece for you guys then we're gonna get to the skype

1476
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:51,540
line at 1877 game olr but first a couple quick stories for you guys uh what we were alluding

1477
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:57,300
to earlier when we were talking to bobby and also uh i think we may have made this joke

1478
02:20:57,300 --> 02:21:03,820
during the show uh apparently a cyprus hill backup singer is suing rock star take two

1479
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:13,900
over grand theft auto san andreas yes that's right um apparently um back in the day i guess

1480
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:21,580
michael shag washington um he i guess spoke with the developer and stuff um about his

1481
02:21:21,580 --> 02:21:29,060
troubled youth it says um he claims that he met with rockstar 2003 to talk to them about

1482
02:21:29,060 --> 02:21:34,020
his street life for their upcoming game including the description of his troubled youth and

1483
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:42,140
specifics of how the teenager teenagers in his gang rode around on bicycles um apparently

1484
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:49,020
he's saying um you know he didn't even know that i guess he's never seen san andreas in

1485
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:53,880
action until july when his nephew is playing it this is the plaintiff had never seen the

1486
02:21:53,880 --> 02:22:01,040
game or had never seen the game he did not um own or play video games uh the complaint

1487
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:06,660
admits of further explaining upon examination of the images of cj in comparison with his

1488
02:22:06,660 --> 02:22:11,020
photo from that year and other evidence became clear that rockstar had stolen his image and

1489
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:17,380
never paid him so now he's claiming um he was asking for 25 of the profits from san

1490
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:24,620
andreas which were approximately 20 or 250 million dollars so you know 75 million dollars

1491
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:28,900
of that i guess and take two of course is saying that the case is completely without

1492
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:35,460
merit now part of me goes like crazy guy is very crazy and i think we can all agree this

1493
02:22:35,460 --> 02:22:40,780
can't be based on his real life if this was his real life having sex with hookers and

1494
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:44,860
then shooting him in the face i mean he'd be in je he'd be dead from the state that

1495
02:22:44,860 --> 02:22:49,460
they would have executed him years ago you know i'm sorry but he wasn't the only person

1496
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:55,940
i'm sure that was in a gang that rode around on a bicycle i mean come on but and i don't

1497
02:22:55,940 --> 02:23:01,180
think you know and i like how he says oh well the character looked like me well the character

1498
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:04,900
can look like whatever you want because you can customize your character in the game is

1499
02:23:04,900 --> 02:23:09,500
here here's the other interesting thing is that i mean he claims that you know he filed

1500
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:15,760
the lawsuit and so he must this this meeting he had with rockstar must not be fake like

1501
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:19,420
that must have actually happened right because otherwise he'd be really stupid to file a

1502
02:23:19,420 --> 02:23:23,860
lawsuit and that can easily be disproved that rockstar never met with him but i wonder like

1503
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:29,140
maybe rockstar met with a bunch of people and this is just like it's called doing research

1504
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:35,300
yeah you know you do research surely he should have signed something way back then during

1505
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:40,300
that initial meeting that was like you know this is just for informative purposes and

1506
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:46,060
you you're not compensated beyond maybe xyz or your song being in the game or a special

1507
02:23:46,060 --> 02:23:50,900
thank you credit or something like that it's just yeah pretty much this seems kind of excessive

1508
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:55,980
it does and it's also like too too late isn't there like a statute of limitations i guess

1509
02:23:55,980 --> 02:24:01,300
not but probably not tiger claw in our chat room says if the game is based on his life

1510
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:04,940
then so is the hot coffee if you know what i mean i don't think it's based on his life

1511
02:24:04,940 --> 02:24:09,900
at all i mean it doesn't sound like this meeting was in great detail it's fiction it was based

1512
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:18,440
on no one's life it's like it's like when a person is going to play a wrestler in a

1513
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:23,800
movie so that person hangs out with other wrestlers to kind of know what a wrestler's

1514
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:30,760
life is like that doesn't mean that you model your character directly after somebody right

1515
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:35,720
don't they do this shit don't actors do this shit all the time with movies right method

1516
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:40,760
acting that's yeah i wouldn't think it's that much different anyhow one more story for you

1517
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:46,680
guys and it has to do with something we reported on previously an 8-bit remake of dj hero that

1518
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:52,220
was out there on the internet it has been taken down from the official website why because

1519
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:56,460
of a cease and desist letter from universal music publishing group there was a little

1520
02:24:56,460 --> 02:25:02,600
bit of back and forth going between the creator eric ruth and the universal music publishing

1521
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:07,000
group and you can read the whole exchange over at what picky picky mall dot com blog

1522
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:12,400
dot it's picky geek whatever this is and the whole little exchange really strikes me as

1523
02:25:12,400 --> 02:25:18,160
like kind of unprofessional and i don't see any signatures in it and so it's i don't know

1524
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:24,040
like i read this and i go part of it reads like fanfic to me but whatever um for whatever

1525
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:28,800
reason the game is now gone i mean but you know what they say once it hits the internet

1526
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:32,920
it's always on the internet so it's not like you can't can't find this thing on torrent

1527
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:37,240
sites and so forth and honestly the news about it getting taken down probably just makes

1528
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:41,940
more people want to download it because ha i have the file i'm not supposed to have it's

1529
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:46,880
just it's just like why wikileaks is such a big deal but not to get on another tangent

1530
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:50,600
but people just like to have shit they're not supposed to have that's what it is it's

1531
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:56,680
e-peen anyhow another interesting twist in the story and dark tetsuya had mentioned this

1532
02:25:56,680 --> 02:26:03,400
in our mod forum and uh sure enough it's either a heck of a coincidence uh eric ruth is the

1533
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:10,240
real name of an artist that used to do bimani related things named dj potato with an e and

1534
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:14,640
i can't remember if we ever had him on this show i don't think we did but i remember we

1535
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:20,280
banned one of his songs from the old station because it was so so terrible and you'll just

1536
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:23,160
have to google it if you want to find out about that but it's kind of funny that now

1537
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:28,680
and i where are they now bimani people five years later that's the same eric ruth though

1538
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:34,300
i know i'm thinking it's kind of a common name but then i go well games but i don't

1539
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:40,140
know does dark tetsuya did dark tetsuya have something else to to show that or is that

1540
02:26:40,140 --> 02:26:45,800
just a coinky dink do i need to email dj potato and be all like is this you is this you bra

1541
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:50,400
is this you we'll see so i'll have to see if there's anything else that comes out on

1542
02:26:50,400 --> 02:26:55,640
that but otherwise uh kind of interesting where are they now bimani people oh loki dark

1543
02:26:55,640 --> 02:27:00,920
sakura and sky are still doing that little podcast they started years ago and we had

1544
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:04,720
iguana girl on here a few weeks ago i know we've been talking about episode 400 we're

1545
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:08,680
gonna get a whole lot of the uh old people together that would be fun by the way that's

1546
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:17,520
only seven weeks away we might want to start planning that all right that's it for the

1547
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:24,000
news we're done let's go to the skype line 1877 game olr or our username on skype is

1548
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:30,720
orange lounge radio all one word uh 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge

1549
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:37,940
radio the skype line is now open for business and dark tetsuya says dark tetsuya says it

1550
02:27:37,940 --> 02:27:43,640
was in the read me it says dj potato with an e in the read me file so it is the same

1551
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:51,160
guy yeah all right that's proof enough to me interesting all right maybe we should like

1552
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:54,840
get him on the show i don't know but then i'm worried the topic of like old songs will

1553
02:27:54,840 --> 02:28:00,880
come up and then it'll get really awkward all right solar flare we're not doing a marathon

radio we have a call coming in right now hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this

1556
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:13,440
is x link hi x link what's on your mind buddy you should know me i'm your friend from facebook

1557
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:18,960
that didn't befriend you i well apparently you somehow have left my circle of knights

1558
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:23,700
of the clicky friends so i don't know what happened it's probably because i've been inactive

1559
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:28,000
because of a certain other clicky game that we're all too familiar with because we're

1560
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:34,480
also all in another guild called wow i see so when wow when kata came out i kind of like

1561
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:38,800
totally abandoned all my facebook games for a while so but i'm pretty sure i have people

1562
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:43,700
on my facebook who haven't played that game but the first time they ever played it like

1563
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:48,400
did marissa ever play past one day i doubt she did i don't know i don't know if she's

1564
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:52,040
listening you have to tell me marissa if you ever kept up nights of the clicky well for

1565
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:56,520
whatever reason i just thought maybe you didn't want to be my friend anymore on nights of

1566
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:01,440
the clicky but maybe you just didn't want to click on my chest anymore to help me store

1567
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:07,760
more gold and no no no i do i seriously do is just there's a lot going on and i really

1568
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:14,440
prefer us getting all the little guilds perks and stuff so we can get our 50 or 60 bonuses

1569
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:18,160
when we start killing stuff then you know play nights of the clicky and getting you

1570
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:23,480
a broadsword all right so i have to ask how's warcraft cataclysm going for you since it

1571
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:28,200
was the big game released this week well it's going good since it got me addicted to it

1572
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:33,840
um it was fine i i went out and i ran to the you know i was one i always wanted to be in

1573
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:38,040
one of those lines during the midnight launching of something so i decided to go see how it

1574
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:44,160
was it was very interesting um and it was very intriguing to see the all the people

1575
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:49,200
qqing and cussing i can't get in what the fuck and you know and well what the hell's

1576
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:54,440
going on and it was just funny hearing the people bitch and moan for like the first like

1577
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:58,480
four or five hours of trying to get into the game and they can't get in and try and become

1578
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:03,840
the first of different it was over in like 10 minutes we ran black rock caverns before

1579
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:10,860
1am but we were prepared to go you know i mean there was a group of like five of us

1580
02:30:10,860 --> 02:30:13,880
that we had emailed earlier in the day and it was like okay we're gonna be outside the

1581
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:19,920
understood the dungeon at 11 59 p.m and then you're you're the one who you're the one on

1582
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:23,760
your other podcast that went off and saying talking about how i told you guys that you

1583
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:27,120
had to log out and you guys you didn't really believe me at first and i'm like yeah there

1584
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:31,280
was a blue post that's specifically stated if you're in game by time that thing rolled

1585
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:37,160
around that you have to uh actually log out and then re-log back in i i you're right i

1586
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:40,160
didn't believe you it's not because i don't like you it's just one of those things where

1587
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:44,420
i thought like i thought that blizzard had set this whole thing up so it was supposed

1588
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:49,560
to be a seamless transition i thought it was going to be like magic i didn't think the

1589
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:52,120
servers were going to boot us or anything so it just seemed really weird to me that

1590
02:30:52,120 --> 02:30:56,000
all of a sudden it was like now you gotta reboot and it didn't say anything like it's

1591
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:04,000
like it's the cable company yeah well so anyway yeah but it whatever i mean yeah it was 10

1592
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:08,000
minutes of nerd rage but then it was over and we were doing our quest it was fine but

1593
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:13,000
then you guys were doing your dungeons while i'm doing the uh the uh the new profession

1594
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:18,900
so how is archaeology that's something i haven't touched yet is a loads of fun but it's very

1595
02:31:18,900 --> 02:31:23,960
tedious and time consuming it'd be it's because you jump from place to place to place and

1596
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:28,360
they're all random so you could go halfway to the bottom of the continent and then have

1597
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:34,040
to fly all the way up to the top for another big site so it can take a little bit but um

1598
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:39,200
there's supposedly there's going to be mounts and other items and pets i got like two pets

1599
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:45,400
so far i didn't get any amounts as of yet um but uh there's like little uh uh trinkets

1600
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:51,800
that does like um uh one was like it would like show the the dwarves dancing which which

1601
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:57,880
our guild got the scene so um it there's a lot of odds and ends to it it's it's very

1602
02:31:57,880 --> 02:32:01,520
perfect they're supposed to add stuff to it which i would wait to see him and suppose

1603
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:06,160
to add some war to the game so it'll be very interesting to see how that transaction plays

1604
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:09,520
out all right we'll see what happens anything else you want to share with listeners tonight

02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:55,120
tired because i rode 60 miles on my bike uh wait why'd you ride 16 miles on your bike

legs all right that's fine all right well good luck with the bike riding well what's

1628
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:17,840
on your mind tonight what the hell is up with this grand prison like i'm was at my friend's

1629
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:24,280
house i'm playing it and i realized 200 cars is ungodly beautiful you can take pictures

1630
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:29,560
of them it's almost like that's all the games good for is taking pictures of cars and like

1631
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:33,720
wanking but i know it's like i'm going through 200 cars lists and like wow these are beautiful

1632
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:38,320
all of a sudden i get to one car and it looks like playstation one it's like they made this

1633
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:45,680
great game and so the game is like a burger and then the bacon that's supposed to be wrapped

1634
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:52,640
around it is like three weeks old interesting analogy um do you think maybe possibly i know

1635
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:57,800
i know this might be hard to believe but do you think maybe a game company rushed the

1636
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:02,680
game to get it out at a certain time i mean i know we like didn't just have a story on

1637
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:09,440
that earlier in the evening but do you think maybe they rushed this car and just made it

1638
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:14,240
out of you know triangles and basic shapes to get it in there i think they just got fed

1639
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:18,480
up with all these like oh you have to push it back oh we got to push it back we uh messed

1640
02:35:18,480 --> 02:35:23,080
up on a tire thing our developer he's a neat freak and he keeps on trying to make the cars

1641
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:25,880
look beautiful then soon they're just like fuck it we'll make it so you can drive a go

1642
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:29,820
kart and backwards and win a race you know what would be awesome is that if gran turismo

1643
02:35:29,820 --> 02:35:33,920
had like more of a sense of humor and they put some funny cars in the game like uh for

1644
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:37,840
instance like how about an old covered wagon with oxen could actually be one of the cars

1645
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:42,320
like you have a you have a river that you're trying to uh ford to get across that could

1646
02:35:42,320 --> 02:35:46,880
be like an awesome car that was like one of those like little like barbie jeeps yes a

1647
02:35:46,880 --> 02:35:51,240
barbie jeep or a flintstone car where the guys are running to get it i remember one

1648
02:35:51,240 --> 02:35:55,240
of the old need for speed games had a bunch of different codes you could put into races

1649
02:35:55,240 --> 02:35:58,800
different things and then one of the things that they had like a lot of them were background

1650
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:04,760
objects like you could race as a log you could race as a t-rex statue we used to have log

1651
02:36:04,760 --> 02:36:10,360
races all the time it was awesome or a log with the t-rex chasing after you and like

1652
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:15,480
like meter made cars and all sorts of crazy shit or where you can race as the horse and

1653
02:36:15,480 --> 02:36:19,280
daytona wait i have a question when you would do the log races would you actually all sing

1654
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:40,840
this song i'm not tired how could this song not wake you up i'm gonna put this on my alarm

1655
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:54,600
clock wait here's my favorite part

1656
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:58,360
there was an old ass male client like back in the days before outlook i'm gonna look

1657
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:01,200
at salacious pop because i know only he's gonna understand this there's an old male

1658
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:05,440
client back before there was outlook called eudora that you could use and whenever you

1659
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:10,440
got new mail the new mail sound was do do do do do do and it was the log theme and every

1660
02:37:10,440 --> 02:37:14,440
time i got a new email i would just start singing what rolls downstairs hops over in

1661
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:20,800
pairs runs over your neighbors dog it's very fun all right the only the only good kick

1662
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:25,800
song is that you are a pirate song i don't know that you are a pirate song yes you do

1663
02:37:25,800 --> 02:37:30,400
the one that was a little do what you want because the pirate is free do what you want

1664
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:34,720
because a pirate is free you are a pirate and it had the little dancing part in the

1665
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:42,360
middle that girl was like a 4chan loli icon just saying i think this is the song i should

1697
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:27,160

1698
02:41:27,160 --> 02:41:32,200
christmas you are like the best girlfriend ever that is we both of us have never had

1699
02:41:32,200 --> 02:41:40,880
one uh-huh so and he's like really into like old uh um stuff like that and uh i just wanted

1700
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:46,200
to ask you guys what kind of game should i get because i really don't know okay like

1701
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:51,240
every great arc no that's why every great 80s arcade game was had a version on the commodore

1702
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:56,020
64 it's like anything you can think of even if it was like nintendo or sega like uh donkey

1703
02:41:56,020 --> 02:42:02,120
kong had a version uh on commodore 64 if you can find uh this game it was uh an awesome

1704
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:06,840
commodore 64 game called the great giana sisters it was like a mario brothers ripoff and it

1705
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:10,880
was so bad they actually had to take it off store shelves but you could probably find

1706
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:15,140
it like on websites you know of shadier means and burn them to a five a five and a quarter

1707
02:42:15,140 --> 02:42:20,440
floppy these days uh great giana sisters is awesome okay how are you gonna put in a floppy

1708
02:42:20,440 --> 02:42:28,720
when there's no floppy drives actually i found floppy disks i found i'm gonna go to the best

1709
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:34,240
one hey do you got five and a quarter floppy disks i could buy will you please let me finish

1710
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:43,960
sorry thrift stores aha smart lady shops yeah or uh auctions like if there's like flea markets

1711
02:42:43,960 --> 02:42:49,160
and auctions a lot of times you can find old stuff there uh you might even be i don't know

1712
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:54,120
if you would actually find commodore 64 games those are really hard to find now however

1713
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:58,440
never do business on ebay with trader dan because he will rip you the fuck off keep

1714
02:42:58,440 --> 02:43:02,600
in mind there's still making with that there's still a lot of commodore 64 community out

1715
02:43:02,600 --> 02:43:07,640
there uh you might even be able to find like a cartridge that has like a usb thing in the

1716
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:11,440
back like i don't even know like how these things there's got to be ways that you can

1717
02:43:11,440 --> 02:43:15,480
get because i know there's a huge modding community out there uh so yeah i guess loki

1718
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:18,760
makes a good point as far as like actually getting the game on a five and a quarter floppy

1719
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:23,440
might be kind of difficult now but i know it i know with the extensive community it's

1720
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:27,120
out there there's got to be something there's got to be uh the last ninja by the way is

1721
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:32,800
also a great game also what was that the last ninja okay also another awesome game is delta

1722
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:38,920
patrol it's got a really awesome soundtrack it's like 20 minutes plus uh any game that

1723
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:45,780
was by a company called epics epyx was pretty epic uh they made games like jumpman jr which

1724
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:50,600
was awesome and summer olympics and winter olympics they were like some of the best games

1725
02:43:50,600 --> 02:43:56,580
was by epics so you gotta check that out and honestly just do just do some google searches

1726
02:43:56,580 --> 02:44:02,780
like do like best commodore 64 roms and even though you'll get to like some shady websites

1727
02:44:02,780 --> 02:44:06,600
they'll have some pretty good suggestions you know there's a huge retro community for

1728
