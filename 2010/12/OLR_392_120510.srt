00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,600
Tonight, December 5th, 2010, video evidence shows the PSP phone may be the real deal.

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,920
PETA parodies Super Meat Boy to a strong response, and the video game song finally gets nominated

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,280
for a Grammy.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,440
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
Radio.

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,720
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:47,880
We are live on this December 5th of 2010 at www.allgames.com for the 392nd episode of

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
our show.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
That's a lot of shows.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Alright, my name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,780
I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games with my awesome

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,080
co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,080
I have a little dreidel.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Is it made out of clay?

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
I don't know.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
Yes.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Alright.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
No, mine was wood.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
Happy Hanukkah, Ms. Summers.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
Thank you.

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
How long have you been celebrating Hanukkah?

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,720
Did you do anything besides light some fire?

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,840
I went to Temple and Dan went with me.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
Oh, wow.

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Okay.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Yeah, and we had lots of fire.

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Nice.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,780
Everyone brought their hanukiah, which is the hanukkah menorah.

29
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,880
And we lit candles on fire.

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Good times.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
It was gorgeous and very warm.

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Well, is there any rock band?

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Because I know you're, and for those that are new to OLR, Dark Sakura went through the

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,000
whole Judaism conversion, what about a year ago you probably started this?

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Maybe a year and a half?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I started it in last July.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,200
Okay, so it's been a little while.

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,160
But I know like now she has a lot of new friends through the Jew school, basically is what

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
I call it.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,080
And the Jews love rock band.

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,640
So I'm kind of curious if you've gotten your rock band on during-

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,400
Well, my friends do.

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,920
Because that's the one thing I noticed, I came over once I think for Jamie's birthday

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,360
and you know, all the Jew school friends were here.

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
And they were loving some rock band and I was like, okay.

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
I didn't really play much rock band.

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,200
I've actually, I'm not going to be doing a lot of gaming for the next week and a half.

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,240
Because number one, Dan has Gran Turismo 5.

49
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
And number two, finals.

50
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Bummer.

51
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Yeah.

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Busy week.

53
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
Bummer on both counts.

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
I'm just kidding.

55
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
I'm not hating on Gran Turismo 5.

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
I am.

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,000
Just to be serious, I'm not very good at the-

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm angry.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm angry.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm angry.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm angry.

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm great at arcade razors like Mario Kart and-

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,160
How can the Veyron not be a premium car?

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
IDK.

65
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Bastards.

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
All right.

67
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,280
Also say hello to, we got to introduce tech master, Loki.

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Hello.

69
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
How are you?

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Loki?

71
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm doing fine.

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Oh, alrighty.

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Good to hear it.

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
I know you're not, well no, your wife celebrates Hanukkah.

75
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,720
So have you been doing anything for that?

76
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
No.

77
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
No?

78
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
All right.

79
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,720
You're more of a, like a Chrismakka kind of family though, right?

80
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
A little bit?

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Yeah.

82
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Really.

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Yeah.

84
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Yeah.

85
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
That's the retail Christmas.

86
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
There you go.

87
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
That works.

88
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
What are you, what are you knitting over there, Dark Stock?

89
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
Are you making arts and crafts at OLR?

90
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
Um, I'm making a hat for a present for a friend who wants a hat.

91
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,240
And I'm, I took some leftover yarn and made myself a knit headband so I could be trendy.

92
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,880
You could make one of those in like an orange color and probably sell it for like 20 bucks.

93
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,160
I know, there you go.

94
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,560
Maybe this is something I could do while I'm not working.

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,320
I also do want to take a moment to poll our listeners and send us an email.

96
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Sure.

97
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,440
It's on our website at orangelandradio.com so Rob can read it.

98
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Okay.

99
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Wait a minute.

100
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,720
Hey, um, who would be interested in an Orange Lounge book?

101
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,240
I got a text message about this.

102
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,360
I want to know more about your thoughts on this.

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,840
Why you suddenly want to do a book.

104
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,040
Well, I'm sure the not having a job right now has a lot to do with that.

105
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,600
To commemorate our fans and how, talk how awesome we are.

106
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Would it be a pop up book?

107
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,280
Cause I'm not good with writing.

108
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,900
It would be a physical book to be ordered or an ebook.

109
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
An ebook.

110
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,600
Can it be something I listen to on my iPod?

111
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Cause that makes sense.

112
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,920
Cause you know it is a radio show.

113
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:02,960
No, it's a physical book with pictures and links to goodies.

114
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
It's like the OLR yearbook.

115
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
And Easter eggs.

116
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Alright.

117
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,040
Alright, well I got, I got to see what this is all about.

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,200
You know, one of, one of the other shows on all games does a magazine, the Electric Sisterhood

119
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,800
I think it is, does the magazine and I apologize if I'm misappropriating that, but you know,

120
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,960
it's been done where the shows move into other mediums.

121
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,160
So sure, OLR can have a book.

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Why not?

123
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,600
I think Michelle on the Outsiders shows has a book deal, but I don't think it has anything

124
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,360
to do with her shows.

125
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,640
You know the, um, what is that site?

126
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Oh God.

127
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,120
It's been everywhere and it's, it's her and her sister's site.

128
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,080
Uh, damn you autocorrect.

129
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
That's it.

130
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Have you seen that site?

131
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
That's her site.

132
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Oh.

133
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,600
And I think she's got a book now going on about it.

134
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
So you know.

135
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Cool.

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,280
If, if all these other all games people can do a book, so can we.

137
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Damn it.

138
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Why not?

139
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,080
Alright, anyway.

140
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,280
Ours just won't be as good.

141
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
Okay, anyway.

142
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
I'm designing it.

143
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
It'll be amazing.

144
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
Oh.

145
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Well, what'd you see?

146
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
I just got kicked in the face.

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
Alright, anyway.

148
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,400
Uh, all books aside, let's talk about video games and the games we've been playing this

149
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
week.

150
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Dark Sakura, what types of games have you been playing this week?

151
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Nothing.

152
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Nothing?

153
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,840
Well, actually Star Trek Online because I'm updating the Tribble server right now.

154
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:21,960
At, like, 1K, so, um, I, uh, well, I played some solitaire.

155
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,680
I've been very busy because, um, the American River Review, which is the magazine that I've

156
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,760
done some design for, goes to print on Monday, and we had-

157
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
This is where the book idea's coming from.

158
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,240
No, actually, I got the idea from the book I did for my client because we just published

159
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
it.

160
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Oh, okay.

161
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Um, it was really easy.

162
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,960
So, uh, it'd be very easy for us to do a book.

163
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,180
But back to, back to, uh, this.

164
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,240
The American River Review, um, and as soon as we have the order information up, I'll

165
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,240
be linking it to everybody, because you have to buy a copy, um, but the American River

166
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,920
Review is, uh, all of the, uh, literature, the art, digital, physical media, fashion

167
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,760
and culinary for, um, American River College for 2011.

168
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,880
We win tons of awards.

169
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,060
We beat out big schools.

170
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
We are amazing.

171
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,320
I did the culinary section.

172
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,920
I designed it anyway.

173
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,320
And, um, I think it's, it's definitely, you know, something that anybody should have a

174
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,080
copy of because it really is an impressive product.

175
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
And we had our proofs.

176
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,160
We got our proofs last week, and so that's what's been taking up my time instead of games.

177
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,120
But you said the hubby's been playing Gran Turismo 5, right?

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,040
Oh, well, when we did have some Scott Pilgrim.

179
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,360
Oh, fun.

180
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Yeah.

181
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,240
Uh, what is, is Gran Turismo 5 pretty?

182
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,120
Yes, except for the shadows are retarded.

183
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
A little early for that music.

184
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,320
Pretty as in that music.

185
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
As in that music?

186
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Is this as pretty as that music?

187
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,040
Some of the music in the game is very elevator-y.

188
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,640
I, I just want to say-

189
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,160
Well, there's new My Chemical Romance in there that makes me happy.

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,200
Dark Soccer gave me a beer before tonight's show, so if things are a little bit off tonight,

191
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,640
like what just happened, you know what, just, just roll with it.

192
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
How's it off?

193
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
This always happens.

194
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,320
Well, at any rate, at any rate, um, it's, it's got some stuff that needs to be fixed.

195
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,640
I still hate that all the people around the track are like, we're just standing here,

196
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,360
we are stiff, we don't do anything but wave.

197
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,760
And I'd like to see more stuff going around, because, because the game can handle it, it's

198
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
just not.

199
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
And then-

200
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,080
You want to see some women flashing their titties as you drive by.

201
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
That's what, that's what the game needs.

202
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,120
It is, the cool thing in this game is that it has the, um, the Top Gear test track, and

203
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,340
the Stig.

204
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,600
And your driver looks kind of like the Stig from Top Gear.

205
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,480
But it doesn't have Rainbow Road, which is really disappointing.

206
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,900
It does have go-karts.

207
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,000
It would be awesome if they just, you know, cuz, come on, it's Gran Turismo, they take

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,520
themselves way too damn seriously, um, just throw in some wacky shit in there, it's like,

209
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,040
you know, we're driving in space now.

210
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,320
I mean, cuz it's a real, a realistic sim racing game, but just put it in some very unrealistic

211
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,440
situations and have fun.

212
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,400
Gran Turismo 6, in space!

213
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,240
At any rate, it is, uh, very British.

214
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,320
Um, and I really can't describe that other than just saying, watch the game, it's very

215
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
British.

216
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,400
Um, I totally laughed my ass off at the rally section, because Dan was trying to beat the

217
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,280
rally cars, you know, focus.

218
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,640
And uh, well I mean, that's a good rally car, so, but I was like, very hard, easy right?

219
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:34,640
You know, making, doing the, the Sega touring, or Sega rally voiceover, so it was pretty

220
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
funny.

221
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,000
Um, they're supposed to be doing a patch that's supposed to fix a lot of the problems, so,

222
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we'll see.

223
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,080
I just sit in there sometimes and listen to the elevator music and usually I fall asleep

224
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,380
while Dan's playing.

225
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,380
So that's it.

226
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,920
Alright, let's go over to Loki!

227
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,640
How was your gaming week?

228
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,400
Doing, uh, you know, not too much gaming this week.

229
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Uh, mainly though, been playing, uh, this is kind of funny, it's an iOS game called

230
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Swords in Poker 2, and it's, it's really like, it's like a chibi role playing game, but the

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,800
whole battle system, not so much, I mean kind of like puzzle quests I guess, they, you have

232
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,080
a grid of, um, you start off with a grid of five by five, and then um, in the middle there's

233
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:27,520
a grid of, uh, three, three by three poker cards, and the whole goal is to make up different

234
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,460
poker hands, and by doing that you do specific amounts of damage to the monster that you're

235
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,240
attacking, and then, you know, the monster does the same thing as well, and you can charge

236
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,880
up a wild card and stuff, and then they have different magic that you can cast that rearranges

237
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,340
some of the cards or does different things, or, um, you know, shields that block certain

238
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,160
damage and stuff like that.

239
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
It's actually really fun.

240
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I've been playing...

241
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,480
Is it a free game, or when you had to pay, or what?

242
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,240
Um, no, it does cost money.

243
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Okay.

244
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,600
I don't know how much money, but it costs money.

245
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Alright.

246
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,800
Um, and yeah, very awesome game, so I've been playing that most of the week, and then other

247
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,000
than that, just probably, uh, Grand Theft Auto.

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
That's pretty much it.

249
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,960
Go into our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, there's a little bit of chatter going on with

250
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,240
our ever-present fourth guest on the show, you guys.

251
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,120
Uh, lots of talk on Gran Turismo 5, Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, Gran Turismo 5 looks

252
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,360
so amazing, can't help but be mesmerized by the graphics as I watch people play the game

253
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
on Justin.tv.

254
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,480
And Justin.tv, from what I remember when we were doing our video feed on there, uh, in

255
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,760
the old studio, it doesn't...

256
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,480
It's not like it has the best quality, so if that still comes across really well, uh,

257
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
that's pretty amazing.

258
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,560
Um, Dart Datsuya says, reminds me, whatever happened to the Gran Turismo kids' things

259
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,720
they were supposedly doing?

260
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,120
I don't even remember that.

261
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
Wait, Loki just kind of did this, ah, bleh.

262
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Hey, it'll never happen.

263
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Who cares?

264
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
It stinks.

265
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
It'll be coming out soon.

266
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,960
By soon we mean six years, I don't know.

267
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Alright.

268
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,720
Uh, let's see, and, uh, some of the folks in chat are talking a little bit about Gran

269
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,880
Turismo songs.

270
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,320
Uh, DJ Dark Knight says, need Kickstart My Heart, the best Gran Turismo song ever.

271
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,600
And Dark Datsuya says, actually, that's the first song on my Gran Turismo 3 playlist.

272
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,440
So, hm, a lot of talk about the soundtrack of Gran Turismo.

273
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Have you noticed the soundtrack?

274
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
It's got new...

275
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,480
Well, I said earlier it has New My Chemical Romance in there.

276
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
Oh, that's right.

277
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
That's right.

278
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
You were talking about all that.

279
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Well, once...

280
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,080
That's a nova!

281
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,400
One song that I do not believe is on the Gran Turismo 5 soundtrack, but is in a game we're

282
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,480
gonna be talking about a little later tonight, is...

283
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,640
I believe you made me want to stay.

284
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,800
That's right, that Happy Hardcore song from Techno Kitten Adventure.

285
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,720
It's Sea of Love by Frisco, if you wanted to know who it is.

286
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,960
Uh, you might remember last week on the show, we got a tweet saying that we needed to check

287
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,480
out this game called Techno Kitten Adventure, and, uh, we were laughing our ass off, because

288
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
it's just awesome.

289
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,280
Like, you know, laughing with them, not at them.

290
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,200
Uh, it's, you know, as people who play DDR for years and years, um, you know, this type

291
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,800
of music's right up our alley, and the fact that this whole music video is, uh, interactive,

292
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,280
and, you know, when they talk about touching the sky, there's actually a little finger

293
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,040
that comes down and touches the sky.

294
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Like, shit like that is hilarious.

295
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,480
So this game's a dollar, and it's on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

296
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,960
We're gonna have the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure on the show tonight.

297
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,520
That's right, from tweet to on-air interview in one week, it's amazing what can happen

298
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
here at OLR.

299
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,960
We're gonna have Nick from Techno Kitten Adventure at 7 o'clock, that's just over 30 minutes

300
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
away.

301
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
That's exciting.

302
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,480
Loki, you checked out Techno Kitten Adventure, huh?

303
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,040
You thought it was a little basic.

304
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:41,880
Uh, yeah, I played it a little bit, um, I don't know, it's similar to, I guess, like

305
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,800
the robot unicorn attack games, where the concept's very simple, but what draws you

306
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,920
into the game is just the fact that it's so unusual, I guess.

307
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Mm-hmm.

308
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Mm-hmm.

309
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,160
But, I mean, the gameplay itself, it's all one button, you just, you know, a button to

310
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,720
control the thrust on a jetpack.

311
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,800
I just, I don't know, if I were to improve something upon the game, I would maybe tighten

312
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,560
up the controls a little bit, at level 3, um, and then also, uh, maybe, you know, make

313
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
it a little harder.

314
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,080
Well, we're gonna ask him if there's any plans for a sequel, because, uh, the game has shown

315
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,440
up in the top games on Xbox Live Indie Games, right?

316
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
It's there.

317
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,440
It's not like the number one game, but it's not number 500, it's there.

318
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,520
So we definitely wanna ask him about that.

319
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,320
And I played the game as well, and, you know, even though it is as basic, let's say, as

320
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,080
an Atari 2600 game, I think, in fact I'm pretty sure I played a game like this on Atari 2600,

321
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:44,480
I think the environment that he created and just the, um, you know, absurdity, outside

322
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,000
the box type of thinking he constructed the game around is clearly this, wouldn't this

323
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,720
be funny if I combined X with Y and made Z, and I think it really works, especially for

324
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
a dollar.

325
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
It's a dollar.

326
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Rob.

327
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Rob, what?

328
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Dear, please don't say combine X, Y, make Z.

329
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
Why?

330
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Algebra, hell.

331
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,800
Are you having, are you having, uh, flashbacks to school?

332
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Ahhh!

333
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Alright, now.

334
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,080
That's what my final's in.

335
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,480
If 2X plus Y equals Z, solve for kitten.

336
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Meow.

337
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,560
Alright, so we're gonna talk a little bit about that, and I wanna know if he has any

338
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,040
other games on the marketplace as well, so we have to ask him all those questions, and

339
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,280
I think it's worth it for one whole dollar.

340
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,320
It's, it's the type of game you're gonna whip out a party and, like, look at what I

341
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
downloaded.

342
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Bobby's giving Loki a hard time.

343
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Why's that?

344
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
In chat?

345
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
You can't get more tight than one flippin' button.

346
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, you know, we were talking to Bobby, and of course, Bobby Blackwolf is the gentleman

347
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,840
that does the show before us at All Games Radio, the Bobby, Bobby, the Blobbly, the

348
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:45,680
Bobby Blackwolf show, uh, every Sunday night at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, and he always has

349
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,680
us on at the very end of the show, which is very nice, he doesn't have to do that, but

350
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,000
we were talking about this game a little bit, and, uh, we were kind of talking about how

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,160
– we like that somebody went there and did this and didn't just try to make a, a clone

352
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,840
of some other game, because we're all about the whole kind of, like, absurd, outside-the-box

353
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
sorts of ideas.

354
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,120
Remember President Cat a year and a half ago?

355
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,280
Why were we all excited about President Cat?

356
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,600
It wasn't really the game itself, per se.

357
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm sure the game itself was really just an average game, and I think a lot of the

358
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,400
blogs who ultimately reported on, wow, there's this podcast trying to get this game called

359
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,880
President Cat localized, what a bunch of weirdos, haha, I don't think they ever got that the

360
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,720
reason behind that wasn't necessarily the game itself, it was the fact that you look

361
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,320
at the Wii's lineup, and they're all clones of each other.

362
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,640
You know, it's, it's Nick Jr. games, and PopCap ripoffs galore, and Wii Sports ripoffs,

363
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,840
it's all the same damn thing.

364
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,840
President Cat, for what it's worth, was something different.

365
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,920
You play this cat driving a car and running a company, and it's, it's like that old,

366
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
uh –

367
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Just playing the piano.

368
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,400
Yes, and absolutely playing the piano.

369
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,040
Why can't we get original shit like that?

370
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,080
You know, why do we have to get these games we know are sub-par and below?

371
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,800
It's just, I don't know.

372
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Because we're America!

373
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Yeah, I know.

374
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Fuck you, man.

375
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
For everything is mediocre.

376
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Ugh.

377
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Alright, so anyway.

378
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,280
Oh yeah, uh, Majinma Khan in our chatroom says, uh, Muscle March.

379
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,240
That was a pretty unique Wii game, I will say that.

380
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,000
There was at least that, so, uh, it's, it's working.

381
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Anyhow, uh, so we'll get to, uh, more talk on Techno Kitten Adventure in about 30 minutes,

382
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,480
but in the meantime, uh, my gaming week, I didn't talk about my gaming week, I, I guess

383
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,960
I mentioned Techno Kitten Adventure, and, uh, I didn't play a whole lot else.

384
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,800
I played quite a bit of World of Warcraft, because there's big changes going on this

385
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,620
week, but, um, you know, I have the other show for that now, uh, so not a whole lot

386
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,520
I want to say here, uh, otherwise other games I played some more Super Meat Boy, uh, which

387
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,400
I think is a great Xbox Live Arcade game, and, um, that was really about it.

388
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,280
I had a work trip this week, so I didn't really get to play a whole lot of games at

389
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
home.

390
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,400
So, sorry guys, I'll try to play more next week.

391
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:56,060
Anyhow, uh, housekeeping tonight, join our Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge

392
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,520
radio, and of course our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, we'll be taking Twitter topics

393
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,520
later in the show, so definitely submit those topics, and, uh, email, email our show, mailbag

394
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,200
at orange lounge radio dot com, Dark Soccer's gonna read those in part B a little later

395
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,240
in the show.

396
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,080
For now though, we're gonna get into the news, Loki's gonna start us off tonight with some

397
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
gaming news.

398
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:25,320
Oh yes, um, so, you know, it was funny because they were actually, uh, quoting, uh, one of

399
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:32,080
the quotes made about this device, allegedly, was that, where there's smoke there's fire,

400
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,520
well, I don't think you can get much more fire than this.

401
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,440
Uh, the Playstation phone, of course, remember a while back they had some not so clear video

402
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,920
of, you know, the device, and people were like, well, you know, it's probably changed

403
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,740
quite a bit since then and whatnot, but now they have really clear video, um, showing

404
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:01,800
this brand new, uh, device called the Sony Ericsson, uh, Zeus Z1 Playstation phone, and,

405
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:08,120
uh, it kinda shows some of the features it has, the slide out controls, the, you know,

406
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,120
dual kind of, uh, touchpad thing on the front that simulates the analog sticks, uh, of course,

407
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,160
you know, the shoulder buttons as well, um, something that looks like, uh, it made possibly

408
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:28,660
a front and back mounted camera, um, lots of neat stuff though that you would expect

409
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,480
in, like, a Playstation phone, um, and they even had some video, of course, showing them

410
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,720
going to, like, the actual Playstation mode where, um, you could play different games

411
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,560
and stuff, of course, there's no games loaded on there, so, couldn't really do anything

412
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,040
with that, um, but it's very interesting to see all this stuff, considering that they've

413
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:53,360
kinda been denying, you know, oh, yeah, we're not working on a Playstation phone. Obviously,

414
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,860
something I would be willing to bet you'll see at CES, cause they, like, shown off this

415
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,600
new hardware stuff and, you know, it seems right up their alley. Here's the question

416
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,880
I gotta ask about this, is this the same thing as the PSP2? Because we've heard rumors about

417
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,800
a PSP phone, and we've heard rumors about a PSP2, and my question is, is it actually

418
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,700
the same thing? Because I thought the rumors about there being, um, sliders on the back

419
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,600
and all this other weird stuff that we're seeing in this video was for the PSP2. And

420
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,040
now that you mention it, that does make sense, the one, the not so clear video or pictures

421
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,700
that we saw before were of the Playstation Portal 2. Of course, we've seen some pictures

422
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:37,160
before of the Playstation phone, but they're different. You know, just in the design of

423
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,560
how they are and stuff, they look different. I mean, this is a little bit similar to, like,

424
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,360
the PSP Go, almost. And it does look like a phone. I mean, the slide-out keyboard, you

425
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,880
know, you could almost replace that with a keyboard and be it, you know, just a normal

426
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,120
Sony Ericsson phone. Could it, again, I hate to harp on this, but do you think that maybe

427
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,680
the PSP2 is just this without the phone? Like an iPod touches to an iPhone? Um, possibly.

428
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,200
And that would make sense. I mean, that would be, it would make sense, I would think. Um,

429
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,440
I don't know if it's gonna be, I don't know if I really care for the idea that it has,

430
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,640
like, a touchpad on the back of the device. I mean, I think nowadays you kinda almost

431
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,120
have to have everything as, like, a touch screen, you know. You can pet it and caress

432
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,560
it from the back. Well, it's just. You can literally reach around your PSP and rub it

433
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,880
a little. I just don't understand, I think it would be very awkward to have a touchpad

434
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,120
on the back. I mean, cuz, I don't think that would lend itself well to the games, um, unless

435
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,920
it's just some sort of, you know, context sensitive touchpad or something like that,

436
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,320
in addition to other things. Maybe it knows when you're getting frustrated and you're

437
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,660
about to choke your system. Like, you know how, like, sometimes you'll clench your grip

438
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,720
a little bit when you're getting very angry? And I've been playing a lot of Super Meat

439
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,160
Boy lately, so I'm very familiar with this. Like, rah! Nerd rage! Throw my controller.

440
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,320
Totally go off topic. Super Meat Boy now on the Xbox 360. Do you have any of the downloadable

441
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,960
characters or any additional characters in the game? I've only unlocked one. That's how

442
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,120
terrible I am at it. I can't get the bandages. I have, like, four bandages. I got the guy

443
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,440
that's Bit.Trip Adventure. Oh, okay. Or whoever he is. I have him. He's in one of the warp

444
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,560
zones. I just saw some videos. I think it's PC only, though, of the Minecraft guy. It

445
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:25,760
is PC only. I'd heard about that, yeah. Talk about cheap. But, yeah, so, I mean, definitely,

446
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,760
there's no question that this is going to be coming out at some point. I think they're

447
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,720
going to announce it at CES because it just makes sense. You know, consumer electronics

448
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,220
show. That's a really good theory is that this is CES and then the PSP2 is E3. Yeah.

449
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,200
That's a really good theory. Because it does seem things with the PSP have been very quiet.

450
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,840
I mean, outside of the Kingdom Hearts and God of War, you know, a couple huge releases.

451
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,160
You know, the Go kind of stopped, pun intended, the PSP chat for a little while. Because the

452
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,360
Go, no matter how Sony or the fans try to spin it, was a miserable failure. There's

453
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,860
not a lot of stuff coming out from Sony for the PSP any time soon. Other than, the only

454
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:14,760
thing I've seen was Potapon 3. Which, so what? I mean, the second one that you were selling

455
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,960
as a download title. I mean, so, I don't really know if that's a lot to talk about. That could

456
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,040
be the very last game they have in development for the original PSP. It could be just all

457
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,260
now PSP2 stuff. And I don't know if this would actually be marketed as a PSP phone. To me,

458
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,760
it happens to be, I mean, it's not branded as a Sony PlayStation Portable. It's branded

459
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,760
as an Ericsson. Granted, it's a prototype. But, it still strikes me as, oh, it's this

460
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:46,920
phone that happens to have PSP playing capabilities. Just like, there was that GameCube that was

461
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,520
marketed as a DVD player that happened to play GameCube games. But they didn't call

462
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,400
it a GameCube. The Panasonic Q? Yes, that's right. The Panasonic Q. Thank you. Yeah. That's

463
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,400
what I was trying to think of. Japanese only. Yeah, so, I mean, this is definitely coming.

464
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,480
And it kind of makes sense, because there was also a few patents that they filed from

465
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:11,780
Sony. It says, you know, some two finger touch devices. And this is saying that there's some

466
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:19,160
sort of track pad, you know, the rumored track pad on the back of the PSP2. And also possibly,

467
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,800
you know, something that's also that little touch panel thing that's on the front of the

468
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,800
PSP phone. Perhaps this is where this patent comes from. They're saying that it uses a

469
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:35,240
two fingered touch gestures for data manipulation. And they specified the touch interface may

470
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,320
be separate from the main display. Very similar to what we saw with the PSP2. And they also

471
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,480
said that it's possible that they could have some sort of thing where in the first and

472
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,840
second case portions are slidable, connecting to each other. And where in the visual display

473
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:02,560
the touch pad disposed of the same side of the case. Or the hell that means. So, I don't

474
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,480
know. It's interesting, though, that they're putting out the... I mean, just based off

475
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,440
what we've seen, I guess it's not making... I would be willing to bet that this thing's

476
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,320
going to have a touch pad on the back for the PSP2. It's going to have a touch pad on

477
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,920
the front for, you know, the PSP phone or whatever. I mean, the stuff that we've heard

478
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,280
over and over again and seen pictures of, I don't think this is going to change all

479
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,600
of a sudden. So, yeah, that's probably what we're going to expect. And if it's coming...

480
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,160
If they're going to announce this at CES, you only have a few more weeks to wait anyways.

481
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:38,280
I mean, it's mid-January, so... I don't know. It's probably coming. You gotta know they're

482
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,640
pissed about this, though. They are pissed about this video. Oh, come on! Every single

483
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:49,840
secret that they've had just leaks out! Sony, man, I... They need to do something about

484
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,200
that. Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangehontrady.com. SSJ100Matt, responding to a comment I made

485
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,760
a minute ago, says, Why would I give my PSP a reach around? It never did anything for

486
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,560
me. Never made me a sandwich. That's a good question. AlphaKnanogram says, Eh, I don't

487
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,920
think this phone is the graphical powerhouse the developers are saying the PSP2 will be.

488
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,200
That's true. There was that chatter, I think, that we covered on the show a few weeks ago

489
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,220
from a developer saying, We've seen it and it's a huge graphical powerhouse. So... Which

490
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:25,080
might explain how they plan to compete with the 3DS by presenting better quality graphics,

491
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,500
perhaps, than what you're going to see in 3D? Because maybe the 3D thing will get old

492
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,360
real quick. Who knows? BlackWolf seems to think that the PSP2 will be at Game Developers

493
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,460
Conference. Might be the better place to debut it. Not a bad thought. Sony is no stranger

494
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,520
to making big announcements at Game Developers Conference. I believe the move was really

495
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,920
shown a lot clearer at this year's Game Developer Conference. And home was originally unveiled

496
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,600
at Game Developers Conference, right? Sounds right. Oh, by the way, totally left that out

497
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,480
of my gaming week. But on a listener's tip, I did try going into home this week and doing

498
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:06,160
the whole DDR room or whatever. I couldn't even get it to work. I gave up. I threw my

499
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,760
controller into fitter age. Let's see. And then some folks are saying that it was the

500
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:20,520
Panasonic Q. Or as Frisbee says, the Panasonic QQQ. And lastly, Tigerclaw says, the PSP phone

501
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:27,940
is just Sony trying to get into the iPhone and Android market for an app gaming perspective.

502
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,960
Maybe trying to expand the Sony App Store or whatever. Trying to get more PS1 game sales

503
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,040
and the cross-platform PSN games you can buy and movies. Because you know this thing will

504
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,280
do everything that the PlayStation Portable already does. Trying to expand the marketplace

505
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,480
potential perhaps? Good thoughts. All right, moving on to another story. We're gonna talk.

506
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,200
This is a little bit of a follow-up to something that had come up last week. Remember when

507
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,320
I mentioned that Harmonix is for sale? Well, sadly, I'm not reporting about a buyer tonight.

508
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,040
But I am saying somebody has said they are out of the picture. And you might be surprised.

509
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,000
It came from an interview with Bloomberg at Bloomberg.com. The CEO of Electronic Arts

510
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,060
John Riccitello actually has said that the company has no interest in pursuing more multimillion

511
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,160
dollar acquisitions for now. The company is gonna focus on better integrating some of

512
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,920
the casual game developers such as Playfish and some of the other casual gaming things.

513
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,340
I mentioned Pogo is a part of that too. Of course, the people asked, are you interested

514
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,840
in Harmonix? And Riccitello said, if we did that, it would, quote, look like I'm doubling

515
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,840
down on yesterday. I'm sure some smart investor will buy the business feeling they can catch

516
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,260
a falling knife. But more people have been cut trying to catch falling knives that have

517
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:49,320
benefited from getting the timing exactly right. Ouch. I mean, he did also say there

518
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,560
was some nice things about Harmonix and so forth. But he seems to think that the whole

519
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:59,840
thing is a falling knife. Like, I get that Rock Band 3 didn't sell as much as Rock Band

520
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:08,840
2, but I think the question that's not really being answered for me is that Harmonix made

521
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,520
this whole Rock Band phenomenon. They made the original Guitar Hero game, remember? They

522
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,080
were working with Activision back then and Red Octane and all that. They made the original

523
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,680
Guitar Hero. They split off to do Rock Band, ABC, and so on. Who's to say Harmonix is not

524
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,880
gonna make the next big thing? That just seems, I mean, I realize you're taking a little bit

525
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,840
of a gamble there, but if there's one thing, there's one thing I could say in the 9, 10

526
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,520
years practically we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio, the developers that take risks

527
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,760
are the ones that get the big payoffs. The ones that just sit there with their thumbs

528
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,760
up their rear making the same old crap year after year, Konami, don't usually get to have

529
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,040
the big payoffs.

530
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,960
Eh, Konami doesn't really do that anymore. Well, okay, with their dancing games.

531
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,360
As far as the music games go and the stuff this show started about, yes, they did for

532
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,720
a very long time. And, granted, they've got some other neat stuff coming out now and they

533
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,900
still have Metal Gear, whatever, but as far as the music game goes, that's how I feel.

534
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:16,900
To quote the 62nd Ferengi Rule of Acquisition, the riskier the road, the greater the profit.

535
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,600
Hmm.

536
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:26,600
So, maybe they should be putting the masters of business forward.

537
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,280
Now, BlackWolf in our chat room is saying that the falling knife thing is actually a

538
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,680
misquote and the whole thing is not quite, I'm trying to look at what part of the story

539
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,240
this is in here, he just linked us to something here. I guess he actually came out and said,

540
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,440
I think the music genre is going to recover. I don't know exactly how. It could be based

541
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,480
on some new innovation. Maybe it all becomes dance-based. Well, because we've never seen

542
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,720
the dance thing before. Although, you know, granted there's Dance Central.

543
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,040
He says he likes harmonics and he said, when asked about it yesterday, what I said was

544
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,800
Alex, the co-founder of the studio, is a great developer. Harmonics is one of the great developers

545
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,920
of all time. They've got the leading dance product and maybe the leading game full stop

546
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,880
on Kinect and the question was what investors might be thinking about it. The nervous investor

547
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,760
would be worried about the decline of the music sector feeling like a falling knife.

548
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,660
The only part of that conversation that got reported was the falling knife part. So, he's

549
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:28,480
saying, I was misquoted. Although, I guess they did use a part that he gave them, but

550
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,360
whatever. He didn't mean to come off as harsh as he did. So, okay, at least I like the fact

551
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,680
that he acknowledges that, you know, harmonics could be also sitting on this big thing here

552
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,920
with Dance Central and I think that's true. So, I don't frown as much as I did, but it

553
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,240
doesn't change the fact that they aren't interested in acquiring harmonics at this time. And even

554
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,820
though maybe falling knife might have been harsh, it seems to be that the motivation

555
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:58,360
behind that is they don't have that next big thing just right yet, I guess. Although, it

556
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,840
is a little weird because he says Dance Central seems to be a big deal, but I don't want it.

557
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,560
Okay, fair enough.

558
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Fair enough.

559
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Let's move on, Dark Sakura.

560
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:16,800
Well, for the Doctor Who fans like myself, there will be the last episode for the Doctor

561
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,660
Who the adventure games called Shadows of the Vashta Narada, which, for anyone who doesn't

562
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,840
remember that one, this was the episode where they were stuck in the library and these things

563
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,720
were eating the people and it was the first episode that River Song showed up in. Aww.

564
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,760
But that's your little reminder of who the Vashta Narada were. But it's going to be taking

565
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,360
place during Christmas and will be underwater and you can download it on Christmas Day in

566
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,120
the UK. Well, it's free there. Here, you have to pay five bucks or you can get the whole

567
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,120
season for thirteen.

568
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Hmm. Where can you buy it here in the US?

569
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
I would assume the BBC website.

570
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,720
The BBC. This is all paid through the tax money they pay over there for TV, right? That's

571
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,120
how come they don't have to pay anything?

572
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,920
Yeah. And basically, you have to actually pay a television tax, depending, I think,

573
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,680
on your channels. But if you don't pay the taxes, people will come around and go,

574
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
okay, you have to pay us and blah, blah, blah.

575
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:27,080
Hmm. Interesting. The underwater Christmas adventure for Doctor Who. What I think is

576
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,600
interesting about this, because the BBC is kind of paying for these games, right? They're

577
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,240
paying for the development, right? So it's kind of like, you know, it's a very different

578
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,800
– and you have to pardon my ignorance here a little bit, but I've never lived in another

579
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:46,560
country. All I know is it's very different setup here in America than it is in Britain,

580
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:52,400
where it's a lot more, I guess you could say, to me, it seems like the BBC is sort

581
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,880
of like their PBS. But over here in America, we think of PBS as the network that plays

582
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,520
classic opera shows and Sesame Street and occasionally video games like that.

583
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,800
I don't think the BBC is.

584
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,560
But what I'm saying, over there, they're actually making this more cutting edge programming.

585
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,480
It's like, imagine if PBS was making the shows Fox was making. That's kind of what

586
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,400
it is. Like it's, I don't know. That's how it strikes me. But my point is, it's

587
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:25,360
interesting that now we have this whole gaming thing coming out of that, that is part of

588
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,160
the public broadcasting. Yet here, we don't have anything like that. PBS doesn't really

589
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,840
make games. And I think there's been stories on the show before about how there's kind

590
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,720
of been a call for that. Like why do we have the public broadcasting system, but yet we

591
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,920
don't have anything for making games outside of, I don't know, maybe like America's

592
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Army, although that's still the government contracting with somebody else to make that

593
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,640
for recruitment purposes. That's the closest thing I can think of.

594
00:33:50,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Well, just to let you know, the Doctor Who games are actually up on direct2drive.com.

595
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,000
You can just search for them there. But I'm going to put a link to the downloads in the

596
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,560
chat room. I like the point that Tiger Claw is making

597
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,400
in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com. Let's not forget PBS also plays British

598
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,440
shows. The first time I heard Doctor Who was PBS.

599
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,160
Well, that was my introduction to Doctor Who. And when I was little, and I like Star Trek

600
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,360
now, don't get me wrong. But when I was little, I didn't like Star Trek at all. I

601
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,760
was watching Doctor Who, which I thought was a lot cooler and a lot neater because the

602
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,120
concept was neat and it was this crazy old man and all these people running around with

603
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,560
him. And my first doctor was the fourth doctor with Sarah Jane. And she's, to this day,

604
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,060
my favorite companion. She's back in the series. She has her own series and it makes

605
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:48,920
me happy. But Doctor Who is just awesome. Um, Maji-Nami, Maji-Nami-Khan.

606
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:56,000
Say Maji-Nami-Khan. Whatever. Maji-Nami-Khan in our chat. I thought that's what I said

607
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,200
before, and I got yelled at for mispronouncing it. Whatever. Says, uh, and yet some political

608
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,160
extremists want to shut down all public broadcasts, radio, TV, et cetera, if I recall correctly.

609
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:15,160
Yeah, I've heard that too. And, um, I don't know. That, I, I, the thought, the thought

610
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,960
makes me sad because I, when I think of PBS, I think of Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers Neighborhood

611
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,280
and Bob Ross and shows like that, that wouldn't exist without PBS. And it just makes me very

612
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,180
sad. I mean, granted, maybe I haven't yet developed an appreciation for some of the

613
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,560
other stuff they show, like not in the morning or not for children, but I don't know. It

614
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,160
just would be very sad if that were to go away. You know what else PBS gave us? Faulty

615
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:47,720
Towers for our British television. Red Dwarf. I love Red Dwarf. You know, I watched Keeping

616
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,320
Up Appearances and Are You Being Served and Monty Python's Flying Circus. We need, we

617
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,280
need more of, of, of this on the PBS, but now we have BBC America, I guess. Uh, Gamer

618
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,880
Girl in our chat room says, wait, I'm lost. Why do they want to shut down PBS? Uh, without

619
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,160
getting too political on the show. Um, I, I think it just boils down to that whole,

620
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,160
you're poisoning the public minds with these crazy liberal ideas that PBS gives or whatever,

621
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,600
which is a little bit ludicrous to me. But I think, I think as Dark Soccer referenced,

622
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:25,340
a lot of it comes back to NPR. And when some people don't like what a public organization

623
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:32,120
is saying, they want to shut it down, I guess is the best way I can cut it. But there's

624
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,760
a lot of reading between the lines that goes with that stuff too. NPR gets a lot of its

625
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:47,320
funding too from the Democratic Party and PBS gets funding from political sources. But

626
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,120
I think that, you know, if people want to pay for it, let them pay for it. It's not

627
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,000
your problem. Just don't listen to it. But it's people too busy being right and wanting

628
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,800
others to think just like they do. That's the bottom line.

629
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,920
All right. But I'm not going to go any further than that. I'm just saying people being too

630
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,200
busy being right and wanting other people to think the way they do.

631
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,120
All right. Well, let's, let's talk about something we can all appreciate and that is sales, right

632
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,760
Logie? Oh yes. Of course, Black Friday always means

633
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:25,400
lots of big sales. And with that, you know, the game companies have to come out and start

634
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:32,800
waving their cock around, I guess. Connect, of course, sold very well. And they've reached

635
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,040
2.5 million units with the help of Black Friday. And that's worldwide, of course. And of course

636
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,960
that, you know, they break it down. That's a hundred thousand units a day. And that they're

637
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:53,000
on track to meet their original goal of 5 million units sold this holiday. So that's

638
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,840
pretty awesome, I guess. And I think they've already bypassed the move sales from what

639
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:07,060
I remember as well. Of course, Nintendo, they're saying that they sold a lot of DS's and Wii's

640
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:12,480
during Black Friday. It might help that they also had a lot of new colors for different

641
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,200
stuff coming out, new DSi XL colors. I still don't understand why people go crazy about

642
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:26,880
the colors, but whatever. They had the 25th anniversary red systems, you know, with, what

643
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,180
was it, Mario Kart in there. They also had, you know, the red Wii's, which people are

644
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:39,080
going crazy over for no apparent reason. And, you know, the orange and green systems with

645
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,760
different games with that. Anyways, they sold 900,000 DS units. And that's, you know, DS,

646
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:54,360
DS Lite, DS Lite XL. Or DSi's, I guess. And then of course 600,000 Wii's were sold. And

647
00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:01,960
that's during the week of November 21st through the 27th. That's really interesting about,

648
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,640
especially the number of Kinect sales. I mean, I'm hearing more people in the kind of the

649
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:12,720
mass media, quote unquote, saying that this is, you know, the Wii of this year or this

650
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,040
is one of the must have toys of the year. But it's kind of interesting because I think

651
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,560
when we sat back and saw that, you remember a couple weeks ago, like two or three weeks

652
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,360
ago, Microsoft came out and said we have a goal of selling 5 million units. And we were

653
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,360
like, oh, that's cute. But seeing as you kind of botched your 360 launch by not having the

654
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,900
units available, we kind of, and Nintendo did the same thing, we kind of think you're

655
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,600
gonna do the same thing with Kinect and won't meet that goal. But it looks like the supply

656
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,360
is actually meeting the demand a little bit. In certain markets, of course. Uh huh. How

657
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:47,240
so? Well, because, you know, the smaller guys obviously aren't getting enough, I'm sure

658
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,360
as hell know we aren't getting enough shipments of that shit. They're sending them all the

659
00:39:52,360 --> 00:40:01,080
retail, those fuckers. So yeah. Well, they obviously are shipping them somewhere because

660
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:07,400
they're selling those units, so. I don't know. They're still going for a pretty penny though

661
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,920
on eBay, that's for sure. Alright. Really? How much, what's the reseller market look

662
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,360
like on that? Because I remember with some of those things, oh my gosh. It's usually

663
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,420
50 to 100 dollars of retail. And they're going pretty good. Wow. Alright, well let's get

664
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:30,120
into a big story from this week. I don't know. And Loki asked me before the show, why are

665
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,320
we reporting on this? And I don't know, but I think the response to this is kind of funny.

666
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,480
So let me tell you what's going on. PETA decided to parody another game this week. You know,

667
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,640
they've done some video game parodies. They had like, I think there was like a Super Mario

668
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,380
Brothers parody and some of the crap too. But Super Meat Boy was the last game they

669
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:52,040
set their eyes on and they decided to make this parody called Super Tofu Boy. And Super

670
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:58,220
Tofu Boy is, you know, you play a chunk of tofu instead of a chunk of meat. They've made

671
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:04,140
Super Meat Boy the enemy in the game. Quote, Meat Boy is a vengeful, bloody cube of rotting

672
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:10,200
animal flesh and he smells. After a short-lived fling with Bandage Girl, he became enraged

673
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,920
when he was dumped for the tasty and satisfying Tofu Boy, etcetera, etcetera. That's the blabber

674
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,480
setup from the PETA game website. And the gameplay is, it's fairly similar to Super

675
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,000
Meat Boy, but it's, you know, obviously a cheap hack. Well, actually I shouldn't say

676
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,400
a cheap hack. It's, considering how fast this must have turned around, it's a pretty decent

677
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,480
hack, dare I say it. But whoever they've got programming the games at PETA seems to be

678
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:42,200
pretty talented like it or not. Anyway, the point is, Super Meat Boy came out and responded

679
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:49,360
to the whole Super Tofu Boy thing and with this tweet that's really, ouch, they made

680
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,200
a tweet. How many PETA members does it take to change a light bulb? None. PETA can't change

681
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,640
anything. But I'm bummed. That was pretty much their response to the whole thing. Not

682
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,600
quite just that though. If you read some of the other follow-up tweets and so on, apparently

683
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,260
the guy who made Super Meat Boy went on to the PETA forums and posted under some different

684
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,960
names to try to call attention to the game to, I guess, basically get free promotion

685
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,920
and it worked. That's the crazy part. I don't know if he's making that up in retrospect,

686
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,200
but I don't see why not. I think that's actually kind of a smart thing to do. Like, oh my God,

687
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,880
can you believe they're making this game out of a moving piece of meat and glamorizing

688
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,000
meat and meat is murder. So, I think that's kind of funny. Tasty, tasty murder. I think

689
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,320
it's really funny that it worked in so many ways. So anyway, now they've come out and

690
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,000
said, well, since we were able to get basically free advertisement for Super Meat Boy, we're

691
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,720
going to put Super Tofu Boy as an unlockable character in the PC version of the game. So

692
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:01,200
they came out and tweeted, if you type PETA file, P-E-T-A-P-H-I-L-E, at the character

693
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,520
select screen, you will be able to play as Super Tofu Boy. Wow, and I even made that

694
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,600
joke earlier. I had no idea. PETA file. Imagine on the con says in here, the funny thing is

695
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,640
that by Super Meat Boy creators' own admission, Meat Boy is a normal person without skin,

696
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:22,640
not a hunk of meat. Way to screw up, PETA. It's just a game for heaven's sake. And again,

697
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,200
I love Super Meat Boy. It's a great arcade game. I really think it's only drawback is

698
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,280
this whole like, what? It's a piece of meat? Like I don't, that's your mark. What? That's

699
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,960
the artwork? Really? That's the name of your game, Super Meat Boy? But whatever, I didn't

700
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,360
make it. People probably say the same thing about Orange Lounge Radio. Why the hell do

701
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,720
you call your video game show Orange Lounge Radio? You're not about oranges. You're not

702
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,400
about Orange County. Frisbee makes a very good point and this is very true. PETA, we

703
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,880
euthanize more animals than we take in even though we don't support euthanization. It's

704
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,640
true. I mean, they actually have to report all of this stuff to the IRS. It's a matter

705
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,120
of public record. By the way, Edmund McMillan, who is the co-creator of the game, he admitted

706
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,160
that he made fake usernames in PETA's forum pushing the game at them in hopes that something

707
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,120
would happen. PETA is 1000 times more well known than Super Meat Boy and the fact that

708
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,760
they went out of their way to make a parody like this is beyond flattery and amazingly

709
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,080
helpful. Edmund McMillan has said he was once a vegetarian and has worked as an animal control

710
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:30,560
officer and he disagrees with PETA's total stance against the lab testing of animals

711
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,800
and this is so interesting. He's saying that being against the lab testing of animals means

712
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,680
you're against these medical discoveries and treatments that save lives like his mom who

713
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:46,400
is diabetic and that's why he's against PETA. The person right under the PETA lady, Ingrid

714
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:55,240
Newkirk, is a diabetic who is on insulin made from dog testing. Interesting. I know, right?

715
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,880
Fun double standard, right? Anyway, why is it that this show keeps coming back to politics

716
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,880
tonight? I don't know, but I just found it very interesting that an author of a game

717
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,900
trolled the PETA forums and got his way. That's outstanding to me. I just hope it's not one

718
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,900
of those hindsight is 20-20 things. PETA is a cult! Alright, let's move on to another

719
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,160
video game story and then we're going to get into a whole other cult, the Techno Kitten

720
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:25,720
Adventure cult. I'm very excited to get there. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Well,

721
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:34,560
you know that pretty pretty pretty song that we've been listening to for Civ 4? I should

722
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,320
try to sing it because it's much prettier than I'm giving it credit for. I could play

723
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:47,240
a little clip. Not right now. It's been nominated for a Grammy. It's under best instrumental

724
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:52,460
arrangement accompanying vocalist category from the composer's debut album, Calling

725
00:45:52,460 --> 00:46:00,580
All Dawns. It's a really pretty song, I mean, it's been going around since they've included

726
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:08,000
it with the video games live. It's gorgeous, I really think it is, so I hope that they

727
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:24,080
win. Here's a little clip. It's kind of quiet, sorry guys. Civ 4 really did have this epic

728
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,200
theme song to it, which obviously is this, and then Civ 5 just pales in comparison. I

729
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,440
mean, Civ 5 is a great game, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't really have quite the

730
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:38,320
moving song that Civ 4 did, so I'm happy to see that a video game song gets acknowledged

731
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,760
with a Grammy nomination, but here's the weird thing to me. Civ 4 didn't come out this year,

732
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,280
so it is not getting nominated because it's from Civ 4. It's getting nominated because

733
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,700
Christopher Tin ended up making an album that happened to come out in the past year that

734
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:57,320
has this song on it. So you wonder, well, did it get nominated because people knew the

735
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,920
song already? But Civ 4 is, what, a four or five year old game. It wasn't nominated for

736
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,480
a Grammy four or five years ago. 2005, was it? Yeah. So it's kind of interesting that

737
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,400
it took this long, and you've got to wonder that, oh, well, maybe people knew about it

738
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,160
from here? Who knows. Black Wolf in our chat room wants to point out that Christopher Tin,

739
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:23,080
the album, was also nominated. So no matter how people found it, and if you actually listen

740
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,800
to the rest of the album itself, it is a really good album. You know, it's not pop or rock,

741
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,320
it's very different. It's a world kind of more, I don't want to say Enya, but more of

742
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:40,640
that, it's PBS music, actually. And that's not a bad thing. So also I like Akuma JP in

743
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,680
our chat room says Lion King. It does kind of sound like the theme of the Lion King,

744
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,640
does it a little bit? A little less Elton John, though? It sounds like the freaking

745
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,360
Avatar soundtrack. Does it? I've never really listened to the Avatar soundtrack. Is it that

746
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:57,640
good? I like it. I thought it had really pretty music in it, but it's the same type of, the

747
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,880
same theme. All right, well, I promised you guys that we were going to have an interview

748
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:10,040
tonight. So we are going to give Nick a call. He is the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure.

749
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,320
And I'm really excited to talk to him about the game and how he got on the, how we got

750
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,840
him on the show and everything. So we're calling him right now. This is totally live and unscripted.

751
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:23,640
Anything could happen, guys. If you have questions, post them in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

752
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,880
While we wait for him to pick up. Wouldn't it be funny if this went to voicemail? Like,

753
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:34,320
oops, I forgot. Hello? Hi, is this Nick? Yep. Hi, this is Rob with Orange Lounge Radio.

754
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,920
How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? Good. You are on the air on our lovely show

755
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,080
here that we do every Sunday night. And I want to talk to you a little bit about Techno

756
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:49,460
Kitten Adventure, your game for the Xbox 360. So I don't know if you know, but we had a

757
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:54,560
listener tweet us about this last week. We had no idea that the game was out there. But

758
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,920
our show was kind of founded on the games like Dance Dance Revolution and BeatMania

759
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,280
2DX. So we're definitely no stranger to happy hardcore. And of course we love kittens. Who

760
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,720
doesn't? So this game kind of seemed to be almost the perfect game in a way. So we have

761
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:19,240
to know, what inspired Techno Kitten Adventure, Nick? Well, I recently discovered happy hardcore,

762
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:27,480
which is the greatest genre of all time. And I played Robot Unicorn Attack a while ago.

763
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,800
And that kind of gave the idea to incorporate music into a game. But Robot Unicorn Attack

764
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,920
didn't really have everything going to the music. It was more like a background sort

765
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:45,800
of thing. And also, I like kittens, as you said. Who doesn't? So I wanted to incorporate

766
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,000
all three things into one. And that's what I came up with. Is this the first game you've

767
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,800
ever made? Or do you have other XNA games out there? Or was this like your first adventure?

768
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,120
I have a few more games out there. Some of them are not very good. One of the better

769
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:06,640
ones is Physics Sandbox 2. It's kind of like Crayon Physics Deluxe. I don't know if you

770
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,160
played that. I have. It was on Steam. Well, I'm sure it's still there. But yes, I have

771
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,080
played that. Very cool. Yeah, it's a lot like that. It's for Xbox. You've done other games.

772
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,680
How long did this game take you to make Techno Kitten Adventure? Um, a summer. I didn't really

773
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,480
spend too much time on it, though. Most of the time when it's actually licensing the

774
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,560
music. Okay, that was the next thing I had to ask you about. Because you didn't make

775
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:36,200
or write a song specifically for this game. You somehow licensed an existing song that's

776
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,280
out there, right? Tell me how you got the song and found the song and got the song in

777
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:48,000
the game, ultimately. Well, I'd heard the song before, like a trans version. And then

778
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,120
I discovered the Happy Hardcore version, which is from a company in the UK. Pretty popular

779
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:01,120
over there, but non-existent in the US. So I just contacted them and paid a fee and got

780
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,000
to use it for the game. Nice. And that song, of course, is Frisco with Sea of Love is the

781
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,200
song. Now, I don't know if you're allowed to tell us, so you can pass on this question

782
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:20,680
if you want, but do they get a cut of the profits because you used the song? That's

783
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:27,280
alright. What are the possibilities? Let me back up a little bit. How successful has this

784
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,760
game been for you? I know you're only charging a dollar for it, but I also noticed it was

785
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,520
in the top 50 indie games, which has got to be a hard place to get to. So has this game

786
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:41,480
been pretty successful for you, money-wise? It's actually been less successful than my

787
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,120
other games. Really? For an offer. But I think they were a lot more appropriate for the audience

788
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:55,640
that goes to indie games, which seems to be like 13-year-olds. Hey, wait a minute! Wait

789
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:01,840
a minute! Alright, so it hasn't been as successful to share the games. That's really interesting,

790
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,640
but definitely there's been an audience for it. I mean, do you plan to do anything else

791
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:13,840
with this idea? We are going to port it to Windows Phone 7, iPhone, and Android probably

792
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:20,760
within the next three months. You said we. Is there a whole team behind it? Well, I'm

793
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,960
working with another company right now. We're going to redo the art, most of it. Probably

794
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:32,240
add some new effects. I see. So did somebody find your game there and was like, we want

795
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,480
to work with you on this a little bit? I'm guessing it's got something. Yeah. Okay. I'll

796
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,840
get it on my phone. I was going to say, not bad for a bunch of 13-year-olds. One of them

797
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,320
has got their own company somewhere that's going to help you out. What about, you know

798
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,920
I've got to ask about a potential sequel to Techno Kitten Adventure? Is there a Techno

799
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,240
Kitten Adventure 2 in the works? Electric Booboo? I don't know. The company that contacted

800
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,240
me said that, depending on how well it does, they'll probably think about making a sequel.

801
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,440
I don't know if it'll be the same genre of music. For me, I'd like it to be some more

802
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,080
happy hardcore, but we'll see. It'll probably be a different genre. Well, this could be

803
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,800
like the whole new Dance Dance Revolution where you can have a whole soundtrack of music

804
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,600
to pick from for the different levels. But I imagine it's got to be kind of a pain to

805
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,760
sync up all those songs. You know, part of the charm that people are noticing of the

806
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,680
game is the way that the background kind of syncs to the song. Where did you kind of get

807
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,880
the idea to do that? Some of the syncing that you do in the game? Well, I started off just

808
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,200
wanting to make the Helicopter Clone and then having hardcore playing in the background

809
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,840
kind of make it like robot unicorn attack. And then while I was doing that, I made a

810
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,200
few effects on accident that worked really well with the music. So I decided to have

811
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:56,360
everything sync up with it, which took listening to the song a few hundred times, unfortunately.

812
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:01,120
But you love happy hardcore, so it's okay, right? Yeah, it's actually still a good song.

813
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:06,400
It is one of those rare songs that kind of works for a game like this. And I think part

814
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,800
of what made robot unicorn attack is that that erasure song kind of worked really well

815
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,240
for that game. But then they tried to do, there was like a robot unicorn attack metal

816
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,280
version or something, wasn't there, Loki? Yeah. You were talking about? And it wasn't

817
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,640
as good. It wasn't nearly as good. I liked it, but then the Christmas one, that's just

818
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,520
jumping the shark right there. So you gotta be careful, Nick, not to jump the shark. So

819
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:31,360
enjoy this. I played the metal version. It sucked pretty bad. Thank you. Unless you do

820
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:38,280
a techno shark. Techno sharks with lasers adventures. Alright, I got a couple more questions

821
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,880
for you. And that is, are you thinking though, you know, I know you got the company that

822
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,720
wants to do other things with this title and so forth. Do you think maybe you're going

823
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,360
to do another game that really has nothing to do with this whatsoever? Like this is just

824
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,280
kind of a one off thing and you have other games you want to do or do you want to kind

825
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,560
of play this out and see where it goes? Right now I'm working on a music based shoot-em-up,

826
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:05,000
which is going to be way more gameplay based rather than a simple one button game. Ah,

827
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,360
very cool. Do you want to, anything else you can say about that right now or is it all

828
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:14,400
still in the works? Um, it's pretty much going to be a music visualizer going in the background

829
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,920
and then just really hardcore shoot-em-up, crap load of bullets, bullet hole sort of

830
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,120
thing. Awesome. That sounds like it could be pretty awesome. We do have a lot of cave

831
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,480
shooter fans. That's true. I had to listen to this show. We have a lot of music game

832
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,400
fans. We have a lot of cave shooter fans. So I think there's going to be definitely

833
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,060
an audience. This is a very small audience, trust me, but there's an audience out there

834
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:38,720
for it. So, best of luck with all of that. One other question I want to ask you about

835
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,280
and that is about their reaction, you know, to something like this. Because when something

836
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:47,400
like this goes viral, quote unquote, you read a lot of interesting things on the internet

837
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,120
about the game. Do you ever Google Technokit and adventure to kind of see what comes up

838
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,400
or see what people are saying on the internet about your game? Or are you one of those people

839
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:02,400
that's like, I don't care? I look at it quite a bit actually. Yeah, what do you think? Um,

840
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,920
a lot of people like it and then others just haters gonna hate. Absolutely right. Oh my

841
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,800
god, that's my slogan I've said on the show before. Haters gonna hate. Absolutely. I agree.

842
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,640
Haters gonna hate. What's the worst thing you've read about Technokit and adventure?

843
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,820
Because I want to know, who can hate on a cat? Who can hate on a flying cat? What's

844
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:24,960
the worst thing you've read about Technokit and adventure? Um, most of them just say that

845
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,700
it looks like it was made in MS Paint. I haven't really read anything that horrified me. Haters

846
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:35,460
to the left. Haters to the left. You know what? I kind of think the art style in a way

847
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:41,280
is kind of part of the charm. Like, if it had been all like 3D, HD, Uber effects, I

848
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:49,160
don't think it would really be the same thing. That makes sense? So, I say, you go. And good

849
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,960
luck with all those future projects. Anything else you want to plug here on our little show?

850
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,760
Of upcoming projects or what have you? No thanks. Alright. Well the game, you have a

851
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,200
website or anything official website for? Not at the moment. There should be a website

852
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,440
in the works though. Alright. Well then, we'll let you guys know about it when Nick tells

853
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,320
us about it. The game is Technokit and Adventure and it is available at Technokit and Adventures

854
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:17,400
excuse me. And it's available right now on the Xbox Live Indie Games. It's one whole

855
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:24,080
dollar. Which is really not a bad price at all. It's the cost of a taco. As I said earlier

856
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:30,080
in the show, well technically on Sundays it's the cost of three tacos. A taco is for a moment

857
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:35,760
but Technokittens are forever. That's right. And as I was saying earlier in the show, I

858
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,640
also played Poker Night at the inventory this week which was five dollars. And I played

859
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,920
more Technokitten Adventure. So I think it was the better deal. So there you go. Alright.

860
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,560
Well Nick, thank you so much for being on our show. Really appreciate it. And best of

861
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,520
luck with your future projects. Thanks for having me. But don't make a metal version.

862
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:58,560
I will. Alright, thank you. Have a good night. Bye. I love it. From tweet to call on the

863
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:03,920
show, Technokitten Adventure. Nick from Technokitten Adventure. He didn't tell me his last name

864
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,440
but we'll give him a little bit of anonymity. It's not real ID here on the show after all.

865
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,720
Thanks to Nick for being such a good sport. And the Zominar chatroom says if you have

866
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,760
two dollars, you can have Technokittens and a taco. I don't know. In this economy, in

867
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:28,640
this economy, it might be tough. And that's value! Alright. Anyhow, let's move on to more

868
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,640
stories. Actually release dates. It's time for it to get to the show. So if you don't

869
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,920
want to get Technokitten Adventure or you've already bought it and you want to look at

870
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,840
other games, there's other stuff coming to a store near you, right, Loki? Yes, and this

871
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:43,200
will probably be the last week that stuff will be coming to a store near you, at least

872
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:50,080
this year, because it is dying down to zero. I mean, literally I think the week after next,

873
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:56,360
there's one game. And the week after that, possibly another game. And that's it. But

874
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,520
yeah, next week though, to kind of coincide with it, it's a little bit early, with the

875
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:08,320
launch of the new Tron movie, Tron Evolution. It's going to be kind of a prequel to Tron

876
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:15,320
Legacy, and that'll be coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360. Fuck yeah. And then they're going

877
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:25,160
to be doing kind of an arena-based sort of combat game. It's Tron Legacy Battle Grid,

878
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,200
and that's coming out on the Wii. Oh, and I guess it's also on PC as well. So definitely

879
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,560
check that out, that looks pretty exciting. Oh, and then the Tron Battle Grid, I believe

880
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:44,440
is also on DS, and possibly PSP. SBKX Superbike World Championship on Playstation 3, and I

881
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:50,720
believe Xbox 360 as well. And that's going to be kind of a street bike racing game. Yogi

882
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:58,440
Bear, the video game. And that's... Right? I hope that movie tanks. But sadly there's

883
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,840
kids that are going to want to see it. You know, kind of a bit of a side note here. I

884
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:07,760
actually got an invite, and I can't go to it. Well, let me put it this way, I'm not

885
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:15,240
going to it. For a Nielsen screening of a summer movie that's coming out next year,

886
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,360
and it's a computer-animated comedy. You know what happens to be sitting in the middle of

887
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:27,600
summer as a computer-animated comedy? Smurfs the movie. Oh no. Fuck no. Oh, so they don't

888
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,180
tell you what the movie is? They don't tell me what the movie is. Oh, but you should go

889
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:36,960
see it just to poop on it. No, because Nellie's like, if you leave me with the baby all night

890
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:44,840
long to go see Smurfs the movie, I'm going to kill you. That's fair. That is fair. Honestly,

891
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:51,040
I'm not going to risk the fact that it possibly might be Smurfs the movie, so I'm not going.

892
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:56,120
Sniper Elite coming out on the Wii, looks like a pretty generic sniper game. Which might

893
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:01,240
work a lot better combined with the Smurfs movie and Yogi Bear. You know that they will

894
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:07,200
be making a Smurfs game, I will have you know. Okay, not to get too tangenty, but I've had

895
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:13,840
not one, but several friends tell me that the Smurf village game on the phone, iPhone,

896
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:21,060
which is by Capcom, is actually really good for the whole like Wii rule, Farmville-y,

897
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,800
you know, Facebook-y type of game on your phone. No, I'm not touching that game. I saw

898
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,480
it and I was like, you know, I could download it for free and check it out and see if it's

899
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,520
any good. No, I'm not even going to check it out to see if it's any good. I'm sorry.

900
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:37,200
The only Smurfs game I've played and will only play is the one on the ColecoVision.

901
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,360
Yeah, absolutely. That's the one where you can get her naked. Smurfette naked. There's

902
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:46,960
a bug. You go backwards or something instead of going forwards at the very end and there's

903
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:52,280
a bug where Smurfette gets naked. I have this game. Really? I have a ColecoVision in the

904
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:57,040
game. I played Smurfs, like, cause I used to, when I was like four or five years old,

905
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,520
I was a huge fan of the Smurfs. I have to tell you this, I have to tell you this. Becky

906
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:06,100
just told me, Julian and I saw the preview for Yogi Bear and he said it looked stupid

907
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:11,400
and he's three and a half. I think Julian should be the official movie critic of Orange

908
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,640
Ons Radio. What do you think? I agree. He's the official child of Orange Ons Radio. During

909
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:23,760
Tron, they're going to have the new Transformers 3 trailers. Okay, this other game coming out,

910
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,760
the Touchmaster. Wait, wait, hold on, sorry. This is really important though, okay? It

911
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,800
was on the Atari 2600 and the ColecoVision. The ColecoVision version of Smurf, Rescue

912
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,000
and Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg or programming error. Upon reaching Smurfette's

913
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,960
screen, the player can return to the previous screen. Just before the screen changes, it

914
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,680
will appear as though the top of Smurfette's dress comes off, making her appear topless.

915
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,800
Two of the background music tracks are simple, you know, whatever, who cares about the music.

916
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,160
So yes, Smurfette gets topless if you go backwards. If you leave her ass, she'll show her titties

917
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:01,080
to get you to come back. Awesome. Sorry, Loki. It was worth reporting. Yeah, it was worth

918
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:06,080
reporting. You know when she made She Was Evil? Touchmaster Connect, it's all those

919
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:11,980
wonderful bar games that they have. What makes it unique compared to some of the other ones,

920
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:16,960
you can share your scores via Twitter and Facebook using this DS title. So, that's kind

921
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:24,360
of neat I guess. Yu-Gi-Oh! 50's Dual Transer coming out on the Wii. And how can we not

922
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:30,080
forget World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the new expansion coming out on PC. Hey, what did

923
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:38,520
Nick say, DarkSagra? Haters gonna hate. No barfing over there. Also, let's see. Bejeweled

924
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:48,520
3 on PC. That's pretty awesome. New You Fitness First Yoga and Pilates on the Wii. And then,

925
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,560
sorry, I must have had something on my throat there. And then finally, a week from today,

926
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:57,280
Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition for the Wii. It's just a Super Nintendo game!

927
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,720
Seriously, are you gonna pay Nintendo? They did nothing to the game other than make it

928
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:12,880
work with the controls. And you're gonna pay them $30? Alright. If that's what you really

929
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,200
want. But it comes in a shiny box. You know what kind of a message you're sending to Nintendo.

930
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:23,240
You can buy anything that you sell. And then it's gonna be remade in 3D and be $35 on the

931
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:28,680
3DS. Wait. Wait for it. There's better ROM hacks out there. I mean, what was it? New

932
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:33,840
Super Mario Bros. 3. Remember that? The whole, they completely re-edited the levels for the

933
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:38,600
DS version to Super Mario Bros. 3 and bonus levels and added all these challenge maps

934
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,620
and stuff? See, that's a value right there. They put that on a cartridge, I'd buy that

935
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:48,600
shit in no time, but I'm sorry. They did nothing. They didn't even try to make it new. By the

936
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,680
way, since you flew by Bejeweled 3, which I think will actually be a big seller because

937
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,640
those PopCap games do very well. Zuma Blitz is a game I actually played this week because

938
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,920
they have the whole beta thing or whatever. It's not very hard to get into. On Facebook,

939
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:07,400
it's a Facebook game. It's Zuma in a Minute. It's actually pretty good. It's pretty addicting.

940
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:13,120
And you know, it's free. They have their whole like, you can buy things to unlock more special

941
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,540
blah blah blahs. But as far as the whole like competing with your friends for high scores

942
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:21,440
and so on, you know, it's cool. It's just like the Bejeweled one. Or here's something

943
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,360
even better. And yes, I know that the stuff is already available on, you know, the Virtual

944
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,800
Console and stuff like that. Why? I mean, they've got a whole damn disc. I can tell

945
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:35,160
you right now that this image of this disc is probably going to be like a few megs. And

946
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:39,880
that's it. And the rest is just all blank space or filler or whatever. I mean, why didn't

947
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:47,160
they put like Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2 on there? Maybe Mario 64. You know,

948
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,480
make it worthwhile. And hell, you could even charge, you know, 50 bucks for it at that

949
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:58,440
point. Because it's, you know, full of all the Mario games. But no, there's Mario All-Stars.

950
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:03,960
Maybe there's an unlockable. No, there's not an unlockable. Yeah, there'll be an unlockable

951
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:09,760
alright and guess what it'll be? Demos. Virtual Console demos. Hey, you like these games?

952
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,080
You can give them their original form on the Virtual Console. Anything else for this week,

953
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:19,360
Doki? Ah, that's it. Alright, let's go to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates.

954
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:24,000
On the Xbox 360, Japan gets their version of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood this week.

955
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,880
Also, Kinect Animals in a regular and limited edition. A price reduction on End of Eternity,

956
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,580
but a new game Need for Speed Hot Pursuit over there in Japan and Your Shape Fitness

957
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:37,240
Evolved. Looks like some of those Kinect games took a little bit longer to localize, but

958
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,440
they're finally making their way over to Japan. On the PlayStation 3, also Assassin's Creed

959
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,440
Brotherhood. Price reduction on End of Eternity, a game called Free Free Bowling, which I'm

960
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:53,840
thinking is the Move bowling game localized for Japan, and a USB Neo Geo pad from SNK

961
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:59,680
Play More comes out this week. It is basically a Neo Geo pad with six buttons for fighting

962
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:04,680
games, probably for use with some of the Neo Geo games that are on PlayStation Network.

963
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:10,680
Going over to the Nintendo Wii this week in Japan, Donkey Kong Returns makes its way out.

964
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,560
Uh, for once, we got a game about a week before they did. Fitness Party also comes out from

965
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:23,720
Namco Bandai, and a karaoke game called Karaoke Joy Sound Wii Super DX Hitori de Mina de Utai

966
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:29,760
Hodai comes out from Hudson this week. That is a hell of a name there. The name doesn't

967
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:36,720
quite make sense to me. Hitori de Mina, that's like, okay. It looks a little bit like Karaoke

968
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:42,080
Revolution meets once in a while the actual music video, but otherwise it's party girls

969
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:47,160
dancing on a stage. Like, I don't even, I can't even. Is there Para Para? There's no

970
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:51,680
Para Para. Not worth it. How about Pac-Man Party? That is also coming out in Japan this

971
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:56,120
week, and Boom Blocks gets a price reduction in Japan. Oops, sorry, that's the 16th, that's

972
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:01,640
next week. Sorry. So let me keep going with this week on the Nintendo DS. Castlevania

973
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:06,840
Dawn of Sorrow gets a price reduction, so does Ganbare Goemon. As far as new games though,

974
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:12,440
one of the ones you might want to check out is Ninokuni Shikoku no Madoushi comes out

975
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:20,440
this week. This is, it's an RPG from level 5 and, dammit, I think this is out here in

976
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:25,560
the US as something else and I can't tell what it is. But it's an RPG from level 5 in

977
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,000
Japan, I'm sure somebody in the chatroom will correct me soon enough. There's actually an

978
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,400
official website for it. Should I look at it real quick? I think this is a pretty big

979
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:38,640
DS title. Maybe somebody in chat knows the rest. As far as the Sony PSP goes, not a lot

980
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,200
of big stuff this week, although there's some price reductions on things like Valkyria Chronicles

981
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:51,040
2 and Kuroganni no Lene Barrels, Hudson the best. Oh, you know what this game is? I believe

982
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:57,000
this is the DS game that's made with Studio Ghibli. That's what this is. Cause the artwork

983
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:04,200
looks very, very, uh, like that. I think that's what this is. So I don't think it is out here

984
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,360
in the US, but I think I've read about it, that's why it sounds familiar to me. Yeah,

985
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:11,800
look at this, this looks like Studio Ghibli, doesn't it? With the little guy with the lantern

986
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:16,480
on his nose and everything? That's gotta be what this is. Nice. No other studio puts lanterns

987
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:21,320
on noses. No, no other studio would do that. There we go, thank you, chatroom's jumping

988
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:25,280
in there saying yes to Studio Ghibli, it's the one with the huge 300 page magic book,

989
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,840
that is Dungeon Buster. Thank you. I figured it out eventually. Alright, Dark Sakura, how

990
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:36,720
about the UK? In the UK we have a number of games, although not many. On the 7th is Alien

991
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:43,460
Breed 2 Assault and Bejeweled 3 and World of Warcraft Cataclysm, sorry. Hater. I'm not.

992
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:50,120
On the 8th is Bomberman Live Battlefest. And then on the 10th we have Cave Story and Golden

993
01:09:50,120 --> 01:10:00,200
Sun Dark Dawn. Oooh. Alright. And that's about it. Alright, not a bad week all things considered,

994
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,920
I mean considering we're getting really close to Christmas, I mean, whether Dark Sakura

995
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,600
likes it or not, Warcraft's gonna be a huge game, and hey, there's Tron, and there's...

996
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:14,440
I don't give a crap about Wordcraft or Warcraft. I mean, to be honest, I just do it to give

997
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:18,720
you a hard time. There's Plants vs Zombies is in it now, that's all I'm saying. I just

998
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:24,080
like giving you a hard time about it. I know you do. Mwah, mwah, mwah. A couple more news

999
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:30,840
stories for you guys. I'm a Vice Admiral. And then the classic game of the week. Yes.

1000
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:35,840
So this is kinda cool. You know, and they were talking about possibly making a game

1001
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,920
based on this, but now it's been confirmed that Christopher Nolan is actually working

1002
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:47,560
on an Inception video game. And I think that's really cool. Love the world of Inception.

1003
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:53,600
Love the movie. I still haven't seen it. But it comes out on Blu-ray this week, so I plan

1004
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,160
to rent it. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Do not watch anything else. Because I'm sitting

1005
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:01,760
here going, all I know is that there's a room spinny thing that might be cool in a video

1006
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,000
game, but otherwise I don't know why this would make a good video game. Can you tell

1007
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,120
me why this is gonna be an awesome video game without spoiling the movie? Okay, think of

1008
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:17,680
it, it's like, it'd be like why the, except, you know, the MMO sucked, like The Matrix,

1009
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:22,360
why The Matrix was kind of a cool movie. It's really the environment of it and everything.

1010
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,800
It's just a really neat concept. The Matrix game that was on like GameCube and PS2 was

1011
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,880
not as terrible as I think some made it out to be. Here, let me put it this way. Inception

1012
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,440
has that vibe of the first Matrix movie. Like, you know, they set up a world, it's kind of

1013
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:41,360
similar to our world and stuff, there's a lot of gun combat and stuff like that, and

1014
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,040
then there's a lot of weird twists and stuff to it and ways they can manipulate the world

1015
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:51,320
and stuff like that. Before Neo got way too damn powerful, you know, it's the cool part

1016
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:57,480
of The Matrix. Without the other movies. Okay. Yeah, so it's got that vibe to it and it's

1017
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:04,520
really awesome. That could be cool. Yes, and that Joseph Gordon Lovett guy, man, it's fucking

1018
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:11,040
awesome. That's the kid from Third Rock from the Sun, or he was also the kid in Dark Shadows

1019
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:16,480
years and years ago. Did you ever see that movie Brick? You need to see Brick. No, I

1020
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,660
haven't seen Brick, but he was in some other movie I saw called Mysterious Skin and I kind

1021
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:25,480
of felt dirty. I was like, this is the guy from Third Rock? He's a really good actor

1022
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,840
nowadays. He's a pretty good actor. I think Mysterious Skin was by the guy and he does

1023
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,640
all these messed up teen angst movies. He did like the Nowhere, I think was one, it

1024
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:38,440
was totally fucked up and there's another one in that whole series. All those teen angst

1025
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:42,760
movies and he did that too. Anyways, yeah, so he's an awesome character, or he plays

1026
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:48,040
a really awesome character in the movie and then of course, you know, DiCaprio's alright.

1027
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:53,920
But yeah, seriously, the movie Brick though, it's a film noir set in a high school. In

1028
01:12:53,920 --> 01:13:00,380
modern day high school. It's really awesome. All the dialogue though is like film noir.

1029
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:05,040
It's just so badass. It's just, you gotta see it. It's really cool. I'll take your word

1030
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,960
for it. Anyways, yeah, Inception, amazing movie. So the video game, you know, games

1031
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,280
based off movies aren't that great all the time, but if Christopher Nolan's actually

1032
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:26,200
working on it, maybe it'll do alright. Basically he says now, he was considering putting together

1033
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:32,640
a video game based on the movie, but it looks like he's actually, his plans are going a

1034
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,920
little bit further than that. He says he's told Entertainment Weekly that the project

1035
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:43,760
is a go and that he's working with a full team on the game as a longer term proposition.

1036
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,120
He's excited to explore the medium of gaming by creating a new story set in the world of

1037
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:56,880
the movie. Entertainment Weekly suggests an MMO, but hopefully it's something better than

1038
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:02,640
that. Interesting. I could see an MMO, but the problem I see with an MMO though, is that

1039
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,440
it's gonna be like The Matrix Online. The Matrix Online just had some flaws. Like The

1040
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:13,200
Matrix could have made an awesome MMO. It's just that what they released wasn't it. Just

1041
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,440
like the Wachowski Brothers could have made an awesome trilogy. But they're like, let's

1042
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:24,040
give Neo all these powers all of a sudden. To this day I've never seen the third movie.

1043
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:27,600
To this day I've never seen the third movie. You're not missing much, it has an ending

1044
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,920
reminiscent of a Highlander 2, which was also a crappy movie. That's what I hear. Wait,

1045
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,720
but didn't Highlander 2, wasn't that the one that introduced Sean Connery? Or was he in

1046
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,800
the first one too and I just forgot? The first one. Dude, he was Ramirez. I forgot. You know

1047
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,680
how many years it's been since I've seen Highlander? That was like in college where everybody got

1048
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:46,800
high and watched Highlander, but I didn't cause I'm... It's called Highlander man, you

1049
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:55,680
gotta watch it high. I went to Chico State folks, enough said. Enough said. As you drive

1050
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,880
up 99 and it starts to smell like marijuana, it's cause you're passing through Chico on

1051
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:05,280
your way to Humboldt. Although actually that's 101. But forget it. Anyway, how about another

1052
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,680
news story that isn't drug induced. Let's talk about, well you might be able to watch

1053
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,820
a lot of Cheech and Chong movies on this though if this comes true. Microsoft is apparently

1054
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:18,880
in talks, this is if you want to believe Reuters, to bring subscription television and networks

1055
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:25,220
to Xbox Live. This strikes me as kind of a duh. I think Microsoft's been slowly moving

1056
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:30,080
in this direction, but whatever, fine. At least we have a little more news to it. At

1057
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:35,000
least courtesy of Reuters, who's like the Associated Press. Apparently Microsoft is

1058
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,480
having meetings with various media companies to talk about licensing TV programs to be

1059
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:47,000
streamed through a Xbox application. The talks apparently are going well. Although, excuse

1060
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,160
me, I have a frog in my throat, like if anyone saw that Susan Boyle clip from TV this week.

1061
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:58,320
Xbox Live TV is apparently a year away at least, which makes sense to me. If they actually

1062
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,640
are going to do something like this, they'll announce it at E3 and roll it out during the

1063
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:08,760
holidays. There is the possibility there that there will be interactive elements into shows

1064
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:14,080
viewed on the console and that there'll be also content silos, meaning that like HBO

1065
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:19,560
and Showtime could have their own little areas to subscribe to. So, could be interesting.

1066
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:24,020
I like this because remember when I talked about the whole one versus 100 getting canceled,

1067
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:29,400
I was like, why doesn't Xbox make more of a network out of this? I was kind of talking

1068
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:36,760
about this. I like this whole idea of interactivity or more interactive shows. Like, I think Xbox

1069
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,680
had a great thing with one versus 100 and it's a damn shame that they lost the rights

1070
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,520
to the new Game Show Network version or whatever the hell it is that's going on. Which, by

1071
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,680
the way, have you seen the new Game Show Network version with Carrie Ann Inaba as the host?

1072
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:55,800
Yeah. It's not as fun as it was on Xbox Live, sorry to say. I'm actually really into something

1073
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,800
like this. I just hope the interactive stuff isn't cheesy. Like, you see a lot of Blu-ray

1074
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,640
discs that have the interactive movie component, which is just asking dumb poll questions and

1075
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,440
things. Like, I would like them to see them do more like interactive game shows. We've

1076
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:15,920
had the rumor of a Poker Night game that's apparently in top secret testing right now.

1077
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:21,920
I mean, maybe there's a show to be made of that. I don't know. What if you could vote

1078
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:27,120
on the ending? Vote on a character getting killed off or what have you. American Idol

1079
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,480
being voted on through your Xbox. X Factor on Xbox.

1080
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,680
I would think, if anything, what the interactive part might be is like marking clips or something

1081
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:39,920
like that and sharing them with friends. Say, hey, have you seen this? This is pretty cool.

1082
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:48,200
Hey, look, it's a nipple slip. Wait, so you think this is more like a TiVo that you could

1083
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:52,640
share? So if there's ever another Janet Jackson booby that slips out, people could be like,

1084
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,240
hey, I saw this awesome clip I wanted to share with my friends.

1085
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:00,960
Well, it's like, I guess, Justin TV where you can save clips and stuff.

1086
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,160
Oh, God. I hope we're not going to be life casting through our Xbox. There's certain

1087
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:09,880
people I don't want to see their lives. I mean, the Kinect is putting a camera in all

1088
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:15,320
of our homes, but this is not an idea I like. Although, oh, my God, could you imagine, like

1089
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,400
now when they do one versus 100, like with two and a half million Kinects out there and

1090
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:26,920
growing, they could have the one be on TV with the whole Kinect thing, which is a nice

1091
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,360
little camera in your house.

1092
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,640
Yeah.

1093
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:40,880
It's alive. And then the Xbox 720 will just be called Skynet. That's that's where we go

1094
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:48,920
from here, right? Chat dot orange launch radio dot com if you want to chime in on this live

1095
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,920
with us.

1096
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:58,280
Well, isn't Sky a service that's in the UK and technically isn't it a network?

1097
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:02,840
Have you seen this boy? He's on in our chat room, says that's the new show on current

1098
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,120
TV Bar Karma. Viewers make the story and they produce it.

1099
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:13,440
Here's a question. This is totally random. And they've got to have this like some sort

1100
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:17,560
of photoshopped, you know, have you seen this boy with pedo bear?

1101
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,880
I'm sure it exists somewhere.

1102
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,880
That'd be funny.

1103
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:22,880
Absolutely.

1104
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:28,640
Let's see the name that I can ever pronounce. Majinomicon in our chat room says D.C. figured

1105
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,440
out a way to capitalize on this. They announced a telephone poll for readers to decide whether

1106
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,440
he lived or died.

1107
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,440
Jason Todd.

1108
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,920
Yep. Ten thousand votes later, he was dead.

1109
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,920
Everyone hated Jason Todd.

1110
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,920
Yeah, but that.

1111
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,400
And guess what? He's live again.

1112
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,160
You know what? They did that in the 70s with Andy Kaufman on Saturday Night Live. So I

1113
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,240
don't know if that's really remember. Well, I know none of you were alive when this happened.

1114
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,320
I remember that. It was 10 years before I was born.

1115
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:57,760
Wasn't in the Man on the Moon movie. I don't know. But they did a whole viewer poll thing

1116
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:05,480
to banish Andy Kaufman from Saturday Night Live. And he was banished. Or I remember.

1117
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,800
I'm going to really date myself and make myself super lame here, but I don't give a fuck.

1118
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:14,920
All right. Do you remember I'm married with children? They had a night where you could

1119
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,880
vote on the ending if Al Bundy was going to actually tell Peg he loved her or not. Like

1120
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,680
it was a whole I think it was for Valentine's Day. And you could actually call in and vote

1121
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:30,160
on the ending where if Al Bundy is going to say, I love you, Peg, or just go to bed without

1122
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:38,400
saying it because the whole episode was about Peg was whining. Oh, Al.

1123
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,960
You never you never say I love you to me or whatever was the whole plot. That was such

1124
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:51,160
a great show. I'm sorry. But they had an interactive episode. So, you know, but that's did they

1125
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:56,080
from what I remember? Yes. He he said, I love you at the end of the night. It was all the

1126
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:02,720
women voting. But anyway, I wanted to give you beer more often. I said that to get a

1127
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,120
reaction out of dark soccer and didn't really get one. All right. I gave him I gave him

1128
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,000
a look. I did get side eye a little bit. It doesn't transfer well to radio side. I like

1129
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:19,040
Anyway, Rob gets a snort. I don't remember what I was busy looking at gay. I also remember

1130
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:24,120
an episode if you can't do that on television where you could vote, but that wasn't real.

1131
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:29,600
I remember dating myself that does not compute episode where they used gray slime. Thank

1132
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:36,680
God SSJ 100. Matt in our chat room says I remember this. Thank God it's not just me.

1133
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:40,460
I grew up. I'm married with children. That was my show. All right. Speaking of blast

1134
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:43,880
from the past. We like to do a segment here on the show where dark soccer digs through

1135
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:52,880
the archives of gaming and finds a game that she says, Hey, Hey, you. Hey, listen, my line.

1136
01:21:52,880 --> 01:22:02,200
Oh, Al, I found the gayest game ever. Oh, Dan. You should play this game. I've been

1137
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,880
trying to get him to download it for me and he won't do it out of pure principle. So somebody

1138
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,600
needs to get it for me. All right, dark soccer. What is the classic game of the week? Joe

1139
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:18,320
on a key. Like I said, gayest game ever. I'm kind of sad that I asked, but here you go.

1140
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:26,520
Seriously, when I told Rob I was picking it, he replied with LOL game. So funny key. It

1141
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:33,560
means super big brother. It's a game series done by Masa. Yeah. And published by NSC core.

1142
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:40,440
It came out in 1992 for the PC engine with lots of spinoffs and sequels and other versions.

1143
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:47,280
It's a mostly most versions are side scrolling, shoot them up, plays kind of like Gradius.

1144
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:54,420
We did get Joe on a key on virtual console and somebody needs to give it to me because

1145
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:57,560
I've actually still been looking for Hugh Carter of this. I would love to have a copy

1146
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:06,080
of Joe on a key. So yeah, to start with the first game, the plot is, has the heroes who

1147
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:13,800
are these big buff muscle bound men in Speedos. Going through different areas, space, ruins,

1148
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:21,480
cities, fighting alien invaders and Bo Emperor Bill, which is built a bit, which is supposed

1149
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:30,040
to be a short of body build, is basically man who achieved 10 consecutive victories

1150
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:36,860
in the great galaxy body building contest is facing an ever decreasing supply of protein.

1151
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:44,060
So he's invading other star systems to establish protein factories. And so the heaven realm

1152
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:53,800
sent Eda Ten and Ben Ten to take over Bo Emperor Bill. And so it's a sweaty, hot muscle battle.

1153
01:23:53,800 --> 01:24:03,200
Yes. But the main characters actually in this one was, Eda Ten was just a pretty guy and

1154
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:08,840
Ben Ten who was a girl blue hair. And then you have the muscle bound men, Samson and

1155
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:16,800
Adon who are the muscle bound men in Speedos and they hover around and they are the brothers.

1156
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:25,160
So yeah, it's weird. Basically the whole genre of games that these are in are what's called,

1157
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:33,160
they're very kitschy. They're called bakage, which is like idiot game, sort of a lighter

1158
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:44,600
of the kusoge, which kuso means shit. Shit game. So this is bakage. It's campy. It's

1159
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:52,760
really weird and fun. It's half naked men in suggestive homoerotic poses. And fairly

1160
01:24:52,760 --> 01:25:02,640
neat. It's not really pornographic, just gay. GAY! And the rights to the series are now

1161
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:08,400
actually owned by Extreme Co. Limited. So the different games in this series, we have

1162
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:16,200
chowaniki, we have ai chowaniki, which ai means love, so we have love super big brother.

1163
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:20,680
And it has a slightly different control scheme. You can actually do special attacks by doing

1164
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:27,880
street fighter style button meshes. And in this one you fight the, you actually have

1165
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:36,760
to raise the Nioh builder army, well the bad guy. His name is Botekunshiyasu, which is

1166
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:45,000
body conscious, it's a pun, to fight Ita-ten and Ben-ten. And they fall in love and elope.

1167
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:53,480
So Samson and Adon have to fight. And it's, yeah. It came out on Virtual Console Japan

1168
01:25:53,480 --> 01:26:00,520
in 2007. Chowaniki Bakuretsu Rantohen, which is a different one, it's a fighting game.

1169
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:07,520
You have Ita-ten, Ben-ten, Samson and Adon. They attack by gyrating and flatulating.

1170
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:14,360
You have Sabu, who is a pagoda shaped ship with Elvis Presley on the top. Mommy 19, it's

1171
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:22,040
a cute girl mixed with a battleship, transporting three naked folicing men. You have Adam, who

1172
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:28,400
is actually Adam from the creation, who is half naked and riding on the moon. You have

1173
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:36,160
Bote, who is the guy from the first game. And Umimin, who is a latex creature that looks

1174
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:46,080
like a condom. So, yeah, interesting. We also have Chowaniki Kyukyoku Meteki Genga Saikyou

1175
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:53,520
Otoko, which translates to, um, the ultimate most strongest man in the galaxy. Or the ultimate

1176
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:58,520
invincible most galactically powerful man. And it's based off the first Chowaniki. And

1177
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:05,920
it's, uh, Ita-ten and Ben-ten from the first game. Um, yeah, it's still weird. Um, it's

1178
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:11,880
actually available for download on PlayStation Network, uh, in North America. So, get it

1179
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:17,200
and then send it to me. And then we also have the Wonder Swan version, Chowaniki Otoko no

1180
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:25,760
Tamahuda. Um, it's actually, um, I've explained what Hanafuda is before, haven't I? I think

1181
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,160
so. Nintendo started off as a Hanafuda company. It's playing cards. It's a type of playing

1182
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,840
card game. Right. Sorry, I just want to, I switched the music to the ending from the

1183
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:37,480
PC Engine version because I wanted to see it. Okay. So, sorry. It's okay. Um, but it's

1184
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:42,960
actually a portmanteau of Tamashi, which is Soul, and Hanafuda, which is a card game.

1185
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:51,320
So it's like, it could also mean balls. Tama. Balls. Anyway. Um, it was on the Wonder Swan.

1186
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:58,680
I came really close to buying this once. Then, what? You, you said something. Oh no, I was

1187
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:02,400
just, I was gonna say, you know what's funny is that, you know, obviously I know of this

1188
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,140
game because, you know, I've been doing this show for a while and how can you not know

1189
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:11,160
about this game, but, uh, I've never played it. Believe it or not. I've never played this

1190
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:17,960
game. Well, um. It looks like I just kinda look at it with a raised eyebrow going, what?

1191
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:22,640
Which I'm sure is what most people do. And it's probably the point. Okay. Well, um, the

1192
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:30,160
last, uh, one on my list is Choeiniki Senaru Protein Densetsu, which is Legend of the Holy

1193
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:36,320
Protein. Wow. And it's done by the group that did Sengoku Blade. Holy Protein? Holy Protein

1194
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:42,000
Batman. I'm just gonna read exactly what's on the article. The plot of the game centers,

1195
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,520
actually, centers on the Holy Protein, a deity-like glob of what may be semen. Samson and Adon

1196
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:56,040
hover around the glob, absorbing enemy fire as they did in the previous game. Yeah, um,

1197
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:03,960
yeah. And it has, um, a Mona Lisa painting that fires lasers from its eyes, and a giant

1198
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:10,120
cross-dressing man in a maid outfit. So yeah. Um, and then there was Choeiniki Zero, which

1199
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:17,560
came out by, um, Extreme Co. Limited, and, uh. But the whole thing with Choeiniki is

1200
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:25,680
that it's so completely freakin' nuts that you can't help but love it. I mean, there's

1201
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:31,680
actually, uh, Masaya made a game called, um, well, a series called Langrisser, which I've

1202
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:37,400
played a few of those games. Um, but Samson and all of them are in it. You have to go

1203
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:42,960
to the Muscle Shrine where you fight Samson, and then you can use the Aniki Summon. It's

1204
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,120
on the Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, and PlayStation versions, which I've played the Super Nintendo

1205
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:55,920
in. Um, Capcom game God Hand makes fun of Samson and Adon as powerless, powerless yet

1206
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:02,200
flamboyant drag queens, who are the first bosses in the game. Wow. Yeah. Um, they, uh,

1207
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:09,240
they have, uh, Samson and Adon have a weapon called Men's Beam, which is white energy from

1208
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:23,040
holes in their head. Wow. Yeah. It's just, it's gay. And I'm saying this, it's gay. Like,

1209
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:29,360
I don't really think it's gay as in homosexual, it's more like gay as in, um, Christmas. You

1210
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:34,360
know, don't we now our gay apparel? That's, that's where we're at. I think that it's full

1211
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:41,480
of penis references, and naked men in speedos, and drag queens. Uh, AlphaKananagram in our

1212
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,520
chatroom says, Sky, I tried gifting you Choe and Iki on virtual consoles. Is that what

1213
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:49,120
you talked about? I don't remember playing it. Maybe I did, and I just blocked it from

1214
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:53,960
my mind. DDRDollarBill in our chatroom says, gay isn't the word I'd use for Choe and Iki.

1215
01:30:53,960 --> 01:31:04,280
Yeah, I'm not so sure. I think I might use the word what. I want it. All right. Anyhow,

1216
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:08,200
there it is, your classic game of the week. If Dark Soccer is all finished over there,

1217
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:17,800
Choe and Iki on various systems. And honestly, Rob, after I've played, I've played like a

1218
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:25,160
couple of them. They're actually really fun. But it's so bizarre. And I just mean, you

1219
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:29,040
can't help but laugh and be happy while you're playing it. Because it's naked. Well then

1220
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:34,480
it is gay. Because gay means happy. And I wasn't meaning like. I know, I know. You know

1221
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:41,040
what I mean. I know what you mean. It's just, it was, it's gorgeous. It's like, it's, it's

1222
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:50,200
beautiful. Penis. I'm 12. I'm gonna need to crop that and play, add that to the sound

1223
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:54,120
board at some point. All right, just, just messing. All right, we're gonna take a break,

1224
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:57,720
but don't go anywhere guys. We'll be right back. Your Twitter topics, and God, you saw

1225
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,440
what came last week and what that became. So who knows what's on the Twitter this week.

1226
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:05,680
So get those in at twitter.com slash o-l-r. We're gonna also get to the mailbag and we're

1227
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:09,760
gonna talk about some other news stories. We're gonna talk about some goings-on in Xbox

1228
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,720
Live Arcade. We're gonna talk about the future of arcade games in another country. And we're

1229
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:20,340
gonna talk about a game that is being pirated that's doing something kind of lolsy. Especially

1230
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:23,760
if you're Dark Soccer, you're gonna find this pretty lolsy. So we'll be back after this

1231
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:32,560
quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1232
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:37,240
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has

1233
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:43,360
a voice. We are taping live our 392nd episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December the

1234
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:50,440
5th, right, of 2010. I lost track of time. Only 20 shopping days left. Actually no, not

1235
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:56,280
even that many. 19. Uh oh. Oh well. Anyhow, this is the part of the show where we like

1236
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:59,680
to welcome you guys back. We're gonna get into the rapid fire news in a minute. But

1237
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:04,100
I want to bring up a couple things. First, since I didn't mention shopping days and shopping

1238
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:09,440
going on, have you guys like kind of gone out and tried to brave the masses going on

1239
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,160
right now? Like I'll tell you, I was in the mall yesterday and it had nothing to do with

1240
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:16,720
shopping. Well, it did. I was getting a card for somebody. But I happen to be at the mall

1241
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:21,840
and uh, it was a madhouse. But I went into GameStop and they were having some pretty

1242
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:27,040
interesting deals. I damn near bought a copy of Borderlands for 18 bucks used. But then

1243
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:30,280
Alan was like, well, but you want to get the PC version so you can play with me. And I'm

1244
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:34,480
like, oh yeah, that's true. And you want to get the game of the year version so you can

1245
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:40,240
play Duke Nukem Forever earlier. True, but that's also more, more money. Like $18 to

1246
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,360
see if I, cause I don't know if I'm gonna like it or not. You're gonna love it. Seriously.

1247
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,040
You think? All right, we'll see. We'll see. But then I'm also like, well shit, Cataclysm

1248
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:52,400
is coming out this week. Or you could borrow my copy. I like that idea. Well then also

1249
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,880
there's always the whole like, I could just play it on Alan's computer, but we always

1250
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:00,340
get distracted because like, oh, but we really need to run a raid and wow, oh boy, we really

1251
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:06,120
need to go out and drink or whatever we're doing. So anyhow, I have either of you guys

1252
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:12,480
been to the stores and looked at deals? Well, I didn't specifically go shopping. Um, when

1253
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:17,560
Marissa was here, we went over to the Arden Fair Mall. Ooh. And we just walked and looked

1254
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:24,600
at stuff and I popped into Forever 21 and looked at jackets cause I liked some of the

1255
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,160
clothes there. I wouldn't wear all of it, but I liked some of it. Was that a freaking

1256
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:30,640
mad house though? Like the rest of the malls seem to be? Yeah, it was kind of crazy, but

1257
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:34,840
not so bad. I mean, I went into, you see, wait, wait, I did buy something. Oh, it's

1258
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:40,920
not in here. I bought this gorgeously obnoxious leopard print purse at Claire's. I remember

1259
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:47,040
you for $5 cause you're a 12 year old girl. Yes. It was cute. Shut up. So I bought, I

1260
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:51,280
bought a leopard print purse cause I thought it was cute and adorable and I like, I like

1261
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:56,720
stuff. I'm a girl. Loud. Just cause I'm wearing pyramid head today doesn't mean I'm not going

1262
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,920
to be fashionable tomorrow. First I thought you were looking down cause you said I'm a

1263
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:01,960
girl and then he kind of looked down like as if you were checking your breasts to make

1264
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:07,400
sure they were still there. Look how I bounce. But you were looking at pyramid head on your

1265
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:15,280
shirt. All right. P Hiddy. All right. Special to me. Tons of kids at the mall too. Oh my

1266
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:22,960
God. Kids everywhere at the mall. Oof. And I went to target boy. It's, that's an even

1267
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,440
bigger mad house. Anyway, I won't bore you with that. What I will bore you with is a

1268
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:30,760
talk about our spinoff shows. If you like orange lounge radio, why don't you take a

1269
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:37,080
minute to check out our spinoff shows. Dark Sakura. She does a podcast called comic insanity.

1270
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:43,120
It's all about comics and it's with her buddies Tiara and Dan shadow and it's every Tuesday

1271
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,960
and you can find it on itunes. And this all this month we'll be having a special, which

1272
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,400
is our year end review of comics. Oh boy. So now you know what you got to catch up on.

1273
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:54,600
You get to see how much we are, you know, PO'd with Matt fraction. All right. Now do

1274
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:59,000
you remember the show? I do. I plugged your show. You remember my show? The one with Dolly

1275
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:05,880
Parton and her boobs. Oh, sorry. It's best little hoard house in whatever fucking planet

1276
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:12,760
that is. Azeroth. Yes. Azeroth. Yeah. Okay. But yeah, it's there. You're cute. You and

1277
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:16,800
you and extra for, you're adorable. We had a fun show this week. Actually. We had a special

1278
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,400
guest. A frat. Matt is what I call him online, but a grandpa Warcraft is what we were calling

1279
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:25,360
him because he's been playing and you know, Matt, he's been playing a Warcraft since vanilla.

1280
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,900
So we were calling grandpa Warcraft. It was a good show. Wow. So I have absolutely no

1281
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:34,480
idea what that means. He's old and he plays Warcraft. That's what it means. Uh, and also,

1282
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:39,280
uh, we have a huge show plan. That's not really, we're just doing the same old show, but it

1283
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:43,640
is cataclysm. The third expansion of wow does come out this week. It's a pretty big deal.

1284
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:51,320
So we're going to go plans versus zombies. Yeah. The sad thing is it goes live at midnight

1285
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:56,520
tomorrow and I got to go to bed cause of work. I can't stay up and play wow. And then Tuesday

1286
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:00,600
I have to go bake cookies cause there's this whole cookie party. Yes. There is a cookie

1287
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:10,400
party going on at work. That's why the show got canceled. That was the best part of the

1288
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:15,560
Sarah Silverman show was cookie party with what was the host name? Miss something on

1289
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:20,160
cookie party. Forget it. All the listeners at home are like, I thought this was a video

1290
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:27,120
game podcast. Anyhow, let's do some rapid fire news and remind them that it is a game

1291
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,760
podcast. Uh, Loki, what do you got for us? By the way, Twitter last chance, twitter.com

1292
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:36,560
slash O L R for Twitter topics tonight. Yes. Uh, cool stuff. Uh, you may remember that

1293
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:43,600
Ghostbusters a game that came out almost a year and a half ago. Um, there is a few achievements

1294
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:49,840
that were unable to be achieved, I guess, because the game was broken and uh, well apparently

1295
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:56,960
they have actually, um, just, uh, put through Xbox live certification, the, uh, update that

1296
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:03,320
will fix those. And, um, I guess these now four achievements that were unable to be unlocked

1297
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:08,820
before, um, are being fixed. So that's kind of cool that they're actually still working

1298
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:14,900
on patches for games despite the fact that they came out long time ago. So, um, neat.

1299
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:18,880
And then of course if you're a fan of Ghostbusters, you'll be happy to know that Ghostbusters sanctum

1300
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:25,720
of slime will be coming to Xbox live arcade and PlayStation network and PC next spring.

1301
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:30,400
And the game is a little bit different than the one that was on Xbox 360 and PlayStation

1302
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:36,760
three, uh, previously from terminal reality. Uh, this is actually going to be, um, kind

1303
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:43,280
of a top down action game. And they're saying that it's being developed by the assault heroes

1304
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:50,120
creator, uh, one echo and it's a four player online and a co you know, local co-op, a top

1305
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:54,520
down action game that's gonna not really have any of the voice actors because you know,

1306
01:38:54,520 --> 01:39:00,660
they're expensive and um, they're not really sure if, uh, you know, the characters from

1307
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:04,060
the movie obviously are going to be there or they're going to be replaced by a new team

1308
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:10,720
or something like that. Um, but yeah, it's a pretty awesome looking actually from some

1309
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:17,000
of the screenshots that they had. So that'll be coming sometime soon next year. Uh, game

1310
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,840
loft is announcing some new games. They actually had some pretty decent ones when they're not

1311
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:29,380
ripping off other games. Um, nice. Like I worked that in there. Uh, Nova two, it's their

1312
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:34,520
first person shooter game. That's kind of a little bit like halo. It's inspired, I guess

1313
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:38,000
if you will, but it's actually pretty solid. I thought you said they weren't ripping off

1314
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:43,400
other games anymore. It's a sci fi shooter. Okay. So you know, whatever. All right. But

1315
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:47,240
it's actually pretty cool. Um, it adds new weapons, new enemies and uh, the new enemies

1316
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:53,000
of course have jet packs and uh, we'll offer a multiplayer and I guess it, uh, continues

1317
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,400
the story of the first game. Uh, but I guess people that have the original wall so get

1318
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:02,560
rewarded different, uh, with some bonus XP. And then they have shadow guardian, which

1319
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:08,400
is a new IP for game loft and it's kind of similar to like an uncharted or tomb Raider

1320
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:15,960
game. It's more of like a, an action, um, adventure game. So, uh, it looks very uncharted

1321
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:22,720
esque, but um, you know, nice to see some sophisticated games coming to iOS despite

1322
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:26,640
the fact game office really hit or miss with some of this stuff. But, um, yeah, the original

1323
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:31,840
IP stuff's not bad. You know, they're gang star or whatever. Um, it's not a bad clone

1324
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:42,400
of like the old PSP or PlayStation two grand theft auto games. And then, um, let's see,

1325
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:48,960
Def Jam. Uh, this is kind of interesting in the UK. Uh, Def Jam is, um, do their rap star

1326
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:56,000
game. They're having a competition that offers the winner, um, a record contract. Apparently,

1327
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:02,640
um, they're going to be teaming up, I guess, with Atlantic records, UK, and they're giving

1328
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:09,600
a one lucky UK resident chance to, um, have their very own record. And they're going to

1329
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:15,440
be employing the game's freestyle mode and contestants will upload their hottest, um,

1330
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:20,680
40 bars, uh, give or take. And they're going to be judged by the Def Jam rap star community

1331
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:26,280
because they do have a really big, uh, community aspect to the game, actually, despite the

1332
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:29,480
fact that a lot of people don't. I had a chance to get this game. I was going to get it for

1333
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:35,800
just the microphone, you know, cause I got it for free. I actually passed. Wow. It wasn't

1334
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:40,240
a bad game. I mean, I don't listen to really the, I mean, maybe there's a couple songs

1335
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:45,320
in there. I know, but it's not the type of game. I can't see myself honestly playing

1336
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:49,760
this game. Especially I live by myself and a lot of my gaming is alone, so I just can't

1337
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:57,320
see myself, you know, sitting there, you know, rapping by myself in my apartment. I mean,

1338
01:41:57,320 --> 01:42:04,760
there's just something kind of sad. I'm crying all night today cause I just watched a sad

1339
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:12,920
movie. I'll play Def Jam rap star to make me feel better. Sip it on gin and juice. Uh,

1340
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:18,100
it says the top regional finalists will then have to compete in front of a live audience

1341
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:24,240
at the UK HMV, um, locations. Uh, they're saying eight mile style and that's going to

1342
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:32,360
be in February. And of course that means that the winner, um, will be able to have the actual,

1343
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:38,080
um, you know, record contract. See, Loki, you should be participating in this. That's

1344
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:45,720
why you need the game. Yes. I bet anything. If you last night, I don't believe that Sacramento

1345
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:53,480
is in the UK. Uh, you know, my basic geography knowledge says that's not correct. We need

1346
01:42:53,480 --> 01:43:03,160
to fix this. Just Kidman rap. What do we know to do it? Who else is in the UK? How about

1347
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:11,920
Aki Ripper? Let's get Aki Ripper. Does Sweden count? Sweden? I don't know. We need to find

1348
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:20,960
that out. All right. Anyhow, uh, yeah, I have some news, but whatever. It's just not as

1349
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:26,480
cool as Swedish rap. A rock band reloaded is now available on the iOS systems, meaning

1350
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:32,160
the iPhone, the iPod touch, the iPad. It's five bucks on the phones and phone with no

1351
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:38,240
phone and $10 on the iPad. There's a new expert mode and apparently full vocal support. So

1352
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:43,880
you could actually sit there and, you know, sing along with your phone. Uh, also the iPad

1353
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:48,400
version now has split screen multiplayer and several different ways to have the action

1354
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:53,040
on screen. You can reorient gameplay if you're a lefty. That's kind of cool. And apparently

1355
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:56,360
there's a whole drum kit now that you can kind of have so you can kind of beat your

1356
01:43:56,360 --> 01:44:02,440
iPad. I guess that's how it works. Kind of neat. Uh, there are quite a few games available

1357
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:06,800
when you initially download it, including a kryptonite three doors down. So what you

1358
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:12,320
want by Beastie Boys, White Wedding by Billy Idol. God, I love that song. Uh, Call Me When

1359
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:16,920
You're Sober by Evanescence. The Perfect Drug by Nine Inch Nails. Uh, Hella Good by No Doubt.

1360
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:21,280
I mean, a lot of these games are sort of in, uh, the rock band game anyway. There's also

1361
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:26,360
tracks that you can download in the music store. I guess there's some free tracks too

1362
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:29,920
in the music store. Of course they're like indie bands and stuff, but the acrobats are

1363
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:35,840
in there. Daylight and Dollar Short if you like the acrobats. Uh, a lot of people around

1364
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:40,560
the internets were fans of Splosion Man. Remember that game that was on the indie marketplace?

1365
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:46,280
Well, guess what? A sequel has been announced. Ms. Splosion Man. I know they're doing like

1366
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:50,280
the whole Ms. Pac-Man thing, but seriously, they could have done Splosion Woman. I know.

1367
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:56,080
I was gonna say, wouldn't that be Ms. Splosion Woman? Or maybe this is like a drag queen.

1368
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:00,960
I don't know, but whatever. Uh, Ms. Splosion Man, whatever gender he or she happens to

1369
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:07,240
be, is planned to come out in the fall of 2011. This is a really early announcement,

1370
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:14,000
but there it is. Uh, the CCO Josh Baer of Twisted Pixel has said, quote, we could have

1371
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,160
churned out new levels for Splosion Man, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new

1372
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:22,520
gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff. But we didn't want to just do Splosion Man

1373
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:28,340
2. It had to be something a little more interesting. That is why we're making Ms. Splosion Man.

1374
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:32,200
There's actually a teaser trailer that's out there and everything, and as you can expect,

1375
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:39,560
it pays homage to Ms. Pac-Man. World of Warcraft news, but not the kind that gets me excited.

1376
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:45,640
Sorry, DarkSakura. World of Warcraft apparently is now streaming and playable on an HTC Desire.

1377
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:51,680
Yeah, it's this whole little tech demo that was out there before. It's now been fully

1378
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:57,320
realized apparently. An HTC Desire smartphone is running World of Warcraft, and I don't

1379
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:01,180
know if it's like a streaming thing or what, but there's actually a demo that's out there

1380
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:05,860
on YouTube. Um, I think it is a streaming thing that they're doing with this device

1381
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:10,120
because they say you can do just about any game. And, uh, yep, they're playing World

1382
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:16,960
of Warcraft. And, I mean, do we really need that on the phone? I just, it looks like it's

1383
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:22,600
a pain in the ass to play, quite frankly. Whatever. I guess some people will be into

1384
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:29,160
that. DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Well, we have a few things. Um, to, uh, start

1385
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:36,360
us off with, uh, some Kirby. How about Kirby? Kirby's Epic Yarn will be out in 2011 for

1386
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:43,880
our European friends, out on February 25th. I was trying to say 25th. It'll be 25th. So,

1387
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:51,320
uh, you have to wait, but it's gonna be, uh, all cool. They have to change, you know, in

1388
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:56,640
British English, I guess, so that it can be, you know, a duvet instead of a comforter,

1389
01:46:56,640 --> 01:47:01,680
and a lift instead of an elevator, and, uh, a boot instead of the trunk. You know, that

1390
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:09,480
type of thing. And, uh, new, uh, characters for Super Street Fighter IV, we have Dun-dun-dun,

1391
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:16,080
didn't we call it last, uh, last week? Oni Akuma, who is like Shin Akuma, who is the super

1392
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:23,360
evil one. And then we have Evil Ryu. Rrrrr. So that's gonna be super hot, cause I loved

1393
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:30,840
Evil Ryu. Of course, I would love to have Evil Sakura next. Dark Sakura. Ooh. And then,

1394
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:37,520
for Rock Band, more download content, we get Queen! Finally, finally, finally. Um, it's,

1395
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:44,720
uh, Rock Band 3, um, upgraded tracks from Lego Rock Band. Um, so here's what's, uh,

1396
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:50,840
also gonna be in the Queen Extravaganza Pack 1. Hammer to Fall, Keep Yourself Alive, Now

1397
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:55,720
I'm Here, Play the Game, Tenement Funster, We Are the Champions, We Will Rock You, and

1398
01:47:55,720 --> 01:48:02,480
the Rock Band 3 Enhanced Pack, I Want It All, I Want to Break Free, Killer Queen, One Vision,

1399
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:07,520
Somebody to Love, and Under Pressure. I am so buying. Which also is David Bowie. I am

1400
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:11,600
so buying that Enhanced Pack. So am I. The, uh, first pack is a lot of really, kind of

1401
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,560
like, off-cut tracks, which, I mean, Queen is Queen, they're cool. With these, they threw

1402
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:19,760
two big ones in there to kinda, uh, make it feel a little more valuable, but, uh, I definitely

1403
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:25,000
want, like, all my favorite Queen songs are in that other pack, so. And for some reason,

1404
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,840
this is weird, I never bought the Queen track pack in Rock Band originally. Like, I just

1405
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:32,520
somehow missed it, or I wasn't playing Rock Band at the time. Like, there's already, like,

1406
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:37,480
fifteen Queen songs available in there. And, I really need to get Sing Star Queen at some

1407
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:41,400
point, cause I'm sure I can find it really cheap now. Just like Sing Star Abba is on,

1408
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:46,120
like, every Target clearance rack. Really need to get Sing Star Queen. Going to our

1409
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:50,160
chatroom at chat.orangelaungerady.com, there's some comments, uh, SSJ100Matt is talking about

1410
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:55,080
Ms. Splosion Man. Ms. Splosion Man better have her making a sandwich in the end. Just

1411
01:48:55,080 --> 01:49:02,400
sayin'. Tigerclaw says, the third one should be Junior Explosion Man, or Baby Splosion

1412
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:10,500
Man. Here you go. I don't know about explosion baby. Chat.orangelaungerady.com. I think there's

1413
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:14,880
an indie game on the marketplace that is about, like, exploding babies, uh, that might be

1414
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:20,600
what you're thinking of, I don't know. Hey, let's go to the tweeter! Twitter.com slash

1415
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:32,660
O-L-R. Uh, SSJ100Matt is sending us a story courtesy of Travis Donovan. South Korea is

1416
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:38,240
getting ready to set an internet curfew for young teens. Really, I had not heard about

1417
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:43,920
this, but then again I did not listen to, um, USL last night, I was a very, er, on,

1418
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:49,240
yeah, on Saturday night, I was a very naughty boy, I was out. Uh, but apparently South Korea,

1419
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:52,480
although I notice I'm being linked to a story from Fox News, so take it from it with a grain

1420
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:59,400
of salt. South Korea is, uh, apparently considering a nationally enforced gaming curfew, uh, in

1421
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:04,080
an effort to, um, curb internet addiction. Cause you know a lot of times we've had those

1422
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:09,240
crazy internet addicts story and they all seem to be out of South Korea. Well apparently

1423
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:14,480
it will make it illegal for internet service providers if this bill is passed to give online

1424
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:21,420
gaming access to users under the age of 16 between the hours of midnight and 6 AM. For

1425
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:25,560
South Korean students this will mean no gaming at all. It's normal to be in school until

1426
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:32,640
midnight due to extracurricular activities and studying. What? Wow. That, that, that

1427
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:37,520
much study is actually pretty normal. Wow, makes me feel like a lazy asshole even though

1428
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:41,440
I was doing like every extracurricular activity in high school, I was still home by seven

1429
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:49,040
or eight o'clock. Dang. Alright, well, interesting. What do you guys think about this ban? They

1430
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,800
would never get away with something like that here in the US, that's for sure. It's not

1431
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,120
the government's responsibility. It's the parent's responsibility. If they're not doing

1432
01:50:55,120 --> 01:51:02,040
their job then it's... I agree. Nope, I agree 100%. It's not, not the government's responsibility

1433
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:08,120
but whatever. Alright, moving on. Dark Tetsuya on Twitter wants to remind us of this and

1434
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:12,080
yes this is something I definitely need to plug and we'll probably be plugging a little

1435
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:19,320
more as we hit the deadline here but the USL-OLR Madness, this used to be called March Madness

1436
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:23,680
but I guess they moved it from March. 2011 is now open for nominations. This is something

1437
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:27,760
a little more that our buddies at Under Station Live do and they really involve themselves

1438
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:32,520
with but we like to support it here at OLR and I know I have already submitted my list.

1439
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:38,960
Now if you don't know what this is, it's basically a competition a la March Madness, the NCAA

1440
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:45,740
competition to choose the greatest game ever. Now this game has changed from year to year.

1441
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:51,100
I believe last year Chrono Trigger finally won which why I don't know, so many people

1442
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:55,320
wank about that game. It's not that great people but Super Metroid has won previously

1443
01:51:55,320 --> 01:52:00,700
which I completely understand and support. Super Mario Brothers 3 has won before which

1444
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:06,340
okay yeah Mario, Mario games got to win at some point. So who will win this year? IDK

1445
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:12,140
but you need to submit your top 25 list to uslmadness at gmail.com. Now the deadline

1446
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:18,300
is January 3rd, 2011 so you have a little while but don't procrastinate. Please don't

1447
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:22,300
procrastinate. I've already sent my list in and you should send yours in too. Send it

1448
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:26,620
in order from 1 to 25. More details available on our website at orangelandsradio.com and

1449
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:30,900
I imagine it's available at Understation Live's website as well. They are live every Saturday

1450
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:36,380
night right here at All Games Radio. We're going to some tweets from Spazinator. I agree

1451
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:43,220
with Jamie's thoughts on Choniki. I got the PS1 and to say that it's weird and or gay

1452
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:48,380
is an understatement. It's like saying water is wet. First it was a novelty for me but

1453
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:53,740
once the novelty wore off I forgot about it. As long as you mean gay meaning happy I'm

1454
01:52:53,740 --> 01:53:01,660
okay with that. Well I mean it's full of homoerotic imagery. It is, it is but I just you know

1455
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:07,980
whatever. And you know me I never use the word gay to mean anything. I know, I know.

1456
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:14,380
I mean penis. But anyway there's a lot of games like that though where like once the

1457
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:19,180
novelty wore off it's kind of over. There's sadly too many games like that out there but

1458
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:24,000
whatever. Anyhow Tiger Claw sends us a variety of tweets. I seem to remember there's a two

1459
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,520
tweet limit but I'm feeling generous and I had beer before the show tonight so I'm going

1460
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:33,780
to let him have all three tonight because I'm kind and generous. First off the Toronto

1461
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:41,020
Police recover half a million dollars in stolen Sony goods. They are on it up there in Canada.

1462
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:45,940
The 39 year old man in Toronto was arrested for stealing half a million dollars. We're

1463
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:50,180
assuming of course that's Canadian. I don't know because they call it dollars too. PlayStation

1464
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:56,820
3's, PSP's and games. Apparently this was due to tractor trailers that were stolen on

1465
01:53:56,820 --> 01:54:01,660
November 15th and 16th in Brampton. These trailers had about half a million dollars

1466
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:07,820
in PS3's, PSP's and video games. That's where all the Sony stuff went in Canada. Well the

1467
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:15,740
39 year old was arrested and will be in court on January 10th of 2011. Tiger Claw also sends

1468
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:21,220
us a link. Standalone motion sensing game console believes honesty is the best policy.

1469
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:25,740
This is linked to a story on Joystiq. What is this all about? Apparently it's a knock

1470
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:33,100
off of the Nintendo Wii. There's a system now called the Wireless 60 and there's a description

1471
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:39,000
on the back of the box. This is great. The description on the back of the box says, if

1472
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,860
you are looking to purchase or own an Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Wii or equivalent, this

1473
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:50,960
product does not compare or compete with these technologies. Well that's, that's awfully

1474
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:55,760
upfront and endearing. Thank you. Thank you for being honest. But I love that it is in

1475
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:59,440
small print on the back. If you're looking for a Nintendo Wii or, but you know what?

1476
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:05,460
These might not be what you wanted. Just, just saying. But if you want the golf kit

1477
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:12,700
and the ping pong kit, this is the system for you. How much is one of these? They're

1478
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:17,140
probably cheap. I don't know. Some of these games probably aren't much worse than a bunch

1479
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:20,580
of the crap on the Wii honestly. You might be selling yourself short a little bit there

1480
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:32,860
Wireless 60. I love the name too. It's just shy of being Wii 60. Think about it. And lastly

1481
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:37,740
from Tigerclaw in our last tweet tonight at twitter.com slash o-l-r, people really did

1482
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:45,760
buy Donkey Kong with bananas. Do you remember that there was this whole promo with the UK

1483
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:51,860
gamers and the UK could actually buy the game with bananas? Yes. Apparently there were some

1484
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:57,980
folks that actually braved the cold weather and 20 people walked away with the game having

1485
01:55:57,980 --> 01:56:06,940
paid for them in bananas. How many bananas? It just said a bunch of bananas. So we don't

1486
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:12,340
know exactly how many but it was the first 20 people in line to give a bunch of bananas.

1487
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:17,180
Sounds like a fun promo. And then all the staff's like what the fuck are we gonna do

1488
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:22,540
with these bananas? It's basically a eat em! Dude, bananas are great. It's basically a

1489
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:26,460
Black Friday-esque type of promotion. I mean Old Navy gave away Dance Central to like the

1490
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:31,900
first few people in line right? So I mean you know that's not completely unheard of.

1491
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:36,260
Alright that's gonna do it for Twitter topics tonight. Twitter.com slash o-l-r. In the meantime

1492
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:46,140
back to more gaming news. Loki. Yes. So you know with, they had kind of an indie launch

1493
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:55,060
thing for the Xbox Marketplace. Well now there's kind of the Microsoft Game Studios promotion

1494
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:59,420
that they're doing for Xbox Marketplace and of course they have three games coming out

1495
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:05,940
for the games for the holidays presented by Microsoft Game Studios. And these three games

1496
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:12,620
would be including World of Keflings which does have avatar support in it. Rascals and

1497
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:21,700
Elo Meelo. Even though Elo Meelo you can get it now if you know how. So each, looks like

1498
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:32,580
they're gonna be 800 Microsoft points each or $10. And Elo Meelo of course is on Xbox

1499
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:36,660
Live right now. There is a way to do that. Or you can wait to the official release which

1500
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:43,540
is January 5th. And then of course. Now why would I want to wait? Exactly. Who wants to

1501
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:51,940
wait? World of Keflings. That is kind of a puzzle slash racer mashup game. And that's

1502
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:59,180
gonna be, I'm sorry, the puzzle racer is Rascals and that's gonna be coming out on 29th. World

1503
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:04,460
of Keflings will be on the 22nd. Like I said those are each gonna be 800 Microsoft points

1504
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:10,380
or $10. And of course if you buy more than one there's some bonuses that you get with

1505
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:16,180
that. Not necessarily money back but some neat stuff anyways. You get cross unlockables

1506
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:22,300
for each game. For example in Elo Meelo if you, you can get an unlockable Keflings or

1507
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:28,460
Rascal costume for Elo or Meelo by purchasing the other games. Additionally you can also

1508
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:35,860
unlock Elo and Doug as playable characters in Rascals. And you can also unlock Rascal

1509
01:58:35,860 --> 01:58:43,260
characters within Elo Meelo and World of Keflings by purchasing the full range of games as well.

1510
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:53,460
Even crazier it says you can get Rascals early by buying World of Keflings. Rascals can be

1511
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:59,420
bought from within that game a week before it's released on the 29th. Okay I have to

1512
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:03,780
draw a map to follow all that but fine. So basically all these games are giving each

1513
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:07,340
other the reach around essentially. Pretty much. Interesting. It's a throwaway reach

1514
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:11,260
around. I kinda like that idea. I mean even though none of these games are things I'm

1515
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:14,620
particularly excited about. I guess you never know though. I mean like I didn't think I'd

1516
01:59:14,620 --> 01:59:21,160
be excited about Super Meat Boy and it's pretty awesome. It's a neat promotion and very different

1517
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:26,420
from what the summer one where it's just like buy X number of games, get points. You know

1518
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:31,380
what I mean? Like I kinda like the idea they've got going on here a little better. So that's

1519
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:35,620
kinda cool. I like the way the games are interacting with each other. Do you have any interest

1520
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:41,660
in any of these games, Loki? Rascals kinda sounds neat. Uh, Elo and Meelo look kind of

1521
01:59:41,660 --> 01:59:49,340
cool. Uh, I never played Kingdom of Keflings so hmm. I know I never played Kingdom of Keflings

1522
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:52,300
either but apparently it's pretty popular. But I thought it was only popular because

1523
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:59,060
of the Avatar thing. But I don't know. Alright well moving on to a game I am really looking

1524
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:02,300
forward to and I was very disappointed it didn't make this Christmas but whatever. It'll

1525
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:08,780
come out soon enough when it's ready. Little Big Planet 2 is on its way pretty soon and

1526
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:12,660
there's a beta going on right now. Now there's an update that happened on the PlayStation

1527
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:17,880
blog where the marketing manager at Sony Computer Entertainment America talked through a tutorial

1528
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:24,300
how you can record voices in the game and assign them to characters. Oh my gosh that

1529
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:28,780
looks awesome. I can't play the whole video here because there's a lot to it but uh, yeah

1530
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:33,700
apparently there's these whole little like pins that you can get in the game and you

1531
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:37,500
can go through tutorials and one of the things you get to do, I'm trying to find where it

1532
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:41,380
is in the video I probably won't get it here live on air, but you can actually record voices.

1533
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:47,900
That is awesome. So we could actually do an OLR level voiced with OLR characters. That

1534
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:51,700
would be kind of fun. We can be little sack boys and girls. Yes we could. We should also

1535
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:54,580
get Marissa to do voice acting for us. We should definitely get Marissa to do voice

1536
02:00:54,580 --> 02:01:01,420
acting for us and I think she needs a sack girl that you know has very large sacks. Marissa

1537
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:08,060
needs to create UTA. I love Marissa I wish I was able to see her when I was in LA. But

1538
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:12,380
yeah that's awesome. I'm so looking forward to this game. You know what though? Creating

1539
02:01:12,380 --> 02:01:16,540
levels in LittleBigPlanet 1 was hard enough. I can't imagine how hard it's going to be

1540
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:22,020
in version 2. But I'm very excited about this. I hope you guys are too. Loki will you be

1541
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:28,860
doing some voice acting for a level in LittleBigPlanet? I can I guess. AlphaCananagram says this is

1542
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:33,280
old news. Whatever it's new to me I'm not in the beta. I haven't been following the

1543
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:39,340
news as closely as I should. Yes and Tigerclaw reminds us as well. I thought this on last

1544
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:45,460
week's show but maybe not. LittleBigPlanet 2 has no 3D support. There will not be 3D

1545
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:54,680
in LittleBigPlanet 2. And to that I say thank you. It is not necessary. There you go. Those

1546
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:57,660
comments from chat.orangelaundry.com. It's just something that they're really pushing

1547
02:01:57,660 --> 02:02:01,700
but yeah you're right it's not necessary because they haven't figured out how to do it correctly

1548
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:08,060
without making the gameplay suffer. Izaminar Chatroom says I think the phrase you're looking

1549
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:14,100
for is heavy baggage. Thank you. Alright let's go to DarkSakura with another news story.

1550
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:20,180
Hey the mailbag is not that far away just so you know. DarkSakura? Sega is well they're

1551
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:28,140
looking to expand back into the arcade market but not in Japan. Not in the US but in China.

1552
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:32,380
But as being the second largest economy in the world, China seems like it's going to

1553
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:38,220
be a prime market for video games. Especially arcade based games. And so they're actually

1554
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:45,040
taking games like Outrun and Virtua Fighter and doing new versions of them in China. It

1555
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:54,460
makes sense but I'm really not sure. What do you think Rob? I don't know. I mean I don't

1556
02:02:54,460 --> 02:03:04,220
live in that country so it's hard for me to say what kind of culture it is but I hate

1557
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:08,780
that arcades are dying here and then but at the same token when was the last time I went

1558
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:12,140
to one? It's been a long time. But the reason why I don't go to them is that there's not

1559
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:16,540
a lot of serious arcades here anymore you know. So I think if they're doing it kind

1560
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:21,180
of more seriously in Japan and China which makes sense because the internet cafe culture

1561
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:25,900
it's much bigger there too than it is here. Like there aren't really internet cafes here

1562
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:31,180
anymore I mean there's there's one or two especially in the Chinatowns and Koreatowns

1563
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:37,980
like the biggest one I can think of is in Koreatown in LA. But cyber cafes to us are

1564
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:42,740
like Starbucks where you bring your laptop and use the Wi-Fi. Yeah that's what I was

1565
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:49,620
like and there's so many neat cafes like especially in Japan I want to go to the cat cafes. But

1566
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:56,140
I think it's to encourage a more social aspect yet still you know it offers a service with

1567
02:03:56,140 --> 02:04:00,300
it. Some of those social games were the best though and it is kind of a bummer that Xbox

1568
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:06,240
Live sort of took that and made it not needing to go to your arcade. Like the best example

1569
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:10,140
I can think of is when Soul Calibur 2 was in the arcades and it had that mode where

1570
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:14,460
you you had your own fighter and the arcade machine would start to kind of memorize how

1571
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:19,660
you play and then you could fight other people to take over the kingdom and remember that

1572
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:22,980
whole little mode that was awesome. Conquest mode. Yeah the conquest mode. And I remember

1573
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:26,220
it wasn't in the home version. I remember we'd come up against each other's and go oh

1574
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:32,320
my god that's exactly how you play. Remember? Yes. And like even one time where I was playing

1575
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:36,860
I think on somebody I was finishing someone else's game and played my own. Played my own

1576
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:44,020
person was like damn I'm a cheap bitch. Or remember. Ice Calique. Something near and

1577
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:48,500
dear to our hearts. Remember when DDR Max 2 was in the arcades and had the community

1578
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:52,820
unlocks where the more you played the faster you'd be able to unlock stuff. That was always

1579
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:57,740
kind of neat I think. So. And we would keep being and figuring out which one was next

1580
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:01,980
and follow the pattern. And how the pattern was working and how many points and I remember

1581
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:05,700
we would be there for some of the unlocks it was like oh my god we got an unlock. We'd

1582
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:11,900
take pictures and stuff. It's Santa Morete. Alright anyhow. And then Max 300 what's this

1583
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:18,380
crap? The hell is this? So yeah I think it's cool. I hope maybe some of the ideas used

1584
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:23,100
in China and Japan they can figure out how to make them work in the US but I'm not gonna

1585
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:27,620
hold my breath cause I think the US is just a bunch of gambling for kids. These ticket

1586
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:34,340
spitting machines. Anyhow. Loki do you have better news for us? Ticket spitting machines?

1587
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:41,180
Yeah. No I'm afraid I don't. But you know there's a lot of those redemption machines

1588
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:47,340
that they have in some of those arcades over there in China and Japan that you know dole

1589
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:54,420
out DS's and stuff. But this has nothing to do with that unfortunately because it's Wii

1590
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:59,020
peripheral and I'd be very disappointed to win it in one of those machines. The Wii Speak

1591
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:05,220
Microphone. Yeah it came out with Animal Crossing, City Folk and they're like oh yeah you can

1592
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:10,460
chat with other people and hey that's you know it's awesome technology to be able to

1593
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:13,500
chat with other players when you're playing games you know something that's standard with

1594
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:19,580
say the Xbox and Playstation 3 which is why we need to get rid of it. And that's sadly

1595
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:27,140
what's happening. The Wii Speak peripheral is now limited at retail locations and additional

1596
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:32,920
shipments I guess can be made if consumer demand increases according to Nintendo but

1597
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:41,020
other than that they are no longer producing those for retail. Not to say that games won't

1598
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:46,620
still support it but it's kind of sad. Especially since they don't really have any sort of like

1599
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:55,220
headset options or anything like that for the Wii. I don't know.

1600
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:59,140
Yeah I mean the Wii's kind of had to catch up in some ways even though Reggie doesn't

1601
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:02,020
want you to think that. I mean in some ways they had to really catch up to some of the

1602
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:08,540
technology at the 360 and the PS3 was doing but it didn't work in this case and I think

1603
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:12,660
part of it was that they'll throw out these peripherals and Nintendo's done this a few

1604
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:16,680
times they'll throw out these peripherals and then not really support them. Like there's

1605
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:21,140
one or two games that support it and then that's it. Like the balance board in some

1606
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:26,580
ways is a bit of anomaly. Like if it didn't have this damn good A plus game behind it

1607
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:31,900
like I think the balance board would be added to the list of stuff that like Wii Speak.

1608
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:37,700
But Wii Speak was for what? A game on the Wii that honestly and I hate to say this wasn't

1609
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:42,600
very good because we'd seen it before. I mean if there hadn't been two other Animal Crossing

1610
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:48,500
games already then the Wii version would have been awesome but that wasn't the case. So

1611
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:55,660
and then what else used Wii Speak? Nothing. Nothing. So and it's not like the Wii is known

1612
02:07:55,660 --> 02:08:01,700
for its online gaming capabilities where Wii Speak would come into play so it was kind

1613
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:10,500
of useless. So it's unfortunate. Some folks in our chat room at chat.orangelandradi.com

1614
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:17,300
I'm going to say this name again and butcher it I'm sorry. Maginomicon says yeah that was

1615
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:21,820
a total waste of my money and to be fair there wasn't a better offer on the PS2 a better

1616
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:26,900
showing. I guess that's one way to look at it. And then AlphaCananagram in our chat room

1617
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:32,100
says seriously why isn't the Wii Speak hacked already for the PC? That's a good question.

1618
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:38,460
Maybe nobody cared. Because you can just plug a microphone into the PC and there you go.

1619
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:45,140
Oh yeah and Maginomicon also says what about the broadband adapter for the GameCube? Oh

1620
02:08:45,140 --> 02:08:50,340
my god talk about a peripheral that really went wrong. That could have been an awesome

1621
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:53,580
must have peripheral and the Phantasy Star game on GameCube was actually really awesome

1622
02:08:53,580 --> 02:08:59,380
too. Yes it was. It was Phantasy Star Online. And it's a bummer that Sega made it because

1623
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:08,740
Nintendo just didn't care. Yeah. Nintendo hates Sega confirmed. Alright one other story

1624
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:14,700
I have for you guys before we get to the mailbag at mailbag.orangelandradi.com. Hey! Maginomicon

1625
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:22,100
says I pronounced his name right. Woohoo! Woohoo! I know I feel like I should play the

1626
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:33,060
level up music. You alright over there? I was singing the level up music for you. This

1627
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:38,900
is news about Game Center on the iPhone and iPod and iPad and honestly I'm kind of looking

1628
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:42,820
at this going who gives a shit about Game Center but I guess some folks in the gaming

1629
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:47,060
blogs are trying to say hey Apple's getting away with what Blizzard couldn't get away

1630
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:52,500
with and that is using real names. Apple made an update to the terms of service on Game

1631
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:58,000
Center this week saying that they will now use your real name when you send a friend

1632
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,380
request or reply. So if you're going to add someone on Game Center you better be prepared

1633
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:07,340
for them to see your real name. Now the rest of Game Center will not show the name and

1634
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:10,100
if you already have people friended on Game Center they're not going to be able to see

1635
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:16,460
your name. They will see your user handle and that's it. And by the way the terms of

1636
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:22,580
service also say that users must not pretend to be anyone or any entity they are not. But

1637
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:27,540
this is not hitting that same kind of pushback that Real ID did. Here's the thing though

1638
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:31,900
and I think a point that the game blogs are missing is that there were two big problems

1639
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:38,500
with Real ID that I don't see as a problem in Game Center. Number one, Blizzard was threatening

1640
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:43,900
to put real names on their forums and fine don't post in the forums except for the fact

1641
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:49,260
that Blizzard will direct you to their forums to report bugs and things. So it was a little

1642
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:53,580
bit of a catch-22 whereas we want you to use our forums but we're going to out your real

1643
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:58,940
name as a part of that. And not to get into the rant I got into several weeks ago on this

1644
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:03,980
show when that was the news but let's just put this quickly. If you think it's not a

1645
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:08,180
big deal to have your first and last name out there fine but keep in mind you know some

1646
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:12,060
of us have had stalkers in the past and other scary things that you know make us a little

1647
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:17,340
hesitant to do that. So you know even though I don't have delusions of grandeur I realize

1648
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:22,060
this podcast is just this you know little podcast with a loyal fan base. You have to

1649
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:26,740
remember I have been stalked before because of it and for that reason I choose not to

1650
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:30,480
tell people my last name unless like I know them in real life. If you know me in real

1651
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:34,500
life it's not a big deal but just because of what's happened in the past I don't like

1652
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:39,000
it being out there. So I was not a fan of this at Blizzard. The other thing I was not

1653
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:45,620
a fan of was the friend of friend thing because what would happen on Real ID and they took

1654
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:50,220
this out but it was in there originally is that you could go onto your friends list and

1655
02:11:50,220 --> 02:11:58,220
see all of your friends friends first and last name. Which I sort of think I know what

1656
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:03,220
they were trying to do with that but as somebody again who has stalked before because somebody

1657
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:09,740
used a friend of mine to get to me. I can see where this is a potential for problem

1658
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:14,040
and it made me very mad about Real ID. Now Blizzard got rid of it. They finally pulled

1659
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:17,660
their head out of their butt and they decided not to do this on the forum and they turned

1660
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:21,580
off the friend of friend. They still have the real names in the game and if you add

1661
02:12:21,580 --> 02:12:25,260
somebody to your friends list they see your real name and so forth but at this point I'm

1662
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:28,660
kinda like okay well I don't add people to my friends list I don't really know so it's

1663
02:12:28,660 --> 02:12:33,340
really not a big deal. And that's kind of where Game Center is at and so I don't think

1664
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:37,660
it's the same thing that Blizzard is doing because now Game Center is doing what Real

1665
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:43,460
ID is now and nothing more and I think a big part of the reason why they're doing it is

1666
02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:47,060
that there were the spammers out there. People were posting on their Twitter you know add

1667
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:50,380
me on Game Center friends and then they got all these spammers. I don't really know how

1668
02:12:50,380 --> 02:12:55,300
you spam people on Game Center but whatever it was out there it was a problem so I think

1669
02:12:55,300 --> 02:13:00,780
this is how Apple's trying to fix the problem. Something else to throw out there is that

1670
02:13:00,780 --> 02:13:07,180
when I used Ping, wow did that tank, but I was on Ping for like a day. When I signed

1671
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:12,260
up for Ping I was able to use an alias. If you search for Rob Roberts on Ping you'll

1672
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:18,380
find me, my radio name. So if that's the name that's being used on Game Center then I really

1673
02:13:18,380 --> 02:13:22,680
don't have a problem with it, that's fine. But I don't know like I'm too, I don't really

1674
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:27,620
know anybody else to send a friend request to because at the end of the day Game Center

1675
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:32,180
there is zero point to it. What does Game Center bring to the iPhone gaming experience?

1676
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:38,580
Not a damn thing. Achievements and scoreboards. Whoopty shit. Especially for a lot of games

1677
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:44,580
that you could write off very easily. These are not serious games. Whereas World of Warcraft,

1678
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:49,220
that's a huge time thing for a lot of people and a very passionate experience. Whereas

1679
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:54,460
I don't think people get that connected to their iPhone games. You know it's like lol,

1680
02:13:54,460 --> 02:13:59,420
pocket frogs. I love my pickle, you hush. Honestly I don't really play a lot of Game

1681
02:13:59,420 --> 02:14:03,780
Center games. Mainly it's just Open Faint stuff because there's a lot more games that

1682
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:08,380
I play that have Open Faint in them. More of them are getting Game Center but I don't

1683
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:16,100
really care. Yeah I have one game on Game Center and all the rest of mine are Open Faint.

1684
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:21,580
So yeah, Game Center is, I don't think it's the same thing as Real ID. I think what they're

1685
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:28,720
doing, I mean, because at the end of the day, WoW has a lot of passion behind it. Game Center

1686
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:35,720
has a lot of, I don't care. No one cur behind it, you know? If I had to delete Game Center

1687
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:40,180
at the end of the day, I wouldn't cry. But if I had to delete World of Warcraft, I'd

1688
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:45,180
be very upset that Blizzard made such a dumb decision because, you know, I am, you know,

1689
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:48,900
call me an addict or whatever you want, I am very invested in that game because it is

1690
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:54,860
a way for me to kind of play games all along with my friends. So, there you go. Let's go

1691
02:14:54,860 --> 02:15:01,100
to the mailbag. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Every week you guys send us emails and we

1692
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:05,940
read them. Now the mailbags have been kind of light for the last few weeks but as I understand,

1693
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:08,660
the listeners have really pulled through this week, haven't they? They did and I've actually

1694
02:15:08,660 --> 02:15:12,580
cut out the really long ones. Aww. Sorry. Are you going to post them online or anything?

1695
02:15:12,580 --> 02:15:17,340
I might post them on the forum. I said there's one I would post on the forum. Okay. Um, but

1696
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:22,860
I have to do that when I'm ready for two. Um, so, first email. Um, by the lady that

1697
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:27,340
sent us Boobs, gamer girl. Wait, what? What? Boobs? What? Boobs? She sent a picture of

1698
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:33,260
her chest and she's wearing an Eggo t-shirt and quite lovely. Lego my Eggo. Says, I just

1699
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:38,340
wanted to write the show and say you guys do an awesome job. If you keep me, no, you

1700
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:43,340
keep me laughing and I love it. I wanted to know if anyone is excited about the new Cataclysm

1701
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:51,340
expansion or do you think it's just hype? Hey, hey. I missed part of that. What was

1702
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:56,700
that? Don't get me wrong. I've been a fan of World of Warcraft as a whole for a good

1703
02:15:56,700 --> 02:16:03,940
while now. After all, it's my crack AKA way out of the real world for a while. Anyway,

1704
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:09,740
just wanted to say again, a good job with the show. Sincerely, gamer girl. Without getting

1705
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:13,100
too much into the Warcraft discussion because now I have a whole nother show for that. Let

1706
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:17,100
me try to quickly answer the question. I don't think it's all hype because let's face it,

1707
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:21,900
if you do something the same way for forever, especially in gaming, it starts to get really

1708
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:27,500
dull. And if you look at vanilla World of Warcraft, the leveling from zero to 60 experience,

1709
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:32,700
it was now five years, six years old. That's as long as a lot of game consoles last. I

1710
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:36,740
mean, I realize now in this generation we're in, it's a little bit different, but even

1711
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:41,680
now we're what, five years since the Xbox 360 launched? And what is...huh? Honestly,

1712
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:49,380
we could use a Cataclysm in Final Fantasy 11. Granted, they had Dynamis, the uber elite

1713
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:55,260
hard Cataclysm. But here's the point I'm really trying to make, is that the Xbox 360 has been

1714
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:58,540
out for what, five, six years now? And what are they doing now? They didn't release a

1715
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:02,180
new console because of economy and so forth. What are they doing? They're releasing Kinect.

1716
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:06,420
They're trying to reinvent the old experience. Are you suggesting that the Red Rings of Death

1717
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:12,700
were the Cataclysm of the Xbox? Sure. So, now you have the Cataclysm coming to World

1718
02:17:12,700 --> 02:17:18,060
of Warcraft as a way to kind of reinvent the game and make old stuff new again. And so

1719
02:17:18,060 --> 02:17:21,620
for that reason, yeah, I think it is kind of a big deal. And I think if you are passionate,

1720
02:17:21,620 --> 02:17:25,360
I mean, you already know right now if you're buying Cataclysm or not. And the Galen Rockets

1721
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:30,340
are pretty awesome. They are. But, let's see, I'm trying to make a long story short and

1722
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:35,860
it's not really working very well. But I will say this, Cataclysm World of Warcraft was

1723
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:41,940
a great way for them to get World of Warcraft 2 without making it a whole new game and splitting

1724
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:46,700
the player base like what happened with EverQuest and Final Fantasy in some regards. World of

1725
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:53,140
Warcraft Cataclysm is WoW 2. It might not be as jarring of a change, but they went back

1726
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:58,300
and redid a lot of old shit and made it prettier and just short of the character models, which

1727
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:03,220
I'm sure will be in the next expansion. It's neat that Blizzard does innovate a little

1728
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:08,020
bit with each expansion. It's pretty cool. So I think it's a big deal. Okay, I'm done.

1729
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:11,900
Did you hear? Now, this didn't make our show roll, but did you hear that EverQuest 2 may

1730
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:18,780
be doing the same thing? What do you mean same thing? Like a Cataclysm type thing? What's

1731
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:23,780
the point behind it? Just trying to... Get people to play. They need to figure out a

1732
02:18:23,780 --> 02:18:27,500
way to cross the two worlds over, which I know would really piss the players off in

1733
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:31,660
some regards, but I just feel like where they went wrong was they really split their player

1734
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:35,220
base from EverQuest to people who don't want to leave EverQuest. There's got to be a way

1735
02:18:35,220 --> 02:18:40,180
to copy your character into EverQuest 2. Granted, I'm talking out my butt because I've never

1736
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:49,020
played EverQuest or EverQuest 2. I've only watched a friend play the first one. Anyway,

1737
02:18:49,020 --> 02:18:53,340
my point is they made a mistake splitting the player base, but everybody got to learn

1738
02:18:53,340 --> 02:19:02,540
from that. Next email. Aww, this makes my heart feel warm. Rob, Jamie, and Loki. I just

1739
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:08,060
wanted to say thank you. Having a couple of back episodes to listen to at work helped

1740
02:19:08,060 --> 02:19:12,260
me get through what has been the worst week I've had. Listening to friends I've never

1741
02:19:12,260 --> 02:19:17,220
met talk about and have fun doing something that they and I enjoy was a much needed bright

1742
02:19:17,220 --> 02:19:21,740
spot and distraction from everything. Thank you for all that you guys do, Brad. That's

1743
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:25,860
our Brad from PodCulture. Well, thank you very much, Brad. I appreciate that. We had

1744
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:30,980
a really nice message on our Facebook this week too. It's been a week of warm fuzzies.

1745
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:37,300
Thank you so much. Must be the holidays. Next one. Hey guys, it's Molten Brown. I just wanted

1746
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:41,660
to ask you for advice. I already have a Nintendo DS and I've been debating whether or not to

1747
02:19:41,660 --> 02:19:46,920
get a PSP for a long time. Part of me wants it for the way the system looks as well as

1748
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:51,020
better graphics the system offers compared to the DS, but I don't know if it's worth

1749
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:55,700
the price to pay if there aren't that many games that I will like on it. I really like

1750
02:19:55,700 --> 02:19:59,060
RPGs, fighting games, and games that offer a different visual or playing style than the

1751
02:19:59,060 --> 02:20:04,860
norm like Hotel Dusk. Does the PSP offer any good games that fit what I like? Also, I was

1752
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:08,460
wondering if the PSP is more comfortable to hold than the DS. I find that my hands start

1753
02:20:08,460 --> 02:20:12,300
hurting after holding the DS for more than an hour. Thanks for the advice, Molten Brown.

1754
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:15,740
This email is brought to you by the Netherlands. Do you like the dreary weather and temperature

1755
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:23,580
akin to fall on the East Coast? Then the Netherlands is the place for you. Um, Patapon? Patapon's

1756
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:28,500
cute. Roko Roko? Yeah, those are all cute games. If you like RPGs and fighting games,

1757
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:34,180
you need that Square Enix game. The fighting one that's Final Fantasy. Dissidia. Yes, Dissidia.

1758
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:38,100
That should be like number one on your list. But if you like a standard fighting game,

1759
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:44,020
the Tekken games on PSP are pretty nice. There's a Soulcalibur game out there, I believe. Yeah.

1760
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:50,660
There's also, as far as RPGs, Puppet Lacrosse was cool. I loved it. I played through it.

1761
02:20:50,660 --> 02:20:54,860
And the Final Fantasy remakes are awesome, if you can find them. Yeah. But, but don't

1762
02:20:54,860 --> 02:21:03,940
get the go. Yeah, don't get the go. Honestly, the go, the go needs to go. The, the... It's

1763
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:10,300
not worth the money. But, um, as for hand comfort, given that I have hand problems after

1764
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:19,300
my surgery, uh, the PSP really is fairly comfortable, just because of the curved ends on it. But,

1765
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:25,180
it, it's still reaching around for those buttons, and I have these little short thumbs. It's

1766
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:29,820
really about the same, in my opinion. Don't you think, Rob? It's about the same feel?

1767
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:34,380
I'm sorry, I missed... Comfort of the con, of the console itself. Uh huh. Do you think

1768
02:21:34,380 --> 02:21:41,380
that the PSP or the DS is more comfortable? Or are they about the same? I, I like the

1769
02:21:41,380 --> 02:21:46,260
feel of the PSP, because it feels like I'm holding a controller that has a, a, a video

1770
02:21:46,260 --> 02:21:50,140
on it. And so, you know, I have kind of, you know, I'm, I'm six foot two, so I have kind

1771
02:21:50,140 --> 02:21:55,100
of big hands. So, I don't know, it's, the PSP's not really a problem for me. The DS,

1772
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:59,700
um, it doesn't feel the same to me, because you're using one hand to kind of write. I

1773
02:21:59,700 --> 02:22:04,140
think I actually, to be honest, I like the way the PSP feels a little better, I think.

1774
02:22:04,140 --> 02:22:08,180
I don't like, that's why I don't like DS games that overuse the stylus. Once in a while's

1775
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:14,220
okay. But if I'm playing a DS game that now is stylus-free and uses the controller, then

1776
02:22:14,220 --> 02:22:21,060
it's cool. I'm, I'm, I'm cool with it. But the square feeling is a little weird. So I,

1777
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:25,900
I think I actually like the PSP better overall, I gotta admit. Well, just a few more, because

1778
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:32,380
we really did get a lot of email. Hello, OLR. Another word from Belgium here. My girlfriend

1779
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:36,500
bought Kinect for my birthday last week. What an amazing piece of technology. For the first

1780
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:40,220
time ever in six years, my girlfriend enjoys gaming. Yeah, she played other games, but

1781
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:44,060
found them too complicated because of all the buttons you need to use. Now she even

1782
02:22:44,060 --> 02:22:48,500
asks to game. Truly, this must be heaven. She tested Wii and moved too, but was not

1783
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:53,500
very interested in it. She thinks both are too limited to control different genres of

1784
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:58,940
game. Hell, even my father played bowling and Kinect, and he didn't suck at it. Anyways,

1785
02:22:58,940 --> 02:23:03,620
as I stated, Kinect is amazing. Everything Microsoft promised works perfectly. The major

1786
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:07,980
drawback is the space it needs, though my room is too small to play, to decently play

1787
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:12,740
Kinect. So I have to move my 360 and Kinect to the living room. But that's not my biggest

1788
02:23:12,740 --> 02:23:18,140
problem. What I was thinking of is this. I fear Microsoft might reveal a Kinect 2 or

1789
02:23:18,140 --> 02:23:25,380
Kinect HD next to E3. It will not need as much space as Kinect needs. Do you think Microsoft

1790
02:23:25,380 --> 02:23:30,540
will announce this early? Do we need to shell out another 150 euros next Christmas? Or will

1791
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:35,500
they do no such thing and hold onto the spacious Kinect? I don't think the space needed can

1792
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:39,860
be fixed with a firmware update. I would like to thank you for OLR. You guys really make

1793
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:44,480
my day. Yours truly, Fabrice. Honestly, you know, I think the third party company is going

1794
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:50,240
to come out with a solution to this. I think it's actually a lot simpler than it sounds,

1795
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:56,260
but literally snapping on a lens to the front of that would probably fix that right there.

1796
02:23:56,260 --> 02:24:01,300
Yeah, and your other question about will they announce something new at E3? No. No way.

1797
02:24:01,300 --> 02:24:05,780
Not this soon. This E3 is going to be about now. What is the next wave of games for Kinect?

1798
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:10,340
I think what Microsoft really needs to do at this year's E3, and the publishers, is

1799
02:24:10,340 --> 02:24:16,680
show us, okay, now we've seen you taking the Wii games and taking them to the next step.

1800
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:19,340
What are the Kinect games really about now? What are you really going to do with this

1801
02:24:19,340 --> 02:24:24,540
thing? I think that's what this next E3 is about, and what Microsoft has to show. I don't

1802
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:33,820
see them at all doing a Kinect 2.0. No, not this quick. Maybe a smaller one, like a slim

1803
02:24:33,820 --> 02:24:38,660
remodel type of thing. The budget Kinect. Again, I think it's too soon. Now, maybe a

1804
02:24:38,660 --> 02:24:45,300
price cut for the existing Kinect, that could come out at E3, but I don't see, especially

1805
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:49,340
this quick. I mean, you're talking like a little over six months after the launch. Not

1806
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:56,100
going to happen that fast. Now, as far as the next console goes, if Kinect proves popular,

1807
02:24:56,100 --> 02:25:01,700
which so far it is, I would expect that when we get to the Xbox 720 or whatever we call

1808
02:25:01,700 --> 02:25:08,220
it, Kinect will be built in to whatever it is they have planned next. But that whole

1809
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:15,700
whatever's next is still a good two years out, at least. At least. It's going to come

1810
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:20,740
a lot sooner from Nintendo than it is the other two. You know, Sony has said time and

1811
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:24,580
time again, ten year cycle, ten year cycle, ten year cycle. The only one that needs to

1812
02:25:24,580 --> 02:25:29,980
catch up right now is Nintendo. And in some ways, they don't, because they're still selling

1813
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:33,780
like crazy, because they're kind of the budget system at this point. But I see them going

1814
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:38,300
more of the route like they do with the DS and the Game Boys and all that stuff, where

1815
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:43,220
it's something that, it's an upgrade, but it still plays all the old stuff. Yep. I absolutely

1816
02:25:43,220 --> 02:25:49,920
100% think whatever we see next from Nintendo is going to be Wii Evolved. Not throwing out

1817
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:53,420
the whole Wii concept altogether. The Wii's been a huge seller. It's going to be Wii HD.

1818
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:58,660
It'll be Wiivolved. Wiivolve. Actually, that'll be the name of the console right there. Trademark

1819
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:04,820
Dark Sakura. That's right. Trademark. Copyright. Patent pending. Blah, blah, blah. Restricted.com.

1820
02:26:04,820 --> 02:26:14,020
Boobs. Nice. So, uh, next, and I'm only going to do two more. We really did get a lot. Greetings

1821
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:18,640
Orange Orange Radio. The first thing, I believe you're all mega excited to see Tron Legacy

1822
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:23,560
in about two weeks. Well, I've been seeing this ad on Facebook, and well, let me pull

1823
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:33,860
up the ad. It's a big flashy Tron Legacy thing. Dude, that looks like it's going to load the

1824
02:26:33,860 --> 02:26:40,380
old arcade game or something. Flash. I'm trying to see. Light Cycles! I bet that's like a

1825
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:45,180
Light Cycle arcade game on Facebook or something, huh? Upload your face. Get on the grid. Oh,

1826
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:51,020
so you can take a picture of your face and put it in this trailer. Oh, that's cute. That's

1827
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:57,220
like those dancing elves that I see around work every year. I hate the freaking dancing

1828
02:26:57,220 --> 02:27:03,300
elves. The Jib Jab. That's what it's called. I'm going to post this in the chatroom. It's

1829
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:08,300
basically a face mapping app. If you click on it, you may have to take a picture of your

1830
02:27:08,300 --> 02:27:12,940
face. Note, I said face because it didn't recognize anything else. And know that didn't

1831
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:18,140
mean I took a picture of my balls. I used my- What if you draw a smiley face on your

1832
02:27:18,140 --> 02:27:25,140
penis? I used my Moby Noggy screenshot of my character. And you get to watch yourself

1833
02:27:25,140 --> 02:27:31,220
get killed by Jeff Bridges. Just thought you'd think it was cool. Second, if I were to start

1834
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:34,340
World of Warcraft on the original expansion, would I just be locked out of the places or

1835
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:39,500
should I get Cataclysm and start there? Here's the thing. Cataclysm won't work without the

1836
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:45,300
regular game. I'm getting a lot of wow questions. Hoardhousepodcast.gmail.com. Just saying. Don't

1837
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:48,180
you have to have all the other expansions? You do. You do. But here's the thing, and

1838
02:27:48,180 --> 02:27:51,700
a lot of people are missing this. When they released the Cataclysm, when they released

1839
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:57,940
the Kraken, or Deathwing in this case, they evolved Old World permanently. So if you have

1840
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:02,500
World of Warcraft and nothing but, if you have Vanilla WoW, you will still get the new

1841
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:09,900
WoW experience. The Old World is gone. So it makes it a really good experience. There

1842
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:14,540
are other enhancements that make the Cataclysm worth purchasing, such as- But is Mr. T still

1843
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:19,780
there? I believe he is. He's not outside the cities anymore, but he'll come back. Such

1844
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:24,460
as, and just a short list, the ability to level to 85. New dungeons and raids that come

1845
02:28:24,460 --> 02:28:29,620
with that. The fact that you can roll a Worgen or a Goblin, and Worgen is going to be a huge

1846
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:38,900
race. I mean there's tons of furries that want to play Worgen. I'm half tempted if somebody

1847
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:43,240
gets me the game to put Star Trek Online aside to give it a try. Well there's one other thing

1848
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:47,320
I want to throw out there, and that is, now is an excellent time to suck yourself back

1849
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:51,420
into the World of Warcraft, because Blizzard's been having this huge sale, and I don't know

1850
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:58,060
if it's over yet or not, but Vanilla WoW, five bucks. Burning Crusade, five bucks. Wrath,

1851
02:28:58,060 --> 02:29:02,860
ten bucks. Twenty bucks gets you caught up to- They even had one. I already had the other

1852
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:06,260
two, the first two. I'm not sure if it was going on during the sale though, or whatever.

1853
02:29:06,260 --> 02:29:10,420
It was, you buy it at GameStop for fifteen dollars, you get a fifteen dollar gift card.

1854
02:29:10,420 --> 02:29:15,420
You get it for free, basically. Nice. Let me see if that sale is still going on. Dark

1855
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:20,060
Saga, if that sale is still going on, I will buy you Wrath of the Lich King as a Hanukkah

1856
02:29:20,060 --> 02:29:28,860
present. Okay. I'll give it a try again, I mean, shit. As much as I love Star Trek Online,

1857
02:29:28,860 --> 02:29:36,180
I can alternate months. Excellent. Except I don't want to have to go out and buy Cataclysm.

1858
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:41,140
I on the other hand will not be joining the World of Warcraft. If you don't have an intro-

1859
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:46,860
I'm not even going to try with you, you have a baby anyway. I don't join even the actual

1860
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:51,300
world right now, so. I was just going to say, as long as you don't want to roll a Worgen

1861
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:55,860
or a Goblin, there's not a lot for you until you get up to level 80. I still have- I have

1862
02:29:55,860 --> 02:30:03,760
a level 20, um, what the fuck are the goat people, Rob? Draenei. Draenei. I have a Russian

1863
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:09,140
goat people. Not enough rage. Alright, anyhow, Jovidaya on our channel says, all I hear

1864
02:30:09,140 --> 02:30:15,260
is blah blah wow, blah blah vanilla, blah blah blah. Puppies, rainbows, kittens, unicorns.

1865
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:24,540
Do I have your attention now? Naked men. Choaniki. Choaniki. No, um, I'm going to go finish.

1866
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:30,640
Okay, third- Majinamicon and other big words I can think of. Alright, um, okay third, can

1867
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:35,740
you patch a UMD or download PSP import games to English? Because I know that you can do

1868
02:30:35,740 --> 02:30:40,660
that for the DS, so I was wondering. Um, I'm sure within emulator? I don't know if there's

1869
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:45,820
people that do that, but maybe. It wouldn't be on UMD anymore. You would have to have

1870
02:30:45,820 --> 02:30:50,980
this whole ROM thing and then you're getting into shady hacks. So I'm sure it's possible.

1871
02:30:50,980 --> 02:30:56,660
Don't ever doubt what the hacker community can do, but it just- you'd have to go to the

1872
02:30:56,660 --> 02:31:02,520
darker parts of the internet to find it. Okay, one last thing, DarkSakurai, in Comic

1873
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:06,860
Insanity do you guys talk about anime as well? Typically not unless they have a comic attached

1874
02:31:06,860 --> 02:31:14,860
to them and not necessarily manga. We really focus on Marvel, you know, DC, IDW, Udon,

1875
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:19,700
basically US-based companies, so. Although we've gone into a little bit of the manga

1876
02:31:19,700 --> 02:31:23,700
before. I think it's one of those, like, inevitables. Like, you know food is going to come up on

1877
02:31:23,700 --> 02:31:28,860
OLR and you know that manga's gotta come up on Comic Insanity once in a while. And, uh,

1878
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:33,020
He Who Shall Not Be Named on Comic Insanity. And just like, and X-to-Fur's Masturbation

1879
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:37,300
Habits will come up on Horde House. Just saying. Yes. It says, thank you, and DarkSakurai,

1880
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:40,140
your grammar coaching is appreciated. Well, if you really appreciated it, you would've

1881
02:31:40,140 --> 02:31:45,620
spelled grammar right. Nice. Let me get some comments from chat. Chat.orangessauceredo.com.

1882
02:31:45,620 --> 02:31:51,380
I love this comment. SSG100Matt says, so Jamie went from World of War crap to I might consider

1883
02:31:51,380 --> 02:31:55,380
playing it over the course of an episode. I might consider playing it if someone else

1884
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:59,340
buys it for me. This is the awesome thing about Orange Launch Radio. Hey look, last

1885
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:05,740
week we went from guy tweeting us saying isn't this game cool to having the creator on our

1886
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:11,340
show hours ago. Every gamer has a voice. I love this show. It's amazing. Uh, DDRDollarBill

1887
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:17,780
in the chat says, shit, I'm still jonesing for DC Universe to try it out. It's awesome.

1888
02:32:17,780 --> 02:32:23,420
It needs work, but it's awesome. Remember, this is, if someone buys it for me, I would

1889
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:29,780
play it. Fair enough. And that means I'd have to give up Star Trek Online for a month. And

1890
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:33,900
I don't want to be kicked out of my fleet. So I still have to think about it. SalaciousPop

1891
02:32:33,900 --> 02:32:38,900
in our chat room says, a UMD rip, which I've used, is like 500 to 900 megabytes. That's

1892
02:32:38,900 --> 02:32:45,380
an awful lot to patch. Also, most torrented PSP games are just disk images, hence UMD

1893
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:51,460
rip. Text patches actually modify game files. I would have thought, though, because you

1894
02:32:51,460 --> 02:32:56,420
can do it so easily with, you know, like Super Nintendo ROMs and stuff. But then again, what,

1895
02:32:56,420 --> 02:33:01,780
the largest Super Nintendo images are what, 1632 megs? So I can see where it's probably

1896
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:08,260
a much bigger pain in the ass. But again, don't doubt the hacker community. Where there's

1897
02:33:08,260 --> 02:33:14,740
a will, there's a way. Right? Indeed. Any more emails tonight? Oh, they're still reading

1898
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:20,540
this email. Oh, my bad. Um, thanks for reading my email. And if you didn't, what the fuck?

1899
02:33:20,540 --> 02:33:26,500
Also, Darsakha, fuck my life. And why would you let Rob lick Dan's balls just to mess

1900
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:32,660
with you? Remember, Dan made balls last week. We were eating. Did you forget about your

1901
02:33:32,660 --> 02:33:38,300
husband's balls? No, it's just now they're ground beef. Oh. Your loyal listener, Haseo

1902
02:33:38,300 --> 02:33:42,980
Sumiragawa. P.S. Can I get a woot from the Minnesota listeners? Because Garrett Hedlund,

1903
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:48,100
aka Sam Flynn, was born in Rosso, Minnesota, about 100 miles from where I live and pissing

1904
02:33:48,100 --> 02:33:53,500
distance from Canada. Canadian! Tron Legacy officially made of win. All right, let's get

1905
02:33:53,500 --> 02:34:00,000
a woot from the Minnesota listeners. Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. I'm sure they're out

1906
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:06,540
there somewhere. Well, we have one last email. All right. And this one, I, you know, it's,

1907
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:10,700
okay. I'm just trying to keep away from the political, in charge stuff, but this is a

1908
02:34:10,700 --> 02:34:15,900
good email. With all the homophobia, don't ask, don't tell, Prop 8, among others, why

1909
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:20,780
does it matter if anyone is gay or not? The way people worry about being gay or being

1910
02:34:20,780 --> 02:34:25,140
near someone gay, I can't help but make the comparison to the X-Men movie and fear people

1911
02:34:25,140 --> 02:34:31,100
had towards mutants. That's where mutants came from, kind of. All the arguments against

1912
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:35,340
gay marriage, gays in the military, gay teachers, to me, are unfounded and stupid, and the more

1913
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:39,820
they try to defend their position, by the way, they are spelled T-H-E-I-R, not T-H-E-R-E,

1914
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:45,260
but position, the more stupid and ignorant they get. Agreed. Except for your spelling.

1915
02:34:45,260 --> 02:34:49,820
I hope one day it just won't matter, there's an apostrophe and won't, and everyone is treated

1916
02:34:49,820 --> 02:34:56,420
the same. I wrote this email after talking this very subject with my wife several times.

1917
02:34:56,420 --> 02:35:01,260
I just can't figure out why it matters if everyday life, in everyday life, if one is

1918
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:07,260
gay or not. What people do in the privacy of their own homes is their own business,

1919
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:10,780
and why should it dictate if you can do a job to defend our country or get married?

1920
02:35:10,780 --> 02:35:15,420
Sorry for the email, I'm not gay-related, but I just wanted your opinion on this again.

1921
02:35:15,420 --> 02:35:20,340
And there's a gay-related part, so I'll read that next. I agree with everything. So, you

1922
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:29,020
missed it earlier, I had my FKHH shirt. Yeah, I mean, what you're saying, I think, is the,

1923
02:35:29,020 --> 02:35:33,900
I don't want to say the right viewpoint, but in a way it's kind of like, in a perfect world,

1924
02:35:33,900 --> 02:35:38,580
where hopefully in the world our children and our grandchildren live in, you're right,

1925
02:35:38,580 --> 02:35:46,180
it won't be a big deal. It's just whatever, no one curr. But I think right now, I think

1926
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:51,140
sometimes, you know, because there's two extremes to this. There isn't necessarily just the

1927
02:35:51,140 --> 02:35:56,180
homophobic side, but then there is the side that likes to drag people out of the closet,

1928
02:35:56,180 --> 02:36:01,540
so to speak, which I'm not necessarily sure I agree with either. Because there's people

1929
02:36:01,540 --> 02:36:06,660
that don't want it to be that big of a factor, that would prefer not to say that they're

1930
02:36:06,660 --> 02:36:11,380
quote in the closet, but that they just don't make it, they don't, for whatever reason,

1931
02:36:11,380 --> 02:36:14,920
want to make it a huge part of their life. I think that one's life shouldn't necessarily

1932
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:21,100
be dictated by their sexuality. Yeah, absolutely. It's an aspect of the life, but it's not your

1933
02:36:21,100 --> 02:36:30,220
entire life. I don't go around thinking about, oh, I'm going to fuck Dan every day. Sorry.

1934
02:36:30,220 --> 02:36:39,180
I just like that. Is that what your inner voice sounds like? I'm gonna fuck Dan. No.

1935
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:47,820
I've been using the redneck voice for Pinkberry too. I'm going Pinkberry. Nice. But no, I'm

1936
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:55,580
just saying, you know, it's like, I'm going to be, I'm going to, you know, oh, I eat only

1937
02:36:55,580 --> 02:37:01,820
tacos so I'm only going to do things associated with tacos. You know what I mean? Right. It's

1938
02:37:01,820 --> 02:37:09,060
like, okay, you know, if you prefer to sit on the toilet or pee, you know, if you prefer

1939
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:16,740
to pee standing up or sitting down, guys, is that determine your life? You know what

1940
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:22,740
I mean though? I'm picking something that, cause some guys prefer to pee sitting down,

1941
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:28,100
some guys prefer it standing up. When did you choose to pee sitting down? When did you

1942
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:33,500
choose to pee standing up? When did you choose to be gay? When did you choose to be straight?

1943
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:41,100
It doesn't matter. Hey, hey, hey, Matt, when did you choose to be straight? Boobies. I

1944
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:50,180
don't know. When did I choose? I don't think I did choose. Exactly. Point. But Matt's also

1945
02:37:50,180 --> 02:37:55,100
on the side of reasonableness. Matt is where the rest of America needs to be. You know

1946
02:37:55,100 --> 02:38:00,780
what I mean? And generally our listenership I think is on that same page. That is promising

1947
02:38:00,780 --> 02:38:05,420
more than anything. You know, obviously it's no secret on the show. I'm gay. Although,

1948
02:38:05,420 --> 02:38:10,240
Oh my God. But well for the longest time, you know, uh, especially when the show was

1949
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:15,940
first podcast, when it first came out on the show that I was gay, there was quite a few

1950
02:38:15,940 --> 02:38:20,380
emails about the whole like, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait. Rob's gay. Like, because

1951
02:38:20,380 --> 02:38:25,140
if you remember, well, hold on though. Remember for the longest time we were doing a live

1952
02:38:25,140 --> 02:38:29,140
show and then a separate podcast. So there were a lot of people that were listening to

1953
02:38:29,140 --> 02:38:33,900
the podcast that weren't listening to live show where like the, the other talk was happening.

1954
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:39,140
Whereas on the podcast until we combine the shows, then it finally came out probably,

1955
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:42,540
you know, like a year and a half after we've been podcasting. And you know, I'd mentioned

1956
02:38:42,540 --> 02:38:45,940
some guy had been dating or whatever and you know, there was, there was quite a few emails

1957
02:38:45,940 --> 02:38:53,220
that came in that next week. Okay. So I don't remember getting any thing bad. Uh, I got

1958
02:38:53,220 --> 02:38:57,820
one that was a little iffy, like I don't, it wasn't necessarily negative, but it was

1959
02:38:57,820 --> 02:39:02,820
more of like an I'll pray for you thing. And it was kind of one of those, you know, okay,

1960
02:39:02,820 --> 02:39:09,220
thanks but no need. You know, I know that if there's a higher power, I try to live my

1961
02:39:09,220 --> 02:39:15,680
life to the best of moral being that I can and what higher power that is nothing but

1962
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:20,020
love is going to send me straight to hell to burn for an eternity for trying to be the

1963
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:26,660
best person I can be. That's a ridiculous way of thinking. Exactly. It's, you know,

1964
02:39:26,660 --> 02:39:36,860
this is the whole way I look at it. It's like, you know, it's, I'm trying to think lifestyle

1965
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:42,380
is like going out to the clubs and dyeing your hair blue or you know, if you want to

1966
02:39:42,380 --> 02:39:49,660
be seen or, or you know, lifestyle is how you live your life, what you've chosen to

1967
02:39:49,660 --> 02:39:56,980
do with your life. But that's not lifestyle. That's just an aspect. It may contribute to

1968
02:39:56,980 --> 02:40:02,700
your lifestyle, but it's not something that you choose to do. You know what I mean? I'm

1969
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:05,460
trying to make sense with this. It's not something. I don't mean to laugh at you. I'm laughing

1970
02:40:05,460 --> 02:40:09,940
at chat because you know, Alan said something funny, so I'll read it in a minute. But it's,

1971
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:15,820
it's just like, it really shouldn't have to do with anything. It shouldn't be a big deal.

1972
02:40:15,820 --> 02:40:21,820
It shouldn't be anybody else's freaking business. Uh, let's see. Salacious Pop in our chat room

1973
02:40:21,820 --> 02:40:27,340
says, quote, I will inform Jesus ASAP of your wrongdoing so that he may send his Healy vagina

1974
02:40:27,340 --> 02:40:31,860
beams at you so that you can go to heaven because I'm concerned about you so much. Look,

1975
02:40:31,860 --> 02:40:35,500
and I don't mean to mock religion. I think there's a lot of good stuff that can come

1976
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:40,540
out of religion, but unfortunately there's also a lot of bad stuff that can come out.

1977
02:40:40,540 --> 02:40:43,580
You know what I mean though? You know what I mean? I never want to disrespect somebody's

1978
02:40:43,580 --> 02:40:49,980
religion until that religion disrespects me. Right? Well, and I'm going to plug this once

1979
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:53,300
on the show because I think that everyone who listens to it actually get a lot of good

1980
02:40:53,300 --> 02:40:57,460
out of this. There's um, and I follow him on Facebook and I've actually plugged the

1981
02:40:57,460 --> 02:41:04,060
podcast. The guy's name is John Shore. He's an evangelical Christian. He did a movie called

1982
02:41:04,060 --> 02:41:10,420
Lord save us from your followers. And the whole movie is basically him actually going

1983
02:41:10,420 --> 02:41:14,700
out and striking up conversations with people to find out why they don't like Christians,

1984
02:41:14,700 --> 02:41:19,060
why they have a problem with evangelicals, you know, actually just going in and asking

1985
02:41:19,060 --> 02:41:27,700
questions. And you know, meeting, he went to San Francisco to Castro to talk to people.

1986
02:41:27,700 --> 02:41:32,220
Quite a few fabulous drag queens on there too. But I mean the whole, the whole point

1987
02:41:32,220 --> 02:41:40,420
is that it's like you need to stop being right and start respecting other people. It's, you

1988
02:41:40,420 --> 02:41:45,820
know, that close minded, Oh, this is the only way it can be. Maybe it's because the Bible

1989
02:41:45,820 --> 02:41:49,660
said this or maybe my pastor said this. This is the only way it is and all the rest of

1990
02:41:49,660 --> 02:41:54,260
you are wrong. That is no way that's going to automatically close the door on anything

1991
02:41:54,260 --> 02:41:58,940
you have to say. Excellent point. One other thing I want to say on this and I swear we

1992
02:41:58,940 --> 02:42:03,620
can get back to games, but um, you know, whatever we're, we're allowed to get on off topic grants

1993
02:42:03,620 --> 02:42:08,460
once in a while because I clearly don't ask, don't tell on the whole hubba loo about that

1994
02:42:08,460 --> 02:42:11,800
right now in America motivated this email. Like, yeah, I think there was a party said

1995
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:16,180
talking about to the wife about serving and all that. So clearly there was some motivation

1996
02:42:16,180 --> 02:42:21,860
by that whole hot topic. And the thing that gets me and the just, just the idiot perspective

1997
02:42:21,860 --> 02:42:27,460
and the people that have the biggest problem, I think sometimes with homosexuality and even

1998
02:42:27,460 --> 02:42:31,660
so much what they're saying, the problem is with don't ask or, or the, or why they need

1999
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:38,340
don't ask, don't tell is that straight men or certain straight men are threatened because

2000
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:43,900
they don't want guys checking them out. They don't want other guys checking them out. And

2001
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:50,940
there's a part of me that goes, A, get over yourself. Do you know, uh, there's probably

2002
02:42:50,940 --> 02:42:56,460
a lot of people that don't care less just because someone's gay. I don't find every

2003
02:42:56,460 --> 02:43:01,300
guy in the world hot just because I happen to be gay. In fact, there's, there's quite

2004
02:43:01,300 --> 02:43:09,140
a few ugly ones out there. I hate to say it. Uh, but you just, when people kind of have

2005
02:43:09,140 --> 02:43:13,100
that perspective of like, well, I hope he's not gay cause I'm not, he's going to try to

2006
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:17,580
put in my butt. I'm just, I just think like you're the one with issues if that's your

2007
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:23,740
line of thinking, like why is that such a big deal to you? Why does that, I mean what

2008
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:27,960
ultimately boils down to a compliment, right? When somebody likes you, that's a compliment.

2009
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:35,300
Why does that make you so freaky? Are they so scared? What was the word? Are they so

2010
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:40,420
insecure? Yeah, insecure. That's the perfect word. Well, and you know, it's, it's actually

2011
02:43:40,420 --> 02:43:47,620
a proven psychological point that a lot of people, not everybody, do have some homosexual

2012
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:54,620
tendencies. There can be a level of attraction. You may not fully, I guess, swing that way

2013
02:43:54,620 --> 02:43:58,400
to use the quote, but it has been proven. There's studies out there that everyone carries

2014
02:43:58,400 --> 02:44:02,300
a little bit. I mean, if, if not for you, I mean, and I've said, I don't know that I've

2015
02:44:02,300 --> 02:44:06,380
made this completely, but I've talked to you about it before, but I mean, if not for Dan,

2016
02:44:06,380 --> 02:44:14,100
I could easily have had a girlfriend. I've had flings, you know, I, I have, I'm completely

2017
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:21,420
attracted to everybody I guess, you know. Um, but it's not like I'm going to go up to

2018
02:44:21,420 --> 02:44:28,420
someone and go boobies. Really? Cause I think you did that once and you were drunk. I did.

2019
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:33,020
Just kidding. I will say one and I've told you this off the air before, but it did kind

2020
02:44:33,020 --> 02:44:42,420
of gross me out when I saw you kiss a girl. That's so wrong. But I have, you were drunk.

2021
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:51,060
I have kissed women. Yeah. Big deal. But it was dumb fun. It was, I'm not saying it grossed

2022
02:44:51,060 --> 02:44:55,060
me out. I'm just like, that's so weird. I know. I know. It was funny. But yeah, back

2023
02:44:55,060 --> 02:45:00,020
to the point. Yeah, it's, it's, it's interesting. But what, there was one other thing I want

2024
02:45:00,020 --> 02:45:04,400
to say about this. Oh, oh, here's the thing. If you're that guy that's really afraid of

2025
02:45:04,400 --> 02:45:09,200
another guy hitting on you or whatever, let me, here's a simple line to use. If, if somebody

2026
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:13,700
ever reveals to you their secret man crush on you, brings you on the, on the local talk

2027
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:19,940
show to out their crush or whatever on you. Thanks, but no thanks. I'll tell you what,

2028
02:45:19,940 --> 02:45:23,180
straight people have been using that line for a long time. Gay people use that line

2029
02:45:23,180 --> 02:45:29,260
with each other too. Thanks, but no thanks. Right? Yeah. If somebody says they have a

2030
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:33,380
crush on you, but you know, you, you just don't feel that same way or, or you happen

2031
02:45:33,380 --> 02:45:36,940
to already be in a relationship or married or something, no matter what the two genders

2032
02:45:36,940 --> 02:45:41,780
are. Thanks, but no thanks. It was like, remember great America when I went to gay day at great

2033
02:45:41,780 --> 02:45:48,900
America and the girl was in the bathroom and said I was cute. I was like, Oh, thank you.

2034
02:45:48,900 --> 02:45:54,340
I'm taken. It was that easy. I mean, I wasn't expecting it. You came out of there and you

2035
02:45:54,340 --> 02:45:59,940
were like, Oh, Hey, I'm looking hot today. Well, you were there. You saw, I was tickled

2036
02:45:59,940 --> 02:46:05,900
all day. I was like, she thought I was nice to get a compliment. I know it's not, I mean,

2037
02:46:05,900 --> 02:46:10,140
I was like, that's so cool. I mean, there wouldn't be a single person in this universe

2038
02:46:10,140 --> 02:46:15,180
I would cheat on, you know, while I'm with Dan, I would never. What about Margaret Cho

2039
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:22,500
circa 10 years ago? Nah. All right. I, you know, I am completely and utterly dedicated

2040
02:46:22,500 --> 02:46:29,820
to my husband. You are completely and utterly dedicated to Alan and Matt here is completely

2041
02:46:29,820 --> 02:46:40,860
and utterly dedicated to his phone right now. That's correct. You clearly love your wife

2042
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:49,340
very much. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. But I'm saying, you know, all of us in this room,

2043
02:46:49,340 --> 02:46:56,740
we have found our person. We were very happy people. You know, it's we, we have that level

2044
02:46:56,740 --> 02:47:00,780
of security that even if we weren't with our significant others that we'd just say, you

2045
02:47:00,780 --> 02:47:07,460
know, thanks, but no. All right. I want to say this in the chat because this is so good.

2046
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:12,620
Brad says, if someone is checking you out, be flattered. Now, if they stalk you different

2047
02:47:12,620 --> 02:47:16,520
story. Absolutely right. And it doesn't matter what the genders are in that case too, because

2048
02:47:16,520 --> 02:47:21,380
that stalking is when it crosses the line when thanks, no thanks. Doesn't get the message

2049
02:47:21,380 --> 02:47:28,380
across like it should to most reasonable people. That's a whole nother problem. And that is

2050
02:47:28,380 --> 02:47:35,040
free of whatever sexuality happens to be the case. Yes. Stocking is never cool. So if someone

2051
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:43,020
tells you thanks, but no thanks, try, try for a friendship or go fishing again. I've

2052
02:47:43,020 --> 02:47:46,340
had times where the first time I've been like, no, I'm not really insured. They came back

2053
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:50,460
a week later and said, you know what? I'm, I'm, I still would really like try. Will you

2054
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:54,660
give me a chance? I'm going to be okay. You know? All right. I'll give you a chance. The

2055
02:47:54,660 --> 02:48:02,180
third time. No, that's creepy. I I'm, I'm kind of okay with the second try, but after

2056
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:09,380
that, no. Oh my God. There was this one time I'm getting texted. Oh, nevermind. We're going

2057
02:48:09,380 --> 02:48:14,340
to print tomorrow for the American overview. So what time the print is. So, but it's like

2058
02:48:14,340 --> 02:48:20,220
when I was working at Aladdin's castle in Mobile, Alabama, this guy comes in and he's

2059
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:29,700
like, Hey, you're cute. I'll go out with you. I'll be here to pick you up when you off work.

2060
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:36,540
And I was like, I am taking, this is right when Dan and I were first, you know, considering

2061
02:48:36,540 --> 02:48:40,940
each other, but I was like, dude, I'm not interested. I was like, thank you, but no,

2062
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:44,700
I'm not interested. I'm going to be here. Well, I'll have you know that our security

2063
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:53,100
guard is an ex army ranger and I'll be calling him to be here. So the guy didn't show up,

2064
02:48:53,100 --> 02:48:59,780
but I'm saying, but I'm saying, you know, you've got to be confident in yourself and

2065
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:05,420
take it as a compliment. If someone is checking you out, go, yeah, huh? In your head. And

2066
02:49:05,420 --> 02:49:09,620
you know, if you're not interested with them, go, no, thank you. If they're not loony and

2067
02:49:09,620 --> 02:49:15,640
crazy and you know, bizarre and shocking, then they'll go, well, okay. Make sad face

2068
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:20,300
puppy eyes at you and then go pout. But if again, just to try and bring closer to this,

2069
02:49:20,300 --> 02:49:23,900
if you're one of those guys or, or girls or whatever, that's I want someone of the same

2070
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:28,140
gender checking me out, then you know what? Your attitude is probably not attractive and

2071
02:49:28,140 --> 02:49:33,500
no one is probably checking you out. Just food for thought. Well, the game part of the

2072
02:49:33,500 --> 02:49:37,260
email. Okay. Game related stuff. Earth Defense Force is one of my favorite games and can't

2073
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:42,620
wait for Earth Defense Force to hope it is online co-op. Great ship. It is online co-op

2074
02:49:42,620 --> 02:49:48,660
three player ratio. Keep up the great work and honestly, and the honesty you have toward

2075
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:54,740
life and gaming. Oh, that's a compliment. The honesty we have towards life and gaming.

2076
02:49:54,740 --> 02:49:59,460
This has been a week of warm fuzzies for as far as like compliments go and so forth. And

2077
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:04,180
I realize it's not been a warm fuzzy week for everybody out there in the world. Uh,

2078
02:50:04,180 --> 02:50:07,760
what with just God, the economy in general. And it seems like we always have these stories

2079
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:12,340
about closures and you know, other things. It makes me feel tingly, but it's, it's, it

2080
02:50:12,340 --> 02:50:16,820
does feel nice to get paid a compliment. We've been paid several this week and totally unsolicited.

2081
02:50:16,820 --> 02:50:22,300
I would like my next compliment in the form of money. Stop. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

2082
02:50:22,300 --> 02:50:27,420
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Any other emails tonight? Too many. I I'm done. Well,

2083
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:30,540
sorry to those didn't get through. You just unfortunately just picked the wrong week.

2084
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:35,940
I guess male bag of orange on trader.com. Try again. We'll get to you at some point.

2085
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:39,100
All right. This is the part of the show where we do the FUs of the week. I know it sounds

2086
02:50:39,100 --> 02:50:41,980
weird. I just talked about like, Oh, what a warm fuzzy week. And I'm like, all right,

2087
02:50:41,980 --> 02:51:06,820
time to rant. But here we go. You all right over there? I'm fine. Um, F you to, uh, you

2088
02:51:06,820 --> 02:51:12,980
know, not that recording podcasts all day was that bad, but F you to how tired I feel

2089
02:51:12,980 --> 02:51:18,580
after all that and how my throat hurts. But it's big. Thank you to Tiara for editing the

2090
02:51:18,580 --> 02:51:26,060
first podcast for me. Thank you. So yeah, mine's kind of warm and fuzzy too. Not cold

2091
02:51:26,060 --> 02:51:36,900
and sandpapery. I'm done. Loki, uh, if he this stupid overclock program, cause he only

2092
02:51:36,900 --> 02:51:42,220
knows how to underclock and that's not what I want. Uh, my view of the week goes to traffic

2093
02:51:42,220 --> 02:51:46,420
and people that don't know how to drive in the rain. My God, some of you California people

2094
02:51:46,420 --> 02:51:50,260
are so spoiled. Like the rain here is nothing and just, it rains and people know what they're

2095
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:56,820
doing. So F you to that. And then F you to the fact that I just, I have a very, very

2096
02:51:56,820 --> 02:52:05,020
busy week and weeks ahead and not necessarily bad, but yeah, F you to the fact that I can't

2097
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:12,220
just sit on my ass and be lazy all day. Some days that's what I want to do. All right.

2098
02:52:12,220 --> 02:52:16,140
Anyhow, let's move on to a couple more stories and we're going to open up the Skyline one

2099
02:52:16,140 --> 02:52:22,780
eight seven seven game O L R but not just yet. Don't say that to the chatters. No, not

2100
02:52:22,780 --> 02:52:27,780
the chatters. No, it's having to be the print preview at eight 45 in the morning, which

2101
02:52:27,780 --> 02:52:32,820
I guess is better than six in the morning. Oh, you have to get up early tomorrow. Fucking

2102
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:40,220
a lame. All right. How about some more stories? I'm looking forward to going Loki. All right.

2103
02:52:40,220 --> 02:52:53,260
Um, so this is neat. Uh, actually the Michael Jackson game. Now I'm not necessarily one

2104
02:52:53,260 --> 02:52:57,540
going to get it on the DS, maybe the Wii, maybe the connect and stuff when that comes

2105
02:52:57,540 --> 02:53:02,540
out because it's supposed to be just like just dance. But uh, for the DS of course there's,

2106
02:53:02,540 --> 02:53:09,180
they've done some very specific things. If you try to say pirate the ROM, um, this is

2107
02:53:09,180 --> 02:53:12,580
kind of neat and I know Jamie will get kicked out of this. Uh, one of the things that they

2108
02:53:12,580 --> 02:53:19,140
do first off is they have a vuvuzela, uh, playing on top of all the songs during the

2109
02:53:19,140 --> 02:53:25,420
game. And then of course they render the games touch screen, um, nonfunctional. So you don't

2110
02:53:25,420 --> 02:53:30,940
get to play the game and you don't get to listen to the music untainted by the vuvuzela.

2111
02:53:30,940 --> 02:53:35,680
So that's good. I love it. I want to do that just for the vuvuzela. I have to admit as

2112
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:39,980
much as I hate it when she breaks it out on the show. I think that is a really funny anti-piracy

2113
02:53:39,980 --> 02:53:43,580
measure. And I think more companies, you know, if they want to fight, fight piracy, they

2114
02:53:43,580 --> 02:53:53,500
should be doing it this way. Actually, actually I will have, have you know this. Uh, I actually

2115
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:57,940
played a real vuvuzela this week. Uh, one of my friends was having a birthday party

2116
02:53:57,940 --> 02:54:02,380
and one of the other friends that came to the party brought a vuvuzela with her. And

2117
02:54:02,380 --> 02:54:06,660
so, uh, I played it and it took me a minute to figure out how to play it. Like the first

2118
02:54:06,660 --> 02:54:12,380
couple of times I was doing it, it just kind of sounded like a really loud, wet fart. But

2119
02:54:12,380 --> 02:54:17,180
once I was able to get it, it was kind of fun. So there you go. What are you taking

2120
02:54:17,180 --> 02:54:22,060
pictures of me for? What's this for? Are you gonna take my soul? All right. She's stealing

2121
02:54:22,060 --> 02:54:30,180
your soul. Your soul is hers. Dead air. I don't know what she's doing. I downloaded

2122
02:54:30,180 --> 02:54:35,500
an iPhone app that's like fat booth program. Cause I'm going to be, no, it isn't. It does

2123
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:45,820
gal style here. I'm going to put that on the website. Yes. I think, I think then I should

2124
02:54:45,820 --> 02:54:54,780
get to do the unicorn pick of you. All right. I'll do the unicorn picture here in a minute.

2125
02:54:54,780 --> 02:54:57,820
Tiger claw in our chat says, I'm Rob. That isn't one of them. Mozilla sounds like a wet

2126
02:54:57,820 --> 02:55:04,060
fart. I know I was playing it wrong. I told you. All right. A better hairstyle. One more

2127
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:07,500
story for you guys. And then I got to take the picture of the unicorn. So look, he's

2128
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:10,980
going to have to take the calls tonight. All right. Anyhow, this is a game. And I don't,

2129
02:55:10,980 --> 02:55:21,260
I don't even know what to think of this. Um, it's a game called cock out and it's a, you

2130
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:26,860
need a minute. All right. It's a German AIDS awareness organization who released this game.

2131
02:55:26,860 --> 02:55:31,780
It's called cock out, uh, and where players will actually slip on a motion sensing digital

2132
02:55:31,780 --> 02:55:39,080
condom and use their thrust to pummel a virtual HIV. Really? This is for real. This has gotta

2133
02:55:39,080 --> 02:55:42,820
be a joke, right? Commercial is hilarious. Well, there's an actual commercial out there

2134
02:55:42,820 --> 02:55:47,860
on the internet, uh, that has, um, booty in it. So dark soccer, did you see all this booty

2135
02:55:47,860 --> 02:55:53,860
in the commercial here? Yes, I did. I'm surprised you're not still giggling. And it's just basically

2136
02:55:53,860 --> 02:55:58,380
all these guys, uh, that look like they're whacking it. And, uh, I guess they're supposed

2137
02:55:58,380 --> 02:56:02,980
to be playing this game. Now, the part that gets me is that, okay, I just reported on

2138
02:56:02,980 --> 02:56:07,980
this and it's all over the game blogs and so forth. What's the actual game? Why are

2139
02:56:07,980 --> 02:56:13,240
all these guys looking like they're jerking it? Is that, that's it? Is there any type

2140
02:56:13,240 --> 02:56:20,700
of strategy or anything to it or any, why am I asking these questions? Of course not.

2141
02:56:20,700 --> 02:56:27,860
Why am I even bothering, right? Why are you taking another picture of me? All right, hurry,

2142
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:33,380
hurry up. Loki, can you give the phone information while she takes this damn picture? So, uh,

2143
02:56:33,380 --> 02:56:42,260
to Skype us, you need 1-877-GAME-OLR and, um, do that via Skype or via the 1-800 number.

2144
02:56:42,260 --> 02:56:45,500
You are so great. And then, uh, on Skype, what was it? Orange Lounge Radio? Orange Lounge

2145
02:56:45,500 --> 02:56:52,140
Radio. Oh, we're on Skype. Or 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our, uh, Skype line is now open. Give us a

2146
02:56:52,140 --> 02:57:00,860
call. There you go. Loki, do you have any, uh, maybe you need one of those pictures of

2147
02:57:00,860 --> 02:57:06,500
Loki. Do you have any last minute stories for us, Loki? No, I'm not next. I'm sorry,

2148
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:10,660
uh, you must have your mistake with somebody else. All right, I'm gonna get the Darkstalkers

2149
02:57:10,660 --> 02:57:14,620
unicorn picture real quick here. Uh, so, in the meantime, uh, do you have any last minute

2150
02:57:14,620 --> 02:57:18,660
stories while we wait for some calls? Well, I was just gonna mention how awesome, uh,

2151
02:57:18,660 --> 02:57:23,500
Swords in Poker 2 is on the iOS platform. Definitely need to check that out. If you

2152
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:28,660
haven't already, it's a pretty awesome role-playing game and, uh, I'm not getting paid by them,

2153
02:57:28,660 --> 02:57:33,080
which is disappointing because I could really use extra money. I mean, who can't use extra

2154
02:57:33,080 --> 02:57:37,740
money? And hopefully that's bought me enough time to get into the forum to where the extra

2155
02:57:37,740 --> 02:57:41,180
stories are. Because I have not been looking for extra stories, I have been playing with

2156
02:57:41,180 --> 02:57:51,860
my phone. And, uh, of course, um, awesome. What the hell is this? Apparently there is

2157
02:57:51,860 --> 02:57:58,500
a NASCAR Superstar driving game that will let you race dumpsters. That's pretty funny.

2158
02:57:58,500 --> 02:58:05,700
Um, yeah, uh, Jimmy Johnson's Anything with an Engine is a brand new game and apparently

2159
02:58:05,700 --> 02:58:10,540
lives up to its name and you can race a dumpster with a rocket apparently on it. That is pretty

2160
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:16,700
awesome. Um, also, I'm not sure if anyone saw this this week, uh, I'm sure a lot of

2161
02:58:16,700 --> 02:58:21,580
people have, the custom Tron bikes that they had out there, the light cycles, pretty awesome

2162
02:58:21,580 --> 02:58:26,620
except for the fact that they don't glow. They're completely unrideable. Uh, not unrideable.

2163
02:58:26,620 --> 02:58:31,460
They look way uncomfortable. Well. And then just like you have to push them to get them

2164
02:58:31,460 --> 02:58:34,700
going and you don't fall over. They should've made the new, how they have that four-wheel

2165
02:58:34,700 --> 02:58:39,820
vehicle that they have now. Yeah. They should've made that instead. Well, how, how the crap

2166
02:58:39,820 --> 02:58:49,540
do you, do you change the tire? You can't. It's a custom tire. See? Waste of money. Um,

2167
02:58:49,540 --> 02:58:53,900
I was gonna mention DJ Hero 2. They've got some, uh, new download content coming out

2168
02:58:53,900 --> 02:58:58,860
for that, which is pretty exciting. Uh, especially since it's got more Prodigy in it and one

2169
02:58:58,860 --> 02:59:03,900
of the songs I was hoping to make it into the game to begin with, uh, that didn't, but

2170
02:59:03,900 --> 02:59:10,020
now it has. Uh, Invaders Must Die mixed with, um, Debaser from the Pixies. That's kinda

2171
02:59:10,020 --> 02:59:15,060
cool. Uh, Beastie Boys Body Movin' mixed with, uh, Lenny Kravitz, Rock n' Roll is Dead. Of

2172
02:59:15,060 --> 02:59:19,380
course this stuff is already out. It came out this week. Uh, next week, actually two

2173
02:59:19,380 --> 02:59:23,860
weeks from now, the old school pack, they're gonna have Fat Boys with Human Beat Box mixed

2174
02:59:23,860 --> 02:59:30,860
with Mantronics. Um. Mantronics. King of Beats, dude. Kurt Mantronics is fuckin' awesome.

2175
02:59:30,860 --> 02:59:36,700
Uh, Tag Team, whoop, there it is. Once again in another game. Uh, mixed with, uh, 45King,

2176
02:59:36,700 --> 02:59:43,140
the 900 number. And then Beastie Boys, uh, Triple Trouble mixed with Tone Lock, uh, Funky

2177
02:59:43,140 --> 02:59:50,620
Cold Medina. And then, uh, December 21st, the Linkin Park mix pack with, uh, The Catalyst

2178
02:59:50,620 --> 02:59:57,620
Does It Offend You, Yeah, uh, Remix. And then, uh, When They Come For Me Remix and Points

2179
02:59:57,660 --> 03:00:00,220
of Authority Remix. The Points of Authority is gonna be awesome, so.

2180
03:00:00,220 --> 03:00:03,620
Okay, I have a call sitting on hold, sorry. Uh, caller, you're on the air. Hi, you're

2181
03:00:03,620 --> 03:00:07,660
on Orange House Radio. Who's this? It's Rama, and this time I wasn't even trying to get

2182
03:00:07,660 --> 03:00:10,580
on before everybody else. I knew, you know what, I was so distracted because I was taking

2183
03:00:10,580 --> 03:00:14,020
the picture of Jamie and making a unicorn out of her because I'm looking at these, what

2184
03:00:14,020 --> 03:00:18,980
the hell are these pictures on the website? You have problems. You know you love them.

2185
03:00:18,980 --> 03:00:22,540
I look like a Para Para girl in these versions. That's exactly it. I'm gonna make this my

2186
03:00:22,540 --> 03:00:29,540
Facebook picture. I love that. You should totally do it, Rama. I will. Uh, sorry, Rama.

2187
03:00:29,540 --> 03:00:33,380
So, so anyway, check OrangeHouseRadio.com in just a few seconds because I should have

2188
03:00:33,380 --> 03:00:37,460
Jamie's unicorn picture up there in a minute where it looks like the cat is jerking off

2189
03:00:37,460 --> 03:00:41,460
her horn. It's amazing. Alright. Hi, Rama, how are you?

2190
03:00:41,460 --> 03:00:48,460
Um, um, yeah. Damn it, Scott. You sure don't have a way of derailing, don't you?

2191
03:00:48,660 --> 03:00:52,260
Yeah, well, you know what, look, I just want to point out, I want to remind you, our guest

2192
03:00:52,260 --> 03:00:58,660
tonight made a game called Techno Kitten Adventure. Which I downloaded. What'd you think?

2193
03:00:58,660 --> 03:01:03,540
I haven't played it yet because I found a moe Japanese game on the live marketplace,

2194
03:01:03,540 --> 03:01:07,060
downloaded that, and had my roommate playing it for the last 20 minutes.

2195
03:01:07,060 --> 03:01:08,260
Nice. Yes.

2196
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:12,340
Sorry, I'm looking at Jamie's picture. Tonight's been a great night for pictures.

2197
03:01:12,340 --> 03:01:16,820
Anyway, excuse me. Uh, so what did you call in to talk about tonight?

2198
03:01:17,380 --> 03:01:20,740
I really want to talk about a couple of things, but it turns into a lot of things,

2199
03:01:20,740 --> 03:01:26,900
but I'll make it short and sweet as possible. Number one, this whole German age thing,

2200
03:01:26,900 --> 03:01:31,380
for obvious reasons, I'm kind of sort of offended by it, but I'll let that be.

2201
03:01:31,380 --> 03:01:34,660
Wait, why are you offended by this? It's just whackin'.

2202
03:01:34,660 --> 03:01:38,180
Um, let's just say I have people in my family who have died of said disease.

2203
03:01:39,300 --> 03:01:42,100
I see. So you find this to be disrespectful?

2204
03:01:42,100 --> 03:01:42,740
Yeah.

2205
03:01:42,740 --> 03:01:48,500
Hmm. Okay, interesting. This is interesting because, well,

2206
03:01:50,420 --> 03:01:56,100
is it just disrespectful because it seems to be so trashy and in your face type of thing, or what is it?

2207
03:01:56,100 --> 03:01:58,580
That pretty much is the case.

2208
03:02:00,100 --> 03:02:03,060
What do you think about this whole, I've got to pick your brain on this,

2209
03:02:03,060 --> 03:02:07,620
and I'm sorry because I know this is a sensitive issue to you, but I want to ask this question

2210
03:02:07,620 --> 03:02:10,820
because this is something that's been on my mind this week and it really has nothing to do with

2211
03:02:10,820 --> 03:02:15,860
gaming, but whatever. It's been an interesting part B tonight. Have you seen that whole campaign

2212
03:02:15,860 --> 03:02:22,500
of the celebrities who have quit Twitter to try and raise a million dollars for AIDS awareness

2213
03:02:22,500 --> 03:02:28,500
where they're all lying in the coffins dead and so forth? What do you think of that whole thing?

2214
03:02:29,700 --> 03:02:35,380
I think it was quite ridiculous and I don't know if you saw, but on my personal Facebook page,

2215
03:02:35,380 --> 03:02:39,460
I made a statement about that and a few people agreed with me about it.

2216
03:02:39,460 --> 03:02:40,340
No, I missed it.

2217
03:02:41,540 --> 03:02:45,860
I'll link it to you later. I have made a personal statement about how I truly felt.

2218
03:02:46,580 --> 03:02:50,020
And can you summarize it or am I getting a little too-

2219
03:02:50,020 --> 03:02:56,900
Long story short, I understand this epidemic, but instead of dealing with the whole world event,

2220
03:02:56,900 --> 03:03:02,900
let's take care of the America first. Let's take care of that AIDS issue and the US first before

2221
03:03:02,900 --> 03:03:07,540
we go running around taking care of everybody else. Why give all that money to those world

2222
03:03:07,540 --> 03:03:12,660
charities when you can send that same amount of money to American charities for the same cause?

2223
03:03:13,220 --> 03:03:18,820
Well, I would hope that we can find a cure and that'll be good for everybody. That's my hope.

2224
03:03:18,820 --> 03:03:22,260
All right. Well, I didn't mean to derail, but-

2225
03:03:22,260 --> 03:03:22,900
That's cool.

2226
03:03:22,900 --> 03:03:25,860
What else is on your mind tonight besides potentially offensive games?

2227
03:03:26,580 --> 03:03:30,500
The whole thing about people not being able to get over themselves because

2228
03:03:30,500 --> 03:03:35,460
guys make these compliments and so forth, if I had an issue with that,

2229
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:41,700
I wouldn't be able to go to conventions because half the people I roll with are gay,

2230
03:03:41,700 --> 03:03:45,860
lesbian, transgender. We have a good time. We go to the cause, we party,

2231
03:03:45,860 --> 03:03:51,380
we drink our asses off. It's all good. When I was working in Staples, I had a couple of

2232
03:03:51,380 --> 03:03:55,700
gay guys I used to hang with who always compliment me and like, you know,

2233
03:03:56,260 --> 03:04:01,140
mack on me, so on and so forth. I thought it was amusing and so did they. I had no problem with it.

2234
03:04:01,700 --> 03:04:07,060
Right. Like I'm sure, you know, a lot of straight people have that friend of the opposite gender,

2235
03:04:07,060 --> 03:04:13,140
like a guy, a straight guy has that girl that he flirts with, but it's nothing more than that,

2236
03:04:13,140 --> 03:04:19,300
you know? I'm sure there's, you probably have girls, not just gay guys, but girlfriends,

2237
03:04:19,300 --> 03:04:22,420
not, I don't know, friend girls that you do that with too, you know?

2238
03:04:23,300 --> 03:04:27,700
Yeah. Let's just say I did that one time and let's just say the two girls ended up having,

2239
03:04:27,700 --> 03:04:31,460
um, lap dance with each other. This was at a convention a couple of years ago. I was like,

2240
03:04:31,460 --> 03:04:32,340
holy shit, I'm good.

2241
03:04:32,340 --> 03:04:35,460
Well, now you're just talking about an anime convention and everybody,

2242
03:04:35,460 --> 03:04:44,820
everybody there is just horny. It's not really a gay or straight issue. It's just a horny issue.

2243
03:04:44,820 --> 03:04:47,140
Wow. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll give you that.

2244
03:04:47,140 --> 03:04:50,340
All right. Anything else on your mind before I let you go and get more calls?

2245
03:04:50,340 --> 03:04:54,180
I played that, that rom hack of Super Mario Brothers 3. That thing is

2246
03:04:54,180 --> 03:04:56,020
three levels below asshole Mario.

2247
03:04:59,300 --> 03:05:03,140
Three levels below, huh? That's a pretty precise rating. All right.

2248
03:05:03,140 --> 03:05:07,380
All right. I got to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for your insight tonight.

2249
03:05:07,380 --> 03:05:12,660
I appreciate it. Take care, buddy. You know, I was just telling the significant other,

2250
03:05:12,660 --> 03:05:15,700
we really need to go to New York city. And when we go, we're crashing with Rama

2251
03:05:16,580 --> 03:05:20,660
or as extra for would say, Randy. So you better be careful. Cause uh,

2252
03:05:20,660 --> 03:05:23,780
I really want to get back to New York city. It's been a very long time. And my one friend

2253
03:05:23,780 --> 03:05:28,660
that lived there moved to Texas. So I'm coming to, I'm coming to the couches of OLR listeners.

2254
03:05:28,660 --> 03:05:36,820
One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is orange lounge radio. All one word.

2255
03:05:36,820 --> 03:05:39,620
If you want to give us a call, we probably got time for about one more call. We are running a

2256
03:05:39,620 --> 03:05:44,740
little long tonight. So, uh, probably because the interview earlier, um, meanwhile, while we wait

2257
03:05:44,740 --> 03:05:48,420
for the phone to ring, Loki, do you have any other last minute stories? I don't know if you spent

2258
03:05:48,420 --> 03:05:53,860
them all or what? I've only done one of them. So no, I haven't spent them. All right. Then what

2259
03:05:53,860 --> 03:06:00,980
else? Uh, let's see. What else can we talk about here? How about, uh, let me just look up here.

2260
03:06:02,100 --> 03:06:11,700
Why is it open? It's odd. Um, hold on. Somehow it navigated while I wait for your riveting

2261
03:06:11,700 --> 03:06:17,620
last minute stories. Let me go to at least one more call here. Oh my God. Oh, hello. Hi.

2262
03:06:17,620 --> 03:06:23,860
Yes, it's Legend of Zaku here. Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, Legend of Zaku. Oh my God. What's

2263
03:06:23,860 --> 03:06:28,820
on your mind? Uh, nothing much. Just trying to kill a Sunday at night before heading to work

2264
03:06:28,820 --> 03:06:33,380
tomorrow. But yeah, you know, a lot of games came out in the past couple of weeks, you know,

2265
03:06:34,180 --> 03:06:38,900
that I've been trying, you know, dying to talk about. Like obviously Gran Turismo 5,

2266
03:06:38,900 --> 03:06:45,460
even though I don't have a PS3 yet, that's on my top list right now. And so we're basically just

2267
03:06:45,460 --> 03:06:51,140
trying to catch up on some other 360 games that I haven't been able to play. Let's just say I managed

2268
03:06:51,140 --> 03:06:56,340
to get a 360 again. Well, talk to us. What have you been playing? Playing catch up again. What

2269
03:06:56,340 --> 03:07:02,740
have you been playing? Um, when I didn't have my 360, it was nothing but like Left 4 Dead and

2270
03:07:02,740 --> 03:07:08,020
battlefields on my computer. But now I'm just playing, you know, small stuff like Sonic 4,

2271
03:07:08,020 --> 03:07:15,940
Ace Combat 6, Resident Evil 5. Although hopefully my girlfriend will hook me up with more recent

2272
03:07:15,940 --> 03:07:20,340
games for Christmas. I've already gave her a wishlist of what to get me. Is that what you

2273
03:07:20,340 --> 03:07:25,140
asked Santa for? Well, yes, Santa the four of my girlfriends is willing to spend money on me,

2274
03:07:25,140 --> 03:07:29,540
just as I'm willing to spend money on her. Okay, very cool. Well, tell us about like,

2275
03:07:29,540 --> 03:07:32,740
what's your favorite game been that you've discovered in the past couple of weeks since

2276
03:07:32,740 --> 03:07:37,860
you got your 360 back? I don't know. I mean, Sonic 4 has been really challenging so far.

2277
03:07:37,860 --> 03:07:42,420
Really? There's been a lot of hate on Sonic 4. There's been a lot a lot of hate on Sonic 4.

2278
03:07:42,420 --> 03:07:46,660
Do you disagree? You think the game's awesome? No, it kind of feels like a classic Sonic game.

2279
03:07:46,660 --> 03:07:53,060
I know it still has elements from the recent ones, like the whole homing attack thing. I mean,

2280
03:07:53,060 --> 03:07:57,700
I could do without it, but it's just, you're right. Some may say it's not fluid enough,

2281
03:07:57,700 --> 03:08:01,700
because it doesn't, it's not, it's not like the old fashioned Sonic where the screen would just

2282
03:08:01,700 --> 03:08:07,380
like literally breeze by every time he just like, every time he literally moves. So yeah,

2283
03:08:07,380 --> 03:08:12,420
he's gonna have some sense, he's gonna have some hate from those classic fans, and I'm one of them

2284
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:18,740
because I grew up on that. But on the other hand, it's just, it's much spiffier now. I mean,

2285
03:08:18,740 --> 03:08:22,500
the important thing is that Sega managed to maintain the mechanics more or less,

2286
03:08:22,500 --> 03:08:26,260
so you gotta give them credit for not, you know, screwing their pooch yet again.

2287
03:08:28,020 --> 03:08:32,500
Okay, all right. What do you think of the new one, and I apologize, you might have mentioned

2288
03:08:32,500 --> 03:08:37,780
it a little bit. What about Sonic Colors? I haven't played that game yet since I don't own

2289
03:08:37,780 --> 03:08:44,980
a Wii or DS, but I, from what I've seen, it's probably the same gameplay. It's mostly platform

2290
03:08:44,980 --> 03:08:49,540
now, from what I hear. I mean, 2D platform. There's been a lot of people saying Sonic

2291
03:08:49,540 --> 03:08:56,020
Colors is where it's at right now in the Sonic universe, so. Right, I mean, I guess because it's

2292
03:08:56,020 --> 03:09:02,420
like, you know, I don't know, I guess it maintains the same type of gameplay. As I said, I've never

2293
03:09:02,420 --> 03:09:07,460
played Sonic Colors yet, and that's one thing I need, a Wii. I should have bought one when it was

2294
03:09:07,460 --> 03:09:11,300
a hundred bucks at GameStop over Black Friday. You never know when they might do the next price

2295
03:09:11,300 --> 03:09:14,580
cut. I don't know if they'll get that low, but then again, the PS2 can take that low. No, but

2296
03:09:14,580 --> 03:09:18,900
I mean, that was for used systems. I could have, just like I picked up a used 360 for a hundred

2297
03:09:18,900 --> 03:09:27,060
bucks. Alright. Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Legend of Zaku? DDRX2 is going to,

2298
03:09:27,060 --> 03:09:34,340
well, they're taking orders for it. It's supposed to ship out in two weeks. So, every, it's just,

2299
03:09:35,060 --> 03:09:41,220
so far, it's shaping up to be pretty solid at this point. You know, fears about, like,

2300
03:09:41,220 --> 03:09:45,300
drifting arrows and what the, you know, the community was saying about, like,

2301
03:09:45,300 --> 03:09:50,340
being off sync. They're starting to get quelled every, you know, as we speak right now. They've

2302
03:09:50,340 --> 03:09:55,060
already, let's just say the Konami's already taken folks from Bomani Style and already proven to

2303
03:09:55,060 --> 03:10:00,900
them that the final build of the game will be rock solid and something that the hardcores will

2304
03:10:00,900 --> 03:10:06,980
definitely start playing. Assuming the arcades shell out 10 grand for a new machine, which is

2305
03:10:06,980 --> 03:10:10,740
the only way you're going to get the new game. Or, unless you already have X, then you get the

2306
03:10:10,740 --> 03:10:16,820
upgrade. Alright. Well, by the way, you need to check out Home, because they have DDR machines

2307
03:10:16,820 --> 03:10:20,820
in Home, but you don't really get to play DDR on them. But I giggled when I saw the X2 machines

2308
03:10:20,820 --> 03:10:27,940
in the Konami home space. Yeah, and hopefully, you know, assuming I get my Christmas bonus this

2309
03:10:27,940 --> 03:10:32,660
year, I will definitely shell out money on a PS3. Alright. Alright, buddy, we're going to let you

2310
03:10:32,660 --> 03:10:37,540
go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call. Alright, take care. Bye! Alright,

2311
03:10:37,540 --> 03:10:40,100
that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. I'm sorry to those that didn't get through,

2312
03:10:40,100 --> 03:10:43,620
but we kind of are running along a little bit tonight, and we still want to get to the

2313
03:10:43,620 --> 03:10:48,260
afterbirth and all that good stuff. So, email us your thoughts. Mailbag at orangeontrader.com,

2314
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:53,620
or send us tweets. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Meanwhile, we got to wrap it up, put the nail

2315
03:10:53,620 --> 03:10:57,540
in the coffin of the show. Do we have any last minute stories, Loki? Yeah, real quick. This is

2316
03:10:57,540 --> 03:11:02,900
kind of cool. From the same guy that did the Left 4 Dead demake, you know, kind of making the

2317
03:11:02,900 --> 03:11:12,260
pseudo NES version of Left 4 Dead, but, you know, it's a PC game. Pixel Force also did that too.

2318
03:11:12,260 --> 03:11:19,060
DJ Hero. Now they have an 8-bit DJ Hero game you can check out. It's got a bunch of cool chiptune

2319
03:11:19,060 --> 03:11:26,660
mashups, including the, this is kind of cool, the Ghostbusters theme and Huey Lewis and the

2320
03:11:26,660 --> 03:11:34,580
newest I Want a New Drug mix together. I can hear that. Apparently they said that one, it got some

2321
03:11:34,580 --> 03:11:40,100
of the background or whatever was sampled from the same song or something, but lots of cool stuff,

2322
03:11:40,100 --> 03:11:47,540
and you can check it out for free, and let's see where you can download that. Oh, ericruthgames.com.

2323
03:11:47,540 --> 03:11:58,900
So that's pretty cool. And then, what else here? The Xbox Live Rewards program, something that just

2324
03:11:58,900 --> 03:12:04,020
launched, so if you're a gold member or whatever, I don't even think you need to be a gold member,

2325
03:12:04,580 --> 03:12:12,020
but you get some kickback Microsoft points for different things that you do. For example,

2326
03:12:12,020 --> 03:12:19,860
renewing a one month gold membership will give you 10 Microsoft points back. Three months, 30,

2327
03:12:19,860 --> 03:12:26,420
and 12 months, 200. Purchase or renew an Xbox Live Gold Family Pack, that gives you 400.

2328
03:12:28,100 --> 03:12:34,580
Purchase or renew the first Xbox Live online gold membership, 100. Make your first purchase

2329
03:12:34,580 --> 03:12:42,340
on Xbox Live, another 100. Select content's gonna vary. If you activate and use Netflix on Xbox Live,

2330
03:12:42,340 --> 03:12:49,620
you get 100, and they have surveys for 20 Microsoft points. So, neat. You can do surveys

2331
03:12:49,620 --> 03:12:54,660
and get 20 Microsoft points? Yes. Interesting. It'd take a lot of surveys before you can actually

2332
03:12:54,660 --> 03:12:58,740
buy something. That's true. Well, you could get Technokit and Adventure for four surveys.

2333
03:12:58,740 --> 03:13:05,620
That is true. Alright. That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We're

2334
03:13:05,620 --> 03:13:09,540
about on out of here. Hey, if you liked what you heard tonight, or even if you didn't, you really

2335
03:13:09,540 --> 03:13:17,380
should still help us spread the word. Tell a couple of friends about our show. Go to our iTunes

2336
03:13:17,380 --> 03:13:22,660
and leave a nice five star review, or just spread the word. Tell a friend or two about our program,

2337
03:13:22,660 --> 03:13:28,820
because we don't have, you know, all the advertising dollars and so forth behind our show.

2338
03:13:28,820 --> 03:13:34,820
So just tell a friend or two. That's all we ask. Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for

2339
03:13:34,820 --> 03:13:41,620
our listeners tonight? You look lovely. Oh my, thank you. Rather so lovely. My final thought is,

2340
03:13:41,620 --> 03:13:52,180
thanks, but no thanks. Loki, your final thought? My final thought is, I'm tired. Alright. That's

2341
03:13:52,180 --> 03:13:56,900
gonna do it. Have a great week everybody. We really appreciate you, especially those folks

2342
03:13:56,900 --> 03:14:00,580
that tuned in live and stayed up through the whole thing. But even you podcasties,

2343
03:14:00,580 --> 03:14:03,700
thanks for staying with us through the whole thing. We really appreciate it. Have a wonderful

2344
03:14:03,700 --> 03:14:08,340
