[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little dreidel.

9
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:00,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it made out of clay?

10
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:00,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

11
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:01,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

12
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:03,897

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,081
[SPEAKER_09]: How have you been celebrating Hanukkah?

17
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you do anything besides light some fire?

18
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:11,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to temple.

19
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:12,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan went with me.

20
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,745

[SPEAKER_09]: and they were loving some Rock Band and I was like, okay.

23
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really play much Rock Band.

24
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:11,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually, I'm not going to be doing a lot of gaming for the next week and a half because number one, Dan has Gran Turismo 5 and number two, finals.

25
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:12,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Bummer.

26
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, busy week.

27
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:14,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Bummer on both counts.

28
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:27,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding, I'm not hating on Gran Turismo 5 I am I'm not very good at the Uber driving games I'm angry I'm great at arcade racers How can the Veyron not be a premium car?

29
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:35,053
[SPEAKER_09]: IDK Bastards Also say hello to, we gotta introduce, Tech Master Loki Hello How are you, Loki?

00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:41,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing fine Alrighty, good to hear it I know your wife celebrates Hanukkah, so have you been doing anything for that?

31
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:42,157
[SPEAKER_09]: No No?

32
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:42,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright

33
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:45,982
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, there you go.

35
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this is something I could do while I'm not working.

36
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:18,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I also do want to take a moment to poll our listeners and send us an email.

37
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:18,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

38
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:21,105
[SPEAKER_02]: At mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com so Rob can read it.

39
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:21,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

40
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:22,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

41
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:27,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, who would be interested in an Orange Lounge book?

42
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:30,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a text message about this.

43
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:32,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know more about your thoughts on this.

44
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Why you suddenly want to do a book.

45
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm sure the not having a job right now has a lot to do with that.

46
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:42,328
[SPEAKER_02]: To commemorate our fans and talk how awesome we are.

47
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:43,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be a pop-up book?

48
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm not good with writing.

49
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:48,215
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a physical book to be ordered or...

50
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:49,596
[SPEAKER_02]: An e-book.

51
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,457
[SPEAKER_09]: An e-book.

52
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Can it be something I listen to on my iPod?

53
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:53,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that makes sense.

54
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:03,247
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a physical book with pictures and links to goodies.

55
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:04,348
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the OLR yearbook.

56
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,009
[SPEAKER_02]: and Easter Eggs.

57
00:04:25,276 --> 00:04:29,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Michelle on the Outsiders shows has a book deal, but I don't think it has anything to do with her shows.

58
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:32,598
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the, what is that site?

59
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:36,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh God, it's been everywhere, and it's her and her sister's site.

60
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn you, autocorrect.

61
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,279
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

62
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen that site?

63
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:40,279
[SPEAKER_09]: That's her site.

64
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:40,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

65
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,160
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think she's got a book now going on about it, so you know.

66
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,021
[SPEAKER_09]: If all these other all games people can do a book, so can we.

67
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:48,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it.

68
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

69
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:50,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyway.

70
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:52,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Ours just won't be as good.

71
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:53,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, anyway.

72
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm designing it.

73
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be amazing.

74
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:57,643
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you see?

75
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I just got kicked in the face.

76
00:04:59,426 --> 00:04:59,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyway.

77
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,672
[SPEAKER_09]: All books aside, let's talk about video games and the games we've been playing this week.

78
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:05,554
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what types of games have you been playing this week?

79
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:06,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

80
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:07,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing?

81
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:12,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, Star Trek Online, because I'm updating the Tribble server right now.

82
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:15,678
[SPEAKER_02]: At, like, 1K.

83
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,981
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I played some Solitaire.

84
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:29,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been very busy because the American River Review, which is the magazine that I've done some design for, goes to print on Monday.

85
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:31,304
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where the book idea is coming from.

86
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:31,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

87
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:36,309
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, I got the idea from the book I did for my client because we just published it.

88
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really easy.

89
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be very easy for us to do a book.

90
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:45,272
[SPEAKER_02]: But back to this, the American River Review.

91
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:51,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as we have the order information up, I'll be linking it to everybody because you have to buy a copy.

92
00:05:53,434 --> 00:06:16,307
[SPEAKER_02]: um but the American River Review is uh all of the uh literature the art digital physical media fashion and culinary for um American River College for 2011 we win tons of awards we beat out big schools we are amazing I did the culinary section I designed it anyway and um

93
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:23,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's definitely, you know, something that anybody should have a copy of because it really is an impressive product.

94
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:24,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had our proofs.

95
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:25,936
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our proofs last week.

96
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:28,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what's been taking up my time instead of games.

97
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,098
[SPEAKER_09]: But you said the hubby's been playing Gran Turismo 5, right?

98
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:32,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, we did have some Scott Pilgrim.

99
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:34,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, fun.

100
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

101
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Gran Turismo 5 pretty?

102
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:39,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, except for the shadows are retarded.

103
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,863
[SPEAKER_09]: A little early for that music.

104
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty as in that music.

105
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:44,123
[SPEAKER_09]: As in that music?

106
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Is as pretty as that music?

107
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the music in the game is very elevator-y.

108
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,893
[SPEAKER_02]: There's new My Chemical Romance in there that makes me happy.

109
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:56,416
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura gave me a beer before tonight's show, so if things are a little bit off tonight like what just happened, you know what?

110
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:58,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Just roll with it.

111
00:06:58,778 --> 00:06:59,178
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it off?

112
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,059
[SPEAKER_07]: This always happens.

113
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:07,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at any rate, at any rate, it's got some stuff that needs to be fixed.

114
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:13,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I still hate that all the people around the track are like, we're just standing here, we are stiff, we don't do anything but wave.

115
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:19,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to see more stuff going around, because the game can handle it, it's just not...

116
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:22,863
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to see some women flashing their titties as you drive by.

117
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:24,184
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the game needs.

118
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:30,827
[SPEAKER_02]: The cool thing in this game is that it has the Top Gear test track and the Stig.

119
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:34,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And your driver looks kind of like the Stig from Top Gear.

120
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,809
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't have Rainbow Road, which is really disappointing.

121
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,510
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have go-karts.

122
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,611
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be awesome if they just, you know, because, come on, it's Gran Turismo.

123
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,912
[SPEAKER_07]: They take themselves way too damn seriously.

124
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:49,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Just throw in some wacky shit in there.

125
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,034
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, we're driving in space now.

126
00:07:52,694 --> 00:08:00,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because it's a realistic sim racing game, but just put it in some very unrealistic situations and have fun.

127
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:04,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Gran Turismo 6, In Space

128
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:39,376
[SPEAKER_02]: You're supposed to be doing a patch that's supposed to fix a lot of the problems, so we'll see.

129
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:43,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sit in there sometimes and listen to the elevator music and usually I fall asleep while Dan's playing.

130
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:45,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.

131
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

132
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:24,317
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's it's really like it's like a chibi role-playing game but the whole battle system not so much I mean kind of like puzzle quests I guess they you have a grid of um you start off with a grid of a five by five and then um in the middle there's a grid of uh three three by three uh poker cards and

133
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:48,482
[SPEAKER_07]: and the whole goal is to make up different poker hands and by doing that you do specific amounts of damage to the monster that you're attacking and then the monster does the same thing as well and you can charge up a wild card and stuff and then they have different magic that you can cast that rearranges some of the cards or does different things or shields that block certain damage and stuff like that.

134
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:48,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

135
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:50,102
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually really fun.

136
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a free game or when you had to pay?

137
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:54,984
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it does cost money.

138
00:09:56,445 --> 00:10:00,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how much money, but it costs money.

139
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:01,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Very awesome game.

140
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:03,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing that most of the week.

141
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:07,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, just probably Grand Theft Auto.

142
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,129
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it.

143
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:16,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com There's a little bit of chatter going on with our ever-present fourth guest on the show, you guys.

144
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of talk on Gran Turismo 5.

145
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,681
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw in our chat room says, Gran Turismo 5 looks so amazing.

146
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:26,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't help but be mesmerized by the graphics as I watch people play the game on Justin.TV.

147
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:34,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And Justin.TV, from what I remember when we were doing our video feed on there in the old studio, it's not like it has the best quality.

148
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:38,087
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that still comes across really well, that's pretty amazing.

149
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:44,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even remember that.

150
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:46,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, Loki just kind of did this.

151
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:48,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it'll never happen.

152
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

153
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:50,143
[SPEAKER_07]: It stinks.

154
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:51,305
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be coming out soon.

155
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,667
[SPEAKER_07]: By soon we mean six years.

156
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:53,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

157
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:53,948
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

158
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:55,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

159
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:00,710
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the folks in chat are talking a little bit about Gran Turismo songs.

160
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,751
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Dark Knight says, Need to kickstart my heart to the best Gran Turismo song ever.

161
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:10,752
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dark Tetsuya says, Actually, that's the first song on my Gran Turismo 3 playlist.

162
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:15,573
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of talk about the soundtrack of Gran Turismo.

163
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:16,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you noticed the soundtrack?

164
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I said earlier it has New My Chemical Romance in there.

165
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:20,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right.

166
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:20,494
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

167
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,035
[SPEAKER_09]: You were talking about all that.

168
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:23,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, once...

169
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:31,042
[SPEAKER_09]: One song that I do not believe is on the Gran Turismo 5 soundtrack, but is in a game we're going to be talking about a little later tonight is...

170
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:38,648
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, that happy hardcore song from Techno Kitten Adventure.

171
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,310
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Sea of Love by Frisco, if you wanted to know who it is.

172
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:47,777
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember last week on the show, we got a tweet saying that we needed to check out this game called Techno Kitten Adventure.

173
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:52,322
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were laughing our ass off because it's just awesome.

174
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, laughing with them, not at them.

175
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:57,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

176
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,351
[SPEAKER_09]: to on-air interview in one week.

177
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:24,192
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing what can happen here at OLR.

178
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:26,714
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have Nick from Techno Kitten Adventure at 7 o'clock.

179
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,155
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just over 30 minutes away.

180
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:29,236
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exciting.

181
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you checked out Techno Kitten Adventure, huh?

182
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,060
[SPEAKER_09]: You thought it was a little basic.

183
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I played it a little bit.

184
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:38,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

185
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:48,532
[SPEAKER_07]: It's similar to, I guess, like the Robot Unicorn Attack games where the concept's very simple, but what draws you into the game is just the fact that

186
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:51,600
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so unusual, I guess.

187
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,844
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, the gameplay itself, it's all one button.

188
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You just, you know, a button to control the thrust on a jetpack.

189
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:02,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I don't know.

190
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:07,997
[SPEAKER_07]: If I were to improve something upon the game, I would maybe tighten up the controls a little bit at level three.

191
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:12,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also maybe, you know, make it a little harder.

192
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:15,205
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to ask them if there's any plans for a sequel.

193
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:20,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the game has shown up in the top games on Xbox Live Indie Games, right?

194
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:20,887
[SPEAKER_09]: It's there.

195
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,588
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like the number one game, but it's not number 500.

196
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:25,009
[SPEAKER_09]: It's there.

197
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,030
[SPEAKER_09]: So we definitely want to ask them about that.

198
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And I played the game as well.

199
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,852
[SPEAKER_09]: And even though it is as basic, let's say, as an Atari 2600 game...

200
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:36,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I think... In fact, I'm pretty sure I played a game like this on Atari 2600.

201
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:51,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the environment that he created and just the, you know, absurdity, outside-the-box type of thinking he constructed the game around is clearly this... Wouldn't this be funny if I combined X with Y and made Z?

202
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,362
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it really works, especially for a dollar.

203
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:55,262
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a dollar.

204
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:56,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

205
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:56,863
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

206
00:13:56,943 --> 00:14:00,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear, please don't say combine X, Y, make Z. Y. Algebra hell.

207
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:00,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

208
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:06,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you having flashbacks to school?

209
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:07,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my final is in.

210
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:11,669
[SPEAKER_09]: If 2X plus Y equals Z, solve for kitten.

211
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:14,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Meow.

212
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:15,914
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

213
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:17,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to talk a little bit about that.

214
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to know if he has any other games in the marketplace as well.

215
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,382
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to ask him all those questions.

216
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:24,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's worth it for one whole dollar.

217
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:26,549
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the type of game you're going to whip out a party.

218
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby's giving Loki a hard time.

219
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:29,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that?

220
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:31,776
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get more tight than one flipping button.

221
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:44,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, we were talking to Bobby, and of course Bobby Blackwolf is the gentleman that does the show before us at All Games Radio, the Bobby Blackwolf show every Sunday night at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern.

222
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And he always has us on at the very end of the show, which is very nice.

223
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:48,181
[SPEAKER_09]: He doesn't have to do that.

224
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:53,103
[SPEAKER_09]: But we were talking about this game a little bit, and we were kind of talking about how

225
00:14:54,318 --> 00:15:05,621
[SPEAKER_09]: We like that somebody went there and did this and didn't just try to make a clone of some other game because we're all about the whole kind of like absurd, outside-the-box sorts of ideas.

226
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:07,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember President Cat a year and a half ago?

227
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:10,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Why were we all excited about President Cat?

228
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,663
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't really the game itself, per se.

229
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the game itself was really just an average game.

230
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:21,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think a lot of the blogs who ultimately reported on, wow, there's this podcast trying to get this game called President Cat localized.

231
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:22,866
[SPEAKER_09]: What a bunch of weirdos!

232
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:24,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't forget playing the piano.

233
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and absolutely playing the piano.

234
00:15:53,357 --> 00:15:55,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't we get original shit like that?

235
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,581
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, why do we have to get these games we know are subpar and below?

236
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:01,381
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, I don't know.

237
00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:03,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're America!

238
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:03,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

239
00:16:03,803 --> 00:16:04,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you.

240
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:05,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is mediocre.

241
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:06,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so anyway.

242
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:10,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, Majin Makon in our chatroom says, Muscle March.

243
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:14,128
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a pretty unique Wii game, I will say that.

244
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:17,550
[SPEAKER_09]: There was at least that, so it's working.

245
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, so we'll get to more talk on TechnoKitten Adventure in about 30 minutes.

246
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,972
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the meantime, My Gaming Week.

247
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:25,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't talk about My Gaming Week.

248
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:28,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I mentioned TechnoKitten Adventure and I didn't play a whole lot else.

249
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:32,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I played quite a bit of World of Warcraft because there's big changes going on this week.

250
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:33,895
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have the other show for that now.

251
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:49,485
[SPEAKER_09]: so not a whole lot I want to say here otherwise other games I played some more Super Meat Boy which I think is a great Xbox Live Arcade game and that was really about it I had a work trip this week so I didn't really get to play a whole lot of games at home so sorry guys I'll try to play more next week

252
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:52,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, housekeeping tonight.

262
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:09,674
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura's going to read those in Part B a little later in the show.

263
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:12,175
[SPEAKER_09]: For now though, we're going to get into the news.

264
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:14,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's going to start us off tonight with some gaming news.

265
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:31,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, um, so, you know, it was funny because they were actually, um, quoting, uh, one of the quotes made about this device, allegedly, was that where there's smoke there's fire, well...

266
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:35,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you can get much more fire than this.

267
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:44,657
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation phone, of course, remember a while back they had some not so clear video of the device.

268
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:49,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And people were like, well, it's probably changed quite a bit since then and whatnot.

269
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:51,740
[SPEAKER_07]: But now they have really clear video.

270
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,582
[SPEAKER_07]: showing this brand new device called the Sony Ericsson Zeus Z1 PlayStation phone.

271
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:14,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And it kind of shows some of the features that it has, the slide-out controls, the dual kind of touchpad thing on the front that simulates the analog sticks.

272
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:16,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, the shoulder buttons as well.

273
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:18,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that looks like...

274
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:23,529
[SPEAKER_07]: They made possibly a front and back mounted camera.

275
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:30,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of neat stuff though that you would expect in like a PlayStation phone.

276
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:38,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And they even had some video of course showing them going to like the actual PlayStation mode where you could play different games and stuff.

277
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:41,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course there's no games loaded on there so couldn't really do anything with that.

278
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:51,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but it's very interesting to see all this stuff considering that they've kind of been denying, you know, oh yeah, we're not working on a PlayStation phone.

279
00:18:52,728 --> 00:19:00,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously something I would be willing to bet you'll see at CES because they've shown off this new hardware stuff and it seems right up their alley.

280
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the question I've got to ask about this.

281
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this the same thing as the PSP2?

282
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we've heard rumors about a PSP phone and we've heard rumors about a PSP2.

283
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:12,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And my question is, is it actually the same thing?

284
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:20,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I thought the rumors about there being sliders on the back and all this other weird stuff that we're seeing in this video was for the PSP2.

285
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that you mention it, that does make sense.

286
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:28,378
[SPEAKER_07]: The not-so-clear video or pictures that we saw before were of the PlayStation Portable 2.

287
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:34,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, we've seen some pictures before of the PlayStation phone, but they're different.

288
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:39,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in the design of how they are and stuff, they look different.

289
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:42,806
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a little bit similar to the PSP Go, almost.

290
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,146
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does look like a phone.

291
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:50,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the slide-out keyboard, you know, you could almost replace that with a keyboard and be it, you know, just a normal Sony Ericsson phone.

292
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:59,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it... Again, I hate to harp on this, but do you think that maybe the PSP2 is just this without the phone, like an iPod Touch is to an iPhone?

293
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:01,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly, and that would make sense.

294
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:05,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that would be... It would make sense, I would think.

295
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:12,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's going to be... I don't know if I really care for the idea that it has, like, a touchpad on the back of the device.

296
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think nowadays you kind of almost have to have everything as like a touch screen.

297
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:18,858
[SPEAKER_09]: You can pet it and caress it from the back.

298
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,879
[SPEAKER_09]: You can literally reach around your PSP and rub it a little.

299
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't understand.

300
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would be very awkward to have a touch pad on the back.

301
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:39,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because I don't think that would lend itself well to the games unless it's just some sort of, you know, context sensitive touch pad or something like that in addition to other things.

302
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:40,165
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

303
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the guy that's Bit.Trip Adventure.

304
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:09,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

305
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:10,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Or whoever he is.

306
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:10,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I have him.

307
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:11,588
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in one of the Warp Zones.

308
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,469
[SPEAKER_07]: I just saw some videos.

309
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:15,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's PC only, though, of the Minecraft guy.

310
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:16,534
[SPEAKER_09]: It is PC only.

311
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:17,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd heard about that.

312
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:17,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

313
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:19,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about cheap.

314
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:20,839
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah.

315
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,203
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, definitely...

316
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:27,410
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

317
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:53,869
[SPEAKER_09]: The Go kind of stopped, pun intended, the PSP chat for a little while.

318
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:58,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Because The Go, no matter how Sony or the fans try to spin it, was a miserable failure.

319
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:04,995
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a lot of stuff coming out from Sony for the PSP anytime soon.

320
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:09,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than, the only thing I've seen was Podapon 3.

321
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, so what?

322
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,102
[SPEAKER_07]: The second one that you were selling as a download title.

323
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:18,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know if that's...

324
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:20,685
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot to talk about.

325
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:24,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And that could be the very last game they have in development for the original PSP.

326
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:26,249
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be just all now PSP2 stuff.

327
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:28,891
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if this would actually be marketed as a PSP phone.

328
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,414
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, it happens to be... I mean, it's not branded as a Sony PlayStation Portable.

329
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,475
[SPEAKER_09]: It's branded as an Ericsson.

330
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:35,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, it's a prototype.

331
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:42,645
[SPEAKER_09]: But it still strikes me as, oh, it's this phone that happens to have PSP playing capabilities.

332
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:51,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like there was that GameCube that was marketed as a DVD player that happened to play GameCube games, but they didn't call it a GameCube.

333
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:51,978
[SPEAKER_09]: The Panasonic Q?

334
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:52,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right.

335
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,781
[SPEAKER_09]: The Panasonic Q. Thank you.

336
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:54,661
[SPEAKER_09]: PSP-2

337
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:24,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And also possibly, you know, something that's also that little touch panel thing that's on the front of the PSP phone.

338
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:27,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps this is where this patent comes from.

339
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:32,895
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that it uses a two-fingered touch gestures for data manipulation.

340
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:36,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And they specify that the touch interface may be separate from the main display.

341
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Very similar to what we saw with the PSP2.

342
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:41,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also said that...

343
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:43,585
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

344
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:02,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

345
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:14,442
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting, though, that they're putting out the... I mean, just based off what we've seen, I guess it's not make... I would be willing to bet that this thing's going to have a touchpad on the back for the PSP 2.

346
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:18,823
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have a touchpad on the front for, you know, the PSP phone or whatever.

347
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:25,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the stuff that we've heard over and over again and seen pictures of, I don't think this is going to change all of a sudden, so...

348
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:27,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's probably what we're going to expect.

349
00:24:27,824 --> 00:24:32,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're going to announce this at CES, you only have a few more weeks to wait anyways.

350
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:35,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's mid-January, so... I don't know.

351
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:37,147
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably coming.

352
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,607
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta know they're pissed about this, though.

353
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:40,648
[SPEAKER_07]: They are pissed about this video.

354
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:45,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single secret that they've had just leaks out.

355
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:46,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony, man, I...

356
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:49,924
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to do something about that.

357
00:24:50,384 --> 00:24:52,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangehauntradio.com.

358
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:58,786
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt, responding to a comment I made a minute ago, says, Why would I give my PSP a reach around?

359
00:24:58,826 --> 00:24:59,927
[SPEAKER_09]: It never did anything for me.

360
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:01,307
[SPEAKER_09]: It never made me a sandwich.

361
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:02,607
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good question.

362
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:09,469
[SPEAKER_09]: AlphaKananagram says, I don't think this phone is the graphical powerhouse the developers are saying the PSP 2 will be.

363
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:10,309
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

364
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:17,771
[SPEAKER_09]: There was that chatter, I think, that we covered on the show a few weeks ago from a developer saying, We've seen it, and it's a huge graphical powerhouse.

365
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:26,635
[SPEAKER_09]: So, which might explain how they plan to compete with the 3DS by presenting better quality graphics, perhaps, than what you're going to see in 3D.

366
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:29,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Because maybe the 3D thing will get old real quick.

367
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:29,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

368
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:34,999
[SPEAKER_09]: BlackWolf seems to think that the PSP 2 will be at Game Developers Conference.

369
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:37,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Might be the better place to debut it.

370
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,261
[SPEAKER_09]: GameDeveloperConference.com

371
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, totally left that out of my gaming week.

372
00:25:56,787 --> 00:26:02,093
[SPEAKER_09]: But on a listener's tip, I did try going into home this week and doing the whole DDR room or whatever.

373
00:26:02,113 --> 00:26:03,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't even get it to work.

374
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:05,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I gave up.

375
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:07,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I threw my controller into fitterage.

376
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:16,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, and then some folks are saying that it was the Panasonic Q, or as Frisbee says, the Panasonic QQQ.

377
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:26,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, Tigerclaw says, the PSP phone is just Sony trying to get into the iPhone and Android market for an app gaming perspective.

378
00:26:27,818 --> 00:26:30,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe trying to expand the Sony App Store or whatever.

379
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:37,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to get more PS1 game sales and the cross-platform PSN games you can buy and movies.

380
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:41,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know this thing will do everything the PlayStation Portable already does.

381
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:45,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to expand the marketplace potential, perhaps.

382
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:46,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Good thoughts.

383
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:48,553
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, moving on to another story.

384
00:26:49,093 --> 00:26:52,575
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a little bit of a follow-up to something that had come up last week.

385
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when I mentioned that Harmonix is for sale?

386
00:26:56,237 --> 00:27:02,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sadly, I'm not reporting about a buyer tonight, but I am saying somebody has said they are out of the picture, and you might be surprised.

387
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:06,283
[SPEAKER_09]: It came from an interview with Bloomberg at Bloomberg.com.

388
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:15,548
[SPEAKER_09]: The CEO of Electronic Arts, John Riccatello, actually has said that the company has no interest in pursuing more multi-million dollar acquisitions for now.

389
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:22,973
[SPEAKER_09]: The company is going to focus on better integrating some of the casual game developers, such as Playfish and some of the other casual gaming things.

390
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:24,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine Pogo is a part of that too.

391
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:29,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the people asked, are you interested in harmonics?

392
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:35,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And Riccatello said, if we did that, it would, quote, look like I'm doubling down on yesterday.

393
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:45,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure some smart investor will buy the business feeling they can catch a falling knife, but more people have been cut trying to catch falling knives that have benefited from getting the timing exactly right.

394
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:46,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.

395
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:46,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.

396
00:28:08,743 --> 00:28:10,545
[SPEAKER_09]: This whole rock band phenomenon.

397
00:28:10,985 --> 00:28:13,027
[SPEAKER_09]: They made the original Guitar Hero game.

398
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:13,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember?

399
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:16,270
[SPEAKER_09]: They were working with Activision back then and Red Octane and all that.

400
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,691
[SPEAKER_09]: They made the original Guitar Hero.

401
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:21,295
[SPEAKER_09]: They split off to do rock band ABC and so on.

402
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:25,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's to say Harmonix is not going to make the next big thing?

403
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:41,041
[SPEAKER_09]: That just seems, I mean, I realize you're taking a little bit of a gamble there, but if there's one thing, there's one thing I could say in the nine, ten years practically we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio, the developers that take risks are the ones that get the big payoffs.

404
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:50,489
[SPEAKER_09]: The ones that just sit there with their thumbs up their rear, making the same old crap year after year, Konami, don't usually get to have the big payoffs.

405
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:53,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami doesn't really do that anymore.

406
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:54,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, with their dancing games.

407
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:59,189
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as the music games go and the stuff this show started about, yes, they did for a very long time.

408
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:04,251
[SPEAKER_09]: And granted, they've got some other neat stuff coming out now and they still have Metal Gear, whatever.

409
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:07,392
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as the music game goes, that's how I feel.

410
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:15,356
[SPEAKER_02]: To quote the 62nd Ferengi Rule of Acquisition, the riskier the road, the greater the profit.

411
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:17,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

412
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:28,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So, maybe they should be putting the masters of business forward.

413
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:38,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, BlackWolf in our chatroom is saying that the falling knife thing is actually a misquote and the whole thing is not quite... I'm trying to look at what part of the story this is in here.

414
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,794
[SPEAKER_09]: He just linked us to something here.

415
00:29:40,694 --> 00:29:44,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess he actually came out and said, I think the music genre is going to recover.

416
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know exactly how.

417
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,659
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be based on some new innovation.

418
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it all becomes dance-based.

419
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:51,335
[SPEAKER_09]: He likes Harmonix, and he said,

420
00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:31,400
[SPEAKER_09]: the nervous investor would be worried about the decline of the music sector feeling like a falling knife the only part of that conversation that got reported was the falling knife part so he's saying I was misquoted although I guess they did use a part that he gave him but whatever he didn't mean to come off as harsh as he did so

421
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:38,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, at least I like the fact that he acknowledges that, you know, harmonics could be also sitting on this big thing here with Dance Central.

422
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:39,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's true.

423
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:42,090
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't frown as much as I did.

424
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:47,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't change the fact that they aren't interested in acquiring harmonics at this time.

425
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:52,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And even though maybe Falling Knife might have been harsh, it seems to be that the motivation behind that is...

426
00:30:53,742 --> 00:30:57,245
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have that next big thing just right yet, I guess.

427
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:02,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it is a little weird because he says Dance Central seems to be a big deal, but I don't want it.

428
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

429
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:04,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

430
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:05,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair loss.

431
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:07,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

432
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:07,695
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

433
00:31:08,974 --> 00:31:31,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for the Doctor Who fans like myself, there will be the last episode for the Doctor Who The Adventure Games called Shadows of the Vashta Narada, which for anyone who doesn't remember that one, this was the episode where they were stuck in the library and these things were eating the people, and it was the first episode that River Song showed up in.

434
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:34,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can you buy it here in the US?

435
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:56,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume the BBC website.

436
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:19,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

437
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:20,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

438
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:24,994
[SPEAKER_09]: The Underwater Christmas Adventure for Doctor Who.

439
00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:31,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think these... What I think is interesting about this, because the BBC is kind of paying for these games, right?

440
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,057
[SPEAKER_09]: They're paying for the development, right?

441
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:34,037
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like...

442
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:40,261
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very different... And you have to pardon my ignorance here a little bit, but I've never lived in another country.

443
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:53,871
[SPEAKER_09]: All I know is it's a very different setup here in America than it is in Britain, where it's a lot more... I guess you could say, to me, it seems like the BBC is sort of like their PBS.

444
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:58,914
[SPEAKER_09]: But over here in America, we think of PBS as the network that plays...

445
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:03,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Classic, Opera, Shows, Sesame Street, and occasionally Video Games Live.

446
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:11,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think the BBC is... But what I'm saying over there, they're actually making this more cutting-edge programming.

447
00:33:11,463 --> 00:33:14,625
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, imagine if PBS was making the shows Fox was making.

448
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:15,846
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of what it is.

449
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:16,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

450
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:17,267
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how it strikes me.

451
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:27,474
[SPEAKER_09]: But my point is, it's interesting that now we have this whole gaming thing coming out of that that is part of the public broadcasting industry.

452
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet here, we don't have anything like that.

453
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:31,803
[SPEAKER_09]: PBS doesn't really make games.

454
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:35,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think there's been stories on the show before about how there's kind of been a call for that.

455
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:48,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Like why do we have the public broadcasting system, but yet we don't have anything for making games outside of, I don't know, maybe like America's Army, although that's still the government contracting with somebody else to make that for recruitment purposes.

456
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:50,258
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the closest thing I can think of.

457
00:33:50,768 --> 00:34:00,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just to let you know, the Doctor Who games are actually up on direct2drive.com.

458
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:04,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just search for them there, but I'm going to put a link to the downloads in the chat room.

459
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:09,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the point that Tigerclaw is making in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

460
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:12,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's not forget PBS also plays British shows.

461
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,385
[SPEAKER_09]: The first time I heard Doctor Who was PBS.

462
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:18,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was my introduction to Doctor Who, and when I was little...

463
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:23,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Star Trek now, don't get me wrong, but when I was little, I didn't like Star Trek at all.

464
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:32,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching Doctor Who, which I thought was a lot cooler and a lot neater because the concept was neat and it was this crazy old man and all these people running around with him.

465
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:35,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And my first Doctor was the fourth Doctor with Sarah Jane.

466
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:38,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's to this day my favorite companion.

467
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:39,776
[SPEAKER_02]: She's back in the series.

468
00:34:39,796 --> 00:34:41,597
[SPEAKER_02]: She has her own series and that makes me happy.

469
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:44,718
[SPEAKER_02]: But Doctor Who is just awesome.

470
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Majinami... Majinamicon.

471
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:49,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Say Maji.

472
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:50,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Maji.

473
00:34:50,762 --> 00:34:51,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Namicon.

474
00:34:51,343 --> 00:34:51,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Namicon.

475
00:34:52,944 --> 00:34:53,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

476
00:34:53,564 --> 00:34:55,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Majinamicon in our chat.

477
00:34:55,246 --> 00:34:57,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that's what I said before and I got yelled at for mispronouncing it.

478
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:58,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

479
00:34:58,488 --> 00:34:59,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Says... Namicron.

480
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:06,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And yet some political extremists want to shut down all public broadcasts, radio, TV, etc.

481
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,255
[SPEAKER_09]: If I recall correctly.

482
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:08,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've heard that too.

483
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:11,158
[SPEAKER_09]: And... I don't know.

484
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:11,398
[SPEAKER_09]: That...

485
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,563
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because of NPR.

486
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:24,232
[SPEAKER_09]: The thought makes me sad because when I think of PBS, I think of Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and Bob Ross and shows like that that wouldn't exist without PBS.

487
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:26,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just makes me very sad.

488
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:33,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, granted, maybe I haven't yet developed an appreciation for some of the other stuff they show, like not in the morning or not for children, but...

489
00:35:34,142 --> 00:35:36,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it just would be very sad if that were to go away.

490
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:38,284
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what else PBS gave us?

491
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:41,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Fawlty Towers for our British television.

492
00:35:42,247 --> 00:35:42,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Dwarf.

493
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:45,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Red Dwarf.

494
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:51,772
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I watched Keeping Up Appearances and Are You Being Served and Monty Python's Flying Circus.

495
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:57,175
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more of this on the PBS, but now we have BBC America, I guess.

496
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Gamer Girl in our chatroom says, Wait, I'm lost.

497
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:02,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do they want to shut down PBS?

498
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:15,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Without getting too political on the show, I think it just boils down to that whole, you're poisoning the public minds with these crazy liberal ideas that PBS gives or whatever, which is a little bit ludicrous to me.

499
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:20,318
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think as DarkSakura referenced, a lot of it comes back to NPR.

500
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:28,104
[SPEAKER_09]: And when some people don't like what a public organization is saying, they want to shut it down, I guess is...

501
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:31,087
[SPEAKER_09]: The best way I can cut it.

502
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:35,453
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a lot of reading between the lines that goes with that type of stuff too.

503
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:39,197
[SPEAKER_02]: NPR gets a lot of its funding too from the Democratic Party.

504
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:44,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And PBS gets funding from political sources.

505
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:45,925
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

506
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:50,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that if people want to pay for it, let them pay for it.

507
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:51,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your problem.

508
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't listen to it.

509
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,673
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's people too busy being right and wanting others to think just like they do.

510
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:00,495
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bottom line.

511
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:02,276
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

512
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:04,017
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not going to go any further than that.

513
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:09,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying people being too busy being right and wanting other people to think the way they do.

514
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:10,665
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

515
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:14,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's talk about something we can all appreciate, and that is sales.

516
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:15,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, Loki?

517
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:16,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

518
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Black Friday always means lots of big sales.

519
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:27,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that, you know the game companies have to come out and start waving their cock around, I guess.

520
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Kinect, of course, sold very well.

521
00:37:31,212 --> 00:37:35,813
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've reached 2.5 million units with the help of Black Friday.

522
00:37:36,273 --> 00:37:37,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's worldwide, of course.

523
00:37:38,394 --> 00:37:42,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, they break it down, that's 100,000 units a day.

524
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:50,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And that they're on track to meet their original goal of 5 million units sold this holiday.

525
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:54,224
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome, I guess.

526
00:37:54,564 --> 00:38:00,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they've already bypassed the move sales from what I remember as well.

527
00:38:01,288 --> 00:38:19,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, of course, Nintendo, um, they're saying that they sold a lot of DS's and Wii's during Black Friday, uh, might help that they also had a lot of, uh, new colors, uh, for different stuff, uh, coming out, new DSi XL colors, uh, I still don't understand why people go crazy about the colors, but whatever.

528
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:28,589
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the 25th Anniversary Red systems with Mario Kart in there.

529
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:34,312
[SPEAKER_07]: They also had the Red Weaves, which people are going crazy over for no apparent reason.

530
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:39,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Orange and Green systems with different games with that.

531
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:43,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, they sold 900,000 DS units.

532
00:38:43,636 --> 00:38:49,959
[SPEAKER_07]: That's DS, DS Lite, DS Lite XL, or DSi's, I guess.

533
00:38:50,960 --> 00:39:07,118
[SPEAKER_07]: and then of course 600,000 Wii's were sold and that's during the week of November 21st through the 27th that's really interesting about especially the number of Kinect sales I mean I'm hearing more people in the kind of the mass media quote-unquote

534
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,078
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

535
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:32,246
[SPEAKER_09]: and Nintendo did the same thing.

536
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,130
[SPEAKER_09]: We kind of think you're going to do the same thing with Kinect.

537
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,538
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't meet that goal, but it looks like the supply is actually meeting the demand a little bit.

538
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:40,181
[SPEAKER_07]: In certain markets, of course.

539
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:41,484
[SPEAKER_07]: How so?

540
00:39:41,980 --> 00:40:08,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because, you know, the smaller guys obviously aren't getting enough I'm sure as hell know we aren't getting enough shipments of that shit They're sending them all to retail, those fuckers So, yeah Well, they obviously are shipping them somewhere because they're selling those units, so I don't know They're still going for a pretty penny, though, on eBay, that's for sure

541
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:10,981
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

542
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:11,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

543
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:12,302
[SPEAKER_09]: How much?

544
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:14,423
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the reseller market look like on that?

545
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:15,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I remember with some of those things.

546
00:40:16,024 --> 00:40:16,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gosh.

547
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:19,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually $50 to $100 over retail.

548
00:40:20,347 --> 00:40:21,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going pretty good.

549
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:21,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

550
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:22,888
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

551
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:25,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's get into a big story from this week.

552
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:28,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

553
00:40:28,612 --> 00:40:31,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And Loki asked me before the show, why are we reporting on this?

554
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:31,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know.

555
00:40:32,074 --> 00:40:34,255
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the response to this is kind of funny.

556
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:35,336
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me tell you what's going on.

557
00:40:36,056 --> 00:40:38,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Peta decided to parody another game this week.

558
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:39,860
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they've done some video game parodies.

559
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:43,224
[SPEAKER_09]: They had like, I think there was like a Super Mario Brothers parody and some other crap too.

560
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:50,412
[SPEAKER_09]: But Super Meat Boy was the last game they set their eyes on and they decided to make this parody called Super Tofu Boy.

561
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:57,476
[SPEAKER_09]: and SuperTofuBoy is, you know, you play a chunk of tofu instead of a chunk of meat.

562
00:40:57,836 --> 00:41:00,678
[SPEAKER_09]: They've made Super Meat Boy the enemy in the game.

563
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:05,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, Meat Boy is a vengeful, bloody cube of rotting animal flesh and he smells.

564
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:14,184
[SPEAKER_09]: After a short-lived fling with Bandage Girl, he became enraged when he was dumped for the tasty and satisfying Tofu Boy, etc., etc.

565
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,725
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the blabber setup from the PETA game website.

566
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:17,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And the gameplay is...

567
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:24,168
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fairly similar to Super Meat Boy, but it's obviously a cheap hack.

568
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I shouldn't say a cheap hack.

569
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:32,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering how fast this must have turned around, it's a pretty decent hack, dare I say it?

570
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:36,993
[SPEAKER_09]: But whoever they've got programming the games at PETA seems to be pretty talented, like it or not.

571
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:38,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway...

572
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:40,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Meat Boy, Super Tofu Boy,

573
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:54,371
[SPEAKER_09]: None.

574
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:55,832
[SPEAKER_09]: PETA can't change anything.

575
00:41:57,193 --> 00:41:59,054
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty much their response to the whole thing.

576
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:00,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Not quite just that, though.

577
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:14,023
[SPEAKER_09]: If you read some of the other follow-up tweets and so on, apparently the guy who made Super Meat Boy went on to the PETA forums and posted under some different names to try to call attention to the game to, I guess, basically get free promotion.

578
00:42:14,603 --> 00:42:15,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And it worked!

579
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:17,166
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the crazy part.

580
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:21,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if he's making that up in retrospect, but I don't see why not.

581
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's actually kind of a smart thing to do.

582
00:42:22,951 --> 00:42:29,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh my god, can you believe they're making this game out of a moving piece of meat and glamorizing meat and meat is murder?

583
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:32,740
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's kind of funny.

584
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty, tasty murder.

585
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:38,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's really funny that it worked in so many ways.

586
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:51,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, now they've come out and said, well, since we were able to get basically free advertisement for Super Meat Boy, we're going to put Super Tofu Boy as an unlockable character in the PC version of the game.

587
00:42:52,715 --> 00:42:56,818
[SPEAKER_09]: So they came out and tweeted, if you type pedophile...

588
00:42:57,879 --> 00:43:05,649
[SPEAKER_09]: P-E-T-A-P-H-I-L-E at the character select screen, you will be able to play as Super Tofu Boy.

589
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, and I even made that joke earlier.

590
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:09,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea.

591
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:16,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Omicron says in here, the funny thing is that by Super Meat Boy creator's own admission, Meat Boy is a normal person without skin, not a hunk of meat.

592
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:19,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to screw up, PETA!

593
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:21,485
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a game, for heaven's sake.

594
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I love Super Meat Boy.

595
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,367
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great arcade game.

596
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:29,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I really think its only drawback is this whole, like, what?

597
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:31,090
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a piece of meat?

598
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I don't... That's your mark... What?

599
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:35,012
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the artwork?

600
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:35,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

601
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:37,033
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the name of your game, Super Meat Boy?

602
00:43:38,353 --> 00:43:39,394
[SPEAKER_09]: But whatever, I didn't make it.

603
00:43:40,902 --> 00:43:43,064
[SPEAKER_09]: People probably say the same thing about Orange Lounge Radio.

604
00:43:43,085 --> 00:43:45,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Why the hell do you call your video game show Orange Lounge Radio?

605
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:46,208
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not about oranges.

606
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:47,530
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not in Orange County.

607
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee makes a very good point and this is very true.

608
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:54,698
[SPEAKER_02]: PETA, we euthanize more animals than we take in even though we don't support euthanization.

609
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:56,239
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.

610
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they actually have to report all this stuff to the IRS.

611
00:43:59,443 --> 00:44:00,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of public record.

612
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:19,034
[SPEAKER_09]: by the way Edmund McMillan who is the co-creator of the game he admitted that he made fake usernames in PETA's forum pushing the game at them in hopes that something would happen PETA is 1000 times more well known than Super Meat Boy and the fact that they went out of their way to make a parody like this is beyond flattering and amazingly helpful

613
00:44:20,214 --> 00:44:32,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Edmund McMillan has said he was once a vegetarian and has worked as an animal control officer and he disagrees with PETA's total stance against the lab testing of animals and this is so interesting.

614
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:43,705
[SPEAKER_09]: He's saying that being against the lab testing of animals means you're against these medical discoveries and treatments that save lives like his mom who is diabetic and that's why he's against PETA.

615
00:44:44,085 --> 00:44:52,487
[SPEAKER_02]: The person right under the PETA lady, Ingrid Newkirk, is a diabetic who is on insulin made from dog testing.

616
00:44:53,308 --> 00:44:53,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

617
00:44:54,128 --> 00:44:54,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

618
00:44:54,948 --> 00:44:55,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

619
00:44:55,428 --> 00:44:56,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun double standard, right?

620
00:44:57,169 --> 00:45:01,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, why is it that this show keeps coming back to politics tonight?

621
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:06,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but I just found it very interesting that an author of a game trolled the PETA forums and got his way.

622
00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:08,372
[SPEAKER_09]: That's outstanding to me.

623
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,032
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

624
00:45:31,713 --> 00:45:36,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I should try to sing it because it's much prettier than I'm giving it credit for.

625
00:45:36,915 --> 00:45:37,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I can play a little clip.

626
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:40,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Not right now.

627
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:45,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been nominated for a Grammy.

628
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:53,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's under Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist category from the composer's debut album Calling All Dawns.

629
00:45:54,747 --> 00:45:55,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really pretty song.

630
00:45:55,928 --> 00:46:02,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been going around since they've included it with the Video Games Live.

631
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:05,632
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gorgeous.

632
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:06,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think it is.

633
00:46:06,593 --> 00:46:08,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that they win.

634
00:46:09,514 --> 00:46:10,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a little clip.

635
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:13,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of quiet.

636
00:46:13,776 --> 00:46:14,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

637
00:46:14,517 --> 00:46:15,197
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of quiet.

638
00:46:22,276 --> 00:46:29,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Civ 4 really did have this epic theme song to it, which obviously is this, and then Civ 5 just pales in comparison.

639
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:34,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Civ 5's a great game, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't really have quite the moving song that Civ 4 did, so...

640
00:46:35,931 --> 00:47:03,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to see that a video game song gets acknowledged with a Grammy nomination but here's the weird thing to me Civ 4 didn't like come out this year so it is not getting nominated because it's from Civ 4 it's getting nominated because Christopher Tinn ended up making an album that happened to come out in the past year that has this song on it so you wonder well did it get nominated because people knew the song already but Civ 4 is what a 4 or 5 year old game it wasn't nominated for a Grammy 4 or 5 years ago 2005 was it?

641
00:47:03,225 --> 00:47:03,345
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah

642
00:47:05,246 --> 00:47:34,413
[SPEAKER_09]: so it's it's kind of interesting that it took this long and you got to wonder that oh well maybe people knew about it from here who knows uh Black Wolf in our chat room wants to point out that Christopher Tinn the album was also nominated so no matter how people found it uh it's it's it and if you actually listen to the rest of the album itself it is a really good album you know it's not pop or rock it's very different it's a world kind of more um I don't want to say Enya but more of that it's PBS music

643
00:47:34,793 --> 00:47:35,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually.

644
00:47:36,694 --> 00:47:37,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not a bad thing.

645
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:41,958
[SPEAKER_09]: So, also, I like AkumaJP in our chatroom says, Lion King.

646
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:44,240
[SPEAKER_09]: It does kind of sound like the theme of the Lion King, doesn't it, a little bit?

647
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,861
[SPEAKER_09]: A little less Elton John, though?

648
00:47:46,762 --> 00:47:48,503
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like the freaking Avatar soundtrack.

649
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:49,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it?

650
00:47:49,724 --> 00:47:51,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never really listened to the Avatar soundtrack.

651
00:47:51,305 --> 00:47:52,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it that good?

652
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:54,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

653
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:58,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it had really pretty music in it, but it's the same type of the same theme.

654
00:47:59,091 --> 00:47:59,211
Hmm.

655
00:48:00,103 --> 00:48:05,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, I promised you guys that we were going to have an interview tonight, so we are going to give Nick a call.

656
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:15,136
[SPEAKER_09]: He is the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure, and I'm really excited to talk to him about the game and how we got him on the show and everything.

657
00:48:15,176 --> 00:48:15,997
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're calling him right now.

658
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:17,758
[SPEAKER_09]: This is totally live and unscripted.

659
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:18,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything could happen, guys.

660
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:24,444
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have questions, post them in our chat room at chat.orangelunchradio.com while we wait for him to pick up.

661
00:48:26,005 --> 00:48:27,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't it be funny if this went to voicemail?

662
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:28,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oops, I forgot.

663
00:48:28,928 --> 00:48:29,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

664
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:29,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

665
00:48:54,540 --> 00:49:00,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Our show was kind of founded on the games like Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania 2DX.

666
00:49:00,425 --> 00:49:02,707
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're definitely no stranger to happy hardcore.

667
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:04,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course we love kittens.

668
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:05,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Who doesn't?

669
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:11,154
[SPEAKER_09]: So this game kind of seemed to be almost the perfect game in a way.

670
00:49:11,255 --> 00:49:14,637
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to know, what inspired Techno Kitten Adventure, Nick?

671
00:49:15,979 --> 00:49:21,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I recently discovered happy hardcore, which is the greatest genre of all time.

672
00:49:21,904 --> 00:49:22,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And

673
00:49:23,845 --> 00:49:30,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Robot Unicorn Attack a while ago, and that kind of gave the idea to incorporate music into a game.

674
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:38,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But Robot Unicorn Attack didn't really have everything going to the music, it was more like a background sort of thing.

675
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I like kittens, as you said.

676
00:49:43,723 --> 00:49:44,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't?

677
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:46,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to incorporate all three things into one.

678
00:49:48,883 --> 00:49:52,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this the first game you've ever made or do you have other XNA games out there?

679
00:49:52,345 --> 00:49:53,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Or was this like your first adventure?

680
00:49:54,886 --> 00:49:56,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few more games out there.

681
00:49:57,146 --> 00:49:58,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are not very good.

682
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:00,928
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the better ones is Physics Sandbox 2.

683
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:04,689
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like Crayon Physics Deluxe.

684
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:07,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've played that.

685
00:50:07,153 --> 00:50:07,393
[SPEAKER_09]: A summer.

686
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:09,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't really spend too much time on it, though.

687
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the time when it's actually licensing the music.

688
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:29,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that was the next thing I had to ask you about.

689
00:50:29,411 --> 00:50:33,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you didn't make or write a song specifically for this game.

690
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:36,817
[SPEAKER_09]: You somehow licensed an existing song that's out there, right?

691
00:50:37,277 --> 00:50:42,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me how you got the song and found the song and got the song in the game, ultimately.

692
00:50:43,282 --> 00:50:46,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'd heard the song before, like a trance version.

693
00:50:47,665 --> 00:50:52,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I discovered the happy hardcore version, which is from a company in the UK.

694
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:55,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty popular over there, but non-existent in the USA.

695
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:01,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just contacted them and paid a fee and got to use it for the game.

696
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:02,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

697
00:51:02,613 --> 00:51:06,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And that song, of course, is Frisco with Sea of Love is the song.

698
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:08,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, DJ Hicks' remix.

699
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:15,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I don't know if you're allowed to tell us, so you can pass on this question if you want, but do they get a cut of the profits because you used the song?

700
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to have to pass.

701
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if I can answer that.

702
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,100
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

703
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:21,560
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

704
00:51:22,981 --> 00:51:24,001
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the possibilities?

705
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:26,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me back up a little bit.

706
00:51:26,262 --> 00:51:28,262
[SPEAKER_09]: How successful has this game been for you?

707
00:51:28,702 --> 00:51:35,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know you're only charging a dollar for it, but I also noticed it was in the top 50 indie games, which has got to be a hard place to get to.

708
00:51:35,604 --> 00:51:38,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So has this game been pretty successful for you money-wise?

709
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:42,126
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually been less successful than my other games.

710
00:51:42,586 --> 00:51:42,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

711
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:43,647
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think they were...

712
00:51:45,765 --> 00:51:50,988
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot more appropriate for the audience that goes to indie games, which seems to be like 13-year-olds.

713
00:51:52,149 --> 00:51:52,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, wait a minute!

714
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:56,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

715
00:51:57,272 --> 00:52:00,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so it hasn't been as successful as Share the Games.

716
00:52:00,254 --> 00:52:04,017
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really interesting, but definitely there's been an audience for it.

717
00:52:04,137 --> 00:52:06,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, do you plan to do anything else with this idea?

718
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:15,224
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to port it to Windows Phone 7, iPhone, and Android probably within the next three months.

719
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get it on my phone.

720
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:42,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, not bad for a bunch of 13-year-olds.

721
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:45,774
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them's got their own company somewhere that's going to help you out.

722
00:52:46,094 --> 00:52:51,396
[SPEAKER_09]: What about, you know, I've got to ask about a potential sequel to Techno Kitten Adventure.

723
00:52:51,476 --> 00:52:53,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a Techno Kitten Adventure 2 in the works?

724
00:52:53,977 --> 00:52:54,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Electric Boogaloo?

725
00:52:54,997 --> 00:53:00,659
[SPEAKER_05]: The company that contacted me said that depending on how well it does, they'll probably think about making a sequel.

726
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it'll be the same genre of music.

727
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,502
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, I'd like it to be some more happy hardcore, but we'll see.

728
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:08,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll probably be a different genre.

729
00:53:09,096 --> 00:53:10,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I started off just wanting to make

730
00:53:35,183 --> 00:53:58,219
[SPEAKER_05]: and then have Happy Hardcore playing in the background kind of make it like Robot Unicorn Attack and then while I was doing that I made a few effects on accident that worked really well with the music and so I decided to have everything sync up with it which took like listening to the song a few hundred times unfortunately to get it right but you love Happy Hardcore so it's okay right?

731
00:53:58,908 --> 00:54:00,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's actually still a good song.

732
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:02,309
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how great of a song it is.

733
00:54:23,775 --> 00:54:25,636
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got to be careful, Nick, not to jump the shark.

734
00:54:26,117 --> 00:54:27,538
[SPEAKER_09]: So enjoy this.

735
00:54:27,558 --> 00:54:28,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played the metal version.

736
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:30,100
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucked pretty bad.

737
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:30,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

738
00:54:30,941 --> 00:54:32,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you do a techno shark.

739
00:54:33,863 --> 00:54:35,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Techno sharks with lasers adventures.

740
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:35,864
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

741
00:54:36,425 --> 00:54:44,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a couple more questions for you, and that is, are you thinking, though, I know you've got the company that wants to do other things with this title and so forth.

742
00:54:45,231 --> 00:54:49,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think maybe you're going to do another game that really has nothing to do with this whatsoever?

743
00:54:50,075 --> 00:54:55,358
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just kind of a one-off thing, and you have other games you want to do, or do you want to kind of play this out and see where it goes?

744
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:03,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now I'm working on a music-based shoot-'em-up, which is going to be way more gameplay-based, rather than a simple one-button game.

745
00:55:04,564 --> 00:55:05,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, very cool.

746
00:55:06,305 --> 00:55:08,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you can say about that right now, or is it all still in the works?

747
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:16,351
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much going to be a music visualizer going in the background, and then just really hardcore shoot-'em-ups.

748
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:19,136
[SPEAKER_05]: and a couple other bullet holes sort of thing.

749
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:38,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at it quite a bit, actually.

750
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:39,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and what do you think?

751
00:55:39,765 --> 00:55:39,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

752
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them just say that it looks like it was made in MS Paint.

753
00:56:05,893 --> 00:56:08,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really read anything that horrified me.

754
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:31,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Haters to the left.

755
00:56:31,798 --> 00:56:32,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Haters to the left.

756
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:33,039
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

757
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of think the art style, in a way, is kind of part of the charm.

758
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:43,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, if it had been all, like, 3D, HD, Uber effects, I don't think it would really be the same thing.

759
00:56:44,482 --> 00:56:45,082
[SPEAKER_09]: That make sense?

760
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:47,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I say, you go.

761
00:56:48,203 --> 00:56:50,884
[SPEAKER_09]: And good luck with all those future projects.

762
00:56:51,184 --> 00:56:53,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to plug here on our little show?

763
00:56:53,924 --> 00:56:55,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Of upcoming projects or what have you?

764
00:56:55,265 --> 00:56:55,445
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thanks.

765
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:56,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

766
00:56:57,005 --> 00:56:58,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the game... You have a website or anything?

767
00:56:58,726 --> 00:56:59,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Official website for...

768
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:01,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at the moment.

769
00:57:01,311 --> 00:57:04,432
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be a website and it'll work.

770
00:57:04,572 --> 00:57:06,954
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let you guys know about it when Nick tells us about it.

771
00:57:07,314 --> 00:57:15,619
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is Technokitten Adventures and it's available right now on the Xbox Live Indie Games.

772
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:20,602
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one whole dollar, which is really not a bad price at all.

773
00:57:21,782 --> 00:57:22,983
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cost of a taco.

774
00:57:23,283 --> 00:57:27,666
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said earlier in the show, technically on Sundays it's the cost of three tacos.

775
00:57:28,426 --> 00:57:31,909
[SPEAKER_02]: A taco is for a moment, but techno kittens are forever.

776
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:32,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having me.

777
00:57:52,226 --> 00:57:52,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I will.

778
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:53,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thank you.

779
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:53,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night.

780
00:57:53,827 --> 00:57:54,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

781
00:57:55,447 --> 00:57:55,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

782
00:57:56,027 --> 00:58:02,990
[SPEAKER_09]: From tweet to call on the show, Techno Kitten Adventure, Nick from Techno Kitten Adventure.

783
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,030
[SPEAKER_09]: He didn't tell me his last name, but we'll give him a little bit of anonymity.

784
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:08,251
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not real ID here on the show after all.

785
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:10,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to Nick for being such a good sport.

786
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:15,874
[SPEAKER_09]: And Zom in our chatroom says, if you have $2, you can have Techno Kittens and a taco.

787
00:58:16,814 --> 00:58:20,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, in this economy, in this economy, it might be tough.

788
00:58:20,175 --> 00:58:20,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And

789
00:58:20,555 --> 00:58:21,676
[SPEAKER_02]: That's value!

790
00:58:23,278 --> 00:58:23,538
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

791
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on to more stories.

792
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:29,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, release dates.

793
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,185
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time for to get to the show.

794
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:37,811
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't want to get Techno Kitten Adventure or you've already bought it and you want to look at other games, there's other stuff coming to a store near you, right, Loki?

795
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:44,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and this will probably be the last week that stuff will be coming to a store near you, at least this year, because...

796
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:47,178
[SPEAKER_07]: It is dying down to zero.

797
00:58:47,379 --> 00:58:50,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, literally, I think the week after next, there's one game.

798
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:53,662
[SPEAKER_07]: And the week after that, possibly another game.

799
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:54,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

800
00:58:56,523 --> 00:59:03,267
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, next week, though, the kind of coincide with it's a little bit early with the launch of the new Tron movie.

801
00:59:03,547 --> 00:59:29,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Tron Evolution it's going to be kind of a prequel to Tron Legacy and that'll be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and then they're going to be doing kind of an arena based sort of combat game it's Tron Legacy Battle Grid and that's coming out on the Wii oh and I guess it's also on PC as well

802
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely check that out.

803
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:31,548
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks pretty exciting.

804
00:59:32,429 --> 00:59:38,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and then the Tron Battle Grids, I believe, is also on DS and possibly PSP.

805
00:59:39,095 --> 00:59:46,763
[SPEAKER_07]: SBKX Superbike World Championship on PlayStation 3 and I believe Xbox 360 as well.

806
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to be kind of a street bike racing game.

807
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:52,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Yogi Bear, the video game.

808
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:55,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

809
00:59:56,019 --> 00:59:57,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that movie tanks.

810
00:59:57,864 --> 00:59:59,690
[SPEAKER_09]: But sadly there's kids that are going to want to see it.

811
01:00:00,031 --> 01:00:02,252
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, kind of a bit of a side note here.

812
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:05,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got an invite and I can't go to it.

813
01:00:05,633 --> 01:00:07,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me put it this way.

814
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:09,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to it.

815
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:14,596
[SPEAKER_07]: For a Nielsen screening of a summer movie that's coming out next year.

816
01:00:15,096 --> 01:00:17,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a computer animated comedy.

817
01:00:17,496 --> 01:00:21,738
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't happen to be sitting in the middle of summer as a computer animated comedy.

818
01:00:22,778 --> 01:00:23,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Smurfs the movie.

819
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:24,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no.

820
01:00:24,379 --> 01:00:24,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck no.

821
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:28,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so they don't tell you what the movie is.

822
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:29,568
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't tell me what the movie is.

823
01:00:30,289 --> 01:00:33,111
[SPEAKER_02]: You should go see it just to poop on it.

824
01:00:33,191 --> 01:00:40,156
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because Nellie's like, if you leave me with the baby all night long to go see Smurfs the movie, I'm going to kill you.

825
01:00:40,897 --> 01:00:41,997
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fair.

826
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:42,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That is fair.

827
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:45,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Sniper Elite Sniper Elite Sniper Elite

828
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:22,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, not to get too tangenty, but I've had not one, but several friends tell me that the Smurf Village game on the phone, iPhone, which is by Capcom, is actually really good for the whole, like, we rule Farmville-y, you know, Facebook-y type of game on your phone.

829
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:24,328
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not touching that game.

830
01:01:24,529 --> 01:01:26,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw it, I was like, you know, I could download it for free.

831
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:29,070
[SPEAKER_07]: and check it out and see if it's any good.

832
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,771
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not even going to check it out to see if it's any good.

833
01:01:31,811 --> 01:01:32,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

834
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:37,072
[SPEAKER_07]: The only Smurfs game I've played and will only play is the one on the ColecoVision.

835
01:01:37,092 --> 01:01:38,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.

836
01:01:38,212 --> 01:01:39,592
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one where you can get her naked.

837
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:40,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Smurfette naked.

838
01:01:41,293 --> 01:01:41,833
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a bug.

839
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:48,914
[SPEAKER_09]: You go backwards or something instead of going forwards at the very end and there's a bug where Smurfette gets naked.

840
01:01:49,034 --> 01:01:49,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this game.

841
01:01:50,595 --> 01:01:50,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

842
01:01:51,235 --> 01:01:52,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a ColecoVision in the game.

843
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:57,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Smurfs when I was like 4 or 5 years old.

844
01:01:57,078 --> 01:01:58,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a huge fan of the Smurfs.

845
01:01:58,479 --> 01:01:59,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to tell you this.

846
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:07,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Becky just told me Julian and I saw the preview for Yogi Bear and he said it looked stupid and he's 3 and a half.

847
01:02:09,327 --> 01:02:11,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Julian should be the official movie critic of Orange Lounge Radio.

848
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:12,629
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

849
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

850
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,411
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the official child of Orange Lounge Radio.

851
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,653
[SPEAKER_07]: During Tron, they're going to have the new Transformers 3 trailers.

852
01:02:18,673 --> 01:02:20,475
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be interesting.

853
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay.

854
01:02:22,721 --> 01:02:25,182
[SPEAKER_07]: This other game coming out, uh, Touchmaster... Wait, wait, hold on.

855
01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:25,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, sorry.

856
01:02:25,823 --> 01:02:26,983
[SPEAKER_09]: This is really important, though, okay?

857
01:02:27,524 --> 01:02:29,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, it was on the Atari 2600 and the ColecoVision.

858
01:02:29,845 --> 01:02:34,628
[SPEAKER_09]: The ColecoVision version of Smurf, Rescue, and Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg or programming error.

859
01:02:34,988 --> 01:02:38,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Upon reaching Smurfette's screen, the player can return to the previous screen.

860
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:40,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Just before the screen changes...

861
01:02:40,911 --> 01:02:45,716
[SPEAKER_09]: It will appear as though the top of Smurfette's dress comes off, making her appear topless.

862
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:48,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Two of the background music tracks are simple, you know, whatever.

863
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:49,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares about the music?

864
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,183
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, Smurfette gets topless if you go backwards.

865
01:02:52,243 --> 01:02:54,986
[SPEAKER_09]: If you leave her ass, she'll show her titties to get you to come back.

866
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:58,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

867
01:02:58,649 --> 01:02:59,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Loki.

868
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,371
[SPEAKER_09]: It was worth reporting.

869
01:03:00,391 --> 01:03:01,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was worth reporting.

870
01:03:01,492 --> 01:03:02,934
[SPEAKER_02]: You know when she made She Was Evil?

871
01:03:04,253 --> 01:03:18,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Touchmaster Connect it's all those wonderful bar games that they have what makes it unique compared to some of the other ones you can share your scores via Twitter and Facebook using this DS title so that's kind of neat I guess Yu-Gi-Oh!

872
01:03:19,364 --> 01:03:31,412
[SPEAKER_07]: 50s Dual Transfer coming out on the Wii and how can we not forget World of Warcraft Cataclysm the new expansion coming out on PC what did Nick say DarkSakura?

873
01:03:31,572 --> 01:03:32,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Haters gonna hate

874
01:03:32,933 --> 01:03:33,834
[SPEAKER_09]: No barfing over there.

875
01:03:34,734 --> 01:03:36,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, let's see.

876
01:03:38,176 --> 01:03:41,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Bejeweled 3 on PC is pretty awesome.

877
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:48,782
[SPEAKER_07]: New You Fitness, First Yoga and Pilates on the Wii.

878
01:03:49,062 --> 01:03:50,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I must have had something in my throat there.

879
01:03:50,863 --> 01:03:54,945
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, a week from today, Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition for the Wii.

880
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,106
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a Super Nintendo game!

881
01:03:57,206 --> 01:03:59,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, are you going to pay Nintendo?

882
01:03:59,688 --> 01:04:02,829
[SPEAKER_07]: They did nothing to the game other than make it work with the controls.

883
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:06,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're going to pay them $30?

884
01:04:10,273 --> 01:04:10,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

885
01:04:12,074 --> 01:04:13,075
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's what you really want.

886
01:04:13,315 --> 01:04:15,036
[SPEAKER_09]: But it comes in a shiny box.

887
01:04:15,056 --> 01:04:17,077
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what kind of a message you're sending Nintendo?

888
01:04:17,237 --> 01:04:18,818
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll buy anything that you sell!

889
01:04:19,645 --> 01:04:23,528
[SPEAKER_09]: and then it's going to be remade in 3D and be $35 on the 3DS.

890
01:04:23,648 --> 01:04:23,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait.

891
01:04:24,629 --> 01:04:25,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait for it.

892
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:27,931
[SPEAKER_07]: There's better ROM hacks out there.

893
01:04:28,051 --> 01:04:28,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what was it?

894
01:04:28,672 --> 01:04:29,833
[SPEAKER_07]: New Super Mario Bros.

895
01:04:29,853 --> 01:04:29,833
3.

896
01:04:29,993 --> 01:04:30,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that?

897
01:04:30,773 --> 01:04:36,218
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole, they completely re-edited the levels for the DS version to Super Mario Bros.

898
01:04:36,238 --> 01:04:38,960
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 and bonus levels and added all these challenge maps and stuff.

899
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,661
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's a value right there.

900
01:04:40,681 --> 01:04:45,024
[SPEAKER_07]: If they put that on a cartridge, I'd buy that shit in no time, but I'm sorry.

901
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:45,945
[SPEAKER_07]: They did nothing.

902
01:04:45,985 --> 01:04:47,246
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't even try to make it

903
01:04:47,446 --> 01:04:48,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Zuma Blitz Zuma Blitz

904
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:20,628
[SPEAKER_09]: um it's actually pretty good uh it's pretty addicting and you know it's free they have their whole like you can buy things to unlock more special blah blah blahs but as far as the whole like competing with your friends for high scores and so on you know it's it's it's cool it's just like the bejeweled one

905
01:05:20,828 --> 01:05:21,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Or here's something even better.

906
01:05:22,129 --> 01:05:27,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I know that the stuff is already available on the virtual console and stuff like that.

907
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:28,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

908
01:05:28,671 --> 01:05:30,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they've got a whole damn disc.

909
01:05:30,532 --> 01:05:35,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you right now this image of this disc is probably going to be like a few megs and that's it.

910
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:37,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And the rest is just all blank space or filler or whatever.

911
01:05:38,395 --> 01:05:41,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, why didn't they put like...

912
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:44,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2 on there.

913
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:46,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Mario 64.

914
01:05:47,061 --> 01:05:48,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it worthwhile.

915
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:51,825
[SPEAKER_07]: And hell, you could even charge 50 bucks for it at that point.

916
01:05:52,205 --> 01:05:54,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's full of all the Mario games.

917
01:05:56,349 --> 01:05:57,790
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, it's just Mario All-Stars.

918
01:05:58,266 --> 01:05:59,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe there's an unlockable.

919
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:01,488
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's not an unlockable.

920
01:06:01,848 --> 01:06:05,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there'll be an unlockable, all right, and guess what it'll be?

921
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:05,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Demos.

922
01:06:07,411 --> 01:06:08,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Virtual console demos.

923
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:09,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you like these games?

924
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,613
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get them in their original form on the virtual console.

925
01:06:13,863 --> 01:06:15,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else for this week, Loki?

926
01:06:39,516 --> 01:06:55,084
[SPEAKER_09]: on the PlayStation 3, also Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, price reduction on End of Eternity, a game called Free Free Bowling, which I'm thinking is the Move bowling game localized for Japan, and a USB Neo Geo pad from SNK Play More comes out this week.

927
01:06:55,505 --> 01:07:03,129
[SPEAKER_09]: It is basically a Neo Geo pad with six buttons for fighting games, probably for use with some of the Neo Geo games that are on PlayStation Network.

928
01:07:04,529 --> 01:07:10,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Going over to the Nintendo Wii this week in Japan, Donkey Kong Returns makes its way out.

929
01:07:11,534 --> 01:07:13,595
[SPEAKER_09]: For once, we got a game about a week before they did.

930
01:07:14,055 --> 01:07:26,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Fitness Party also comes out from Namco Bandai, and a karaoke game called Karaoke Joy Sound Wii Super DX Hitori de Mina de Utai Hodai comes out from Hudson this week.

931
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:28,164
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a hell of a name there.

932
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:30,780
[SPEAKER_02]: The name doesn't quite make sense to me.

933
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitori de Mina?

934
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,682
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like... Okay.

935
01:07:34,902 --> 01:07:42,946
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks a little bit like Karaoke Revolution meets once in a while the actual music video, but otherwise it's party girls dancing on a stage.

936
01:07:43,446 --> 01:07:46,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I don't even... I can't even... Is there para para?

937
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:47,709
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no para para.

938
01:07:48,469 --> 01:07:48,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Not worth it.

939
01:07:49,249 --> 01:07:50,290
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Pac-Man Party?

940
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:51,951
[SPEAKER_09]: That is also coming out in Japan this week.

941
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:54,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And Boom Blox gets a price reduction in Japan.

942
01:07:54,412 --> 01:07:54,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops!

943
01:07:54,872 --> 01:07:55,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, that's the 16th.

944
01:07:55,973 --> 01:07:56,533
[SPEAKER_09]: That's next week.

945
01:07:56,753 --> 01:07:56,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

946
01:07:58,254 --> 01:08:00,676
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me keep going with this week on the Nintendo DS.

947
01:08:01,116 --> 01:08:05,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow gets a price reduction, so does Ganbare Goemon.

948
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,023
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as new games, though, one of the ones you might want to check out is Ni no Kuni.

949
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:12,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Shikoku no Madoushi comes out this week.

950
01:08:13,186 --> 01:08:20,833
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an RPG from level 5, and damn it, I think this is out here in the U.S.

951
01:08:20,873 --> 01:08:22,354
[SPEAKER_09]: is something else, and I can't tell what it is.

952
01:08:24,076 --> 01:08:31,071
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's an RPG from level 5 in Japan I'm sure somebody in the chat room will correct me soon enough there's actually an official website for it should I look at it real quick?

953
01:08:32,338 --> 01:08:33,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a pretty big DS title.

954
01:08:35,019 --> 01:08:36,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe somebody in chat knows the rest.

955
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:46,962
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as the Sony PSP goes, not a lot of big stuff this week, although there's some price reductions on things like Valkyria Chronicles 2 and Kurogani no Line Barrels Hudson the Best.

956
01:08:47,602 --> 01:08:49,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you know what this game is?

957
01:08:50,343 --> 01:08:54,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe this is the DS game that's made with Studio Ghibli.

958
01:08:54,844 --> 01:08:55,685
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what this is.

959
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:59,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the artwork looks very... very...

960
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:01,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that.

961
01:09:01,466 --> 01:09:02,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what this is.

962
01:09:03,107 --> 01:09:05,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think it is out here in the US, but I think I've read about it.

963
01:09:05,628 --> 01:09:06,768
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why it sounds familiar to me.

964
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:07,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, look at it.

965
01:09:07,569 --> 01:09:08,849
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks like Studio Ghibli, doesn't it?

966
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:10,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is.

967
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,831
[SPEAKER_09]: With a little guy with a lantern on his nose and everything.

968
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:14,051
[SPEAKER_09]: That's got to be what this is.

969
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:16,852
[SPEAKER_07]: No other studio puts lanterns on their nose.

970
01:09:16,872 --> 01:09:18,193
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no other studio would do that.

971
01:09:19,284 --> 01:09:19,724
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

972
01:09:19,805 --> 01:09:20,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

973
01:09:20,205 --> 01:09:22,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat room's jumping in there saying yes to Studio Ghibli.

974
01:09:22,907 --> 01:09:26,030
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the one with the huge 300-page magic book, says Dungeon Buster.

975
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

976
01:09:26,991 --> 01:09:28,112
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured it out eventually.

977
01:09:28,132 --> 01:09:28,832
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

978
01:09:29,113 --> 01:09:30,314
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

979
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:34,726
[SPEAKER_02]: In the UK, we have a number of games, although not many.

980
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:41,149
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 7th is Alien Breed 2 Assault and Bejeweled 3 and World of Warcraft Cataclysm.

981
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:41,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

982
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:42,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.

983
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,651
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 8th is Bomberman Live Battlefest.

984
01:09:46,351 --> 01:09:51,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the 10th, we have Cave Story and Golden Sun, Dark Dawn.

985
01:09:52,934 --> 01:09:52,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

986
01:09:56,044 --> 01:10:22,068
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's about it alright not a bad week all things considered I mean considering we're getting really close to Christmas I mean whether DarkSakura likes it or not Warcraft's gonna be a huge game and hey there's Tron and there's I don't give a crap about Warcraft Warcraft I mean to be honest I just do it to give you a hard time there's Plants vs. Zombies is in it now that's all I'm saying I just like giving you a hard time about it I know you do mwah mwah mwah

987
01:10:23,489 --> 01:10:51,228
[SPEAKER_07]: a couple more new stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week yes so this is kind of cool you know and they were talking about possibly making a game based on this but now it's been confirmed that Christopher Nolan is actually working on an Inception video game and I think that's really cool love the world of Inception love the movie I still haven't seen it oh

988
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:54,111
[SPEAKER_09]: But it comes out on Blu-ray this week, so I plan to rent it.

989
01:10:54,371 --> 01:10:54,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

990
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:55,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

991
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:56,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not watch anything else.

992
01:10:56,533 --> 01:11:04,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm sitting here going, all I know is that there's a room spinny thing that might be cool in a video game, but otherwise I don't know why this would make a good video game.

993
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:07,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you tell me why this is going to be an awesome video game without spoiling the movie?

994
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:08,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

995
01:11:08,905 --> 01:11:12,248

01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:17,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Except the MMO sucked, like The Matrix.

997
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Why The Matrix was kind of a cool movie.

998
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,828
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really the environment of it and everything.

999
01:11:22,248 --> 01:11:23,748
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a really neat concept.

1000
01:11:23,848 --> 01:11:28,969
[SPEAKER_09]: The Matrix game that was on GameCube and PS2 was not as terrible as I think some made it out to be.

1001
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:29,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it this way.

1002
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:34,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Inception has that vibe of the first Matrix movie.

1003
01:11:34,171 --> 01:11:35,131
[SPEAKER_07]: They set up a world.

1004
01:11:35,571 --> 01:11:36,071
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of...

1005
01:11:36,731 --> 01:11:37,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1006
01:12:05,476 --> 01:12:05,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1007
01:12:06,057 --> 01:12:06,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1008
01:12:06,557 --> 01:12:08,158
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the kid from Third Rock from the Sun.

1009
01:12:08,539 --> 01:12:12,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Or he was also the kid in Dark Shadows years and years ago.

1010
01:12:12,442 --> 01:12:13,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever see the movie Brick?

1011
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,064
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to see Brick.

1012
01:12:16,185 --> 01:12:17,025
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't seen Brick.

1013
01:12:17,065 --> 01:12:20,608
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was in some other movie I saw called Mysterious Skin.

1014
01:12:21,249 --> 01:12:22,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And I kind of felt dirty.

1015
01:12:22,369 --> 01:12:24,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, this is the guy from Third Rock?

1016
01:12:24,411 --> 01:12:25,492
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a really good actor nowadays.

1017
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:26,213
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a pretty good actor.

1018
01:12:26,493 --> 01:12:30,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Mysterious Skin was by the guy, and he does all these messed up teen angst movies.

1019
01:12:30,778 --> 01:12:36,664
[SPEAKER_09]: He did like the Nowhere, I think was one, and was totally fucked up, and there's another one in that whole series.

1020
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,547
[SPEAKER_09]: All those teen angst movies, and he did that too.

1021
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:42,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so he's an awesome character.

1022
01:12:42,448 --> 01:12:44,209
[SPEAKER_07]: He plays a really awesome character in the movie.

1023
01:12:44,369 --> 01:12:46,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, DiCaprio's alright.

1024
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:52,752
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, seriously, the movie Brick, though, it's a film noir set in a high school.

1025
01:12:53,873 --> 01:12:54,793
[SPEAKER_07]: In modern-day high school.

1026
01:12:55,233 --> 01:12:56,774
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really awesome.

1027
01:12:56,794 --> 01:12:58,895
[SPEAKER_07]: All the dialogue, though, is film noir.

1028
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:01,477
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just so badass.

1029
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:03,299
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta see it.

1030
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,101
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really cool.

1031
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:05,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take your word for it.

1032
01:13:05,462 --> 01:13:07,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Inception, amazing movie.

1033
01:13:08,066 --> 01:13:13,392
[SPEAKER_07]: So the video game, you know, games based off movies aren't that great all the time.

1034
01:13:13,793 --> 01:13:16,817
[SPEAKER_07]: But if Christopher Nolan's actually working on it, maybe it'll...

1035
01:13:18,258 --> 01:13:18,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Do all right.

1036
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:33,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, he says now he was considering putting together a video game based on the movie, but it looks like his plans are going a little bit further than that.

1037
01:13:33,262 --> 01:13:42,584
[SPEAKER_07]: He says he's told Entertainment Weekly that the project is a go and that he's working with a full team on the game as a longer-term proposition.

1038
01:13:43,584 --> 01:13:48,528
[SPEAKER_07]: He's excited to explore the medium of gaming by creating a new story set in the world of the movie.

1039
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:55,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Entertainment Weekly suggests an MMO, but hopefully it's something better than that.

1040
01:13:57,995 --> 01:13:58,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1041
01:13:58,636 --> 01:14:05,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see an MMO, but the problem I see with an MMO, though, is that you remember the Matrix Online.

1042
01:14:05,461 --> 01:14:07,423
[SPEAKER_09]: The Matrix Online just had some flaws.

1043
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,805
[SPEAKER_09]: The Matrix could have made an awesome MMO.

1044
01:14:10,425 --> 01:14:12,687
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that what they released wasn't it.

1045
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:15,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like the Wachowski brothers could have made an awesome trilogy.

1046
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:19,321
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're like, let's give you all these powers all of a sudden.

1047
01:14:20,162 --> 01:14:21,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he's too powerful.

1048
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:23,445
[SPEAKER_09]: To this day, I've never seen the third movie.

1049
01:14:23,985 --> 01:14:25,707
[SPEAKER_09]: To this day, I've never seen the third movie.

1050
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:26,921
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not missing much.

1051
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:30,682
[SPEAKER_02]: It has an ending reminiscent of Highlander 2, which was also a crappy movie.

1052
01:14:30,802 --> 01:14:31,442
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I hear.

1053
01:14:31,882 --> 01:14:34,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, but didn't Highlander 2, wasn't that the one that introduced Sean Connery?

1054
01:14:34,423 --> 01:14:35,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Or was he in the first one too, and I just forgot?

1055
01:14:35,663 --> 01:14:36,123
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one.

1056
01:14:36,504 --> 01:14:37,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, he was Ramirez.

1057
01:14:38,124 --> 01:14:38,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot.

1058
01:14:38,664 --> 01:14:40,565
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how many years it's been since I've seen Highlander?

1059
01:14:41,065 --> 01:14:43,705
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like in college, where everybody got high and watched Highlander.

1060
01:14:43,765 --> 01:14:46,726
[SPEAKER_09]: But I didn't, because I'm... It's called Highlander, man.

1061
01:14:46,746 --> 01:14:48,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta watch it high.

1062
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:52,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to Chico State, folks.

1063
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:52,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough said.

1064
01:14:53,048 --> 01:14:53,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough said.

1065
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:55,921
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1066
01:15:20,638 --> 01:15:21,199
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1067
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:43,500
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1068
01:16:03,015 --> 01:16:17,003
[SPEAKER_09]: There is the possibility there that there will be interactive elements into shows viewed on the console and that there'll be also content silos, meaning that like HBO and Showtime could have their own little areas to subscribe to.

1069
01:16:17,524 --> 01:16:18,904
[SPEAKER_09]: So could be interesting.

1070
01:16:19,705 --> 01:16:24,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I like this because remember when I talked about the whole 1 versus 100 getting canceled, I was like...

1071
01:16:25,288 --> 01:16:28,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Why doesn't Xbox make more of a network?

1072
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:29,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I was kind of talking about this.

1073
01:16:29,992 --> 01:16:35,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I like this whole idea of interactivity or more interactive shows.

1074
01:16:35,697 --> 01:16:45,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Xbox had a great thing with 1 vs. 100 and it's a damn shame that they lost the rights to the new Game Show Network version or whatever the hell it is that's going on.

1075
01:16:45,386 --> 01:16:49,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, have you seen the new Game Show Network version with Carrie Ann Inaba as the host?

1076
01:16:49,089 --> 01:16:49,129
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1077
01:16:49,529 --> 01:16:52,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not as fun as it was on Xbox Live, sorry to say.

1078
01:16:54,673 --> 01:16:56,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually really into something like this.

1079
01:16:56,394 --> 01:16:58,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope the interactive stuff isn't cheesy.

1080
01:16:59,136 --> 01:17:07,501
[SPEAKER_09]: You see a lot of Blu-ray discs that have the interactive movie component, which is just asking dumb poll questions and things.

1081
01:17:07,601 --> 01:17:11,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see them do more interactive game shows.

1082
01:17:11,424 --> 01:17:15,487
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had the rumor of a Poker Night game that's apparently in top secret testing right now.

1083
01:17:16,087 --> 01:17:18,629
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe there's a show to be made of that?

1084
01:17:18,869 --> 01:17:19,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1085
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,870
[SPEAKER_09]: What if you could vote on the ending?

1086
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:26,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Vote on a character getting killed off or what have you.

1087
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:28,852
[SPEAKER_09]: American Idol being voted on through your Xbox.

1088
01:17:28,913 --> 01:17:30,513
[SPEAKER_09]: X Factor on Xbox.

1089
01:17:30,553 --> 01:17:36,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think if anything what the interactive part might be is like marking clips or something like that and sharing them with friends.

1090
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:38,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Say, hey, have you seen this?

1091
01:17:38,616 --> 01:17:39,416
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty cool.

1092
01:17:40,517 --> 01:17:41,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, look, it's a nipple slip.

1093
01:17:45,307 --> 01:17:48,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, so you think this is more like a TiVo that you could share?

1094
01:17:49,089 --> 01:17:55,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's ever another Janet Jackson boobie that slips out, people could be like, hey, I saw this awesome clip and wanted to share it with my friends.

1095
01:17:55,273 --> 01:18:01,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's like, I guess, Justin TV, where you can save clips and stuff like that.

1096
01:18:01,217 --> 01:18:03,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God, I hope we're not going to be lifecasting through our Xbox.

1097
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:05,239
[SPEAKER_09]: There's certain people I don't want...

1098
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,481
[SPEAKER_09]: to see their lives.

1099
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:12,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the Kinect is putting a camera in all of our homes, but this is not an idea I like.

1100
01:18:13,185 --> 01:18:28,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, oh my God, could you imagine like now when they do one versus a hundred, like with two and a half million Kinects out there and growing, they could have the one be on TV with the whole Kinect thing, which is a nice little camera in your house.

1101
01:18:30,296 --> 01:18:30,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1102
01:18:30,636 --> 01:18:31,437
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alive.

1103
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:31,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1104
01:18:35,242 --> 01:18:39,146
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the Xbox 720 will just be called Skynet.

1105
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:42,129
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where we go from here, right?

1106
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:49,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to chime in on this live with us.

1107
01:18:50,196 --> 01:18:53,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, isn't Sky a service that's in the UK?

1108
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And technically, isn't it a network?

1109
01:18:58,294 --> 01:18:59,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen this boy?

1110
01:19:00,496 --> 01:19:04,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Ezam in our chatroom says, that's the new show on Current TV, Bar Karma.

1111
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Viewers make the story and they produce it.

1112
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, here's a question.

1113
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:09,264
[SPEAKER_07]: This is totally random.

1114
01:19:09,885 --> 01:19:16,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got to have this, like some sort of Photoshopped, you know, have you seen this boy with Pedobear?

1115
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:19,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it exists somewhere.

1116
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:19,914
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be funny.

1117
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:20,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1118
01:19:23,461 --> 01:19:25,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, the name that I can never pronounce.

1119
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:29,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Majinamicon in our chatroom says, DC figured out a way to capitalize on this.

1120
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:33,366
[SPEAKER_09]: They announced a telephone poll for readers to decide whether he lived or died.

1121
01:19:33,386 --> 01:19:33,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason Todd.

1122
01:19:34,087 --> 01:19:36,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, 10,000 votes later, he was dead.

1123
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:37,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone hated Jason Todd.

1124
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:40,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?

1125
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:40,951
[SPEAKER_02]: He's live again.

1126
01:19:41,351 --> 01:19:41,732
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1127
01:19:41,772 --> 01:19:45,375
[SPEAKER_09]: They did that in the 70s with Andy Kaufman on Saturday Night Live.

1128
01:19:45,795 --> 01:19:47,637
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if that's really... Remember?

1129
01:19:48,057 --> 01:19:50,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know none of you were alive when this happened.

1130
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:50,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that.

1131
01:19:50,939 --> 01:19:53,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it was 10 years before I was born.

1132
01:19:54,102 --> 01:19:55,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't in the Man on the Moon movie?

1133
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:55,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1134
01:19:55,984 --> 01:20:01,228
[SPEAKER_09]: But they did a whole viewer poll thing to banish Andy Kaufman from Saturday Night Live.

1135
01:20:01,288 --> 01:20:02,129
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was banished.

1136
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:03,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I remember...

1137
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:35,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna really date myself and make myself super lame here but I don't give a fuck alright do you remember I'm Married With Children they had a night where you could vote on the ending if Al Bundy was going to actually tell Peg he loved her or not like it was a whole I think it was for Valentine's Day and you could actually call in and vote on the ending where if Al Bundy is gonna say I love you Peg or just go to bed without saying it cause the whole episode was about Peg was whining oh Al

1138
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:42,231
[SPEAKER_09]: You never say I love you to me or whatever was the whole plot.

1139
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:43,795
[SPEAKER_09]: God, that was such a great show.

1140
01:20:43,876 --> 01:20:44,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1141
01:20:46,505 --> 01:20:48,086
[SPEAKER_09]: But they had an interactive episode.

1142
01:20:48,146 --> 01:20:48,747
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know.

1143
01:20:49,848 --> 01:20:50,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they?

1144
01:20:51,549 --> 01:20:52,951
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I remember, yes.

1145
01:20:53,111 --> 01:20:54,432
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, I love you at the end of the night.

1146
01:20:54,692 --> 01:20:55,713
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1147
01:20:55,733 --> 01:20:56,714
[SPEAKER_09]: It was all the women voting.

1148
01:20:57,314 --> 01:21:00,036
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway.

1149
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:01,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to give you beer more often.

1150
01:21:02,098 --> 01:21:05,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I said that to get a reaction out of DarkSakura and didn't really get one.

1151
01:21:05,301 --> 01:21:06,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him a look.

1152
01:21:06,702 --> 01:21:08,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I did get side-eye a little bit.

1153
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,264
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't transfer well to radio.

1154
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:10,045
[SPEAKER_09]: You know side-eye like

1155
01:21:12,532 --> 01:21:12,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1156
01:21:13,653 --> 01:21:14,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob gets a snort.

1157
01:21:15,854 --> 01:21:16,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what I was saying.

1158
01:21:16,855 --> 01:21:17,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too busy looking at gay.

1159
01:21:18,216 --> 01:21:22,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I also remember an episode of You Can't Do That on television where you could vote, but that wasn't real.

1160
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:25,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

1161
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really dating myself tonight.

1162
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:29,102
[SPEAKER_02]: That does not compute episode where they used gray slime.

1163
01:21:29,442 --> 01:21:29,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank God.

1164
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:32,404
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says, I remember this.

1165
01:21:32,484 --> 01:21:33,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank God it's not just me.

1166
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:38,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I grew up unmarried with children.

1167
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:38,643
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my show.

1168
01:21:38,723 --> 01:21:39,023
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1169
01:21:39,504 --> 01:21:47,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of blasts from the past, we like to do a segment here on the show where DarkSakura digs through the archives of gaming and finds a game that she says, Hey.

1170
01:21:49,174 --> 01:21:50,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you.

1171
01:21:50,876 --> 01:21:51,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, listen.

1172
01:21:51,817 --> 01:21:52,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Get off my lawn.

1173
01:21:53,098 --> 01:21:54,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Al.

1174
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the gayest game ever.

1175
01:21:57,062 --> 01:21:58,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Dan.

1176
01:22:00,339 --> 01:22:01,919
[SPEAKER_09]: You should play this game.

1177
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:05,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to get him to download it for me and he won't do it out of pure principle.

1178
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:06,821
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody needs to get it for me.

1179
01:22:07,261 --> 01:22:09,902
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1180
01:22:10,182 --> 01:22:11,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Cho Aniki.

1181
01:22:11,962 --> 01:22:15,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, gayest game ever.

1182
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:17,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of sad that I asked, but here you go.

1183
01:22:18,522 --> 01:22:22,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, when I told Rob I was picking it, he replied with LOL Gay.

1184
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:27,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jovani Key, it means Super Big Brother.

1185
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:32,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game series done by Masaya and published by NSC Corp.

1186
01:22:33,526 --> 01:22:39,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out in 1992 for the PC Engine with lots of spin-offs and sequels and other versions.

1187
01:22:40,348 --> 01:22:52,979
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a mostly most versions are side-scrolling shoot-em-up plays kind of like Gradius we did get Cho Aniki on virtual console and somebody needs to give it to me

1188
01:22:54,499 --> 01:22:56,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually still been looking for a huge part of this.

1189
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:59,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have a copy of Cho Aniki.

1190
01:23:00,743 --> 01:23:15,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, to start with the first game, the plot has the heroes, who are these big buff muscle-bound men in speedos, going through different areas, space, ruins, cities, fighting alien invaders.

1191
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:23,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bo Emperor Bill, which is Bo Tebiru, which is supposed to be short of bodybuild.

1192
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:35,926
[SPEAKER_02]: is basically a man who achieved 10 consecutive victories in the Great Galaxy Bodybuilding Contest is facing an ever-decreasing supply of protein.

1193
01:23:36,846 --> 01:23:40,688
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's invading other star systems to establish protein factories.

1194
01:23:41,289 --> 01:23:42,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And so... Wow!

1195
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:49,253
[SPEAKER_02]: The Heaven Realms sent Ida Ten and Ben Ten to take over Bo Emperor Bill.

1196
01:23:49,913 --> 01:23:52,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a sweaty, hot muscle battle.

1197
01:23:53,856 --> 01:23:54,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1198
01:23:56,438 --> 01:24:05,566
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main characters actually in this one was Ita Den was just a pretty guy and Benten who was a girl with blue hair.

1199
01:24:06,387 --> 01:24:11,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the Musclebound Men, Samson and Adon who are the Musclebound Men in Speedos.

1200
01:24:12,332 --> 01:24:15,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And they hover around and they are the brothers.

1201
01:24:16,756 --> 01:24:19,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1202
01:24:20,042 --> 01:24:20,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

1203
01:24:20,703 --> 01:24:26,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the whole genre of games that these are in are what's called, they're very kitschy.

1204
01:24:26,732 --> 01:24:30,959
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called bakage, which is like idiot game.

1205
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,500
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1206
01:24:52,012 --> 01:24:52,973
[SPEAKER_02]: and Fairly Neat.

1207
01:24:53,613 --> 01:24:57,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really pornographic, just gay.

1208
01:24:57,876 --> 01:24:58,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Gay!

1209
01:25:00,617 --> 01:25:04,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rights to the series are now actually owned by Xtreme Co.

1210
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:05,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Ltd.

1211
01:25:05,891 --> 01:25:06,892
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1212
01:25:26,032 --> 01:25:49,073
[SPEAKER_02]: and in this one you fight the you actually have to raise the Neo Builder army um well the the bad guy is a name is uh Bote Kon Shiasu which is body conscious it's a pun to fight Ida-Ten and Ben-Ten and um they uh fall in love in a lope so uh Samson and Adon have to fight and uh it's

1213
01:25:50,919 --> 01:25:53,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it came out on Virtual Console Japan in 2007.

1214
01:25:53,803 --> 01:25:59,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Cho Aniki, Bakuretsu Ranto-hen, which is a different one.

1215
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:00,051
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fighting game.

1216
01:26:00,532 --> 01:26:03,556
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Idaten, Benten, Samson, and Adon.

1217
01:26:03,976 --> 01:26:05,939
[SPEAKER_02]: They attack by gyrating and flatulating.

1218
01:26:05,959 --> 01:26:06,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1219
01:26:07,801 --> 01:26:36,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Sabu, who is a pagoda-shaped ship with Elvis Presley on the top Mami19, who is a cute girl mixed with a battleship transporting three naked, frolicking men Adam, who is actually Adam from The Creation who is half-naked and riding on the moon Bote, who is the guy from the first game and Uminin, who is a latex creature that looks like a condom

1220
01:26:38,971 --> 01:26:46,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Cho Ainiki, Kyuukyoku, Meteki Ginga Saikyo Otoko

1221
01:27:02,108 --> 01:27:05,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it's still weird.

1222
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:10,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's actually available for download on PlayStation Network, uh, in North America.

1223
01:27:11,157 --> 01:27:12,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So, get it, and then send it to me.

1224
01:27:13,179 --> 01:27:18,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have the WonderSwan, uh, version, Cho Aineki Otoko no Tamahuda.

1225
01:27:19,045 --> 01:27:19,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1226
01:27:20,946 --> 01:27:24,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually... I've explained what Hanafuda is before, haven't I?

1227
01:27:25,431 --> 01:27:25,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

1228
01:27:25,912 --> 01:27:27,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo started off as a Hanafuda company.

1229
01:27:27,914 --> 01:27:28,574
[SPEAKER_02]: It's playing cards.

1230
01:27:28,674 --> 01:27:29,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a type of playing card game.

1231
01:27:29,856 --> 01:27:30,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1232
01:27:30,296 --> 01:27:34,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just wanted to... I switched the music to the ending from the PC Engine version because I wanted to see it.

1233
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:35,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1234
01:27:35,481 --> 01:27:35,942
[SPEAKER_09]: So, sorry.

1235
01:27:36,202 --> 01:27:36,542
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1236
01:27:37,223 --> 01:27:42,328
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's actually a portmanteau of Tamashii, which is soul, and Hanafuda, which is a card game.

1237
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:43,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like...

1238
01:27:45,477 --> 01:27:45,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Tama Balls

1239
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:06,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, I was going to say, you know what's funny is that obviously I know of this game because I've been doing this show for a while and how can you not know about this game?

1240
01:28:07,409 --> 01:28:10,390
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've never played it, believe it or not.

1241
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:11,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never played this game.

1242
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:16,792
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like I just kind of look at it with a raised eyebrow going, what?

1243
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:19,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I'm sure is what most people do.

1244
01:28:19,693 --> 01:28:20,613
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's probably the point.

1245
01:28:21,147 --> 01:28:30,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, the last one on my list is Cho Aineke, Senaru Protein Densetsu, which is Legend of the Holy Protein.

1246
01:28:32,293 --> 01:28:35,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's done by the group that did Sengoku Blade.

1247
01:28:35,595 --> 01:28:36,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy Protein Batman.

1248
01:28:37,596 --> 01:28:39,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to read exactly what's on the article.

1249
01:28:39,697 --> 01:28:46,161
[SPEAKER_02]: The plot of the game centers on the holy protein, a deity-like glob of what may be semen.

1250
01:28:47,808 --> 01:28:52,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Samson and Adon hover around the glob, absorbing enemy fire as they did in the previous game.

1251
01:28:53,431 --> 01:28:55,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1252
01:28:56,993 --> 01:28:57,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1253
01:28:57,813 --> 01:29:06,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a Mona Lisa painting that fires lasers from its eyes, and a giant cross-dressing man in a maid outfit.

1254
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:08,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1255
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:12,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was Choaniki Zero, which came out by Extreme Co.

1256
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:12,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Ltd.

1257
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:13,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

1258
01:29:16,222 --> 01:29:24,786
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing with Cho Aineke is that it's so completely freaking nuts that you can't help but love it.

1259
01:29:24,886 --> 01:29:32,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's actually... Masaya made a game called... Well, a series called Langrisser, which I've played a few of those games.

1260
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:36,931
[SPEAKER_02]: But Samson and all of them are in it.

1261
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:39,112
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go to the Muscle Shrine where you fight Samson.

1262
01:29:40,133 --> 01:29:41,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can use the Aineke summon.

1263
01:29:41,774 --> 01:29:41,974
Yeah.

1264
01:29:42,934 --> 01:29:48,378
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, and PlayStation versions, which I've played the Super Nintendo one.

1265
01:29:49,739 --> 01:29:58,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom game God Hand makes fun of Samson and Add-On as powerless yet flamboyant drag queens, who are the first bosses in the game.

1266
01:29:58,825 --> 01:29:59,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1267
01:29:59,526 --> 01:29:59,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1268
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:10,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they, they have, uh, Samson and Adlon have a weapon called Men's Beam, which is white energy from holes in their head.

1269
01:30:10,374 --> 01:30:10,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1270
01:30:11,775 --> 01:30:12,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1271
01:30:12,895 --> 01:30:14,456
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's gay.

1272
01:30:16,076 --> 01:30:20,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I'm saying this, it's gay.

1273
01:30:22,779 --> 01:30:26,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I don't really think it's gay as in homosexual, it's more like gay as in, um, Christmas.

1274
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:27,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Christmas.

1275
01:30:29,286 --> 01:30:41,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's full of penis references and naked men in speedos and drag queens I don't remember playing it maybe I did and I just blocked it from my mind Yeah, I'm not so sure I think I might use the word what

1276
01:31:01,162 --> 01:31:01,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I won it.

1277
01:31:02,843 --> 01:31:03,123
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1278
01:31:04,183 --> 01:31:06,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1279
01:31:06,904 --> 01:31:10,946
[SPEAKER_09]: If DarkSakura's all finished over there, Cho Aniki on various systems.

1280
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:11,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Big Brother.

1281
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:14,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Various systems.

1282
01:31:14,127 --> 01:31:18,829
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, Rob, after I've played, I've played like a couple of them.

1283
01:31:19,329 --> 01:31:20,430
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually really fun.

1284
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:23,371
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so bizarre.

1285
01:31:23,951 --> 01:31:27,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just mean, you can't help but laugh and be happy while you're playing it.

1286
01:31:27,753 --> 01:31:28,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's naked.

1287
01:31:28,613 --> 01:31:29,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then it is gay.

1288
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:30,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Because gay means happy.

1289
01:31:31,918 --> 01:31:34,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't meaning like... I know, I know.

1290
01:31:34,361 --> 01:31:34,981
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean.

1291
01:31:35,121 --> 01:31:35,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you mean.

1292
01:31:35,702 --> 01:31:37,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it was, it's gorgeous.

1293
01:31:37,503 --> 01:31:41,768
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's, it's beautiful.

1294
01:31:43,089 --> 01:31:43,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Penis.

1295
01:31:47,012 --> 01:31:47,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 12.

1296
01:31:47,633 --> 01:31:51,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to need to crop that and add that to the soundboard at some point.

1297
01:31:51,537 --> 01:31:52,738
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, just messing.

1298
01:31:52,967 --> 01:31:54,948
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to take a break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1299
01:31:54,968 --> 01:31:55,588
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be right back.

1300
01:31:55,628 --> 01:32:01,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Your Twitter topics, and God, you saw what came last week and what that became, so who knows what's on the Twitter this week.

1301
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:03,430
[SPEAKER_09]: So get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.

1302
01:32:04,031 --> 01:32:07,032
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to also get to the mailbag, and we're going to talk about some other news stories.

1303
01:32:07,392 --> 01:32:10,553
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about some goings-on in Xbox Live Arcade.

1304
01:32:10,853 --> 01:32:14,034
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about the future of arcade games in another country.

1305
01:32:14,554 --> 01:32:26,702
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're going to talk about a game that is being pirated that's doing something kind of lulzy especially if you're DarkSakura you're going to find this pretty lulzy so we'll be back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1306
01:32:32,441 --> 01:32:37,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has a voice.

1307
01:32:37,964 --> 01:32:46,528
[SPEAKER_09]: We are taping live our 392nd episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 5th, right, of 2010.

1308
01:32:46,909 --> 01:32:47,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I lost track of time.

1309
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:49,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Only 20 shopping days left.

1310
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:51,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, no, not even that many.

1311
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:51,091
19.

1312
01:32:51,711 --> 01:32:52,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

1313
01:32:53,012 --> 01:32:53,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well.

1314
01:32:53,732 --> 01:32:57,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, this is the part of the show where we like to welcome you guys back.

1315
01:33:15,205 --> 01:33:15,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Duke Nukem Forever Earlier

1316
01:33:36,303 --> 01:33:39,124
[SPEAKER_09]: True, but that's also more money.

1317
01:33:39,284 --> 01:33:42,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Like $18 to see if I... Because I don't know if I'm going to like it or not.

1318
01:33:42,105 --> 01:33:42,785
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to love it.

1319
01:33:42,925 --> 01:33:43,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

1320
01:33:43,365 --> 01:33:43,685
[SPEAKER_09]: You think?

1321
01:33:43,705 --> 01:33:44,325
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll see.

1322
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:44,705
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1323
01:33:45,126 --> 01:33:47,526
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I'm also like, well, shit, Cataclysm's coming out this week.

1324
01:33:47,546 --> 01:33:49,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you could borrow my copy.

1325
01:33:49,347 --> 01:33:50,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that idea.

1326
01:33:51,667 --> 01:34:03,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then also there's always the whole like, I could just play it on Alan's computer, but we always get distracted because like, oh, but we really need to run a raid and wow, oh boy, we really need to go out and drink or whatever we're doing.

1327
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:03,611
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1328
01:34:04,784 --> 01:34:09,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, have either of you guys been to the stores and looked at deals before?

1329
01:34:09,884 --> 01:34:12,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't specifically go shopping.

1330
01:34:12,385 --> 01:34:16,106
[SPEAKER_02]: When Marissa was here, we went over to the Art and Fair Mall.

1331
01:34:16,626 --> 01:34:21,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just walked and looked at stuff, and I popped into Forever 21 and looked at jackets.

1332
01:34:22,728 --> 01:34:25,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I like some of the clothes there.

1333
01:34:25,109 --> 01:34:26,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't wear all of it, but I like some of it.

1334
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:29,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a freaking madhouse, though, like the rest of the mall seemed to be?

1335
01:34:29,271 --> 01:34:31,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was kind of crazy, but not so bad.

1336
01:34:31,471 --> 01:34:34,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I went into... You see... Wait, I did buy something.

1337
01:34:34,632 --> 01:34:35,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's not in here.

1338
01:34:35,573 --> 01:34:36,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought this...

1339
01:34:36,553 --> 01:34:37,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how I bounce!

1340
01:35:06,138 --> 01:35:07,742
[SPEAKER_09]: But you were looking at Pyramid Head on your shirt.

1341
01:35:08,163 --> 01:35:08,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Peahitty.

1342
01:35:09,607 --> 01:35:11,852
[SPEAKER_02]: That shirt is special to me.

1343
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:13,608
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1344
01:35:36,906 --> 01:35:40,733
[SPEAKER_09]: All this month we'll be having a special which is our year-end review of comics.

1345
01:35:49,025 --> 01:35:50,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh boy, so now you know what you gotta catch up on.

1346
01:35:50,426 --> 01:35:53,587
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to see how much we are PO'd with Matt Fraction.

1347
01:35:53,868 --> 01:35:55,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, now do you remember the show I do?

1348
01:35:55,749 --> 01:35:56,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I plugged your show, you remember my show?

1349
01:35:57,149 --> 01:36:00,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the one with Dolly Parton and her boobs.

1350
01:36:00,531 --> 01:36:00,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

1351
01:36:01,372 --> 01:36:06,194
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Best Little Horde House in whatever fucking planet that is.

1352
01:36:06,274 --> 01:36:06,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Azeroth, yes.

1353
01:36:06,995 --> 01:36:07,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Azeroth.

1354
01:36:08,686 --> 01:36:10,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.

1355
01:36:10,487 --> 01:36:13,889
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you're cute, you and Extifer.

1356
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:15,090
[SPEAKER_02]: You're adorable.

1357
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:16,391
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a fun show this week, actually.

1358
01:36:16,411 --> 01:36:17,132
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a special guest.

1359
01:36:17,472 --> 01:36:26,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Frat Matt is what I call him online, but Grandpa Warcraft is what we were calling him because he's been playing, and you know Matt, he's been playing Warcraft since Vanilla, so we were calling him Grandpa Warcraft.

1360
01:36:26,758 --> 01:36:27,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good show.

1361
01:36:27,378 --> 01:36:28,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1362
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:29,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I have absolutely no idea what that means.

1363
01:36:30,347 --> 01:36:31,729
[SPEAKER_09]: He's old and he plays Warcraft.

1364
01:36:31,929 --> 01:36:32,429
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it means.

1365
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:37,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, we have a huge show planned.

1366
01:36:37,194 --> 01:36:37,755
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really.

1367
01:36:38,015 --> 01:36:39,016
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just doing the same old show.

1368
01:36:39,056 --> 01:36:40,178
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is Cataclysm.

1369
01:36:40,258 --> 01:36:42,400
[SPEAKER_09]: The third expansion of WoW does come out this week.

1370
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,201
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pretty big deal.

1371
01:36:43,581 --> 01:36:44,843
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to talk a lot about that.

1372
01:36:44,863 --> 01:36:45,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god!

1373
01:36:45,243 --> 01:36:46,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants vs. Zombies!

1374
01:36:46,044 --> 01:36:46,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Cataclysm!

1375
01:36:46,745 --> 01:36:46,805
Ah!

1376
01:36:47,486 --> 01:36:48,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Splooge, splooge, splooge.

1377
01:36:48,787 --> 01:36:49,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1378
01:36:49,328 --> 01:36:53,534
[SPEAKER_09]: The sad thing is it goes live at midnight tomorrow and I gotta go to bed because of work.

1379
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:55,176
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't stay up and play WoW.

1380
01:36:55,436 --> 01:36:59,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Tuesday, I have to go bake cookies because there's this whole cookie party.

1381
01:36:59,902 --> 01:37:01,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there is a cookie party going on at work.

1382
01:37:01,845 --> 01:37:02,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Cookie party!

1383
01:37:02,846 --> 01:37:03,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Cookie party!

1384
01:37:07,865 --> 01:37:08,826
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the show got canceled.

1385
01:37:08,846 --> 01:37:14,088
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the best part of the Sarah Silverman show was Cookie Party with what was the host name?

1386
01:37:14,168 --> 01:37:16,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Miss something on Cookie Party.

1387
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:16,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget it.

1388
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:20,932
[SPEAKER_09]: All the listeners at home are like, I thought this was a video game podcast.

1389
01:37:21,012 --> 01:37:22,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what's going on at all.

1390
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:28,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's do some rapid fire news and remind them that it is a game podcast.

1391
01:37:28,096 --> 01:37:28,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what do you got for us?

1392
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:30,257
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, Twitter, last chance.

1393
01:37:30,297 --> 01:37:32,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR for Twitter topics tonight.

1394
01:37:32,518 --> 01:37:34,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, cool stuff.

1395
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:47,973
[SPEAKER_07]: You may remember that Ghostbusters, a game that came out almost a year and a half ago, there was a few achievements that were unable to be achieved, I guess, because the game was broken.

1396
01:37:48,753 --> 01:38:06,425
[SPEAKER_07]: and well, apparently they have actually just put through Xbox Live certification the update that will fix those and I guess these now four achievements that were unable to be unlocked before are being fixed.

1397
01:38:06,825 --> 01:38:12,369
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool that they're actually still working on patches for games despite the fact that they came out a long time ago.

1398
01:38:13,089 --> 01:38:14,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So, neat.

1399
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:16,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Ghostbusters, Sanctimus Slime, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and PC

1400
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of a top-down action game.

1401
01:38:39,262 --> 01:38:44,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're saying that it's being developed by the Assault Heroes creator, Wanako.

1402
01:38:45,325 --> 01:38:55,249
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a four-player online and local co-op top-down action game that's going to not really have any of the voice actors because those are expensive.

1403
01:38:56,090 --> 01:39:04,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're not really sure if the characters from the movie, obviously, are going to be there or they're going to be replaced by a new team or something like that.

1404
01:39:05,715 --> 01:39:22,738
[SPEAKER_07]: um but yeah it's uh pretty awesome looking actually from some of the screenshots that they had so I'll be coming sometime soon next year uh Gameloft is announcing some new games they actually had some pretty decent ones when they're not ripping off other games um

1405
01:39:24,404 --> 01:39:24,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1406
01:39:24,685 --> 01:39:26,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how I worked that in there.

1407
01:39:28,309 --> 01:39:32,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Nova 2, it's their first person shooter game that's kind of a little bit like Halo.

1408
01:39:33,235 --> 01:39:35,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It's inspired, I guess, if you will.

1409
01:39:35,378 --> 01:39:36,800
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's actually a pretty solid first person.

1410
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:38,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you said they weren't ripping off other games anymore.

1411
01:39:39,603 --> 01:39:41,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadow Guardian, New IP for Gameloft,

1412
01:40:05,147 --> 01:40:25,698
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's kind of similar to like an Uncharted or Tomb Raider game it's more of like an action adventure game so it looks very Uncharted-esque but you know nice to see some sophisticated games coming to iOS despite the fact Gameloft is really hit or miss with some of this stuff but yeah

1413
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:27,561
[SPEAKER_07]: The original IP stuff's not bad.

1414
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:29,805
[SPEAKER_07]: They're Gangstar or whatever.

1415
01:40:30,406 --> 01:40:36,117
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a bad clone of the old PSP or PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto games.

1416
01:40:38,155 --> 01:40:43,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, let's see, Def Jam.

1417
01:40:43,817 --> 01:40:45,118
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of interesting.

1418
01:40:45,218 --> 01:40:49,020
[SPEAKER_07]: In the UK, Def Jam is doing their Rapstar game.

1419
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:54,502
[SPEAKER_07]: They're having a competition that offers the winner a record contract.

1420
01:40:55,162 --> 01:41:00,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they're going to be teaming up, I guess, with Atlantic Records UK.

1421
01:41:01,765 --> 01:41:08,311
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're giving one lucky UK resident a chance to have their very own record.

1422
01:41:09,152 --> 01:41:27,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to be employing the game's freestyle mode and contestants will upload their hottest 40 bars, give or take, and they're going to be judged by the Def Jam Rapstar community because they do have a really big community aspect to the game, actually, despite the fact a lot of people don't.

1423
01:41:28,007 --> 01:41:28,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a chance to get this game.

1424
01:41:28,907 --> 01:41:32,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to get it for just the microphone because I got it for free.

1425
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:33,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually passed.

1426
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:35,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1427
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:36,471
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't a bad game.

1428
01:41:36,551 --> 01:41:40,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't listen to really the – I mean, maybe there's a couple songs in there I know.

1429
01:41:41,093 --> 01:41:41,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1430
01:41:41,393 --> 01:41:45,575
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not the type of game – I can't see myself honestly playing this game.

1431
01:41:45,595 --> 01:41:51,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially – I live by myself and a lot of my gaming is alone, so I just can't see myself sitting there –

1432
01:41:54,933 --> 01:41:57,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Wrapping by myself in my apartment.

1433
01:41:57,076 --> 01:41:58,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's just something kind of sad.

1434
01:42:01,462 --> 01:42:05,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm crying all night tonight because I just watched a sad movie.

1435
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:08,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll play Def Dam Rapstar to make me feel better.

1436
01:42:09,393 --> 01:42:11,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Sip it on gin and juice.

1437
01:42:12,938 --> 01:42:39,815
[SPEAKER_07]: it says the top regional finalists will then have to compete in front of a live audience at the UK HMV locations they're saying 8 mile style and that's going to be in February and of course that means that the winner will be able to have the actual record contract see Loki you should be participating in this that's why you need the game yes

1438
01:42:41,075 --> 01:42:44,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet anything if you were to submit a video, you would be voted as the winner.

1439
01:42:44,177 --> 01:42:48,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe that Sacramento is in the UK.

1440
01:42:49,319 --> 01:42:53,261
[SPEAKER_07]: My basic geography knowledge says that's not correct.

1441
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:54,182
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to fix this.

1442
01:42:54,282 --> 01:42:55,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Does Kidman rap?

1443
01:42:57,883 --> 01:42:58,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Who else is in the UK?

1444
01:43:02,591 --> 01:43:03,893
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Ake Ripper?

1445
01:43:04,194 --> 01:43:06,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We need some Swedish rappers.

1446
01:43:06,418 --> 01:43:07,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get Ake Ripper.

1447
01:43:07,721 --> 01:43:09,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Does Sweden count?

1448
01:43:10,285 --> 01:43:10,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1449
01:43:11,447 --> 01:43:12,269
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to find that out.

1450
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:14,789
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow.

1451
01:43:14,809 --> 01:43:20,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I have some news, but whatever.

1452
01:43:20,491 --> 01:43:22,012
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not as cool as Swedish rap.

1453
01:43:22,652 --> 01:43:29,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Band Reloaded is now available on the iOS systems, meaning the iPhone, the iPod Touch, the iPad.

1454
01:43:29,434 --> 01:43:33,896
[SPEAKER_09]: It's $5 on the phones and phone with no phone and $10 on the iPad.

1455
01:43:34,276 --> 01:43:37,817
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a new expert mode and apparently full vocal support.

1456
01:43:38,198 --> 01:43:41,519
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could actually sit there and sing along with your phone.

1457
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:48,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Also the iPad version now has split screen multiplayer and several different ways to have the action on screen.

1458
01:43:49,004 --> 01:43:51,245
[SPEAKER_09]: You can reorient gameplay if you're a lefty.

1459
01:43:51,345 --> 01:43:51,926
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of cool.

1460
01:43:52,526 --> 01:43:56,909
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently there's a whole drum kit now that you can kind of have so you can kind of beat your iPad.

1461
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:59,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's how it works.

1462
01:44:00,772 --> 01:44:09,881
[SPEAKER_09]: There are quite a few games available when you initially download it, including Kryptonite, Three Doors Down, So What You Want by Beastie Boys, White Wedding by Billy Idol.

1463
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:11,042
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I love that song.

1464
01:44:11,983 --> 01:44:17,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Call Me When You're Sober by Evanescence, The Perfect Drug by Nine Inch Nails, Hella Good by No Doubt.

1465
01:44:17,188 --> 01:44:20,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, a lot of these games are sort of in the rock band game anyway.

1466
01:44:20,891 --> 01:44:23,934
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also tracks that you can download in the music store.

1467
01:44:24,835 --> 01:44:27,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there's some free tracks too in the music store.

1468
01:44:27,236 --> 01:44:30,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, they're like indie bands and stuff, but the Acrobats are in there.

1469
01:44:30,737 --> 01:44:32,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Daylight and Dollar Short, if you like the Acrobats.

1470
01:44:34,618 --> 01:44:38,600
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people around the internets were fans of Splosion Man.

1471
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:40,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that game that was on the indie marketplace?

1472
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:41,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, guess what?

1473
01:44:41,441 --> 01:44:42,621
[SPEAKER_09]: A sequel has been announced.

1474
01:44:43,201 --> 01:44:43,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1475
01:44:43,842 --> 01:44:44,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Splosion Man.

1476
01:44:45,442 --> 01:44:46,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they're doing like the whole Ms.

1477
01:44:46,943 --> 01:44:48,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Pac-Man thing, but seriously.

1478
01:44:48,103 --> 01:44:48,783
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1479
01:45:05,394 --> 01:45:07,775
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a really early announcement, but there it is.

1480
01:45:09,555 --> 01:45:20,378
[SPEAKER_09]: The CCO Josh Baer of Twisted Pixel has said, quote, We could have churned out new levels for Splosion Man, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff.

1481
01:45:20,678 --> 01:45:22,418
[SPEAKER_09]: But we didn't want to just do Splosion Man 2.

1482
01:45:23,038 --> 01:45:24,759
[SPEAKER_09]: It had to be something a little more interesting.

1483
01:45:25,059 --> 01:45:26,819
[SPEAKER_09]: That is why we're making Ms.

1484
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:27,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Splosion Man.

1485
01:45:28,219 --> 01:45:34,121
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually a teaser trailer that's out there and everything, and as you can expect, it pays homage to Ms.

1486
01:45:34,141 --> 01:45:34,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man.

1487
01:45:36,075 --> 01:45:39,557
[SPEAKER_09]: World of Warcraft news, but not the kind that gets me excited.

1488
01:45:39,598 --> 01:45:40,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

1489
01:45:40,798 --> 01:45:45,922
[SPEAKER_09]: World of Warcraft apparently is now streaming and playable on an HTC Desire.

1490
01:45:46,562 --> 01:45:52,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this whole little tech demo that was out there before has now been fully realized, apparently.

1491
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:57,050
[SPEAKER_09]: An HTC Desire smartphone is running World of Warcraft.

1492
01:45:57,070 --> 01:46:01,993
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if it's like a streaming thing or what, but there's actually a demo that's out there on YouTube.

1493
01:46:02,674 --> 01:46:02,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1494
01:46:03,254 --> 01:46:04,015
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1495
01:46:25,819 --> 01:46:27,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a few things.

1496
01:46:28,401 --> 01:46:31,483
[SPEAKER_02]: To start us off with some Kirby.

1497
01:46:31,663 --> 01:46:32,364
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Kirby?

1498
01:46:33,164 --> 01:46:38,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Kirby's Epic Yarn will be out in 2011 for our European friends on February 25th.

1499
01:46:40,109 --> 01:46:41,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to say 25th.

1500
01:46:41,350 --> 01:46:41,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be 25th.

1501
01:46:43,812 --> 01:46:48,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to wait, but it's going to be all cool.

1502
01:46:48,895 --> 01:47:02,164
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to change it into British English, I guess, so that it can be a duvet instead of a comforter and a lift instead of an elevator and a boot instead of the trunk, that type of thing.

1503
01:47:03,324 --> 01:47:28,280
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh new uh characters for Super Street Fighter 4 we have dun dun dun didn't we call it last uh last week Oni Akuma who is like Shin Akuma who is the super evil one and then we have Evil Ryu so that's gonna be super hot because I loved Evil Ryu of course I would love to have Evil Sakura next Dark Sakura

1504
01:47:29,521 --> 01:47:33,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, for Rock Band, more download content.

1505
01:47:33,064 --> 01:47:34,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We get Queen!

1506
01:47:34,225 --> 01:47:35,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, finally, finally.

1507
01:47:37,387 --> 01:47:42,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Rock Band 3 upgraded tracks from Lego Rock Band.

1508
01:47:43,492 --> 01:47:48,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's what's also going to be in the Queen Extravaganza Pack 1.

1509
01:47:49,116 --> 01:48:04,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Hammer to Fall, Keep Yourself Alive, Now I'm Here, Play the Game, Tenement Funster, We Are the Champions, We Will Rock You, and the Queen Rock Band 3 Enhanced Pack, I Want It All, I Want to Break Free, Killer Queen, One Vision, Somebody to Love, and Under Pressure.

1510
01:48:04,773 --> 01:48:33,945
[SPEAKER_09]: which also is David Bowie I'm so buying that enhanced pack so am I the first pack is a lot of really kind of like off-cut tracks which I mean Queen is Queen they're cool they threw two big ones in there to kind of make it feel a little more valuable but I definitely want like all my favorite Queen songs are in that other pack so and for some reason this is weird I never bought the Queen track pack in Rock Band originally like I just somehow missed it or I wasn't playing Rock Band at the time like there's already like 15 Queen songs available in there

1511
01:48:34,805 --> 01:48:39,486
[SPEAKER_09]: and I really need to get SingStar Queen at some point because I'm sure I can find it really cheap now.

1512
01:48:39,886 --> 01:48:42,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like SingStar ABBA is on like every Target clearance rack.

1513
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:45,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Really need to get SingStar Queen.

1514
01:48:45,888 --> 01:48:48,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com there's some comments.

1515
01:48:49,049 --> 01:48:50,549
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt is talking about Ms.

1516
01:48:50,629 --> 01:48:51,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Explosion Man.

1517
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:51,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1518
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:54,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Explosion Man better have her making a sandwich in the end.

1519
01:48:54,831 --> 01:48:55,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1520
01:48:58,391 --> 01:49:02,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Tigerclaw says the third one should be Junior Explosion Man or Baby Explosion Man.

1521
01:49:03,433 --> 01:49:03,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1522
01:49:04,731 --> 01:49:09,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about Explosion Baby Hey let's go to the tweeter

1523
01:49:19,434 --> 01:49:26,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1524
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:31,043
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt is sending us a story courtesy of Travis Donovan.

1525
01:49:31,723 --> 01:49:36,206
[SPEAKER_09]: South Korea is getting ready to set an internet curfew for young teens.

1526
01:49:36,887 --> 01:49:37,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1527
01:49:37,247 --> 01:49:38,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I had not heard about this.

1528
01:49:38,388 --> 01:49:42,611
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, I did not listen to USL last night.

1529
01:49:42,651 --> 01:49:45,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a very... Yeah, on Saturday night.

1530
01:49:45,213 --> 01:49:46,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a very naughty boy.

1531
01:49:46,094 --> 01:49:46,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I was out.

1532
01:49:47,135 --> 01:49:48,376
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently, South Korea...

1533
01:49:49,217 --> 01:49:52,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I notice I'm being linked to a story from Fox News, so take it from me with the greatest song.

1534
01:49:54,597 --> 01:50:02,863
[SPEAKER_09]: South Korea is apparently considering a nationally enforced gaming curfew in an effort to curb internet addiction.

1535
01:50:02,883 --> 01:50:06,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know a lot of times we've had those crazy internet addicts story and they all seem to be out of South Korea.

1536
01:50:08,087 --> 01:50:19,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently it will make it illegal for internet service providers, if this bill is passed, to give online gaming access to users under the age of 16 between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m.

1537
01:50:21,365 --> 01:50:23,787
[SPEAKER_09]: For South Korean students, this will mean no gaming at all.

1538
01:50:24,167 --> 01:50:28,211
[SPEAKER_09]: It's normal to be in school until midnight due to extracurricular activities and studying.

1539
01:50:28,351 --> 01:50:28,751
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1540
01:50:30,313 --> 01:50:30,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1541
01:50:32,535 --> 01:50:33,776
[SPEAKER_02]: That much study is actually pretty normal.

1542
01:50:35,515 --> 01:50:37,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, makes me feel like a lazy asshole.

1543
01:50:37,356 --> 01:50:42,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I was doing every extracurricular activity in high school, I was still home by 7 or 8 o'clock.

1544
01:50:42,738 --> 01:50:43,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Dang.

1545
01:50:43,859 --> 01:50:46,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, interesting.

1546
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,981
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think about this ban?

1547
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:51,622
[SPEAKER_09]: They would never get away with something like that here in the U.S., that's for sure.

1548
01:50:51,642 --> 01:50:53,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the government's responsibility.

1549
01:50:53,423 --> 01:50:54,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the parents' responsibility.

1550
01:50:54,643 --> 01:50:56,424
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not doing their job, then it's...

1551
01:50:57,964 --> 01:50:58,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

1552
01:50:58,624 --> 01:50:59,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, I agree 100%.

1553
01:50:59,365 --> 01:51:02,967
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the government's responsibility, but whatever.

1554
01:51:03,487 --> 01:51:04,928
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, moving on.

1555
01:51:05,808 --> 01:51:08,029
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya on Twitter wants to remind us of this.

1556
01:51:08,089 --> 01:51:10,211
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, this is something I definitely need to plug.

1557
01:51:10,591 --> 01:51:14,513
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll probably be plugging a little more as we hit the deadline here.

1558
01:51:14,913 --> 01:51:42,441
[SPEAKER_09]: but the USL OLR Madness this used to be called March Madness but I guess they moved it for March 2011 is now open for nominations this is something a little more that our buddies at Under Station Live do and they really involve themselves with but we like to support it here at OLR and I know I have already submitted my list now if you don't know what this is it's basically a competition a la March Madness the NCAA competition to choose the greatest game ever

1559
01:51:43,601 --> 01:51:43,701
[SPEAKER_09]: IDK

1560
01:52:06,273 --> 01:52:16,214
[SPEAKER_09]: but you need to submit your top 25 list to uslmadness at gmail.com now the deadline is January 3rd 2011 so you have a little while but don't procrastinate

1561
01:52:17,892 --> 01:52:18,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with Jamie's thoughts on Cho and Ikki

1562
01:52:39,395 --> 01:52:44,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the PS1 and to say that it's weird and or gay is an understatement.

1563
01:52:44,638 --> 01:52:46,179
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like saying water is wet.

1564
01:52:46,779 --> 01:52:50,842
[SPEAKER_09]: First it was a novelty for me, but once the novelty wore off, I forgot about it.

1565
01:52:51,622 --> 01:52:54,324
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you mean gay meaning happy, I'm okay with that.

1566
01:52:55,649 --> 01:52:58,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's full of homoerotic imagery.

1567
01:52:59,471 --> 01:53:02,172
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, it is, but I just, you know, whatever.

1568
01:53:03,252 --> 01:53:05,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know me, I never use the word gay to mean anything bad.

1569
01:53:06,333 --> 01:53:07,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.

1570
01:53:08,214 --> 01:53:09,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, penis.

1571
01:53:11,155 --> 01:53:16,518
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, there's a lot of games like that, though, where once the novelty wars off, it's kind of over.

1572
01:53:16,939 --> 01:53:19,680
[SPEAKER_09]: There's sadly too many games like that out there, but whatever.

1573
01:53:20,221 --> 01:53:22,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, Tigerclaw sends us a variety of tweets.

1574
01:53:23,083 --> 01:53:31,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to remember there's a two-tweet limit, but I'm feeling generous, and I had beer before the show tonight, so I'm going to let him have all three tonight, because I'm kind and generous.

1575
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:37,652
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, the Toronto Police recover half a million dollars in stolen Sony goods.

1576
01:53:39,332 --> 01:53:48,702
[SPEAKER_09]: they are on it up there in Canada a 39 year old man in Toronto was arrested for stealing half a million dollars we're assuming of course that's Canadian I don't know because they call it dollars too

1577
01:53:49,584 --> 01:54:11,480
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 3s, PSPs, and games apparently this was due to tractor trailers that were stolen on November 15th and 16th in Brampton these trailers had about half a million dollars in PS3s, PSPs, and video games that's where all the Sony stuff went in Canada well, the 39 year old was arrested and will be in court on January 10th of 2011

1578
01:54:14,881 --> 01:54:16,181
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw also sends us a link.

1579
01:54:16,261 --> 01:54:20,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Standalone motion sensing game console believes honesty is the best policy.

1580
01:54:21,123 --> 01:54:23,123
[SPEAKER_09]: This is linked to a story on Joystick.

1581
01:54:23,863 --> 01:54:24,863
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this all about?

1582
01:54:24,924 --> 01:54:27,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it's a knockoff of the Nintendo Wii.

1583
01:54:27,984 --> 01:54:30,285
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a system now called the Wireless 60.

1584
01:54:31,785 --> 01:54:34,226
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a description on the back of the box.

1585
01:54:34,626 --> 01:54:34,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha!

1586
01:54:35,302 --> 01:54:35,963
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.

1587
01:54:36,284 --> 01:54:47,204
[SPEAKER_09]: The description on the back of the box says, If you are looking to purchase or own an Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Wii, or equivalent, this product does not compare or compete with these technologies.

1588
01:54:49,773 --> 01:54:52,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's awfully upfront and endearing of you.

1589
01:54:52,114 --> 01:54:52,555
[SPEAKER_09]: That's brutally honest.

1590
01:54:52,575 --> 01:54:53,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1591
01:54:53,395 --> 01:54:54,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for being honest.

1592
01:54:54,816 --> 01:54:56,917
[SPEAKER_09]: But I love that it is in small print on the back.

1593
01:54:57,297 --> 01:54:59,298
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're looking for a Nintendo Wii, but you know what?

1594
01:54:59,318 --> 01:55:01,099
[SPEAKER_09]: This might not be what you wanted.

1595
01:55:01,559 --> 01:55:02,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1596
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:09,584
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you want the golf kit and the ping pong kit, this is the system for you.

1597
01:55:10,864 --> 01:55:11,965
[SPEAKER_09]: How much is one of these?

1598
01:55:12,565 --> 01:55:13,546
[SPEAKER_09]: They're probably cheap.

1599
01:55:14,821 --> 01:55:18,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, some of these games probably are much worse than a bunch of the crap on the Wii, honestly.

1600
01:55:18,565 --> 01:55:21,568
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be selling yourself short a little bit there, Wireless60.

1601
01:55:24,211 --> 01:55:25,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the name, too.

1602
01:55:26,834 --> 01:55:29,557
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just shy of being Wii60.

1603
01:55:29,797 --> 01:55:30,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about it.

1604
01:55:32,443 --> 01:56:00,605
[SPEAKER_09]: and lastly from Tiger Claw in our last tweet tonight at twitter.com slash OLR people really did buy Donkey Kong with bananas do you remember that there was this whole promo with UK gamers and the UK could actually buy the game with bananas yes apparently there were some folks that actually braved the cold weather and 20 people walked away with the game having paid for them in bananas

1605
01:56:02,492 --> 01:56:03,313
[SPEAKER_09]: How many bananas?

1606
01:56:04,253 --> 01:56:05,974
[SPEAKER_09]: It just said a bunch of bananas.

1607
01:56:06,535 --> 01:56:12,079
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't know exactly how many, but it was the first 20 people in line to give a bunch of bananas.

1608
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:14,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a fun promo.

1609
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:17,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the staff's like, what the fuck are we going to do with these bananas?

1610
01:56:17,802 --> 01:56:19,043
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a, eat them!

1611
01:56:21,285 --> 01:56:22,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, bananas are great.

1612
01:56:22,045 --> 01:56:24,527
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a Black Friday-esque type of promotion.

1613
01:56:24,547 --> 01:56:28,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Old Navy gave away Dance Central to the first few people in line, right?

1614
01:56:28,069 --> 01:56:31,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, you know, that's not completely unheard of.

1615
01:56:32,301 --> 01:56:33,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's going to do it for Twitter Topics Night.

1616
01:56:33,782 --> 01:56:35,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1617
01:56:35,744 --> 01:56:37,745
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, back to more gaming news.

1618
01:56:38,006 --> 01:56:38,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1619
01:56:39,198 --> 01:56:40,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1620
01:56:41,559 --> 01:56:50,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So they had kind of an indie launch thing for the Xbox Marketplace.

1621
01:56:50,785 --> 01:56:57,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now there's kind of the Microsoft Game Studios promotion that they're doing for Xbox Marketplace.

1622
01:56:57,689 --> 01:57:03,173
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, they have three games coming out for the Games for the Holidays presented by Microsoft Game Studios.

1623
01:57:03,993 --> 01:57:13,502
[SPEAKER_07]: and, um, these three games would be including World of Keflings, uh, which does have Avatar support in it, Wrath of Skulls, and Ilo Milo.

1624
01:57:14,203 --> 01:57:17,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though Ilo Milo you can get at, you know, now if you know how.

1625
01:57:18,027 --> 01:57:18,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1626
01:57:19,648 --> 01:57:27,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So, each, uh, looks like they're gonna be, um, you know, 800 Microsoft points each, uh, or $10.

1627
01:57:28,937 --> 01:57:33,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, Ilamilo, of course, is on Xbox Live right now.

1628
01:57:33,621 --> 01:57:34,522
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a way to do that.

1629
01:57:34,642 --> 01:57:37,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can wait to the official release, which is January 5th.

1630
01:57:39,127 --> 01:57:41,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then, of course... Now, why would I want to wait?

1631
01:57:42,009 --> 01:57:43,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, who wants to wait?

1632
01:57:44,212 --> 01:57:50,037
[SPEAKER_07]: World of Keflings, that is kind of a puzzle slash racer mashup game.

1633
01:57:50,938 --> 01:57:55,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to be, I'm sorry, the puzzle racer is Rascals.

1634
01:57:56,184 --> 01:57:58,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to be coming out on the 29th.

1635
01:57:59,147 --> 01:58:01,129
[SPEAKER_07]: World of Keflings will be on the 22nd.

1636
01:58:01,589 --> 01:58:02,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, those are each going to be...

1637
01:58:03,591 --> 01:58:04,731
[SPEAKER_07]: 800 Microsoft Points or $10.

1638
01:58:04,892 --> 01:58:10,453
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, if you buy more than one, there's some bonuses that you get with that.

1639
01:58:10,493 --> 01:58:13,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily money back, but some neat stuff anyways.

1640
01:58:13,834 --> 01:58:17,055
[SPEAKER_07]: You get cross unlockables for each game.

1641
01:58:17,355 --> 01:58:25,038
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, in Ilo Milo, you can get an unlockable Keflins or Rascal costume for Ilo or Milo.

1642
01:58:26,018 --> 01:58:27,238
[SPEAKER_07]: by purchasing the other games.

1643
01:58:27,358 --> 01:58:32,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, you can also unlock Elo and Doug as playable characters in Ratskulls.

1644
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:40,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can also unlock Ratskull characters within Elo Milo and World of Keflings by purchasing the full range of games as well.

1645
01:58:43,202 --> 01:58:45,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Even crazier, it says you can get...

1646
01:58:48,483 --> 01:58:51,746
[SPEAKER_07]: and Rascals Early by buying World of Keflings.

1647
01:58:52,106 --> 01:58:57,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Rascals can be bought from within that game a week before it's released on the 29th.

1648
01:58:58,330 --> 01:59:01,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I have to draw a map to follow all that, but fine.

1649
01:59:01,913 --> 01:59:05,135
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically all these games are giving each other the reach around, essentially.

1650
01:59:05,235 --> 01:59:05,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much.

1651
01:59:06,176 --> 01:59:06,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting promotion.

1652
01:59:07,016 --> 01:59:07,757
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the three-way reach around.

1653
01:59:08,017 --> 01:59:09,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of like that idea.

1654
01:59:09,458 --> 01:59:12,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, even though none of these games are things I'm particularly excited about.

1655
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:13,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess you never know, though.

1656
01:59:13,801 --> 01:59:16,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like, I didn't think I'd be excited about Super Meat Boy, and it's pretty awesome.

1657
01:59:17,384 --> 01:59:17,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1658
01:59:19,037 --> 01:59:25,919
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a neat promotion and very different from what the summer one where it's just like, buy X number of games, get points.

1659
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:26,860
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1660
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of like the idea they've got going on here a little better.

1661
01:59:30,461 --> 01:59:32,041
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

1662
01:59:32,301 --> 01:59:34,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the way the games are interacting with each other.

1663
01:59:34,962 --> 01:59:36,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any interest in any of these games, Loki?

1664
01:59:37,963 --> 01:59:39,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Rascals kind of sounds neat.

1665
01:59:40,464 --> 01:59:42,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Ilo Milo looked kind of cool.

1666
01:59:43,585 --> 01:59:45,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I never played Kingdom of Keflin, so...

1667
01:59:48,243 --> 01:59:51,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I never played Kingdom of Keflings either, but apparently it's pretty popular.

1668
01:59:51,237 --> 01:59:53,186
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought it was only popular because of the Avatar thing.

1669
01:59:53,959 --> 02:00:22,850
[SPEAKER_09]: but I don't know alright well moving on to a game I am really looking forward to and I was very disappointed it didn't make this Christmas but whatever it'll come out soon enough when it's ready LittleBigPlanet 2 is on its way pretty soon and there's a beta going on right now now there's an update that happened on the PlayStation blog where the marketing manager at Sony Computer Entertainment America talked through a tutorial how you can record voices in the game and assign them to characters

1670
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:24,331
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1671
02:00:44,565 --> 02:00:45,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa needs to create Uta.

1672
02:01:05,516 --> 02:01:06,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Marissa.

1673
02:01:06,276 --> 02:01:07,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I was able to see her when I was in LA.

1674
02:01:08,037 --> 02:01:09,318
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, that's awesome.

1675
02:01:10,098 --> 02:01:11,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so looking forward to this game.

1676
02:01:11,519 --> 02:01:12,059
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what though?

1677
02:01:12,099 --> 02:01:14,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Creating levels in LittleBigPlanet 1 was hard enough.

1678
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:17,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't imagine how hard it's going to be in version 2.

1679
02:01:18,202 --> 02:01:19,362
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm very excited about this.

1680
02:01:19,982 --> 02:01:20,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you guys are too.

1681
02:01:21,443 --> 02:01:24,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, will you be doing some voice acting for a level in LittleBigPlanet?

1682
02:01:25,045 --> 02:01:26,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I can, I guess.

1683
02:01:27,706 --> 02:01:29,647
[SPEAKER_09]: AlphaCananagram says this is old news.

1684
02:01:29,747 --> 02:01:30,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, it's new to me.

1685
02:01:30,687 --> 02:01:31,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not in the beta.

1686
02:01:31,828 --> 02:01:34,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been following the news as closely as I should.

1687
02:01:35,959 --> 02:01:38,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and Tigerclaw reminds us as well.

1688
02:01:38,681 --> 02:01:40,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought this was on last week's show, but maybe not.

1689
02:01:40,682 --> 02:01:43,783
[SPEAKER_09]: LittleBigPlanet 2 has no 3D support.

1690
02:01:44,123 --> 02:01:46,245
[SPEAKER_09]: There will not be 3D in LittleBigPlanet 2.

1691
02:01:46,765 --> 02:01:48,726
[SPEAKER_09]: And to that I say, thank you.

1692
02:01:49,206 --> 02:01:50,487
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not necessary.

1693
02:01:52,228 --> 02:01:52,588
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1694
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:54,939
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

1695
02:02:17,748 --> 02:02:27,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega is, well, looking to expand back into the arcade market, but not in Japan, not in the US, but in China.

1696
02:02:28,136 --> 02:02:43,246
[SPEAKER_02]: It, as being the second largest economy in the world, China seems like it's going to be a prime market for video games, especially arcade-based games, and so they are actually taking games like OutRun and Virtua Fighter and doing new versions of them in China.

1697
02:02:45,008 --> 02:02:46,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense, but...

1698
02:02:48,138 --> 02:02:49,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really not sure.

1699
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:51,020
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think Rob?

1700
02:02:53,402 --> 02:02:53,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1701
02:02:53,883 --> 02:03:00,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean I don't live in that country so it's hard for me to say what kind of culture it is but...

1702
02:03:03,962 --> 02:03:09,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate that arcades are dying here, but at the same token, when was the last time I went to one?

1703
02:03:09,325 --> 02:03:10,186
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long time.

1704
02:03:10,606 --> 02:03:14,189
[SPEAKER_09]: But the reason why I don't go to them is that there's not a lot of serious arcades here anymore.

1705
02:03:14,909 --> 02:03:23,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think if they're doing it more seriously in Japan and China, which makes sense because the internet cafe culture is much bigger there too than it is here.

1706
02:03:24,036 --> 02:03:26,398
[SPEAKER_09]: There aren't really internet cafes here anymore.

1707
02:03:26,499 --> 02:03:31,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's one or two, especially in the Chinatowns and Koreatowns.

1708
02:03:31,385 --> 02:03:33,507
[SPEAKER_09]: The biggest one I can think of is in Koreatown in LA.

1709
02:03:35,743 --> 02:03:41,187
[SPEAKER_09]: But cyber cafes to us are like Starbucks where you bring your laptop and use the Wi-Fi.

1710
02:03:42,148 --> 02:03:42,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I was like.

1711
02:03:43,068 --> 02:03:45,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many neat cafes, especially in Japan.

1712
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:46,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go to the cat cafes.

1713
02:03:47,712 --> 02:03:56,378
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's to encourage a more social aspect yet still, you know, it offers a service with it.

1714
02:03:56,818 --> 02:03:58,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of those social games were the best though.

1715
02:03:58,679 --> 02:04:04,922
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is kind of a bummer that Xbox Live sort of took that and made it not needing to go to your arcade.

1716
02:04:05,282 --> 02:04:15,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the best example I can think of is when Soul Calibur 2 was in the arcades and it had that mode where you had your own fighter and the arcade machine would start to kind of memorize how you play.

1717
02:04:15,587 --> 02:04:19,049
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you could fight other people to take over the kingdom.

1718
02:04:19,089 --> 02:04:20,249
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember that whole little mode?

1719
02:04:20,269 --> 02:04:20,690
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.

1720
02:04:20,710 --> 02:04:21,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Conquest mode.

1721
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:22,511
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1722
02:04:40,523 --> 02:05:08,181
[SPEAKER_09]: or um remember when I used Kilik something uh near and dear to our hearts remember when DDR Max 2 was in the arcades and had the community unlocks where the more you played the faster you'd be able to unlock stuff that was always kind of neat I think so and we would keep being and figuring out uh which one was next and how the pattern was working and how many points and I remember we would be there for some of the unlocks it was like oh my god we got an unlock we'd take pictures and stuff it's Santa Marita yeah

1723
02:05:10,697 --> 02:05:12,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Max 300, what's this crap?

1724
02:05:13,339 --> 02:05:13,979
[SPEAKER_09]: The hell is this?

1725
02:05:14,660 --> 02:05:16,101
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I think it's cool.

1726
02:05:16,241 --> 02:05:24,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope maybe some of the ideas used in China and Japan, they can figure out how to make them work in the U.S., but I'm not going to hold my breath because I think the U.S.

1727
02:05:24,767 --> 02:05:28,490
[SPEAKER_09]: is just a bunch of gambling for kids and these ticket-spinning machines.

1728
02:05:29,470 --> 02:05:31,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, Loki, do you have better news for us?

1729
02:05:32,794 --> 02:05:35,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Ticket Spitting Machines The We Speak Microphone

1730
02:06:01,363 --> 02:06:12,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I came out with Animal Crossing, City Folk, and they're like, oh yeah, you can chat with other people, and hey, that's awesome technology to be able to chat with other players when you're playing games.

1731
02:06:12,167 --> 02:06:17,830
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, something that's standard with, say, the Xbox and PlayStation 3, which is why we need to get rid of it.

1732
02:06:18,990 --> 02:06:20,331
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sadly what's happening.

1733
02:06:20,371 --> 02:06:24,653
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii Speak peripheral is now limited at retail locations.

1734
02:06:25,613 --> 02:06:32,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Additional shipments can be made if consumer demand increases, according to Nintendo.

1735
02:06:33,037 --> 02:06:38,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, they are no longer producing those for retail.

1736
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:42,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to say that games won't still support it, but...

1737
02:06:43,049 --> 02:06:43,650
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of sad.

1738
02:06:44,290 --> 02:06:49,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially since they don't really have any sort of headset options or anything like that for the Wii.

1739
02:06:51,799 --> 02:06:52,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1740
02:06:55,091 --> 02:07:00,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, the Wii's kind of had to catch up in some ways, even though Reggie doesn't want you to think that.

1741
02:07:00,072 --> 02:07:08,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, in some ways, they had to really catch up to some of the technology at the 360 and the PS3 was doing, but it didn't work in this case.

1742
02:07:08,174 --> 02:07:12,895
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think part of it was that they'll throw out these peripherals, and Nintendo's done this a few times.

1743
02:07:12,916 --> 02:07:15,876
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll throw out these peripherals and then not really support them.

1744
02:07:16,396 --> 02:07:19,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, there's one or two games that support it, and then that's it.

1745
02:07:19,657 --> 02:07:22,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the balance board, in some ways, is a bit of an anomaly.

1746
02:07:23,078 --> 02:07:31,421
[SPEAKER_09]: If it didn't have this damn good A-plus game behind it, I think the balance board would be added to the list of stuff like Wii Speak.

1747
02:07:31,801 --> 02:07:33,182
[SPEAKER_09]: But Wii Speak was for what?

1748
02:07:33,282 --> 02:07:40,505
[SPEAKER_09]: A game on the Wii that honestly, and I hate to say this, wasn't very good because we'd seen it before.

1749
02:07:40,845 --> 02:07:44,706
[SPEAKER_09]: If there hadn't been two other Animal Crossing games already, then the Wii version would have been awesome.

1750
02:07:45,146 --> 02:07:46,927
[SPEAKER_09]: But that wasn't the case.

1751
02:07:48,568 --> 02:07:50,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what else used Wii Speak?

1752
02:07:50,248 --> 02:07:50,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing.

1753
02:07:51,349 --> 02:07:51,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing.

1754
02:07:52,709 --> 02:08:02,238
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and it's not like the Wii is known for its online gaming capabilities, where Wii Speak would come into play, so it was kind of useless.

1755
02:08:03,899 --> 02:08:04,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1756
02:08:05,822 --> 02:08:06,502
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unfortunate.

1757
02:08:08,223 --> 02:08:10,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1758
02:08:11,966 --> 02:08:13,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say this name again and butcher it.

1759
02:08:13,627 --> 02:08:14,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1760
02:08:14,907 --> 02:08:18,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Maginomicon says, yeah, that was a total waste of my money.

1761
02:08:18,710 --> 02:08:22,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be fair, there wasn't a better offer on the PS2, a better showing.

1762
02:08:23,192 --> 02:08:24,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's one way to look at it.

1763
02:08:25,454 --> 02:08:29,316
[SPEAKER_09]: And then AlphaCanadagram in our chatroom says, seriously, why isn't the WeSpeak hacked already for the PC?

1764
02:08:31,084 --> 02:08:31,824
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good question.

1765
02:08:32,164 --> 02:08:32,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe nobody cared.

1766
02:08:33,964 --> 02:08:36,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you could just plug a microphone into the PC and there you go.

1767
02:08:38,625 --> 02:08:39,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1768
02:08:39,625 --> 02:08:44,926
[SPEAKER_09]: And Maginomicon also says, what about the broadband adapter for the GameCube?

1769
02:08:45,006 --> 02:08:45,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

1770
02:08:45,766 --> 02:08:48,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about a peripheral that really went wrong.

1771
02:08:49,167 --> 02:08:51,227
[SPEAKER_09]: That could have been an awesome must-have peripheral.

1772
02:08:51,267 --> 02:08:53,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Phantasy Star game on GameCube was actually really awesome, too.

1773
02:08:53,668 --> 02:08:54,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was.

1774
02:08:54,148 --> 02:08:55,488
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Phantasy Star Online.

1775
02:08:55,908 --> 02:09:00,469
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a bummer that Sega made it because Nintendo just didn't care.

1776
02:09:01,539 --> 02:09:01,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1777
02:09:04,401 --> 02:09:05,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo hates Sega, confirmed.

1778
02:09:06,482 --> 02:09:06,803
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1779
02:09:08,163 --> 02:09:13,147
[SPEAKER_09]: One other story I have for you guys before we get to the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1780
02:09:13,187 --> 02:09:15,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Majinamacon says I pronounced his name right.

1781
02:09:16,049 --> 02:09:19,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

1782
02:09:19,871 --> 02:09:21,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

1783
02:09:21,052 --> 02:09:22,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I feel like I should play the level up music.

1784
02:09:23,353 --> 02:09:23,714
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1785
02:09:23,734 --> 02:09:24,955
[SPEAKER_09]: You all right over there?

1786
02:09:29,156 --> 02:09:31,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I was singing a little music for you.

1787
02:09:50,509 --> 02:09:59,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Apple made an update to the Terms of Service on Game Center this week saying that they will now use your real name when you send a friend request or reply.

1788
02:09:59,951 --> 02:10:03,692
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're going to add someone on Game Center, you better be prepared for them to see your real name.

1789
02:10:04,172 --> 02:10:10,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the rest of Game Center will not show the name, and if you already have people friended on Game Center, they're not going to be able to see your name.

1790
02:10:10,854 --> 02:10:13,955
[SPEAKER_09]: They will see your user handle, and that's it.

1791
02:10:15,135 --> 02:10:20,938
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, the Terms of Service also say that users must not pretend to be anyone or any entity they are not.

1792
02:10:22,299 --> 02:10:26,481
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is not hitting that same kind of pushback that Real ID did.

1793
02:10:26,901 --> 02:10:35,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing, though, and I think a point that the game blogs are missing is that there were two big problems with Real ID that I don't see as a problem in Game Center.

1794
02:10:35,425 --> 02:10:40,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, Blizzard was threatening to put real names on their forums.

1795
02:10:41,108 --> 02:11:07,231
[SPEAKER_09]: and fine don't post in the forums except for the fact that Blizzard will direct you to their forums to report bugs and things so it was a little bit of a catch-22 whereas we want you to use our forums but we're going to out your real name as a part of that and not to get into the rant I got into several weeks ago on this show when that was the news but let's just put this quickly if you think it's not a big deal to have your first and last name out there fine but keep in mind

1796
02:11:07,731 --> 02:11:08,211
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com.

1797
02:11:31,861 --> 02:11:32,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like it being out there.

1798
02:11:56,825 --> 02:12:11,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I sort of think I know what they were trying to do with that, but as somebody, again, who has stalked before because somebody used a friend of mine to get to me, I can see where this is a potential for problem, and it made me very mad about Real ID.

1799
02:12:12,179 --> 02:12:18,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Now Blizzard got rid of it, they finally pulled their head out of their butt and they decided not to do this on the forum and they turned off the friend of friend.

1800
02:12:19,045 --> 02:12:29,554
[SPEAKER_09]: They still have the real names in the game and if you add somebody to your friends list they see your real name and so forth but at this point I'm kind of like okay well I don't add people to my friends list I don't really know so it's really not a big deal.

1801
02:12:30,675 --> 02:12:57,047
[SPEAKER_09]: um and that's kind of where Game Center's at and so I don't think it's the same thing that Blizzard's doing because now Game Center is doing what Real ID is now and nothing more and I think a big part of the reason why they're doing it is that there were the spammers out there people were posting on their Twitter you know add me on Game Center friends and then they got all these spammers I don't really know how you spam people on Game Center but whatever it was out there it was a problem so I think this is how Apple's trying to fix the problem

1802
02:12:58,027 --> 02:13:06,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Something else to throw out there is that when I used Ping, wow to that tank, but I was on Ping for like a day.

1803
02:13:06,755 --> 02:13:09,398
[SPEAKER_09]: When I signed up for Ping, I was able to use an alias.

1804
02:13:10,298 --> 02:13:13,341
[SPEAKER_09]: If you search for Rob Roberts on Ping, you'll find me, my radio name.

1805
02:13:14,202 --> 02:13:19,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that's the name that's being used on Game Center, then I really don't have a problem with it.

1806
02:13:19,367 --> 02:13:19,867
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

1807
02:13:20,868 --> 02:13:34,984
[SPEAKER_09]: but I don't know like I'm too I don't really know anybody else to send a friend request to because at the end of the day Game Center there is zero point to it what does Game Center bring to the iPhone gaming experience not a damn thing achievements and scoreboards

1808
02:13:35,825 --> 02:13:52,297
[SPEAKER_09]: whoopty shit especially for a lot of games that you could write off very easily these are not serious games whereas World of Warcraft that's a huge time thing for a lot of people and a very passionate experience whereas I don't think people get that connected to their iPhone games

1809
02:13:53,238 --> 02:13:55,159
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's like LOL, Pocket Frogs.

1810
02:13:55,419 --> 02:13:57,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my Peggle, you hush!

1811
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:00,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't really play a lot of Game Center games.

1812
02:14:00,602 --> 02:14:05,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Mainly, it's just Open Feint stuff, because there's a lot more games that I play that have Open Feint in them.

1813
02:14:05,784 --> 02:14:08,646
[SPEAKER_07]: More of them are getting Game Center, but I don't really care.

1814
02:14:08,946 --> 02:14:12,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have one game on Game Center, and all the rest of mine are Open Feint.

1815
02:14:13,608 --> 02:14:13,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1816
02:14:16,604 --> 02:14:22,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Game Center is... I don't think it's the same thing as Real ID.

1817
02:14:22,466 --> 02:14:27,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Because at the end of the day, WoW has a lot of passion behind it.

1818
02:14:27,828 --> 02:14:30,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Game Center has a lot of... I don't care.

1819
02:14:30,809 --> 02:14:32,290
[SPEAKER_09]: No one care behind it.

1820
02:14:34,255 --> 02:14:53,457
[SPEAKER_09]: if I had to delete Game Center at the end of the day I wouldn't cry but if I had to delete World of Warcraft I'd be very upset that Blizzard made such a dumb decision because you know I am you know call me an addict or whatever you want I am very invested in that game because it is a way for me to kind of play games online with my friends so there you go

1821
02:14:54,659 --> 02:14:55,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the mailbag.

1822
02:14:55,619 --> 02:15:01,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Every week you guys send us emails and we read them.

1823
02:15:02,561 --> 02:15:07,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the mailbag's been kind of light the last few weeks, but as I understand, the listeners have really pulled through this week, haven't they?

1824
02:15:07,742 --> 02:15:09,763
[SPEAKER_02]: They did, and I've actually cut out the really long ones.

1825
02:15:10,903 --> 02:15:11,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww.

1826
02:15:11,023 --> 02:15:12,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to post them online or anything?

1827
02:15:12,643 --> 02:15:13,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I might post them on the forum.

1828
02:15:14,164 --> 02:15:15,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I said there's one I would post on the forum.

1829
02:15:15,864 --> 02:15:16,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1830
02:15:16,944 --> 02:15:19,125
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to do that when I remember to.

1831
02:15:19,665 --> 02:15:21,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, first email.

1832
02:15:21,786 --> 02:15:23,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, by the lady that sent us boobs.

1833
02:15:24,287 --> 02:15:24,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamer girl.

1834
02:15:24,847 --> 02:15:25,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what, what?

1835
02:15:25,568 --> 02:15:25,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Boobs?

1836
02:15:26,068 --> 02:15:26,228
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1837
02:15:26,408 --> 02:15:26,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Boobs?

1838
02:15:26,528 --> 02:15:29,889
[SPEAKER_02]: She sent a picture of her chest and she's wearing an Eggo t-shirt and quite lovely.

1839
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:31,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Lego my Eggo.

1840
02:15:32,511 --> 02:15:36,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Says, I just wanted to write the show and say you guys do an awesome job.

1841
02:15:37,053 --> 02:15:39,714
[SPEAKER_02]: If you keep me, no, you keep me laughing and I love it.

1842
02:15:40,214 --> 02:15:44,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to know if anyone is excited about the new Cataclysm experience.

1843
02:15:45,136 --> 02:15:46,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's just hype?

1844
02:15:46,457 --> 02:15:47,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey.

1845
02:15:49,252 --> 02:15:50,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed part of that, what was that?

1846
02:15:52,155 --> 02:16:08,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, I've been a fan of World of Warcraft Warcraft is a hole for a good while now After all, it's my crack, aka way out of the real world for a while Anyway, just wanted to say, again, good job with the show, Sincerely, Gamer Girl

1847
02:16:09,184 --> 02:16:09,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1848
02:16:27,447 --> 02:16:29,809
[SPEAKER_09]: It was now five years, six years old.

1849
02:16:30,189 --> 02:16:32,631
[SPEAKER_09]: That's as long as a lot of game consoles last.

1850
02:16:32,671 --> 02:16:36,394
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I realize now in this generation we're in, it's a little bit different.

1851
02:16:36,454 --> 02:16:37,815
[SPEAKER_09]: But even now, we're what?

1852
02:16:37,975 --> 02:16:39,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Five years since the Xbox 360 launched?

1853
02:16:40,477 --> 02:16:44,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, we could use a cataclysm in Final Fantasy XI.

1854
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:49,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted, they had Dynamis, the uber elite, hard...

1855
02:16:50,945 --> 02:16:51,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Cataclysm.

1856
02:16:51,565 --> 02:16:56,607
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the point I'm really trying to make, is that the Xbox 360 has been out for, what, five, six years now?

1857
02:16:57,047 --> 02:16:57,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And what are they doing now?

1858
02:16:57,988 --> 02:17:01,049
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't release a new console because of economy and so forth, but what are they doing?

1859
02:17:01,069 --> 02:17:01,849
[SPEAKER_09]: They're releasing Kinect.

1860
02:17:02,089 --> 02:17:03,810
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to reinvent the old experience.

1861
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:08,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you suggesting that the Red Rings of Death were the cataclysm of the Xbox?

1862
02:17:09,312 --> 02:17:09,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1863
02:17:10,072 --> 02:17:17,676
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you have the Cataclysm coming to World of Warcraft as a way to kind of reinvent the game and make old stuff new again.

1864
02:17:17,956 --> 02:17:20,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And so for that reason, yeah, I think it is kind of a big deal.

1865
02:17:20,517 --> 02:17:24,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if you are passionate... I mean, you already know right now if you're buying Cataclysm or not.

1866
02:17:24,518 --> 02:17:26,199
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Goblin Rockets are pretty awesome.

1867
02:17:26,319 --> 02:17:26,559
[SPEAKER_09]: They are.

1868
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:28,540
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's see.

1869
02:17:29,060 --> 02:17:31,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to make a long story short, and it's not really working very well.

1870
02:17:31,621 --> 02:17:32,542
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will say this.

1871
02:17:33,402 --> 02:17:48,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Cataclysm World of Warcraft was a great way for them to get World of Warcraft 2 without making it a whole new game and splitting the player base like what happened with EverQuest and Final Fantasy in some regards World of Warcraft Cataclysm is WoW 2

1872
02:17:49,545 --> 02:18:06,069
[SPEAKER_09]: it might not be as jarring of a change but they went back and redid a lot of old shit and made it prettier and just short of the character models which I'm sure will be in the next expansion it's neat that Blizzard does innovate a little bit with each expansion it's pretty cool so I think it's a big deal

1873
02:18:07,116 --> 02:18:10,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm done.

1874
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:13,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear that EverQuest 2 may be doing the same thing?

1875
02:18:13,905 --> 02:18:14,806
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean the same thing?

1876
02:18:14,906 --> 02:18:17,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a cataclysm type thing?

1877
02:18:18,631 --> 02:18:19,833
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the point behind it?

1878
02:18:19,873 --> 02:18:21,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Just trying to get people to play.

1879
02:18:22,816 --> 02:18:24,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Rap's butt, and he's talking about games!

1880
02:18:48,394 --> 02:18:52,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, my point is, they made a mistake splitting the player base.

1881
02:18:52,543 --> 02:18:53,866
[SPEAKER_09]: But everybody got to learn from that.

1882
02:18:55,570 --> 02:18:56,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1883
02:18:56,893 --> 02:18:58,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, this makes my heart feel warm.

1884
02:19:00,444 --> 02:19:01,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, Jamie, and Loki.

1885
02:19:02,346 --> 02:19:03,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say thank you.

1886
02:19:04,408 --> 02:19:10,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a couple of back episodes to listen to at work helped me get through what has been the worst week I've had.

1887
02:19:11,235 --> 02:19:18,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Listening to friends I've never met talk about and have fun doing something that they and I enjoy was a much needed bright spot and distraction from everything.

1888
02:19:19,303 --> 02:19:20,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all that you guys do.

1889
02:19:20,924 --> 02:19:21,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad.

1890
02:19:21,705 --> 02:19:23,327
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our Brad from PodCulture.

1891
02:19:23,767 --> 02:19:24,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Brad.

1892
02:19:25,008 --> 02:19:25,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

1893
02:19:25,768 --> 02:19:28,630
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a really nice message on our Facebook this week, too.

1894
02:19:28,710 --> 02:19:30,752
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a week of warm fuzzies.

1895
02:19:30,892 --> 02:19:31,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

1896
02:19:31,832 --> 02:19:32,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Must be the holidays.

1897
02:19:34,586 --> 02:19:35,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Next one.

1898
02:19:35,547 --> 02:19:36,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, it's MoltenBrown.

1899
02:19:36,908 --> 02:19:38,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to ask you for advice.

1900
02:19:39,269 --> 02:19:43,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have a Nintendo DS and I've been debating whether or not to get a PSP for a long time.

1901
02:19:43,552 --> 02:19:49,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of me wants it for the way the system looks as well as better graphics the system offers compared to the DS.

1902
02:19:49,836 --> 02:19:54,359
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if it's worth the price to pay if there aren't that many games that I will like on it.

1903
02:19:55,260 --> 02:20:00,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like RPGs, fighting games, and games that offer a different visual or playing style than the norm, like Hotel Dusk.

1904
02:20:01,364 --> 02:20:01,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Patapon?

1905
02:20:22,964 --> 02:20:23,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Patapon's cute.

1906
02:20:23,885 --> 02:20:24,505
[SPEAKER_02]: LocoRoco?

1907
02:20:25,026 --> 02:20:26,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, those are all cute games.

1908
02:20:26,287 --> 02:20:30,991
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like RPGs and fighting games, you need that Square Enix game.

1909
02:20:31,231 --> 02:20:33,353
[SPEAKER_09]: The fighting one that's Final Fantasy.

1910
02:20:33,373 --> 02:20:34,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Dissida.

1911
02:20:34,133 --> 02:20:35,454
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be number one on your list.

1912
02:20:35,935 --> 02:20:39,798
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you like a standard fighting game, the Tekken games on PSP are pretty nice.

1913
02:20:41,099 --> 02:20:43,421
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a Soul Calibur game out there, I believe, too.

1914
02:20:43,922 --> 02:20:47,184
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also, as far as RPGs, Puppet Lacrosse was cool.

1915
02:20:47,645 --> 02:20:48,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.

1916
02:20:48,245 --> 02:20:48,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I played through it.

1917
02:20:50,848 --> 02:20:55,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy Remakes Final Fantasy Remakes Final Fantasy Remakes Final Fantasy Remakes

1918
02:21:06,275 --> 02:21:27,641
[SPEAKER_02]: but as for hand comfort given that I have hand problems after my surgery the PSP really is fairly comfortable just because of the curved ends on it but still reaching around for those buttons and I have these little short thumbs it's really about the same in my opinion don't you think Rob?

1919
02:21:28,642 --> 02:21:29,462
[SPEAKER_02]: it's about the same feel?

1920
02:21:29,878 --> 02:21:30,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I missed.

1921
02:21:30,939 --> 02:21:33,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Comfort of the console itself.

1922
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:37,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the PSP or the DS is more comfortable?

1923
02:21:37,922 --> 02:21:38,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are they about the same?

1924
02:21:40,763 --> 02:21:46,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the feel of the PSP because it feels like I'm holding a controller that has a video on it.

1925
02:21:46,766 --> 02:21:50,608
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, I have kind of, you know, I'm six foot two, so I have kind of big hands.

1926
02:21:51,028 --> 02:21:51,709
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

1927
02:21:52,049 --> 02:21:53,450
[SPEAKER_09]: The PSP is not really a problem for me.

1928
02:21:53,810 --> 02:21:59,273
[SPEAKER_09]: The DS, it doesn't feel the same to me because you're using one hand to kind of write.

1929
02:21:59,613 --> 02:22:03,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I actually, to be honest, I like the way the PSP feels a little better, I think.

1930
02:22:04,656 --> 02:22:07,538
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I don't like DS games that overuse the stylus.

1931
02:22:07,638 --> 02:22:08,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while is okay.

1932
02:22:09,139 --> 02:22:14,743
[SPEAKER_09]: But if I'm playing a DS game that now is stylus-free and uses the controller, then it's cool.

1933
02:22:16,564 --> 02:22:17,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm cool with it.

1934
02:22:18,045 --> 02:22:20,046
[SPEAKER_09]: But the square feeling is a little weird.

1935
02:22:21,187 --> 02:22:23,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I actually like the PSP better overall, I gotta admit.

1936
02:22:24,354 --> 02:22:27,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just a few more because we really did get a lot of email.

1937
02:22:27,721 --> 02:22:28,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, OLR.

1938
02:22:28,843 --> 02:22:30,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Another word from Belgium here.

1939
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:34,061
[SPEAKER_02]: My girlfriend brought Kinect for my birthday last week.

1940
02:22:34,141 --> 02:22:35,743
[SPEAKER_02]: What an amazing piece of technology.

1941
02:22:36,163 --> 02:22:38,745
[SPEAKER_02]: For the first time ever in six years, my girlfriend enjoys gaming.

1942
02:22:39,085 --> 02:22:43,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she played other games, but found them too complicated because of all the buttons you need to use.

1943
02:22:43,528 --> 02:22:45,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Now she even asks to game.

1944
02:22:45,489 --> 02:22:46,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Truly, this must be heaven.

1945
02:22:46,930 --> 02:22:49,332
[SPEAKER_02]: She tested Wii and Move 2, but was not very interested in it.

1946
02:22:49,692 --> 02:22:53,515
[SPEAKER_02]: She thinks both are too limited to control different genres of game.

1947
02:22:54,715 --> 02:22:57,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, even my father played Bowling and Connect and he didn't suck at it.

1948
02:22:58,538 --> 02:23:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, as I stated, Connect is amazing.

1949
02:23:00,459 --> 02:23:02,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything Microsoft promised works perfectly.

1950
02:23:03,241 --> 02:23:05,463
[SPEAKER_02]: The major drawback is the space it needs, though.

1951
02:23:05,483 --> 02:23:10,606
[SPEAKER_02]: My room is too small to decently play Connect, so I have to move my 360 and connect to the living room.

1952
02:23:11,026 --> 02:23:13,108
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not my biggest problem.

1953
02:23:13,628 --> 02:23:15,409
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was thinking of is this.

1954
02:23:15,849 --> 02:23:20,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I fear Microsoft might reveal a Connect 2 or Connect HD next to E3.

1955
02:23:21,033 --> 02:23:23,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not need as much space as Connect needs.

1956
02:23:24,896 --> 02:23:26,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft will announce this early.

1957
02:23:26,918 --> 02:23:29,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to shell out another 150 euros next Christmas?

1958
02:23:30,282 --> 02:23:33,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Or will they do no such thing and hold on to the spacious Kinect?

1959
02:23:34,186 --> 02:23:37,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the space needed can be fixed with a firmware update.

1960
02:23:37,930 --> 02:23:39,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to thank you for OLR.

1961
02:23:39,231 --> 02:23:40,312
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys really make my day.

1962
02:23:40,432 --> 02:23:41,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours truly, Fabrice.

1963
02:23:42,071 --> 02:23:45,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, you know, I think the third party company is going to come out with a solution to this.

1964
02:23:46,174 --> 02:23:48,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's actually a lot simpler than it sounds.

1965
02:23:50,157 --> 02:23:56,041
[SPEAKER_07]: But literally snapping on a lens to the front of that would probably fix that right there.

1966
02:23:56,381 --> 02:23:56,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1967
02:23:56,721 --> 02:23:59,964
[SPEAKER_09]: And I your other question about will they announce something new at E3?

1968
02:24:00,384 --> 02:24:01,064
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no way.

1969
02:24:01,204 --> 02:24:01,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Not this soon.

1970
02:24:02,045 --> 02:24:02,866
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1971
02:24:24,344 --> 02:24:28,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see them at all doing a Kinect 2.0.

1972
02:24:54,287 --> 02:25:17,698
[SPEAKER_09]: if Kinect proves popular which so far it is I would expect that when we get to the Xbox 720 or whatever we call it Kinect will be built in to whatever it is they have planned next but that whole whatever's next is still a good two years out at least at least it might come a little it's going to come a lot sooner from Nintendo than it is the other two

1973
02:25:19,862 --> 02:25:23,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony has said time and time again, 10-year cycle, 10-year cycle, 10-year cycle.

1974
02:25:23,884 --> 02:25:26,004
[SPEAKER_09]: The only one that needs to catch up right now is Nintendo.

1975
02:25:26,705 --> 02:25:32,447
[SPEAKER_09]: And in some ways, they don't because they're still selling like crazy because they're kind of the budget system at this point.

1976
02:25:32,807 --> 02:25:37,309
[SPEAKER_07]: But I see them going more of the route like they do with the DS and the Game Boys and all that stuff where it's...

1977
02:25:38,209 --> 02:25:41,750
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that it's an upgrade but it still plays all the old stuff.

1978
02:25:41,970 --> 02:25:48,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I absolutely 100% think whatever we see next from Nintendo is going to be Wii Evolved.

1979
02:25:48,792 --> 02:25:51,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Not throwing out the whole Wii concept altogether.

1980
02:25:51,373 --> 02:25:52,293
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii's been a huge seller.

1981
02:25:52,554 --> 02:25:53,334
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be Wii HD.

1982
02:25:53,374 --> 02:25:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be Weevolved.

1983
02:25:55,094 --> 02:25:55,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Weevolved.

1984
02:25:56,855 --> 02:25:58,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, that'll be the name of the console right there.

1985
02:25:58,295 --> 02:26:06,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Trademark Dark Sakura Origins Radio 2010 blah blah blah restricted.com boobs

1986
02:26:07,919 --> 02:26:13,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, next, uh, and I'm only gonna do two more, we really did get a lot.

1987
02:26:13,584 --> 02:26:14,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, greetings, Orange Knowledge Radio.

1988
02:26:14,825 --> 02:26:19,670
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing, I believe you're all mega excited to see Tron Legacy in about two weeks.

1989
02:26:20,191 --> 02:26:24,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been seeing this ad on Facebook, and well, let me pull up the ad, uh,

1990
02:26:30,441 --> 02:26:32,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big Flash U-Tron legacy thing.

1991
02:26:32,482 --> 02:26:35,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that looks like it's going to load the old arcade game or something.

1992
02:26:35,084 --> 02:26:35,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Flash.

1993
02:26:36,104 --> 02:26:36,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see.

1994
02:26:37,665 --> 02:26:39,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Light Cycles!

1995
02:26:39,666 --> 02:26:43,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet that's like a Light Cycle arcade game on Facebook or something, huh?

1996
02:26:43,188 --> 02:26:44,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Upload your face.

1997
02:26:44,309 --> 02:26:45,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on the grid.

1998
02:26:45,149 --> 02:26:48,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you can take a picture of your face and put it in this trailer.

1999
02:26:49,112 --> 02:26:49,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's cute.

2000
02:26:50,872 --> 02:26:55,215
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like those dancing elves that I see around work every year.

2001
02:26:56,147 --> 02:26:57,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate the freaking dancing elves.

2002
02:26:57,368 --> 02:26:58,810
[SPEAKER_09]: The jib jab, that's what it's called.

2003
02:26:59,410 --> 02:27:01,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to post this in the chat room.

2004
02:27:02,633 --> 02:27:05,836
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a face mapping app.

2005
02:27:06,297 --> 02:27:08,659
[SPEAKER_02]: If you click on it, you may have to take a picture of your face.

2006
02:27:08,959 --> 02:27:11,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Note I said face because it didn't recognize anything else.

2007
02:27:12,423 --> 02:27:14,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And know that it didn't mean I took a picture of my balls.

2008
02:27:15,425 --> 02:27:18,648
[SPEAKER_07]: What if you draw a smiley face on your penis?

2009
02:27:18,689 --> 02:27:19,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that...

2010
02:27:21,506 --> 02:27:23,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I used my Mabinogi screenshot of my character.

2011
02:27:24,148 --> 02:27:26,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to watch yourself get killed by Jeff Bridges.

2012
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:27,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Just thought you'd think it was cool.

2013
02:27:28,672 --> 02:27:35,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, second, if I were to start World of Warcraft on the original expansion, would I just be locked out of the places or should I get Cataclysm and start there?

2014
02:27:37,488 --> 02:27:37,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

2015
02:27:37,928 --> 02:27:39,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Cataclysm won't work without the regular game.

2016
02:27:39,929 --> 02:27:41,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting a lot of WoW questions.

2017
02:27:41,610 --> 02:27:43,791
[SPEAKER_09]: HordeHousePodcast at gmail.com.

2018
02:27:43,831 --> 02:27:44,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

2019
02:27:45,111 --> 02:27:46,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you have to have all the other expansions?

2020
02:27:46,632 --> 02:27:47,032
[SPEAKER_09]: You do.

2021
02:27:47,152 --> 02:27:47,412
[SPEAKER_09]: You do.

2022
02:27:47,452 --> 02:27:49,193
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing, and a lot of people are missing this.

2023
02:27:49,613 --> 02:27:56,616
[SPEAKER_09]: When they released the Cataclysm, when they released the Kraken, or Deathwing in this case, they evolved Old World permanently.

2024
02:27:57,196 --> 02:28:03,378
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have World of Warcraft and nothing but, if you have vanilla WoW, you will still get the new WoW experience.

2025
02:28:03,538 --> 02:28:05,699
[SPEAKER_09]: The Old World is gone permanently.

2026
02:28:06,525 --> 02:28:08,806
[SPEAKER_09]: So it makes it a really good experience.

2027
02:28:09,767 --> 02:28:13,429
[SPEAKER_09]: There are other enhancements that make the Cataclysm worth purchasing.

2028
02:28:13,469 --> 02:28:14,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But is Mr. T still there?

2029
02:28:15,470 --> 02:28:16,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe he is.

2030
02:28:17,311 --> 02:28:19,252
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not outside the cities anymore, but he'll come back.

2031
02:28:19,632 --> 02:28:29,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Such as, and just a short list, the ability to level to 85, new dungeons and raids that come with that, the fact that you can roll a worgen or a goblin, and worgen is going to be a huge race.

2032
02:28:30,018 --> 02:28:31,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's tons of furries that want to play worgens.

2033
02:28:36,606 --> 02:28:42,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm half tempted if somebody gets me the game to put Star Trek Online aside to give it a try.

2034
02:28:42,408 --> 02:28:54,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's one other thing I want to throw out there, and that is now is an excellent time to suck yourself back into the world of Warcraft because Blizzard's been having this huge sale, and I don't know if it's over yet or not, but Vanilla WoW, five bucks.

2035
02:28:54,953 --> 02:28:56,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Burning Crusade, five bucks.

2036
02:28:57,193 --> 02:28:58,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Wrath, ten bucks.

2037
02:28:59,214 --> 02:29:00,576
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 bucks, get you caught up to current.

2038
02:29:00,596 --> 02:29:01,477
[SPEAKER_07]: They even had one.

2039
02:29:01,497 --> 02:29:03,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I already had the other two, the first two.

2040
02:29:03,659 --> 02:29:05,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it was going on during the sale though or whatever.

2041
02:29:06,262 --> 02:29:10,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, you buy it at GameStop for $15, you get a $15 gift card.

2042
02:29:10,347 --> 02:29:11,788
[SPEAKER_09]: You get it for free basically.

2043
02:29:11,869 --> 02:29:12,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2044
02:29:13,530 --> 02:29:15,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see if that sale is still going on.

2045
02:29:15,312 --> 02:29:20,338
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, if that sale is still going on, I will buy you Wrath of the Lich King as a Hanukkah present.

2046
02:29:21,843 --> 02:29:22,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2047
02:29:23,786 --> 02:29:24,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it a try again.

2048
02:29:24,988 --> 02:29:25,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, shit.

2049
02:29:26,830 --> 02:29:29,935
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I love Star Trek Online, I can alternate months.

2050
02:29:30,836 --> 02:29:31,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

2051
02:29:33,015 --> 02:29:35,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, except I don't want to have to go out and buy Cataclysm.

2052
02:29:36,337 --> 02:29:39,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I, on the other hand, will not be joining the World of Warcraft.

2053
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:43,763
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have an interest, I'm not even going to try with you, you have a baby anyway.

2054
02:29:44,563 --> 02:29:48,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't join even the actual world right now, so.

2055
02:29:49,126 --> 02:29:54,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to say, as long as you don't want to roll a Worgen or a Goblin, there's not a lot for you until you get up to level 80.

2056
02:29:55,251 --> 02:29:58,493
[SPEAKER_02]: All I hear is blah, blah, wow, blah, blah, vanilla, blah, blah, blah.

2057
02:30:13,379 --> 02:30:15,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Puppies, rainbows, kittens, unicorns.

2058
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:16,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have your attention now?

2059
02:30:17,180 --> 02:30:17,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Naked men.

2060
02:30:19,321 --> 02:30:20,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Choaniki.

2061
02:30:20,282 --> 02:30:21,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Choaniki.

2062
02:30:22,722 --> 02:30:24,443
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm going to go finish.

2063
02:30:24,983 --> 02:30:27,464
[SPEAKER_09]: MajinamiCon and other big words I can think of.

2064
02:30:29,185 --> 02:30:29,405
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2065
02:30:29,505 --> 02:30:33,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, third, can you patch a UMD or download PSP import games to English?

2066
02:30:34,327 --> 02:30:37,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know that you can do that for the DS, so I was wondering.

2067
02:30:38,108 --> 02:30:40,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure with an emulator.

2068
02:30:40,149 --> 02:30:42,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's people that do that, but maybe.

2069
02:30:43,050 --> 02:30:44,632
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't be on UMD anymore.

2070
02:30:45,012 --> 02:30:48,436
[SPEAKER_09]: You would have to have this whole ROM thing and then you're getting into shady hacks.

2071
02:30:48,957 --> 02:30:50,578
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure it's possible.

2072
02:30:50,899 --> 02:30:54,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't ever doubt what the hacker community can do.

2073
02:30:54,903 --> 02:30:58,267
[SPEAKER_09]: But you'd have to go to the darker parts of the internet to find it.

2074
02:30:59,736 --> 02:31:00,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, one last thing.

2075
02:31:00,937 --> 02:31:04,559
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, in Comic Insanity, do you guys talk about anime as well?

2076
02:31:04,979 --> 02:31:08,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically not unless they have a comic attached to them, and not necessarily manga.

2077
02:31:08,261 --> 02:31:16,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We really focus on Marvel, DC, IDW, Udon, basically US-based companies.

2078
02:31:17,866 --> 02:31:20,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we've gone into a little bit of the manga before.

2079
02:31:20,727 --> 02:31:22,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's one of those inevitables.

2080
02:31:22,248 --> 02:31:27,451
[SPEAKER_09]: You know food is going to come up on OLR, and you know that manga's got to come up on Comic Insanity once in a while.

2081
02:31:28,030 --> 02:31:30,793
[SPEAKER_02]: and He Who Shall Not Be Named on Comic Insanity.

2082
02:31:31,034 --> 02:31:34,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And just like, and extroverts masturbation habits will come up on Horde House.

2083
02:31:34,898 --> 02:31:35,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

2084
02:31:35,859 --> 02:31:38,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, thank you, and DarkSakura, your grammar coaching is appreciated.

2085
02:31:38,842 --> 02:31:40,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you really appreciate it, you would have spelled grammar right.

2086
02:31:42,708 --> 02:31:42,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2087
02:31:43,329 --> 02:31:44,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get some comments from chat.

2088
02:31:44,429 --> 02:31:46,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com I love this comment.

2089
02:31:46,711 --> 02:31:52,976
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, So Jamie went from World of War crap to I might consider playing it over the course of an episode.

2090
02:31:53,616 --> 02:31:56,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I might consider playing it if someone else buys it for me.

2091
02:31:56,678 --> 02:31:58,760
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the awesome thing about Orange Launch Radio.

2092
02:31:58,780 --> 02:32:00,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey look, last week we went from

2093
02:32:01,562 --> 02:32:03,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Guy tweeting us saying, isn't this game cool?

2094
02:32:04,223 --> 02:32:06,803
[SPEAKER_09]: To having the creator on our show hours ago.

2095
02:32:07,983 --> 02:32:08,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Every gamer has a voice.

2096
02:32:08,904 --> 02:32:09,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this show.

2097
02:32:09,564 --> 02:32:10,024
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing.

2098
02:32:10,644 --> 02:32:15,005
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Dollar Bill in the chat says, shit, I'm still jonesing for DC Universe to try it out.

2099
02:32:15,485 --> 02:32:16,245
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

2100
02:32:17,746 --> 02:32:19,126
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs work, but it's awesome.

2101
02:32:19,506 --> 02:32:24,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, this is, if someone buys it for me, I would play it.

2102
02:32:24,267 --> 02:32:24,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

2103
02:32:25,047 --> 02:32:27,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means I'd have to give up Star Trek Online for a month.

2104
02:32:29,699 --> 02:32:31,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to be kicked out of my fleet.

2105
02:32:31,700 --> 02:32:32,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still have to think about it.

2106
02:32:33,301 --> 02:32:38,484
[SPEAKER_09]: SalaciousPop in our chatroom says, A UMD rip, which I've used, is like 500 to 900 megabytes.

2107
02:32:38,764 --> 02:32:40,105
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an awful lot to patch.

2108
02:32:40,565 --> 02:32:45,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, most torrented PSP games are just disk images, hence UMD rip.

2109
02:32:45,929 --> 02:32:48,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Text patches actually modify game files.

2110
02:32:48,770 --> 02:32:48,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

2111
02:32:49,511 --> 02:32:49,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I...

2112
02:32:50,271 --> 02:32:55,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have thought though, because you can do it so easily with, you know, like Super Nintendo ROMs and stuff.

2113
02:32:55,355 --> 02:32:59,458
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, what, the largest Super Nintendo images are what, 16, 32 megs?

2114
02:32:59,918 --> 02:33:03,240
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can see where it's probably a much bigger pain in the ass.

2115
02:33:04,081 --> 02:33:07,944
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, don't doubt the hacker community.

2116
02:33:07,984 --> 02:33:09,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Where there's a will, there's a way, right?

2117
02:33:11,246 --> 02:33:12,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.

2118
02:33:12,787 --> 02:33:13,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Any more emails tonight?

2119
02:33:14,148 --> 02:33:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they're still reading this email.

2120
02:33:15,609 --> 02:33:16,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my bad.

2121
02:33:17,629 --> 02:33:20,314
[SPEAKER_02]: and thanks for reading my email and if you didn't, what the fuck?

2122
02:33:20,415 --> 02:33:21,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, DarkSakura, fuck my life.

2123
02:33:22,879 --> 02:33:26,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And why would you let Rob lick Dan's balls just to mess with you?

2124
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:31,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, Dan made balls last week.

2125
02:33:31,281 --> 02:33:31,881
[SPEAKER_09]: We were eating them.

2126
02:33:31,901 --> 02:33:33,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you forget about your husband's balls?

2127
02:33:34,102 --> 02:33:35,822
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just now they're ground beef.

2128
02:33:36,302 --> 02:33:36,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

2129
02:33:36,742 --> 02:33:38,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Your loyal listener, Haseo Sumiragawa.

2130
02:33:39,383 --> 02:33:39,743
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

2131
02:33:39,843 --> 02:33:41,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get a woot from the Minnesota listeners?

2132
02:33:41,984 --> 02:33:43,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Garrett Hedlund, a.k.a.

2133
02:33:43,384 --> 02:33:48,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam Flynn, was born in Rosso, Minnesota, about 100 miles from where I live, and pissing distance from Canada.

2134
02:33:49,326 --> 02:33:50,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadia!

2135
02:33:50,626 --> 02:33:52,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron Legacy officially made a win.

2136
02:33:52,847 --> 02:33:55,548
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get a woot from the Minnesota listeners.

2137
02:33:59,476 --> 02:34:00,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure they're out there somewhere.

2138
02:34:01,136 --> 02:34:02,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have one last email.

2139
02:34:02,717 --> 02:34:02,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2140
02:34:03,517 --> 02:34:06,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one, you know, it's... Okay.

2141
02:34:07,599 --> 02:34:11,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to keep away from the political in charge stuff, but this is a good email.

2142
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:18,502
[SPEAKER_02]: With all the homophobia, don't ask, don't tell, Prop 8, among others, why does it matter if anyone is gay or not?

2143
02:34:19,163 --> 02:34:26,025
[SPEAKER_02]: The way people worry about being gay or being near someone gay, I can't help but make the comparison to the X-Men movie Fear People Had Towards Mutants.

2144
02:34:26,505 --> 02:34:28,646
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where mutants came from, kind of.

2145
02:34:30,106 --> 02:34:42,590
[SPEAKER_02]: All the arguments against gay marriage, gays in the military, gay teachers, to me, are unfounded and stupid, and the more they try to defend their position, by the way, there I spell T-H-E-I-R, not T-H-E-R-E, position, the more stupid and ignorant they get.

2146
02:34:42,890 --> 02:34:43,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.

2147
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:44,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for your spelling.

2148
02:34:45,351 --> 02:34:50,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope one day it just won't matter, there's an apostrophe in won't, and everyone is treated the same.

2149
02:34:52,633 --> 02:34:56,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote this email after talking this very subject with my wife several times.

2150
02:34:56,657 --> 02:35:01,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't figure out why it matters in everyday life if one is gay or not.

2151
02:35:02,223 --> 02:35:10,812
[SPEAKER_02]: What people do in the privacy of their own homes is their own business and why should it dictate if you can do a job to defend our country or get married?

2152
02:35:11,212 --> 02:35:14,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the email, not game related, but I just wanted your opinion on this again.

2153
02:35:15,336 --> 02:35:17,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a game-related part, so I'll read that next.

2154
02:35:18,098 --> 02:35:18,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with everything.

2155
02:35:19,059 --> 02:35:20,901
[SPEAKER_02]: You missed it earlier.

2156
02:35:20,921 --> 02:35:23,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my FKHH shirt.

2157
02:35:25,044 --> 02:35:38,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, what you're saying, I think, is the... I don't want to say the right viewpoint, but in a way, it's kind of like, in a perfect world, or hopefully in the world our children and our grandchildren live in, you're right.

2158
02:35:38,556 --> 02:35:39,717
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't be a big deal.

2159
02:35:39,937 --> 02:35:41,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just whatever.

2160
02:35:41,558 --> 02:35:42,199
[SPEAKER_09]: No one care.

2161
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:48,787
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think right now, I think sometimes, because there's two extremes to this.

2162
02:35:49,288 --> 02:35:59,501
[SPEAKER_09]: There isn't necessarily just the homophobic side, but then there is the side that likes to drag people out of the closet, so to speak, which I'm not necessarily sure I agree with either.

2163
02:35:59,521 --> 02:35:59,561
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2164
02:36:00,021 --> 02:36:28,731
[SPEAKER_09]: because there's people that don't want it to be that big of a factor that would prefer not to say that they're quote in the closet but that they just don't make it they don't for whatever reason want to make it a huge part of their life I think that one's life shouldn't necessarily be dictated by their sexuality yeah absolutely it's an aspect of the life but it's not your entire life I don't go around thinking about oh I'm gonna fuck Dan every day sorry

2165
02:36:30,632 --> 02:36:32,272
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2166
02:37:00,239 --> 02:37:01,880
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2167
02:37:25,414 --> 02:37:27,156
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you choose to pee sitting down?

2168
02:37:27,756 --> 02:37:29,338
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you choose to pee standing up?

2169
02:37:29,658 --> 02:37:30,859
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you choose to be gay?

2170
02:37:30,919 --> 02:37:32,180
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you choose to be straight?

2171
02:37:33,501 --> 02:37:34,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

2172
02:37:34,842 --> 02:37:36,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Matt, when did you choose to be straight?

2173
02:37:39,586 --> 02:37:40,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Boobies.

2174
02:37:41,788 --> 02:37:42,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2175
02:37:43,469 --> 02:37:44,270
[SPEAKER_07]: When did I choose?

2176
02:37:44,570 --> 02:37:44,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2177
02:37:45,351 --> 02:37:46,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I did choose.

2178
02:37:47,009 --> 02:37:47,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2179
02:37:47,929 --> 02:37:48,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Point.

2180
02:37:48,450 --> 02:37:51,831
[SPEAKER_09]: But Matt's also on the side of reasonableness.

2181
02:37:51,931 --> 02:37:54,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt is where the rest of America needs to be.

2182
02:37:54,953 --> 02:37:55,533
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

2183
02:37:55,893 --> 02:37:59,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And generally, our listenership, I think, is on that same page.

2184
02:37:59,515 --> 02:38:01,495
[SPEAKER_09]: That is promising more than anything.

2185
02:38:01,936 --> 02:38:04,657
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, obviously, it's no secret on this show, I'm gay.

2186
02:38:05,097 --> 02:38:05,417
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Rob!

2187
02:38:05,437 --> 02:38:07,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you couldn't tell.

2188
02:38:21,966 --> 02:38:22,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hold on, though.

2189
02:38:23,107 --> 02:38:27,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, for the longest time, we were doing a live show and then a separate podcast.

2190
02:38:27,609 --> 02:38:33,452
[SPEAKER_09]: So there were a lot of people that were listening to the podcast that weren't listening to the live show where the other talk was happening.

2191
02:38:33,792 --> 02:38:41,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas on the podcast, until we combined the shows, then it finally came out probably a year and a half after we've been podcasting.

2192
02:38:41,676 --> 02:38:44,017
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd mentioned some guy I'd been dating or whatever.

2193
02:38:44,057 --> 02:38:46,859
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was quite a few emails that came in that next week.

2194
02:38:47,979 --> 02:38:48,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2195
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:51,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't remember getting anything bad.

2196
02:38:51,261 --> 02:38:51,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2197
02:38:52,978 --> 02:38:55,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I got one that was a little iffy.

2198
02:38:55,602 --> 02:38:59,387
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't necessarily negative, but it was more of an I'll pray for you thing.

2199
02:38:59,988 --> 02:39:04,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was kind of one of those, you know, thanks, but no need.

2200
02:39:04,755 --> 02:39:06,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that if there's a higher power...

2201
02:39:07,538 --> 02:39:20,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I try to live my life to the best of moral being that I can and what higher power that is nothing but love is going to send me straight to hell to burn for an eternity for trying to be the best person I can be.

2202
02:39:21,191 --> 02:39:24,434
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a ridiculous and fear-mongering way of thinking.

2203
02:39:25,134 --> 02:39:27,617
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the whole way I look at it.

2204
02:39:27,657 --> 02:39:27,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like,

2205
02:39:29,654 --> 02:39:33,196
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, I'm trying to think.

2206
02:39:34,497 --> 02:39:40,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Lifestyle is like going out to the clubs and dying your hair blue.

2207
02:39:41,382 --> 02:39:43,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, if you want to be seen.

2208
02:39:43,283 --> 02:39:48,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, lifestyle is how you live your life.

2209
02:39:48,967 --> 02:39:50,327
[SPEAKER_02]: What you've chosen to do with your life.

2210
02:39:51,548 --> 02:39:53,829
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not lifestyle.

2211
02:39:53,909 --> 02:39:55,890
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just an aspect.

2212
02:39:55,970 --> 02:40:00,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It may contribute to your lifestyle, but it's not something that you choose to do.

2213
02:40:00,533 --> 02:40:01,013
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

2214
02:40:02,634 --> 02:40:03,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to make sense of this.

2215
02:40:03,935 --> 02:40:05,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mean to laugh at you.

2216
02:40:05,075 --> 02:40:10,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm laughing at chat because you know Alan said something funny, so I'll read it in a minute.

2217
02:40:10,418 --> 02:40:14,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It really shouldn't have to do with anything.

2218
02:40:15,821 --> 02:40:17,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be anybody else's freaking business.

2219
02:40:19,748 --> 02:40:31,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, let's see, Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, quote, I will inform Jesus ASAP of your wrongdoing so that he may send his healy vagina beams at you so that you can go to heaven because I'm concerned about you so much.

2220
02:40:31,636 --> 02:40:33,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, and I don't mean to mock religion.

2221
02:40:33,337 --> 02:40:38,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a lot of good stuff that can come out of religion, but unfortunately there's also a lot of bad stuff that can come out.

2222
02:40:40,461 --> 02:40:41,242
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean, though?

2223
02:40:41,642 --> 02:40:42,142
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

2224
02:40:42,262 --> 02:40:46,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I never want to disrespect somebody's religion until that religion disrespects me.

2225
02:40:47,179 --> 02:40:49,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Lord Save Us From Your Followers

2226
02:41:07,582 --> 02:41:14,025
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole movie is basically him actually going out and striking up conversations with people to find out why they don't like Christians.

2227
02:41:14,645 --> 02:41:16,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Why they have a problem with evangelicals.

2228
02:41:16,926 --> 02:41:19,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually just going in and asking.

2229
02:41:20,667 --> 02:41:25,669
[SPEAKER_02]: He went to San Francisco, to Castro to talk to people.

2230
02:41:27,590 --> 02:41:29,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite a few fabulous drag queens on there too.

2231
02:41:31,095 --> 02:41:39,102
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point is that you need to stop being right and start respecting other people.

2232
02:41:40,062 --> 02:41:44,306
[SPEAKER_02]: That closed-minded, oh, this is the only way it can be.

2233
02:41:44,786 --> 02:41:47,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's because the Bible said this, or maybe my pastor said this.

2234
02:41:48,109 --> 02:41:50,230
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the only way it is, and all the rest of you are wrong.

2235
02:41:51,031 --> 02:41:54,874
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to automatically close the door on anything you have to say.

2236
02:41:56,505 --> 02:41:57,506
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2237
02:42:18,044 --> 02:42:45,718
[SPEAKER_09]: and the thing that gets me and just the idiot perspective and the people that have the biggest problem I think sometimes with homosexuality and even so much what they're saying the problem is with Don't Ask or why they need Don't Ask Don't Tell is that straight men or certain straight men are threatened because they don't want guys checking them out they don't want other guys checking them out and there's a part of me that goes A

2238
02:42:46,758 --> 02:42:47,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Get over yourself.

2239
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:53,342
[SPEAKER_09]: There's probably a lot of people that don't care less.

2240
02:42:53,462 --> 02:42:59,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because someone's gay, I don't find every guy in the world hot just because I happen to be gay.

2241
02:43:00,245 --> 02:43:02,386
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, there's quite a few ugly ones out there.

2242
02:43:02,406 --> 02:43:03,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to say it.

2243
02:43:04,928 --> 02:43:13,953
[SPEAKER_09]: But when people kind of have that perspective of like, well, I hope he's not gay because he's going to try to put it in my butt.

2244
02:43:14,918 --> 02:43:16,079
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2245
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:34,501
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the word?

2246
02:43:34,541 --> 02:43:36,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they so insecure?

2247
02:43:36,622 --> 02:43:37,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, insecure.

2248
02:43:37,743 --> 02:43:38,644
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the perfect word.

2249
02:43:49,291 --> 02:43:51,371
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be a level of attraction.

2250
02:43:51,551 --> 02:43:58,753
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not fully, I guess, swing that way to use the quote, but it has been proven, there's studies out there, that everyone carries a little bit.

2251
02:43:58,773 --> 02:44:07,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if not for, and I've said, I don't know that I've made this completely, I've talked to you about it before, but I mean, if not for Dan, I could easily have had a girlfriend.

2252
02:44:07,774 --> 02:44:11,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had flings, you know.

2253
02:44:11,855 --> 02:44:16,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, I'm completely attracted to everybody, I guess, you know.

2254
02:44:18,196 --> 02:44:18,436
[SPEAKER_02]: But,

2255
02:44:20,177 --> 02:44:23,579
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like I'm going to go up to someone and go, boobies!

2256
02:44:24,319 --> 02:44:24,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

2257
02:44:24,619 --> 02:44:26,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think you did that once when you were drunk.

2258
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:27,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I?

2259
02:44:28,021 --> 02:44:28,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding.

2260
02:44:28,821 --> 02:44:29,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

2261
02:44:29,462 --> 02:44:34,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say one thing, and I've told you this off the air before, but it did kind of gross me out when I saw you kiss a girl.

2262
02:44:35,625 --> 02:44:37,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was like, that's so wrong!

2263
02:44:37,746 --> 02:44:38,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Wrong!

2264
02:44:41,868 --> 02:44:42,429
[SPEAKER_09]: You were drunk.

2265
02:44:42,549 --> 02:44:43,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I have kissed women.

2266
02:44:43,669 --> 02:44:43,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2267
02:44:44,010 --> 02:44:44,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Big deal.

2268
02:44:46,637 --> 02:44:48,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It was dumb fun.

2269
02:44:48,178 --> 02:44:50,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It was stupid 12-year-old junior high stuff.

2270
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:51,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it grossed me out.

2271
02:44:51,301 --> 02:44:52,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that's so weird.

2272
02:44:52,722 --> 02:44:53,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.

2273
02:44:54,083 --> 02:44:55,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny, but yeah, back to the point.

2274
02:44:56,653 --> 02:45:00,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's interesting, but there was one other thing I wanted to say about this.

2275
02:45:00,594 --> 02:45:01,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here's the thing.

2276
02:45:02,055 --> 02:45:07,836
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're that guy that's really afraid of another guy hitting on you or whatever, here's a simple line to use.

2277
02:45:08,336 --> 02:45:17,959
[SPEAKER_09]: If somebody ever reveals to you their secret man crush on you, brings you on the local talk show to out their crush or whatever on you, thanks, but no thanks.

2278
02:45:18,679 --> 02:45:21,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what, straight people have been using that line for a long time.

2279
02:45:22,400 --> 02:45:24,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Gay people use that line with each other too.

2280
02:45:24,581 --> 02:45:25,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, but no thanks.

2281
02:45:27,216 --> 02:45:27,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

2282
02:45:47,385 --> 02:45:48,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, thank you.

2283
02:45:48,966 --> 02:45:49,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taken.

2284
02:45:50,786 --> 02:45:51,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that easy.

2285
02:45:51,726 --> 02:45:53,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wasn't expecting it.

2286
02:45:53,407 --> 02:45:57,728
[SPEAKER_09]: But you came out of there and you were like, oh, hey, I'm looking hot today.

2287
02:45:58,148 --> 02:45:58,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you were there.

2288
02:45:59,329 --> 02:46:00,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I was tickled all day.

2289
02:46:00,609 --> 02:46:02,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, she thought I was cute.

2290
02:46:02,150 --> 02:46:03,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it nice to get a compliment?

2291
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:04,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2292
02:46:05,111 --> 02:46:07,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was like, that's so cool.

2293
02:46:07,591 --> 02:46:12,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there wouldn't be a single person in this universe I would cheat on while I'm with Dan.

2294
02:46:13,253 --> 02:46:13,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never.

2295
02:46:14,533 --> 02:46:16,074
[SPEAKER_09]: What about Margaret Cho circa 10 years ago?

2296
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:23,822
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I am completely and utterly dedicated to my husband.

2297
02:46:24,222 --> 02:46:27,143
[SPEAKER_02]: You are completely and utterly dedicated to Alan.

2298
02:46:28,624 --> 02:46:32,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matt here is completely and utterly dedicated to his phone right now.

2299
02:46:34,887 --> 02:46:35,587
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

2300
02:46:38,409 --> 02:46:41,370
[SPEAKER_02]: You clearly love your wife very much.

2301
02:46:42,571 --> 02:46:44,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2302
02:46:44,292 --> 02:46:44,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

2303
02:46:45,451 --> 02:46:50,897
[SPEAKER_02]: All of us in this room, we have found our person.

2304
02:46:51,497 --> 02:46:53,639
[SPEAKER_02]: We are very happy people.

2305
02:46:55,821 --> 02:47:02,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that level of security that even if we weren't with our significant others, that we'd just say, you know what, thanks, but no.

2306
02:47:02,988 --> 02:47:03,068
Hmm.

2307
02:47:04,244 --> 02:47:05,084
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2308
02:47:05,104 --> 02:47:06,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say this in the chat because this is so good.

2309
02:47:07,425 --> 02:47:10,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad from PodCulture Interim says, if someone is checking you out, be flattered.

2310
02:47:11,185 --> 02:47:12,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if they stalk you, different story.

2311
02:47:13,166 --> 02:47:13,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely right.

2312
02:47:14,026 --> 02:47:18,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't matter what the genders are in that case too because stalking is when it crosses the line.

2313
02:47:18,806 --> 02:47:27,028
[SPEAKER_09]: When thanks, no thanks doesn't get the message across like it should to most reasonable people, that's a whole nother problem.

2314
02:47:27,068 --> 02:47:31,629
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is free of whatever sexuality happens to be the case.

2315
02:47:32,029 --> 02:47:33,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, stalking is never cool.

2316
02:47:34,677 --> 02:47:42,204
[SPEAKER_09]: So if someone tells you thanks but no thanks, try for a friendship or go fishing again.

2317
02:47:42,404 --> 02:47:45,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had times where the first time I've been like, no, I'm not really interested.

2318
02:47:45,967 --> 02:47:47,449
[SPEAKER_02]: They came back a week later and said, you know what?

2319
02:47:48,970 --> 02:47:50,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I still would really like to try.

2320
02:47:50,171 --> 02:47:51,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you give me a chance?

2321
02:47:51,812 --> 02:47:53,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be okay.

2322
02:47:53,134 --> 02:47:54,054
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'll give you a chance.

2323
02:47:54,635 --> 02:47:56,176
[SPEAKER_02]: The third time, no, that's creepy.

2324
02:47:57,257 --> 02:47:58,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you're cute!

2325
02:48:24,548 --> 02:48:25,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll grow out of you.

2326
02:48:25,910 --> 02:48:27,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be here to pick you up when you're off work.

2327
02:48:27,571 --> 02:48:36,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I am... This is right when Dan and I were first, you know, considering each other.

2328
02:48:37,342 --> 02:48:39,143
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was like, dude, I'm not interested.

2329
02:48:39,364 --> 02:48:41,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, thank you, but no, I'm not interested.

2330
02:48:41,926 --> 02:48:42,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be here.

2331
02:48:43,328 --> 02:48:46,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll have you know that our security guard is an ex-Army Ranger.

2332
02:48:48,314 --> 02:48:49,915
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll be calling him to be here.

2333
02:48:50,715 --> 02:48:51,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So the guy didn't show up.

2334
02:48:53,536 --> 02:49:00,719
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm saying, you know, you've got to be confident in yourself and take it as a compliment.

2335
02:49:01,019 --> 02:49:03,680
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone is checking you out, go, yeah, huh?

2336
02:49:04,781 --> 02:49:05,221
[SPEAKER_02]: In your head.

2337
02:49:05,361 --> 02:49:07,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you're not sure, go, no, thank you.

2338
02:49:08,162 --> 02:49:14,705
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not loony and crazy and, you know, bizarre and shocking, then they'll go, well, okay.

2339
02:49:15,045 --> 02:49:17,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sad face puppy eyes at you and then go pout.

2340
02:49:17,881 --> 02:49:26,145
[SPEAKER_09]: But if, again, just to try and bring closure to this, if you're one of those guys or girls or whatever that's like, I want someone of the same gender checking me out, then you know what?

2341
02:49:26,185 --> 02:49:29,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Your attitude is probably not attractive and no one is probably checking you out.

2342
02:49:30,567 --> 02:49:31,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Just food for thought.

2343
02:49:32,388 --> 02:49:33,889
[SPEAKER_09]: How about the game part of the email?

2344
02:49:34,389 --> 02:49:35,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Game related stuff.

2345
02:49:35,270 --> 02:49:38,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Earth Defense Force is one of my favorite games and can't wait for Earth Defense Force 2.

2346
02:49:38,672 --> 02:49:40,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope it is online co-op.

2347
02:49:41,033 --> 02:49:41,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Great ship.

2348
02:49:41,696 --> 02:49:42,696
[SPEAKER_07]: It is online co-op.

2349
02:49:42,736 --> 02:49:43,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Three player.

2350
02:49:44,177 --> 02:49:44,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Great show.

2351
02:49:44,897 --> 02:49:45,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the great work.

2352
02:49:45,978 --> 02:49:49,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, and the honesty you have toward life and gaming.

2353
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:52,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a compliment.

2354
02:49:52,300 --> 02:49:54,681
[SPEAKER_02]: The honesty we have towards life and gaming.

2355
02:49:54,701 --> 02:49:59,343
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been a week of warm fuzzies for as far as compliments go and so forth.

2356
02:49:59,383 --> 02:50:03,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realize it's not been a warm fuzzy week for everybody out there in the world.

2357
02:50:04,085 --> 02:50:06,586
[SPEAKER_09]: What with just, God, the economy in general.

2358
02:50:06,626 --> 02:50:09,527
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems like we always have these stories about closures and other things.

2359
02:50:09,728 --> 02:50:10,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me feel tingly.

2360
02:50:11,195 --> 02:50:13,896
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does feel nice to get paid a compliment.

2361
02:50:13,956 --> 02:50:16,338
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been paid several this week and totally unsolicited.

2362
02:50:16,938 --> 02:50:19,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like my next compliment in the form of money.

2363
02:50:19,839 --> 02:50:20,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

2364
02:50:20,580 --> 02:50:21,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

2365
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:21,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

2366
02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:22,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2367
02:50:22,520 --> 02:50:22,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2368
02:50:22,841 --> 02:50:23,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2369
02:50:23,361 --> 02:50:24,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other emails tonight?

2370
02:50:25,422 --> 02:50:25,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Too many.

2371
02:50:26,022 --> 02:50:27,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

2372
02:50:27,363 --> 02:50:28,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sorry to those that didn't get through.

2373
02:50:28,743 --> 02:50:30,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, you just picked the wrong week, I guess.

2374
02:50:31,205 --> 02:50:32,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

2375
02:50:33,846 --> 02:50:34,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Try again.

2376
02:50:34,566 --> 02:50:35,887
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get to you at some point.

2377
02:50:36,178 --> 02:50:38,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, this is the part of the show where we do the FUs of the week.

2378
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:39,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it sounds weird.

2379
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:42,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I just talked about, like, oh, what a warm, fuzzy week, and now I'm like, alright, time to rant.

2380
02:50:45,564 --> 02:50:46,064
[SPEAKER_09]: But here we go.

2381
02:50:55,911 --> 02:50:58,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.

2382
02:50:59,733 --> 02:51:00,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

2383
02:51:01,074 --> 02:51:01,674
[SPEAKER_09]: You alright over there?

2384
02:51:01,694 --> 02:51:02,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm fine.

2385
02:51:02,715 --> 02:51:04,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, FU to, uh...

2386
02:51:06,724 --> 02:51:06,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki,

2387
02:51:32,702 --> 02:51:37,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, FU the stupid overclocked program because it only knows how to underclock and that's not what I want.

2388
02:51:37,766 --> 02:51:44,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, my FU of the week goes to traffic and people that don't know how to drive in the rain.

2389
02:51:44,750 --> 02:51:47,192
[SPEAKER_09]: My god, some of you California people are so spoiled.

2390
02:51:47,232 --> 02:51:50,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the rain here is nothing and just, it rains and people don't know what they're doing.

2391
02:51:51,355 --> 02:51:51,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah!

2392
02:51:52,175 --> 02:51:52,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so FU to that.

2393
02:51:53,276 --> 02:52:01,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, uh, FU to the fact that I just, I have a very, very busy week and weeks ahead and not that that's necessarily bad, but,

2394
02:52:02,342 --> 02:52:02,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2395
02:52:04,223 --> 02:52:06,804
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the fact I can't just sit on my ass and be lazy all day.

2396
02:52:09,064 --> 02:52:10,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Some days that's what I want to do.

2397
02:52:11,265 --> 02:52:11,565
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2398
02:52:12,185 --> 02:52:14,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on to a couple more stories.

2399
02:52:14,826 --> 02:52:16,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2400
02:52:16,847 --> 02:52:18,007
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2401
02:52:18,207 --> 02:52:18,747
[SPEAKER_09]: But not just yet.

2402
02:52:18,767 --> 02:52:19,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fuck this.

2403
02:52:21,168 --> 02:52:22,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't say that to the chatters.

2404
02:52:22,409 --> 02:52:23,449
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not the chatters.

2405
02:52:23,809 --> 02:52:23,989
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2406
02:52:24,909 --> 02:52:29,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It's having to be the print preview at 8.45 in the morning, which I guess is better than 6 in the morning.

2407
02:52:30,808 --> 02:52:31,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you have to get up early tomorrow?

2408
02:52:32,509 --> 02:52:33,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking A. Lame.

2409
02:52:34,330 --> 02:52:34,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Lame!

2410
02:52:34,890 --> 02:52:36,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, how about some more stories?

2411
02:52:36,471 --> 02:52:37,331
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm looking forward to going.

2412
02:52:37,511 --> 02:52:37,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

2413
02:52:39,332 --> 02:52:39,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2414
02:52:39,832 --> 02:52:42,354
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is neat.

2415
02:52:46,376 --> 02:52:46,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually...

2416
02:52:48,956 --> 02:52:51,517
[SPEAKER_07]: The Michael Jackson game.

2417
02:52:51,757 --> 02:52:54,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I'm not necessarily one to get it on the DS.

2418
02:52:55,278 --> 02:52:59,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the Wii, maybe the Kinect and stuff when that comes out because it's supposed to be just like Just Dance.

2419
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:07,883
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the DS, of course, they've done some very specific things if you try to, say, pirate the ROM.

2420
02:53:09,003 --> 02:53:11,304
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of neat, and I know Jamie will get a kick out of this.

2421
02:53:11,884 --> 02:53:19,367
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that they do, first off, is they have Vuvuzela playing on top of all the songs during the game.

2422
02:53:19,527 --> 02:53:23,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, they render the game's touchscreen non-functional.

2423
02:53:23,429 --> 02:53:29,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't get to play the game and you don't get to listen to the music untainted by the Vuvuzela.

2424
02:53:30,972 --> 02:53:32,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it!

2425
02:53:32,633 --> 02:53:34,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do that just for the Vuvuzela.

2426
02:53:35,067 --> 02:53:40,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to admit, as much as I hate it when she breaks it out on the show, I think that is a really funny anti-piracy measure.

2427
02:53:40,372 --> 02:53:44,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think more companies, you know, if they want to fight piracy, they should be doing it this way.

2428
02:53:46,196 --> 02:53:48,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I will have you know this.

2429
02:53:52,737 --> 02:54:14,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually played a real Vuvuzela this week one of my friends was having a birthday party and one of the other friends that came to the party brought a Vuvuzela with her and so I played it and it took me a minute to figure out how to play it like the first couple times I was doing it it just kind of sounded like a really loud wet fart but once I was able to get it it was kind of fun

2430
02:54:16,058 --> 02:54:16,738
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there you go.

2431
02:54:16,818 --> 02:54:17,959
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you taking pictures of me for?

2432
02:54:18,099 --> 02:54:18,539
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this for?

2433
02:54:18,559 --> 02:54:19,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to take my soul?

2434
02:54:20,520 --> 02:54:20,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2435
02:54:21,581 --> 02:54:22,701
[SPEAKER_09]: She's stealing your soul!

2436
02:54:25,763 --> 02:54:26,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Your soul is hers.

2437
02:54:26,904 --> 02:54:27,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Dead air.

2438
02:54:28,765 --> 02:54:29,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what she's doing.

2439
02:54:29,645 --> 02:54:32,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded an iPhone app that's like... Is this a fat booth program?

2440
02:54:33,167 --> 02:54:34,588
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't.

2441
02:54:34,788 --> 02:54:36,289
[SPEAKER_01]: It does gal-style hair.

2442
02:54:36,309 --> 02:54:38,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God!

2443
02:54:39,331 --> 02:54:40,511
[SPEAKER_09]: What is wrong with you?

2444
02:54:40,792 --> 02:54:42,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to put that on the website?

2445
02:54:42,192 --> 02:54:42,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2446
02:54:44,741 --> 02:54:47,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I think then I should get to do the unicorn pic of you.

2447
02:54:47,367 --> 02:54:49,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2448
02:54:50,335 --> 02:54:51,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do the unicorn picture here in a minute.

2449
02:54:54,747 --> 02:54:56,268
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw in our chat says, I'm Rob.

2450
02:54:56,288 --> 02:54:58,050
[SPEAKER_09]: That isn't one of Vuvuzela's sounds like a wet fart.

2451
02:54:58,270 --> 02:54:59,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I was playing it wrong.

2452
02:54:59,351 --> 02:54:59,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I told you.

2453
02:55:02,434 --> 02:55:03,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find a better hairstyle.

2454
02:55:03,895 --> 02:55:05,057
[SPEAKER_09]: One more story for you guys.

2455
02:55:05,517 --> 02:55:07,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I got to take the picture of the unicorn.

2456
02:55:07,158 --> 02:55:08,520
[SPEAKER_09]: So Loki's going to have to take the calls tonight.

2457
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:09,120
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2458
02:55:09,501 --> 02:55:12,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, this is a game and I don't even know what to think of this.

2459
02:55:13,544 --> 02:55:15,186
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a game called Cock Out.

2460
02:55:15,947 --> 02:55:16,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a...

2461
02:55:21,158 --> 02:55:21,438
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

2462
02:55:51,311 --> 02:55:52,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised you're not still giggling.

2463
02:55:53,192 --> 02:55:56,193
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just basically all these guys that look like they're whacking it.

2464
02:55:56,933 --> 02:55:59,214
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess they're supposed to be playing this game.

2465
02:55:59,554 --> 02:56:04,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the part that gets me is that, okay, I just reported on this and it's all over the game blogs and so forth.

2466
02:56:06,116 --> 02:56:07,476
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the actual game?

2467
02:56:07,716 --> 02:56:09,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are all these guys looking like they're jerking it?

2468
02:56:09,957 --> 02:56:11,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that, that's it?

2469
02:56:12,498 --> 02:56:17,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any type of strategy or anything to it or any, why am I asking these questions?

2470
02:56:18,020 --> 02:56:18,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course not.

2471
02:56:20,666 --> 02:56:21,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Why am I even bothering, right?

2472
02:56:25,090 --> 02:56:26,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you taking another picture of me?

2473
02:56:27,191 --> 02:56:28,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, hurry up.

2474
02:56:28,512 --> 02:56:31,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, can you give the phone information while she takes this damn picture?

2475
02:56:32,455 --> 02:56:34,417
[SPEAKER_07]: So, to Skype us, 1-877-GAME-OLR

2476
02:56:38,758 --> 02:56:41,921
[SPEAKER_07]: and do that via Skype or via the 1-800 number.

2477
02:56:42,401 --> 02:56:44,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on Skype, what was it?

2478
02:56:44,223 --> 02:56:45,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio?

2479
02:56:45,184 --> 02:56:47,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2480
02:56:47,466 --> 02:56:49,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2481
02:56:49,988 --> 02:56:51,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Our Skype line is now open.

2482
02:56:51,930 --> 02:56:52,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us a call.

2483
02:56:54,432 --> 02:56:54,933
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2484
02:56:55,793 --> 02:57:00,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you need one of those pictures of Loki.

2485
02:57:01,018 --> 02:57:02,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any last minute stories for us, Loki?

2486
02:57:04,039 --> 02:57:04,940
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not next.

2487
02:57:05,901 --> 02:57:06,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2488
02:57:06,522 --> 02:57:08,884
[SPEAKER_07]: You missed having a mistake with somebody else.

2489
02:57:09,085 --> 02:57:09,385
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2490
02:57:09,705 --> 02:57:11,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get the DarkSakura's unicorn picture real quick here.

2491
02:57:12,668 --> 02:57:15,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the meantime, do you have any last-minute stories while we wait for some calls?

2492
02:57:16,343 --> 02:57:21,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was just going to mention how awesome Swords & Poker 2 is on the iOS platform.

2493
02:57:21,946 --> 02:57:23,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely need to check that out.

2494
02:57:23,387 --> 02:57:26,389
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't already, it's a pretty awesome role-playing game.

2495
02:57:26,769 --> 02:57:31,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not getting paid by them, which is disappointing because I can really use extra money.

2496
02:57:31,512 --> 02:57:33,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, who can't use extra money?

2497
02:57:34,093 --> 02:57:38,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully that's bought me enough time to get into the forum to where the extra stories are.

2498
02:57:38,956 --> 02:57:40,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have not been looking for extra stories.

2499
02:57:40,637 --> 02:57:41,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been playing with my phone.

2500
02:57:42,698 --> 02:57:43,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course...

2501
02:57:47,788 --> 02:57:48,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

2502
02:57:48,668 --> 02:57:49,709
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is this?

2503
02:57:51,049 --> 02:57:56,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently there is a NASCAR Superstar driving game that will let you race dumpsters.

2504
02:57:56,730 --> 02:57:57,691
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty funny.

2505
02:57:59,971 --> 02:58:09,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Jimmy Johnson's Anything with an Engine is a brand new game and apparently lives up to its name and you can race a dumpster with a rocket apparently on it.

2506
02:58:10,034 --> 02:58:11,094
[SPEAKER_07]: That is pretty awesome.

2507
02:58:13,666 --> 02:58:15,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I'm not sure if anyone saw this this week.

2508
02:58:15,567 --> 02:58:17,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure a lot of people have.

2509
02:58:17,648 --> 02:58:23,352
[SPEAKER_07]: The custom Tron bikes that they had out there, the light cycles, pretty awesome, except for the fact that they don't glow.

2510
02:58:23,572 --> 02:58:24,633
[SPEAKER_02]: They're completely unrideable.

2511
02:58:25,534 --> 02:58:26,554
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not unrideable.

2512
02:58:26,614 --> 02:58:28,015
[SPEAKER_02]: They look way uncomfortable.

2513
02:58:29,076 --> 02:58:32,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to push them to get them going and you don't fall over.

2514
02:58:33,879 --> 02:58:38,142
[SPEAKER_07]: How they have that four-wheel vehicle that they have now, they should have made that instead.

2515
02:58:39,183 --> 02:58:41,785
[SPEAKER_02]: How the crap do you change the tire?

2516
02:58:42,839 --> 02:58:46,293
[SPEAKER_07]: you can't, it's a custom tire see?

2517
02:58:46,855 --> 02:58:47,518
[SPEAKER_02]: waste of money

2518
02:58:49,561 --> 02:58:51,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to mention DJ Hero 2.

2519
02:58:51,823 --> 02:58:55,164
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got some new download content coming out for that, which is pretty exciting.

2520
02:58:56,085 --> 02:58:57,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially since it's got more Prodigy in it.

2521
02:58:58,546 --> 02:59:04,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the songs I was hoping to make it into the game to begin with that didn't, but now it has.

2522
02:59:05,170 --> 02:59:09,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Invaders Must Die mixed with Debaser from the Pixies.

2523
02:59:09,753 --> 02:59:10,593
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

2524
02:59:10,713 --> 02:59:14,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Beastie Boys Body Movin' mixed with Lenny Kravitz, Rock and Roll is Dead.

2525
02:59:14,795 --> 02:59:16,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, this stuff is already out.

2526
02:59:16,316 --> 02:59:17,197
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out this week.

2527
02:59:18,197 --> 02:59:20,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week, actually two weeks from now, the old school pack.

2528
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:24,861
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have Fat Boys with Human Beatbox mixed with Mantronics.

2529
02:59:26,061 --> 02:59:26,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Mantronics.

2530
02:59:27,062 --> 02:59:28,002
[SPEAKER_07]: King of Beats.

2531
02:59:28,083 --> 02:59:31,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, Kurt Mantronics is fucking awesome.

2532
02:59:31,344 --> 02:59:32,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Tag Team, whoomp, there it is.

2533
02:59:33,225 --> 02:59:34,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again in another game.

2534
02:59:35,026 --> 02:59:38,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Mixed with 45 King, the 900 number.

2535
02:59:39,308 --> 02:59:43,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Beastie Boys, Triple Trouble mixed with Tone Lock, Funky Cold Medina.

2536
02:59:45,512 --> 02:59:51,777
[SPEAKER_07]: and then December 21st, Linkin Park Mix Pack with the Catalyst Does It Offend You?

2537
02:59:52,117 --> 02:59:58,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, remix and then When They Come For Me remix and Points of Authority remix.

2538
02:59:58,663 --> 02:59:59,984
[SPEAKER_07]: The Points of Authority is going to be awesome.

2539
03:00:00,464 --> 03:00:02,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I have a call sitting on hold, sorry.

2540
03:00:02,585 --> 03:00:03,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Caller, you're on the air.

2541
03:00:03,405 --> 03:00:04,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2542
03:00:04,266 --> 03:00:04,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2543
03:00:05,346 --> 03:00:08,687
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Ranma, and this time I wasn't even trying to get on before everybody else.

2544
03:00:08,767 --> 03:00:16,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, you know, I was so distracted because I was taking the picture of Jamie and making a unicorn out of her because I'm looking at these, what the hell are these pictures on the website?

2545
03:00:16,330 --> 03:00:17,431
[SPEAKER_09]: You have problems.

2546
03:00:18,491 --> 03:00:19,091
[SPEAKER_09]: You know you love them.

2547
03:00:19,111 --> 03:00:20,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I look like a Parapara girl in these pictures.

2548
03:00:20,852 --> 03:00:21,912
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly it.

2549
03:00:21,952 --> 03:00:23,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to make this my Facebook picture.

2550
03:00:26,641 --> 03:00:27,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.

2551
03:00:27,181 --> 03:00:28,242
[SPEAKER_09]: You should totally do it, Ranma.

2552
03:00:28,282 --> 03:00:28,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I will.

2553
03:00:29,142 --> 03:00:29,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Ranma.

2554
03:00:29,902 --> 03:00:37,965
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, check OrangeLaunchRadio.com in just a few seconds because I should have Jamie's unicorn picture up there in a minute where it looks like the cat is jerking off her horn.

2555
03:00:38,105 --> 03:00:38,525
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing.

2556
03:00:38,945 --> 03:00:39,206
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2557
03:00:39,546 --> 03:00:40,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Ranma.

2558
03:00:40,566 --> 03:00:41,006
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

2559
03:00:43,967 --> 03:00:44,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2560
03:00:45,508 --> 03:00:46,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it, Scott.

2561
03:00:46,088 --> 03:00:48,489
[SPEAKER_06]: You surely don't have a way of derailing, don't you?

2562
03:00:48,877 --> 03:00:49,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, you know what?

2563
03:00:50,037 --> 03:00:55,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I just want to point out, I want to remind you, our guest tonight made a game called Techno Kitten Adventure.

2564
03:00:55,820 --> 03:00:57,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I downloaded.

2565
03:00:57,260 --> 03:00:57,801
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you think?

2566
03:00:58,861 --> 03:01:06,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it yet because I found a Moe Japanese game on the live marketplace, downloaded that, and had my roommate playing it for the last 20 minutes.

2567
03:01:07,164 --> 03:01:07,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2568
03:01:08,125 --> 03:01:08,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2569
03:01:09,045 --> 03:01:10,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm looking at JB's picture.

2570
03:01:10,946 --> 03:01:12,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight's been a great night for pictures.

2571
03:01:12,526 --> 03:01:16,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, excuse me, so what did you call in to talk about tonight?

2572
03:01:17,591 --> 03:01:23,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to talk about a couple of things, but it turns into a lot of things, but I'll make it short and sweet as possible.

2573
03:01:24,175 --> 03:01:31,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, this whole German AIDS thing, for obvious reasons, I'm kind of sort of offended by it, but I'll let that be.

2574
03:01:32,141 --> 03:01:33,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, why are you offended by this?

2575
03:01:34,882 --> 03:01:35,663
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just whacking.

2576
03:01:35,683 --> 03:01:38,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just say I have people in my family who have died of said disease.

2577
03:01:40,166 --> 03:01:40,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

2578
03:01:40,467 --> 03:01:42,429
[SPEAKER_09]: So you find this to be disrespectful.

2579
03:01:42,949 --> 03:01:43,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2580
03:01:43,570 --> 03:01:43,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

2581
03:01:45,212 --> 03:01:46,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, interesting.

2582
03:01:46,393 --> 03:01:56,025
[SPEAKER_09]: This is interesting because, well, is it just disrespectful because it seems to be so trashy and in your face type of thing?

2583
03:01:56,746 --> 03:01:58,628
[SPEAKER_09]: That pretty much is the case.

2584
03:02:00,242 --> 03:02:12,129
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think about this whole, I've got to pick your brain on this, and I'm sorry because I know this is a sensitive issue to you, but I want to ask this question because this is something that's been on my mind this week, and it really has nothing to do with gaming, but whatever.

2585
03:02:12,169 --> 03:02:13,490
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been an interesting Part B tonight.

2586
03:02:14,410 --> 03:02:26,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen that whole campaign of the celebrities who have quit Twitter to try and raise a million dollars for AIDS awareness where they're all lying in the coffins dead and so forth?

2587
03:02:27,258 --> 03:02:28,579
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think of that whole thing?

2588
03:02:29,907 --> 03:02:39,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was quite ridiculous, and I don't know if you saw, but on my personal Facebook page, I made a statement about that, and a few people agreed with me about it.

2589
03:02:39,681 --> 03:02:40,462
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I missed it.

2590
03:02:41,764 --> 03:02:42,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll link it to you later.

2591
03:02:43,346 --> 03:02:45,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I have made a personal statement about how I truly felt.

2592
03:02:46,858 --> 03:02:53,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And can you summarize it or am I getting a little too... Long story short, I understand this epidemic.

2593
03:02:54,562 --> 03:02:59,604
[SPEAKER_06]: But instead of dealing with the whole world event, let's take care of America first.

2594
03:02:59,644 --> 03:03:05,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take care of the AIDS issue and the US first before we go running around taking care of everybody else.

2595
03:03:05,387 --> 03:03:12,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Why give all that money to those world charities when you can send that same amount of money to American charities for the same cause?

2596
03:03:13,351 --> 03:03:17,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I would hope that we can find a cure, and that'll be good for everybody.

2597
03:03:17,576 --> 03:03:19,058
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my hope.

2598
03:03:20,299 --> 03:03:20,620
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2599
03:03:20,900 --> 03:03:25,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I didn't mean to derail, but what else is on your mind tonight besides potentially offensive games?

2600
03:03:26,707 --> 03:03:32,513
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing about people not being able to get over themselves because guys make these compliments and so forth.

2601
03:03:32,714 --> 03:03:32,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

2602
03:03:34,167 --> 03:03:35,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was amusing and so did they.

2603
03:03:35,688 --> 03:03:36,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no problem with it.

2604
03:04:01,846 --> 03:04:13,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, like I'm sure, you know, a lot of straight people have that friend of the opposite gender, like a guy, a straight guy has that girl that he flirts with, but it's nothing more than that, you know?

2605
03:04:14,517 --> 03:04:22,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure there's, you probably have girl, not just gay guys, but girlfriends, not, I don't know, friend girls that you do that with too, you know?

2606
03:04:23,410 --> 03:04:24,350
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2607
03:04:44,997 --> 03:04:46,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, okay.

2608
03:04:46,317 --> 03:04:47,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you that.

2609
03:04:48,038 --> 03:04:49,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else on your mind, Ranma, before I let you go and get more calls?

2610
03:04:50,539 --> 03:04:53,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I played that ROM hack of Super Mario Bros.

2611
03:04:53,140 --> 03:04:53,120
3.

2612
03:04:53,160 --> 03:04:56,061
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing is three levels below Asshole Mario.

2613
03:04:59,382 --> 03:05:00,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Three levels below, huh?

2614
03:05:00,942 --> 03:05:02,683
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty precise rating.

2615
03:05:02,883 --> 03:05:07,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Ranma, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for your insight tonight.

2616
03:05:07,465 --> 03:05:08,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.

2617
03:05:08,065 --> 03:05:08,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

2618
03:05:10,461 --> 03:05:14,184
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I was just telling the significant other, we really need to go to New York City.

2619
03:05:14,204 --> 03:05:15,785
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we go, we're crashing with Ranma.

2620
03:05:16,866 --> 03:05:18,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Or as Hextafer would say, Ranny.

2621
03:05:19,107 --> 03:05:22,190
[SPEAKER_09]: So you better be careful because I really want to get back to New York City.

2622
03:05:22,230 --> 03:05:23,110
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a very long time.

2623
03:05:23,311 --> 03:05:25,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And my one friend that lived there moved to Texas.

2624
03:05:25,212 --> 03:05:28,714
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm coming to the couches of OLR listeners.

2625
03:05:32,772 --> 03:06:01,037
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio all one word if you want to give us a call we probably got time for about one more call we are running a little long tonight so probably because of the interview earlier meanwhile while we wait for the phone to ring Loki do you have any other last minute stories I don't know if you spent them all or what I've only done one of them so no I haven't spent them all alright then what else let's see what else can we talk about here how about how about I just look up here

2626
03:06:02,248 --> 03:06:03,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is this even open?

2627
03:06:03,969 --> 03:06:06,350
[SPEAKER_07]: It's odd.

2628
03:06:08,192 --> 03:06:10,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

2629
03:06:10,153 --> 03:06:14,535
[SPEAKER_09]: While I wait for your riveting last minute stories, let me go to at least one more call here.

2630
03:06:14,915 --> 03:06:15,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

2631
03:06:16,596 --> 03:06:16,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

2632
03:06:17,777 --> 03:06:19,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's Legend of Zaku here.

2633
03:06:19,278 --> 03:06:21,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, welcome to Orange Launch Radio, Legend of Zaku.

2634
03:06:22,840 --> 03:06:24,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, what's on your mind?

2635
03:06:25,616 --> 03:06:29,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just trying to kill a Sunday night before heading to work tomorrow.

2636
03:06:29,440 --> 03:06:36,706
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, a lot of games came out in the past couple weeks that I've been dying to talk about.

2637
03:06:37,486 --> 03:06:42,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously Gran Turismo 5, even though I don't have a PS3 yet, that's on my top list right now.

2638
03:06:43,826 --> 03:06:50,092
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're basically just trying to catch up on some other 360 games that I haven't been able to play.

2639
03:06:50,352 --> 03:06:52,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say I managed to get a 360 again.

2640
03:06:53,294 --> 03:06:53,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, talk to us.

2641
03:06:53,775 --> 03:06:54,536
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you been playing?

2642
03:06:54,676 --> 03:06:55,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing catch-up again.

2643
03:06:56,337 --> 03:06:57,138
[SPEAKER_09]: What have you been playing?

2644
03:06:58,839 --> 03:07:04,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I didn't have my 360, it was nothing but Left 4 Dead and Battlefield on my computer.

2645
03:07:04,501 --> 03:07:11,364
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm just playing small stuff like Sonic 4, Ace Combat 6, Resident Evil 5.

2646
03:07:12,044 --> 03:07:16,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Although hopefully my girlfriend will hook me up with more recent games for Christmas.

2647
03:07:17,386 --> 03:07:19,747
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already gave her a wish list of what to get me.

2648
03:07:19,987 --> 03:07:21,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you asked Santa for?

2649
03:07:22,051 --> 03:07:26,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, Santa and the four of my girlfriends is willing to spend money on me just as I'm willing to spend money on her.

2650
03:07:27,034 --> 03:07:27,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, very cool.

2651
03:07:28,314 --> 03:07:33,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, tell us about what's your favorite game been that you've discovered in the past couple weeks since you got your 360 back?

2652
03:07:34,717 --> 03:07:35,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

2653
03:07:35,118 --> 03:07:37,579
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Sonic 4 has been really challenging so far.

2654
03:07:38,019 --> 03:07:38,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

2655
03:07:38,279 --> 03:07:40,380
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of hate on Sonic 4.

2656
03:07:40,881 --> 03:07:42,301
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot, a lot of hate on Sonic 4.

2657
03:07:43,062 --> 03:07:43,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you disagree?

2658
03:07:43,842 --> 03:07:44,682
[SPEAKER_09]: You think the game's awesome?

2659
03:07:44,702 --> 03:07:46,683
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it kind of feels like a classic Sonic game.

2660
03:07:46,743 --> 03:07:51,506
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it still has elements from the recent ones, like the whole homing attack thing.

2661
03:07:52,881 --> 03:08:06,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could do without it, but it just, you're right, some may say it's not fluid enough because it doesn't, it's not, it's not like the old-fashioned Sonic where the screen would just like literally breeze by every time he just like, every time he literally moves.

2662
03:08:07,144 --> 03:08:13,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you're gonna have some hate from those classic fans, and I'm one of them because I grew up on that.

2663
03:08:15,072 --> 03:08:15,873
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2664
03:08:35,968 --> 03:08:43,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't played that game yet since I don't own a Wii or a DS, but from what I've seen, it's probably the same gameplay.

2665
03:08:43,674 --> 03:08:46,056
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly platform now, from what I hear.

2666
03:08:46,236 --> 03:08:47,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 2D platform.

2667
03:08:49,381 --> 03:08:52,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Sonic Colors is where it's at right now in the Sonic universe.

2668
03:09:06,416 --> 03:09:09,579
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have bought one when it was $100 a GameStop over Black Friday.

2669
03:09:09,859 --> 03:09:11,581
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know when they might do the next price cut.

2670
03:09:12,401 --> 03:09:14,543
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they'll get that low, but then again, the PS2 didn't.

2671
03:09:14,563 --> 03:09:16,124
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I mean, it was for used systems.

2672
03:09:16,865 --> 03:09:18,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I picked up a used 360 for $100.

2673
03:09:21,869 --> 03:09:24,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Legend of Zaku?

2674
03:09:25,271 --> 03:09:30,853
[SPEAKER_00]: DDRX2 is going to... Well, they're taking orders for it's supposed to ship out in two weeks.

2675
03:09:31,913 --> 03:09:38,435
[SPEAKER_00]: So, every... It's just... So far, it's shaping up to be pretty solid at this point.

2676
03:09:39,176 --> 03:09:46,178
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, fears about, like, drifting arrows and what the community was saying about, like, being off sync.

2677
03:09:46,538 --> 03:09:47,959
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to get quelled every...

2678
03:09:49,531 --> 03:10:02,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that Konami has already taken folks from Bomani Style and already proven to them that the final build of the game will be rock solid and something that the hardcores will definitely start playing.

2679
03:10:02,900 --> 03:10:08,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming the arcades shell out $10,000 for a new machine, which is the only way you're going to get the new game.

2680
03:10:09,125 --> 03:10:11,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Or unless you already have X and you get the upgrades.

2681
03:10:12,159 --> 03:10:12,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2682
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:18,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, uh, by the way, you need to check out Home, because they have DDR machines in Home, but you don't really get to play DDR on them.

2683
03:10:18,906 --> 03:10:22,109
[SPEAKER_09]: But I giggled when I saw the X2 machines in the Konami Home space.

2684
03:10:22,910 --> 03:10:30,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I'm hopefully, you know, assuming I get my Christmas bonus this year, I will definitely shell out money on a PS3.

2685
03:10:31,358 --> 03:10:31,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2686
03:10:31,959 --> 03:10:34,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, buddy, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call.

2687
03:10:34,701 --> 03:10:35,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care.

2688
03:10:35,402 --> 03:10:35,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye!

2689
03:10:37,489 --> 03:10:38,909
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2690
03:10:38,949 --> 03:10:45,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but we kind of are running long a little bit tonight, and we still want to get to the afterbirth and all that good stuff.

2691
03:10:45,091 --> 03:10:50,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So email us your thoughts, mailbag at orangelandradio.com, or send us tweets, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2692
03:10:51,554 --> 03:10:54,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, we've got to wrap it up, put the nail in the coffin of the show.

2693
03:10:54,414 --> 03:10:55,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki?

2694
03:10:56,215 --> 03:10:56,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, real quick.

2695
03:10:57,396 --> 03:10:58,237
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of cool.

2696
03:10:58,837 --> 03:11:09,205
[SPEAKER_07]: From the same guy that did the Left 4 Dead demake, kind of making the pseudo NES version of Left 4 Dead, but it's a PC game.

2697
03:11:10,005 --> 03:11:12,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Pixel Force also did that too.

2698
03:11:12,427 --> 03:11:13,348
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Hero.

2699
03:11:13,448 --> 03:11:16,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they have an 8-bit DJ Hero game you can check out.

2700
03:11:17,591 --> 03:11:23,736
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a bunch of cool chiptune mashups, including the... This is kind of cool.

2701
03:11:24,176 --> 03:11:29,419
[SPEAKER_07]: The Ghostbusters theme and Huey Lewis and the news I Want a New Drug mixed together.

2702
03:11:30,240 --> 03:11:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear that.

2703
03:11:31,601 --> 03:11:38,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently they said that it got some of the background or whatever was sampled from the same song or something.

2704
03:11:39,266 --> 03:11:42,408
[SPEAKER_07]: But lots of cool stuff and you can check it out for free.

2705
03:11:43,608 --> 03:11:45,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see where you can download that.

2706
03:11:45,690 --> 03:11:47,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, ericruthgames.com

2707
03:11:49,164 --> 03:11:49,904
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX Live Rewards Program

2708
03:12:04,696 --> 03:12:10,699
[SPEAKER_07]: But you get some kickback Microsoft points for different things that you do.

2709
03:12:11,340 --> 03:12:17,483
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, renewing a one-month gold membership will give you 10 Microsoft points back.

2710
03:12:18,643 --> 03:12:19,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Three months, 30.

2711
03:12:20,204 --> 03:12:20,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And 12 months, 200.

2712
03:12:22,225 --> 03:12:25,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Purchase or renew an Xbox Live Gold Family Pack.

2713
03:12:25,447 --> 03:12:26,507
[SPEAKER_07]: That gives you 400.

2714
03:12:28,288 --> 03:12:32,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Purchase or renew the first Xbox Live Online Gold Membership, 100.

2715
03:12:33,431 --> 03:12:35,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Make your first purchase on Xbox Live another 100.

2716
03:12:36,792 --> 03:12:39,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Selected content is going to vary.

2717
03:12:40,092 --> 03:12:42,673
[SPEAKER_07]: If you activate and use Netflix on Xbox Live, you get 100.

2718
03:12:43,613 --> 03:12:46,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have surveys for 20 Microsoft points.

2719
03:12:47,674 --> 03:12:48,414
[SPEAKER_07]: So, neat.

2720
03:12:48,934 --> 03:12:50,914
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do surveys and get 20 Microsoft points?

2721
03:12:51,154 --> 03:12:51,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2722
03:12:52,314 --> 03:12:52,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2723
03:12:53,075 --> 03:12:54,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd take a lot of surveys before you can actually buy something.

2724
03:12:54,995 --> 03:12:55,415
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

2725
03:12:55,935 --> 03:12:58,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you could get Techno Kitten Adventure for four surveys.

2726
03:12:59,916 --> 03:13:00,396
[SPEAKER_09]: That is true.

2727
03:13:00,416 --> 03:13:00,596
Yeah.

2728
03:13:01,178 --> 03:13:01,438
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2729
03:13:02,979 --> 03:13:05,561
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2730

2735
03:13:21,312 --> 03:13:28,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell a friend or two about our program because we don't have all the advertising dollars and so forth behind our show.

2736
03:13:30,258 --> 03:13:32,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So just tell a friend or two.
