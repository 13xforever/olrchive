14224	23897	Tonight, December 12, 2010, a high-profile PlayStation 3 game gets a big delay, Australia debates a new video game rating, and more rumors leak about the PSP2.
31482	38667	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
38787	48895	For about three hours, give or take, every Sunday night we meet to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that stuff with you guys in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
49195	50196	My name is Rob Roberts.
50356	53578	I'll be joining you with my co-host Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
53919	54199	Hi.
54599	55119	How are you?
56200	56681	Productive.
56961	57581	Productive.
57661	58122	That's good.
58222	59923	Productive Jamie is happy Jamie, right?
60950	62851	Sort of.
63071	64352	I'm being paid for it, so.
64772	65273	Hey, money!
65293	66013	Yay, money!
66093	68915	Yeah, and I'm going into finals week, so.
70154	70854	Good times.
71135	71375	Yeah.
71555	71935	All right.
71955	73076	Well, good luck with all that crap.
73856	74477	It's algebra.
75277	75777	Say hello.
75877	76158	Okay.
76418	81561	If 2X plus 9 equals Y, and forget it.
81581	82181	All right.
82361	84543	I could actually rewrite that 5 million different ways now.
84643	85403	Solve for kitten.
87284	88565	The answer is Shermie.
89626	91547	Can't divide by kitten, unfortunately.
91767	92287	Hi, Loki.
92327	92628	How are you?
92688	95789	Tech Master Loki joins us here every week with his witty insight.
95830	96490	How are you, Loki?
97345	98866	Good, and you can't divide by kitten.
99907	100487	It's like zero.
100887	103109	You can't mix the kitten with anti-kitten!
104730	105951	Not unless kitten is radical.
107371	108852	Oh, it's going to be one of those shows tonight.
108872	110413	It's just not going to make any sense at all.
110613	111374	Also, say hello.
111394	112294	We have some guests.
113095	115596	It's like pluralists in studio tonight.
116037	117398	And I'm going to introduce them here.
117998	120499	Since he has the mic, I will say hello to Salacious Pop.
120740	121080	Hello.
121340	122020	Hi, how are you?
122201	122921	I'm great, how are you?
123141	125202	I am well, thanks for asking.
126363	132068	except for the fact that, you know, it's Sunday night and then once this whole schtick is over, it's back to the work week, you know.
132288	136271	Yeah, and you have to be at work at like 7, 7.30 for a while now up until the holidays.
136411	138112	Yeah, and I'm just not a morning person.
138152	144477	You know, I really like my job, don't get me wrong, but it's just one of those like, you know, oh, getting used to the new schedules is really messing with me.
144697	146939	But, you know, it is what it is, so.
147259	154365	Ranma says if you divide by cat, you get kitten, but technically if you multiply two cat equals kitten, six kitten.
155758	159459	I can't even understand any of this.
159859	160139	All right.
161039	162840	So also say hello in studio.
162860	164240	We have another guest joining us tonight.
164760	165540	RKDN42.
165621	167221	Hello, my friend.
167301	168541	How are you doing?
168661	169321	Long time no see.
169341	171862	I haven't seen you since, I don't think you've been here since the marathon episode.
172062	173482	Yep, that's the last time I was in.
173522	176063	Which funny enough, Salacious Pop was here for too.
176123	178964	It's almost like a marathon show reunion.
180064	181044	No marathons, please.
181104	181764	No marathons.
181785	183125	Who wants to stay up until 4 a.m.
183145	183505	tonight?
183605	184065	Woo!
185205	185905	Yay!
186106	189206	I don't have a podcast to edit after the show, so I can do it.
189506	190207	Let's go.
190467	191087	Let's do it.
191807	193227	It's like New Year's Rockin' Eve.
193707	194308	All right, anyhow.
195888	196368	Let's see.
196468	200169	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
200889	203390	Actdeft in our chat room starts us off with this classy comment.
203710	206190	Salacious Pop, the occasional fourth host of the show.
206550	208171	I wonder if he sleeps with one of the hosts.
209071	213635	Actually, I always refer to the chat room as the ever-present fourth guest on the show.
213695	218138	So I think, Actdeft, you're implying that the entire chat room is, in fact, sleeping with one of the hosts.
218618	220620	I think is what he's really trying to say.
220780	221781	Slumber party!
222041	224823	Whoever falls asleep first gets their underwear thrown in the freezer.
225754	231839	Follow your dreams and never let anyone tell you that you cannot sleep your way to the paragon of independent video game journalism.
232880	238224	You put on your little black dress and you work it and you will be where I am now.
239125	240026	Believe in your dreams.
240086	240306	Yes.
240727	245470	I have to share something right now before I forget about it and before we get to our gaming weeks.
245490	247212	It's not something I need antibiotics for, is it?
248052	255574	This gorgeous piece of journalism, which I will take a picture of and show the chat room in a moment, is the American River Review 2011 edition.
256334	257534	I've done design in this.
257974	259074	It's $25.
259694	260515	Go buy one!
260855	262915	Why would anyone not in this area want one?
263235	265556	Because this thing wins like Uber awards.
265636	267536	We have people in Sweden that listen to this show.
267556	271197	Why should a Swedish person buy some community college?
271277	272097	Oh, recipes!
272177	273357	Fantastic literature.
273757	274737	It's a best of edition.
275357	276238	Fantastic art.
276818	277238	Fashion.
278158	279339	Oh my god, fashion?
279499	289962	I bet all of our gaming guys that listen to this show and they're teens that are between games of Call of Duty and Halo Reach are like, oh my god, fashion?
290663	292183	Where do I buy?
292243	295184	Some of the art in here is definitely nerd influenced.
295944	297525	Is there any video game reviews in there?
298582	301283	No, but there's lots of talk of video games in some of the stories.
301503	301863	Okay.
302324	308006	So obviously people, some of the writers are definite geeks, but it is a worthy purchase.
308246	312428	I will find the ordering information and post it somewhere so everyone can see.
312928	314329	But I've worked on this one.
314449	322192	And also, if you send me the money to get it for you, I will autograph it and get other people to autograph it and send it back to you so you can have an autographed copy.
324028	325149	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
355185	375479	by awesome I mean amazing and it's really hard to take a picture of something black um I uh what nevermind what no that's inappropriate just don't take a picture of my penis then okay I went there I went there that was rumored to be a problem with the Kinect at one time
377230	382373	At any rate, I played a lot of Final Fantasy.
382813	384514	I played a lot of Star Trek Online.
385174	387075	They have completely redone Sector Space.
387135	388396	I was showing you guys the pictures.
389556	392258	Now you can actually turn off that little grid thing.
392318	394539	And when the grid is on, it's actually a lot less pronounced.
395059	397140	But then you can just fly around like you're in space.
397440	401462	And you have the little light trails as your ship moves, which people were complaining about.
401722	402963	Wait, light trails and grid?
404554	405796	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
420376	426622	When you approach systems, it used to be that it would look like a little glowing model of a system, like you had in science class.
427622	429984	Now, it's you approach stars.
430585	433187	And as you get closer, it actually looks like a sun.
434108	436530	And the planets pop up around it.
436970	439252	And it's like you're actually approaching the system.
440053	441934	And only other turkeys will get this.
442354	446238	When you go to the Badlands, or to Little Nebula, or something...
447058	451759	When you approach it, it actually looks like a haze off in the distance and then you're in there.
451879	461581	Then when you actually enter the system or the area, then you're fully... Rob's pulling up the freaking... Well, Aisha, I was going to say that we have a clip of the soundtrack for the new Star Trek expansion.
465622	465862	No.
466722	467763	As you're flying through space?
468183	468423	No?
468723	468963	No.
471724	473244	Dave... You can't touch a rainbow or...
475093	477715	It looks like they've retextured some of the planets.
477755	479376	They've retextured the characters.
480297	482698	They've updated some stuff.
483239	485260	Earth Starbase has a basement now.
485900	486941	Ooh, fucking basement.
489323	491464	I also finally decided to make an Orion Slave Girl.
492905	493926	Running around in a bikini.
495227	496047	It's fantastic.
496567	500170	Apparently you can modify the Gorn now like anyone wants to play a giant freaking lizard.
501027	501969	Okay, I have to share this.
502089	503231	It has something to do with it.
503371	508139	There's my favorite Star Trek episode reviewer on YouTube.
508179	509241	It's SFDebris.
509862	510483	He's funny.
510523	512867	It's the highly opinionated Star Trek reviews.
513889	514029	And...
516440	519902	He was talking about Cisco winning.
520162	522004	They did one for Trials and Tribulations for DS9.
522524	523885	And talking about Cisco winning.
523905	526467	He could have talked to Kirk about all this other stuff.
526807	530889	Instead, he wanted to hear about the one time he porched a giant lizard in the nose.
531670	533051	Punched, I should say, not porched.
533951	535392	I wonder what a porch punch is.
537494	538835	This guy's reviews are fantastic.
538855	540295	It was Barry Waddle on purpose.
541216	543518	Maybe because Dork Von Weenie was already taken.
544784	547885	Arn Darvin, you see, is actually a Klingon.
548026	548326	Hey!
548906	551507	This guy's really funny.
551807	558350	Of course, he also said that the Defiant should have been named Ben Sisko's motherfucking pimp slap... Pimp hand!
559511	560651	Pimp slap hand, that was it.
561592	563833	Ben Sisko's motherfucking left pimp slap hand.
564895	568196	Welcome to the Star Trek Humor Podcast.
568616	570977	We have some really funny jokes for you today.
571197	574137	I have a really good zinger about Klingons.
574438	575278	Stay tuned.
575298	576778	Is this NPR?
576818	577318	Where am I?
577378	577898	Oh my god.
577918	580479	Talk of the nation.
580539	581119	Oh my god.
581920	583600	If I can finish with my story.
586281	587141	But at any rate.
589546	591026	They've made lots of changes for the better.
591647	592767	Still pissed off at Dabo.
593387	594647	Hololita's still annoying.
596688	598348	And that's really about it.
599408	602669	They've done a bunch of other retexturing, but really they've closed off.
602929	612271	The one thing I'm looking forward to is trying out the Foundry, which is you can create your own missions and then have other people go and play them.
612291	614472	You can put them up for other people to download and play.
615172	639854	so the good thing about that is that while maybe you've gone through all the major missions and everything is oh yay but you can actually go through and play new content that other people have created and that's really neat on the Tribble server they've got this thing to create new content which I haven't gotten to work yet but I'm going to look into that too the Tribble server is the playtest server
640775	640895	Okay.
640915	641076	Okay.
667593	683404	the last issue that the free expansion that City of Heroes put out was issue 14 the mission architect creator where you could create your own campaigns and that was the last expansion that Cryptic worked on so it sounds like they're doing something similar for Star Trek
683877	684397	Yeah.
708735	709816	Look at my boobs.
710277	710797	Just saying.
710837	716204	You can get a succubus with a warlock character and she'll show people her boobs and use a move called seduce.
716365	716765	Just saying.
716885	718187	Remember, my offer still stands.
718227	720330	If people want to pay for me to play World of Warcraft, I will.
721391	721852	Well,
722192	724973	I thought that was going to go in a different direction there.
728194	730414	Apparently the chat room likes my NPR voice.
730654	733895	So one of these days I'm going to have to just do an Orange Lounge Radio in all NPR voice.
734415	737316	Or you could just go listen to that Techno Kitten Adventure interview.
737336	738577	Hello, this is Terry Gross.
738677	739837	Today we're going to talk about...
741277	742797	Hello, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
742837	747098	We have a hilarious interview coming up with Nick, the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure.
747138	749179	He'll be joining us to talk about his game.
749759	752960	And also, we'll be talking about USL Madness.
753200	753960	It's maddening.
754480	758001	And also, when Bob uses that voice, it sounds a lot like the Saturday Night Live sketch.
758461	761002	And then I expect to have Martha Stewart come out and make brownies.
762242	764744	Anyhow, Loki, how was your gaming week?
764784	765484	Please help.
766505	777032	My gaming week consisted of not much because, one, I didn't have internet, which is not really a big factor because I don't play online games at home.
777813	778793	At least not anymore.
780114	780294	And...
782546	782886	What else?
784107	785488	Basically, Grand Theft Auto at work.
787209	790471	Swords and Poker 2 on the iPod.
791112	797676	And I did try out Infinity Blade, which is all sorts of beautiful and actually plays pretty good.
797756	802079	So it's very neat what they can do on the iPod.
802460	804921	But yeah, that's pretty much it.
805582	806302	Didn't play a whole lot.
808163	808924	Let's go to our guests.
808944	810785	We'll see if our guests have anything exciting to share.
810825	811726	How about Salacious Pulp?
813372	815113	Only two games to talk about, really.
815173	815953	Maybe two and a half.
816533	818913	The half is Knights of the Crystals on Facebook.
819154	819974	Knights of the Clicky.
820634	822034	Knights of the Clicky, not really a game.
822894	825655	I gotta use all your action points.
827055	830216	You don't have to feed cows in it, so already it's good.
830236	832117	I forgot to spend my action points before coming to this show.
832197	832697	I'm pissed.
833517	833837	Damn it.
834618	834858	Oh well.
835358	840781	And if you buy the $50 worth of Square Enix points, that's the best value.
841041	843403	What a waste spending money on that game.
843723	846004	The items you get... Forget it.
847885	851067	Then Poker Night at the Inventory on Steam.
852388	852888	I've been...
854753	859336	Slowly unlocking, because I've definitely gotten better at the Texas Hold'em thing as I've been playing.
859776	863939	I've been unlocking the various tables and deck cards.
864899	866040	So it does have unlockables in it.
866100	872924	No new characters, but I have the Fruit Fucker card table and the Salmon Max.
872944	874285	Don't you mean the Fruit Friend?
874305	875086	Fruit Friend.
875366	878688	Fruit Friend card table and the Salmon Max deck of cards.
879288	880609	Is that what they're calling it in there?
880649	881470	Fruit Friend, yeah.
881490	881930	Okay.
882749	884031	Strong Bad Cracks Me Up the Most
904153	906575	I have to poke a little fun at it, come on.
907155	915160	For the longest time, we look like we're totally telltale biased, so I have to take an opportunity to poke this one where I can.
915300	926267	When the seg was on a couple weeks ago on the show, he was like, it's a very basic fan service game, don't expect it to be anything other than trying to take us down a couple notches on the hype.
926307	927067	That's true, that's true.
927287	927508	Yeah.
928488	948227	and then Cataclysm of course came out Monday night so I'm in deep home right now level no I'm about to start Oldham I'm level 83 haven't done any of the new level 1 content yet for any of the races I'm very much working on my main and you have a separate WoW podcast for all of that so that's all I'm going to say but it's out it's there
948530	950394	That's okay, I'm going to talk Cataclysm a little bit here.
950514	952298	Just because it's a huge, huge thing.
952478	955484	So it has to cross over a little bit.
955785	959372	Overall, I'm very amazed at how seamless the digital...
959966	960767	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
984324	984484	Yes.
984644	985084	Oh, alright.
985184	985445	Okay.
986185	986365	What?
986465	986805	Yes, ma'am.
986825	989467	When I get back from Washington, I'll play for a month.
989627	990427	That's the spirit!
991248	996390	Hey, there's actually email coming up about how you can do that for free, so we're gonna get to that later.
996971	1005235	I know you probably haven't peeked at the mailbag yet, but somebody who listens to the other show also listens to this one and sent a great tip, so we'll talk about that when we get to the mailbag.
1005855	1007356	First, though, we gotta finish off Gaming Weeks.
1007416	1013179	Arcadian42, I know you play a lot of... You have a pretty diverse lineup of games that you play, right?
1013741	1015143	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1035743	1037965	Yeah, and it's really a thumb killer too.
1038386	1040928	I got one of the new Xbox controllers.
1042309	1045932	I commented on it briefly that the D-pad's a little bit better.
1046413	1047734	I'm not sure if it's that much improved.
1047754	1050076	It might hurt your finger a little bit more than the original.
1050556	1051097	Interesting.
1051157	1052498	No, I forgot those had come out.
1052778	1053399	I knew they were on there.
1053419	1054800	I forgot that now's the season.
1055281	1055661	Interesting.
1055741	1059725	But it's nice having a better charge pack so that lasts longer than the older one.
1060706	1061987	Have you used that at all for Game Room?
1062167	1063808	I know you were big into Game Room for a little while.
1064529	1066110	I've barely gotten done into Game Room.
1067572	1069513	Have you heard about what's come out in Game Room?
1069994	1074898	Like, this week, I'm not even kidding, Twinbee and Datana Twinbee both hit Game Room this week.
1075299	1077040	And, like, Puyan.
1077340	1082045	All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Game Pack 12 was like, bam, bam, bam.
1082125	1083766	All these huge titles came out.
1083786	1085968	They're all Konami, but it's almost like...
1087109	1090490	Hey, why didn't you give us this shit like three months ago?
1090530	1091650	We might have paid more attention.
1091670	1097172	I think I downloaded those packs, but I haven't actually... Because they were taking a long time to download, so I went to some other game.
1098752	1106234	And the main game I've been playing this week is Resonance of Fate, which is a Trias game that Sega put out.
1106714	1107274	It's actually an RPG.
1107354	1108674	It's got an interesting battle system.
1108754	1109815	All the characters use guns.
1111395	1140445	and so they have different like they have like a machine gun and the other people have like guns and like thrown weapons like grenades so you level up by your weapon experience and basically you have to think strategically because you have to move around the board because when you move the enemies move and they charge up and everything and you have like the set number of like hero gauge or I can't remember where you can have your character run across the fields like the other side like most of the
1140825	1141205	DarkSakura.com
1169366	1170026	I missed this one.
1170927	1171667	It's a 360 game?
1172267	1172727	Yes, it is.
1172767	1174267	I've been looking for a new RPG to play on 360.
1174307	1176868	Yeah, and there's probably several things you'd like about it.
1177308	1177748	Huh.
1177768	1179649	Because the characters are interesting.
1179709	1188791	They run into a lot of oddball kind of characters that basically are going on different fetch quests and do this for me, go to this area and fetch me something.
1190132	1193333	And some are a bit crazy.
1193353	1194693	Yeah.
1196233	1224021	but basically it's like basically a series of vignettes and kind of that kind of thing for at least for now because the overarching overarching story you don't you don't really get to that until later and I haven't gone that far yet but let me see what because actually the system map is a little bit interesting because it's actually a hex map where you have to lay down these like you get like a like little things of hexes that you have to put down and and to get through the other areas and there's colors and everything like that
1225041	1227785	It's actually a fairly interesting game.
1227905	1233754	Also, you can also play dress-up with the characters because you can actually buy all these different sort of clothes.
1233894	1237258	It's just not a JRPG if there's not dress-up at some point.
1239376	1241038	I love the box for the new Xbox 360 controller.
1241098	1241158	Um...
1256813	1258094	Also, a question about Game Room.
1258134	1260216	Ranma says, didn't Sunset Riders drop too?
1260576	1263038	No, that's rumored that that is in the game pack.
1263058	1263899	I'll tell you what came out.
1264199	1265820	I pulled up the list while Arcadian was talking there.
1266361	1277930	Daytona Twinbee, Puyen, Thwocker, Amidar, Off the Wall, Twinbee, Blades of Steel, Pitfall 2, Trick Trap, and Vectron have all come out in the past three weeks.
1278451	1282414	Mainly I hadn't checked them out because they stopped updating their Facebook thing because of all the...
1282894	1285716	All the closures and stuff, so it kind of makes you forget to look.
1286276	1289338	There's one thing about the new controller that I didn't mention.
1290839	1297403	The analog sticks have this little lip in them, so it might kind of hurt your finger a little bit more than the old one.
1298164	1304888	Especially with Super Meatball, where you're jamming the controller left and right and up and down all the time, that can kind of bite into your finger a bit.
1305268	1308829	Arcadian, you're kind of known as being a quiet guy.
1309030	1315092	You're playing games, but usually you're quiet and you don't yell.
1315172	1317493	You're not obnoxious like I am in crowds.
1318313	1324956	But I have to ask, when you play Super Meat Boy, are you the type that just starts, fuck, I can't fucking believe I lost that level.
1325256	1325636	God damn.
1326056	1327577	and you throw the controller against the ground
1348991	1352552	So, like, every time it was like just getting killed by this guy over and over again.
1352712	1354013	So, I got really pissed.
1354853	1357054	That guy was making me swear like fucking crazy.
1357154	1357734	There you go.
1358314	1358974	Ah, there you go.
1359674	1360175	Did you hear that?
1360375	1360595	Yes.
1360875	1362915	Just thinking about it makes me fucking crazy.
1363335	1365376	Yeah, and the same thing with Kyle in the first game.
1365396	1366076	That guy was an ass.
1366957	1368097	Fucking annoying as hell.
1368397	1387209	Always the quiet ones, always is, alright But Super Meat Boy, oh damn, damn, oh well, shit And then go on and just do it again, because it's so fast, you don't really have to think about it, just do it again You have to ask Lasius Pop about when I play Super Meat Boy, it's pretty exciting In fact, he'll even egg me on, he'll be like, don't you want to play Super Meat Boy?
1387489	1394954	Oh Rob, you're so close to beating that one level, come on, you should play Super Meat Boy Come on, you'll have that level beat in five minutes, come on, it's like entertainment for him
1395814	1396895	Thanks for watching!
1415203	1415604	Alrighty.
1416904	1417465	Let's see.
1418466	1424970	Going back to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com SolarFlare says, I've been playing Resonance of Fate for PS3.
1425010	1427492	Makes me feel like I don't know how to play JRPGs anymore.
1428173	1430955	DungeonBuster says, Fate's battle mechanics take a little getting used to.
1431315	1436199	I stopped playing it for a week or so and had to hit up easy encounters all over again just to get back into the groove.
1437679	1447842	You know what other controller I guess had come out recently I really want to get is that Tron controller because the game came out and sadly I have missed the game although I hear it's not so great.
1447882	1450063	I guess the reviews are mixed at best.
1450883	1451863	But I'm still curious.
1452103	1456125	I liked what I played at E3 so reviewers don't always get it right either.
1457665	1459047	You're reading one man's opinion.
1459387	1460368	That's all it really is.
1460388	1461970	It's not a team of people reading it.
1462010	1464512	What if it's Metacritic where you're reading several people's opinions?
1464533	1465153	Oh, big deal.
1465213	1466114	It's a few people.
1466395	1468156	I mean, they're all over the board with stuff.
1469178	1471580	There were some people that thought Gran Turismo 5 was awesome.
1471640	1472481	Some that hated it.
1472561	1476746	There was... I'm trying to think of one that had really weird reviews on it.
1477467	1477587	Um...
1479588	1480189	What was it?
1482571	1487475	Might have been Epic Mickey, because there were some people that really loved Epic Mickey and people that hated it.
1488456	1490578	It's going to be like that for everything.
1491579	1496263	Now, see, this is the weird thing, is that Tron Evolution supposedly has a 58 on Metacritic right now.
1496303	1498625	This is based on six critics, but then I don't see critic reviews.
1499286	1502308	So that makes me think, okay, they haven't really...
1503109	1524037	Had that, so I don't know, whatever I guess the movie only has like a 50-something too, so But people are dumb I mean, they're like Movie critics you have to take with a grain of salt My expectations for the Tron movie are very low As long as it's pretty and at some point I hear end of line I'm gonna be fine, you know what I mean?
1525278	1532301	My expectations are set really low I can't fucking wait Six days, six more days I heard a Tron rumor
1533842	1536044	Something to do with... Is this OMG Spoilers?
1536244	1536424	No.
1537185	1547435	Something to do... I think this is how the story was read, but Disney is pulling the original Tron DVD from retailers because... It's already done.
1547855	1549376	It's been in the vault forever.
1549396	1550958	They're not going to release it until later.
1551158	1563102	Because I thought that the way that it looks on the box art where it says Tron, they don't want people to go, oh, this is that movie that's in theaters right now, so I'll just buy this when it's a completely different movie, I think.
1563262	1572066	What the big deal is is that there is a remastered one waiting to be released, and they're not going to release it until after the movie comes out.
1572666	1574406	You know a box set's coming.
1574587	1575907	You know a box set's going to happen.
1576007	1581730	because they actually got the original animator back to go in and do all the touch-up work himself.
1581750	1582411	Yeah, that reminds me.
1582531	1587113	I need to watch the original Tron this week again because it's been so long.
1587173	1588054	I barely remember it.
1588274	1589234	I have it.
1589735	1590695	And the Laserdiscs.
1590855	1591496	I was watching.
1591516	1596278	They had a really... It was on... I think... It might have been Gizmo...
1597739	1598460	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1617441	1618761	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1642409	1643930	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1662041	1687357	um you know obviously uh they've redone all the old content and i'm hearing the worgen and goblin experience is amazing but um you know i talked about on the other show for a little bit my experience just going back and leveling a gnome priest which is one of the new race class combos that you don't need cataclysm for and it was neat a neat upgrade a lot of the mechanics from wrath of the lich king you now find in the classic wow and i think that's what's pretty cool because it
1687717	1713824	Allows it to have more vehicle type quests and kind of zany things Like today I was in Oldham and I got a daily quest to do a whack-a-mole type of quest It's just kind of weird stuff and a lot of very meta things Like the whole plants versus zombies quest that they have now Or peace balloon versus ghouls, whatever There's a lot of silly things in it But the core game is still great And the end game, I haven't seen a lot of the 85 end game yet Because I'm only about 83 and a third now
1715004	1716325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1737899	1739401	Pretty much roll your way through any dungeon.
1739701	1743344	You really have to take a step back and go, oh, crap, this is all new content.
1743465	1744425	I'm not overgeared.
1744806	1745807	I have to think about this.
1746307	1750311	And, you know, as a healer, which I play in the game, they made heals very expensive.
1750812	1756017	So now you really have to think about, do I really need to top this person off or should I go back to focusing on the tank?
1756377	1758139	So lots of interesting little game mechanics like that.
1758159	1761202	But if you want to know more about that, I got the other show, so we'll talk more about that.
1762083	1765526	As far as other games that I played, there were some free games that came out on Xbox this week.
1765586	1767447	And one of them, I don't even remember the name of it.
1767487	1768568	Somebody in chat will jump in.
1769029	1771451	It was one person plays a driver.
1771531	1774253	You drive around the course and the other person can shoot the driver.
1775174	1775855	Doritos games?
1776095	1777296	Yeah, it's one of those Doritos games.
1777336	1778637	That sounds like an old arcade game.
1778657	1782480	Was it not the shoot?
1782580	1786484	It was like one person was the driver and the other person had the gun and it was a two person arcade game.
1787706	1790627	You are thinking about, like, I know what you're talking about.
1790787	1791447	Tango and Cash.
1791667	1792807	Tango and Cash, yeah.
1792827	1793508	Press HQ?
1794208	1795728	Or no, Lucky and Wild.
1795748	1796789	Lucky and Wild, that was it.
1796809	1797149	My mistake.
1798849	1799249	That's it.
1800289	1801790	No, I know what you're talking about, though.
1802030	1803430	That was neat looking.
1803930	1804511	It's stupid.
1805511	1806071	It's free.
1806391	1807651	Yeah, it's free, exactly.
1807812	1809632	It was better than Yaris.
1810472	1811933	It was better than Totem Ball.
1811953	1813813	Did you download the other one?
1814373	1815174	Avatar Crash Course?
1815214	1816694	I downloaded it, but I haven't played it yet.
1817114	1817515	I know, I know
1837214	1841858	I hope maybe for the next year's Dorito competition we will have the Golden Girls with Guns game.
1842019	1844040	That's just Grand Theft Auto with the Golden Girls.
1844080	1845001	That's all I really want to say.
1845021	1847103	And I'll have you know, Doritos are kind of orangish.
1847483	1847984	It works.
1849085	1851627	And the Golden Girls lived in Miami, so they were kind of orangish.
1851667	1852187	You know what?
1852568	1852768	What?
1852848	1853689	It just occurred to me.
1854730	1859774	Okay, imagine like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game or the X-Men game or the Simpsons, only with the Golden Girls.
1859894	1860715	I know, right?
1860735	1860815	Yeah.
1861515	1863756	Like, Sophia hits him with that giant purse.
1863976	1864296	Uh-huh.
1865156	1868037	And, like, Blanche has the slut attack.
1868157	1868437	Uh-huh.
1869137	1870957	And who is the Arthur?
1871257	1872778	Dorothy, which is sassy.
1873258	1874338	She has the bitch attack.
1874478	1874818	Mm-hmm.
1875498	1880079	And basically, I guess, Rose would just walk through the game clueless.
1880099	1881320	No, she has stories about St.
1881400	1881660	Olaf.
1882540	1883140	She has the St.
1883200	1883620	Olaf special.
1883660	1884960	She'd have a goat that would come out.
1885100	1885320	Yes.
1889364	1890625	I don't even think that's it either.
1890685	1891146	It's like...
1909289	1909849	Thank you, Doritos!
1931658	1932479	You know what I'm doing right now?
1932499	1934180	I'm actually clicking to my profile.
1934660	1935460	Harm's Way.
1935520	1936421	That was the name of the game.
1936761	1937301	Thank God.
1938382	1941803	Thank God for the Xbox.com tracking everything that you play.
1943084	1944465	Harm's Way was the name of the game.
1945345	1946666	Phew.
1946706	1947266	That's weird.
1947306	1948647	The chat didn't beat me to that.
1948867	1951548	Usually having the live chat room, some people jump in with a game.
1951908	1952749	Nobody knew that game.
1953649	1954790	I guess that should tell me right there.
1954810	1956251	That's because the chat room didn't care.
1956411	1956791	Clearly.
1957111	1959113	All right, let's housekeeping real quick.
1959554	1963097	If you want to follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1963137	1964238	We can always use some more fans there.
1964258	1965079	And of course, Twitter.
1965500	1966661	Ask us some questions on Twitter.
1966701	1968402	We'll get to those in the second half of our show tonight.
1968783	1971285	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1972006	1974689	Meanwhile, let's get into the news tonight.
1975349	1982254	Yes, of course, the ever-denied but absolutely coming PSP2.
1983095	1987218	More rumors about the capabilities of it, since we don't know too much about it yet.
1987538	1989080	There are people that are working with it.
1989120	1994584	They're saying that the graphics are comparable to early PlayStation 3 titles.
1995064	2013717	It says that the lower resolution screen will surely help minimize the quality gap between PlayStation 3 games and PSP 2 games, but they're saying that it should be rather easy to port PS3 games over to the PSP 2, which sounds pretty impressive, actually.
2013857	2017839	That sounds dang impressive, but there's got to be a difference in quality.
2017879	2020080	I don't think that thing's going to be Sport and Blu-ray or whatever.
2020100	2021720	Well, here's the thing, though.
2021981	2023941	The textures don't have to be as big.
2023961	2027063	They can save a lot because it's a smaller screen.
2027463	2031285	The resolution isn't going to be as big as the PlayStation 3.
2032425	2055545	and because of that they can do a lot of tricks kind of like for example how they can do a lot of tricks with like you know Infinity Blade to make it look nice on an iPad or an iPod because you know they do a bunch of texture tricks and stuff to make it look like it's actually a higher resolution than it is and actually kind of the same goes with even just the PSP now they have a lot of tricks to make things look better
2056085	2057687	So, I'm not too concerned about that.
2057727	2058588	I think it's going to be awesome.
2058808	2062232	And as long as they have two dual analog sticks, which is great.
2062953	2066717	Are we talking about having more synergy between the PSP and the PlayStation 3 with this?
2066777	2067778	Because when...
2069110	2070652	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2089813	2101835	Not only would you be able to do that with... I'm assuming that this will also be able to emulate PlayStation 1 games as well and possibly PlayStation 2 games later on down the line have downloadable for it.
2102796	2103956	I mean, that would be really cool.
2104136	2114158	And then with the remote play, yeah, you would be able to probably play these games to their full extent because you'll have the controls that are going to be mimicking the same thing.
2115595	2144018	whatever happened to I remember at E3 when this thing was first announced remember Ridge Racer and remember when they were using the PSP as like a rear view mirror did that functionality ever happen in a game like where the PSP was kind of your controller or your spin off device or whatever from the Playstation 3 like I don't remember that ever actually happening did that technology just not play out um maybe somebody in chat knows of the game I think they have had things for that but
2145498	2149979	Not necessarily Ruby Mirror Are we talking anything like actually really cool?
2149999	2154860	Are we talking like Buzz will allow you to use the PSP to buzz in?
2154920	2155560	You know what I mean?
2156461	2170284	I'm talking about something actually kind of different I don't remember Nothing really stands out How you could visit the Animal Crossing village on your Game Boy Advance When you played GameCube Animal Crossing Remember that?
2170404	2170784	Now that...
2171344	2171965	I remember that.
2171985	2172525	That was awesome.
2172545	2173126	I used to cheat.
2174647	2174907	Alright.
2176568	2185035	So, a comment from our chatroom at chat.orangeonstranger.com GameGuru in our chat says, I'd rather hear about the price points of the 3DS than the PSP2.
2185716	2188398	Any crazy idea what this might cost?
2190646	2192347	The PSP2 I'd be willing to bet $300.
2192648	2192908	Or $250.
2194049	2197733	I think $250 sounds... I don't know, it's hard to say.
2197813	2199275	Depends what they're trying to push on it.
2199335	2202418	I mean, I could see it maybe as high as $300.
2202518	2209906	Because if they're going to try to compare this, say, with an iPod or something of that nature...
2211087	2211748	Thanks for watching!
2221337	2228302	I would hope it'd be around like $200 at the very most, but I don't know, it's hard to say.
2230263	2234106	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, nothing like Pac-Man vs. on the GameCube.
2234266	2234506	No.
2234786	2241851	Yeah, because there was that whole Pac-Man game on the GameCube where you could use, what, the advances, I think, as the controllers for the ghosts or something?
2241891	2242072	No.
2242812	2246695	No, Pac-Man would use that because he could see the whole screen.
2247495	2248896	I don't remember, but it was something like that.
2250549	2256634	No, the ghosts would be on the TV because they would be split screen on the TV, I think.
2256775	2260478	And then Pac-Man would be on the Game Boy Advance because Pac-Man could see the whole screen.
2261118	2262960	Because the ghosts couldn't see where you were at.
2264722	2265022	Alright.
2266809	2269010	Because if it's on the TV, then people would screen hack.
2269270	2274494	And then BlackWolf continues to say it was just remote play where you could play the same game on your PSP on your PS3.
2275995	2279697	Sometimes, not every game even does that back and forth either.
2279717	2281078	It's mostly the PS1 classics.
2281098	2282779	And here's the funny thing about that too.
2283720	2290324	Thanks to the hackers and stuff, they found out that a lot of games that don't support remote play actually could support remote play, but they just don't.
2291585	2293947	They've hacked different games to support remote play.
2293967	2295648	Well, isn't it usually a button issue or something?
2296028	2296228	No.
2297908	2298609	That's kind of sad.
2299709	2299989	Alright.
2300449	2304970	Well, also, speaking of sad, let's talk about Final Fantasy XIV.
2305030	2309310	Because there's... Actually, this is kind of sad, actually.
2309430	2312271	But I think a lot of us said this needs to happen.
2312671	2313331	Here's the deal.
2313411	2318832	Final Fantasy XIV, obviously the PC version came out and it's been getting slammed back and forth.
2318852	2322013	And we were talking about people selling off their stock and all this other stuff.
2322373	2322853	Here's the thing.
2323693	2328856	The PlayStation 3 version of Final Fantasy XIV, it was announced this week that it is not coming out in March.
2329376	2332158	It will be coming out indefinitely.
2332218	2332978	Like, they don't know when.
2333158	2335580	They have now said this game has been delayed indefinitely.
2336380	2340422	And that is like one step short of saying just the whole damn thing is cancelled.
2341083	2343024	Which is very, very strange.
2343384	2343824	But here's...
2345445	2346266	Here's what they're saying about.
2346326	2355396	The CEO of Squeenix, Yoichi Wada, basically apologized for Final Fantasy XIV and said that the Final Fantasy XIV team is restructuring.
2355796	2357098	There will be new leadership.
2357538	2359840	Hiromichi Tanaka, the producer, out.
2360521	2363263	Naoki Yoshida in the new producer-director.
2363984	2366726	And a lot of the other positions are being restaffed.
2367486	2372730	They are, quote, working on a concrete plan outlining Final Fantasy XIV's new direction.
2373270	2378694	It almost sounds like they are just starting the damn thing over, which is crazy.
2378795	2380556	Like, have we ever had a game...
2381617	2382177	and DarkSakura.
2401858	2418521	here's the great thing you guys after Christmas or even maybe before those copies of Final Fantasy XIV are going to plummet in price and pretty soon for about $20 you'll be able to pick up the game and play for free online indefinitely granted you won't be playing a great game but it'll be cheap
2419322	2444102	so there you go so that's really interesting to me I think I had said on the show before that I think I even used the phrase heads will roll at Squeenix and this was around the time it was the episode wherever the news came up about the stock getting sold I said that this was an inevitable conclusion that this is really an embarrassment but I don't know if I necessarily blame the producer
2445120	2450422	who got canned over this as much as I blame whoever made them put this out at Christmas.
2450842	2452783	This game was a year away from release.
2453463	2457605	And all of that year, the engine is pretty much done that the game runs in.
2457645	2458786	The graphics look great.
2459106	2460046	The sound's fine.
2460346	2463848	The problem was all the game mechanics weren't implemented.
2464168	2466469	There's no fucking auction house in the game right now.
2466669	2467009	Hello?
2468598	2482997	that's the problem whatever executive or whatever decision made them put this game out this year that's who needs to be canned in my opinion because this game was a year away from being released in reality and so now it's back to the drawing board
2483698	2500002	Yeah, and it just seemed like with them releasing it in September, October of this year, a lot of people were saying, well, it's kind of a shit circus on PC, but they'll work out the bugs, and maybe it'll play a lot better with a controller in your hand, and it'll be decent on the PS3.
2500042	2509565	There'll be some bug fixes, maybe a little major patch that comes out, and now it just sounds like, okay, this game is so bad,
2509625	2517027	I bet that's exactly what happened and I think that it was this whole oh no we stand by our product we stand by our product thing and keep hoping and hoping until it said look this is your reality check bang bang
2539766	2550318	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says Rob, and don't forget the anti-addiction timer where they cut off your XP after so long I actually think a lot of that shit's been overblown because guess what?
2551024	2554767	Warcraft has something similar, but no one's talking about it.
2555207	2557429	World of Warcraft has something very similar.
2557449	2564374	The WoW forums are filled of bitter, sour tears of the crying, the anger.
2564654	2566095	It's the guild experience.
2566355	2569618	You can only gain a set amount of guild experience in a week.
2569718	2574481	And I'll tell you what, after this expansion was released, I hit my week cap in a day and a half.
2574902	2578785	And your guild together can only earn so much experience in a day.
2579665	2595010	and you get rewarded when you don't play for a while you get double experience so I think a lot of this stuff in 11 or I mean 14 excuse me was kind of overblown because it was what you could play like your character for like 20 hours in a week before you started hitting penalties
2595390	2598452	My understanding with XIV is that it was the job system.
2598912	2604054	I don't know exactly what the names of the jobs were, but you couldn't min-max, I don't know, like leatherworking or whatever.
2604114	2608637	You had to trade your job out for something else and then level that up.
2609277	2619582	So they just wanted, it wasn't necessarily a OCD, please take a shower and go to bed type thing, but just, you know, it wasn't one of those.
2619622	2623264	It was just more, you know, we don't want you to min-max one thing.
2623284	2624545	We want your character to be diverse.
2625465	2651389	diversify, diversify Ziba in our chatroom I think sums it up very bluntly with this one comment no chocobos either no mounts, gotta walk everywhere it's not so much that but it's a Final Fantasy game with no chocobos that's like that's like a Michael Bay movie with no explosion that's an Anne Hathaway movie with no nude scene what is this?
2653223	2654003	I don't understand.
2655784	2659786	TigerClaw on our chatroom says, so Square Enix just pulled an NBA Elite and starting over.
2660106	2664548	Kinda, except they did it about three months too late did they pull the game off shelves.
2664608	2666850	Although they haven't really pulled the game off shelves either.
2667150	2670851	It's just the copies on shelves currently are gathering a lot of dust.
2673133	2673893	We'll see what happens.
2675876	2688539	Also, kind of along the same lines, not only is there news about Final Fantasy XIV, but if you're kind of fed up with the current state of XIV, maybe you should go back to Final Fantasy XI, because there's a new expansion coming out in December.
2689619	2694900	I don't think it's actually an official expansion, it's just one of those Uber patches that's going to really change the game.
2695660	2704342	The level cap will be going up from 85 to 90, and there will be a lot of new spells and abilities, some new powers for blue mages, because they get monster abilities and so forth.
2704942	2721436	Yeah, and expansions I know are still coming out for this game They're not retail expansions, they're download expansions But this game's still trotting right along And with some of the screenshots you see that they pick You would think that this game is a newer game They really are able to still sell this with some pretty screenshots
2721776	2731203	And I believe Steam, whenever they have one of their sales, which is all the time, they have a Final Fantasy XI plus the XIII various expansions that have come out for it.
2731483	2732363	It's dirt cheap.
2732403	2733124	For like $5, $9.
2733304	2735285	And I think it has a month that comes with it.
2735365	2740209	So yeah, if XIV's that bad, check out the hella pack on Steam for XI.
2740309	2744572	Yeah, XI's still cooking and it's doing pretty well.
2744972	2746873	You know what XI needs most of all, though?
2747414	2748955	To lose PS2 support.
2749324	2751646	So they could, like, update the engine, you know what I mean?
2751767	2751987	Yeah.
2752227	2758974	But at the same time, a lot of people with, like, lower-end laptops and things of that sort are able to run Eleven, you know, because it is a PS2 game.
2759354	2762818	And I'm sure there's PS2 Final Fantasy XI players that are like, shut your mouth, Rob.
2763358	2763759	And, you know...
2765290	2770333	To bring up City of Heroes for the umpteenth time, they just had a graphics update for Going Rogue.
2770413	2773395	It's an MMO that came out in 2004.
2774196	2777518	There are people that are on computers from 2004 that are still running fine.
2777958	2783782	You can't update the graphics too much because you're going to lose your subscriber base that's been with you for six years.
2785523	2788584	Even if it was on a PC platform, you still have that limitation of...
2789585	2790385	We've released the suck patch!
2815732	2816873	Yeah.
2817054	2817334	Okay.
2818155	2818956	We're going to redo it.
2819536	2826444	And so now I'm like, okay, now maybe I can get excited about this game because now they're going to put the year of time that it needed the first time into it.
2827694	2834436	I miss the flawless, godlike square where even their crap games smelled of vanilla and sang hosannas.
2835316	2839318	And now they've made an actual shitbag of a game.
2839558	2842358	I know, look at all the people that still love Final Fantasy VIII to this day.
2842879	2844039	And like, what a shitty game that was.
2844059	2847620	Yeah, during the PS1 era, everything, and then Saga Frontier.
2847780	2853582	I'm just ruffling feathers, because I know there's listeners out there that are like, you shut your mouth, Squall and Zell are awesome, and Laguna, oh my god.
2854122	2864474	Yeah, the PS1 era, you know, Saga Frontier, bad, Einhander, good, and just Square could do no wrong, Final Fantasy VII, and now it's like, this is what you've become.
2865255	2866036	Look at yourself.
2866096	2867517	Look at your life, look at your choices.
2867958	2868178	Yeah.
2869419	2876605	SolarFlare in our chatroom says, now XIV is so bad they are taking the guys from XI that made XI good and put them on XIV.
2877066	2877506	Great!
2877866	2883391	Because some of the changes that XI got five years too late made that game great.
2883911	2889236	The whole level sinking, that's something that should have been put into the game about a year after its release, not five.
2889256	2892839	Because you played XI for about three years and it still had a lot of problems, but you stayed with it.
2892879	2894100	I finally got sick of it.
2894761	2895721	Honestly, after playing WoW...
2897142	2898383	I couldn't take 11 anymore.
2899524	2900184	I played 11.
2901225	2901885	For like a week.
2902245	2903586	No, I played longer than that.
2903666	2903946	You did.
2903986	2905607	You were like a couple months.
2906047	2909029	I was the queen of doing all that crap on my controller too.
2909770	2918094	I had all my macros set up on my trigger buttons and it was just that one experience that finally was the straw and I'm like, all of you people suck!
2918835	2920676	And I left off in a big stomping diva huff.
2921092	2926400	So what Solar Flare is saying, to hear that the guys that made 11 good are now going to go make 14 good?
2928308	2931570	WAKE ME UP WHEN A RELEASE DATE IS OFFICIAL FOR THE PS3 VERSION
2954144	2954364	DarkSakura
2967952	2972314	Well, this is one of those warm fuzzies, and I really mean warm and fuzzy.
2973915	2976396	The charity Child's Play, we know of Child's Play, don't we?
2976836	2977176	Of course.
2977836	2980677	They have capped the 11 million mark.
2980737	2981498	Not 11 million mark.
2981518	2985119	When I say 1 million mark, it'd be nice if they capped the 11 million mark, wouldn't it?
2985800	2988901	We just got done talking about Final Fantasy XI, so, you know.
2989401	2990602	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3012583	3018547	Really is disappointing, but that's what happens when you live 100 miles away from where the fun's at.
3018727	3022890	I wanted to go, but I had my algebra final.
3023190	3025291	I hear it went really well, though.
3026272	3028934	I'm hearing it was better than last year, which last year I had a lot of fun.
3029034	3031816	So I'm really happy to hear it.
3032416	3040640	and, of course, hearing about all this money that was made just collectively amongst all the efforts of not just even the big stuff, but the little stuff, too.
3041001	3041501	That's great.
3042021	3055048	And, you know, it's unfortunate that CNN won't report this, but they'll talk about the Xbox gamer that beat up a special needs child for his Xbox, which, yes, was a story on this show about six months ago, I think.
3055128	3056808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3078254	3081376	I think that they're still looking to reach that by the end of the year.
3081536	3086459	That would be great if they could top what they did last year considering the state of the world and the economy and all that.
3086479	3088080	That's a very aggressive goal.
3088120	3094443	But I think just taking all that into consideration, I think it's great that they've made it as far as they have.
3094644	3095084	I agree.
3095364	3096284	I definitely agree.
3096344	3097285	I'm very pleased.
3097785	3098666	So, there you go.
3099947	3101467	Alright, moving on.
3101768	3102128	Loki.
3103649	3104389	Yeah.
3105210	3106030	I don't know the thing of this.
3106110	3107431	It's kind of ridiculous, but
3108900	3117271	They have added quests now on the PlayStation Network for the rewards program.
3118510	3122472	And these quests are basically to get you to test out different things.
3123512	3127214	For example, they have one of the quests that you can do.
3127494	3129695	Kind of think of it as achievements.
3130776	3136338	Check your pulse, which requires you to watch an episode of Pulse on the PlayStation Network.
3137599	3143422	Or to play a PlayStation Move game, and you get the Move It quest.
3144782	3150148	or the No Place Like Home quest, which involves you visiting the Central Plaza and PlayStation Home.
3150469	3156335	So will I get, like, if I successfully complete a quest, will my PlayStation 3 go, it's dangerous to go alone.
3156395	3163083	Here, take this and, like, give me candy or maybe a letter to take to the old woman so that she'll sell me, you know, drinks?
3164584	3165886	Well, I don't know.
3165986	3166006	I...
3168678	3179046	I just had to laugh when I saw this because it's like, you know, I can see one of the quests being, find a purpose, go visit home, because there is no purpose.
3180988	3187673	Really, you know, it's, what was it, salt, it's really awesome, or sodium one, I'm sorry, yeah.
3189077	3199407	It just sounds like that Home is so useless that they've added a layer of meta gaming on top of it just so that you logged on, you sat down, just, I don't know.
3201291	3202672	Don't get dry-hopped by a furry.
3202692	3203732	You dance with a furry.
3204012	3204773	Exactly.
3205773	3206074	Damn.
3207494	3211216	DarkTetsuya says, So when will OLR start giving out quests?
3211376	3212457	Okay.
3213257	3217519	Go leave a five-star review for the show on iTunes and you get a sticker.
3218740	3224223	Go tell something nice about OLR to a friend of yours and get a high five.
3225924	3228725	Get Permaban by DarkSakura Feat of Strength.
3228825	3229706	You can only do it once.
3231826	3232246	No, no, no.
3232767	3234308	We don't want them to achieve that.
3234348	3235788	You don't want somebody to achieve that.
3237490	3239891	I don't know that anyone's ever pissed me off to get permabanned.
3240071	3241092	Yes, they have.
3241752	3242373	I know they have.
3243293	3245314	One person I permabanned.
3246275	3247035	I think there might be two.
3248476	3250017	The other person, I didn't permaband them.
3250217	3251959	I just kicked them out the chat room.
3251979	3252459	Well, whatever.
3252559	3254020	Anyway, our point is...
3256335	3257556	So what is the reward?
3258137	3264763	Is the reward just a virtual trophy-style thing, or do I actually get, I don't know, like a discount on a game, or a...
3266437	3267919	I don't know, a certificate in the mail?
3268539	3270281	A spot on the cast of Tester 3?
3270361	3270601	What?
3271122	3278509	Well, what the PlayStation rewards are is you get free PlayStation Network bonuses.
3279029	3282473	And apparently they're for fans.
3282553	3285335	They didn't really say, I don't think, what the bonuses were.
3285376	3285736	It says...
3291101	3292322	The reward's free.
3292482	3295304	It says it'll be open to the PlayStation owners regardless of the plus status.
3297166	3300569	Think of it like Club Nintendo or Square Enix members.
3300969	3305332	PlayStation Rewards is tiered, separating its members into three groups, Select, Pro, and Legendary.
3305753	3310737	Playing games, downloading demos, using PlayStation Home, being active on the PlayStation.com forums.
3311217	3318683	And then I guess at the end of the year or something they'll say, okay, this tier gets this, this tier gets that, this tier gets this, and be done with it.
3319649	3321330	Death Wishings wants to know, how do you sign up?
3323611	3327792	I believe you do with... I want to say they have their own dedicated website to that.
3329213	3331214	Let's take a look here.
3331574	3337416	Meanwhile, while you're looking for that, Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, I think you would get a permaban if you left a one-star review, so don't.
3338216	3342578	No, you wouldn't get a permaban, but I'm going to bring Shermie over to your house and start talking about the tester.
3343138	3343738	That's what I'll do.
3343758	3343798	Uh...
3347968	3351530	Xlink in our chatroom hypothesizes that you get a signed autograph of Kevin Butler.
3352470	3353811	There you go.
3353991	3354751	I'm not sure.
3354951	3358813	It doesn't really say what it is because I don't think it's fully launched yet.
3358913	3360094	It's still in beta.
3360614	3365436	So right now you have to, they say you have to be a highly engaged.
3365476	3366557	Probably a PlayStation Plus member.
3367197	3370278	Well, I don't know if it's PlayStation Plus.
3370318	3373580	It says you have to be a highly engaged PlayStation owner.
3373760	3377421	Meaning you gotta be posting on their forums and playing home.
3377501	3380542	It says basically they offer similar features as PlayStation Plus.
3380902	3385324	It says the only difference I guess is reward is free.
3385464	3385844	I don't know.
3385984	3391465	It's just a gimmick to get you to try all the stuff that they have out there like renting videos and stuff like that.
3391505	3392586	They want you to try that.
3393146	3393486	No thanks.
3393746	3396787	You know, Steam has something similar-ish going on right now.
3396827	3402188	It's not quite as, you know, bold as, you know, trying to get you to go into home and all that stuff.
3402208	3411071	But they have, like, these quest thing going on right now where you play certain games and once you get, like, actual achievements, like, I think one of them was for the game Droplets.
3411091	3414272	You had to get a certain amount of points and that was, like, one of four options.
3414612	3418993	But one of the other options was sign up for an official games fan club.
3419073	3422774	So one of them was something you didn't have to actually own in a game to do and then, like, other ones would be
3423654	3446739	and I think what they do like they draw a name it's a scavenger hunt yeah that's what it was like a scavenger hunt and then like they draw a name from all the people who have submitted badges and you get like what is it like a hundred free games or something shit crazy that they do on Steam with their sales so it's this sounds similar except for the fact that Steam I know what I'll get like if I do enough of these I get free games yay
3448326	3448686	There you go.
3450987	3452948	Other stuff going on on other consoles.
3452968	3453468	How about the Wii?
3453488	3454808	We haven't had a lot of Wii news tonight.
3454988	3457869	And the Udraw game tablet came out not that long ago.
3458490	3461191	And we were kind of wondering if it was going to be a hit or a miss.
3461231	3463011	It sounds like it might actually have been a hit.
3463391	3466713	THQ has said that they are going to continue to support the Udraw Wii through 2012.
3468293	3478596	The chief financial officer, Paul Pacino, started to kind of give us some specifics as to what that was going to include at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference.
3478996	3484618	He said that four to five titles will arrive from THQ in the next fiscal year, meaning April to April.
3484758	3486299	So April 11 to March 2012.
3488379	3494381	However, you don't know exactly what games are coming out, except there will be a SpongeBob SquarePants game.
3495041	3495682	There you go.
3495982	3496042	Woo!
3499659	3528290	so there it is otherwise as far as the other games go we don't know yet stop asking if it's Mario Paint just stop we want to see it happen too but seriously we haven't heard anything like that yet so just let it go let it go oh Mario Paint but it better have the music mode in it that was awesome-tastic well how about something different how about Kinect sound like fun
3528860	3529160	Sure.
3530181	3531321	I haven't touched mine in a week.
3532642	3540446	Well, the tech firm that made the camera sensor actually released open source drivers for the Kinect.
3541466	3545969	And that way means that basically you can do pretty much whatever you want with it.
3546469	3549090	It's developed, put out.
3550571	3556194	I think they said that the Prime Sense, which is the company that did it.
3556234	3556854	They're Israeli.
3556874	3557494	That's really cool.
3558075	3558295	Anyway.
3559596	3561977	has set up all kinds of stuff out there for it.
3562137	3562938	So that'd be pretty cool.
3563318	3565059	It's the OpenNI framework.
3565920	3575947	It has an API for writing NI apps and offers middleware that allows RGBD sensors like the Kinect and lets you use it.
3576747	3579509	So these Kinect hack stories are kind of a dime a dozen now.
3579549	3582771	I mean, you know, everybody's hacked their Kinect 10 ways from Sunday.
3583211	3585392	I'm kind of curious what this means.
3585432	3587294	Like, okay, so there's an open source Kinect driver.
3587334	3587854	That's cool.
3587914	3592036	So indie game developers could use this sort of thing.
3592096	3594898	But this doesn't mean anything official can happen, right?
3594998	3602243	Because an official company would not be able to use an open source Kinect driver and expect to have their game embraced by Microsoft, right?
3602263	3604644	Microsoft already said they were excited about this.
3604884	3608005	to see what modders would be able to do as long as they stayed within the law.
3608586	3610026	Okay, that's interesting.
3611267	3622611	Then, with that coming to mind, do you think there's the possibility we could see an actual big game publisher try to do something with Kinect on the PC?
3623352	3628634	Maybe, but I'm more thinking that they're leaving it open for the indie type stuff.
3629374	3630735	There's other stuff happening on PC.
3631539	3638682	I'm also kind of surprised though that with Kinect being like that must-have holiday toy, that they're not letting it embrace the PC side a little more.
3638702	3639422	I mean, I get it.
3639522	3642883	They're not doing that because they want to sell more Xboxes.
3643023	3644124	That's what's going on.
3644564	3646565	But I'm still kind of surprised they're not...
3648926	3664516	Outside of this one comment, it's not being a little more embraced because imagine if, you know, the people at whatever sales store like GameStop or whatever could more openly advertise, hey, this device, it runs on your 360 and your PC.
3664956	3667998	You can play Biggest Loser with Jillian Michaels on your PC.
3668118	3668298	Woo!
3668318	3668378	Woo!
3670012	3684321	My thought is that Microsoft is actually going to have some sort of cross-promotion going on between PC side and do something that's already optimized for PC, or at least quote optimized for PC, so that they can get more sales out of it.
3684381	3689564	But then again, my other thought too is that if they were going to do that, then the holiday season would have been the time.
3691565	3695047	Maybe next holiday, because I think this holiday they want to sell Xboxes.
3695458	3698921	Gaming on PC, in their eyes, I don't think is very huge.
3699921	3706206	People do it, but it's not like, you know... It's not like you have PCs in your living room.
3706246	3710029	But don't they keep trying with the games for Windows relaunches?
3710049	3711810	Yeah, but that's different, though.
3712031	3714993	People have laptops, and people game on laptops...
3715513	3715954	DarkSakura.com
3737975	3739936	I don't think that they're really going to have this.
3740536	3752800	They may have similar technology down the line or something that may be built into something like an all-in-one PC or like a laptop or something where you can do different gestures to navigate around crap.
3753260	3757722	Maybe like a new Windows Media Center or something like that.
3757882	3763204	But I don't think they're going to actually try to push the Kinect for a PC market.
3763886	3769773	Unless they did have something sort of like you were saying for one of those, because you know Vista has all this ease of access stuff built in.
3770674	3783489	I mean, they could technically have, well, they'd already created, I'm not saying that Microsoft did this, but there was already a device that technically read brain patterns so that someone could think type.
3785130	3785630	You know what I mean?
3786711	3790853	And yeah, it took them two minutes to write an entire sentence.
3791653	3800497	But if they had the Kinect technology set up, for say that you've got a quadriplegic, they can maybe move their head.
3801778	3803919	That would be the perfect type of accessibility.
3803979	3808821	It'd open up a universe to people who didn't have that opportunity before.
3809441	3815446	And that's another reason why I'm actually glad to see I like to see those types of things come out And not just, you know, ghetto little hacks
3818247	3823190	Um, let's see, I'm going to the, uh, uh, chat room at chat.orange.com.
3823210	3828693	Game Guru says, I'm still trying to find an Xbox 360 controller for the PC and not resort to a cord.
3829273	3831394	Um, it's difficult to do, but you can do it.
3831474	3835136	It's called an Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver.
3835716	3836837	Uh, you can buy these.
3837177	3839658	It's a little dongle for your PC.
3840259	3843720	And it doesn't just work with the, um, uh...
3844781	3845721	Thanks for watching!
3864489	3866491	Is there like a little barcode on the back of this or anything?
3866831	3870935	No, it's called the Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows.
3871176	3874039	Would you take a picture of that and put it on our lovely OrangeLaunchRadio.com blog?
3874459	3878103	They work good for wireless controllers, which I use in my laptop.
3878323	3879805	Yep, so that's what you need.
3880886	3882367	I'm looking at Frugal right now.
3882407	3885310	They're about $20 on various websites, so take a peek.
3886031	3886431	DarkSakura.com
3916363	3917103	Wow, that's it?
3917663	3918323	That is it.
3940848	3942789	DECA Sports Freedom Call of Duty Black Ops Dubbed Edition
3956676	3957196	All of those guys.
3957216	3958557	This is actually a pretty big week in Japan.
3959297	3961218	On the PlayStation 3, many of those same games.
3961298	3964440	Call of Duty Dubbed, Castlevania Lords of Shadow, Gundam Musou.
3964980	3971963	There actually is a PlayStation console bundle coming out with Lords of Shadow this week as well because they love bundles over there.
3972543	3975344	Sports Champions for the Move comes out this week as well.
3975765	3984949	And one other game, Umeniko no Naku Koro ni Majo 2-3 no Rinbu Kyoku comes out this week.
3985649	3987430	I have no idea what this is.
3987830	3990271	Although one of the screenshots, hecka looks like Phoenix Wright.
3991271	3993332	It says it's like the PC version.
3993372	3996193	I guess this is an adapter or an adaption of the PC version.
3996713	3998554	It's an adventure novel adaptation.
4000155	4001475	But that does not look like Phoenix Wright.
4001575	4002035	Objection.
4003396	4003876	Oh, yuck.
4003916	4005657	There's a girl who got stabbed with something.
4006157	4008458	This does kind of seem like a crime type game or something.
4009795	4012517	Maybe it's a different company's answer to Phoenix Wright.
4012577	4013018	I don't know.
4013618	4013878	Maybe.
4014119	4014439	Maybe.
4014519	4016360	Moving on to other consoles on the Nintendo Wii.
4016841	4022625	Monopoly Here and Now, the World Edition, because I know you're all looking forward to that, gets a price reduction this week.
4022746	4026549	Pac-Man Party comes out this week, as well as Shape Boxing 2.
4027349	4027970	Wii Day.
4028130	4028891	Enjoy Diet!
4030438	4031779	That's really the name, you guys.
4032279	4032780	Really the name.
4033780	4038683	Going on to the PSP, Shining Hearts this week from Sega is the big release on the PSP.
4039064	4044107	Otherwise, a variety of games are getting a price reduction, like Suigetsu Portable and so forth.
4044827	4045228	There it is.
4045928	4047189	Your Japanese releases.
4047881	4050982	Well, for our friends in the UK, I've just got three things.
4051803	4054344	Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves on PS3.
4055484	4056224	That's on the 15th.
4056344	4058305	On the 16th, World of Goo for iPad.
4058805	4067228	And on the 18th, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam, which is a whole whopping three days before the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 release.
4068149	4068529	That's it.
4069349	4070470	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
4088588	4105431	Where DarkSakura is going to pull a game from the archives And I will say, she did go way back in the archives this week And it's a game that even I remember And I used to like too I'll tell you this much, it's a Sega game Surprise But it's one that I remember We'll get to that in a minute Loki
4106312	4123998	well there's still more progress going on in Australia to approve a new rating for video games to allow adult themed video games to be released in Australia I had already passed the federal cabinet and they've approved that
4124438	4125739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4148812	4161663	and basically right now they haven't really come to a conclusion whether they're going to pass it or not but I mean it's the federal cabinet thinks it's okay and gamers think it's okay so we'll just have to see it's a matter of time
4163499	4189510	I think they should I mean hell if anything you know Australia always seems to have like the cliche you know manly men and you know they're tough and the thunder from down under is that what you're talking about or not like not necessarily that but I don't know it just seems kind of Rob that's a dish it out back Astro Purview which I think is what he was referring to
4189727	4194411	But isn't Australia also the country that bans a lot of games outright?
4194511	4197634	Yeah, because they didn't have this.
4197914	4202118	If this goes into place, they will have a way to classify those games.
4203177	4206559	SolarFlare in our chatroom says, Oh, I heard about this on Zero Punctuation.
4206639	4208000	Guy made a big fuss about it.
4208040	4209241	Doesn't he make a big fuss about everything?
4209781	4210762	I thought that was kind of a joke.
4211122	4212303	Yeah, that's what I thought.
4213324	4215405	All right, moving on to another story.
4215465	4218727	This has to do with the VGAs, of course, who were last night.
4219548	4221569	The Video Game Awards on Spike TV.
4221870	4223250	Eh, you know what?
4224211	4224791	I'm over it.
4224992	4229535	Like, I don't really watch it because I know all the news is going to hit the internet five minutes later, which is exactly what happened.
4229555	4231696	I honestly thought they were today, but whatever.
4231836	4232156	Whoops.
4233318	4236505	I want to see it just because Neil Patrick Harris is going to be hosting it, and he's awesome.
4236646	4239132	How can they make the VGAs more tolerable?
4239954	4240956	More Neil Patrick Harris?
4242044	4242584	That's true.
4242664	4245425	But also, I think they should just stop trying to make it cool.
4246265	4251887	Because when people who don't... There's so many people, I think, that try to make the VGAs cool.
4252307	4254488	Like, this is cool, you guys.
4254508	4258049	We're going to do this really cool segment of a dick and fart joke.
4258089	4259009	It's going to be really funny.
4259069	4261570	You don't know anything about video games.
4261590	4264351	They're just trying to make it like the MTV Movie Awards.
4264671	4265611	And you know what's sad?
4265932	4267272	They do a better job than G4 does.
4267572	4268653	Best Episodes of Cheaters!
4291352	4298914	Alright, well, there were some pretty big stories that came out of the VGAs, even though, you know, most of it was, like, just little teases.
4299414	4302095	Just little teases, like, I know something you don't know.
4302515	4307597	But one of the big trailers, of course, was Elder Scrolls V, Skyrim.
4308677	4313498	Not a damn piece of gameplay in the trailer, just some dragon waking up and, you know, narration.
4314219	4315839	But that was enough for me to go, what?
4317239	4319200	Was the dragon waking up and narration going...
4319440	4320781	Girl, I'm a dragon.
4321061	4321902	I'm waking up.
4322082	4324763	Time for another Elder Scrolls game.
4324783	4325304	That's right.
4326024	4326604	Oh, yeah.
4327265	4329806	That's exactly actually what it sounded like.
4329866	4330547	No, here, I'll play.
4331187	4333068	I happen to have a link to the trailer right here.
4333148	4334689	Let me see if I can play a little bit for you.
4334709	4335930	I'm a dragon, y'all.
4336230	4337431	I'm waking up.
4338211	4339272	How's it going?
4339292	4339992	Nothing like that.
4340032	4340553	Stop it.
4340573	4341733	New Elder Scrolls.
4341954	4342434	Yeah.
4343953	4344333	Hold on.
4344614	4349439	I'm trying to play some of the trailer here and the stupid website's like, what's your date of birth?
4349479	4353584	Because the content here... No, it's not really the world premiere here, you guys.
4354245	4359611	Let's see if I can... Can I jump forward and just play... I hate live radio sometimes.
4359631	4360292	This is stupid.
4365799	4366240	There you go.
4366540	4367001	See, look.
4367822	4368823	Stone stuff.
4370205	4371366	And a Bethesda logo.
4371386	4372468	And really passionate narration.
4378991	4379851	Harry Potter!
4380792	4382412	Why did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?
4386313	4387093	Anyhow, there it is.
4387153	4389774	It's coming out on November 11th, 2011.
4390134	4391715	That's what they announced as their release date.
4391775	4393575	Good luck meeting that release date.
4393595	4402718	That sounds like a very specific release date and not something that they made to plan a gimmick of a year or anything like that.
4403035	4407436	DarkTetsuya says, Loki should totally be the voice of a gay dragon in a video game.
4407996	4409277	Yes, he should.
4409857	4412898	I like this as a grassroots campaign.
4412938	4413278	No.
4413478	4415158	Loki, you need to be a gay dragon.
4415779	4419199	It was just a... Has anyone watched Family Guy?
4419219	4420400	Do you have something against it?
4420820	4424381	Do they not know of, like, was it the one guy who talks in there all the time?
4425188	4428269	Hey, I'm a bee, you know, I might sting you.
4428489	4430090	Oh, I've stung myself.
4430810	4432191	That's all I was mocking.
4432271	4434912	I mean, I am not playing a gay dragon in anything.
4434932	4436353	That's dumb.
4436513	4438654	That's just like people trying to get me to be the voice of Tingle.
4438934	4440054	No, not gonna happen.
4440294	4440975	Yeah, I enjoy it.
4440995	4445617	Or dressing up like Tingle, or anything that has to do with Tingle, because that character's retarded.
4446057	4453020	If they make some sort of Epic Mickey type game with all the Nintendo characters, then yeah, he'll be in there with, what was that, Captain Rainbow.
4454605	4456686	Yeah, anybody remember Captain Rainbow?
4456846	4457726	Yeah, I didn't think so.
4459067	4462689	I enjoyed the Family Guy parody of aliens that had that character in it.
4463569	4465930	Oh, you're trying to escape with that little girl.
4466470	4468351	I'm gonna bite you with my second face now.
4469211	4470292	Oh no!
4470792	4471652	It's the airlock!
4471833	4473753	Oh no!
4473933	4474874	I have to see that now.
4475868	4478029	Maybe Salacious Pop needs to be the gay dragon.
4478069	4479729	Would you be a gay dragon, Salacious Pop?
4479809	4480269	He's nodding.
4480289	4481169	He'd do the gay dragon.
4481350	4481750	There you go.
4482510	4482810	All right.
4483870	4487311	And Tigerclaw is saying, isn't it 11-1-11, which is a Tuesday?
4487791	4489632	It's not going to come out then anyway.
4490172	4491392	It's going to get delayed.
4491452	4492553	These games always do.
4492913	4493513	Here's the thing, though.
4494153	4500903	Despite the fact that the trailer didn't show us really anything new, I'm just happy that it wasn't a trailer for a multiplayer Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
4501243	4504428	Don't get me wrong, that would have been kind of cool like four years ago.
4505289	4507292	But now it's time to move on to a new game.
4507352	4509095	So I'm excited.
4509600	4511681	Also, some other things that were revealed to the VGAs.
4511721	4514363	There's going to be a Mortal Kombat game on the PlayStation 3.
4514463	4515863	Oh wait, we already knew that.
4516104	4517744	But this trailer had Kratos in it.
4518025	4522867	That's right, Kratos is going to be a playable character in Mortal Kombat on the PS3.
4523768	4526869	So now him and Scorpion can just keep driving hooks into each other.
4526969	4527550	That'll be fun.
4529991	4533713	All they need is Pinhead from Hellraiser to come out and it'll be hook-tastic.
4535497	4542939	You know, when I heard the news that Kratos was in it, that was exactly the thought that came to my mind was, get over here!
4542959	4543779	No, you get over here!
4543879	4544379	Get over here!
4544919	4546740	I will take you both to hell.
4546840	4547900	That's what the trailer was.
4549240	4550121	Was him and Scorpion fighting.
4551421	4552501	Oh, and Mass Effect 3.
4553721	4556702	And there was a trailer for it, and it's coming out holiday 2011.
4558402	4560343	And I'm sure a lot of fanboy...
4562071	4565754	Excitement going on over that one because Mass Effect is a very popular series.
4566955	4567335	There it is.
4568356	4571779	Anyhow, let's get into the classic game of the week.
4571859	4573160	It's a segment here on the show.
4574822	4576263	We can take a look at gaming's past.
4576483	4582528	You know, screw this Elder Scrolls V jib jab and all this talk of Kratos.
4583229	4583969	Damn it, kids!
4584089	4586151	Newfound, fangled game characters.
4586551	4587552	I remember a time...
4588753	4591355	When they look pixelated and we liked it, right, DarkSakura?
4591375	4592255	What's the classic game of the week?
4592275	4592615	Yes, we did.
4593696	4596998	The classic game of the week is Wonder Boy in Monsterland.
4598338	4600099	Ooh.
4600580	4602221	It was put out by Westone.
4602401	4604622	It came out on the Master System.
4605002	4605402	Sorry.
4605622	4606043	Very loud.
4606063	4606463	Sorry.
4607043	4611846	Well, actually, it was in the arcades in 1987, but it came out on the Master System in 1988.
4614428	4616049	Activision released it for the Amiga in 87.
4616169	4623574	It came out on the Commodore 64, the Armstrong CPC, ZX Spectrum, and Atari ST in 1989.
4623894	4630799	It was titled Super Wonder Boy Monster World in Japan, and then Super Wonder Boy Monster Land in Europe.
4631399	4636043	My cartridge of this says Super Wonder Boy Super Monster Land.
4637203	4638824	So, inconsistent, I don't know.
4640365	4648048	It actually was retooled for the Famicom by Jaleco, and it was redone as a version of Journey to the West.
4650209	4656252	Hudson Soft brought it out for Famicom and PC Engine to be like Bikuriman, I guess.
4657516	4665499	It came out in Brazil as Monica no Castelo do Dragao, I guess.
4665599	4666479	I don't speak Portuguese.
4667960	4669841	But I do know that they speak Portuguese in Brazil.
4670201	4670401	Okay.
4671441	4676643	And it was actually based off of the Monica's Gang comics that were in Brazil.
4677333	4684018	and it came out on mobile phones in 2005 and for the virtual console in 2008 in Japan and 2009 over here and in Europe.
4684638	4698409	It was a sequel to the 1986 game Wonder Boy and it's 11 years after that game where everything is peaceful and the evil King Tom Tom basically was gone.
4699169	4704613	And then Wonder Boy, a fire-breathing dragon, showed up
4706054	4712217	and basically wanted to go in and conquer Wonderland, turning it into Monsterland and crap happened.
4712237	4715778	So Wonderboy popped up and he's like, okay, I'll kill the Mecha Dragon.
4716778	4717119	Whatever.
4717659	4722521	So anyway, a lot of this is like, I never cared about the story when I was playing this.
4722541	4724882	I was like, yeah, got a sword.
4726583	4734953	So anyway, it had some slow load times on the computers, had some issues, but it was super fun.
4735314	4739820	The Master System version is indeed the best home version that there is.
4741001	4742703	In my opinion, and that of many others.
4743704	4750988	So, um, the way that it plays is you actually start off in the City of Wonder without anything.
4751989	4755871	Um, but the city's mayor gives you a sword and a revival potion and off you go!
4756111	4757171	It has 12 levels.
4757872	4761594	Each of them have its own neat features and monsters and crap.
4762074	4768798	You use a D-pad to move around and you've got magic weapons that you can select and all kinds of skipping and jumping and smiting things.
4769458	4775741	You have a life meter that is red hearts, the more you can build them up as you go.
4775761	4780763	You start off with five, and when you hit damage they turn black, kind of like Zelda.
4781723	4788846	And you can get gold by killing things, because apparently when monsters die they bark gold.
4789686	4793228	Or you can hit trees and clouds, because gold hangs out in clouds all the time.
4794108	4795869	You also have an hourglass timer.
4796750	4799712	And when the hourglass runs out, Wonder Boy starts losing life.
4799772	4802974	But you can refill it by collecting more hourglasses in hospitals or taverns.
4803355	4807518	Because that's always where I look for my hourglasses, is with some beer or sick people.
4807898	4810140	Of course gold hangs out in clouds.
4810200	4811641	Where do the golden showers come from?
4813922	4817105	On the ZX Spectrum version, you had a candle for your timer.
4818246	4830435	For the Master System version, you had a status screen, so it's just to show you what you got, how much gold you have, what your armor, your equipment, because I carry a status screen around with me all the time, too.
4830455	4837700	I just usually, whenever you see me drowning out, it's usually, I'm looking at my status screen going, damn, I need more stuff.
4838540	4848186	You also have the magic weapons, like I said before, you have bombs that roll on the ground, and fireballs, and tornadoes, because I also carry tornadoes in my pocket.
4848866	4852048	And a thunder flash that damages everything on the screen.
4854410	4856671	So basically, there's lots of little secret stuff in there.
4856811	4861054	It looks like the character also, in his weakest form, is wandering around in a diaper.
4864347	4868131	All this talk of golden showers and diapers is making me very sick, just so you know.
4868891	4873576	But it is one of the earlier roleplay games, action-adventure roleplay.
4873836	4885386	It was pretty fun, came out on a bunch of stuff like I said before, and Wonder Boy in Monsterland is one of the, I'd say, one of the top Master System games.
4886307	4893352	And I'm really not surprised, you know, that it got its own special release in Brazil because they love the Master System in Brazil.
4894172	4894873	Oh my gosh.
4895753	4896274	Seriously?
4896554	4906380	There's like so many Sega games were retooled, like Genesis games even, were retooled to come out on the Master System because they love the Master System in Brazil.
4906520	4908502	Mm-hmm.
4909783	4909823	Um...
4911603	4913524	It did really well.
4914985	4917105	Got some pretty high ratings.
4918866	4923688	The lowest of its ratings were the Amiga, followed by the Commodore 64.
4923768	4928830	Master System, though, really, really hit the top of the chart.
4929890	4935272	And there were other games that came out along the same lines.
4935352	4938013	Monster Boy, Wonder Boy Monster Land, though.
4938633	4939974	I'd have to put that up at Pinnacle.
4941229	4941629	Alright.
4943129	4943590	And you know what?
4943610	4945010	I'm going to check my status screen now.
4948170	4951751	There it is, your classic game of the week, Wonder Boy in Monster Land.
4952511	4954132	Arcadian, I know you like the Sega games.
4954152	4955412	Do you have any fond memories of this one?
4955692	4957032	I've only played this one a little bit.
4957052	4960733	The thing is, before I played this one, I played the third one.
4961293	4968595	It's like the Monster Boy... Wonder Boy 3, The Dragon's Trap, which is actually one of my favorite games.
4968615	4969575	You get turned into a dragon?
4970956	4971997	I was like, he looks like Boba Boba.
4988999	4994384	I only got to play this one a little bit, and it's kind of hard at the beginning.
4994684	4996866	I'm going to grab the cartridge, by the way, and take a picture of it.
4996986	4999429	This is one of the few Master System games that I remember playing.
4999489	5001871	That's why I was kind of excited to see this as the pick.
5002211	5005615	Now, some of the chatters were thinking, hasn't this game been done before?
5006075	5006435	Nope.
5006595	5007656	You got to check our wiki.
5007697	5009198	It has been done before.
5009378	5013501	Yeah, and DarkSakura's yelling from the other room, it was Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
5013541	5018584	And Alex Kidd and the series have some similarities, but no, they're very different games.
5018965	5021406	So you can always check our wiki, because I know DarkSakura does.
5021446	5025509	I think she's at the point where she checks our wiki every... And tonight's game is already on there.
5025689	5027250	That's how awesome our wiki updating community is.
5027270	5034015	Yes, I do check the wiki, which is, I was gonna do Alex Kidd and Shinobi World, and I was like, you know, I had to have done Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
5034575	5037377	So I will take a picture of Super Wonder Boy Super Monster Land.
5038129	5041971	OrangeLoungeRadio.wikia.com is where that is all at, if you're curious.
5042672	5043832	Meanwhile, we're going to take a break.
5044493	5046814	It's break time here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
5046834	5048275	We'll be right back with plenty more.
5048315	5049376	We have more news coming up.

5086700	5089663	Orange Launch Radio isn't the only show some of us here in the studio produce.
5089703	5091664	We've been trying to really sell our spinoff shows lately.
5092185	5097069	The one I do is called Horde House, and it was a huge week this week with the release of World of Warcraft Cataclysm.
5097389	5102253	If you have some interest in World of Warcraft, don't worry, we won't tell that you're downloading the show and listening to it.
5102293	5102733	It's okay.
5102813	5103754	It can be our little secret.
5104154	5109378	Just search for Horde House on iTunes or whatever favorite podcast program you like.
5109699	5113682	We don't really have an official website yet, but you can get all the podcasts at
5114122	5138278	HordeHousePodcast.blogspot.com I think is where you can get all the mp3s directly if you're like ew I hate iTunes so that'll work DarkSakura has a show too yes it's called Comic Insanity as in the letter N with no I before it and we are on excuse me not on cough we're on infamous.net that's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net
5139797	5165300	and it's me and Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow and we talk about comics usually we'll discuss the stuff coming out and what we've read all this month we are doing a best of like what was our favorite what was the worst you know how much Tiara is pissed off at Matt Fraction for how he's writing Iron Man he who shall not be named which I can say on this show Jeff Loeb
5166821	5167081	Sorry.
5167942	5170123	Thank you for ruining everything, Jeff Loeb.
5171244	5174606	And, you know, talk about how much Rob Liefeld can't draw and all that.
5175346	5176827	There might be some crossover.
5177528	5186513	It's like your favorite fanfic come to life this week because one of the hosts over on Comic Insanity who's not Jamie wants to come be on Horde House and we're going to try to make that happen in the next couple weeks.
5186533	5188154	That is so completely not a surprise.
5189515	5195858	We're all a bunch of addicts, and you're trying to get me addicted.
5196199	5198139	Just pass the needle over, Rob.
5198159	5199960	Puff, puff, pass.
5202642	5204002	I'll wear the track marks for you, Rob.
5204983	5209925	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, some rapid-fire news.
5210706	5210966	Loki.
5211874	5212034	Yes.
5213774	5221876	So this is more stuff kind of coming... Well, at least this one is coming out of the Spike Video Game Awards.
5223217	5228638	Actually, earlier this week they announced that Uncharted 3 Drake's Deception is coming out.
5229198	5231599	Now we know that it's coming out sometime in 2011.
5232799	5234300	My guess would be the fall.
5235300	5248224	And apparently the game will feature Drake and partner Sully on a hunt for a lost city and a journey that leads them to the Arabian Peninsula and Rubal Kali Desert.
5249444	5258467	And they said that the story not only lifts from the life of Sir Francis Drake, but also the British Army officer and archaeologist T.E.
5258747	5261028	Lawrence, as in Arabia.
5262308	5269135	and this was kind of shown off a little bit during the VGAs and also they had a preview in Entertainment Weekly.
5269195	5271177	That's crossing over for you now, isn't it?
5272338	5275441	And of course, you know, the movie that's going to suck.
5276281	5277482	Fortunately, Mark Wahlberg
5279735	5280735	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5303502	5306785	There was a movie where he was with Leonardo DiCaprio or something like that.
5307806	5308927	It was like some mobster movie.
5310408	5311088	I'll take your word for it.
5311369	5312209	But he was good in that.
5312269	5314331	But yeah, happening.
5315772	5317153	Kind of wish it didn't happen.
5319235	5320376	But the riff track is awesome.
5320596	5324900	Seriously, if you got to watch that movie once in your life, watch it with the riff tracks.
5327812	5342338	Other fun stuff, and this is kind of cool because it's been out on the PC and the Wii, but now PlayStation 3 owners will get the chance to play Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people.
5342978	5348940	It'll be coming out on December 21st, and it's also coming to Mac as well.
5351422	5377715	um doesn't really say what the pricing is going to be yet but apparently um you know they're saying in comparison the PC right now all five episodes are um on sale for $29.95 so something maybe around that price um that's kind of cool and then finally Jacino Rama is screaming in the chat that The Departed was a good movie that was The Departed yes that's the one that he was in so um
5379511	5387534	And finally, if you're a fan of Quake, Quake Arena Arcade is finally coming to Xbox Live Arcade on December 15th.
5387994	5389254	So you can check that out.
5389314	5390255	It's very similar.
5390315	5392355	I think it's based off Quake 3 Arena.
5392775	5400498	This is the first first-person shooter on Xbox in a very long time I'm really excited about and I hope other OLR people are going to play because I actually really like Quake.
5402999	5403439	Good times.
5404159	5406800	So if you want to get fragged, you have to let me know.
5408658	5412220	Any other special features coming with that, or is it just like a straight-up PortaQuake 3, or what?
5412240	5414361	It looks a little different.
5415562	5421905	It's kind of... It doesn't really say if it's going to be a little different.
5422025	5427308	I thought it was going to be kind of similar to the one that they have right now, like the browser game, but maybe not.
5427328	5428028	I don't know.
5428909	5430249	What were you saying over there, DarkSakura?
5430810	5432991	I said, what if we want to be fraggled?
5433274	5441781	Well, maybe I'll have to get SSJ100Matt to get that little thing on his controller that plays the songs, and every time I frag somebody, I can do the theme song.
5441801	5443282	We both clapped.
5452464	5452845	That's enough.
5453465	5454106	All right.
5454146	5454986	Some other quick news.
5455207	5459891	Loki's just sitting there going, I'm just going to play poker on my little iPod.
5459971	5461092	It's swords and poker.
5461152	5461712	Oh, I'm sorry.
5461792	5462553	Swords and poker.
5462593	5463353	My bad.
5463694	5464534	Y'all, my bad.
5464595	5467277	It's swords and poker because that's so different.
5468901	5472403	There's a new DDR game coming out on the Xbox 360.
5473404	5476886	It will actually support the Xbox Live Vision Camera.
5477407	5478447	Ooh, come on!
5478788	5480909	No one has... Oh, no one should have that.
5480929	5482070	Here's the deal, guys.
5482250	5485572	It's pretty much a port of the PlayStation 3 version, just without the move stuff.
5485652	5486853	That's pretty much what this is.
5487133	5488013	It's not even Kinect.
5488674	5493417	It's just DDR, like you've known it, but not quite... It's not a universe.
5494077	5497860	I guess this is what that whole... Remember when they were going to reboot DDR...
5498400	5499541	It's new!
5499721	5501083	Yeah, this is it.
5501223	5503045	But now it's just kind of landing like a poop in the toilet.
5503065	5505567	By the way, that didn't already come out on PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
5506008	5506228	Yeah.
5506708	5506929	Yeah.
5507509	5508350	And no one cared.
5509911	5512714	This is just Konami dropping the kids off at the pool.
5512994	5515057	That's really what they're doing at this point.
5516698	5518679	But hey, DDR fans, hope you enjoy it.
5519800	5522041	Coming to the PSN, Neo Geo Games.
5522201	5528385	See, I kind of thought this was a dub because I seem to remember in the Japanese releases I was talking about a Neo Geo controller that was coming out for the PlayStation.
5528805	5543513	But whatever, some news is hitting out this week that starting December 22nd, the Neo Geo Station is coming out on the PlayStation Network and it will sell games for 900 yen for the PlayStation 3 versions of the game and PSP versions of games for 700 yen.
5544794	5551657	So it's games like Baseball Stars Professional, Magician Road, Metal Slug, League Bowling, Super Sidekicks Magician Road?
5552537	5565381	No, yeah, it's Magician's Lord Magician Lord Somebody made a typo typo in that one Unless that's what it was called in Japan That could be what it was And Art of Fighting, we're all coming out Oh yay, Art of Fighting You know what's funny?
5565862	5566882	I think I have all those games
5567981	5573265	It's basically Game Room on your PlayStation 3 with Neo Geo stuff.
5574546	5576067	And yes, it'll be coming to the U.S.
5576107	5577228	PlayStation Network as well.
5577268	5578369	December 21st.
5579349	5582892	$8.99 for a PS3 game and $7 for a PSP game.
5583893	5587855	All in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Neo Geo.
5588136	5589537	Can you believe that, DarkSakura?
5590117	5590998	20 years old.
5591638	5592639	We're old.
5593760	5594320	I have one.
5595020	5597062	Also, don't you have like several games?
5597552	5598333	of Neo Geo?
5598493	5598813	Yeah.
5598934	5605040	No, I have a Neo Geo, a Neo Geo CD, and one Neo Geo pocket, and two Neo Geo pocket callers.
5605140	5605721	So several.
5606725	5607586	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5629383	5630343	and Duodesim.
5630383	5633204	That's the new Dissida, the sequel that's coming out on the PSP.
5633584	5640346	It was announced in Shonen Jump, a weekly magazine in Japan, that Laguna is going to be one of the new characters.
5640387	5641867	That's kind of rad, actually.
5642347	5643728	Laguna was a really good character.
5644668	5648349	And yeah, I'm sure the Final Fantasy VIII fans will be pleased.
5648469	5648929	DarkSakura.
5649810	5654371	Well, how about something that isn't Laguna, Mr. FanboyWank?
5656127	5657728	I'm sorry, I did not like Laguna.
5657948	5658409	Just saying.
5658889	5660930	It was all about Irvine and his gun.
5663292	5665814	But how about some Billy Joel?
5667435	5668456	Kids like Billy Joel.
5669457	5674520	And apparently kids are going to like Billy Joel enough to have a Billy Joel pack for Rock Band.
5675321	5676602	Yay.
5678342	5680123	Will it have We Didn't Start the Fire in it?
5699890	5704697	and there are, I think, which one has the expansion?
5705137	5708522	Pressure has the pro bass expansion available.
5709683	5711525	So, you know what?
5711626	5713508	There's a song that I should send you.
5713628	5714890	It's the best recording of it I have.
5714950	5716412	Weird Al, one of his live songs.
5716832	5717954	Is it still Billy Joel to me?
5718888	5720951	Thanks for watching!
5736111	5741514	This is really dumb, but a lot of work went into this really dumb project that they pulled off pretty well.
5741614	5741935	I don't know.
5743315	5749379	Salacious Pop was over when I was playing it, and you could hear the song playing, and he was like, ah, are you watching that video?
5751081	5751782	Sorry, DarkSakura.
5751962	5753723	I just was mesmerized by the next story.
5781526	5783967	You're going to share with our listeners or are you just going to sit there and watch it?
5784648	5790110	The next two characters that are going to be out for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is Crimson Viper and Storm.
5790630	5794012	And I don't give a shit about Crimson Viper because Crimson Viper stands for cheap bitch.
5795092	5797413	But Storm, cool.
5797534	5800495	And it's even her more current comic book outfit too.
5801255	5806378	So this is pretty awesome even though right now Magneto's kicking her in the face.
5808859	5811340	Also, Storm has a very impressive rack in this game.
5812481	5813181	That's important.
5813641	5814622	Yes, yes it is.
5814882	5815442	Very important.
5815482	5824867	But it looks like her attacks might be actually taken from her old X-Men vs. Street Fighter.
5825387	5828629	Just completely done up and made incredible.
5828929	5829789	It's really pretty.
5829989	5832711	Her Ice Storm attack is really, really nice.
5833611	5835432	And Crimson Viper is a cheap bitch.
5837714	5840540	What's Her Face With The Glowing Feng Shui Eye
5847335	5850257	There's going to be like 11 billion characters in this game anyway.
5850317	5853839	Hey, Capcom, put in Strider, hear you.
5855039	5855660	The end.
5856040	5857041	Oh, look, there's Morgan's boots.
5857061	5859042	Or give us just a new Strider game, The End.
5859602	5861963	Or bring Strider from the NES to the Virtual Console.
5861983	5862283	No.
5862984	5864265	I like that one, I'm sorry.
5864285	5867867	Yeah, but it was based off the comics in...
5868667	5869527	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5891393	5894835	I'm, wow, and dude, Black Spider-Man, that's awesome.
5895055	5899056	Okay, so how about some other, other, other, other news?
5899156	5902818	And this is having to do with Fallout New Vegas.
5904198	5909801	This is, well, a bunch of, a bunch of fixings of stuff.
5911024	5911805	The game is great.
5911925	5912886	I've seen it in action.
5913246	5915069	It's got stuff wrong with it.
5916651	5921237	What the fixes will now have is companions now show up as waypoints on the map.
5921317	5925202	Companions will always fast travel with you unless told to wait or sent away.
5925883	5928785	Download content error slash save corruption is fixed.
5929286	5932869	Entering the strip after debt collector causes game to crash and auto save corruption.
5932909	5933629	That's been fixed.
5934090	5940134	Another fix is using the Mojave Express Dropbox can cause DLC warnings.
5940154	5940795	That's fixed.
5941355	5945519	Crafting menu now filters valid bright recipes to the top of the list.
5946199	5948640	Weathered Pistol no longer glitches when applying mods.
5949520	5953701	And also quite a number of other things were fixed.
5954581	5958862	And lots of fixes for pretty much a ton of the quests.
5959703	5964484	So, go update Fallout New Vegas.
5965160	5965500	All right.
5966301	5967843	Let's get to the Twitter topics.
5967883	5972547	Let's go check the tweeter and see what folks are tweeting to us this week.
5972647	5974429	Twitter.com slash OLR.
5975009	5978733	If you want to interact with the show, you want to say, hey, the Twitter's a good way to do that.
5978773	5980515	Let's start with a tweet from Blue Swim tonight.
5980535	5985960	You remember Blue Swim was the Techno Kitten Adventure tweet that started that whole stuff.
5986320	5990144	Alright, this tweet probably won't inspire an interview, but it's interesting nonetheless.
5990484	5993647	It has to do with a Kinect flying machine.
5994408	5994888	That's right.
5994968	6008201	Apparently it's this whole thing where you have this mini-copter and it sees itself in the Kinect and it avoids obstacles by detecting them on the Kinect and it knows its own altitude.
6009022	6009603	It's crazy.
6009703	6012525	I guess there's a backup motion capture device involved in everything.
6012865	6013826	But there's a YouTube.
6013886	6019049	I have to mute Santa there for a minute so we can look at the YouTube here in studio of this thing in motion.
6019369	6022452	And I guess you can kind of actually see how the Kinect senses things around.
6023252	6024533	And now there goes the copter.
6024593	6025154	It's flying.
6026283	6035027	I'll buy it's lonesome and I guess this guy's gonna take a cardboard tube and like try to whack it out of the air but it's gonna know that it's there and it'll say like oh I better fly away from that.
6035287	6036167	He's not trying hard enough.
6036568	6036768	Yeah.
6037648	6038568	He needs to be faster.
6039369	6041290	You could do like real baseball with this.
6042930	6046492	Have a baseball just floating in midair and then just flack right through the TV.
6046512	6047732	That'd be more like T-ball.
6048753	6049973	Maybe in this case K-ball.
6050153	6051014	T-ball, I like that.
6051634	6052374	Alright, anyhow.
6053155	6053615	Back to Santa.
6059442	6061604	Let's see, other tweets.
6062084	6066687	Blue Swim wants to know if any of us are going to pick up the Super Mario All-Stars Wii port.
6067728	6067988	No.
6070310	6070610	Anybody?
6071111	6071391	Anybody?
6073413	6074433	If someone gives it to me.
6075174	6076795	I can't wait to buy the Mario game.
6077275	6078136	What, you mean the new one?
6078476	6080198	No, all of them, again and again.
6080218	6081238	Forever.
6081298	6081759	Forever.
6085549	6109779	some stuff from Spazinator is tweeting us to know number one two quick notes for us number one I'd recommend that everyone catch the last episode of FNG live next Friday it's a good show I am a show actually I don't want to sound like Debbie Downer I thought it was already over but if it's not then yes you should go support our buddy Bobby because I know he's worked very hard on that project and
6110519	6116184	It's a bummer, but you know what they say, all good things, dot dot dot, was the last episode of Star Trek.
6116284	6125231	Spazinator also says, as self-serving as it sounds, and seeing that there's no official blog posting for it, follow me on Twitter for news on PSN video freebies.
6125919	6148793	you know you should instead of doing it through your Twitter dude get like a blog spot or a tumblr or something and any idiot can have a blog look at us we have a podcast just go on iTunes iTunes is living proof that any idiot can podcast you can do better than Twitter Spazinator I know you can I believe in you do you believe in Spazinator
6149673	6149913	Huh?
6150433	6150633	Yeah.
6150994	6151334	Alright.
6151974	6153775	Yes, whatever you just said, Rob.
6154015	6154995	No, that was perfect.
6155015	6155376	That was fine.
6155856	6161418	Funny T-Man wants to link us to, look, I found a Technokitten ripoff.
6162339	6165140	Oh my god, the clone games, I guess, are starting now.
6165560	6169282	There's a game on Xbox Live, any marketplace that he links us to.
6169322	6173884	Again, this is Funny T-Man on Twitter called Asteroids Do Concern Me.
6176645	6176985	What?
6177005	6178366	What?
6179136	6182777	That's actually, that was one of the indie games that they had.
6183797	6184197	Oh, I see.
6184217	6189499	Some of the levels are serious, but there's like this third level here that's unicorns and pooping rainbows.
6189519	6193720	That's one of the ones that they showed, you know, as part of the indie games push that they're doing.
6193740	6194480	Remember right now?
6196941	6197221	Yeah.
6198101	6198821	It looked interesting.
6199081	6202402	Is there like a Raver Puppy Odyssey game coming out or something?
6202422	6202562	Yeah.
6203817	6204818	No, but it can.
6205319	6205779	It should.
6205839	6206500	That would be awesome.
6206520	6206760	Let's see.
6206800	6210564	I'm looking at the official trailer for Asteroids Do Concern Me.
6211565	6212246	Let's see here.
6213747	6214888	Waiting to see some gameplay.
6215289	6215669	Here we go.
6217491	6220374	Oh, this is like the same type of thing where you use the button to float up and down.
6220434	6221916	It just moves really fast.
6223817	6224919	And you collect orbs.
6226793	6230898	I have to admit, this actually looks a little more advanced than Technogit Adventure.
6231118	6232039	Where's the meowing?
6233241	6235684	But I guess there's... Oh, there's some cute little modes.
6235704	6236004	What's this?
6236064	6236364	Okay.
6236945	6238147	Double Rainbow mode.
6238387	6238907	Aha!
6238987	6239668	Double Rainbow.
6239748	6240529	Of course.
6241390	6242171	What does it mean?
6242191	6242532	What does it mean?
6245183	6245603	Hey, Rob.
6246404	6247064	That one's cool.
6247524	6248045	Doodle mode.
6248225	6260553	Noah's awesome, though, about that whole game right there as part of that trailer where they're like, yeah, we're sick of the people cloning games out there, and they show off the games that they have and the ones that they're pushing.
6260934	6262214	A lot of them are clones of other things.
6262254	6263075	But see, here's the thing.
6263115	6266677	You know why you can't call Asteroids Do Concern Me a ripoff?
6266737	6270400	Because it's missing two very, very, very important things.
6270480	6272001	Yes, the gameplay is the same, but here's the thing.
6272021	6272641	Techno and kittens?
6272882	6273002	It's...
6274162	6274602	That's right!
6275443	6279384	It's missing kittens, and it's missing happy hardcore.
6284085	6285125	Everybody rave!
6286125	6288206	Peace, love, unity, respect.
6288226	6289386	My name's Starshine.
6290367	6291287	Such a great rave.
6295151	6297736	You guys, let's drop some E and make out!
6297796	6299178	Oh my gosh, you guys!
6299218	6299759	Yay!
6301061	6302223	Let's make some candy!
6305219	6308442	I'll trade you this candy necklace for your candy wristband.
6308802	6309703	Woo!
6309923	6314366	And then a big gust of wind gets caught in their JNCO pants wide like jeans and they blow off.
6319130	6321272	TigerClaw305 sends us some tweets.
6321812	6325615	Blockbuster laughed at a Netflix partnership proposal in 2000.
6326816	6327597	Isn't it always funny?
6327637	6331660	You get these hindsight as 2020 stories and it's kind of like, look who's laughing now.
6331900	6333262	This is the story I think it is.
6333342	6337988	It was a part of the deal was that the Netflix brand had to remain.
6338609	6343436	And Blockbuster was like, no, if we do anything, it's got to have the Blockbuster name on it.
6343456	6346380	We don't think this is a viable way of delivering rentals.
6346400	6347041	Yeah.
6348361	6348682	Fail.
6348822	6351403	They thought it was a very small niche business.
6352403	6354784	This is just some flash in the pan that's going to go away.
6355064	6356585	DVDs over the mail.
6356985	6357545	Come on.
6357585	6358626	That's like groceries to your door.
6358646	6359947	This is some web van shit.
6360287	6361307	No, no.
6362448	6363908	That's on the interwebs.
6364809	6367650	That's just college kids and junkies on the interwebs.
6369907	6374429	I hate Blockbuster so much, so I get the best schadenfreude from anything.
6377550	6380092	Blockbuster's CEO for types of cancer.
6380132	6382052	I'm like, that's because you run Blockbuster.
6382072	6382613	I gave it to you.
6382733	6383373	Wow!
6383673	6384974	That's vicious.
6385714	6386534	That's really horrible.
6386554	6389776	No, I'm being hyperbole right now.
6389796	6392537	You know, not all of them are corporate-run stores, by the way.
6393573	6395715	Yeah, that's... Can I dig into this a little more?
6395755	6396095	Hold on.
6396155	6398117	Why do you have such hatred for Blockbuster?
6398837	6399818	They used to work for them.
6399838	6403121	There are certain movies... You have a $60 late fee still, don't you?
6403141	6405182	There are certain movies that they just wouldn't carry.
6405402	6411047	Like, if it was a rated R movie, but it was an LGBT-themed movie, like Boys Don't Cry with Hilary Swank, they wouldn't carry it.
6411087	6414670	They just had this weird sort of censorship, like family-friendly stuff.
6414710	6415290	It's bullshit.
6415330	6416531	Let people rent movies what they want.
6416591	6417492	Don't... Yeah.
6417632	6419974	Is that the showgirls with the bras drawn on?
6420154	6421597	Yeah, that's the copy.
6421758	6424404	If they had a copy of Showgirls at all, that's the copy they would have.
6424945	6426669	So Netflix all the way.
6426910	6427371	I don't care.
6428047	6428848	$55 if you want it though
6453324	6460827	That just makes me think that it would get really linty and cruddy because even if you use a mouse a lot, they get kind of gross.
6461327	6462888	So I don't know why you'd want buttons on there.
6463048	6463748	Not my mouse.
6464028	6465809	My mouse smells like kittens and rainbows.
6466489	6467029	It's perfect.
6467049	6468270	I don't know what you're talking about.
6468830	6474012	And lastly, a tweet from Gamer Girl who wants us to know, La Mulana rocks, just saying.
6475885	6476426	Go ahead, girl.
6476526	6477286	Go ahead, gamer girl.
6477767	6478648	With your La Mulana.
6479348	6480189	There it is, our tweets.
6480329	6482932	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
6483532	6486775	Actdeft wants us to know that Netflix isn't in Mexico.
6487256	6492080	He says, since Netflix doesn't exist here, I'm still stuck with Blockbuster and it ain't bad.
6492661	6493181	It ain't bad.
6494162	6494382	Yeah.
6494683	6494863	Yeah.
6497757	6500118	I mean, are Mexican blockbusters the same as the ones here?
6500819	6501199	Pretty much.
6501239	6504941	Do they still sell the candy up front as much as you pay for at the movie theater?
6504961	6510364	Wouldn't there be a 7-Eleven next door to get the same thing for a sixth this much money?
6511505	6511985	Just curious.
6514192	6514853	Thanks for watching!
6532495	6537718	Anyways, so, of course, one of the highlights is how well did the Kinect do?
6537878	6538718	And it did pretty well.
6539258	6545381	It actually outsold the PlayStation Move 5-1 in November, which is pretty impressive, I'd say.
6546241	6546381	And...
6547762	6552808	Also, of course, Microsoft didn't do too bad with Xbox 360 systems.
6552828	6555611	They sold 1.37 million units in November.
6556452	6561758	And they said that it puts the Kinect bundle figure range around 685,000 units.
6561798	6564802	And the Move console bundles around...
6568887	6583565	1,337,000 units and it says right now global sales have topped 2.5 million units and Sony has reported 4.1 million Playstation Move units have been shipped to retailers though the company hasn't disclosed actual sales numbers and
6584566	6586407	Let me be honest here.
6586587	6588569	4.1 million and 2.5 million.
6589089	6594492	I don't want to sound biased or anything, but you're comparing move units versus the Kinect.
6594512	6595473	The Kinect, you need one.
6595793	6597614	The move, you may need up to four.
6597634	6603918	That's a little... Are they counting the nav controller on top of that?
6604378	6607540	It's a little wonky, those numbers, but...
6608580	6609241	Fuzzy Math
6630040	6633001	Some of the top games, of course, for November.
6633262	6634282	It's not a big surprise.
6634322	6635963	Call of Duty Black Ops being number one.
6636003	6637944	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, number two.
6638684	6640145	Although number three is kind of surprising.
6640205	6644207	Just Dance 2 is the top title for November.
6644947	6650290	Followed by Madden 11, Fable 3, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, Gran Turismo 5.
6651130	6653212	NBA 2K11, and Wii Fit Plus.
6654012	6655794	Because people still buy Wii Fit Plus.
6656374	6660517	And of course, with the Kinect titles coming out, it's no wonder.
6661638	6670204	I mean, you're going to guess the best-selling title for the Kinect, other than obviously Kinect Adventures, because that comes with the actual units, Dan Central.
6671345	6679271	It was the number 11 title overall in sales for the month, and the top-selling Kinect title as a standalone SKU.
6681405	6681665	Awesome.
6682246	6684087	And who says music games are dead?
6685849	6686449	I don't know who.
6687970	6688270	People.
6689151	6695456	If Harmonix is up for sale, though, that's not necessarily a good sign, but maybe this will help.
6695476	6695856	I'll buy it for $2.
6696977	6697338	Stop.
6698338	6698659	All right.
6698739	6699699	Nobody in the debt, though.
6699719	6700440	They can keep the debt.
6702077	6709990	Apparently, yeah, there's some... I've got a story, and believe it or not, guys, pay attention, because it involves video games and it involves pornography.
6710030	6710390	You ready?
6710991	6712934	It has to do with Nintendo porn.
6713856	6715037	Apparently, there's a website.
6715077	6715799	I've never heard of this.
6715919	6717081	VideoGamePorn.com
6717961	6732930	It received a notice from SciValence, which is a company I guess it was hired by Nintendo, saying that the site has been committing trademark violation because they used the name Nintendo to describe an image of a scantily clad woman who holds a Nintendo DS.
6733550	6739954	So it's like, chick with boobies out plays Nintendo DS, and now Nintendo is like, OBJECTION!
6741735	6742976	You can't say Nintendo.
6743156	6746538	VideoGamePorn.net Oh, are you looking this up?
6746898	6747138	Yeah.
6748668	6751811	We are an internet monitoring agency representing Nintendo of America, Inc.,
6772268	6783691	We are writing to ask you to stop using the Nintendo properties in the hidden text, visible text, meta tags, and or title, and or other links of the above-referenced sexually explicit website.
6784091	6784491	You know what?
6785512	6787912	Me reading this just by itself isn't working for me.
6787972	6788812	This needs something.
6789353	6790033	What could this use?
6790593	6790953	You know what?
6791113	6791333	I know.
6791453	6791673	I know.
6792213	6793774	Play something sexy for me.
6796380	6799461	Nintendo's customers include many children and their parents.
6800141	6806504	Unauthorized use of Nintendo's trademarks and works is harmful to those customers and will tarnish Nintendo's reputation.
6807124	6812646	We look forward to your immediate confirmation that you have taken the necessary steps to resolve this matter.
6813047	6819129	To that end, you may email us at stopinfringementatcivalence.com I probably shouldn't have given that out, huh?
6820100	6825765	Please note that these are automatic email boxes, so typically no response is sent as long as the problem is corrected.
6826186	6826406	What?
6827867	6830710	So, in other words, it's just like this whole automated thing?
6832111	6834293	Click button, send cease and desist notice?
6835314	6836034	That's awesome.
6836295	6837216	That's interesting.
6837476	6840739	And now everybody in studio is looking at geekgirlsonline.com.
6840859	6841780	I got bored of it really quick.
6841820	6842240	That wasn't the site.
6842280	6843661	That was just a link on the site.
6843862	6844282	Oh, I see.
6844963	6846064	It was videogameporn.net.
6847386	6848247	I want to see the naughty.
6848627	6853290	Oh, look at, oh, she is definitely using a DSI to cover up her naughty bits.
6853990	6861655	And like, I like this because in one, in one picture here, she's showing, okay, I'm, I'm using the DSI to take a picture of my panties.
6862136	6862656	You see that?
6863016	6863857	That's one picture.
6864217	6866479	And then in another, she's, she's using the DSI.
6866519	6871122	She's holding it up to her face and she's like, oh, maybe I'll take an artful picture with my DSI.
6871542	6874404	And then the last picture, she's just fingering her pussy.
6874424	6874504	Okay.
6875652	6878554	and there's no DSI whatsoever.
6878634	6881756	It's just, hey, I decided to put it away.
6883698	6884658	Guess where I put it?
6884758	6885879	I found a new toy.
6889282	6891243	Yeah, my mind, the jokes right now.
6891383	6892484	Please, by all means.
6893084	6894425	You're going to ruin your stylus.
6894605	6895726	You have to get another one.
6895746	6898248	That's why she has an XL.
6900603	6903126	Her belly button has very awkward placement.
6903166	6906010	Doesn't her belly button kind of look like really left of center?
6906711	6908793	Like, doesn't that kind of like look like a gunshot wound?
6908813	6910435	That is where the stylist is right now.
6912238	6912598	I don't know.
6912618	6913679	It's perspective, Rob.
6914280	6915582	Either that or bad photoshopping.
6917864	6919246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6939989	6948059	Anyway, it's already been going on here, but now Amazon UK is going to be paying for old games and trade-in.
6949040	6953105	You can print up a prepaid delivery label for your box.
6955547	6956709	Sorry, I was thinking of the last story.
6958354	6965100	And for example, if you send a Medal of Honor, you'll get a 23-pound gift card credited to your account.
6965140	6966301	That's a heavy gift card.
6968222	6970304	I see what you... How's British Money Joke?
6970404	6970965	I like that.
6971345	6972586	Okay, then I'll change it.
6973186	6975548	For Just Dance 2, you get 15 quid.
6975909	6976389	How's that?
6977290	6979391	For Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, 28 quid.
6980612	6982314	So now you can't make a joke about that.
6984560	6985120	Well, we could.
6985160	6986160	It probably just wouldn't be funny.
6986340	6987901	But I think it's like up to three.
6988341	6991662	And if your game's broken, they're going to send it back.
6993022	6998103	And they'll basically just send you a confirmation to say you can have the money or you can't.
6998843	7000664	And then they'll send it back in two weeks.
7002564	7004624	Really faulty stuff may be just thrown away.
7004684	7006825	So I guess maybe it's a free way of getting rid of shit.
7007605	7008665	You might get stuff back.
7008745	7011646	But it's supposed to be, again, three a month.
7013666	7020652	There's an ad on that page you're reading from that says insert coin and I can't help but think that's what the girl was trying to do in the picture.
7021512	7024655	I was looking at the one that said in Soviet Russia games make you stronger.
7025661	7047540	I can't get off of boobs and apparently neither can our chat room there's jokes about the res trans vibrator the ps3 controller that vibrates Tiger Claw saying that stylus is not a suppository put that down all these gems coming from chat.org that's not where you put a suppository suppositories go in your ass not your cooch some girls like to play with both
7049158	7050338	You ever heard of the shocker?
7050898	7055480	Yeah, but I was saying... It's not a suppository.
7056420	7058660	We're going to do a math lesson for DarkSakura.
7058760	7061681	Two plus one is fun.
7063682	7066242	Professor Layton in the case of the cantankerous clitoris.
7069483	7074964	I wish I'd taken a picture of the gesture that Rob made when he made his little addition thing.
7075325	7076765	That's not on my algebra final!
7078502	7082145	SolarFlare in our chatroom says, I thought Nintendo already knew about their products and porn.
7082165	7083887	They sell the rubbers for their Wiimotes.
7084327	7085468	Oh, Wii condom joke.
7085508	7085928	I like that.
7086729	7087890	You know what OLR needs?
7088731	7093875	We need a contest that's like best slash fiction involving Nintendo characters.
7094576	7096697	And it should just be as absurd as possible.
7098199	7099420	Do you think there's some good Mario games?
7099600	7102302	I've read absurd fan fiction.
7102662	7102943	Really?
7106528	7108049	Hey, Pantanos, it's the Super Mario Brothers Super Show!
7129946	7130686	What's it rated?
7131427	7133708	If it's M or A, then automatically we'll know it's something good.
7133768	7139530	It's M. Okay.
7139610	7141471	Okay, so Mario's rescuing the princess.
7144652	7145513	Thank you, Mario.
7145593	7146613	The kingdom is saved.
7146813	7148254	Now you will get a nice reward.
7148294	7148834	Uh-oh.
7149074	7149995	Uh-oh.
7163041	7164581	Oh, thank God this is a radio show.
7166882	7168343	Wow, the princess bent over.
7171744	7175406	Is Bowser going to just get Mario from behind while he's on?
7175606	7176066	I don't know.
7177627	7178267	One day later.
7178287	7180108	Shotgun wedding.
7180128	7180748	Nine months later.
7188119	7188859	She's in labor.
7189259	7191300	Those are labor pains you're hitting right now.
7191660	7193560	Oh, it's baby Luigi.
7196201	7196901	Oh, no.
7203202	7206943	And now baby Yoshi's coming out and baby Toad.
7206963	7208283	Mario Party 12.
7208803	7210204	Each pulls a train.
7221690	7226932	You know what's funny is that video's probably like six years old and we're just now playing this like it's something brand spanking new.
7226972	7230473	There's the link in chat so you guys can giggle with us.
7230693	7238735	And the 13-year-old that made that six years ago now has some web shockwave HTML5 job, you know, making tons of money.
7239115	7241216	Got his start in high school making Mario porn.
7243076	7245157	Why did Nintendo send a cease and desist to that?
7245217	7246077	That's my question.
7248018	7248839	That's tasteful.
7249839	7252922	Yeah, because they're calling up legal and they're like, they hang up the phone.
7252942	7253902	They're like, this is hot.
7254703	7255344	I'm going to wait.
7255544	7256685	I'm going to see how this ends.
7258326	7259627	Labor is not hot.
7261588	7263790	No, it's very disgusting.
7265751	7270235	Ranma says, Mario, you are not the father.
7272557	7273738	All right, let's move on, please.
7273978	7274219	Quick.
7274719	7276481	Loki, we need a news story, quick.
7277222	7278523	Something that doesn't involve boobs.
7279223	7280465	And Mario labor.
7280985	7281225	Okay.
7283908	7290795	So, apparently, there's this comment going around from EA Games President Frank...
7291555	7292055	Gabbo.
7293016	7298618	Heath believes that the future of the game industry will come from multiplayer games.
7298978	7311624	It says that EA is very comfortable moving the discussion towards how we make connected gameplay, be it cooperative or multiplayer or online services as opposed to fire and forget package goods only.
7312084	7314385	Single player, 25 hours and you're out.
7315146	7318247	Heath says, I think the model is finished.
7318667	7319628	Yeah, finish for them.
7319728	7336643	Basically, to translate this in layman's speak, he believes that games should have more of an online component, which they charge money for, and also more download content later on so that it extends the gameplay beyond 25 hours, which they charge money for.
7337482	7344025	and, you know, possibly some sort of massive multiplayer online service, which they would also charge more money for.
7344105	7346146	So, basically, who wants to charge more money for stuff?
7347327	7352329	Well, I mean, I hate to say it, but isn't there kind of maybe a hint of truth to this?
7352409	7354310	Like, because, you know, I think about, okay, well...
7355090	7356132	and DarkSakura.com.
7370528	7372990	Was there download content that ever came out on PlayStation 3 for it?
7373030	7373850	I think it was rumored.
7374210	7381916	But besides that, the trophies and the achievements kind of add to this more cohesive multiplayer experience on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
7382317	7393485	Granted, not every gamer is connected on their system, and some people are quite content playing the games by themselves, but even people that don't know how to get their...
7395166	7399690	X-Boxes online and stuff have probably at least played Bejeweled Blitz once in their life, right?
7400051	7400311	Yeah.
7402273	7403794	I just think that... No, I've never played it.
7403914	7410800	Yeah, this is kind of an excuse to say, oh, well, we don't need to worry too much about the single-player experience because people are just going to play the multiplayer experience.
7412101	7414303	And you haven't played Bejeweled Blitz, but you played Knights of the Clicky.
7414844	7415464	It's even worse.
7415845	7416105	Yeah.
7416125	7416205	Yeah.
7417850	7424113	Which, by the way, I know I'm a little early, but F you to Knights of the Clicky, because it just deleted, like, three of my friends the other day.
7424253	7424813	Just like, oh.
7425333	7425733	Really?
7425953	7428734	Like, two of them are friends of mine I talk to every day.
7428875	7430595	Did you have to send a re-invite or something?
7431035	7431996	I didn't try that yet.
7432056	7433236	I was hoping it would fix itself.
7433496	7437718	Well, if they, do you know if they removed the game, like, deleted the game from their own profile?
7437778	7438859	Like, they've had enough.
7438939	7439859	They're getting intervention.
7439939	7440379	Oh, maybe.
7440419	7440939	I don't know.
7440999	7443821	One of them was X-Link, so, X-Link, did you delete the game?
7443881	7444281	What'd you do?
7444821	7445121	I don't know.
7445201	7446823	Yeah, he's still on mine, so that shouldn't happen.
7446843	7447203	No, see?
7448204	7450026	He probably just deleted me from his friends list.
7450146	7453689	He's like, I'm sick of all these vlogs and keyboard cat videos.
7453709	7454990	I'm just deleting Rob from my friends list.
7455030	7456031	That's probably what really happened.
7459194	7461296	Anyhow, now we'll get a phone call later for sure.
7461356	7462417	Oh, Rob, we still love you.
7462617	7463238	Alright, you better.
7464859	7468821	Here's another, speaking of multiplayer, places where multiplayer things are happening.
7468841	7470582	You know, this is the future, Loki.
7470622	7471803	PlayStation Home.
7472284	7475045	I mean, surely, this is what the guy from EA was talking about, right?
7475065	7477507	It was PlayStation Home was where the multiplayer is at.
7477907	7480289	Can you believe PlayStation Home has been out for two years?
7480709	7484851	That's right, a Sony press release came out this week celebrating the second birthday of PlayStation Home.
7485272	7488234	Over 17 million users have visited home.
7489054	7491296	For two minutes, and then they left.
7491316	7491636	I'm sorry.
7491656	7491876	Right.
7492156	7495199	They have participated in over 600 community events.
7495539	7501044	So what that means obviously is collectively those 17 million users played 600 community events.
7503426	7503866	Let's see.
7504527	7507029	Some of them were sponsored by game developers and so on.
7507069	7508290	Some of them were more unofficial.
7508390	7510312	Sodium 2 is coming out next spring.
7512473	7518777	and Conspiracy, a multiplayer spy puzzle game from Jet Set Games is coming out as well.
7519537	7526302	I just want to know when the furry sex lounge is coming out because that's... Let's just call it what it is.
7526462	7528263	I mean, why are we wasting our time?
7528303	7528743	Hello?
7529604	7531224	By the way, I tried to do the DDR thing.
7531245	7531725	Couldn't do it.
7534226	7535047	Home is the future.
7536357	7539218	Now it's time for some of you to visit our home.
7539659	7540279	Not literally.
7540719	7542580	We want you to send us emails and interact with us.
7542960	7546482	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place for you to send us emails.
7546802	7549703	Dark Sakura dives into the email bag every week and reads some emails.
7549743	7554125	This is a great way to interact with us if you don't listen or can't listen live every Sunday night.
7554445	7555486	We always love emails.
7555586	7564570	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com This was the email that was referred to earlier.
7565951	7567953	Hey Sky and DarkSakura, sorry Loki.
7568574	7574200	I don't know if you're able to purchase the WoW games at the moment at the awesome sale prices yet.
7574280	7575962	I didn't see any sale prices by the way.
7576002	7576723	I think it's done.
7577464	7578125	It'll be back.
7578525	7579046	It'll be back.
7579451	7607732	but here is an alternative it sounds like Jamie had a WoW account in the past so if Rob sends her a scroll of resurrection via Blizzard's website then he gets a free month when a month of paid game time is applied to Jamie's account including a 10 day non-restricted free trial Rob can simply buy Jamie a month of a game as a present no games or expansions will have to be purchased and play for 40 days and try out the new old world content just an idea from Horde House's podcast number one fan Flaco Jones
7609218	7610360	Flacco Jones, but that's okay.
7610380	7612503	Yeah, I think it's a great idea.
7612543	7615368	I can't believe I didn't even think of the Scroll of Resurrection, but that's a great idea.
7615488	7617712	The thing is, when was the last time it played?
7619324	7624566	If it was more than two months ago, I think you're eligible Okay Which, you're more than six months out, aren't you?
7624646	7629449	No, I think I'm actually a year out because I got Star Trek Online Didn't I get it last Christmas?
7629729	7642915	I don't know No, I didn't, I got it So, yeah, I think Star Trek Online came out in like February I think the beta test was going on last Christmas Yeah, so I've been playing Star Trek Online since it was in beta That was, Star Trek Online was in beta around the time you and I started dating, right?
7643635	7645616	Yeah, so I think it was last Christmas, so
7646351	7650592	I don't really give a shit about Worgen I'm gonna play a goat chick again
7675666	7676547	The Draenei are awesome, actually.
7676567	7677468	The Draenei were cool.
7677508	7678128	They're really cool.
7678548	7681911	I think they are probably the most underrated class in WoW, next to Dwarves.
7681931	7682732	It was my favorite.
7682892	7683072	Yeah.
7683493	7686675	Except that, you know, my whole problem, okay, here's what the problem I ran into was.
7687176	7690599	When I hit level 20, I was like, what the fuck do I do now?
7691760	7696444	I'm on, I'm off the island, I'm on this place on a boat, I'm on a boat!
7697044	7699827	In fact, I think I remember actually standing out and shouting, I'm on a boat.
7700627	7701728	But I don't know what to do now.
7701769	7702810	I don't know where anyone is.
7702830	7704251	I don't know what anyone's doing.
7705693	7714402	The only issue you would have is that the Draenei and the Blood Elf starting areas were the only areas that weren't changed with this new expansion.
7714743	7716785	So it's still on the same quests and everything.
7717406	7719408	But I have a level 20 Draenei already.
7719688	7720309	Oh, I guess that's true.
7720709	7721170	and DarkSakura.com.
7741505	7742346	I kind of dig that.
7742406	7747751	I mean, that's one of the things that I really, really like about Star Trek Online is that, first of all, I can play.
7749112	7753957	Except for playing a few things with some of my fleet friends, I've done all of my leveling myself.
7755057	7756878	I've done all my missions myself.
7757739	7766304	I like the missions because it's like, okay, well, you do this, oh no, this leads to this thing, and it's all in the same area.
7767145	7771488	My favorite mission that I've done to date is the one that I said was Silent Hill.
7772228	7783456	were, it's the stupid, most stupid next generation bad guys was the Davidians, the ones that were the psychic leeches that were just slightly out of phase with reality.
7784196	7785297	These blue glowing creatures.
7785957	7791401	And they figured a way back in, you have to go in the past, you have to go in the present, but they've screwed up the electronics in this old
7792081	7792982	Thanks for watching!
7803005	7808327	That was my favorite, but you get to this one point, and then you hear the voice, and another thing happens.
7808907	7814709	And that's why I like this, something that builds and builds and builds on top of each other, which is what I wasn't really getting out of World of Warcraft before.
7814909	7815849	Well, it's settled.
7815889	7824392	I'm going to get DarkSakura a 60-day WoW card as a Christmaka gift, and then it's a win-win situation because I won't have to hear as much Star Trek nerd chat on this show.
7825813	7826133	Hearts.
7827173	7830276	I was using it as a basis of comparison.
7830336	7833158	I give you shit because that's what I've been doing for the past nine years.
7833618	7833838	I know.
7834258	7836900	But my point is that that's the type of missions I like.
7836980	7840182	And if there's stuff like that now in World of Warcraft, because honestly, there really wasn't.
7841103	7844986	There was... It was like, okay, you take this... Kill deer and skin their corpses.
7845928	7847329	Yeah, that was really it.
7847629	7851092	But only one in every six deer has a skin, apparently.
7851512	7851852	Yeah.
7852533	7853834	Which they fixed that.
7854454	7860098	Whereas, if I have a scanning mission, it's beam to the planet, scan five of these items.
7860518	7861079	You're done.
7861519	7864541	And you run up to the items and you just scan them.
7865462	7866002	And that's it.
7866803	7868924	And I call those my free XP ones.
7869364	7870545	Oh, look at the pretty textures.
7871106	7871606	You know, things.
7871926	7874128	Ramma is starting the You Sold Out chants.
7874748	7877791	Tigerclaw says it's an excuse to get DarkSakura on Horde House.
7878571	7883355	And Deathwishing says, crack, Rob's buying Sakura a crack to get a free hit of crack.
7885343	7893410	And again, keep in mind, there's no guarantee I'll stick with it again because I am on Star Trek Online.
7893831	7894671	I'm in a fleet.
7894771	7896172	I play with Scottish men.
7897053	7898414	I love playing with my Scottish dudes.
7898514	7901517	Yes, but if you come to WoW, you can be in a guild full of gay men.
7902578	7903779	Oh, that is fantastic.
7904079	7904640	I don't know.
7904700	7906601	What wins, Scottish or gay?
7907242	7909764	Now, if I had Scottish gay, I would... Ewan McGregor.
7910144	7912466	Well, he's not gay, but he's there to dream.
7912686	7913267	That would be hot.
7915682	7917223	I went to my status screen.
7918023	7923224	My internal status screen now is going blink, blink, blink, blink because I just imagined Scottish and gay.
7923264	7925344	Do we have any gay Scots that listen to the show?
7925384	7926624	Please email us immediately.
7926704	7928245	DarkSakura wants to be your friend.
7928645	7929625	Send me voicemail.
7930545	7932405	My number is 555-4444.
7932905	7934546	All right.
7934606	7935566	Next email.
7938727	7939827	Ooh, Scottish and gay.
7939847	7940567	That's just hot.
7940707	7940927	Anyway.
7943386	7959746	um oh uh thought I'd bring to your attention an interesting BBC commentary airing the UK this evening while you won't be able to see it on iPlayer in the US I'm certain you'll be able to acquire it after airing courtesy of the torrential deluge of data sharing I see what you did there
7961226	7985118	I love it the link will direct you to an interview conducted by Eurogamer with the director of the show following an exclusive preview screening I'm going to pull up the article in a second it might be worth bringing the issues raised to a wider global audience although I'm sure like me your stance on this and the implications such issues placed on personal responsibility will remain unchanged keep up the good work, Nigel let me see what the article is
7988204	7992578	Every time I see the name Nigel, that XTC song goes into my head.
7992999	7993802	Making plans for Nigel.
7995792	7996573	I don't follow.
7996613	7997794	Didn't you listen to XTC?
7997974	8001337	No.
8002398	8002778	Let's see.
8003018	8007402	The article says... Oh, it's about video games being addictive.
8009663	8011205	I'm just going to quote this a little bit.
8011565	8021113	We spoke to director and producer Emike Onono about why Panorama chose to highlight the issue and thinks the industry should be less defensive about it.
8022874	8023154	Okay.
8023814	8028237	Leo22 played World of Warcraft for 12 hours per day for two years and calls it a disease.
8031358	8032319	That was your problem, dude.
8032779	8033019	Anyway.
8034220	8034840	Another email.
8035581	8036421	By the way, thank you, Nigel.
8037402	8038302	Give us a call sometime.
8038823	8039523	Leave us a voicemail.
8040524	8042024	What is going on with Shenmue 3?
8042164	8043265	Is there actually one coming out?
8043385	8043765	Thanks.
8044146	8046307	And this comes from Jesus.
8047768	8050209	J-E-Z-U-S How do you know it's not Jesus?
8050928	8051909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8070188	8071590	What is going on with Shenmue 3?
8071630	8072691	Is there one actually coming out?
8072812	8073052	Thanks.
8073172	8074954	On mobile phones in Japan.
8075015	8076316	I think there's like a Shenmue 3.
8076376	8078980	But otherwise, it's just a fanboy dream.
8079040	8079941	Keep on dreaming.
8079981	8080922	Keep hope alive.
8081403	8082805	And he emailed twice.
8083105	8083826	Nothing official.
8084027	8085248	No more Jesus.
8085449	8086310	I'm sorry, Jesus.
8088223	8088743	I'm Jewish.
8088963	8089283	Click.
8089504	8093445	If Jesus can't use his divine will to put it out, then it's never happening.
8093465	8095366	Because it's not divine.
8095566	8101228	Jesus should be able to take some extra copies of Final Fantasy XIV and turn them into Shenmue 3, right?
8102392	8103793	We're gonna get so much hate mail this week.
8103813	8105934	Is that like the water and the wine sort of?
8106174	8107434	It's all in good fun.
8107514	8110616	If you can't laugh it yourself, what can you laugh?
8110636	8111737	Get the tree trunk out of your ass.
8111777	8112477	No, come on.
8112537	8112977	Have fun.
8113657	8114458	Just teasing.
8115098	8116079	Just have a little fun.
8116099	8117659	I'm gonna get some wow.
8117980	8121201	I'm gonna get some... I feel rub.
8121681	8122442	I feel funny.
8123382	8123982	I feel dirty.
8124683	8126684	It'll burn for a couple days, but then it goes away.
8126924	8127764	My arm is itching.
8127984	8129125	Let's go to the FUs of the week.
8146098	8170273	I had a bunch of FUs leading up into something, but the only thing that I'm actually remotely bitter about, and it's more of a, wow, how could you think this, and it's completely shallow, so pardon me for being completely shallow, but, and again, I don't want to say FU this, because it's one of my friends, and I thought it was a really sweet gesture, but I don't wear a 3XL.
8173422	8173842	Uh-ohs.
8174903	8177704	That's like girl drama right there.
8178044	8181906	That's like asking a girl if she's pregnant.
8182547	8183067	Don't do that.
8183207	8184968	I don't even wear an XL.
8185968	8188169	My t-shirt size is large.
8189150	8193412	The only XL I wear is if I buy boys t-shirts because I have the rack of days.
8195842	8201567	You know, and the other thing, too, okay, this is kind of a long, drawn-out story, and I'm not going to go into it, and I completely misunderstood what my friend said.
8201588	8208974	Okay, one of my friends on Facebook was feeling angry because someone verbally belittled her for what she was wearing to an event.
8209695	8211997	And she said she was thinking, well, at least I have children and you don't.
8213218	8221026	Now, I thought it was, because, you know, I've been trying, I thought it was, okay, is that all the value a woman has?
8221530	8223392	What the hell kind of response is that to?
8223773	8225235	I have children and you don't.
8225415	8230181	She went back and explained it to me that it's, I have to pay for my children.
8230261	8232203	You don't have to pay for any children.
8232944	8234086	I have expenses that you don't.
8234646	8236188	I have responsibilities that you don't.
8236989	8237750	That's what she meant.
8238610	8240952	I didn't see it that way because I've been a little bitter.
8243374	8246057	Damn you, uterus.
8247918	8257046	One of her friends started going in three all caps locked posts, by the way, about, I've adopted all these children and I've had the court waive my costs and everything.
8257186	8261850	I was like, dude, what are you doing adopting children if you can't freaking afford them?
8262330	8269874	That's almost as bad, I mean, I guess you're trying to do something good, but, you know, and my response to her was, I don't care.
8270554	8271335	You're not my friend.
8272915	8275257	The person who made the first post, she's my friend.
8275677	8276277	You are not.
8276797	8277698	This isn't about you.
8278058	8280959	And so when I went to check on it an hour later, all of those posts were deleted.
8281320	8282940	Facebook, serious business.
8283181	8287723	But I'm saying, I'm saying, it's just like, that's leading up to this FU.
8288663	8291645	Nobody needs to know your personal shit.
8292577	8293638	We don't care.
8293938	8295459	If you're not our friend, we don't care.
8296921	8302085	Saying all of this stuff to make yourself be all holier than thou just makes you look bitchier than thou.
8302806	8303186	The end.
8305047	8306349	I like that, bitchier than thou.
8306469	8307469	That should be my drag name.
8308010	8308290	All right.
8309491	8311233	Loki, do you have any... Oh, where'd the FU music go?
8311413	8311853	It went away.
8312113	8313254	Loki, do you have FU music?
8313915	8315256	Or FUs to go with the music?
8316139	8317099	Uh, yeah, F.E.
8317119	8322944	the Comcast for having to put a new drop to our house, which is gonna take ten days.
8323865	8327568	Basically, it's the line that goes from the cable box out front to my house.
8328729	8334214	That's the one that's messed up, so I don't have internet for that much longer.
8334614	8343859	Thankfully, though, I have hacked my phone to be able to Wi-Fi tether to it, so I've had slow internet, but I'd rather have fast internet.
8344219	8348122	I also bought a DOCSIS 3 modem now, so it should be even faster when I do get it working.
8349883	8350203	That's it.
8351624	8352844	I don't have a whole lot actually.
8352965	8369235	My FUs are pretty, you know, just FU to not having enough money to take any extravagant holiday trips because I'm going to have an entire week off of work this year just due to situations and, you know, just me having extra PTO and them encouraging me to take it basically.
8370016	8371917	So I might have a whole week off and nowhere to go.
8372518	8373999	So FU to that fact.
8374039	8376340	I mean, there might be other things going on that will definitely take my time.
8376740	8380463	But FU to getting old and not having trips to take.
8381724	8383104	Salacious Pop, do you have any FUs?
8384245	8395550	FUs to buying something digitally and then not having it post to your banking until like seven days later and kind of screwing up the mental math of how much money you thought you had.
8396130	8401494	When you're on employment on a fixed budget and you expect something that you buy to just show up the next day.
8402754	8411040	And also F you to just playing a new type of social game and just be nervous about being inexperienced.
8412307	8412687	All right.
8413288	8415370	How about our KDM42?
8415450	8416811	Do you have any FUs?
8417732	8424058	FU to dry air and winter and how it makes my skin get all itchy and crappy and it's always sucky.
8424679	8428342	And FU to being behind on everything just because of work and all that kind of stuff.
8429223	8429643	All right.
8432586	8433307	FU to the winter.
8434488	8434949	I don't know.
8435069	8436210	Winter can be okay sometimes.
8436690	8439834	I don't like the changes my body goes through either.
8441115	8441436	All right.
8441856	8444599	Loki and myself have one more story a piece for you guys.
8444619	8447862	Then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8448163	8450165	But first, a couple quick stories for you guys.
8450605	8458068	What we were alluding to earlier when we were talking to Bobby and also, I think we may have made this joke during the show.
8459069	8466352	Apparently, a Cypress Hill backup singer is suing rock star Take-Two over Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
8467233	8468074	Yes, that's right.
8469476	8482594	Apparently, back in the day I guess, Michael Shag Washington, he I guess spoke with the developer and stuff about his troubled youth.
8485216	8499144	He claims that he met with Rockstar in 2003 to talk to them about his street life for their upcoming game, including a description of his troubled youth and specifics of how the teenagers in his gang rode around on bicycles.
8501805	8503086	Apparently he's saying...
8504778	8512722	He didn't even know that he's never seen San Andreas in action until July when his nephew was playing it.
8512742	8516304	The plaintiff had never seen the game.
8516364	8518865	He did not own or play video games.
8519766	8531692	The complaint admits, further explained upon examination of the images of CJ in comparison with his photo from that year and other evidence, it became clear that Rockstar had stolen his image and never paid him.
8532612	8541222	So now he's claiming he was asking for 25% of the profits from San Andreas, which were approximately $250 million.
8541562	8545427	So $75 million of that, I guess.
8546348	8549251	And Take-Two, of course, is saying that the case is completely without merit.
8550293	8557855	Now, part of me goes, like, crazy guy is very crazy, and I think we can all agree, this can't be based on his real life.
8557955	8564636	If this was his real life, having sex with hookers and then shooting him in the face, I mean, he'd be dead from the state.
8564816	8566556	The state would have executed him years ago.
8566756	8572638	You know, I'm sorry, but he wasn't the only person, I'm sure, that was in a gang that rode around on a bicycle.
8572938	8574378	I mean, come on.
8575500	8580049	And I don't think, you know, and I like how he says, oh, well, the character looked like me.
8580598	8584499	Well, the character can look like whatever you want because you can customize your character in the game.
8585339	8595583	Here's the other interesting thing is that, I mean, he claims that he filed the lawsuit and so he must, this meeting he had with Rockstar must not be fake.
8595663	8597483	Like, that must have actually happened, right?
8597763	8602105	Because otherwise it would be really stupid to file a lawsuit and that can easily be disproved that Rockstar never met with him.
8602605	8608787	But I wonder, like, maybe Rockstar met with a bunch of people and this is just like, it's called doing research.
8609227	8609387	Yeah.
8610310	8611311	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8630976	8631276	It does.
8631536	8633537	And it's also, like, too late.
8634237	8635778	Isn't there, like, a statute of limitations?
8635818	8636318	I guess not.
8636798	8637399	Eh, probably not.
8638599	8643421	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, If the game is based on his life, then so is the hot coffee, if you know what I mean.
8643721	8645262	I don't think it's based on his life at all.
8645282	8648003	I mean, it doesn't sound like his meeting was in great detail.
8648243	8649244	It's fiction.
8649464	8651044	It was based on no one's life.
8652125	8652985	It's like when...
8655794	8664736	A person is going to play a wrestler in a movie so that person hangs out with other wrestlers to kind of know what a wrestler's life is like.
8665056	8670437	That doesn't mean that you model your character directly after somebody, right?
8670817	8671717	Don't they do this shit?
8671757	8674698	Don't actors do this shit all the time in movies, right?
8675458	8676719	Method acting.
8677099	8678399	I wouldn't think it's that much different.
8679594	8687840	Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and it has to do with something we reported on previously, an 8-bit remake of DJ Hero that was out there on the internet.
8688280	8691683	It has been taken down from the official website.
8691743	8692003	Why?
8692063	8695846	Because of a cease and desist letter from Universal Music Publishing Group.
8696086	8704853	There was a little bit of back and forth going between the creator, Eric Ruth, and the Universal Music Publishing Group, and you can read the whole exchange over at what...
8705373	8707315	PeakyMall.com, Blog.
8707615	8709056	It's PeakyGeek, whatever this is.
8709756	8714420	And the whole little exchange really strikes me as kind of unprofessional.
8714800	8717002	And I don't see any signatures in it.
8717963	8718323	I don't know.
8718623	8722026	I read this and I go, part of it reads like fanfic to me, but whatever.
8723667	8725488	For whatever reason, the game is now gone.
8725608	8727289	I mean, but you know what they say.
8727609	8730210	Once it hits the internet, it's always on the internet.
8730510	8733871	So it's not like you can't find this thing on torrent sites and so forth.
8734211	8741354	And honestly, the news about it getting taken down probably just makes more people want to download it because, ha, I have the file I'm not supposed to have.
8741914	8744795	It's just like why WikiLeaks is such a big deal.
8745496	8746756	Not to get on another tangent.
8747036	8749337	But people just like to have shit they're not supposed to have.
8749757	8750438	That's what it is.
8750518	8751158	It's EPing.
8752122	8769209	Anyhow, another interesting twist in the story, and Dark Tetsuya had mentioned this in our mod forum, and sure enough, it's either a heck of a coincidence, Eric Ruth is the real name of an artist that used to do Bomani-related things named DJ Potato, with an E.
8770149	8772510	And I can't remember if we ever had him on this show.
8772590	8773610	I don't think we did.
8773990	8778991	But I remember we banned one of his songs from the old station because it was so, so terrible.
8779631	8781752	And you'll just have to Google it if you want to find out about that.
8781772	8784853	But it's kind of funny that now and then, where are they now?
8785353	8787073	Barmani people five years later.
8787093	8788714	I don't know if that's the same Eric Ruth, though.
8788754	8788974	I know.
8789014	8791074	I'm thinking it's kind of a common name.
8791594	8793375	But then I go, well, games.
8793875	8794475	But I don't know.
8796547	8800989	Did DarkTetsuya have something else to show that or is that just a coinkydink?
8801910	8804191	Do I need to email DJ Potato and be like, is this you?
8804211	8805312	Is this you, brah?
8805832	8806252	Is this you?
8807293	8807653	We'll see.
8808430	8810652	So I'll have to see if there's anything else that comes out on that.
8810692	8812573	But otherwise, kind of interesting.
8812854	8814695	Where are they now, Bomani people?
8814975	8820300	Oh, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky are still doing that little podcast they started years ago.
8820440	8822681	And we had Iguana Girl on here a few weeks ago.
8823022	8824163	I know we've been talking about episode 400.
8824203	8827405	We're going to get a whole lot of the old people together.
8827425	8828026	That would be fun.
8828286	8829727	By the way, that's only seven weeks away.
8830648	8832369	We might want to start planning that.
8832389	8833150	Yeah.
8836744	8837825	Alright, that's it for the news.
8838485	8838906	We're done.
8839306	8840426	Let's go to the Skype line.
8840446	8845469	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8845649	8846449	All one word.
8846469	8851012	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8851032	8853093	The Skype line is now open for business.
8855126	8858971	and DarkTetsuya says it was in the readme.
8859192	8862176	It says DJ Potato with an E in the readme file.
8862977	8864739	So it is the same guy.
8864859	8865861	That's proof enough to me.
8867310	8867850	Interesting.
8869332	8869632	All right.
8870132	8872074	Maybe we should get him on the show.
8872154	8872594	I don't know.
8872674	8877157	But then I'm worried the topic of old songs will come up and then it'll get really awkward.
8877858	8878158	All right.
8879239	8881440	Solar Flare, we're not doing a marathon for episode 400.
8882141	8882601	Dream on.
8882661	8883722	All right.
8883742	8884663	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8884763	8885844	Use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8885864	8886804	We have a call coming in right now.
8887225	8888085	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8888105	8888385	Who's this?
8889066	8889846	This is X-Link.
8890087	8890587	Hi, X-Link.
8890607	8891207	What's on your mind, buddy?
8891227	8891868	You should know me.
8892248	8894590	I'm your friend from Facebook that didn't defriend you.
8895322	8901310	Well, apparently you somehow have left my circle of Knights of the Clicky friends, so I don't know what happened.
8902060	8910867	It's probably because I've been inactive because of a certain other clicky game that we're all too familiar with because we're also all in another guild called WoW.
8911307	8911647	I see.
8912288	8916891	So when WoW, when Kata came out, I kind of like totally abandoned all my Facebook games for a while.
8917351	8923296	But I'm pretty sure I have people on my Facebook who haven't played that game but the first time they ever played it.
8923656	8925577	Like did Marissa ever play past one day?
8925757	8926438	I doubt she did.
8927657	8928118	I don't know.
8943595	8944736	No, no, no, no, I do.
8944836	8945477	I seriously do.
8945497	8959389	It's just there's a lot going on, and I really prefer us getting all the little guild perks and stuff so we can get our 50% or 60% bonuses when we start killing stuff than, you know, playing Knights of the Clique and getting you a broadsword.
8959849	8964974	Alright, so I have to ask, how's Warcraft Cataclysm going for you since it was the big game release this week?
8965680	8968204	Well, it's going good since you got me addicted to it.
8969185	8969646	It was fine.
8969746	8978299	I went out and I always wanted to be in one of those lines during the midnight launching of something, so I decided to go see how it was.
8978439	8979441	It was very interesting.
8981578	8989825	It was very intriguing to see all the people QQing and cussing, I can't get in, what the fuck, and what the hell's going on?
8990606	8999713	It was just funny hearing the people bitch and moan for the first four or five hours of trying to get into the game and they can't get in and trying to become the first of different professions.
8999893	9001695	It was over in like ten minutes.
9001955	9006659	We ran Blackrock Caverns before 1am, but we were prepared to go.
9008157	9008717	You know what I mean?
9008998	9015061	There was a group of like five of us that we had emailed earlier in the day and it was like, okay, we're going to be outside the entrance to the dungeon at 11.59pm.
9015122	9026569	And then you're the one who, you're the one on your other podcast that went off and saying, talking about how I told you guys that you had to log out and you guys, you didn't really believe me at first.
9026589	9035975	And I'm like, yeah, there was a blue post that specifically stated if you're in game by the time that thing rolled around that you have to actually log out and then re-log back in.
9036335	9038197	Did you flip a magic switch like it's the cable company?
9058695	9073330	yeah well so anyway yeah but it whatever I mean yeah it was 10 minutes of nerd rage but then it was over and we were doing our quest it was fine but then you guys were doing your dungeons while I'm doing the new profession so
9073700	9074701	How is archaeology?
9074741	9075882	That's something I haven't even touched yet.
9075922	9080706	Archaeology is loads of fun, but it's very tedious and time-consuming.
9081427	9084950	It's because you jump from place to place to place, and they're all random.
9085030	9090755	So you could go halfway to the bottom of the continent and then have to fly all the way up to the top for another dig site.
9090875	9098281	So it can take a little bit, but supposedly there's going to be mounts and other items and pets.
9098361	9099582	I got, like, two pets so far.
9099602	9101084	I didn't get any of the mounts yet.
9102024	9104405	Alright, we'll see what happens.
9104565	9108327	Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
9108367	9108547	X-Link.
9132426	9135988	No, Dad, I'm one of the few people in your guild that's not gay, but that's okay.
9136568	9137409	I still love you anyways.
9137729	9140271	You can still fake a Scottish accent pretty good, right?
9140931	9141451	No, I cannot.
9142712	9143572	You're not even going to try?
9144213	9145454	No, not at all.
9145994	9147555	You're no fun at all, just so you know.
9148355	9148976	I'm sorry.
9149556	9153278	I just can't do a Scottish accent, that's all.
9154058	9160022	I understand you're not gay and you're very happy with your girlfriend and you're very secure and all that stuff, but you do like musicals, right?
9161038	9165199	Loki, do you have any last minute stories while we're waiting for the phone to ring?
9186230	9191514	TurboGrafx-16 emulation is coming to the iPod and iPhone.
9192175	9197459	They're going to be doing something similar to the Commodore 64 client that's out there.
9197539	9205867	It says you're going to get the actual emulator, which will come with Olympic-style World Sports Competition.
9207788	9219975	for free, and then each day Hudson will select one game from the library and make it available through the app for a free three-minute trial, and each individual game will be available for $3.99.
9220015	9221996	All right, let me go back to the phone.
9222036	9223056	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9223076	9223437	Who's this?
9224637	9225438	Deathwishing.
9225918	9226798	Deathwishing.
9226858	9227819	What's on your mind, Deathwishing?
9229120	9232762	Besides being really tired because I rode 60 miles on my bike.
9233542	9235223	Wait, why'd you ride 60 miles on your bike?
9236411	9237651	because I'm working out.
9237771	9239512	I want to have big, huge quads.
9239992	9240312	I see.
9240332	9241573	Oh, you got to impress the ladies?
9243433	9244874	Yes, with my massive meaty legs.
9244894	9245554	Yeah, sure, whatever.
9245734	9246034	I see.
9246154	9247295	You got to have beefcake legs.
9247375	9248055	All right, that's fine.
9249115	9251936	All right, well, good luck with the bike riding.
9252037	9252857	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
9254057	9256098	What the hell is up with this grand shrivel?
9256178	9258219	I was at my friend's house.
9258259	9264661	I'm playing it, and I realized 200 cars are ungodly beautiful, and you can take pictures of them.
9265151	9287650	and it's almost like that's all the game is good for is taking pictures of cars and like wanking but I know it's like I'm going through 200 cars list and like wow these are beautiful all of a sudden I get to this one car and it looks like Playstation 1 it's like they made this great game and so the game is like a burger and then the bacon that's supposed to be wrapped around it is like 3 weeks old
9289344	9290364	Interesting analogy.
9291105	9299987	Do you think maybe possibly, I know this might be hard to believe, but do you think maybe a game company rushed the game to get it out at a certain time?
9300007	9312751	I mean, I know we didn't just have a story on that earlier in the evening, but do you think maybe they rushed this car and just made it out of triangles and basic shapes to get it in there?
9313251	9316572	I think they just got fed up with all these, like, oh, we have to push it back.
9316632	9317592	Oh, we gotta push it back.
9317632	9317912	We, uh,
9318348	9319929	messed up on a tire thing.
9319989	9323731	Our developer, he's a neat freak and he keeps on trying to make the cars look beautiful.
9323751	9327373	Then soon they're just like, fuck it, we'll make it so you can drive a go-kart backwards and win a race.
9327773	9332896	You know what would be awesome is that if Gran Turismo had more of a sense of humor and they put some funny cars in the game.
9333957	9338119	For instance, how about an old covered wagon with oxen could actually be one of the cars.
9338139	9341721	You have a river that you're trying to Ford to get across.
9342182	9343242	That could be an awesome car.
9343362	9346284	How about just one of those little Barbie jeeps?
9346664	9350707	Yes, a Barbie Jeep or a Flintstone car where the guys are running to get it to go.
9350727	9355911	I remember one of the old Need for Speed games had a bunch of different codes you could put in to race as different things.
9355971	9359433	And one of the things that they had, like a lot of them were background objects.
9359553	9361014	Like you could race as a log.
9361314	9363396	You could race as a T-Rex statue.
9364016	9365737	We used to have log races all the time.
9365797	9366898	It was awesome.
9367218	9373163	Or a log with the T-Rex chasing after you and like meter made cars and all sorts of crazy shit.
9373923	9376064	or we can race as the horse in Daytona.
9376164	9376864	Wait, I have a question.
9376884	9379865	When you would do the log races, would you actually all sing this song?
9397085	9398926	How could this song not wake you up?
9399767	9401208	I'm gonna put this on my alarm clock.
9401528	9403330	Wait, here's my favorite part.
9403370	9403930	Oh my god.
9413382	9416104	The only good cake song is the You Are A Pirate song.
9443430	9444871	I don't know the You Are A Pirate song.
9445291	9445952	Yes, you do.
9446052	9449755	The one that was a little... Do what you want because a pirate is free.
9449815	9451576	Do what you want because a pirate is free.
9451616	9452937	You are a pirate.
9453317	9454959	And it had the little dancing part in the middle.
9457681	9460483	That girl was like a 4chan loli icon, just saying.
9461112	9465855	I think this is the song I should put on my email client now when I get new emails.
9465995	9470598	That guy's like a D-list celebrity now.
9470618	9473780	They get pictures of him out and about in LA.
9473800	9476321	He has a fucking shirt at Hot Topic now.
9486187	9487488	Oh, I'm kind of like a mindfuck right now.
9487508	9487588	What?
9509788	9514832	Hide your wife, hide your kids, and hide your husband too, because they're raping everybody on out here.
9514872	9515873	He's raping everybody.
9517634	9518154	Have a good one.
9518194	9522237	Oh, by the way, if you're looking up songs like that, look up the Best Cry Ever autotune remix.
9523178	9525180	Is that the one that was on Saturday Night Live?
9525200	9530183	No, it's this video of this guy from that show, like Intervention or something, and he cries.
9530223	9534967	He's like, They parodied that on Saturday Night Live, didn't they?
9535247	9536088	Wait, hold on, hold on.
9536108	9537248	I think they did a parody of it.
9539213	9540594	Oh my god, what have I done?
9540614	9567543	Because I know, somewhere deep down in my heart That's what it is I still love you I still love you It's so sad but so funny
9570293	9574937	This guy seriously has a problem, but it's like, how do you cry like that?
9577219	9577659	I don't know.
9577860	9578340	Alright.
9578520	9579261	But hold on, wait, wait.
9579281	9580402	Someone needs their own call time.
9580902	9589669	Okay, that's fine, but I know this has nothing to do with video games, but I just wanted to say the best clip from Intervention, however, that they made was this.
9590170	9591371	It wasn't the autotune, it was this.
9591391	9592832	This program contains subject...
9599641	9601542	This is the best clip to ever come from Intervention.
9601562	9603423	I'm walking on sunshine.
9620816	9624158	Thank you for bringing the level of the show down tonight.
9624178	9626019	We really needed it, Deathwishing.
9626280	9630222	Okay, my IQ level dropped to like 50 now from all this.
9630622	9631963	Alright, well congratulations.
9632524	9633985	Alright, this story has a happy end.
9634405	9635906	Alright, bye Deathwishing.

9644431	9645072	I want it back.
9646598	9647838	Who stole my OLR?
9648558	9654660	You're the one that went looking up the other intervention video, Rob.

9762698	9767121	If there's flea markets and auctions, a lot of times you can find old stuff there.
9768261	9771423	I don't know if you would actually find Commodore 64 games.
9771463	9773224	Those are really hard to find now.
9773924	9793782	whoever never do business on eBay with Trader Dan because he will rip you the fuck off keep in mind there's still a lot of Commodore 64 community out there you might even be able to find like a cartridge that has like a USB thing in the back like I don't even know like how these things there's got to be ways that you can get because I know there's a huge modding community out there
9794162	9794883	Delta Patrol

9887946	9895252	Counter 64s are so awesome, but damn Loki bringing logic into this and this whole like, well, you can't make five and a quarter floppies anymore.
9896253	9896713	Yes, you can.
9896993	9897254	All right.
9897754	9898635	Well, yeah, thrift store.
9898655	9898995	That's right.
9899395	9903038	I might even, hell, if I could find my drive, I would just send it to Ziba.
9903159	9903979	I would just be like, you know what?
9903999	9905420	You've listened to the show long enough.
9905601	9907042	Let's just, congratulations.
9907062	9907482	You're a winner.
9907522	9908083	Here's a prize.
9908203	9909584	If I could find it, but I can't.
9910802	9912344	I'd wonder what Windows would do with that.
9912364	9913365	I'd be like, no.
9914166	9914306	No.
9915867	9916668	No.
9916748	9922995	We're going to close up the Skype line for now and get some other last minute stories here and then we're going to wrap it up for tonight because it's already midnight on the East Coast.
9923035	9924857	So do you have any other stories for us, Loki?
9925989	9927170	Yeah, just real quick.
9927891	9936758	Wolfenstein 3D, they've recreated it in LittleBigPlanet 2 using the really incredible creation engine.
9936818	9938219	I mean, it's just amazing the stuff.
9938319	9941662	Someone actually built a ray casting engine within LittleBigPlanet 2.
9943203	9944463	I saw the video of that.
9944603	9950704	And even though it kind of looks junky, just the fact that they pulled it off is amazing.
9950784	9955145	The fact that they pulled off a recasting engine, yeah, it's just nuts.
9955745	9959006	So that's going to be an awesome game when it comes out.
9959666	9960246	Only a month away.
9960446	9961046	Actually, a few weeks.
9962747	9963267	That's awesome.
9963487	9964067	I can't wait to play.
9964307	9964607	That's it.
9965447	9965847	That's it?
9966367	9967487	That's all I want to talk about.
9967507	9968648	All right, that's fine.
9969048	9970708	Any other last-minute stories from anyone else in the studio?
9971502	9976045	Alright, well then this is the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up for the night.
9976345	9978786	Arcadian42, since you're holding the mic, thank you for being here.
9978866	9981588	I hope you had fun laughing along with us and reminiscing about some Sega.
9981608	9983529	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9984530	9985690	Uh, Delta Patrol.
9986171	9988352	If you ever find it, it's awesome.
9988872	9992454	Hopefully someone has it on YouTube or find a soundtrack at least if you can.
9992754	9993895	I'm sure it's on YouTube somewhere.
9994235	9999058	Well, I don't know something that long, but if you find it, it's a pretty cool soundtrack.
10003103	10004184	I'm trying to look right now.
10007226	10008287	No, but I found some chicks.
10008347	10010248	My Twilight soundtrack redone.
10010789	10012490	I don't know what that has to do with Delta Patrol.
10012570	10012990	There you go.
10013090	10013370	All right.
10014251	10016933	Salacious Pop, thank you as always for being here in the studio.
10016973	10017613	Appreciate it.
10017633	10019775	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10020836	10022297	Everyone send me employment vibes.
10024769	10026311	I don't know how you do that.
10027272	10027532	Alright.
10028734	10029034	Let's see.
10029134	10029735	I'll go next.
10029835	10035322	My final thought is man, I wish pink berries were open this late because I could use some fro-yo.
10036143	10039407	DarkSakura and her knitting self over there.
10039427	10040147	I'm crocheting.
10040688	10043011	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10043951	10048794	This silk bamboo yarn is really fucking difficult to use and really tiny.
10049134	10053217	And I wish that my friend had picked out a thicker yarn for me to make her scarf out of.
10053277	10054237	But it's silk bamboo.
10054797	10055338	It is really nice.
10055378	10056078	It was on sale too.
10056578	10056839	All right.
10056899	10058820	And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.
10060475	10083242	my final thought is I wish my internet was backup I can't even imagine like thank gosh you have a baby to entertain you because like if you didn't have that I don't know what you know thank god I have my phone that I can you know tag onto the Wi-Fi for that and at least browse the internet downloading is out of the picture but browsing the internet is at least tolerable with that
10084332	10087033	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10087093	10088434	We will be back next week.
10088514	10094998	I can't remember if the conversation was on or off air, but there was a thought that we might not be here next week, but we are going to be here next week.
10095018	10095798	That was all worked out.
10095838	10097059	So we're going to be back next week.
10097919	10099800	We're creeping closer to the year end.
10099940	10102561	Actually, next week will be our last show before Christmas.
10102822	10104522	No, there will be one more show before Christmas.
10105823	10107564	I can't do math.
10107744	10113147	Next week is the last show before Christmas, and then I will be out of town after that.
10113487	10113867	DarkSakura
10139258	10140319	That remains to be seen.
10140619	10140859	Wow.
10140959	10144142	Because Dan really wants to go to Washington to see the family.
10144262	10144683	Sure, sure.
10145263	10148446	But I can say no need to go back.
10148706	10151108	So last week will be the last OLR.
