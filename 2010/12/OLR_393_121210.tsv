0	20040	Tonight, December 12, 2010, a high-profile PlayStation 3 game gets a big delay, Australia
20040	46160	debates a new video game rating, and more rumors leak about
46160	50880	chat rooms at chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you
50880	57840	with my co-host, Dark Sakura. Jamie Summers. Hi. How are you? Productive. Productive. That's
57840	65240	good. Productive Jamie is happy Jamie, right? Sort of. I'm being paid for it, so. Hey, money.
65240	72080	Yay, money. Yeah, and I'm going into finals week, so. Good times. Yeah. All right. Well,
72080	82280	good luck with all that crap. Say hello. Okay, if 2x plus 9 equals y, I forget it. All right.
82280	88000	I could actually rewrite that five million different ways now. Solve for kitten. The
88000	93080	answer is shirmy. Can't divide by kitten, unfortunately. Hi, Loki. How are you? Techmaster
93080	98120	Loki joins us here every week with his witty insight. How are you, Loki? Good, and you
98120	104640	divide by kitten. Is that, it's like zero. You can't mix the kitten with anti-kitten.
104640	109200	Not unless kitten is radical. Oh, it's gonna be one of those shows tonight. It's just not
109200	115320	gonna make any sense at all. Also, say hello. We have some guests. It's like plural in studio
115320	119580	tonight, and I'm gonna introduce them here. Since he has the mic, I will say hello to
119580	124640	Salacious Pop. Hello. Hi, how are you? I'm great, how are you? I am well, thanks for
124640	129520	asking. Except for the fact that, you know, it's Sunday night, and then once this whole,
129520	132800	this whole shtick is over, it's back to the work week, you know. Yeah, and you have to
132800	137040	be at work at like 7, 730 for a while now, up until the holidays. Yeah, and I'm just
137040	140160	not a morning person. You know, I really like my job, don't get me wrong, but it's just
140160	144160	one of those, like, you know, oh, getting used to the new schedule's really messing
144160	149040	with me. But, you know, it is what it is, so. Rama says if you divide by cat, you get
149040	157120	a kitten, but technically if you multiply two cat equals kitten, six kitten. I can't
157120	163560	even understand any of this. Alright, so also say hello in studio. We have another guest
163560	169360	joining us tonight, RKDN42. How are you, my friend? Oh, I'm doing okay. Long time no see.
169360	172680	I haven't seen you since, I don't think you've been here since the marathon episode. Yep,
172680	176320	that's the last time I was in. Which, funny enough, Salacious Pop was here for too. It's
176320	182440	almost like a marathon show reunion. No marathons, please, no marathons. Who wants to stay up
182440	188920	until 4 AM tonight? Woo! Yay! I don't have a podcast to edit after the show, so I can
188920	196080	do it. Let's go, let's do it. It's like New Year's Rockin' Eve. Alright, anyhow, let's
196080	202560	see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com. Act Deaf in our chatroom starts us off with
202560	207360	this classy comment. Salacious Pop, the occasional fourth host of the show, I wonder if he sleeps
207360	212520	with one of the hosts. Actually, I always refer to the chatroom as the ever-present
212520	216520	fourth guest on the show, so I think Act Deaf, you're implying that the entire chatroom is
216520	221160	in fact sleeping with one of the hosts, I think is what he's really trying to say. Slumber
221160	226000	party! Whoever falls asleep first because their underwear thrown in the freezer. Follow
226000	230280	your dreams and never let anyone tell you that you cannot sleep your way to the paragon
230280	235680	of independent video game journalism. You just, you put on your little black dress,
235680	241000	and you work it, and you will be where I am now. Believe in your dreams. Yes. I have to
241000	245440	share something right now, before I forget about it, and before we get to our gaming
245440	250200	weeks. It's not something I need antibiotics for, is it? This gorgeous piece of journalism,
250200	253740	which I will take a picture of and show the chatroom in a moment, is the American River
253740	261720	Review 2011 edition. I've done design in this. It's $25. Go buy one! Why would anyone not
261720	266200	in this area want one? Because this thing wins, like, Uber awards. We have people in
266200	271200	Sweden that listen to this show. Why should a Swedish person buy some community college
271200	277240	– oh, recipes! Fantastic literature. It's the best of edition. Fantastic art. Fashion.
277240	284760	I bet all of our, like, gaming guys that listen to this show, you know, in their teens that
284760	290000	are, you know, between games of Call of Duty and Halo Reach are like, oh my god, fashion!
290000	296000	No, there's also – Where do I buy? Some of the art in here is definitely nerd-influenced.
296000	300500	Is there any video game reviews in there? No, but there's lots of talk of video games
300500	306280	in some of the stories. Okay. So obviously people, some of the writers are definite geeks,
306280	311520	but it is a worthy purchase. I will find the ordering information and post it somewhere
311520	316680	so everyone can see. But I've worked on this one. And also, if you send me the money
316680	320720	to get it for you, I will autograph it and get other people to autograph it and send
320720	325520	it back to you so you can have an autographed copy. I'll autograph it, I guess, even though
325520	328880	I had nothing to do with the publication of that book. I'm talking about the other people
328880	333840	that worked on the magazine. Alright, anyway. Let's get into some actual gaming content.
333840	338400	It does happen occasionally on this program. We talk about video games. And we always started
338400	342760	off with a little bit of how was your gaming week. So DarkSakura, besides, you know, doing
342760	347800	all that book stuff, how was your gaming week? My gaming week was full of some Star Trek
347800	357440	Online because the new Episode III came out. And it's awesome. By awesome, I mean amazing.
357440	366440	It's really hard to take a picture of something black. I, uh... What? Never mind. What? No,
366440	371360	that's inappropriate. Just don't take a picture of my penis then, okay? I was just gonna say
371360	374840	that was... I went there, I went there. That was rumored to be a problem with the Kinect
374840	382720	at one time. At any rate, I played a lot of Final Fantasy... Final... Fucking Final Fantasy.
382720	387520	I played a lot of Star Trek Online. They have completely redone Sector Space. I was showing
387520	392560	you guys the pictures. Now you can actually turn off that little grid thing. And when
392560	396640	the grid is on, it's actually a lot less pronounced. But then you can just fly around like you're
396640	401120	in space. And you have the little light trails as your ship moves. Which people were complaining
401120	406400	about. Wait, light trails and grid? The grids were gone. And it's not a light cycle. They're
406400	411540	trying to separate themselves from Tron a little bit? No. People were complaining that
411540	415760	when you were in warp, it didn't look like you were in warp. When you hit maximum level,
415760	422520	does the game tell you end of line? No. When you approach systems... It used to be that
422520	426240	it would look like a little glowing model of a system. You know, like you had in science
426240	434360	class. Now it's you approach stars. And as you get closer, it actually looks like a sun.
434360	440560	And the planets pop up around it. And it's like you're actually approaching the system.
440560	444680	And only other turkeys will get this. When you go like to the badlands, or to little
444680	450420	nebula or something. When you approach it, it actually looks like a haze off in the distance
450420	454880	and then you're in there. Then when you actually enter the system or the area, then you're
454880	458760	fully... Rob's pulling up the freaking... Well, I was going to say that we have a clip
458760	461840	of the soundtrack for the new Star Trek expansion.
461840	476920	As you're flying through space? No? You can't touch a rainbow? It looks like they've retextured
476920	483400	some of the planets. They've retextured the characters. They've updated some stuff. Earth's
483400	490600	Starbase has a basement now. Oooh, fucking basement. I also finally decided to make an
490600	497680	Orion slave girl. Running around in a bikini. It's fantastic. Apparently you can modify
497680	501720	the gourd now like anyone wants to play a giant freaking lizard. Okay, I have to share
501720	507600	this and it has something to do with it. There's my favorite Star Trek episode reviewer on
507600	514040	YouTube. It's SF Debris. He's funny. It's the highly opinionated Star Trek reviews.
514040	522600	And he was talking about Cisco... They did one for Trials and Tribulations for DS9. And
522600	526800	talking about Cisco wanting... He could have talked to Kirk about all this other stuff.
526800	531960	Instead he wanted to hear about the one time he porched a giant lizard in the nose. Punched?
531960	538680	I said not porched. I wonder what a porch punch is. This guy's reviews are fantastic.
538680	545440	It was Barry Waddle on purpose. Maybe because Dork von Weenie was already taken. Arne Darvin,
545440	550240	you see, is actually a Klingon. He was surgically ultra-depressed as a spy because when you're
550240	553800	a Klingon... This guy's really funny. Of course he also said that the Defiant should have
553800	560600	been named Ben Sisko's motherfucking pimp slap... pimp hand. Pimp slap hand. That was
560600	567440	it. Ben Sisko's motherfucking left pimp slap hand. Welcome to the Star Trek humor podcast.
567440	571760	Anyway. We have some really funny jokes for you today. So back to that... I have a really
571760	577520	good zinger about Klingons. And stay tuned because... Is this NPR? Where am I? Oh my
577520	589600	God. Talk of the nation. Oh my God. If I can finish with my story... But at any rate...
589600	596880	They've made lots of changes for the better. Still pissed off at Dabo. Hololita still annoying.
596880	602200	And that's really about it. They've done a bunch of other retexturing. But really they've
602200	606440	closed stuff off. The one thing I'm looking forward to is trying out the foundry. Which
606440	612360	is... You can create your own missions. And then have other people go in and play them.
612360	617880	You can put them up for other people to download and play. So... The good thing about that
617880	621800	is that while maybe you've gone through all the major missions and everything is... Oh
621800	627360	yay. But you can actually go through and play new content that other people have created.
627360	634680	And that's really neat. On the Tribble server they've got this thing to create new content.
634680	638880	Which I haven't gotten to work yet. But I'm gonna look into that too. The Tribble server
638880	643520	is the playtest server. So you can actually get a look at things that are coming out before
643520	647120	they come out on the official server. Which I think is cool. So it's like they have a
647120	653920	continuous beta going on. Like wow? Except this is a special one where actually the stuff
653920	661400	is broken on purpose. Like wow? And the stuff that's fixed is ready for everybody else to
661400	670520	play without being broken. Okay. The last issue that the free expansion that City of
670520	677080	Heroes put out was issue 14. The mission architect creator. Where you could create your own campaign
677080	682380	and that was the last expansion that Cryptic worked on. So it sounds like they're doing
682380	686960	something similar for Star Trek. Yeah. They're really putting a lot of their attention on
686960	693400	Star Trek Online. And what I would like is for maybe a Vice Admiral level 2 or something.
693400	696960	Because right now my main character is Max and she has tons of fun to play. Although
696960	703720	I have found out that Orions kick a lot of ass. If you play a female Orion you get a
703720	710920	power called Seduce. It's called, they just called it, look at my boobs. Just saying you
710920	715320	can get a succubus with a warlock character and she will show people her boobs and use
715320	718880	a move called Seduce. Just saying. Remember my offer still stands if people want to pay
718880	722600	for me to play World of Warcraft I will. Why can't I have an offer like that? I thought
722600	728520	that was going to go in a different direction there. I want people. Alright. Apparently
728520	732200	the chat room likes my NPR voice. So one of these days I'm going to have to just do an
732200	736600	Orange Lounge Radio and all NPR voice. Or you could just go listen to that Techno Kitten
736600	739480	Adventure interview last week. Hello this is Terry Gross. Today we're going to talk
739480	744560	about. Hello you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We have a hilarious interview coming
744560	748760	up with Nick, the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure. He'll be joining us to talk about
748760	754760	his game. And also we'll be talking about USL Madness. It's maddening. Be sure to get
754760	757200	your miss in right away. And also when Rob uses that voice it sounds a lot like the Saturday
757200	762320	Night Live sketch. And then I expect to have Martha Stewart come out and make brownies.
762320	769280	Anyhow. Loki how was your gaming week? Please help. My gaming week consisted of not much
769280	775440	because one I didn't have internet. Which is not really a big factor because I don't
775440	785440	play online games at home. At least not anymore. And what else? Basically Grand Theft Auto
785440	794760	work. Swords and Poker 2 on the iPod. And I did try out Infinity Blade which is all
794760	801520	sorts of beautiful and actually plays pretty good. So it's very neat what they can do on
801520	808880	the iPod. But yeah that's pretty much it. Didn't play a whole lot. Let's go to our guests.
808880	813760	We'll see if our guests have anything exciting to share. How about Salacious Pulp? Only two
813760	818040	games to talk about really. Maybe two and a half. The half is Knights of the Crystals
818040	824440	on Facebook. Knights of the Clicky. Knights of the Clicky. Not really a game. I gotta
824440	830000	use all your action points. You don't have to feed cows in it so already it's good. I
830000	835840	forgot to spend my action points before coming to this show. I'm pissed. Dammit. Oh well.
835840	842280	If you buy the $50 worth of Square Enix points that's the best value. What a waste spending
842280	850480	money on that game. Like the items you get. Forget it. Then Poker Night at the Inventory
850480	858000	on Steam. I've been slowly unlocking because I've definitely gotten better at the Texas
858000	864940	Hold'em thing as I've been playing. I've been unlocking the various tables and deck cards.
864940	869880	So it does have unlockables in it. No new characters. But I have the Fruit Fucker Card
869880	876620	Table and the Salmon Max. Don't you mean the Fruit Friend? Fruit Friend. Fruit Friend Card
876620	880760	Table and the Salmon Max deck of cards. Is that what they're calling it in there? Fruit
880760	886800	Friend yeah. I just really liked when we were at PAX a few years ago someone cosplayed the
886800	890640	Fruit Fucker. There were like three people cosplayed as the Fruit Fucker. That was great.
890640	895600	They just all looked the same. And then Cataclysm. You know we should play Poker Night at the
895600	902480	Inventory online sometime. Oh wait. It's just fan service. The ride is really funny. Strong
902480	907960	Bad cracks me up the most. I have to poke a little fun at it. Come on. For the longest
907960	913160	time we look like we're totally tell tale biased. So I have to take an opportunity to
913160	918280	poke this one where I can. When the Seg was on a couple weeks ago on the show he was like
918280	923600	it's a very basic fan service game. Don't expect it to be anything other than you know
923600	929600	kind of trying to take us down a couple notches on the hype. That's true. Yeah. And then Cataclysm
929600	934580	of course came out Monday night so I'm in Deepholm right now level. No I'm about to
934580	939240	start Oldham. I'm level 83. Haven't done any of the new level 1 content yet for any of
939240	945440	the races. I'm very much working on my main. And you have a separate WoW podcast for all
945440	949300	of that so that's all I'm gonna say. But it's out. It's there. That's okay. I'm gonna talk
949300	954840	Cataclysm a little bit here. Just cause it's a huge huge thing. So it has to cross over
954840	962360	a little bit. Overall I'm very amazed at how seamless the digital like the midnight rollover
962360	966840	where everyone was logged off at midnight and then we all I mean it took us 20-30 minutes
966840	971560	to log back in for to access all the new areas. I don't even think it was that bad. Yeah and
971560	976200	then there's been no server crashes. Nothing. I thought that they did a great job in turning
976200	982080	that over compared to I guess Wrath and Burning Crusade. Yeah it could have been a lot worse.
982080	987140	They did a pretty good job. Awesome. Yes. Alright. Okay. What? Yes ma'am. When I get
987140	992780	back from Washington I'll play for a month. That's the spirit. Hey there's actually email
992780	997240	coming up about how you can do that for free so we're gonna get to that later. I know you
997240	1000860	probably haven't peeked at the mailbag yet but somebody who listens to the other show
1000860	1004840	also listens to this one and sent a great tip so we'll talk about that when we get to
1004840	1008680	the mailbag. First though we gotta finish off gaming weeks. Arcadian 42. I know you
1008680	1014760	play a lot of, you have a pretty diverse lineup of games that you play right? Yeah. This week
1014760	1020860	hasn't been that too many games this week. One of them is Rockman 3 of course and also
1020860	1026820	played some more Super Meat Boy. That's fun. Isn't Super Meat Boy great? You haven't been
1026820	1031180	on the show since it came out but. Yeah so I've played it for a little while. The box
1031180	1037820	art, the name, terrible but the game itself, awesome. Yeah and it's really a thumb killer
1037820	1045400	too. I got one of the new Xbox controllers. I come out briefly that the D-pad's a little
1045400	1048740	bit better. I'm not sure if it's that much improved. It might hurt your finger a little
1048740	1053100	bit more than the original. Interesting. No I forgot those had come out. I knew they were
1053100	1056760	on there. I forgot that now's the season. Interesting. But it's nice having a better
1056760	1061700	charge back so that it lasts longer than the older one. Have you used that at all for Game
1061700	1065780	Room? I know you were big into Game Room for a little while. I've barely gotten done into
1065780	1071340	Game Room. Have you heard about what's come out in Game Room? Like this week, I'm not
1071340	1076180	even kidding, Twinbee and Daytona Twinbee both hit Game Room this week. And like Puyen
1076180	1082140	and like just all of a sudden out of nowhere Game Pack 12 was like bam bam bam like all
1082140	1088580	these huge titles came out. They're all Konami but it's almost like, hey why didn't you give
1088580	1092500	us this shit like three months ago? We might have paid more attention. I think I downloaded
1092500	1096180	those packs but I haven't actually because they were like taking a long time to download
1096180	1101060	so I went to some other game. And the main game I've been playing this week is Resonance
1101060	1107380	of Fate which is a triage game that Sega put out. It's a RPG. It's actually a pretty, it's
1107380	1112860	got an interesting battle system. All the characters use guns and so they have different
1112860	1117260	like they have like a machine gun and the other people have like guns and like thrown
1117260	1122060	weapons like grenades. So you level up by your weapon experience and basically you have
1122060	1127420	to think strategically because you have to move around the board because when you move
1127420	1132380	the enemies move and they charge up and everything. You have like the set number of like hero
1132380	1138700	gauge or like where you can have your character run across the fields like the other side
1138700	1144140	like most of the way to the other side of the field where you're pretty much shooting
1144140	1147820	at the enemy as many times as you can. But you have to like, sometimes you have to save
1147820	1151700	up charges because if you do that you get different status effects like your machine
1151700	1157820	gun you'll do more damage that you can make convert to real damage. Sort of a weird, sort
1157820	1162980	of a different like damage system. How old is this game? It came out a little while ago
1162980	1167220	right? March. Oh. Yeah it's about that long. I thought this was like an old old game. No
1167220	1172900	no it came out this year. I missed this one. Yeah. It's a 360 game? Yes it is. I've been
1172900	1176220	looking for a new RPG to play on 360. Yeah and there's probably several things you'd
1176220	1181460	like about it because the characters are interesting. They went into a lot of oddball kind of characters
1181460	1187220	that basically are going on different fetch quests and do this for me. Go to this area
1187220	1198340	and fetch me something. And yeah some of them are a bit crazy. But basically it's like a
1198340	1203740	series of vignettes and that kind of thing. At least for now because the overarching story
1203740	1209700	you don't really get to that until later and I haven't gone that far yet. But let me see
1209700	1213620	what. Actually the system map is a little bit interesting because it's actually a hex
1213620	1219140	map where you have to lay down these like little things of hexes that you have to put
1219140	1226220	down to get through the other areas and there's colors and everything like that. It's actually
1226220	1232180	a pretty interesting game. And also you can also play dress up with the characters because
1232180	1235380	you can actually buy all these different sort of clothes. It's just not a JRPG if there's
1235380	1242300	not dress up at some point. Going to chat with chat.orangemanstrator.com I'll let Arcadian42
1242300	1247220	finish but I wanted to get some of the comments here. Oh you're good? Let's see. Some folks
1247220	1252260	talking about the new controller that they're liking that. Azure Edge in our chat room says
1252260	1258620	I love the box for the new Xbox 360 controller. Also a question about game room. Rama says
1258620	1263340	didn't sunset riders drop too? No that's rumored that that is in the game pack. I'll tell you
1263340	1267460	what came out. I pulled up the list while Arcadian was talking there. Daytona Twinbee,
1267460	1275660	Puyen, Thwacker, Amadar, Off the Wall, Twinbee, Blades of Steel, Pitfall 2, Trick Trap, and
1275660	1279260	Vektron have all come out in the past three weeks. Yeah. Many hadn't checked them out
1279260	1283980	because they stopped updating their Facebook thing because of all the crowd stuff. Closures
1283980	1288020	and stuff so it kind of makes you forget to look. There's one thing about the new controller
1288020	1293460	that I didn't mention was that the analog sticks have this little lip in them so it
1293460	1298380	makes it might kind of hurt your finger a little bit more than the old one. So especially
1298380	1302420	with Super Meat Boy where you're jamming the controller left and right and up and down
1302420	1306820	all the time that can kind of bite into your finger a bit. Arcadian you know you're kind
1306820	1311020	of known as being like a quiet guy and you know you're playing games but usually you're
1311020	1316260	just you know you kind of you're quiet and you don't yell you're not obnoxious like I
1316260	1320980	am in crowds. But I have to ask like when you play Super Meat Boy are you the type that
1320980	1326540	just like fuck! I can't fucking believe I lost that level! God damn it! And you throw
1326540	1331300	the controller against the ground. Meow! Not really for this one just because it's so fast.
1331300	1334980	This one because like with Dead Rising 2 I was playing that and there was one point in
1334980	1340860	the game where I basically only place I could save was like a few a little bit before the
1340860	1345980	chef guy and where he's and I wasn't able to get from where I was saved I could barely
1345980	1350820	just get any enough weapons to actually fight him so like every time it's like just getting
1350820	1355620	killed by this guy over and over again so I got really pissed. That guy was making me
1355620	1360940	swear like like fucking crazy. There you go! Ahh there you go! Did you hear that? Yes.
1360940	1365080	Just thinking about it makes me fucking crazy! Yeah and the same thing with Kyle in the first
1365080	1370820	game that guy was an ass. Like fucking annoying as hell. It's always the quiet ones. But Super
1370820	1375780	Meat Boy just like oh damn damn oh well shit. And then go on and just do it again because
1375780	1379300	it's so fast you don't you don't really have to think about it just do it again. You have
1379300	1384860	to ask Leisha's Pop about when I play Super Meat Boy. It's pretty exciting. In fact he'll
1384860	1388320	even egg me on. He'll be like don't you want to play Super Meat Boy? Oh Rob you're so close
1388320	1392100	to beating that one level. Come on you should play Super Meat Boy. Come on just you'll have
1392100	1396900	that level beat in five minutes come on. It's like entertainment for him. Yeah that's mainly
1396900	1400620	the reason I haven't gone back to Dead Rising 2 because I'm sort of since I'm there I want
1400620	1404380	to beat it I don't want to go on and just because with Dead Rising 2 I can just pass
1404380	1409340	him up and let that that invent expire but I'd like to actually do it for this time going
1409340	1413060	through but maybe when I go back to it I'll just kind of I'll see if I can do it and then
1413060	1421900	just say fuck it and go on. Alrighty. Let's see going back to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com
1421900	1425780	SolarFlare says I've been playing Resonance of Fate for PS3 makes me feel like I don't
1425780	1430320	know how to play JRPGs anymore. Dungeon Buster says Fates battle mechanics take a little
1430320	1433940	getting used to. I stopped playing it for a week or so and had to hit up easy encounters
1433940	1438620	all over again just to get back into the groove. So you know what else you know what other
1438620	1441980	controller I guess had come out recently I really want to get is that Tron controller
1441980	1447120	because the game came out and sadly I have missed the game although I hear it's not so
1447120	1452340	great like I guess the reviews are mixed at best so but I'm still curious you know I liked
1452340	1458280	what I played at E3 so reviewers don't always get it right either so. You're reading one
1458280	1462460	man's opinion that's all it really is. It's not a team of people reading it. What if it's
1462460	1466340	Metacritic where you're reading several people's opinions. Oh big deal it's a few people I
1466340	1470580	mean they're all over the board with stuff. There were some people that thought Gran Turismo
1470580	1475260	5 was awesome some that hated it there was I'm trying to think of one that had really
1475260	1484820	weird reviews on it. What was it? Might have been Epic Mickey because there were some people
1484820	1489860	that really loved Epic Mickey and people that hated it. I don't know it's gonna be like
1489860	1494740	that for everything. Now see this is the weird thing is that Tron Evolution supposedly has
1494740	1499180	a 58 on Metacritic right now and this is based on 6 critics but then I don't see critic reviews
1499180	1505420	so that makes me think okay they haven't really had that so I don't know whatever I guess
1505420	1510900	the movie only has like a 50 something too so yeah but people are dumb I mean they're
1510900	1515460	like the story. Movie critics you have to take with a grain of salt like I my expectations
1515460	1520980	for the Tron movie are very low like there's as long as it's pretty and at some point I
1520980	1526340	hear end of line I'm gonna be fine you know what I mean it's my expectations are set really
1526340	1534060	low all right have fucking wait six days six more days I know I heard a Tron rumor oh something
1534060	1540440	to do with OMG spoilers no okay something to do I think this is what how the story was
1540440	1547660	read but Disney is pulling the original Tron DVD from retailers because it's already done
1547660	1551640	it's been in the vault forever they're not gonna release it until later because I thought
1551640	1555600	that the way that it looks on the box art where it says Tron they don't want people
1555600	1560900	to go oh this is that movie that's in theaters right now so I'll just buy this when it's
1560900	1566640	a completely different movie I think what what the big deal is is that there is a remastered
1566640	1571560	one waiting to be released and they're not going to release it until after the movie
1571560	1576560	comes out really know a box that's coming you know a box that's gonna happen because
1576560	1581340	the they actually got the original animator back to go in and do all the touch-up work
1581340	1586020	and so that reminds me I need to watch the original Tron this week again because it's
1586020	1592220	been so long I barely remember I have it and the laserdiscs I was watching they had a really
1592220	1600240	it was on I think it might have been Gizmo it might have been Gawker I had it or one
1600240	1606240	of their I know they have like a comic one too that io9 or something like that anyways
1606240	1611480	they were covering like what like Tron and the stuff that they remember from it and it
1611480	1618560	clips and it's really like cheesy and slapsticky and like a lot of it well you know it was
1618560	1624200	it was the 80s but it really is very dated but it's still fantastic you know an awesome
1624200	1629440	place to try and find it on UMD they made it for the PSP on UMD I bet that would be
1629440	1634200	one of the easiest ones to find so probably still people trying to unload those discs
1634200	1637640	well actually don't let go of that mic there as I spoke oh wait no I already asked you
1637640	1641560	but you can we never mind let go of it I guess I'll talk about my gaming week everybody else
1641560	1647360	is gone mine I don't have a whole lot of exciting stuff to add because you know obviously it
1647360	1651120	was a big week with Cataclysm and just a big week personally I honestly have not had time
1651120	1654760	for a lot of games in general as I think a lot of people are right now with the holidays
1654760	1658320	and everything going on but I did of course play World of Warcraft Cataclysm which even
1658320	1663000	though I have a separate show for wow I have to mention some of the big stuff you know
1663000	1669540	obviously they've redone all the old content and I'm hearing the Worgen and Goblin experience
1669540	1673760	is amazing but you know I talked about on the other show for a little bit my experience
1673760	1677480	just going back and leveling a Gnome Priest which is one of the new race class combos
1677480	1682720	that you don't need Cataclysm for and it was neat a neat upgrade a lot of the mechanics
1682720	1686600	from Wrath of the Lich King you now find in the classic wow and I think that's what's
1686600	1691320	pretty cool because it allows it to have more vehicle type quests and kind of zany things
1691320	1696880	like today I was in Oldham and I got a daily quest to do a whack-a-mole type of quest it's
1696880	1701800	just kind of weird stuff and a lot of very meta things like the whole plants versus zombies
1701800	1705280	quest that they have now or peace balloon versus ghouls whatever there's a lot of silly
1705280	1711000	things in it but the core game is still great and the end game I haven't seen a lot of the
1711000	1716080	85 end game yet because I'm only about 83 and a third now but I've played some of the
1716080	1720280	new dungeons and you know it's it's still that same kind of look and feel of course
1720280	1726600	of the previous wow expansions but they have definitely taken strides to make it not so
1726600	1730900	face roll is the term a lot of people use where you know those Wrath of the Lich King
1730900	1734320	heroic dungeons were very face roll for the past three months I'm meaning you could just
1734320	1737280	sit there at the keyboard and just three three three three three or whatever your button
1737280	1741240	is pretty much roll your way through any dungeon you really have to take a step back and well
1741240	1746520	oh crap this is all new content I'm not over geared I have to think about this and you
1746520	1751400	know as a healer which I play in the game they made heals very expensive so now you
1751400	1755040	really have to think about do I really need to top this person off or should I go back
1755040	1758480	to focusing on the tank so lots of interesting little game mechanics like that but if you
1758480	1762280	want to know more about that I got the other show so we'll talk more about that as far
1762280	1765520	as other games that I played there were some free games that came out on Xbox this week
1765520	1769080	and one of them I don't even remember the name of it somebody in chat will jump in it
1769080	1773720	was one person plays a driver you drive around the course and the other person can shoot
1773720	1778060	the driver Doritos games yeah it's one of those Doritos games that sounds like an old
1778060	1784480	arcade game was it not the shoot it was like one person was the driver and the other person
1784480	1789920	had the gun and it was a two person arcade game you are thinking about like the I know
1789920	1795960	what you're talking about the tango and cash tango and cash yeah oh no uh lucky wild lucky
1795960	1802860	wild that was my mistake that's it no I I know what you're talking about though that's
1802860	1809120	neat looking it's stupid it's free but yeah it's free exactly it's it was better than
1809120	1815800	Yaris it was better than totem ball um you download the other one avatar crash I downloaded
1815800	1819820	it but I haven't played it yet because then I played more rock band 3 and I actually did
1819820	1823720	that whole thing in rock band 3 I was like you know I don't have any vocal achievements
1823720	1828080	what you need to do is you need to get in on the ground floor of these Doritos challenges
1828080	1834520	things and really that's where you propose the whole you know golden girls RPG Grand
1834520	1839640	Theft Auto type game I know I hope maybe for the next year's Doritos competition we will
1839640	1844040	have the golden girls with guns game that's just Grand Theft Auto with the golden girls
1844040	1849020	that's all I really want to say I'll have you know Doritos are kind of orangish it works
1849020	1853080	and the golden girls lived in Miami so they were kind of orangish you know what it just
1853080	1857760	occurred to me okay imagine like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game or the x-men game
1857760	1863120	or the Simpsons only with the golden girls I know right like Sophia hits them with that
1863120	1871560	giant purse uh-huh and like Blanche has the slut attack uh-huh and and Arthur Dorothy
1871560	1879060	Dorothy is sassy she has the bitch attack mm-hmm and basically I guess Rose would just
1879060	1883360	walk through the game clueless no she has stories about St. Olaf she has the St. Olaf
1883360	1891680	she has a goat that would come out yes hopefully maybe that'll come to indie marketplace because
1891680	1896120	that's that's where all the good ideas seem to go all right anyhow that was pretty much
1896120	1900360	my gaming week I don't even remember the name of that game and it's you know it's free it's
1900360	1903920	better than some of the other free offerings but at the same time I think it's Doritos
1903920	1909120	crash course or something like that no it I don't even think that's it either it's like
1909120	1913840	this tells you how memorable the experience was what an amazing game podcast we have here
1913840	1918240	where it's like I played some game I think the best thing to actually come out of that
1918240	1924240	was me bringing up another obscure game yes lucky a while was pretty awesome actually
1924240	1931020	and then the Golden Girls game chat was awesome too I'll remember in a minute thank you Doritos
1931020	1935000	I'm trying to you know what I'm doing right now I'm actually clicking to my profile harm's
1935000	1941000	way that was the name of the game thank God thank God for the xbox.com tracking everything
1941000	1948000	that you play harm's way was the name of the game phew I would that's weird that chat didn't
1948000	1952160	beat me to that usually having the live chat room some people jump in with the game nobody
1952160	1957000	knew that game guess that should tell me right there because the chat room didn't care clearly
1957000	1962040	all right let's housekeeping real quick if you want to follow us on Facebook facebook.com
1962040	1965600	slash orange launch radio we can always use more fans there and of course Twitter ask
1965600	1968720	us some questions on Twitter we'll get to those in the second half of our show tonight
1968720	1978920	twitter.com slash o l r meanwhile let's get into the news tonight yes of course the ever
1978920	1985920	denied but absolutely coming psp2 more rumors about the capabilities of it since we don't
1985920	1990080	know too much about it yet there are people that are working with it they're saying that
1990080	1997000	the graphics are comparable to early playstation 3 titles says that the low resolution screen
1997000	2004400	will surely help minimize the quality gap between playstation 3 games and psp2 games
2004400	2012240	but they're saying that it should be rather easy to port ps3 games over to the psp2 which
2012240	2016760	sounds pretty impressive actually that sounds dang impressive but there's got to be a difference
2016760	2020320	in quality like I don't think that thing's gonna be sport and blu-ray or whatever here's
2020320	2024600	the thing though is you know the textures don't have to be as big I mean they can save
2024600	2030280	a lot because it's it's a smaller screen the resolution isn't going to be as you know big
2030280	2036000	as the playstation 3 and because of that they can do a lot of tricks kind of like for example
2036000	2040320	how they can do a lot of tricks with like you know infinity blade to make it look nice
2040320	2045600	on an ipad or an ipod because you know they do a bunch of texture tricks and stuff to
2045600	2050360	make it look like it's actually a higher resolution than it is and actually kind of the same goes
2050360	2056140	with even just the psp now um you know they have a lot of tricks to make things look better
2056140	2059400	so I'm not too concerned about that I think it's gonna be awesome and as long as I have
2059400	2064180	two you know dual analog six which is great yeah are we talking about having more synergy
2064180	2070440	between the psp and the playstation 3 with this because when there's a lot of neat tricks
2070440	2073520	that I don't think people even know about that the psp will do like with this whole
2073520	2078480	remote play yeah getting it to control your ps3 through the psp I bet you most people
2078480	2084200	don't even know about that I think but there's they could do it right now with the psp2 assuming
2084200	2088440	that they have two shoulder buttons which they really should on that I think that that
2088440	2093360	would be great because not only would you be able to do that with um you know like I'm
2093360	2098560	assuming that this will also be able to emulate playstation 1 games as well and possibly playstation
2098560	2104020	2 games later on down the line have downloadable for it um I mean that would be really cool
2104020	2110400	and then with the remote play yeah you would be able to probably you know play these games
2110400	2113640	to their full extent because you'll have the controls that are going to be mimicking the
2113640	2118920	same thing whatever happened to I remember at e3 when this thing was first announced
2118920	2125320	remember Ridge Racer and remember when they were using the psp as like a rear view mirror
2125320	2130720	did that functionality ever happen in a game like where the psp was kind of your controller
2130720	2134980	or your spin-off device or whatever from the playstation 3 like I don't remember that ever
2134980	2143320	actually happening did that technology just not play out um maybe somebody has had games
2143320	2149640	for that but not necessarily rear view mirror are we talking anything like actually really
2149640	2155240	cool are we talking like buzz will allow you to use the psp to buzz in you know what I
2155240	2160320	mean like I don't I'm talking about something actually kind of like different I don't remember
2160320	2166000	like nothing really stands out how you could visit the Animal Crossing village on your
2166000	2171680	Game Boy Advance when you played GameCube Animal Crossing remember that now that I remember
2171680	2179440	that awesome cheap mm-hmm all right so comment from a chairman chat on orange on twitter.com
2179440	2184080	game guru in our chat says I'd rather hear about the price points of the 3ds and the
2184080	2194480	psp2 any crazy idea what this might cost the psp2 I'd be willing to bet $300 or 250 do
2194480	2198880	you think 250 sounds I don't know it's hard to say depends what they're trying to push
2198880	2203880	on it I mean I could see it maybe as high as $300 because they're looking if they're
2203880	2209420	going to try to compare this say with like an iPod or like you know something of that
2209420	2216880	nature then you know iPods are like 200 $300 so they might be able to do that and it also
2216880	2222320	really depends on what the 3ds comes out at too I mean 3ds I would hope it'd be around
2222320	2232040	like $200 at the very most but it's hard to say Bobby Blackwolf in our charm says nothing
2232040	2236200	like pac-man versus on the GameCube no yeah because there was that whole pac-man game
2236200	2240960	on the GameCube where you could use what the advances I think were as the controllers the
2240960	2247320	ghosts or something no no pac-man would use that because he could see the whole screen
2247320	2251240	I don't remember but it was something it was something like that no the ghost would be
2251240	2257440	on the TV because they would you know be split screen on the TV I think and then pac-man
2257440	2261640	would be on the Game Boy Advance because pac-man could see the whole screen because the ghost
2261640	2269200	couldn't see where you were at all right because if it's on the TV the people with screen hack
2269200	2272120	and then black hole continues to say it was just a remote play where you could play the
2272120	2279320	same game on your PSP on your ps3 sometimes not every game even does that back and forth
2279320	2283600	either it's mostly the ps1 class and here's the funny thing about that too and you know
2283600	2287160	thanks to the hackers and stuff they found out that a lot of games that don't support
2287160	2292320	remote play actually could support remote play but they just don't they they've hacked
2292320	2298200	different games to support remote isn't usually a button issue or something no that's kind
2298200	2305560	of sad all right well also speaking of sad let's talk about Final Fantasy 14 because
2305560	2311240	there's actually this is uh this is kind of sad actually but but I think a lot of us said
2311240	2316120	this needs to happen here's the deal Final Fantasy 14 obviously the PC version came out
2316120	2320320	and it's been getting slammed back and forth and we were talking about people selling off
2320320	2325200	their stock and all this other stuff here's the thing the PlayStation 3 version of Final
2325200	2329960	Fantasy 14 it was announced this week that it is not coming out in March it will be coming
2329960	2334680	out indefinitely like they don't know when they have now said this game has been delayed
2334680	2340920	indefinitely and that is like one step short of saying just the whole damn thing is canceled
2340920	2347720	which is very very strange but here's um here's what they're saying about the CEO of Squeenix
2347720	2354080	Yoshiwata basically apologized for Final Fantasy 14 and said that the Final Fantasy 14 team
2354080	2361440	is restructuring there will be new leadership Hiromichi Tanaka the producer out Naoki Yoshida
2361440	2367480	in the new producer director and a lot of the other positions are being restaffed they
2367480	2373640	are quote working on a concrete plan outlining Final Fantasy 14's new direction it almost
2373640	2379640	sounds like they are just starting the damn thing over which is crazy like have we ever
2379640	2384320	had a game maybe there's got to be another MMO that's done something like this but just
2384320	2388700	basically nuke itself and start over is what it sounds like they're doing they have also
2388700	2395280	extended the PC free trial period until the new plan is implemented so that could be months
2395280	2399920	away if you own the PC version of Final Fantasy 14 for being an early adopter you might be
2399920	2406160	on that for six months or here's here's the great thing you guys after Christmas or even
2406160	2410760	maybe before those copies of Final Fantasy 14 are going to plummet in price and pretty
2410760	2414520	soon for about 20 bucks you'll be able to pick up the game and play for free online
2414520	2419560	indefinitely granted you won't be playing a great game but it will be cheap so there
2419560	2427760	you go so that's really interesting to me I think I had said on the show before that
2427760	2432120	I think I even used the phrase heads will roll at Squeenix and this is around the time
2432120	2436200	it was the episode wherever the news came up about the stock getting sold I said that
2436200	2441520	this is inevitable conclusion that this is really an embarrassment but I don't know if
2441520	2448760	I necessarily blame the producer who got canned over this as much as I blame whoever made
2448760	2454760	them put this out at Christmas this game was a year away from release and all of that year
2454760	2459520	the engine is pretty much done that the game runs in the graphics look great the sounds
2459520	2465160	fine the problem was all the like game mechanics weren't implemented there's no fucking auction
2465160	2472020	house in the game right now hello that's the problem who whatever executive or whatever
2472020	2477360	decision made them put this game out this year that's who needs to be canned in my opinion
2477360	2482320	because this game was a year away from being released in reality and so now it's back to
2482320	2487440	the drawing board yeah and I it just seemed like with them releasing it in September October
2487440	2492000	of this year you know a lot of people were saying well it's kind of a shit circus on
2492000	2495920	PC but they'll work out the bugs and maybe it'll play a lot better with a controller
2495920	2501760	in your hand and it'll be you know decent on the ps3 there'll be some you know bug fixes
2501760	2507760	maybe a little major patch that comes out and now it just sounds like okay this game
2507760	2514360	is so bad that the console they're like we're not even we're not we're not gonna try it
2514360	2519680	like this is awful it just is really stunning you have to wonder if at some point Sony is
2519680	2523480	actually come in and said we don't want this game on our console this game is a turd do
2523480	2528920	not put on our system like I bet that's exactly what happened and I think that it was this
2528920	2533320	whole oh no we stand by our product we stand by our product thing and keep hoping and hoping
2533320	2540700	it doesn't look um this is your reality check bang bang so uh dark Tetsuya in our chat room
2540700	2544660	says rob and don't forget the anti-addiction timer where they're where they cut off your
2544660	2550920	XP after so long I actually think a lot of that shit's been overblown because guess what
2550920	2556640	Warcraft has something similar but no one's talking about it World of Warcraft has something
2556640	2563680	very similar well forums are filled of and it better sour tears of the crime that the
2563680	2569200	anger it's the guild experience you can only gain a set amount of guild experience in a
2569200	2574080	week and I'll tell you what after this expansion was released I hit my week cap in a day and
2574080	2580960	a half and your guild together can only earn so much experience in a day and you get rewarded
2580960	2585960	when you don't play for a while you get double experience so I think a lot of this stuff
2585960	2591640	in 11 or I mean 14 excuse me was kind of overblown because it was what you could play like your
2591640	2596200	character for like 20 hours in a week before you started hitting penalties my understanding
2596200	2600640	with 14 is that it was the job system I don't know exactly what the names of the jobs were
2600640	2605840	but you couldn't min-max I don't know like leather working or whatever you had to trade
2605840	2610460	your job out for something else and then level that up yeah so they just wanted it wasn't
2610460	2617680	necessarily a OCD please take a shower and go to bed type thing but just you know it
2617680	2622460	wasn't it wasn't one of those it was just more you know we don't want you to min-max
2622460	2629200	one thing we want your character to be diverse zeba diversify zeba in our chair I think sums
2629200	2636240	it up very very bluntly with this one comment no chocobos either no mounts got to walk everywhere
2636240	2643640	it's not so much that but it's a Final Fantasy game with no chocobos that's like that's like
2643640	2649580	a Michael Bay movie with no explosion that's I that's an Anne Hathaway movie with no nude
2649580	2657560	scene what what is this I don't understand Tiger Claw on our charm says so Square Enix
2657560	2662980	just pulled an NBA elite and starting over kinda except they did it about three months
2662980	2666000	too late did they pull the game off shelves although they haven't really pulled the game
2666000	2673200	off shelves either it's just the copies on shelves currently are gathering a lot of dust
2673200	2679360	we'll see what happens also kind of along the same lines not only is there news about
2679360	2684240	Final Fantasy 14 but if you're kind of fed up with the current state of 14 maybe you
2684240	2689520	should go back to Final Fantasy 11 because there's a new expansion coming out in December
2689520	2693520	I don't think it's actually a official expansion it's just one of those like uber patches that's
2693520	2699220	gonna really change the game the level cap will be going up from 85 to 90 and there will
2699220	2703040	be a lot of new spells and abilities some new powers for blue mages because they get
2703040	2707040	monster abilities and so forth yeah and expansions I know are still coming out for this game
2707040	2711260	they're not retail expansions they're download expansions but this game still still trot
2711260	2715520	and ride along and with some of the screenshots you see that they pick you would think that
2715520	2721600	this game is a newer game they really are able to still sell this with some pretty screenshots
2721600	2725800	and I believe Steam whenever they have one of their sales which is all the time they
2725800	2732720	have a Final Fantasy 11 plus the 13 various expansions it's dirt cheap for like five bucks
2732720	2737200	nine bucks and I think it has a month that comes with it so yeah I get if 14 is that
2737200	2744260	bad check out the helipack on Steam for 11 yeah 11 is still cooking and it's doing pretty
2744260	2750320	well you know what 11 needs most of all though to lose PS2 support so they could like update
2750320	2754760	the engine you know what I mean yeah but at the same time a lot of people would like lower
2754760	2759440	end laptops and things that sort of able to run 11 you know because it is a PS2 game and
2759440	2763520	I'm sure there's PS2 Final Fantasy 11 players that are like shut your mouth Rob and you
2763520	2768080	know yeah I'm to bring up you know City of Heroes for the umteenth time they just had
2768080	2774280	a graphics update for going rogue but there's because it's an MMO that came out in 2004
2774280	2778640	there are people that are on computers from 2004 that are still running fine you can't
2778640	2782400	update the graphics too much because you're going to lose your subscriber base that's
2782400	2787600	been with you for six years so it's even if it was on the PC platform you still have that
2787600	2792720	limitation of you can't you can't force your subscriber base to go out and buy a new computer
2792720	2797960	just because the game is over X 90 years old so I'm interested in Final Fantasy 14 again
2797960	2801840	I will say though because you know what despite my criticisms of the game in the past I think
2801840	2805800	it is kind of big of square because I don't think a lot of companies would do this I think
2805800	2812520	some would say but this is it was an intended game feature right I think it's kind of big
2812520	2818680	a square to step up and say we've released the suck patch yeah okay we're going to redo
2818680	2823600	it and so now I'm like okay now maybe I can get excited about this game because now they're
2823600	2829620	going to put the year of time that it needed the first time into it I miss the flawless
2829620	2836080	godlike square where even their crap games smelled of vanilla and sang hosannas and now
2836080	2840920	they've made an actual shit bag of a game I know look at all the people that still love
2840920	2845800	Final Fantasy 8 to this day and like what a shit yeah during the ps1 era everything
2845800	2849960	and then saga frontier I'm just ruffling feathers because I know there's listeners out there
2849960	2854120	that are like you shut your mouth squall and zellen are awesome and lagoon oh my god yeah
2854120	2860800	the ps1 era you know saga frontier bad I'm hander good just square could do no wrong
2860800	2866080	Final Fantasy 7 and now it's like that this is what you've become look at yourself look
2866080	2872560	at your life look at your choices yeah solar flare in our chat room says now 14 is so bad
2872560	2878240	they are taking the guys from 11 that made 11 good and put them on 14 great because some
2878240	2883600	of the changes that 11 got like five years too late are actually made that game great
2883600	2887120	like the whole level sinking that's something that should have been put into the game about
2887120	2891200	a year after its release not five because you played 11 for about three years and it
2891200	2894960	still had a lot of problems and it finally I finally got sick of it like after honestly
2894960	2902240	after playing wow I couldn't take 11 anymore you know and I played 11 for like a week no
2902240	2906840	I played longer than that you did you were like and a couple months I was the queen of
2906840	2912040	doing all that crap on my controller too like I had all my macros set up on my trigger buttons
2912040	2917200	and I could do and it was just that one experience that finally was the straw and I'm like all
2917200	2922680	of you people suck and I'd left off in a big stomping diva huff so if it what solar flare
2922680	2928320	is saying like to hear that the guys that made 11 good are now gonna go make 14 good
2928320	2932840	wake me up when a release date is official for the ps3 version because this is now exciting
2932840	2938600	news again because the changes they made to 11 were great so this game stands the chance
2938600	2944160	to redeem itself on the PlayStation 3 but boy are they gonna have to fix the PC version
2944160	2949000	but you know what they'll do here's here's the easiest way all you do fix everything
2949000	2954440	with an expansion pack and just have the ps3 version include the expansion pack it's what
2954440	2958660	they did with 11 remember when 11 came out in the States it already had rise of the zillard
2958660	2962800	in it you could already play a dragoon you could already go to some new areas wouldn't
2962800	2969460	be anything new let's move on to some more stories dark Sakura well this is one of those
2969460	2975880	warm fuzzies and I really mean warm and fuzzy the charity child's play we know if Charles
2975880	2981600	play don't we of course they have capped the 11 million mark not 11 million mark when I
2981600	2986360	say 1 million mark it'd be nice if they kept the 11 million mark wouldn't it we just got
2986360	2992840	done talking about Final Fantasy 11 so you know but no they've capped they've reached
2992840	2997240	1.2 million American dollars in all their donations along with the desert bus for hope
2997240	3001800	and the penny arcade auction dinner and all kinds of stuff boom loud happened this week
3001800	3005880	and I'm unfortunately I didn't get to talk about it because I was unable to attend some
3005880	3009920	things in real life came up and it was one of those real life greater than video games
3009920	3015420	type of thing even when it's for a good cause which really is disappointing but that's what
3015420	3019560	happens when you live a hundred miles away from where the funds at so I wanted to go
3019560	3026560	but I had my algebra final I hear women really well though I hear we're like even I'm hearing
3026560	3031360	it was better than last year which last year I had a lot of fun so I'm I'm I'm really happy
3031360	3035700	to hear it and of course hearing about all this money that was made just collectively
3035700	3040880	amongst all the efforts of not just even the big stuff but the little stuff too that's
3040880	3047240	that's great and you know it's unfortunate that CNN won't report this but they'll talk
3047240	3053080	about the Xbox gamer that beat up a special needs child for his Xbox this which yes was
3053080	3057200	a story on this show about six months ago I think it's because good news doesn't you
3057200	3062700	know the more negative hype they raise the more chances they have of getting news out
3062700	3070700	of it you know and that's really pathetic it's just pitiful but this I think you know
3070700	3078640	they're there the next goal is working on I think 1.7 million from last year so I think
3078640	3082360	that they're still looking to reach that by the end of the year that would be great if
3082360	3086160	they could top what they did last year considering the state of the world and the economy and
3086160	3091360	all that that's a very aggressive goal but I think just taking all that into consideration
3091360	3096160	I think it's great that they've made it as far as they have I agree I definitely agree
3096160	3106040	I'm very pleased so there you go alright moving on Loki yeah I don't know the thing is this
3106040	3116160	is kind of ridiculous but they have added quests now on was it the PlayStation Network
3116160	3123440	for the rewards program and these quests are basically get you test out different things
3123440	3130840	for example they have one of the quests you can do kind of thing as like achievement check
3130840	3137580	your pulse which requires you to watch an episode of pulse on the PlayStation Network
3137580	3146400	or to play a PlayStation move game and you get the move it quest or the no place like
3146400	3150860	home quest which involves you visiting the central plaza and PlayStation home so will
3150860	3155600	I get like well if I successfully completed quest will my PlayStation 3 go it's dangerous
3155600	3161000	to go alone here take this and like give me candy or maybe a letter to take to the old
3161000	3169640	woman so that she'll sell me you know drinks well I don't know I I just have a laugh when
3169640	3175960	I saw this because it's like you know I can see when the quest mean find a purpose go
3175960	3185000	visit home because there is no purpose or really you know it's was it a salt it's really
3185000	3192020	awesome or sodium one I'm sorry yeah it just sounds like that they've that home is so useless
3192020	3197320	that they've added a layer of meta gaming on top of it just so that you logged on you
3197320	3208000	sat down just I don't know don't get dry hopped by you for the furry exactly damn dark Tetsuya
3208000	3215140	says so when will olr start giving out quests okay go leave a five-star review for the show
3215140	3223040	on iTunes and you get a sticker go tell something nice about olr to a friend of yours and get
3223040	3232080	a high-five get permabanned by dark Sakura feet of strength you can only do it once no
3232080	3237400	no no that's we don't want them to achieve that you don't want somebody to achieve that
3237400	3241640	I don't know that anyone's ever pissed me off to get permabanned yes yeah I have well
3241640	3248920	I know they have one person I permabanned I think there might be two I think the person
3248920	3258000	I didn't permabanned them I just well whatever anyway my point is so so what is the reward
3258000	3262560	is the reward just a virtual like trophy style thing or do I actually get like I don't know
3262560	3269440	like a discount on a game or a I don't know a certificate in the mail a spot on the cast
3269440	3277800	of tester three what well what the PlayStation rewards are is you get free PlayStation or
3277800	3284960	bonuses and apparently they're for fans they didn't really say I don't think what the bonuses
3284960	3294720	were it says tiger rewards free it says they'll be open the PlayStation over regards the plus
3294720	3301320	status it think of it like Club Nintendo or screening Square Enix members PlayStation
3301320	3305860	rewards is tiered separating its members into three groups select pro and legendary playing
3305860	3311000	games downloading demos using PlayStation home being active in the PlayStation.com forums
3311000	3315560	and then I guess at the end of the year something they'll say okay this tier gets this this
3315560	3320640	tier gets that this tier gets this and be done with it deathwishings wants to know how
3320640	3327360	do you sign up I believe you do if I want to say they have their own dedicated website
3327360	3333720	to that take a look here meanwhile while you're looking for that Tiger Claw in our time says
3333720	3338520	I think you would get a perma ban if you left a one-star review so don't know you won't
3338520	3342000	get a perma ban but I'm gonna bring sure me over to your house and start talking about
3342000	3350260	the tester that's what I'll do excellent in our chat room hypothesizes that you get assigned
3350260	3357480	autograph of Kevin Butler I'm not sure it doesn't really say what it is because I don't
3357480	3363960	think it's fully launched it it's still in beta so right now you have to they say you
3363960	3370520	have to be a highly-engaged member well I don't know if it's PlayStation Plus it says
3370520	3375180	you have to be a highly engaged PlayStation owner meaning you got to be posting on their
3375180	3383400	forums and playing home some similar features as PlayStation Plus says the only difference
3383400	3388120	I guess it is reward is free I don't know it's it's just a gimmick to get you to try
3388120	3391720	all the stuff that they have out there like renting videos and stuff like that they want
3391720	3397440	to try that no thanks you know steam has something similar ish going on right now it's not quite
3397440	3402120	as as you know bold as you know trying to get you to go into home and all that stuff
3402120	3406880	but they have like these quest thing going on right now where you play certain games
3406880	3410320	and once you get like actual achievements like I think one of them was for the game
3410320	3414440	droplets you had to get a certain amount of points and that was like one of four options
3414440	3419480	but one of the other options was sign up for an official games fan club so one of them
3419480	3422440	was something you didn't have to actually own in a game to do and then like other ones
3422440	3428320	would be things and I think what they do like they draw a name it's a scavenger hunt yeah
3428320	3432220	that's what it was like scavenger hunt and then like they draw a name from all the people
3432220	3436480	who have submitted badges you get like what is it like a hundred free games or some shit
3436480	3441640	crazy that they do on steam with their sales so it's this sounds similar except for the
3441640	3446560	fact that steam I know what I'll get like if I do enough of these I get free games yay
3446560	3451040	oh there you go.
3451040	3454040	Other stuff going on on other consoles how about the Wii we haven't had a lot of Wii
3454040	3459400	news tonight and the uDraw game tablet came out not that long ago and we were kind of
3459400	3462600	wondering if it was going to be a hit or a miss it sounds like it might actually have
3462600	3466600	been a hit THQ has said that they are going to continue to support the uDraw Wii through
3466600	3473400	2012 the chief financial officer Paul Pashino started to kind of give us some specifics
3473400	3479040	as to what that was going to include at the UBS global media and communications conference
3479040	3484160	he said that four to five titles will arrive from THQ in the next fiscal year meaning April
3484160	3490760	to April so April 11 to March 2012 however you don't know exactly what games are coming
3490760	3501120	out except there will be a SpongeBob SquarePants game there you go so there it is otherwise
3501120	3507380	as far as the other games go we don't know yet stop asking if it's Mario Paint just stop
3507380	3513200	we want to see it happen too but seriously we haven't heard anything like that yet so
3513200	3520300	just let it go let it go oh Mario Paint but it better have the music mode in it that was
3520300	3530360	awesome-tastic well how about something different how about connect sound like fun sure I haven't
3530360	3537800	touched mine in a week well the the tech firm that made the camera sensor actually released
3537800	3544840	open source drivers for the connect and that way means that basically you can do pretty
3544840	3553680	much whatever you want with it it's developed put out I think they said that is the prime
3553680	3560000	sense which is the company that did it there is really that's really cool anyway has set
3560000	3564320	up all kinds of stuff out there for it so that'd be pretty cool it's the open and I
3564320	3572760	framework has an API for writing and I apps and offers middleware that allows RGB D sensors
3572760	3578840	like the connect and let you use it so these connect hack stories are kind of a dime a
3578840	3583280	dozen now I mean that you know everybody's hacked their connect 10 ways from Sunday I'm
3583280	3587520	kind of curious what this means like okay so there's an open source connect driver that's
3587520	3593560	cool so indie game developers could use this sort of thing but this doesn't mean anything
3593560	3598440	official can happen right because an official company would not be able to use an open source
3598440	3603080	connect driver and expect to have their game embraced by Microsoft Microsoft already said
3603080	3608400	they were excited to see what my really be able to do as long as they stayed in the law
3608400	3615040	real okay that's interesting then with that coming to mind do you think there's the possibility
3615040	3621720	we could see like a actual you know big game publisher try to do something with connect
3621720	3628220	on the PC maybe but I'm more thinking that they're leaving it open for the indie type
3628220	3634600	stuff happening on PC I'm also kind of surprised though that with connect being like that must
3634600	3638840	have holiday toy that they're not letting it embrace the PC side a little more I mean
3638840	3643840	I get it they're not doing that because they want to sell more xboxes that's what's going
3643840	3651160	on but I'm still kind of surprised they're not outside of this one comment it's not being
3651160	3656980	a little more embraced because imagine if you know the people at whatever sales store
3656980	3662120	like Gamestop or whatever could more openly advertise hey this device it runs on your
3662120	3670400	360 and your PC you can play biggest loser with Jillian Michaels on your PC woo my thought
3670400	3675680	is that Microsoft is actually going to have some sort of cross-promotion going on between
3675680	3681340	a PC side and do something that's already optimized for PC or at least quote optimized
3681340	3686360	for PC so that they can get more sales out of it but then again my other thought too
3686360	3691200	is that if they were going to do that then the holiday season would have been the time
3691200	3695800	I maybe next holiday because I think this holiday they want to sell xboxes gaming on
3695800	3704120	PC in their eyes I don't think is very huge people do it but it's not like you know it's
3704120	3708240	not like you have PCs in your living room but don't they keep trying with the games
3708240	3713760	for Windows relaunches yeah but that's different though that people have laptops and people
3713760	3719640	game on laptops you know or whatever on the go or when they're traveling or you know maybe
3719640	3724240	even at home and stuff but they're not going to have like the Kinect that requires you
3724240	3729800	to have some sort of camera and most people do not have PCs hooked to their TVs in their
3729800	3734640	living room there's that's why they want console there because they they're trying to sell
3734640	3739840	that kind of experience for people I don't think that they're really going to have this
3739840	3744980	they may have similar technology down the line or something that may be built into something
3744980	3751960	like a all-in-one PC or like a laptop or something where you can do different gestures to navigate
3751960	3758500	around crap maybe like a new Windows Media Center or something like that but I don't
3758500	3764720	think they're going to actually try to push the Kinect for a PC market unless unless they
3764720	3768080	did have some sort of like you were saying for one of those because you know Vista has
3768080	3773640	all this ease of access stuff built in I mean they could technically have well they had
3773640	3778120	already created I'm not saying that Microsoft did this but there was already a device that
3778120	3786760	technically read brain patterns so that someone could think type you know what I mean and
3786760	3793360	yeah it took them you know two minutes to write an entire sentence but if they had the
3793360	3799600	Kinect technology set up for say that you've got a quadriplegic you know they can maybe
3799600	3804880	move their head that would be the perfect type of accessibility and open up you know
3804880	3810640	a universe to people who didn't have that opportunity before and that that's another
3810640	3813480	reason why I'm actually glad to see that I like to see those types of things come out
3813480	3818840	and not just you know get a little hacks.
3818840	3823400	Let's see, I'm going to the chat room at chat.orangeworm.com.
3823400	3827920	Game Guru says I'm still trying to find an Xbox 360 controller for the PC and not resort
3827920	3829840	to a cord.
3829840	3831560	It's difficult to do but you can do it.
3831560	3835940	It's called an Xbox 360 wireless gaming receiver.
3835940	3845200	You can buy these it's a little dongle for your PC and it doesn't just work with the
3845200	3849480	controllers it works with the wireless adapter too if you have one of the Xbox 360 wireless
3849480	3854960	voice adapters because that was actually my Warcraft chat for quite a long time I used
3854960	3861240	one of those so if you are really against cords which I don't see why oh Loki even has
3861240	3865480	one he's holding up right here in studio that he's using do I is there like a little barcode
3865480	3870480	on the back of this or anything no it's called the Microsoft Xbox 360 wireless receiver for
3870480	3873680	Windows would you take a picture of that and put it on our lovely orangewormsradio.com
3873680	3874680	blog?
3874680	3878360	They're good for wireless controllers which I use in my laptop.
3878360	3883640	Yep so that's what you need I'm looking at frugal right now they're about 20 bucks on
3883640	3888440	various websites so take a peek I don't know if they make them officially anymore I think
3888440	3893040	you have to buy them no they still do do they yeah they just might be a little bit harder
3893040	3896840	to find you can find them at any store that sells games like a GameStop maybe not that
3896840	3902920	hard to find all right let's move on to some release dates around the world we'll start
3902920	3909200	with the US is it dried up now is are we done with the big holiday releases Loki yes here's
3909200	3916440	what we got new fitness first yoga and Pilates on the Wii and learn science on the DS done
3916440	3921760	wow that's it that is it I guess that's just because is there anything coming out between
3921760	3927160	now and the official holiday that is it I guess that's it your holiday games are out
3927160	3930420	all right well let's see if the story is a little bit different in Japan there are still
3930420	3934720	some big releases to go in Japan one of them's coming out this week on the 360 Castlevania
3934720	3941040	Lords of Shadow gets its Japanese release this week on the 16th Final Fantasy 13 international
3941040	3945520	comes into the ultimate hits collection in Japan this week so that's pretty cool as well
3945520	3951000	as Gundam muso 3 and skate 3 all of those getting releases in Japan this week deca sports
3951000	3957560	freedom as well and Call of Duty black ops dubbed edition all of those cut this is actually
3957560	3962440	a pretty big week in Japan on the PlayStation 3 many of those same games Call of Duty dubbed
3962440	3967240	Castlevania Lords of Shadow going to move so there actually is a PlayStation console
3967240	3971700	bundle coming out with Lords of Shadow this week as well because they love bundles over
3971700	3977000	there sports champions for the move comes out this week as well and one other game Ume
3977000	3987400	Niko no Naku Koro ni Majo 2-3 no Rinbu Kyoku comes out this week I have no idea what this
3987400	3992320	is although one of the screenshots Heka looks like Phoenix Wright it says it's like the
3992320	3997380	PC version I guess this is an adapter or an adaption of the PC version it's an adventure
3997380	4004100	novel adaptation but that does not look like Phoenix Wright objection oh yuck there's a
4004100	4009960	girl who got stabbed with something this does kind of seem like a crime type game or something
4009960	4014680	maybe it's a different company's answer to Phoenix Wright I don't know maybe maybe moving
4014680	4019720	on to other consoles on the Nintendo Wii monopoly here and now the world edition because I know
4019720	4023920	you're all looking forward to that gets a price reduction this week pack man party comes
4023920	4031500	out this week as well as shape boxing 2 we day enjoy diet that's really the name you
4031500	4038000	guys really the name going on to the PSP shining hearts this week from Sega's the big release
4038000	4043160	on the PSP otherwise a variety of games are getting a price reduction like a sugetsu portable
4043160	4050280	and so forth there it is your Japanese releases well for our friends in the UK I've just got
4050280	4057260	three things sack boys prehistoric moves on ps3 that's on the 15th on the 16th world of
4057260	4063960	goo for iPad and on the 18th battlefield bad company to Vietnam which is a whole whopping
4063960	4071520	three days before the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 release it all right kind of a slow people
4071520	4075840	slow gaming week unless you're in Japan I guess all right and even then it's mostly
4075840	4080120	localizations of stuff that for a change came out in the US first as opposed to the other
4080120	4086840	way around Loki has another story for us and so do I and we're gonna get to the classic
4086840	4091200	game of the week where dark soccer's gonna pull a game from the archives and I will say
4091200	4096020	she did go way back in the archives this week and it's it's a game that even I remember
4096020	4101840	and I used to like to which is I'll tell you this much is a Sega game surprise but it's
4101840	4108680	one that I remember and so we'll get to that in a minute Loki well there's still more progress
4108680	4115160	going on in Australia to approve a new rating for video games to allow adult themed video
4115160	4123720	games to be released in Australia I had already passed the federal cabinet and they've approved
4123720	4132200	that but now it's in the hands of the committee of attorneys generals and apparently they
4132200	4140420	right now have some they haven't made a decision regarding it yet apparently they said that
4140420	4148880	gamers have grown and we have a deal we have to deal with the convergence of film and games
4148880	4153120	and basically right now they haven't really come to a conclusion whether going to pass
4153120	4158440	it or not but I mean it's the federal cabinet thinks it's okay and you know gamers think
4158440	4165920	it's okay so we'll just have to see it's about our time I think they should mean hell if
4165920	4172480	anything you know Australia always seems to have like the cliche you know menly men and
4172480	4176920	you know they're tough in the Thunder from Down Under is that what you're talking about
4176920	4182640	or not like not necessarily that but I don't know it just seems kind of Rob that's a dish
4182640	4190320	it out back Astroper review which I think is what he was referring to but isn't asked
4190320	4195200	Australia also the country that bans a lot of games outright like I seem to remember
4195200	4203360	they have this if this goes in place and they will have a way to classify those games solar
4203360	4207880	flare in our time says oh I heard about this on zero punctuation guy made a big fuss about
4207880	4213240	it doesn't make a big fuss about everything that was kind of a joke that's what I thought
4213240	4218360	alright moving on to another story this has to do with the VGA is of course where last
4218360	4225480	night the video game awards on Spike TV and you know what I'm over it like I don't really
4225480	4228520	watch it because I know all the news is going to hit the internet five minutes later which
4228520	4234160	is exactly what I thought they were today but whatever whoops I want to see just because
4234160	4238200	Neil Patrick Harris is gonna be hosting and he's awesome how can they make the VGA is
4238200	4243720	more tolerable more Neil Patrick Harris that that's true but also I think they should just
4243720	4249600	stop trying to make it cool because when people who don't like there's so many people I think
4249600	4255200	to try to make the VGA is cool like you know this is cool you guys we're gonna we're gonna
4255200	4259200	do this really cool segment of a dick and fart joke it's gonna be really funny they're
4259200	4262300	just trying it's like you don't know anything about video they're just trying to make it
4262300	4266720	like the MTV Movie Awards and that's and you know what's sad is they do a better job than
4266720	4273880	G fordas this is G for you even on anymore not if you're on direct TV no no no I understand
4273880	4277480	that but I'm saying do they even have their award show anymore I don't think they do we
4277480	4283080	just scared sure me out with the talk of G for I think that got relegated to a segment
4283080	4288680	on X play was what happened unless you for you now is you know best episodes of cheaters
4288680	4296160	all right well there were some pretty big stories that came out of the VGA is even though
4296160	4301620	you know most of it was like just little teases just just little teases like I know something
4301620	4308840	you don't know but what are the big trailers of course was Elder Scrolls V Skyrim not a
4308840	4313640	damn piece of gameplay in the trailer just some dragon waking up and you know narration
4313640	4319420	which but that was enough for me to go what was the dragon waking up in narration going
4319420	4327480	girl I'm a dragon I'm waking up for another Elder Scrolls game that's right oh yeah that's
4327480	4332540	exactly actually what it sounded like no here I'll play I happen to have a link to the trailer
4332540	4339480	right here let me see if I can play a dragon y'all I'm waking up how's it going nothing
4339480	4346520	like that stop it well this girls yeah hold on I'm trying to play some of the trailer
4346520	4351960	here and the stupid websites like what's your date of birth because the content here no
4351960	4355560	it's not really the world premiere here you guys let's see if I can can I jump forward
4355560	4366420	and like just play I hate live radio sometimes half the buffer this is stupid there you go
4366420	4386900	see look stone stuff and a Bethesda logo and really passionate narration anyhow there it
4386900	4391840	is it's coming out in November 11 2011 that's what they announced is the release day good
4391840	4397120	luck meeting that release day just saying these ads always very specific release date
4397120	4402120	and not something that they made to get you know plan a gimmick of a you know year or
4402120	4406600	anything like that dark Tetsuya says Loki should totally be the voice of a gay dragon
4406600	4414100	in a video game yes he should I like this as a grassroots campaign no Loki you need
4414100	4419920	to be a gay dragon it was just a has anyone watched Family Guy you have something again
4419920	4424360	do they not do they not know of like was it the one guy who talks in there all the time
4424360	4431560	like hey I'm a bee you know I'm not sting you oh I've stung myself that's all I was
4431560	4437100	mocking I mean I am not playing a gay dragon in anything that's dumb that's just like people
4437100	4441360	trying to get me to be the voice of tingle no not gonna happen yeah I enjoy dressing
4441360	4445880	up like tingle or anything that has to do with tingle because that character is retarded
4445880	4450000	if they make some sort of epic Mickey type game with all the Nintendo characters and
4450000	4456080	yeah he'll be in there with what was that captain rainbow yeah anybody remember captain
4456080	4462000	rainbow yeah I didn't think so I enjoyed the Family Guy parody of aliens that had that
4462000	4467200	character in it oh you're trying to escape with that little girl I'm gonna bite you with
4467200	4476520	my second face now oh no it's the airlock oh no I have to see that no maybe salacious
4476520	4480360	pop needs to be the gay dragon would you be a gay dragon salacious pop he's nodding he'd
4480360	4486560	do the gay dragon here you go all right uh and tiger claw is saying isn't it 11-1-11
4486560	4491920	which is a Tuesday it's not gonna come out then anyway it's gonna get delayed these games
4491920	4496080	always do here's the thing though despite the fact that the trailer didn't show us really
4496080	4500320	anything new I'm just happy that it wasn't a trailer for a multiplayer Elder Scrolls
4500320	4505360	Oblivion don't get me wrong that would have been kind of cool like four years ago but
4505360	4510280	now it's time to move on to a new game so I'm uh I'm excited also some other things
4510280	4514320	that were revealed at the VGA is there's going to be a Mortal Kombat game on the PlayStation
4514320	4519480	3 oh wait we already knew that but this trailer had Kratos in it that's right Kratos is going
4519480	4525580	to be a playable character in Mortal Kombat on the ps3 so now him and scorpion can just
4525580	4530040	keep driving hooks into each other it'll be fun which is exact you know and whenever all
4530040	4536120	they need is pinhead from hellraiser to come out and it'll be hooktastic I you know when
4536120	4541040	I heard the news that Kratos was in it that was captain hook that was exactly the uh the
4541040	4544680	thought that came to my mind was get over here no you get over here get over here go
4544680	4549820	and sir I will take you both to hell that's what the trailer was was him and scorpion
4549820	4556760	fighting oh and mass effect 3 and there was a trailer for it and uh it's coming out holiday
4556760	4564480	2011 and I'm sure a lot of fanboy excitement going on over that one because mass effect
4564480	4571360	is a very popular series there it is anyhow uh let's get into the classic game of the
4571360	4576940	week it's a segment here on the show we can take a look at gaming's past you know screw
4576940	4585320	this elder scrolls 5 jib jab and all this uh you know talk of Kratos kids newfound fangled

4596040	4608520	in monster land it was put out by westone it came out on the master system it was in
4608520	4614840	the arcades um in 1987 but it came out on the master system in 1988 um uh Activision
4614840	4620300	released it for the Amiga in 87 it came out on Commodore 64 the armstrad CPC ZX Spectrum
4620300	4628280	and Atari ST in 1989 um it came it was titled super wonder boy monster world in Japan and
4628280	4634960	then super wonder boy in monster land in Europe my cartridge of this says super wonder boy
4634960	4642520	super monster land so inconsistent I don't know um it actually was retooled um for the
4642520	4650400	Famicom by uh Jaleco and it was uh redone as a version of journey to the west um Hudson
4650400	4657080	soft um brought it out for Famicom and PC Engine to be like a big hoodie man I guess
4657080	4666000	uh it came out um in Brazil as uh Monica no Castello though drag I guess I don't speak
4666000	4673000	Portuguese but I do know that they speak Portuguese in Brazil okay um and it was actually based
4673000	4678760	off of the Monica's gang comics that were in Brazil and it came out on mobile phones
4678760	4684920	in 2005 and for the virtual console in 2008 in Japan in 2009 over here in Europe it was
4684920	4691000	a sequel to the 1986 game wonder boy and it's 11 years after that game where everything
4691000	4702260	is peaceful and the evil king tom tom uh basically uh was gone and then uh wonder boy a fire
4702260	4709880	breeding dragon showed up and uh basically uh wanted to go in and conquer wonderland
4709880	4714220	putting it into monster land and crap happened so wonder boy popped up and he's like okay
4714220	4721360	I'll kill the mecha dragon whatever so anyway a lot of this is like I never cared about
4721360	4730080	the story when I was playing this I was like yeah got a sword so anyway um it uh had some
4730080	4735920	slow uh load times on the computers had some issues but it was super fun the master system
4735920	4744280	version is indeed the best home version that there is in my opinion that of many others
4744280	4750800	so um the way that it plays is you actually start off in the city of wonder without anything
4750800	4756240	um but the city's mayor gives you a sword and a revival potion and off you go it has
4756240	4763240	12 levels each of them have its own neat features and monsters and crap you use a d-pad to move
4763240	4767640	around and you got magic weapons that you can select and all kinds of skipping and jumping
4767640	4774440	and smiting things you have a life meter that starts uh that is uh red hearts and more you
4774440	4778400	can build them up as you go you start off with five and when you hit damage they turn
4778400	4786760	black kind of like zelda and you can get gold by uh killing things because apparently when
4786760	4792360	monsters die they barf gold or um you can hit trees and clouds because gold hangs out
4792360	4798680	in clouds all the time you also have an hourglass timer and when the hourglass runs out wonder
4798680	4802400	boy starts losing life but you can refill it by collecting more hourglasses in hospitals
4802400	4807080	or taverns because that's always where i look for my hourglasses is with some beer or sick
4807080	4811320	people of course of course gold hangs out in clouds where do the golden showers come
4811320	4819120	from on the zx spectrum version you had a candle for your timer for the master system
4819120	4824960	version you had a status screen so it's just to show you what you got how much uh gold
4824960	4829760	you have what your armor your equipment because i carry a status screen around with me all
4829760	4835360	the time too um i just usually whenever you see me drowning out it's usually i'm looking
4835360	4840360	at my status screen going damn i need more stuff um you also have the uh magic weapons
4840360	4846080	like i said before you have bombs that roll on the ground and fireballs and tornadoes
4846080	4851160	because i also carry tornadoes in my pocket and a thunder flash that damages everything
4851160	4857200	on the screen um so basically there's lots of little secret stuff in there it looks like
4857200	4864560	the character also in his weakest form is wandering around in a diaper yes all this
4864560	4870880	talk of golden showers and diapers is making me very sick just but it is one of the earlier
4870880	4876960	um roleplay games action adventure roleplay it was pretty fun came out on a bunch of stuff
4876960	4884000	like i said before and wonder boy in monster land is one of the uh i'd say one of the top
4884000	4889800	uh master system games and and really not surprised you know that it got its own special
4889800	4896680	release in brazil because they love the master system in brazil oh my gosh seriously there's
4896680	4903600	like like so many sega games were retooled like genesis games even were retooled to come
4903600	4913120	out on the master system because they love the master system in brazil um it it did really
4913120	4920760	well um got some pretty high uh ratings for uh like the lowest of its ratings were the
4920760	4927320	amiga followed by the commodore 64 master system though really really hit the top of
4927320	4934840	the the top of the chart and uh there were other games came out you know along the same
4934840	4940800	lines monster boy the wonder boy monster land though i'd have to put that up at pinnacle
4940800	4949000	all right and you know what i'm gonna check my status screen now there it is your classic
4949000	4954240	game of the week wonder boy in monster land arkadian i know you like the sega games you
4954240	4957680	have any fond memories of this one i've only played this one a little bit the thing is
4957680	4963440	i played before i played this one i played the third one once you are it's like the monster
4963440	4967980	boy third that's a monster boy uh wonder boy three the dragon's trap which is actually
4967980	4972520	one of my favorite games into a dragon i don't know if you i don't know isn't like right
4972520	4975380	at the start of the game you get turned into a monster yeah yeah it is because yeah you're
4975380	4979000	fully powered up at the beginning and then they once you defeat like defeat the dragon
4979000	4982760	there he puts a curse on you so you basically turn it into something yeah and then you have
4982760	4988720	to turn it into various other other creatures for the whole game and y'all yeah so that's
4988720	4992200	definitely you should look into that game for the future this is what i've got to play
4992200	4995720	this one a little bit and it's kind of hard at the beginning this is one of the cartridge
4995720	4998980	by the way and take a picture of it this is one of the few master system games i remember
4998980	5003100	playing that's why i was kind of excited to see this as the pick now some of the chatters

5225640	5233060	3 drake's deception is coming out now we know that it's coming out sometime in 2011 my guess
5233060	5240500	would be the fall and um apparently the game will fate will feature drake and partners
5240500	5246580	sully uh hunt for a lost city and journey that leads them to the arabian peninsula and
5246580	5253500	rubel cali desert and uh they said that the story not only lists from the life of sir
5253500	5262420	francis drake but also the british army officer and archaeologists te lawrence as in arabia
5262420	5267260	and uh this was kind of shown off a little bit um during the vga's and also they had
5267260	5272820	a preview in entertainment weekly that's crossing over for you now isn't it and of course you
5272820	5281020	know the movie that's gonna suck because mark fortunately mark walberg can be a good actor
5281020	5286140	sometimes and sometimes he can't act his way out he was in that movie the happening that
5286140	5292780	is all i have to say but he was good in um he ran from the wind loki okay but he was
5292780	5297380	good in another movie though uh nights no not that wasn't his peen just so you know
5297380	5302380	you know you know what he actually um the best thing i've ever seen him do was his uh
5302380	5306340	interview on top gear there was a movie where he was with uh leonardo dicaprio or something
5306340	5312220	like that um it was like some mobster i'll take your word for it but he was good in that
5312220	5320940	but yeah happening kind of wish it didn't happen but the riff track is awesome seriously
5320940	5327900	if you got to watch that movie once in your life watch it with the riff tracks um other
5327900	5335540	fun stuff and this is um kind of cool because it's been out on the pc and um the we but
5335540	5341780	now playstation 3 owners will get the chance to play strong grads cool game for attractive
5341780	5351700	people uh be coming out on um december 21st and it's also coming to mac as well um doesn't
5351700	5356460	really say what the pricing is going to be yet but apparently um you know they're saying
5356460	5363140	in comparison the pc right now all five episodes are um on sale for 29.95 so something maybe
5363140	5370100	around that price um that's kind of cool and then finally just you know rama is screaming
5370100	5375180	in the chat that the departed was a good movie that was the part yes that's the one that

5384800	5390180	coming to xbox live arcade on december 15th so you can uh check that out it's very similar

5398980	5406300	because i actually really like quake good times so if you want to get fragged you have
5406300	5411060	to let me know any other like special features coming with that or is it just like a straight
5411060	5418900	up port of quake 3 or what it looks a little different um it's kind of it it doesn't really
5418900	5423740	say if it's going to be a little different i thought it was going to be kind of similar
5423740	5428980	to the one that they have right now like the uh browser game but maybe not i don't know

5672460	5682900	pack for rock band yay will it have we didn't start the fire in it let's see it's actually
5682900	5688760	a big combination it's billy joel the hits rock band edition big shot captain jack is
5688760	5693980	still rock and roll to me moving out the only only the good die young piano man pressures
5693980	5698340	say goodbye to hollywood the entertainer the stranger we didn't start the fire you may
5698340	5706980	be right and there are um i think which one has the expansion pressure has the uh pro
5706980	5713700	base expansion available so you know what there's a song that i should send you it's
5713700	5717740	the best recording of it i have weird al one of his live songs is it still billy joel to
5717740	5724780	me nice yeah i also speaking of billy joel there's this random warcraft video out there
5724780	5730220	where they did like the lyrics to we didn't start the fire but it's like the characters
5730220	5734980	running through storm wind that was dumb yeah it it's more of one of those things where
5734980	5739980	you go wow this is really dumb but a lot of work went into this really dumb project that
5739980	5745860	they pulled off pretty well i don't know uh salacious pop was was over when i was playing
5745860	5751180	it and you could hear the song playing and he was like ah you watching that video yeah
5751180	5755660	i knew exactly what it was when you started playing by the way that is the proper response
5755660	5760780	for that video and i was like i know exactly what that is it's not that great it's kind
5760780	5765100	of cool they got 60 people to waste an hour while someone ran frat and it wasn't even
5765100	5769580	60 people it was a bunch of just different people because you saw them like running because
5769580	5778780	they had time to get to the new next position yeah yeah yeah sorry dark soccer i just was
5778780	5783060	mesmerized by the next story well you're going to share with our listeners you're just going
5783060	5787380	to sit there and watch it um the next two characters that are going to be out for marvel
5787380	5792420	vs capcom 3 is crimson viper and storm and i don't give a shit about crimson viper because
5792420	5799700	crimson viper stands for cheap bitch but storm cool and it's even her uh more current comic
5799700	5805860	book outfit too so uh this is uh pretty awesome even though right now magneto's kicking her
5805860	5813860	in the face um also storm has a very impressive rack in this game so that's important yes
5813860	5818860	yes it is very important but of course it's looked like that her attacks might be actual
5818860	5827020	actually uh taken from um her old uh x-men versus street fighter just completely done
5827020	5833460	up and made incredible it's really pretty her uh ice storm attack is really really nice

5871500	5877340	one one one but uh the nintendo one was rad except for the triangle jump the triangle
5877340	5881340	jump can burn in hell for eternity but the the whole difference between that one and
5881340	5885760	the arcade slash genesis slash everything else version is that the nest one was based
5885760	5893780	off of the comics that came out the straighter here you manga so i'm i'm wow and dude black
5893780	5899380	spider-man that's awesome okay so how about some uh other other other other news and this

5957800	5967240	a ton of the quests so go up date fallout new vegas all right let's get to the twitter
5967240	5973340	topics let's go check the tweeter and uh see what folks are tweeting us this week twitter.com
5973340	5978020	slash olr if you want to interact with the show you want to say hey the twitter is a
5978020	5981400	good way to do that let's start with a tweet from blue swim tonight you remember blue swim
5981400	5987860	was the techno kitten adventure tweet that started that whole stuff all right this tweet
5987860	5991160	probably won't inspire an interview but it's interesting nonetheless it has to do with
5991160	5999620	a connect flying machine that's right apparently it's this whole thing where you do this mini
5999620	6005420	you have this mini copter and it sees itself in the connect and it avoids obstacles by
6005420	6010020	detecting them on the connect and it knows its own altitude it's crazy i guess there's
6010020	6014540	a backup motion capture device involved in everything but there's a youtube i have to
6014540	6018400	mute santa there for a minute so we can look at the youtube here in studio of this thing
6018400	6023160	in motion and i guess you can kind of actually see like how the connect senses things around
6023160	6028640	and now there there goes the copter it's flying all by its lonesome and i guess this guy's
6028640	6031680	going to take a cardboard tube and like try to whack it out of the air but it's going
6031680	6035720	to know that it's there and it'll say like oh i better fly away from that he's not trying
6035720	6042980	hard enough yeah he needs to be faster you could do like real baseball with this have
6042980	6047120	a baseball just floating in mid-air and then just flack right through the tv more like
6047120	6053560	t-ball maybe in this case k-ball t-ball i like that all right anyhow back to santa
6053560	6063920	do do do do do do uh let's see uh other tweets blue swim wants to know if we're if any of
6063920	6073960	us are going to pick up the super mario all-stars we port no anybody anybody if someone gives
6073960	6079000	it to me i'm sorry i can't wait to buy the mario game what you mean the new one no all
6079000	6090560	of them again and again forever uh some stuff from spazzinator is tweeting us to know uh
6090560	6095440	number one two quick notes for us number one i'd recommend that everyone catch the last
6095440	6100960	episode of fng live next friday it's a good show imho actually i don't want to sound like
6100960	6106360	debbie downer i thought it was already over but if it's not then yes you should um go
6106360	6110600	support our buddy bobby because i know he's worked very hard on that project and it's
6110600	6114680	a bummer but you know what they say all good things dot dot dot was the last episode of
6114680	6120360	star trek uh spazzinator also says as self-serving as it sounds and seeing that there's no official
6120360	6126480	blog posting for it follow me on twitter for news on psn video freebies you know you should
6126480	6131720	instead of doing it through your twitter dude get like a blog spot or a tumblr or something
6131720	6140680	and any idiot can have a blog look at us we have a podcast just go on itunes itunes is
6140680	6146040	living proof that any idiot can podcast you can do better than twitter spazzinator i know
6146040	6152840	you can i believe in you do you believe in spazzinator huh yeah yeah all right yes whatever
6152840	6158080	you just said rob no that was that was perfect that was fine funny t-man wants to uh link
6158080	6164780	us to look i found a techno kitten rip off oh my god the clone games i guess are starting
6164780	6170300	now there's a game on uh xbox live any marketplace that he links us to again this is funny t-man
6170300	6180640	on twitter called asteroids do concern me what and that's actually that was one of
6180640	6185960	the uh indie games that they had um oh i see some of the levels are serious but there's
6185960	6190080	like this third level here that's unicorns and pooping rainbows that's one of the ones
6190080	6193900	that they showed um you know as part of the indie games push that they're doing remember
6193900	6201620	right now um yeah it looked interesting so is there like a raver puppy odyssey game coming
6201620	6207100	out or something or no but it can it should that would be awesome let's see i'm looking
6207100	6214720	at the official trailer for asteroids do concern me let's see here waiting to see some gameplay
6214720	6219800	here we go oh this looks like the same type of thing where you use the button to float
6219800	6227620	up and down it just moves really fast and you collect orbs i have to admit this actually
6227620	6233300	looks a little more advanced than uh techno getting adventure where's the meowing but
6233300	6239220	i guess there's oh there's some cute little modes what's this okay double rainbow double
6239220	6249860	rainbow course what does it mean hey rob that one's cool doodle mode no no no it's awesome
6249860	6253300	though about that whole that game right there is part of that trailer where they're like
6253300	6258860	yeah we're sick of the people cloning games out there and they show off the games that
6258860	6262300	they have and the ones that they're pushing a lot of them are clones of other things but
6262300	6266900	see here's the thing you know why you can't call asteroids do concern me a rip off because
6266900	6271700	it's missing two very very very important things yes the gameplay is the same but here's
6271700	6277460	the thing techno and kittens it's that's right it's missing adventure you might say it's
6277460	6284420	missing adventure happy hardcore
6284420	6285420	everybody rave
6285420	6305180	you guys let's drop some e and make out oh my gosh you guys yay let's make some candy
6305180	6311000	i'll trade you this candy necklace for your candy wristband and then a big gust of wind
6311000	6319140	gets caught in their jenko pants wide like james may blow off
6319140	6325380	tiger claw 305 sends us some tweets blockbuster laughed at a netflix partnership proposal
6325380	6330140	in 2000 isn't it always funny you get these hindsight is 2020 stories and it's kind of
6330140	6334580	like look who's laughing now this is the story i think it is it was a part of the deal was
6334580	6341980	that the netflix brand had to remain and blockbuster was like no if we do anything it's got to
6341980	6348580	have the blockbuster name on it we don't think this is a viable way of delivering rentals
6348580	6353660	fail they thought it was a very small niche business this is just this is just some flash
6353660	6358340	in the pan that's gonna go away tvds over the mail come on that's like groceries to
6358340	6365620	your door this is some web van shit no no that's on the inner webs that's just college
6365620	6372820	kids and junkies on the inner webs i hate blockbusters so much so i get like the best
6372820	6380540	schadenfreude from anything you know why blockbuster ceo four types four types of cancer i'm like
6380540	6385900	that's because you run blockbuster gave it to you wow that's vicious what what that's
6385900	6391340	really horrible i'm being hyperbole why is it that um you know not all of them are corporate
6391340	6396580	run stores by the way yeah that's can i dig into this a little more hold on why do you
6396580	6401020	have such hatred for blockbuster they used to work for them there are certain movies
6401020	6404220	you have a sixty dollar late fee still don't know there are certain movies that they just
6404220	6409220	wouldn't carry like if it was a rated r movie but it was a lgbt themed movie like boys don't
6409220	6413500	cry with hillary snake they wouldn't carry it they just had this weird sort of censorship
6413500	6417500	like family friendly stuff it's bullshit let people rent movies what they want don't yeah
6417500	6421900	is that the showgirls with the bras drawn on yeah they would that's the copy if they
6421900	6426780	had a copy of showgirls at all that's the copy they would have so netflix all the way
6426780	6432320	i don't care all right and tiger claw links us to another uh tweet uh tweet an article
6432320	6436420	that i actually think is kind of cool it's about this mouse the shogun brothers chameleon
6436420	6441780	x1 mouse it actually lives a double life as a controller so i guess it's like one of those
6441780	6446180	like transformer things where it just goes one one one one one one and it can transform
6446180	6453700	into that controller that's kind of neat 55 dollars if you want it though nice that just
6453700	6459140	makes me think that it would get really linty and cruddy because like even if you you if
6459140	6462620	you use a mouse a lot they get kind of gross so i don't know why you'd want buttons on
6462620	6467660	there not my mouse my mouse smells like kittens and rainbows it's perfect i don't know what
6467660	6473000	you're talking about and lastly a tweet from gamer girl who wants us to know la mulana
6473000	6479580	rocks just saying you go ahead girl go ahead gamer girl with your la mulana there it is
6479580	6486180	our tweets twitter.com slash o l r act deft wants us to know that uh netflix isn't in
6486180	6490980	mexico he says since netflix doesn't exist here i'm still stuck with blockbuster and
6490980	6499020	it ain't it ain't bad it ain't bad yeah yeah all right i mean are mexican blockbusters
6499020	6503280	the same as the ones here or pretty much do they still sell like the candy up front like
6503280	6507340	as much as you pay for at the movie theater when there'd be like a 7-eleven next door
6507340	6515140	to get the same thing for like a sixth as much money just curious hey let's move on
6515140	6522580	to some more stories huh let's uh so of course the npd numbers just came out for the stuff
6522580	6527780	for november and it's a very interesting month because it is the last big month for games
6527780	6534820	um for the year usually because december's just crap anyways so of course one of the
6534820	6540900	highlights of is how well did the connect do and did pretty well it actually outsold
6540900	6547620	uh the playstation move five to one in november which is pretty impressive i'd say and um
6547620	6554540	also of course uh microsoft didn't do too bad with xbox 360 systems they sold 1.37 million
6554540	6561340	units in november and they said that it puts the connect uh bundle figure range around
6561340	6571340	uh 685 000 units and uh the move console bundles around uh 130 37 000 units and it says right
6571340	6578220	now global sales the top uh 2.5 million units and sony has reported 4.1 million playstation
6578220	6582540	movie units have been shipped to retailers though the company hasn't disclosed actual
6582540	6589460	sales numbers and let me be honest here um 4.1 million and 2.5 million i don't want to
6589460	6594820	sound biased or anything but i mean you're comparing move units versus the connect connect
6594820	6600100	you need one the move you may need up to four i mean that's a little you know and are they
6600100	6607220	counting the nav controller on top of that um you know it's a little wonky those numbers
6607220	6613620	but whatever fuzzy math exactly fuzzy math that they spin to make it look like the move
6613620	6621340	is doing better than it is and honestly the move is it's nice but the moving getting spots
6621340	6628940	on ellen the move isn't appearing in you know tv shows that's a little worrisome i guess
6628940	6634620	um some of the top games of course for uh november it's not a big surprise call of duty
6634620	6639220	black ops being number one assassin's creed brotherhood number two although number three
6639220	6645980	is kind of surprising just dance two is the top um title for november uh followed by madden
6645980	6652380	11 fable 3 donkey kong country returns need for speed hot pursuit gran turismo 5 mba 2k11
6652380	6658060	and we fit plus because people still buy we fit plus and of course with the connect titles
6658060	6664140	coming out it's um no wonder i mean you're gonna guess the best-selling title for the
6664140	6669180	connect other than obviously connect adventures because that comes with the actual units but
6669180	6675980	down central it was um the number 11 title um overall in sales for the month and the
6675980	6683820	top selling connect title as a standalone skew awesome and who says uh music games are
6683820	6692060	dead i don't know who people if harmonix is up for sale though that's uh not necessarily
6692060	6699460	um a good sign but maybe this will help buy it for two dollars stop all right uh the debt
6699460	6706300	though they can keep the debt apparently uh yeah there's some i've got a story and believe
6706300	6710300	it or not guys pay attention because it involves video games it involves pornography you ready
6710300	6715700	it has to do with nintendo porn uh apparently there's a website i've never heard of this
6715700	6721560	video game porn uh it received a notice from sy valence which is a company i guess it was
6721560	6726640	hired by nintendo uh saying that this site has been committing trademark violation because
6726640	6731700	they use the name nintendo to describe an image of a scantily clad woman who holds a
6731700	6738740	nintendo ds so it's like chick with boobies out plays nintendo ds and now nintendo is
6738740	6746140	like objection you can't say nintendo video game porn.net is that really oh you're looking

6847260	6852460	i want to see the naughty oh look at oh she is definitely using a dsi to cover up her
6852460	6858260	naughty bits and like i like this because in one in one picture here she's showing okay
6858260	6863980	i'm i'm using the dsi to take a picture of my panties you see that that's one picture
6863980	6867860	and then in another she's she's using the dsi she's holding it up to her face and she's
6867860	6873300	like oh maybe i'll take an artful picture with my dsi and then the last picture she's
6873300	6881160	just fingering her pussy and there's no dsi whatsoever it's just hey i decided to put
6881160	6891860	it away guess where i put it i found a new toy my yeah my mind the jokes right now please
6891860	6897860	by all means that you're gonna ruin your stylus you have to get another one you try what's
6897860	6903720	that's why she has an xl her belly button has very awkward placement doesn't her belly
6903720	6908180	button kind of look like really left of center like doesn't that kind of like look like a
6908180	6914340	gunshot that is where the stylus is right now i don't know it's perspective rob either
6914340	6920220	that or bad photoshopping you're trying to play scribble knots and you can't draw you're
6920220	6924580	like what is wrong with this stylus it's all gross what happens if you put horror in scribble
6924580	6929700	knots does it just not know does it just go all right dark soccer you have some other
6929700	6935960	news for us unfortunately it probably won't involve boobies no but it involves amazon
6935960	6943460	so and amazon's have one boob i guess anyway um now i just it's already been going on here
6943460	6950380	but now um amazon uk is going to be paying for old games and trade-in you can uh print
6950380	6958460	up a prepaid delivery label for your box and sorry i was thinking of the last story and
6958460	6964580	for example if you send in medal of honor you'll get a 23 pound uh gift card credited
6964580	6971460	to your account that's a heavy gift card i see how's british money joke i like that okay
6971460	6978020	then i'll change it for just dance too you get 15 quid how's that for assassins creed
6978020	6985460	brotherhood 28 quid so now you can't make a joke about that well we could it probably
6985460	6990660	just wouldn't be funny but i think it's like up to three and uh if your game's broken they're
6990660	6997060	gonna send it back and uh they'll basically just send you a confirmation say you can have
6997060	7003020	the money or you can't and then they'll send it back in two weeks a faulty really faulty
7003020	7007700	stuff may be just thrown away so i guess maybe it's a free way of getting rid of shit you
7007700	7014620	might get stuff back but it's supposed to be again three a month there's an ad on that
7014620	7018780	page you're reading from this as insert coin and i can't help but thinking that's what
7018780	7023300	the girl is trying to do in the picture i was looking at the one that said in soviet
7023300	7028400	russia games make you stronger uh i i can't get off of uh boobs uh and apparently neither
7028400	7033480	can our chat room there's uh jokes about the res trans vibrator uh the ps3 controller that
7033480	7038320	vibrates uh tiger claw saying that stylus is not a suppository put that down all these
7038320	7043200	gems coming from chat that's not where you put a suppository com suppositories go in

7050860	7058700	yeah but i was saying it's not a suppository we're gonna do a math lesson for dark sakura
7058700	7069860	two plus one is fun professor latin in the case of the cantankerous clitoris i wish i'd
7069860	7075500	taken a picture of the gesture that rob made when he made his little addition thing that's
7075500	7080800	not on my algebra final solar flare in our charm says i thought nintendo already knew
7080800	7085400	about their products in porn they sell the rubbers for their wiimotes oh we condom joke
7085400	7092740	i like that you know what olr needs we need a contest vibrator best slash fiction involving
7092740	7098580	nintendo characters and it should just be as absurd as possible do you think there's
7098580	7107220	some good mario i've read absurd uh absurd fan fiction although i don't think it was
7107220	7113100	really nintendo related but it's actually i have in the past found metroid fan fiction
7113100	7118620	let's see i typed mario peach slash into google and i got this website that came up oh it's
7118620	7132880	newgrounds oh oh this is called son of a peach what's it rated is if it's m or a then automatically

7243140	7248740	why didn't nintendo send a cease and desist to that that's my question that's tasteful
7248740	7253340	because they're calling up legal and they're like they hang up the phone they're like this
7253340	7263660	is hot i'm gonna wait i'm gonna see how this ends labor is not hot no it's very disgusting
7263660	7273900	all right ramen our term says mario you are not the father all right let's move on please
7273900	7280860	quick loki we need a new story quick something that doesn't involve boobs and mario labor
7280860	7291260	okay um so apparently there's this comment going around um from ea games president frank
7291260	7298100	uh gabow he believes that the future of the game industry will come um from multiplayer
7298100	7303380	games says that we're uh ea is very comfortable moving the discussion towards how we make
7303380	7309980	connected gameplay be it cooperative or multiplayer or online services as opposed to um fire forget
7309980	7317500	packaged goods only single player 25 hours and you're out he says um i think the model
7317500	7323700	is finished yeah finished for them basically to translate this in layman's peak he believes
7323700	7330660	that games should have more of an online component which they charge money for and also more
7330660	7336140	download content later on so that it extends the gameplay beyond 25 hours which they charge
7336140	7342420	money for and um you know possibly some sort of massive multiplayer online service which
7342420	7347460	they would also change more anymore so basically he wants to charge more money for stuff well
7347460	7352820	i mean i hate to say it but isn't there kind of maybe a hint of truth to this like because
7352820	7358420	you know i think about okay well uh facebook games are a part of where gaming seems to
7358420	7362900	be going at least is the next big thing and most of that is multiplayer certainly there's
7362900	7366900	lots of money to be made in mmos heck most of the single player games that are out these
7366900	7372580	days even final fantasy 13 was there download content that ever came out on playstation
7372580	7377220	3 for it i think it was rumored but besides that the trophies and the achievements kind
7377220	7383180	of add to this more cohesive multiplayer experience on xbox live and playstation network granted
7383180	7388700	not every gamer is connected on their system and some people are quite content playing
7388700	7396500	the games by themselves but even people that don't know how to get their um xboxes online
7396500	7402500	and stuff have probably at least played bejeweled blitz once in their life right yeah i just
7402500	7406140	think that i've never played it you know this is kind of an excuse to say oh well we don't
7406140	7409780	need to worry too much about the single player experience because people are just gonna play
7409780	7413740	the multiplayer experience and you haven't played bejeweled blitz but you played knights
7413740	7420460	of the clicky it's even worse yeah which by the way i know i'm a little early but f you
7420460	7424420	to knights of the clicky because it just deleted like three of my friends the other day just
7424420	7429500	like oh really like two of them are friends of mine i talk to every day did you send had
7429500	7433340	to send a re-invite or something i didn't try that yet i was hoping it would fix itself
7433340	7436980	it will if they do you know if they removed the game like deleted the game from their
7436980	7441060	own profile like they've had enough they're getting intervention maybe i don't know one
7441060	7445380	of them was xlink so xlink did you delete the game what'd you do i don't know yeah he's
7445380	7449220	still on mine so that shouldn't happen no see i think he probably just deleted me from
7449220	7453740	his friends list he's like i'm sick of all these vlogs and uh keyboard cat videos i'm
7453740	7455860	just deleting rob for my friends list that's probably what really happened
7455860	7462940	anyhow now we'll get a phone call later for sure oh rob we still love you all right you
7462940	7468780	better uh here's another uh speaking of multiplayer places where multiplayer things are happening
7468780	7473860	you know this is the future low-key playstation home i mean surely this is what the guy from
7473860	7478060	ea was talking about right was playstation home was where the multiplayer is at can you
7478060	7481740	believe playstation home has been out for two years that's right a sony press release
7481740	7486660	came out this week celebrating the second birthday of playstation home over 17 million
7486660	7492200	users have visited home uh for two minutes and then they and then they left right they
7492200	7497780	have participated in over 600 community events so what that means obviously is collectively
7497780	7505400	those 17 million users played 600 community events um let's see uh some of them were sponsored
7505400	7509580	by game developers and so on some of them were more unofficial sodium 2 is coming out
7509580	7517840	next spring oh goody and conspiracy a multiplayer spy puzzle game from jet set games is coming
7517840	7524580	out as well i just want to know when the furry sex lounge is coming out because that's let's
7524580	7530180	just call it what it is i mean why are we wasting our time hello by the way i tried
7530180	7537380	to do the ddr thing couldn't do it home is the future now it's time for some of you to
7537380	7542880	visit our our home not literally uh we want you to send us emails and interact with us
7542880	7547260	mailbag at orange lounge radio.com is the place for you to send us emails dark sakura
7547260	7550740	dives into the email bag every week and read some emails this is a great way to interact
7550740	7555420	with us if you don't listen or can't listen live every sunday night we always love emails
7555420	7564500	mailbag at orange lounge radio.com this was the email that was uh um referred to earlier
7564500	7571100	hey sky and dark sakura sorry loki i don't know if you're able to purchase the wild games
7571100	7575340	at the moment at this at the awesome sale prices yet i didn't see any sale prices by
7575340	7581140	the way i think it's done it'll be back it'll be back but here is an alternative it sounds
7581140	7585720	like jamie had a wow account in the past so if rob sends her skull of resurrection via
7585720	7591020	blizzard's website then he gets a free month when a month of paid game time is applied
7591020	7595860	to jamie's account including a 10-day non-restricted free trial rob can simply buy jamie a month
7595860	7600820	of a game as a present no games or expansions will have to be purchased and play for 40
7600820	7605660	days and try out the new old world content just an idea from horde house podcast number
7605660	7612760	one fan flaco jones flaco jones but that's okay uh yeah i think it's a great idea i can't
7612760	7615500	believe i didn't even think of the scroll of resurrection but that's a great idea the
7615500	7620860	thing is i when was the last time it played if it was more than two months ago i think
7620860	7624940	you're eligible okay which i mean you you're more than six months out aren't you no i think
7624940	7629540	i'm actually a year out because i got star trek online didn't i get it last christmas
7629540	7634500	i don't know no i didn't i got it so yeah i think star trek online came out like february
7634500	7638420	i think the beta test is going on yeah yeah yeah so i've been playing star trek online
7638420	7642280	since it was in beta that was star trek online was in beta around the time you and i started
7642280	7649060	dating right yeah so i think it was last christmas so yeah so i so i've been and i quit world
7649060	7653260	of warcraft to play star trek online uh yeah i could get you like a 60-day card and then
7653260	7656620	you'd have your two months right there and yeah it'll be like a little present and then
7656620	7661900	i get a free month out of it so hi and that means that i don't have to actually quit and
7661900	7664820	you can still experience the new content you'll be able to play you said you had through burning
7664820	7669540	crusade you'll be burning crusades the only thing you can't do is play a worgen so you
7669540	7672740	won't and to be honest i'm not i don't really give a shit about worgen so you'll be able
7672740	7676100	to play to level 70 which is a long time i'm gonna play a goat chick again draenei are
7676100	7679900	awesome the draenei were cool they're really cool i think they're they are probably the
7679900	7684860	most underrated class in wow next it was my favorite yeah except that you know my whole
7684860	7690020	okay here's what the problem i ran into was when i hit level 20 i was like what the fuck
7690020	7697260	do i do now i'm on i'm off the island i'm on this place on a boat i'm on a boat in fact
7697260	7701240	i think i remember actually standing out and shouting i'm on a boat but i don't know what
7701240	7706740	to do now i don't know where anyone is i don't know what anyone's doing and the only issue
7706740	7711860	you would have is that the draenei and the blood elf starting areas were the only areas
7711860	7716660	that weren't changed with this new expansion so it's still on the same quests and everything
7716660	7721920	but i have a level 20 draenei already oh i guess that's true what she would still definitely
7721920	7727340	benefit from is the new hero bulletin board in any capital city there's a bulletin board
7727340	7730920	where you right click it and it says and it'll look at what level you are and it's like we
7730920	7735980	could really use your help in redridge mountains because you're level 25 and it's like oh and
7735980	7740380	then it'll give you a breadcrumb quest to go talk to someone in x own that's that's
7740380	7743700	new and that's awesome i kind of dig that i mean this is one of the things that i like
7743700	7749060	to i really really like about star trek online is that first of all i can play i've completely
7749060	7753100	except for like playing a few things with some of my fleet friends i've done all of
7753100	7759400	my leveling myself i've done all my missions myself and i like the missions because it's
7759400	7765940	like okay well you do this oh no this leads to this thing and it's all in the same area
7765940	7770460	you know like one of my favorite my favorite mission that i've done to date is the uh the
7770460	7777380	one that i said was like silent hill where it's the stupid most stupid uh next generation
7777380	7782100	uh bad guys was the davidians the ones that were the psychic leeches that were just slightly
7782100	7787300	out of phase with reality these blue glowing creatures and they figured a way back in you
7787300	7790260	have to go in the past you have to go in the present but when but they've screwed up the
7790260	7795860	electronics in this old station to where this hologram that's trapped there is psycho and
7795860	7799940	trying to kill you and it's like calling out creepy stuff it's very silent hill and all
7799940	7804140	you have is your flashlight and everything and you know that was my favorite but you
7804140	7809020	know you get to this one point and then you hear the voice and and another thing happens
7809020	7811660	and that's why i like this something that builds and builds and builds on top of each
7811660	7815460	other which is what i wasn't really getting out of world of warcraft before well it's
7815460	7821100	settled i'm gonna get dark soccer a 60-day wow card as a chris mccay gift and uh then
7821100	7824100	it's a win-win situation because i won't have to hear as much star trek nerd chat on this
7824100	7831740	show hearts but i was using it as a basis of comparison i give you shit because that's
7831740	7835820	what i've been doing for the past nine years i know but but my point is is that that's
7835820	7839060	the type of missions i like and if there's stuff like that now in world of warcraft because
7839060	7843980	honestly there really wasn't there was it was like okay will you take your deer and
7843980	7849780	skin their corpses yeah that was really it i'm like but only one in every six deer has
7849780	7856720	a skin apparently yeah which they they fix that yeah whereas if i have a scanning mission
7856720	7862920	it's beam to the planet scan five of these items you're done and you run up to the items
7862920	7869660	and you just scan them and that's it and i call those my free xp ones that oh look at
7869660	7874980	the pretty textures you know things rama is starting the you sold out chance uh tiger
7874980	7880700	claw says it's an excuse to get dark soccer on horde house and uh death wishing says crack
7880700	7887020	rob's buying soccer a crack to get a free hit a crack and again keep in mind there's
7887020	7894680	no guarantee i'll stick with it again because i am on star trek online i'm in a fleet i
7894680	7899160	play with scottish men who i love playing with my scottish dudes yes but if you come
7899160	7905100	to wow you can be in a guild full of gay men oh that is fantastic i don't know what what
7905100	7911080	wins scottish are gay now if i had scottish gay i would mcgregor well he's not gay but
7911080	7918540	he's there to dream that would be hot i i've my brain i went to my status screen my internal

8156780	8165060	shallow so pardon me for being completely shallow but um and again i don't want to say
8165060	8169460	i do this because it's one of my friends i thought it was a really sweet gesture but

8198820	8201300	out story i'm not going to go into it and i completely misunderstood what my friend
8201300	8207640	said okay one of my friends on facebook was feeling angry because someone verbally belittled
8207640	8210920	her for what she was wearing to an event and she said she was thinking well at least i
8210920	8218260	have children and you don't now i thought it was because you know i've been trying i
8218260	8222620	thought it was okay is that all the value a woman has what the hell kind of response
8222620	8227620	is that too like i have children and you don't like she went back and explained it to me
8227620	8232700	that it's i have to pay for my children you don't have to pay for your for any children
8232700	8238860	i have expenses that you don't i have responsibilities that you don't that's what she meant i didn't
8238860	8248140	see it that way because i've been a little bitter um damn you uris um but uh one of her
8248140	8253580	friends has like started going in three all caps locked posts by the way about i've adopted
8253580	8258000	all these children and i've had the court waive my costs and everything and i was like
8258000	8262320	dude like don't what are you doing adopting children if you can't freaking afford them
8262320	8267100	that's almost as bad i mean i i guess you're trying to do something good but you know and
8267100	8273580	my response to her was i don't care you're not my friend this the person who made the
8273580	8278820	first post she's my friend you are not this isn't about you and so when i went to check
8278820	8283660	on it an hour later all of those posts were deleted facebook serious business but i'm
8283660	8290100	saying i'm saying it's just like that's that's leading up to this fu nobody needs to know
8290100	8297540	your personal shit we don't care if you're not our friend we don't care saying all this
8297540	8302740	stuff to make yourself be all holier than thou just makes you look bitchier than thou

8326180	8333060	out front to my house that's the one that's messed up so i don't have internet for that
8333060	8338100	much uh longer thankfully though i have hacked my phone to be able to wi-fi tether to it
8338100	8344620	so i have i've had slow internet but uh i'd rather have fast internet i also bought a
8344620	8351740	docsis 3 modem now so it should be even faster when i do get it working that's it um i don't
8351740	8358300	have a whole lot actually my fus are um pretty you know just just fu to um not having enough
8358300	8361780	money to take any extravagant holiday trips because i'm gonna have an entire week off
8361780	8367700	of work this year just due to situations and and you know uh just me having extra pto in
8367700	8371380	them encouraging me to take it basically uh so i'm gonna have a whole week off and nowhere
8371380	8375700	to go so f you that fact i mean there might be other things going on that will definitely
8375700	8382420	take my time but uh fu to getting old and not having trips to take slices pop do you
8382420	8390020	have any fus fus to buying something digitally and then not having it post to your banking
8390020	8395060	until like seven days later and kind of scurrying up the mental math of how much money you thought
8395060	8399900	you had when you're on employment on a fixed budget and you expect something that you buy
8399900	8408380	to just show up the next day and um also a fu to just playing a new type of social game

8429220	8436460	all right f you to the winner i don't know if winter can be okay sometimes but yeah i
8436460	8442060	don't like i don't i don't like the changes my body goes through either all right loki
8442060	8445500	and myself have one more story apiece for you guys then we're gonna get to the skype
8445500	8451540	line at 1877 game olr but first a couple quick stories for you guys uh what we were alluding
8451540	8457300	to earlier when we were talking to bobby and also uh i think we may have made this joke
8457300	8463820	during the show uh apparently a cyprus hill backup singer is suing rock star take two
8463820	8473900	over grand theft auto san andreas yes that's right um apparently um back in the day i guess
8473900	8481580	michael shag washington um he i guess spoke with the developer and stuff um about his
8481580	8489060	troubled youth it says um he claims that he met with rockstar 2003 to talk to them about
8489060	8494020	his street life for their upcoming game including the description of his troubled youth and
8494020	8502140	specifics of how the teenager teenagers in his gang rode around on bicycles um apparently
8502140	8509020	he's saying um you know he didn't even know that i guess he's never seen san andreas in
8509020	8513880	action until july when his nephew is playing it this is the plaintiff had never seen the
8513880	8521040	game or had never seen the game he did not um own or play video games uh the complaint
8521040	8526660	admits of further explaining upon examination of the images of cj in comparison with his
8526660	8531020	photo from that year and other evidence became clear that rockstar had stolen his image and
8531020	8537380	never paid him so now he's claiming um he was asking for 25 of the profits from san
8537380	8544620	andreas which were approximately 20 or 250 million dollars so you know 75 million dollars
8544620	8548900	of that i guess and take two of course is saying that the case is completely without
8548900	8555460	merit now part of me goes like crazy guy is very crazy and i think we can all agree this
8555460	8560780	can't be based on his real life if this was his real life having sex with hookers and
8560780	8564860	then shooting him in the face i mean he'd be in je he'd be dead from the state that
8564860	8569460	they would have executed him years ago you know i'm sorry but he wasn't the only person
8569460	8575940	i'm sure that was in a gang that rode around on a bicycle i mean come on but and i don't
8575940	8581180	think you know and i like how he says oh well the character looked like me well the character
8581180	8584900	can look like whatever you want because you can customize your character in the game is
8584900	8589500	here here's the other interesting thing is that i mean he claims that you know he filed
8589500	8595760	the lawsuit and so he must this this meeting he had with rockstar must not be fake like
8595760	8599420	that must have actually happened right because otherwise he'd be really stupid to file a
8599420	8603860	lawsuit and that can easily be disproved that rockstar never met with him but i wonder like
8603860	8609140	maybe rockstar met with a bunch of people and this is just like it's called doing research
8609140	8615300	yeah you know you do research surely he should have signed something way back then during
8615300	8620300	that initial meeting that was like you know this is just for informative purposes and
8620300	8626060	you you're not compensated beyond maybe xyz or your song being in the game or a special
8626060	8630900	thank you credit or something like that it's just yeah pretty much this seems kind of excessive
8630900	8635980	it does and it's also like too too late isn't there like a statute of limitations i guess
8635980	8641300	not but probably not tiger claw in our chat room says if the game is based on his life
8641300	8644940	then so is the hot coffee if you know what i mean i don't think it's based on his life
8644940	8649900	at all i mean it doesn't sound like this meeting was in great detail it's fiction it was based
8649900	8658440	on no one's life it's like it's like when a person is going to play a wrestler in a
8658440	8663800	movie so that person hangs out with other wrestlers to kind of know what a wrestler's
8663800	8670760	life is like that doesn't mean that you model your character directly after somebody right
8670760	8675720	don't they do this shit don't actors do this shit all the time with movies right method
8675720	8680760	acting that's yeah i wouldn't think it's that much different anyhow one more story for you
8680760	8686680	guys and it has to do with something we reported on previously an 8-bit remake of dj hero that
8686680	8692220	was out there on the internet it has been taken down from the official website why because
8692220	8696460	of a cease and desist letter from universal music publishing group there was a little
8696460	8702600	bit of back and forth going between the creator eric ruth and the universal music publishing
8702600	8707000	group and you can read the whole exchange over at what picky picky mall dot com blog
8707000	8712400	dot it's picky geek whatever this is and the whole little exchange really strikes me as
8712400	8718160	like kind of unprofessional and i don't see any signatures in it and so it's i don't know
8718160	8724040	like i read this and i go part of it reads like fanfic to me but whatever um for whatever
8724040	8728800	reason the game is now gone i mean but you know what they say once it hits the internet
8728800	8732920	it's always on the internet so it's not like you can't can't find this thing on torrent
8732920	8737240	sites and so forth and honestly the news about it getting taken down probably just makes
8737240	8741940	more people want to download it because ha i have the file i'm not supposed to have it's
8741940	8746880	just it's just like why wikileaks is such a big deal but not to get on another tangent
8746880	8750600	but people just like to have shit they're not supposed to have that's what it is it's
8750600	8756680	e-peen anyhow another interesting twist in the story and dark tetsuya had mentioned this
8756680	8763400	in our mod forum and uh sure enough it's either a heck of a coincidence uh eric ruth is the
8763400	8770240	real name of an artist that used to do bimani related things named dj potato with an e and
8770240	8774640	i can't remember if we ever had him on this show i don't think we did but i remember we
8774640	8780280	banned one of his songs from the old station because it was so so terrible and you'll just
8780280	8783160	have to google it if you want to find out about that but it's kind of funny that now
8783160	8788680	and i where are they now bimani people five years later that's the same eric ruth though
8788680	8794300	i know i'm thinking it's kind of a common name but then i go well games but i don't
8794300	8800140	know does dark tetsuya did dark tetsuya have something else to to show that or is that
8800140	8805800	just a coinky dink do i need to email dj potato and be all like is this you is this you bra
8805800	8810400	is this you we'll see so i'll have to see if there's anything else that comes out on
8810400	8815640	that but otherwise uh kind of interesting where are they now bimani people oh loki dark
8815640	8820920	sakura and sky are still doing that little podcast they started years ago and we had
8820920	8824720	iguana girl on here a few weeks ago i know we've been talking about episode 400 we're
8824720	8828680	gonna get a whole lot of the uh old people together that would be fun by the way that's
8828680	8837520	only seven weeks away we might want to start planning that all right that's it for the
8837520	8844000	news we're done let's go to the skype line 1877 game olr or our username on skype is
8844000	8850720	orange lounge radio all one word uh 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge
8850720	8857940	radio the skype line is now open for business and dark tetsuya says dark tetsuya says it
8857940	8863640	was in the read me it says dj potato with an e in the read me file so it is the same
8863640	8871160	guy yeah all right that's proof enough to me interesting all right maybe we should like
8871160	8874840	get him on the show i don't know but then i'm worried the topic of like old songs will
8874840	8880880	come up and then it'll get really awkward all right solar flare we're not doing a marathon
8880880	8885600	for episode 400 dream on all right 1877 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge
8885600	8889120	radio we have a call coming in right now hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this
8889120	8893440	is x link hi x link what's on your mind buddy you should know me i'm your friend from facebook
8893440	8898960	that didn't befriend you i well apparently you somehow have left my circle of knights
8898960	8903700	of the clicky friends so i don't know what happened it's probably because i've been inactive
8903700	8908000	because of a certain other clicky game that we're all too familiar with because we're
8908000	8914480	also all in another guild called wow i see so when wow when kata came out i kind of like
8914480	8918800	totally abandoned all my facebook games for a while so but i'm pretty sure i have people
8918800	8923700	on my facebook who haven't played that game but the first time they ever played it like
8923700	8928400	did marissa ever play past one day i doubt she did i don't know i don't know if she's
8928400	8932040	listening you have to tell me marissa if you ever kept up nights of the clicky well for
8932040	8936520	whatever reason i just thought maybe you didn't want to be my friend anymore on nights of
8936520	8941440	the clicky but maybe you just didn't want to click on my chest anymore to help me store
8941440	8947760	more gold and no no no i do i seriously do is just there's a lot going on and i really
8947760	8954440	prefer us getting all the little guilds perks and stuff so we can get our 50 or 60 bonuses
8954440	8958160	when we start killing stuff then you know play nights of the clicky and getting you
8958160	8963480	a broadsword all right so i have to ask how's warcraft cataclysm going for you since it
8963480	8968200	was the big game released this week well it's going good since it got me addicted to it
8968200	8973840	um it was fine i i went out and i ran to the you know i was one i always wanted to be in
8973840	8978040	one of those lines during the midnight launching of something so i decided to go see how it
8978040	8984160	was it was very interesting um and it was very intriguing to see the all the people
8984160	8989200	qqing and cussing i can't get in what the fuck and you know and well what the hell's
8989200	8994440	going on and it was just funny hearing the people bitch and moan for like the first like
8994440	8998480	four or five hours of trying to get into the game and they can't get in and try and become
8998480	9003840	the first of different it was over in like 10 minutes we ran black rock caverns before
9003840	9010860	1am but we were prepared to go you know i mean there was a group of like five of us
9010860	9013880	that we had emailed earlier in the day and it was like okay we're gonna be outside the
9013880	9019920	understood the dungeon at 11 59 p.m and then you're you're the one who you're the one on
9019920	9023760	your other podcast that went off and saying talking about how i told you guys that you
9023760	9027120	had to log out and you guys you didn't really believe me at first and i'm like yeah there
9027120	9031280	was a blue post that's specifically stated if you're in game by time that thing rolled
9031280	9037160	around that you have to uh actually log out and then re-log back in i i you're right i
9037160	9040160	didn't believe you it's not because i don't like you it's just one of those things where
9040160	9044420	i thought like i thought that blizzard had set this whole thing up so it was supposed
9044420	9049560	to be a seamless transition i thought it was going to be like magic i didn't think the
9049560	9052120	servers were going to boot us or anything so it just seemed really weird to me that
9052120	9056000	all of a sudden it was like now you gotta reboot and it didn't say anything like it's
9056000	9064000	like it's the cable company yeah well so anyway yeah but it whatever i mean yeah it was 10
9064000	9068000	minutes of nerd rage but then it was over and we were doing our quest it was fine but
9068000	9073000	then you guys were doing your dungeons while i'm doing the uh the uh the new profession
9073000	9078900	so how is archaeology that's something i haven't touched yet is a loads of fun but it's very
9078900	9083960	tedious and time consuming it'd be it's because you jump from place to place to place and
9083960	9088360	they're all random so you could go halfway to the bottom of the continent and then have
9088360	9094040	to fly all the way up to the top for another big site so it can take a little bit but um
9094040	9099200	there's supposedly there's going to be mounts and other items and pets i got like two pets
9099200	9105400	so far i didn't get any amounts as of yet um but uh there's like little uh uh trinkets
9105400	9111800	that does like um uh one was like it would like show the the dwarves dancing which which
9111800	9117880	our guild got the scene so um it there's a lot of odds and ends to it it's it's very
9117880	9121520	perfect they're supposed to add stuff to it which i would wait to see him and suppose
9121520	9126160	to add some war to the game so it'll be very interesting to see how that transaction plays
9126160	9129520	out all right we'll see what happens anything else you want to share with listeners tonight
9129520	9136080	xlink um no that i'm one of the few people in your guild that's not gay but that's okay
9136080	9139720	but you know i still love you anyways you can you can still fake a scottish accent pretty
9139720	9146480	good right no i cannot all right you're not even gonna try no not at all you're no fun
9146480	9152280	at all just so you know i'm sorry all right you i just can't do a scottish accent that's

9223000	9230120	who's this death wishing death wish hey what's on your mind death wishing besides being really
9230120	9235120	tired because i rode 60 miles on my bike uh wait why'd you ride 16 miles on your bike
9235120	9241160	because i'm working out i want to have big huge quads i see oh you got to impress the
9241160	9246880	ladies uh yes with my massive meaty legs yeah sure whatever i see you gotta have beefcake
9246880	9252240	legs all right that's fine all right well good luck with the bike riding well what's
9252240	9257840	on your mind tonight what the hell is up with this grand prison like i'm was at my friend's
9257840	9264280	house i'm playing it and i realized 200 cars is ungodly beautiful you can take pictures
9264280	9269560	of them it's almost like that's all the games good for is taking pictures of cars and like
9269560	9273720	wanking but i know it's like i'm going through 200 cars lists and like wow these are beautiful
9273720	9278320	all of a sudden i get to one car and it looks like playstation one it's like they made this
9278320	9285680	great game and so the game is like a burger and then the bacon that's supposed to be wrapped
9285680	9292640	around it is like three weeks old interesting analogy um do you think maybe possibly i know
9292640	9297800	i know this might be hard to believe but do you think maybe a game company rushed the
9297800	9302680	game to get it out at a certain time i mean i know we like didn't just have a story on
9302680	9309440	that earlier in the evening but do you think maybe they rushed this car and just made it
9309440	9314240	out of you know triangles and basic shapes to get it in there i think they just got fed
9314240	9318480	up with all these like oh you have to push it back oh we got to push it back we uh messed
9318480	9323080	up on a tire thing our developer he's a neat freak and he keeps on trying to make the cars
9323080	9325880	look beautiful then soon they're just like fuck it we'll make it so you can drive a go
9325880	9329820	kart and backwards and win a race you know what would be awesome is that if gran turismo
9329820	9333920	had like more of a sense of humor and they put some funny cars in the game like uh for
9333920	9337840	instance like how about an old covered wagon with oxen could actually be one of the cars
9337840	9342320	like you have a you have a river that you're trying to uh ford to get across that could
9342320	9346880	be like an awesome car that was like one of those like little like barbie jeeps yes a
9346880	9351240	barbie jeep or a flintstone car where the guys are running to get it i remember one
9351240	9355240	of the old need for speed games had a bunch of different codes you could put into races
9355240	9358800	different things and then one of the things that they had like a lot of them were background
9358800	9364760	objects like you could race as a log you could race as a t-rex statue we used to have log
9364760	9370360	races all the time it was awesome or a log with the t-rex chasing after you and like
9370360	9375480	like meter made cars and all sorts of crazy shit or where you can race as the horse and
9375480	9379280	daytona wait i have a question when you would do the log races would you actually all sing

9670120	9674560	time caller right no i called before oh i guess it was just i called about the pinball
9674560	9679920	thing oh yes that's right i remember that i do remember that okay i'm just all right
9679920	9687160	so dumb the reason why i called was i recently bought um my boyfriend um a commodore 64 for
9687160	9692200	christmas you are like the best girlfriend ever that is we both of us have never had
9692200	9700880	one uh-huh so and he's like really into like old uh um stuff like that and uh i just wanted
9700880	9706200	to ask you guys what kind of game should i get because i really don't know okay like
9706200	9711240	every great arc no that's why every great 80s arcade game was had a version on the commodore
9711240	9716020	64 it's like anything you can think of even if it was like nintendo or sega like uh donkey
9716020	9722120	kong had a version uh on commodore 64 if you can find uh this game it was uh an awesome
9722120	9726840	commodore 64 game called the great giana sisters it was like a mario brothers ripoff and it
9726840	9730880	was so bad they actually had to take it off store shelves but you could probably find
9730880	9735140	it like on websites you know of shadier means and burn them to a five a five and a quarter
9735140	9740440	floppy these days uh great giana sisters is awesome okay how are you gonna put in a floppy
9740440	9748720	when there's no floppy drives actually i found floppy disks i found i'm gonna go to the best
9748720	9754240	one hey do you got five and a quarter floppy disks i could buy will you please let me finish
9754240	9763960	sorry thrift stores aha smart lady shops yeah or uh auctions like if there's like flea markets
9763960	9769160	and auctions a lot of times you can find old stuff there uh you might even be i don't know
9769160	9774120	if you would actually find commodore 64 games those are really hard to find now however
9774120	9778440	never do business on ebay with trader dan because he will rip you the fuck off keep
9778440	9782600	in mind there's still making with that there's still a lot of commodore 64 community out
9782600	9787640	there uh you might even be able to find like a cartridge that has like a usb thing in the
9787640	9791440	back like i don't even know like how these things there's got to be ways that you can
9791440	9795480	get because i know there's a huge modding community out there uh so yeah i guess loki
9795480	9798760	makes a good point as far as like actually getting the game on a five and a quarter floppy
9798760	9803440	might be kind of difficult now but i know it i know with the extensive community it's
9803440	9807120	out there there's got to be something there's got to be uh the last ninja by the way is
9807120	9812800	also a great game also what was that the last ninja okay also another awesome game is delta
9812800	9818920	patrol it's got a really awesome soundtrack it's like 20 minutes plus uh any game that
9818920	9825780	was by a company called epics epyx was pretty epic uh they made games like jumpman jr which
9825780	9830600	was awesome and summer olympics and winter olympics they were like some of the best games
9830600	9836580	was by epics so you gotta check that out and honestly just do just do some google searches
9836580	9842780	like do like best commodore 64 roms and even though you'll get to like some shady websites
9842780	9846600	they'll have some pretty good suggestions you know there's a huge retro community for
9846600	9851200	the commodore 64 out there and you'll find some stuff you like so all right that sounds

9856120	9859960	like dating you but just the fact that you bought your boyfriend a commodore 64 is a
