00:00.000 --> 00:19.960
Tonight, December 19th, 2010, Cataclysm sells Oodles Noodles, the crime victim calls for

00:19.960 --> 00:29.960
the ban of Mafia 2, and Kinect's first sex game gets the smackdown from Microsoft.

00:29.960 --> 00:35.440
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:35.440 --> 00:44.280
Lounge Radio, December 19th, 2010, episode 394. It's the show where every gamer has a

00:44.280 --> 00:50.600
voice. Join us live in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com. My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be with you

00:50.600 --> 00:55.040
over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.040
Yo.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.040
How you doing?

00:57.040 --> 01:00.680
I'm doing well and energized and electrified.

01:00.680 --> 01:05.480
You're energized. Electrified, gosh, you sound, I don't know, like you've just been to Xanadu

01:05.480 --> 01:06.480
or something, I don't know.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.160
No, I saw Tron twice this week.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.480
Oh, wasn't Tron amazing?

01:09.480 --> 01:10.480
I know.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.560
Okay, I'll get into that in a minute, though, but I have to introduce, of course, the one

01:14.560 --> 01:16.160
and only tech master, Loki!

01:16.160 --> 01:17.160
Hi.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.160
How are you doing, Loki?

01:19.160 --> 01:20.160
Fine.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.720
You know, I remember a time when you really hated all things Apple, and now it's funny

01:23.720 --> 01:27.120
because at the start of the show, I'm always having to tear you away from that new little

01:27.120 --> 01:30.000
eye touch you have, or you've had for a couple months now.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.680
No, you see, I hate all things Mac, not Apple.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.080
Oh, my bad.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.280
Apple 2 was a pretty awesome computer back in the day.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.000
It's true, it's what we all played Oregon Trail.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.760
But I'm sorry, all those Mac computers are way too damn overpriced.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.500
Making friends, and we're not even five minutes into the show. It's just the three of us here

01:49.500 --> 01:53.400
in studio tonight, sadly no guests joining us, but it is our last show of the year, if

01:53.400 --> 01:54.400
you can believe it.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.780
We're not going to be here because of the holiday next week, sadly, sorry, but some

01:58.780 --> 02:02.000
of us are going out of town, so we're not going to be able to get everybody together

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
to do the show next week.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.040
So it's our last show of 2010, ah!

02:06.040 --> 02:10.240
So don't worry, guys, we'll be back, of course, in two weeks, and we have plenty of show to

02:10.240 --> 02:11.760
go to tonight.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.720
So we always like to start things off with how is your gaming week, but can I just say

02:15.720 --> 02:19.640
OMG Tron, like, wasn't it great?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.320
I know!

02:21.320 --> 02:24.200
So you had to go see it, what, Tuesday? How'd you swing that?

02:24.200 --> 02:27.560
Well, um, Jessica Harper had an extra ticket.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.480
Yeah, and she was on the show a few weeks ago, right?

02:29.480 --> 02:32.720
Yes, and, uh, she, uh, let me have it.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.720
And so we all went.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
Nice.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.720
And what'd you think?

02:35.720 --> 02:36.720
Ugh!

02:36.720 --> 02:37.720
Oomph!

02:37.720 --> 02:41.740
What was the best part, well, without spoiling, because keep in mind there's a lot of people

02:41.740 --> 02:45.040
that are like, OMG, you don't want spoilers, so is there a way you can kind of say the

02:45.040 --> 02:50.340
best part of the new Tron movie without ruining everything, anything?

02:50.340 --> 02:55.680
Not really, because I like how everything flowed together, but I'd have to say I have

02:55.680 --> 03:00.600
a favorite line, as we've discussed earlier, but I'll go ahead and repeat it.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.000
The cycles haven't been good, have they?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.440
You don't look that bad.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.440
Very nice, very nice.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.440
Yeah.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.880
Loki, you got to see the Trons as well?

03:08.880 --> 03:09.880
Yes, I did.

03:09.880 --> 03:10.880
How was Tron for you?

03:10.880 --> 03:11.880
It was awesome.

03:11.880 --> 03:12.880
Yeah?

03:12.880 --> 03:17.480
It was just everything I was hoping it would be, so I would definitely see it again.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.280
And everybody here saw it in 3D, right?

03:19.280 --> 03:20.280
Yeah.

03:20.280 --> 03:26.320
Honestly, this is a movie that it is totally beneficial to see it in 3D, because, I'll

03:26.320 --> 03:28.720
just say, Wizard of Oz treatment.

03:28.720 --> 03:33.880
Yes, it's not all in 3D, but it's very interesting.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.240
And yeah, I would just say my favorite part was how they upgraded some things from the

03:38.240 --> 03:43.200
old movie, like I, how can I say this without spoiling too much, but okay, y'all know there's

03:43.200 --> 03:45.600
going to be a light cycle sequence in it, right?

03:45.600 --> 03:49.840
And when they did the whole light cycles, but some of the new stuff they did with it,

03:49.840 --> 03:54.000
like in, like I'm doing hand motions here in studio, like I was just like, oh that is

03:54.000 --> 03:57.080
something that isn't spoiled by the trailers or the commercials.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.780
I know, but I'm trying to be good.

03:59.780 --> 04:04.040
If you actually go look on the Tron Wiki, they do explain that they're all different

04:04.040 --> 04:05.040
models.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.200
Here's the interesting though, just kind of tie it back to what we're all about here at

04:07.200 --> 04:08.200
OLR.

04:08.200 --> 04:14.000
It made me want to play the game like really bad, and the game has not been kindly treated

04:14.000 --> 04:16.320
by the critics out there.

04:16.320 --> 04:22.960
It's been getting like average reviews, and when I say average, I mean like a six, which

04:22.960 --> 04:23.960
I don't know.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.080
Usually when a game gets a six, that means it's really bad.

04:27.080 --> 04:31.320
But of course, the movie is only getting like a 40% or something on Rotten Tomatoes.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.960
This is not a movie for critics.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.880
It's not going to win Oscars.

04:34.880 --> 04:39.640
The dialogue and story are all nerd service, but I honestly think like I walked out of

04:39.640 --> 04:42.500
that theater, I was just like mind blown.

04:42.500 --> 04:49.160
This is a movie worthy of like Star Wars, Star Trek nerd opus, you know.

04:49.160 --> 04:55.920
And on top of that, if you have seen the first movie several times and know it very well,

04:55.920 --> 05:02.120
and if you've kept up with some of the roundabout stuff, even some of the old deleted scenes,

05:02.120 --> 05:04.440
there is a lot in this that makes sense.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.280
And you know, I actually went back and was listening to the soundtrack a bit, because

05:07.280 --> 05:12.560
keep in mind, I have like the original soundtrack for the original Tron.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.400
Oh, but the new soundtrack.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.720
When I went back and gave it a solid listen, some of the elements, especially for character

05:18.720 --> 05:24.000
theme songs, were incorporated from the original into the new.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.200
I just have to say Daft Punk did an astounding job.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.840
And I realized like when people listen to the soundtrack the first time, they're like,

05:31.840 --> 05:33.760
this isn't like a Daft Punk album.

05:33.760 --> 05:40.320
But like the music was like a good, like 80% of the reason why the movie kicked ass so

05:40.320 --> 05:41.320
much.

05:41.320 --> 05:45.000
Honestly, even though I say it's not like an Oscar caliber movie, this movie ought to

05:45.000 --> 05:47.360
be getting nominated for at least some of the technical effects.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.560
And seriously, I am not lying.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.920
And I'm not being a fanboy.

05:50.920 --> 05:55.680
It would be a crime if Daft Punk didn't get nominated for the score, because it adds that

05:55.680 --> 05:57.160
much to the movie.

05:57.160 --> 06:02.760
Like we don't need some artsy fartsy film, stealing one of the nominations for score,

06:02.760 --> 06:05.560
you know, that's kind of like the same old, same old that you always hear in a period

06:05.560 --> 06:06.600
piece.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.120
This is something like really new and different.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.120
I really hope it gets acknowledged.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.300
I'm going to spoil one thing.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.600
There's nothing after the credits.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.600
Oh yeah.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.600
Okay.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.600
That's not much of a spoiler.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.600
Yeah.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.920
But you know what else I really like too is how they gave the Disney castle the Tron treatment.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.920
Oh, it's awesome.

06:20.920 --> 06:21.920
That's so cool.

06:21.920 --> 06:25.880
I really want to go see the Disney electronica thing, which I still haven't seen.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.700
I have friends there right now.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.800
We were supposed to go this weekend, but it just didn't work out.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.800
I'm glad we didn't.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.800
You know why?

06:31.800 --> 06:32.800
It was a cold damn weekend.

06:32.800 --> 06:33.800
It got rained.

06:33.800 --> 06:34.800
They shut most of it down.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.280
But, uh, yeah, I had friends that went down there and they still had a good time, so I'm

06:39.280 --> 06:40.280
glad to hear it.

06:40.280 --> 06:44.320
I'm, I'm bummed I didn't go, but at the same time, I had a great time at the movie.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.640
Just awesome time.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.200
I went and saw it at the Metreon.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.560
Remember the Metreon?

06:48.560 --> 06:50.120
Oh, the poor, poor Metreon.

06:50.120 --> 06:54.200
Or now that the lights are burned out, it's the Me-re-on.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.600
So I went to the Me-re-on to see the movie.

06:55.600 --> 07:00.000
And if you don't know what the Me-re-on is, it's a building in San Francisco and it used

07:00.000 --> 07:02.280
to house the official PlayStation Store.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.920
And so you'd see a lot of events would be happening at the Me-re-on, uh, where they

07:05.920 --> 07:07.800
would have like a line going out and everything.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.520
Well, the Sony store is gone.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.480
It closed down, I think, last year and now it's an art gallery of some sort, I think.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.480
I have no idea.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.480
Yeah.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.720
They think that's what it was when I walked by.

07:16.720 --> 07:22.740
Um, there's still an arcade in the movie theater and there was a arcade upstairs, the Tilt

07:22.740 --> 07:27.040
Arcade, which is right by the Walk of Game, which is still there.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.320
The, there's, I don't think they've updated it in a while, but it's still there.

07:30.320 --> 07:34.440
And uh, yeah, it's kind of sad cause they're selling all these arcade machines, but seriously,

07:34.440 --> 07:35.560
some awesome deals.

07:35.560 --> 07:39.440
There's a Marvel versus Capcom machine for $300 on sale right now.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.680
Um, a BeatMania 5th Mix, which is like the old school movie.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.720
Don't tell anybody cause I'm going to buy it.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.720
For $5,000.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.440
It's a total rip off.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.440
That is ridiculous.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.440
That is ridiculous.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.440
I'm lying.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.400
I'm totally lying.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.240
It's really this much.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.240
That's it.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.240
Yeah.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.240
But Jamie wants it.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.240
So I'm not allowed to tell the listeners.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.240
No you're not.

08:00.240 --> 08:05.440
Um, so yeah, uh, there's that and uh, oh, this was the funniest thing of all though.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.040
Going to the little claw or what?

08:07.040 --> 08:08.040
Not the claw machine.

08:08.040 --> 08:11.900
You ever seen the ticket redemption machine where the light kind of goes around the marquee

08:11.900 --> 08:14.800
and you have to hit the stop button at a certain time and if you hit a stop button, then you

08:14.800 --> 08:15.800
win a prize?

08:15.800 --> 08:16.800
Okay.

08:16.800 --> 08:17.800
I posted this to my Twitter.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.160
Do you know what one of the prizes was in there?

08:19.160 --> 08:21.240
Still in a sealed box.

08:21.240 --> 08:25.480
A Game Boy Advance e-reader machine with cards.

08:25.480 --> 08:30.320
That might be a collector's item.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.480
I lolled so hard seeing that.

08:32.480 --> 08:38.360
It's on my Twitter at twitter.com slash sky S K I E. So anyway, um, let's talk about our

08:38.360 --> 08:39.360
gaming weeks.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.360
Okay.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.360
We're done with Tron talk.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.080
Even though I actually really want to play the game now after seeing the movie, like

08:44.080 --> 08:46.600
even though I hear it's really repetitive, like that's his biggest problem.

08:46.600 --> 08:50.600
Like just, I just want to know more about the story like, and I can't, I think everybody

08:50.600 --> 08:54.000
after going to see the movie that I went and saw it with yesterday, like went online and

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
started reading about Tron and like who the actors were in the movie and how it tied into

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
the eighties version.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.560
It's just, is that nerd-tastic?

09:00.560 --> 09:02.000
All right.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
How was your gaming week?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.840
Dark soccer, actual video games outside of Tron.

09:05.840 --> 09:11.120
Well, I, um, I'm playing world of Warcraft addict.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.120
No I'm not.

09:12.120 --> 09:17.040
No, I'm not because I'm still, I'm still playing Star Trek online and you can call me an addict

09:17.040 --> 09:18.040
for that.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.400
Double addict.

09:19.400 --> 09:26.880
I'm not addicted, but I said I'd give it a chance and I was like, I was seriously this

09:26.880 --> 09:29.800
close again to just going, forget it.

09:29.800 --> 09:34.200
Like by this close, I mean like holding my fingers, you know, a half an inch apart is

09:34.200 --> 09:37.640
like stupid goat people world sucks.

09:37.640 --> 09:43.120
Even though I like playing goat people, but I'm leveling faster, so I don't know what's

09:43.120 --> 09:44.120
up with that.

09:44.120 --> 09:48.760
Um, but it was, it's cool, you know, chatting with everyone in the guild and everything

09:48.760 --> 09:50.560
and that's pretty fun.

09:50.560 --> 09:55.640
Um, it still seems like more of the same to me, you know, but I'm giving it a chance.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.640
I'm somewhere new.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.640
I'm playing.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.640
Rob gave me some stuff.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.080
I'll give you lots of stuff.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.160
You have to play for a good month now.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.280
But isn't it good to be back?

10:06.280 --> 10:10.340
Well, I would ask you what you think of it, but because you've been playing a Draenei,

10:10.340 --> 10:14.560
you've really only seen the content that's in Burning Crusade, which I understand you

10:14.560 --> 10:16.320
should do what you want to do.

10:16.320 --> 10:21.160
Like don't roll another race just because it's somewhere else, but I helped you get

10:21.160 --> 10:22.160
somewhere else.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.160
So hopefully you'll be able to see some new content.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.160
And it still looks the same too.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.160
Well.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.560
Well, I mean, I didn't make it there last time.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.240
I'm in, what's the name of the stupid-

10:29.240 --> 10:30.240
Darnassus.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.240
Darnassus.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.240
Okay.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.240
It still looks like night elf stuff.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.240
Right.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.240
And Darnassus wasn't touched by Deathwing too.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.240
You have to, cause it's-

10:36.240 --> 10:37.920
He didn't take a big poop on it?

10:37.920 --> 10:38.920
He didn't.

10:38.920 --> 10:44.360
But once you take the boat to the ruins of Albertine, which used to be Albertine, uh,

10:44.360 --> 10:47.440
you'll start to see some of the damage and some of the better stuff, I think.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.080
I figured that I'm going to do that when I get like 20 and I'm like, what, 14 now and

10:51.080 --> 10:52.080
I've been playing three days.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.080
Yeah.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.080
You've been doing very well.

10:54.080 --> 11:00.920
Which it took me two weeks to get to 20 last time.

11:00.920 --> 11:06.440
So I'm, I'm, I'm going to keep going with it.

11:06.440 --> 11:12.640
I mean, I'll try, but like, like I said, you know, it's not something that I can keep doing

11:12.640 --> 11:13.640
consistently.

11:13.640 --> 11:19.280
I'm keeping my attachment to Star Trek Online, which by the way, episode three Star Trek

11:19.280 --> 11:20.600
Online came out.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
Gorgeous.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.600
Gorgeous.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.600
Gorgeous.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.240
Once a cataclysm or cataclysm, whatever you want to call it, uh, settles down a little

11:27.240 --> 11:28.240
bit.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.320
That's a internet meme, by the way, if you don't know, uh, once that settles down a little

11:31.320 --> 11:33.960
bit, I still want to go back and check out Star Trek Online.

11:33.960 --> 11:38.640
Hopefully DC Universe isn't out by that point and kind of derails everything, but I still

11:38.640 --> 11:41.680
want to go check it out a little bit, especially since they've changed so much, it sounds like

11:41.680 --> 11:43.760
since the beta that I originally had played.

11:43.760 --> 11:48.520
Well, and you know, I kind of, I'd like to try out the, the new stuff, but I'm not going

11:48.520 --> 11:53.600
to buy two boxes of upgrades unless I'm sure I'm going to play a little bit more.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.600
I don't blame it.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.840
And even then, you know, if I play, it's going to have to be in the form of, you know, month

11:58.840 --> 11:59.960
cards or something.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.880
It's still ridiculous that they're charging so much for Wrath of the Lich King.

12:02.880 --> 12:06.800
And I think that will come down, just kind of have to wait it out after, probably after

12:06.800 --> 12:10.320
the Christmas rush or something, it'll, it'll come down to try and woo new players into

12:10.320 --> 12:11.320
the game.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.280
Well, that's, that's kind of what I'm hoping for.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.080
I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to give up on it.

12:15.080 --> 12:20.040
I mean, like I said, if, if I keep playing it, it's going to be, well, I'll buy, um,

12:20.040 --> 12:24.220
you know, a month card to play because I'm not getting rid of my Star Trek Online subscription

12:24.220 --> 12:28.640
unless STO just starts getting ridiculously crappy.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.720
And right now though, my frustration with Star Trek Online is that there's really not

12:32.720 --> 12:38.040
a whole lot of new stuff for new characters and I want new factions.

12:38.040 --> 12:43.600
We're supposed, they sort of teased that we're supposed to be getting, um, Cardassian faction

12:43.600 --> 12:45.440
so I can keep up with the Cardassians.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.160
Wow, that's a bad joke.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.720
I'm not the first one to think of it either.

12:50.720 --> 12:55.800
Um, you know, I want to play, you know, the Romulan stuff that, you know, they're doing

12:55.800 --> 13:01.320
a lot of big stories for the Romulan factions and I really, really like what they're doing

13:01.320 --> 13:06.220
with the story because they're putting something in it for everybody and it's like, it really

13:06.220 --> 13:07.560
does have a feeling for me.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.040
Like I'll be chatting with Becky and we'll be talking about Deep Space Nine or something

13:11.040 --> 13:13.940
because that's, you know, right now both of us are going back and just rewatching all

13:13.940 --> 13:18.800
of Deep Space Nine in parts and, which would be like the 50 millionth time I've watched

13:18.800 --> 13:21.560
everything through on Deep Space Nine because it's my favorite.

13:21.560 --> 13:26.360
But like, um, I'll say, oh, and by the way, they did this in Star Trek Online and this,

13:26.360 --> 13:28.440
this led to this story and this.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.160
And she's like, sounds like you're talking like, you know, well, she hasn't said right

13:32.160 --> 13:36.600
out, but I feel like I'm talking about an episode and when they actually, when they

13:36.600 --> 13:41.640
bring everything up, it's like the way everything flows is like an episode of the show just

13:41.640 --> 13:42.640
without acting.

13:42.640 --> 13:46.000
That's good because just as someone who is a fan of the Star Trek series, Not Counting

13:46.000 --> 13:52.440
Enterprise, um, I, I really wish they would have another show, you know, I really want

13:52.440 --> 13:55.640
there to be another TV show and I understand that right now it's like all about the movies

13:55.640 --> 14:01.720
and don't even know that new movie was awesome, but I would just love there to be a new show

14:01.720 --> 14:05.880
in the next gen Voyager canon, Deep Space Nine canon.

14:05.880 --> 14:11.560
You know, I would like, um, well, you know, and I've been going back and reading the books,

14:11.560 --> 14:17.360
the, you know, the continuation books, which is really where, and this is going to be kind

14:17.360 --> 14:22.200
of a, I'm going to try not to veer too off the point, the, the book universe is very

14:22.200 --> 14:24.800
different than the game universe.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.760
The book universe is sort of like it's its own tangent.

14:27.760 --> 14:32.320
Um, what I like about the game universe is that it incorporated the first movie by saying

14:32.320 --> 14:41.200
that this is what happened in the prime timeline and the movie, as I said, is a new timeline

14:41.200 --> 14:45.320
so they can keep going with all these characters that you love and, you know, history that

14:45.320 --> 14:47.120
you know.

14:47.120 --> 14:55.000
And I'd really like to see, you know, even them do like a comic series or new series,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.240
you know, involving the Star Trek online universe or maybe the stuff that happened in between.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.240
Who knows?

14:59.240 --> 15:00.240
Anything's possible.

15:00.240 --> 15:04.040
Cause I love it and even, and they've, they've incorporated some of the enterprise stuff

15:04.040 --> 15:05.040
in there too.

15:05.040 --> 15:12.020
You know, even though I think it's kind of crappy, but um, it's, I've been very, very

15:12.020 --> 15:15.840
happy with Star Trek online, but like I said, I'm giving world of war crack a try.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.360
Um, I like my goat girl.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.440
She's dressed like a hoochie right now, but she can burn things.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.600
There you go.

15:22.600 --> 15:27.160
I do like, and I think this is new, the arcane missile thing.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.200
It's not new, but you, it's new for me.

15:30.200 --> 15:34.520
They, everything is at different levels now, so you might be getting it sooner than you

15:34.520 --> 15:35.520
would have before.

15:35.520 --> 15:40.440
Cause they rearranged everything when they did cataclysm and like some people get talents

15:40.440 --> 15:44.240
at a really early level that they wouldn't have seen till like level 40 before this.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.880
This arcane missile thing, they're just like, here, have this for free.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.200
What?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.640
And you don't have to, it's just random.

15:50.640 --> 15:57.120
You can randomly cast it and it doesn't cost anything and it's instant and you can kill

15:57.120 --> 15:58.120
lots of stuff with it.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.480
If you're thinking you specced for it somehow, so that's kinda, yeah, usually those free

16:01.480 --> 16:05.160
things are usually some type of speccing, but yeah, that's spending talent points.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.160
You spent your talent points.

16:06.160 --> 16:11.240
I had it before I got my talent points and then, so I don't play a mage, so I have no

16:11.240 --> 16:12.240
idea how it works.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.280
And then I'll double check my stuff real quick cause it's not going to screw up the show

16:15.280 --> 16:21.080
or anything, but it's like, well, I did pick arcane path, but I had everything before that.

16:21.080 --> 16:25.240
I think it's important for, I mean, I don't want to veer off the path too much and talk

16:25.240 --> 16:26.240
to my pet.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.500
I don't know how to get it.

16:27.500 --> 16:34.240
But I do think it's important for wow veterans to hear how newbies approach wow, because

16:34.240 --> 16:38.080
I think sometimes the wow veterans just assume people come into wow and they know everything

16:38.080 --> 16:39.440
and it's, it's hard.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.220
There's a lot to the game.

16:41.220 --> 16:44.880
So I think it's important that, you know, if you're a veteran of wow, you sometimes

16:44.880 --> 16:48.220
kind of hear what the new people are really thinking and some of the challenges and so

16:48.220 --> 16:49.220
forth.

16:49.220 --> 16:54.000
I'm not exactly new, but I didn't, but going on a hiatus, as long as you have with all

16:54.000 --> 16:55.740
the changes, it's, it's new to you.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.760
That's about an average though, every time I've gone on hiatus, I've taken about a year

16:58.760 --> 16:59.760
off.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.360
You know, I think last time I played was in February and then I quit when Star Trek online

17:03.360 --> 17:04.360
came out.

17:04.360 --> 17:08.720
So I think I actually just paid for another month so that a TR could get a free month.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.720
Nice.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.160
Which I'm very sorry that didn't work out for you.

17:11.160 --> 17:15.120
I thought that I could use another scroll, but they said, yeah, it's only one for account

17:15.120 --> 17:16.120
ever.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.120
I'm sorry.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.120
Uh, let me look at chat room really quick.

17:18.120 --> 17:22.520
Cause we want to get some questions out chat.orangelaunchradio.com a quick question from break man.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.800
Are the star Trek cartoons canon?

17:25.800 --> 17:26.800
Yes, actually.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.320
Um, the animated series is considered canon.

17:29.320 --> 17:30.320
All right.

17:30.320 --> 17:34.440
Uh, break man is also asking, do newbies still have to go find that wife in the barons?

17:34.440 --> 17:35.560
I don't think so.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.520
I don't play horde, so I'm not sure.

17:37.520 --> 17:43.540
Uh, but I believe due to the stupid mushrooms due to the shift, the mushrooms due to the

17:43.540 --> 17:49.720
shift of a burning crusade, or I'm sorry, due to the shift of, of Southern barons being

17:49.720 --> 17:50.720
its own zone.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.120
I don't believe that quest is there anymore.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.240
Stupid, stupid mushrooms.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.200
See that hasn't changed, but you'll get there.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.200
You'll get there.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.200
Yeah.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.200
And then someone had to start in badger badger, Rob.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.200
All right.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.640
I was already in my head.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.640
Let's move on.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.840
Loki, is there any games you've been playing?

18:04.840 --> 18:06.400
I know you don't play any MMOs right now.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.040
So what, what have you been up to?

18:08.040 --> 18:14.600
Um, I've been just playing grand theft auto and um, swords and poker or sword and poker

18:14.600 --> 18:15.600
too.

18:15.600 --> 18:21.160
I'm playing lots of sword and poker too.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.880
And I did actually play a little bit of, now it's a little confusing because I have both

18:24.880 --> 18:25.960
Tron games.

18:25.960 --> 18:30.240
I have the Tron legacy game and then also the Tron game, but I played Tron legacy a

18:30.240 --> 18:38.480
little bit and it's, it's all right if you, um, you race around in light cycles and um,

18:38.480 --> 18:39.480
the recognizers.

18:39.480 --> 18:46.320
Yeah, I just don't like tilt steering.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.320
I hate tilt steering and everything.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.000
It's just, it's not, it doesn't feel natural.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.960
So you must be playing it on PS3 with the six axis or what?

18:54.960 --> 18:55.960
No on the iPod.

18:55.960 --> 18:56.960
Oh, okay.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.480
I thought these were the retail games.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.000
No, no, no, no.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Um, no, it's just a tilt steering on the iPod to steer the bike.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.400
I hate that.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.640
Oh, okay.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.640
Got it.

19:09.640 --> 19:15.560
I prefer like, you know, my finger, um, yeah, that's pretty much it.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.680
I think I didn't play a whole lot.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.520
It's too busy yelling at Comcast.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.440
Oh, the internet's been down for still right.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.920
You were down last week and you're still down, right?

19:25.920 --> 19:26.920
They're dumb.

19:26.920 --> 19:27.920
Okay.

19:27.920 --> 19:28.920
They're dumb.

19:28.920 --> 19:32.120
We'll just put it that way.

19:32.120 --> 19:38.080
And no Comcast really doesn't care despite the fact, you know what certain Twitter people

19:38.080 --> 19:43.360
will say, um, and how they may seem concerned and ask you to email them and then they don't

19:43.360 --> 19:44.940
give a shit once you've emailed them.

19:44.940 --> 19:47.680
So you mad?

19:47.680 --> 19:54.860
Just slightly canceling TV with them actually because I'm pretty pissed off and it's not

19:54.860 --> 19:58.680
working all the way too because I can't use any of the on-demand stuff because the signal's

19:58.680 --> 19:59.680
not strong enough.

19:59.680 --> 20:00.680
That sucks.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.680
Sorry to hear it.

20:02.680 --> 20:07.500
Thankfully, thank you to my new Virgin mobile phone though that I have rooted.

20:07.500 --> 20:11.740
I can now tie into the Wi-Fi and that's a connected 3G network.

20:11.740 --> 20:15.360
So that has been a lifesaver I tell you.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.420
There you go.

20:17.420 --> 20:22.120
My gaming week has been mostly dominated with World of Warcraft cataclysm.

20:22.120 --> 20:26.800
I won't kind of go all the way back into it, but I hit level 85, which is the new max level

20:26.800 --> 20:28.960
this week, so shut.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.960
So that's good.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.880
I've been just trying to gear for heroics and I am geared for heroics now, so I'll be

20:32.880 --> 20:34.360
doing that soon.

20:34.360 --> 20:39.200
As far as other games go, not anything new, just some of the same old standbys like Rock

20:39.200 --> 20:43.480
Band 3, Super Meat Boy, and some of those games I've just been playing gradually over

20:43.480 --> 20:45.640
the past month, but not a whole lot.

20:45.640 --> 20:49.480
As you know, with the holidays coming up and everything, my gaming time has been kind of

20:49.480 --> 20:50.480
thin.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.120
But the good news is, with the huge break coming up, I don't know about some of you

20:54.120 --> 21:00.780
out there, but I have been given at work basically the entire time between Christmas and New

21:00.780 --> 21:02.000
Year's off.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.600
Our company does this whole closure thing where we have to take time off basically,

21:06.600 --> 21:10.560
which is, you know, I'm not gonna lie, I kind of welcome it, so it's gonna be a nice break.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.840
But I don't know what to do with myself for like nine days off in a row.

21:13.840 --> 21:18.020
I can't really afford to take any major trips right now, so I guess I'll sit at home and

21:18.020 --> 21:19.240
play some games.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.120
So that's good though, because I really need to just catch up on some things.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.960
So hopefully I'll get some gift cards for Christmas or something, I can go buy myself

21:24.960 --> 21:27.120
a couple new games, and beat them!

21:27.120 --> 21:29.060
That'd be great.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.760
So anyway, that does it for our gaming week.

21:30.760 --> 21:34.960
I hope you guys are having a lot of fun this week, and for the holidays, some of you guys

21:34.960 --> 21:37.120
get some new games that you can play through.

21:37.120 --> 21:41.480
You have to tell us all about it at chat.orangelauncheradio.com.

21:41.480 --> 21:45.140
Ziba in the chatroom says, my job does the same thing.

21:45.140 --> 21:47.360
It's not totally unheard of.

21:47.360 --> 21:52.500
DarkCircuitry in the chatroom says, internet equals Warcraft equals Rob's life at least.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.500
Not totally.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.840
I mean, yeah, I spend a lot of my free time playing Warcraft, but let's not forget, it

21:56.840 --> 21:58.760
just had a major expansion.

21:58.760 --> 22:02.860
It's third expansion just came out like last week, so of course, you know, that's kind

22:02.860 --> 22:06.760
of the focus right now, but you know, that'll die down once I've really experienced a lot

22:06.760 --> 22:07.760
of the new stuff.

22:07.760 --> 22:12.240
I don't really plan on rolling an alt or getting through all that and all that, so I'll have

22:12.240 --> 22:13.600
time to play a new game.

22:13.600 --> 22:18.320
And yes, I know how to go outdoors, I was in the city all weekend, so I do more than

22:18.320 --> 22:22.480
just sit on the computer and play WoW, but that is a lot of what I do, it's fun.

22:22.480 --> 22:27.440
Alright, anyhow, housekeeping, there is no show next week.

22:27.440 --> 22:31.800
We will not be having a show on the 26th due to the holidays, DarkCircuitry's gonna be

22:31.800 --> 22:32.800
out of town.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.800
Where are you going?

22:33.800 --> 22:34.800
You're going way up.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.800
Going to Washington.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
Washington, Washington!

22:36.800 --> 22:37.800
But not Seattle, right?

22:37.800 --> 22:38.800
You're going to...

22:38.800 --> 22:40.160
No, I'm going to Prosser.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.920
Which is more in the middle of nowhere or is it kind of a big city?

22:42.920 --> 22:43.920
Yeah.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.920
Okay, well...

22:44.920 --> 22:45.920
It's teeny.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
Very farmy.

22:46.920 --> 22:47.920
Have fun in the farm town.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.920
I'm growing in my netbook.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.400
There you go.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.860
Stay connected.

22:52.860 --> 22:56.160
And yeah, we'll just, you know, Loki and I will just be taking some time off for the

22:56.160 --> 22:59.960
holidays so we won't be here, but we will be back the week after in the new year with

22:59.960 --> 23:00.960
a new show.

23:00.960 --> 23:05.080
Otherwise, if you want to follow us on Twitter for all the updates about our show, twitter.com

23:05.080 --> 23:09.960
slash o-l-r, we'll also be taking your Twitter topics there, facebook.com slash orange lounge

23:09.960 --> 23:13.000
radio as well.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.080
More comments from our chat room, chat dot orange lounge radio dot com.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.160
Tiger Claw says, Sky will just play Cataclysm for nine days.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.280
No, I'm not going to play for nine days straight.

23:21.280 --> 23:25.040
I'm not going to lie, I'm going to play a lot with the time off, I'm not going to play

23:25.040 --> 23:26.520
the whole time, come on.

23:26.520 --> 23:31.920
Besides, I have Knights of the Clicky on Facebook I've got to be playing too.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.860
Someone sent me an invite to that, no thanks.

23:34.860 --> 23:36.240
It's a real time waster.

23:36.240 --> 23:41.480
Jim Sally in our chat room says, if you're bored next week, Rob, do a show every day.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.080
There's three hours taken care of.

23:43.080 --> 23:47.520
That'd be kind of fun, but I don't know, I think I'd run out of things to talk about

23:47.520 --> 23:49.280
and then we get kind of scary.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.080
Would the listeners help me do a show?

23:51.080 --> 23:52.080
I don't know.

23:52.080 --> 23:57.440
I'm talking about all the stuff coming out, oh, wait, no, no.

23:57.440 --> 24:01.740
There's already a bunch of live shows at All Games Radio where we do our show and obviously

24:01.740 --> 24:05.160
we wouldn't want to bump any of those shows, we don't have the right to.

24:05.160 --> 24:13.120
There's plenty of fine shows on the network, so let them do their thing and we'll see.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.960
William Murderface in our chat room says, I love that name by the way, Rob, you need

24:16.960 --> 24:20.520
a drunken Rocky marathon.

24:20.520 --> 24:24.520
I don't know, I've been doing Rocky for so long now, I don't think I need to marathon

24:24.520 --> 24:25.520
it.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.760
There you go.

24:27.760 --> 24:31.280
And JV Monner in our chat room says, oh yeah, more people need to play Pinball FX2.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.280
Agreed.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.480
Pinball FX2 is great.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.880
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.920
Let's go to some gaming news.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.920
Believe it or not, there is still some going on this week, even though it is the holiday

24:41.920 --> 24:42.920
period.

24:42.920 --> 24:43.920
Loki.

24:43.920 --> 24:50.060
Yes, so apparently Microsoft is wanting, obviously, to improve upon what they've already created.

24:50.060 --> 24:55.680
They want to quadruple the Kinect's accuracy, and the way they're going to do that is by

24:55.680 --> 25:04.960
unrestricted the camera from the 320 by 240 pixel resolution to unlock it to 640 by 480,

25:04.960 --> 25:09.840
and unfortunately they can't do that right now because of the limitations put on by the

25:09.840 --> 25:17.560
console's USB controller interface, which has to keep open enough to support other USB

25:17.560 --> 25:24.320
based peripherals like batteries and rechargers, but if they somehow enable it to where, you

25:24.320 --> 25:33.240
know, they would limit you to so many devices or whatever plugged in via USB, then they

25:33.240 --> 25:38.200
would be able to unlock the bandwidth to be able to stream more data from the Kinect and

25:38.200 --> 25:44.120
allowing you to basically quadruple the resolution of the camera, so it'd be able to detect,

25:44.120 --> 25:47.600
they said, even like finger movements and stuff like that, that can't be done right

25:47.600 --> 25:48.600
now.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.480
So that's kind of cool, and they said that can all be accomplished with a firmware update,

25:51.480 --> 25:55.720
so that is kind of cool and kind of makes you wonder why it wasn't there in the first

25:55.720 --> 25:56.720
place.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.840
Well, they said right there it's because of the limitations of the console, because right

25:59.840 --> 26:05.400
now they have to, you know, they have to play nice with all the other peripherals on there.

26:05.400 --> 26:09.760
I don't under, well, I mean, I guess the USB controller, so I was gonna say I don't understand

26:09.760 --> 26:16.120
why they couldn't just unrestricted the one port for the Kinect, but I don't know, it

26:16.120 --> 26:19.320
would be difficult to do that.

26:19.320 --> 26:24.000
As long as whatever they do doesn't impact the older consoles, like, that's my fear,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.720
is that, you know, as they keep talking about, we're gonna upgrade all this stuff for firmware,

26:26.720 --> 26:31.440
we're gonna do all these upgrades, oh, but if you have the old white Xboxes, then you're

26:31.440 --> 26:32.440
fucked.

26:32.440 --> 26:33.440
Well, all you need is...

26:33.440 --> 26:34.440
It's only gonna work with the 360Ss.

26:34.440 --> 26:38.880
You just need the adapter that comes with it, but I think that's just, that's just for

26:38.880 --> 26:39.880
power.

26:39.880 --> 26:43.320
I mean, they had the data, they just had more power coming through there.

26:43.320 --> 26:48.040
I guess what they could do is say, okay, you know, when running the Kinect, you can only

26:48.040 --> 26:52.360
hook up, like, you know, one device or two devices or something like that.

26:52.360 --> 26:57.060
Maybe that's the way they could get around it, or, I don't know.

26:57.060 --> 27:01.640
It's a little tricky, but I could see them doing it, especially if it's gonna make things

27:01.640 --> 27:04.340
that much better.

27:04.340 --> 27:10.440
But at the same time, we really need the games to be four times better anyways.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.640
At least, you know, some of them.

27:12.640 --> 27:17.520
Well, I'm not convinced, I'm not convinced that even if you make the technology better,

27:17.520 --> 27:23.120
that there's enough games with really new ideas there yet to substantiate it, if that

27:23.120 --> 27:24.120
makes sense?

27:24.120 --> 27:25.120
Yeah.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.440
Like, you know, Dance Central is awesome, but, you know, as far as a lot of those other

27:28.440 --> 27:34.720
adventures and those sorts of games go, the fitness games, I'm kind of over it.

27:34.720 --> 27:41.920
Like, you know, show me how Kinect is going to make my life as a gamer even more awesomer,

27:41.920 --> 27:45.960
and yes, that's a term, more awesomer.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.880
You know, show me how Kinect's gonna do that.

27:48.880 --> 27:54.160
Kinect is still kind of a flashy thing right now.

27:54.160 --> 27:58.960
I haven't seen it really truly integrated into the hardcore games that I'm used to.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.960
You know what I mean?

27:59.960 --> 28:01.340
Yeah, I know what you mean.

28:01.340 --> 28:06.700
So at one point, I'm kind of like, don't waste your time with this upgrade to the technology

28:06.700 --> 28:11.060
unless you have the games to kind of back that up that aren't just more exercise games

28:11.060 --> 28:12.360
and more dance games.

28:12.360 --> 28:17.960
Well, I think they're just working on, you know, having that available for when they

28:17.960 --> 28:21.880
do get to that point as far as game development goes, because yeah, some of the stuff that

28:21.880 --> 28:26.080
is available right now, it's very basic with what they have you doing.

28:26.080 --> 28:33.160
You know, Dance Central's a pretty good example of what it can do, but some other games that

28:33.160 --> 28:37.080
kind of just have these modes tacked on like Harry Potter and stuff where it's just an

28:37.080 --> 28:40.600
on rails thing that you, it's very unnecessary.

28:40.600 --> 28:44.360
I mean, I don't know.

28:44.360 --> 28:54.120
They need less like, you know, fitness games, less snowboarding-esque games, just some better

28:54.120 --> 28:55.120
ideas.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.440
Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

28:58.440 --> 29:02.200
Derek H. wants to give a cheap plug to connectable.net.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.600
Games are only scratching the surface.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.600
You know, that's a good thought.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.760
I'm looking at some of the stuff here that they have, and of course I've been kind of

29:06.760 --> 29:10.960
reading about the hacks on the internet, and this website connectable.net seems to be kind

29:10.960 --> 29:15.280
of a collection of the different sorts of hacks that are out there, like lots of YouTubes,

29:15.280 --> 29:20.920
and I'm seeing things like an air piano where you can use your hand to play the piano on

29:20.920 --> 29:21.920
connectable.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.880
I mean, it's not exactly like a real piano, but still it's an impressive little thing

29:25.880 --> 29:28.600
that they're doing with the technology.

29:28.600 --> 29:34.260
You gotta wonder if Microsoft's kind of letting this hack thing go a little bit just to see

29:34.260 --> 29:36.600
what people are coming up with so they can steal it.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.600
You know what I want?

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600
Hmm?

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
The Kinect experiment.

29:39.600 --> 29:44.440
No, seriously, this is me being serious, because I really want a Theremin.

29:44.440 --> 29:45.440
Maybe Kinect music.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.440
Why not?

29:46.440 --> 29:48.240
Since there was Wii music, let's have Kinect music.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.320
And actually have it be good?

29:50.320 --> 29:51.380
Perhaps.

29:51.380 --> 29:55.360
Let's not, because once again we've figured out that, you know, porting stuff over from

29:55.360 --> 30:00.320
the Wii or, you know, basically copying the ideas that you've done on the Wii, not exactly

30:00.320 --> 30:04.840
a great plan, because then a lot of these games just come out very cheesy.

30:04.840 --> 30:12.360
I mean, even some of the games are just, I mean, like Deca Sports and Game Party, I mean,

30:12.360 --> 30:14.800
it's just, that's stuff that they have on the Wii right now.

30:14.800 --> 30:20.200
We don't need a, you know, ton of mini game collections and little sports compilations

30:20.200 --> 30:21.200
and stuff like that.

30:21.200 --> 30:25.560
Just come up with something, something cool, you know?

30:25.560 --> 30:29.800
And something, something that doesn't even necessarily need to use your whole body, like

30:29.800 --> 30:32.840
head tracking in a first person shooter would be pretty awesome.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.760
That would be actually really awesome.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.840
You know, it's completely optional.

30:37.840 --> 30:38.840
Like to duck?

30:38.840 --> 30:39.840
You have to duck.

30:39.840 --> 30:40.840
And you should like do that on your couch.

30:40.840 --> 30:41.840
No, not even.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.840
That's, that's dumb.

30:42.840 --> 30:43.840
Really?

30:43.840 --> 30:44.840
Not even the ducking thing.

30:44.840 --> 30:48.960
But I'm saying like, you could poke your head a little bit to the side to kind of get a

30:48.960 --> 30:49.960
different perspective.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.600
It's just a little bit more immersive.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.640
Wouldn't take that much, you know, technology.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.640
And you know...

30:55.640 --> 30:58.920
Could you imagine time crisis done with head tracking?

30:58.920 --> 31:02.200
It would be cool, but I'm kind of sick of time crisis.

31:02.200 --> 31:06.920
I mean, I'm just saying, I'm taking that concept to where, you know, say that you duck under,

31:06.920 --> 31:12.480
you know, a divider and you can peek over it and that type of thing.

31:12.480 --> 31:15.360
But I'm just trying to think of a solution for like, you know, people that want to play

31:15.360 --> 31:18.720
with controllers on a, you know, on a couch or something like that.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.560
And they can make everything very minimal and optional.

31:21.560 --> 31:26.760
I mean, you don't have to have, say like for the next Gears of War game or something like

31:26.760 --> 31:28.120
that, could have head tracking.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.080
And that would be the extent of the Kinect support.

31:30.080 --> 31:36.000
None of this, move your arm in like a karate chop to cut through, you know, enemy.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
I don't know.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.920
Here's a really interesting comment from chat from chat.orangelodgevideo.com.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.040
Ray Craft says, time crisis with head tracking.

31:44.040 --> 31:47.000
Yeah, that's called Police 911.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.680
Very interesting comment because yeah, Police 911 used a dance games technology.

31:50.680 --> 31:55.200
It was basically Para Para Paradise, you know, the setup to kind of do this different sort

31:55.200 --> 31:56.200
of game.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.200
What was mocap?

31:57.200 --> 31:58.200
All the like mocap boxing and all that.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.200
Yeah, the whole mocap thing.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.800
That was the same theory, but I'm saying that now with the Kinect, something like that is

32:02.800 --> 32:03.800
actually really possible.

32:03.800 --> 32:04.800
Sure.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.960
Just like, you know, Para Para is possible in the home, but that's, that's that dance

32:07.960 --> 32:09.040
masters game.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.040
Which I need to get.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.040
Yeah.

32:11.040 --> 32:14.240
Cause I, Oh, I forgot to mention that for my thing, but I got to connect for December

32:14.240 --> 32:15.240
ween.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.240
Congrats.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.240
Yay.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.240
All right.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.240
For Festivus?

32:19.240 --> 32:20.240
December ween.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.240
Is that what you call it?

32:21.240 --> 32:22.240
I'm going to call it December ween.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.240
December ween.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.240
Awesome.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.240
All right.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.240
Chat.orangelodgevideo.com.

32:26.240 --> 32:31.200
If you want to lend your own comments, lots of comments there, just kind of, um, on that

32:31.200 --> 32:32.200
story.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.200
I like that.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.200
Well, let's go back to talking about wow for a minute.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.200
Sorry guys.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.000
But you know, I know some of you are wow haters and that's fine.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.800
People are going to like what they like, but you can't ignore this world of Warcraft shatters

32:41.800 --> 32:48.160
a record this week yet again, and probably to no one's surprise cataclysm is sold 3.3

32:48.160 --> 32:55.200
million units within 24 hours of its release becoming the fastest selling PC game of all

32:55.200 --> 32:56.200
time.

32:56.200 --> 33:00.560
The game that it beat of course was Wrath of the Lich King World of Warcraft 2.8 million

33:00.560 --> 33:02.680
copies back in 2008.

33:02.680 --> 33:06.320
They didn't say how much of that 3.3 million was digital.

33:06.320 --> 33:09.960
This was of course the first expansion that Blizzard had launched digitally, which was

33:09.960 --> 33:13.880
a little bit of a controversy in some ways because, uh, you know, all those midnight

33:13.880 --> 33:18.000
launches certainly had a few less people at them due to the digital launch.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.200
But what I think is very interesting about this is I think it shows you that of those

33:22.200 --> 33:28.960
12 million subscribers or whatever, 3.3 million are pretty hardcore because they all had to

33:28.960 --> 33:33.880
have the game the first day and I totally admit that I fall into that category.

33:33.880 --> 33:39.080
But it's left a lot of people asking like, well, where does the other 9 million go?

33:39.080 --> 33:42.680
And I'm wondering, well, has cataclysm launched in every country?

33:42.680 --> 33:46.680
But certainly there's a gap there and I think that's only day one, I think too.

33:46.680 --> 33:51.320
I mean, some people, you know, couldn't make it over the day or waited a little bit or

33:51.320 --> 33:52.720
they're getting it as a gift.

33:52.720 --> 33:56.160
And I think some people are honestly having to wait like a month because, you know, the

33:56.160 --> 34:00.440
economy the way it is, I know there's certain people in my guild that are like, uh, not

34:00.440 --> 34:04.360
going to be doing cataclysm until the new year at least because just can't afford it.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.360
It's too much.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.080
So, you know, I think there's a lot of people that just don't do it.

34:08.080 --> 34:12.000
Or is cataclysm like a lot of that stuff like end game because I could see maybe some people

34:12.000 --> 34:14.780
just starting off, they're saying, eh, I don't need it.

34:14.780 --> 34:21.080
A lot of it is because the stuff that affected the pre-end game, you know, the zero to 60

34:21.080 --> 34:24.320
experience, you don't need this expansion to experience any of that.

34:24.320 --> 34:29.400
That was all a free upgrade basically because they destroyed the old world and ushered in

34:29.400 --> 34:30.960
this new one.

34:30.960 --> 34:37.340
However, the whole Worgen and Goblin experience, which are really well done starting areas

34:37.340 --> 34:41.960
just as far as like immersing in story and everything, you can't do unless you have cataclysm.

34:41.960 --> 34:48.480
So you can't do those new races, but you know, you can still roll a Draenei like Dark Soccer

34:48.480 --> 34:52.920
is and at level 15 or whatever, head over to the other continent and experience some

34:52.920 --> 34:56.600
of the cataclysm stuff without really needing the cataclysm expansion.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.120
So kind of interesting.

34:59.120 --> 35:03.880
Other important news out of Blizzard and this isn't about WoW, but this could be about what

35:03.880 --> 35:05.680
ends up killing WoW.

35:05.680 --> 35:06.680
That's right.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.480
Blizzard might actually be making the game that is going to kill WoW.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.520
They're making their own WoW killer.

35:11.520 --> 35:17.980
Frank Pierce in an interview with Destructoid confirmed that the earlier rumor was true

35:17.980 --> 35:21.980
that the next MMO that they are making is called Titan.

35:21.980 --> 35:24.080
At least right now that's a code name.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.680
That doesn't mean that's the finalized release name of the game.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.920
That's just the code name.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.880
So it also kind of lends a little credit to the fact that that leaked list might have

35:32.880 --> 35:33.880
been true.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.760
I don't remember if we talked about that leaked list on this show or if that was on Hoardhouse

35:36.760 --> 35:42.100
because it's a little more Blizzard centric, but all I can say is that if you've seen that

35:42.100 --> 35:46.580
leaked list of release dates and names and so forth, all that shit is subject to change

35:46.580 --> 35:52.500
because Blizzard is notorious for saying, we will put it out when it's ready and not

35:52.500 --> 35:53.900
a minute before.

35:53.900 --> 35:57.280
So you know, take a lot of that with a grain of salt.

35:57.280 --> 36:01.920
Anyhow, more quote here in the interview with Destructoid, quote, the media is not supposed

36:01.920 --> 36:03.840
to know anything about Titan.

36:03.840 --> 36:09.240
It's our next gen MMO and we've only started, excuse me, we've only started talking about

36:09.240 --> 36:12.960
it in a limited fashion because we want to leverage the fact that we're working on something

36:12.960 --> 36:16.680
like that for the purpose of recruiting, getting some of the best talent of the industry on

36:16.680 --> 36:19.120
the product, on the project.

36:19.120 --> 36:25.760
So they are up to something, but that something is at least a good three years away, if not

36:25.760 --> 36:27.160
more.

36:27.160 --> 36:29.200
So enjoy WoW in the meantime.

36:29.200 --> 36:33.520
Otherwise, I'm kind of curious as to what this is, but they probably won't even do an

36:33.520 --> 36:38.840
announcement until like Blizzcon 2012 or something.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.600
It's a ways out there guys.

36:40.600 --> 36:45.440
But it's interesting to know that that part of the rumor was true because I think I passed

36:45.440 --> 36:47.800
it off on a Hoard House's fan wank.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.600
So sometimes I can be wrong about things.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.320
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

36:52.320 --> 36:53.320
Pac-Man Fever.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.320
Nah.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.320
You remember that song, don't you?

36:55.320 --> 36:56.320
That's old school.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.320
Yes, I do.

36:57.320 --> 36:58.320
Of course I remember that song.

36:58.320 --> 36:59.960
Well, so do the folks, um.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.200
That song's older than most of our listeners, you know.

37:02.200 --> 37:06.360
Well, so the folks at Rock Band, they remember it and actually it came out the same year

37:06.360 --> 37:07.360
as Tron.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.360
Awesome.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.360
Ooh.

37:09.360 --> 37:15.200
So the Pac-Man Fever album will be on Rock Band Download Content.

37:15.200 --> 37:20.860
And that's supposed to be early 2001 and it will have, as I said, Pac-Man Fever and Do

37:20.860 --> 37:24.480
the Donkey Kong and Froggy's Lament.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.680
Just so you guys know, these songs were actually kind of terrible.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.680
Like-

37:28.680 --> 37:29.680
But pull up Pac-Man Fever.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.680
Here.

37:30.680 --> 37:42.080
Like, you know.

37:42.080 --> 37:45.680
But it was, it was popular when it came out, I mean.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.640
I remember skating at the roller rate to this song.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.640
So do I.

37:49.640 --> 37:57.160
I'm totally dating myself, but.

37:57.160 --> 38:00.460
This song was really just written, this whole album was just a little like video game tie

38:00.460 --> 38:01.460
in song.

38:01.460 --> 38:04.080
It was really just written to cash in on the whole craze.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.080
One hit Wonderband.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.640
You don't want me to find the 7up commercial.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.840
I've shown you the 7up commercial.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.600
I think, yes, a long time ago on this show, yes.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.800
Um, but yeah, it's coming out.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.800
I get it.

38:15.800 --> 38:19.040
I wouldn't mind having some Pac-Man Fever.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.920
It'd be that lol song you pull up at parties.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.480
You know, everybody has the lol songs for Rock Band.

38:24.480 --> 38:27.480
Like the Cartman version of Poker Face is always a good lol song.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.480
You know, I didn't download that.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.480
I vetoed that.

38:29.480 --> 38:30.480
Really?

38:30.480 --> 38:32.240
So, but you know what my song is?

38:32.240 --> 38:34.040
Uh, Still Alive from Portal.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.400
No, Skullcrusher Mountain.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.400
Oh, okay.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.400
That's a good lol song.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.400
That's a good one.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.400
Skullcrusher Mountain.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.400
Alright.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.400
So there you go.

38:42.400 --> 38:45.280
Uh, what?

38:45.280 --> 38:48.120
The other songs on the album sound kind of funny.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.060
I haven't really heard any of those other ones.

38:50.060 --> 38:52.520
It's been ages since I've listened to any of the other ones.

38:52.520 --> 38:56.280
I actually did have that on vinyl back in the day.

38:56.280 --> 38:57.280
Wow.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.680
That's a collector's note.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.680
Hold on.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.200
Let me pull it up here so you can hear a little bit here.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.200
If you want to.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.720
Here's a little bit of Do the Donkey Kong.

39:03.720 --> 39:14.680
If you want to know what this song is about.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.680
I got Pac-Man Fever.

39:16.680 --> 39:17.680
Alright.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.680
There you go.

39:19.680 --> 39:39.400
Um, so when the whole ESPN streaming was announced for, or I should say when it came out as part

39:39.400 --> 39:45.560
of the November dashboard update for the Xbox 360, um, some people unfortunately were unable

39:45.560 --> 39:52.520
to participate in that streaming and those would be folks that had Bright House, which

39:52.520 --> 39:59.000
is owned by Time Warner, as their cable provider.

39:59.000 --> 40:06.680
Unfortunately those people were unable to actually get the ESPN app to work correctly.

40:06.680 --> 40:13.080
But now it says apparently that this is going to be coming to those people that were unable

40:13.080 --> 40:19.080
to have it before, and this is coming from the ESPN website.

40:19.080 --> 40:23.760
The way it works, I guess, is when a Time Warner or Bright House user turns on their

40:23.760 --> 40:31.780
Xbox 360 and tries to access the ESPN app, it'll direct them to the ESPN activation page

40:31.780 --> 40:36.120
where they have to authenticate their account with Bright House or Time Warner.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.080
Then it'll be given an access code.

40:38.080 --> 40:44.440
Once you have that, you would, um, I guess you're gonna be able to actually use the streaming

40:44.440 --> 40:45.440
service now.

40:45.440 --> 40:49.200
So that's kinda neat, that they're not locked out of it anymore.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.400
Guess some money exchanged hands or something like that.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.000
I always thought it was interesting that, like, whenever I would connect to the ESPN

40:55.000 --> 41:00.540
live thing, and granted I don't, like, Uber, follow sports and all that, although I won

41:00.540 --> 41:04.700
tickets to a Kings game at work, and, like, I'm gonna be, like, right in the front of

41:04.700 --> 41:05.700
a section.

41:05.700 --> 41:09.120
I'm excited, actually, even though I don't, you know, it's like the two worst teams in

41:09.120 --> 41:10.120
the league playing each other.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.120
But I don't care!

41:11.120 --> 41:12.120
I'm gonna have fun.

41:12.120 --> 41:16.360
So the ESPN thing for, like, when I get my once-in-a-great-while basketball thing, I've

41:16.360 --> 41:19.800
looked at it, like, once or twice, I always thought it was kinda weird that, like, the

41:19.800 --> 41:23.480
whole Comcast logo was in the corner, I'm like, it knows.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.480
It's aware.

41:24.480 --> 41:27.620
I mean, I know it's just reading my IP, and so it can tell, and, you know, probably the

41:27.620 --> 41:31.960
gateway I'm going through and what have you, but it always kinda struck me as interesting.

41:31.960 --> 41:32.960
I don't know.

41:32.960 --> 41:36.640
I don't know if I wanna open this can of worms and make me sound even more ignorant, but

41:36.640 --> 41:37.640
whatever.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.000
I've gotta ask this question.

41:39.000 --> 41:45.320
Is the reason how Time Warner and all these companies are able to block this because of

41:45.320 --> 41:52.720
the fact that net neutrality didn't actually work out or was, like, they found that it's

41:52.720 --> 41:59.280
not in the courts or whatever, that it's not actually exist, that net neutrality shouldn't

41:59.280 --> 42:00.280
exist?

42:00.280 --> 42:04.880
Well, how can Time Warner block this when it's on the internet?

42:04.880 --> 42:05.880
You know what I mean?

42:05.880 --> 42:11.200
It's just, it's just like how, you know, they go in the squabbles with, you know, um, like

42:11.200 --> 42:16.800
Fox or whatever, all of a sudden blacked out on a certain cable provider because they don't

42:16.800 --> 42:21.400
wanna pay certain royalties or whatever, so it may have been that these, like, Time Warner

42:21.400 --> 42:28.880
Bright House didn't wanna, you know, pay ESPN or whatever, or something to that effect,

42:28.880 --> 42:29.880
I'm thinking.

42:29.880 --> 42:34.400
That's right, but that's also not the internet, that's TV, so I was always, it always kind

42:34.400 --> 42:35.400
of fascinated me.

42:35.400 --> 42:39.120
But it's TV content, though, I don't know how that exactly works with, like, streaming

42:39.120 --> 42:42.640
on the web and stuff like that, and if you can get to it, because I know, like, some

42:42.640 --> 42:49.960
places you can't, um, you can't stream, like, certain games on, um, the web, you know, depending

42:49.960 --> 42:53.840
on your location or something like that, because of blackouts and...

42:53.840 --> 42:57.520
If you're a Time Warner user, would you be able to get around this just by spoofing your

42:57.520 --> 42:58.520
IP?

42:58.520 --> 42:59.920
Maybe?

42:59.920 --> 43:02.200
I'm not sure.

43:02.200 --> 43:05.880
I bet there's websites out of there with more devious information than things I've read.

43:05.880 --> 43:09.360
But you know what, I'm not really gonna pay attention to this whole streaming app until

43:09.360 --> 43:16.760
they have ESPN 8, the Ocho, with all sorts of extreme sports and dodgeball.

43:16.760 --> 43:20.640
Now, actually, I did try to watch, remember when dodgeball came out and stuff, and then

43:20.640 --> 43:24.600
shortly after that they actually did have dodgeball on, like, one of the ESPNs or Spike

43:24.600 --> 43:25.600
or something like that?

43:25.600 --> 43:26.600
That's right, they did, they did.

43:26.600 --> 43:27.600
It was boring.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.720
It goes to show you, it's just a movie.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.800
It's not exciting in real life.

43:32.800 --> 43:37.360
But it's an awesome 8-bit NES video game, just so you know.

43:37.360 --> 43:38.360
That's true.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.400
And a Game Boy Advance launch title.

43:40.400 --> 43:44.160
It's just like if someone, you know, if for whatever reason they decide, hey, you know

43:44.160 --> 43:48.360
what, it'd be awesome if we have some people running around in an arena throwing Frisbees

43:48.360 --> 43:53.680
with little lights on the outside of them and playing tag, you know, um, kind of like

43:53.680 --> 43:59.280
Tron, but, you know, Disc Wars and stuff like that, that would not be fun to watch more

43:59.280 --> 44:00.280
than once.

44:00.280 --> 44:04.960
Uh, Jvmon in our chat room asks, but Sky, why would you go out of your way to do that

44:04.960 --> 44:06.500
for ESPN?

44:06.500 --> 44:10.600
If you're that into ESPN, you probably already have all their channels.

44:10.600 --> 44:17.120
True, but I'm going by that hacker mentality of, because I can, and I'm not gonna be told

44:17.120 --> 44:18.120
no.

44:18.120 --> 44:25.360
I mean, isn't that kind of why people install Linux on toasters, because they can, you know?

44:25.360 --> 44:28.160
And you can't is not a suitable answer.

44:28.160 --> 44:34.840
I consider that as, I'm a power user, so, you know, if I want Linux to be on my toast,

44:34.840 --> 44:40.160
then that'd be kind of cool to put Linux on a toaster and then have it print stuff on

44:40.160 --> 44:42.640
your toast, if that were possible.

44:42.640 --> 44:44.600
They make a coffee printer.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.600
Coffee printer?

44:45.600 --> 44:46.600
That?

44:46.600 --> 44:47.600
Oh, that does, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

44:47.600 --> 44:53.000
Uh, Derek H. in our chat room tries to clarify, kind of cheating though, Derek H. in our chat

44:53.000 --> 44:55.600
room tries to clarify and break things down for me a little bit.

44:55.600 --> 44:59.760
ESPN3 is a paid service that the ISP has to buy.

44:59.760 --> 45:04.840
So spoofing your IP won't matter because the content can't get through the Time Warner

45:04.840 --> 45:05.840
routers.

45:05.840 --> 45:06.840
That's still disappointing.

45:06.840 --> 45:10.800
I mean, I kind of thought once content was on the internet, everybody was supposed to

45:10.800 --> 45:11.800
get it.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.800
I mean, I, I get it now.

45:12.800 --> 45:16.080
I get the reasons why it doesn't work, but it sucks.

45:16.080 --> 45:23.360
Anyhow, uh, JV Mon also, I'm sorry, Rama in our chat room says, Sky getting into ESPN,

45:23.360 --> 45:24.720
he loses 20 gay points.

45:24.720 --> 45:28.400
Hey, hey, hey, hey, there's lots of gay guys that are into sports.

45:28.400 --> 45:32.280
In fact, I'm actually taking, one of my best friends, I'm taking to this game with me because

45:32.280 --> 45:36.880
he likes sports a lot and he likes basketballs and he happens to be to gay.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.400
So there you go.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.360
Anyhow, let's move on.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.520
More news going on.

45:42.520 --> 45:48.000
PlayStation app on the iPhone, not here yet, but here's the deal.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.200
A PlayStation app has been announced for phones.

45:51.200 --> 45:55.800
It's Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is releasing this, the official PlayStation app

45:55.800 --> 45:56.800
in Europe.

45:56.800 --> 46:00.640
Uh, you're going to be doing some PlayStation network interaction through your iPhone or

46:00.640 --> 46:01.640
Android device.

46:01.640 --> 46:07.240
Let me think, could that be buying games and spending money and my points through the phone?

46:07.240 --> 46:08.920
That's gotta be one of it, right?

46:08.920 --> 46:13.720
Yeah, you're not going to be playing games on this, but you can look at trophies and

46:13.720 --> 46:17.640
you can look and see if your friends are on or offline or what have you, and you can also

46:17.640 --> 46:21.240
see the official blog, at least in Europe, because this is being released as a Europe

46:21.240 --> 46:22.240
product.

46:22.240 --> 46:28.240
It is coming out soon in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands.

46:28.240 --> 46:32.200
There are more countries set to be added to that list, but no word if the US is one of

46:32.200 --> 46:33.440
them, but I would think so.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.120
I mean, how could it not be?

46:35.120 --> 46:36.120
One would hope so.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.120
I would certainly think so.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.840
And again, we are sort of the redheaded stepchild of the world.

46:39.840 --> 46:44.880
Well it is, it is interesting that with all these rumors we've had lately of the Sony

46:44.880 --> 46:49.960
phone and the photos of it in action and all that, that they are acknowledging at least

46:49.960 --> 46:54.240
that, you know, the iPhone still has a huge ass market share, so they ought to put something

46:54.240 --> 46:55.240
official on it.

46:55.240 --> 46:59.500
No, they need to stop wasting their time with this crap and actually deliver on the stuff

46:59.500 --> 47:03.560
that they promised us way back in the day before all this stuff was coming out.

47:03.560 --> 47:08.280
Like for example, we would have trophy rooms in home where we can show off our trophies

47:08.280 --> 47:11.360
and they would be really cool interactive things and people could walk through and do

47:11.360 --> 47:12.360
that.

47:12.360 --> 47:14.600
It's still not there.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.660
What the hell?

47:16.660 --> 47:17.660
Come on.

47:17.660 --> 47:22.000
Do what you promised and stop wasting the damn time.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Loki's a little bitter.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
I know a little bit.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
No, not that it matters.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.200
I would never go in the home again anyways because it's a waste of time.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.640
I'll bag on Apple for a little bit for a minute though.

47:30.640 --> 47:31.640
There is so much.

47:31.640 --> 47:37.000
That's why Game Center sucks because there's so much trash out there in the app store,

47:37.000 --> 47:38.920
especially stuff that is free.

47:38.920 --> 47:43.560
Like I kid you not, I downloaded a free app the other day and the game itself is all right,

47:43.560 --> 47:48.680
but if you want to unlock, here's how you get quote unquote achievements in Game Center.

47:48.680 --> 47:54.200
You can get 50 points of achievements for emailing a friend about the game.

47:54.200 --> 48:01.240
You can get another like 75 points for posting to your Facebook wall about the game and like

48:01.240 --> 48:05.960
all these things that have nothing to do with actually playing the game itself and I just

48:05.960 --> 48:09.440
think there needs to be some type of quality control.

48:09.440 --> 48:13.440
Like I feel like Microsoft's put a little bit more quality control in achievements.

48:13.440 --> 48:17.520
Granted there's some pretty asinine achievements out there too and some of them have to do

48:17.520 --> 48:20.120
with, you know, download content and things like that, but I don't know.

48:20.120 --> 48:24.760
I just look at Game Center and I go, sometimes leaving this stuff wide open is a little too

48:24.760 --> 48:28.680
open, but maybe that's just me.

48:28.680 --> 48:32.560
Sometimes I just go lolz.

48:32.560 --> 48:37.160
Going back to ESPN3 for a little bit because I find this conversation in our chatroom humorous

48:37.160 --> 48:42.560
at chat.orangelaungerated.com, Derek H says, oh my God, I'm checking out ESPN3 right now.

48:42.560 --> 48:47.320
World badminton championships, enough said, but I like Brakeman's follow up.

48:47.320 --> 48:49.840
They could have at least called it the shuttlecock tournament.

48:49.840 --> 48:50.840
Nice.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.920
There you go.

48:52.920 --> 48:55.400
Chat.orangelaungerated.com if you want to chat with these folks.

48:55.400 --> 48:56.400
Shuttlecock.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.400
I know, right?

48:57.400 --> 49:01.280
Well how about something that has nothing to do with cocks?

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
Boring.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.280
Alright, no, we can do it.

49:03.280 --> 49:09.160
Well, there's been a call to ban Mafia 2 by the daughter of a Sicilian journalist who

49:09.160 --> 49:11.200
was murdered by the Mafia.

49:11.200 --> 49:14.160
Well, the journalist was murdered, of course not she was.

49:14.160 --> 49:16.360
Her name is Sonia Alfano.

49:16.360 --> 49:20.680
She is a member of the European Parliament and President of Italy's Association for the

49:20.680 --> 49:27.080
Family of Mafia Victims and I think she's, basically she's still grieving.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.400
You know, it happened in 93.

49:29.400 --> 49:34.680
Her father, Bepe, was murdered in January in 93.

49:34.680 --> 49:39.480
She's saying that basically it's taking the Mafia from, you know, killing and death into

49:39.480 --> 49:42.360
fun times.

49:42.360 --> 49:43.960
And 2K, I'm sorry, Take Two.

49:43.960 --> 49:46.360
It's that whole glamorizing violence thing.

49:46.360 --> 49:47.760
Yeah, that's it.

49:47.760 --> 49:51.640
And she's trying to get the European Commission to consider banning it.

49:51.640 --> 49:55.040
Take Two is like, uh, no.

49:55.040 --> 49:57.760
Basically it's dealing with the American Mafia.

49:57.760 --> 50:01.240
You know, sort of like the Godfather and Sopranos, that type of thing.

50:01.240 --> 50:04.520
And then they, you know, we're, you know, trying to make it sort of a more realistic

50:04.520 --> 50:09.320
type thing yet still be entertaining, not necessarily to glorify the violence in real

50:09.320 --> 50:18.160
life things, but to take the sort of, uh, fictional world of it.

50:18.160 --> 50:20.760
To take the fictional world of it, not necessarily glamorize it.

50:20.760 --> 50:24.000
Well, I, I, here's the funny thing.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.840
I do, obviously, I think this is a little bit too much.

50:27.840 --> 50:32.160
You don't ban an entire video game just because something unfortunate happened.

50:32.160 --> 50:35.160
And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to disrespect what happened.

50:35.160 --> 50:38.800
That's terrible that, you know, she lost her father in a crime like that so many years

50:38.800 --> 50:39.800
ago.

50:39.800 --> 50:44.320
I imagine that's something that you never get over, even though it's like 17 years later.

50:44.320 --> 50:48.700
However, it's letting one bad apple ruin the barrel, so to speak.

50:48.700 --> 50:53.640
At the same time, though, Take Two's argument of, well, it's not the European Mafia.

50:53.640 --> 50:55.240
It's the American Mafia.

50:55.240 --> 50:59.960
Okay, that's, that's, I don't think that's specifically their argument, just that they're

50:59.960 --> 51:04.400
saying that it set, you know, the whole Godfather Sopranos slash kind of thing.

51:04.400 --> 51:08.520
I, but I seriously don't think that makes it any better for this woman.

51:08.520 --> 51:13.120
However, if somebody's going to do something stupid, they're going to do something stupid.

51:13.120 --> 51:16.160
They don't need a video game to teach them how to do it.

51:16.160 --> 51:17.160
It's funny.

51:17.160 --> 51:20.320
I don't know why I'm reminded of this completely random conversation I was having last night

51:20.320 --> 51:25.560
on the train, but Alan and I took BART into the city to go to the Metronon to see Tron,

51:25.560 --> 51:26.560
right?

51:26.560 --> 51:29.780
And while we were going down into the BART tunnel, I was commenting, wow, I have, I have

51:29.780 --> 51:31.280
3G signal in here.

51:31.280 --> 51:33.880
I haven't had 3G signal in BART tunnel.

51:33.880 --> 51:34.880
I don't remember when.

51:34.880 --> 51:35.880
They must have put a tower down here, right?

51:35.880 --> 51:39.840
And he said, yeah, I think, I think they put a cell tower down in the BART stations a couple

51:39.840 --> 51:40.840
of years ago.

51:40.840 --> 51:43.880
You know, so people could still use their phone when they're down here.

51:43.880 --> 51:46.280
But it met with a lot of resistance for a while.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.280
They didn't want to put it in.

51:47.280 --> 51:49.400
I was like, oh, is that just San Francisco being hippies again?

51:49.400 --> 51:50.960
They don't want more cell towers.

51:50.960 --> 51:56.240
No, apparently it had to do with the fact that when the UK bombings happened back in

51:56.240 --> 52:02.760
oh, four, oh, five, sorry if I'm misstating that, but back when those happened, when those

52:02.760 --> 52:08.960
buses went off, that was all triggered via Internet and Wi-Fi or what have you, wireless

52:08.960 --> 52:09.960
signals.

52:09.960 --> 52:13.200
And so they didn't want something similar happening in the San Francisco BART tunnels.

52:13.200 --> 52:15.320
But I said, well, wait a minute.

52:15.320 --> 52:17.400
You know, obviously, you know, we're not arguing.

52:17.400 --> 52:19.360
He's just telling me the fact of the matter.

52:19.360 --> 52:24.620
But my response is, wait a minute, like, if somebody is going to do something stupid,

52:24.620 --> 52:28.840
they don't need 3G signal in order to be able to do it or not.

52:28.840 --> 52:33.440
Well, this is my thing, too, you know, like, my granddaddy died of cancer.

52:33.440 --> 52:37.320
I don't have a problem with house.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.320
Must be lupus.

52:39.320 --> 52:40.560
That's the only house joke I know.

52:40.560 --> 52:43.360
I don't even watch the show, but I know there's a joke about lupus.

52:43.360 --> 52:48.480
But they also, I've just picked something hospital related, so.

52:48.480 --> 52:49.480
Right.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.680
I don't have problems, okay.

52:51.680 --> 52:56.320
I don't have problems with people that smoke other than that they usually stink.

52:56.320 --> 52:59.760
But that's how my granddaddy got cancer.

52:59.760 --> 53:04.400
Here's the other thing I think this gal needs to take into consideration is that, you know,

53:04.400 --> 53:09.000
if she's upset about this Mafia video game, is she upset at the movie that comes out once

53:09.000 --> 53:15.760
every three months, at least, that also glamorizes the Mafia and the crime and all that stuff

53:15.760 --> 53:18.440
because there's an awful lot of movies.

53:18.440 --> 53:19.440
What about books?

53:19.440 --> 53:22.360
There's a lot of books.

53:22.360 --> 53:23.360
The Godfather was a book.

53:23.360 --> 53:26.240
Honestly, I think she's sensitive.

53:26.240 --> 53:27.240
She has a right to be sensitive.

53:27.240 --> 53:33.520
I understand she's sensitive, but at the same time, you don't take that out on everybody

53:33.520 --> 53:34.520
else.

53:34.520 --> 53:35.520
Yeah.

53:35.520 --> 53:41.000
You don't ban a game from an entire country because you have that whole response to it.

53:41.000 --> 53:45.640
I think that it's people taking their personal, you know, honestly, this goes back to one

53:45.640 --> 53:48.640
of the biggest things that I think is wrong with the world in general.

53:48.640 --> 53:56.040
It goes back to that, it's very selfish, I think, you know, and I'm not trying to belittle

53:56.040 --> 53:57.040
her grief.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.040
Exactly.

53:58.040 --> 54:05.000
But it's like, you know, especially with the whole political correctness thing, you know.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.800
People spend so many times because one or two people are offended for something, but

54:09.800 --> 54:12.520
not the entire population.

54:12.520 --> 54:13.520
You know?

54:13.520 --> 54:19.360
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeonshreddy.com, Frisbee says, remember, 3G and Wi-Fi didn't

54:19.360 --> 54:21.920
cause those buses to explode, explosives did.

54:21.920 --> 54:24.440
Yeah, that was kind of my point, too.

54:24.440 --> 54:29.560
Jvmon in our chatroom says, does that mean Facebook will be taking off Mafia wars?

54:29.560 --> 54:34.040
William Murderface says, is she mad at Jersey Shore for making Italians look like asses?

54:34.040 --> 54:38.160
That's a whole nother topic.

54:38.160 --> 54:42.280
This is my thing, okay, for example, and I actually get a lot of this living in California,

54:42.280 --> 54:44.720
I'm trying to pick something neutral and something light.

54:44.720 --> 54:50.000
I get the whole, oh, Alabama's full of rednecks thing, which I know for a fact it's not.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
I'm from there.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Am I a redneck?

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Well.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Rob.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.120
You do get awfully excited over Chick-fil-A.

54:56.120 --> 54:57.120
Oh, God.

54:57.120 --> 55:01.080
Well, Chick-fil-A's delicious, but I mean.

55:01.080 --> 55:02.080
I'm kidding, by the way.

55:02.080 --> 55:03.080
I know.

55:03.080 --> 55:04.080
I just wrote three emails down.

55:04.080 --> 55:05.080
It's fine.

55:05.080 --> 55:12.180
But I mean, you know, a lot of people in the South are uber conservative, bush-loving,

55:12.180 --> 55:15.200
you know, gun-toting rednecks.

55:15.200 --> 55:20.200
I mean, the stereotypes exist for a reason.

55:20.200 --> 55:24.320
However, I don't get offended because I know they're not talking about me.

55:24.320 --> 55:30.060
Now, if they said all people from Alabama are freakin' rednecks and all that, I'd be

55:30.060 --> 55:31.060
like, you know what?

55:31.060 --> 55:32.060
That's not true.

55:32.060 --> 55:38.360
allow me to educate you but you know weren't you raised by lesbians who live

55:38.360 --> 55:43.820
in Alabama yes not your mother but you know your your pseudo mothers for a

55:43.820 --> 55:46.940
couple years when you were out of high school right yes I was so and you know

55:46.940 --> 55:50.060
when I think of Alabama I don't think of that's the place where all the lesbians

55:50.060 --> 55:58.420
go I think of Santa Cruz but I'm saying that people and I understand the

55:58.420 --> 56:02.740
concept behind wanting to make things better for other people wanting to try

56:02.740 --> 56:08.340
to decrease opportunity for hate if that makes sense Rob mm-hmm but at the same

56:08.340 --> 56:15.180
time I think that people are a little too sensitive I really like this comment

56:15.180 --> 56:18.020
and I think this is a good one to end it on and move on to another story break

56:18.020 --> 56:21.980
man in our chat room says people have the right to their opinions but they

56:21.980 --> 56:26.780
don't have the right to enforce their opinions on others well said that's it

56:26.780 --> 56:30.500
chat I think the world just needs to be a little thicker skinned chat orange

56:30.500 --> 56:33.500
lounge radio.com or you can always email us if you have an opinion on that mail

56:33.500 --> 56:37.580
bag at orange lounge radio.com I'd actually be really curious about this

56:37.580 --> 56:41.700
and and this might be a dangerous place to go but that's okay we'll be a little

56:41.700 --> 56:47.300
bit dangerous here on olr I kind of want to know if there's a game out there that

56:47.300 --> 56:53.900
has ever made someone like that has ever kind of offended someone in this similar

56:53.900 --> 56:56.540
type of manner and I'm not necessarily like I don't I don't want to hear you're

56:56.540 --> 56:59.900
really like you know upsetting story about something that happened in the

56:59.900 --> 57:02.260
family or whatever but is there have been something in a video game where you

57:02.260 --> 57:06.220
were just kind of like you know what they really shouldn't have done that I'm

57:06.220 --> 57:09.500
just kind of curious if people can think of a case like that and email it to us

57:09.500 --> 57:13.140
mailbag at orange lounge radio.com there's a world war two games and you're out there killing Nazis

57:13.140 --> 57:18.220
mm-hmm and yeah everything they did was really crappy but that's the past we

57:18.220 --> 57:24.140
learned from it mm-hmm we move forward mm-hmm you know and I mean I'm saying

57:24.140 --> 57:27.180
that now we should you know know what the warning signs are know what to stop

57:27.180 --> 57:32.460
you know there should be no legislation that forces you know one you know person

57:32.460 --> 57:36.860
you know it's something different when it's a something that's beyond your

57:36.860 --> 57:42.220
control you know now that now that we can learn from history I think that

57:42.220 --> 57:45.380
that's one thing but I think that people do need to understand that there's just

57:45.380 --> 57:50.940
assholes in the world and people are haters gonna hate right exactly it's my

57:50.940 --> 57:54.900
favorite just gotta just gotta be a little bit better than them but you know

57:54.900 --> 57:58.220
ready to put the stop when it actually is something that you can do something

57:58.220 --> 58:04.260
about you can't change minds you can't change the way people feel but you can

58:04.260 --> 58:10.420
change how you respond to it all right it's some kind of a comment here along

58:10.420 --> 58:14.160
those lines from Derek H in our chat room says I did not like the airport

58:14.160 --> 58:17.160
scene in Call of Duty 4 at all I thought it was really fucked up and had no

58:17.160 --> 58:22.260
reason being there chat dot orange roger dot com or a mailbag may I was really

58:22.260 --> 58:28.660

58:38.260 --> 58:45.860
iPod um close-knit deathmatch locations and not the big old expansive open-world

58:45.860 --> 58:50.300

online shouldn't say no sure I don't know if this is the first expansion for

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:45.340
Nobunaga I know they have Nobunaga's like they turn Nobunaga's ambition into

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.540
like an online game now so I'm not sure if this is the online game itself I

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.920
thought that had already come out or if this is like the first expansion but

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.780
that is coming out in Japan on the 22nd unfortunately the description is in

01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:00.900
Japanese so I can't read if that's a regular one or expansion also coming out

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:07.620
on the 23rd of December Mugen Cairo Hikari tokage no hako comes out as well

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.140
like it's it looks like echo chrome but with colors and sure enough it is echo

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.780

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:31.700

Momochan diet we figure o bix by John Dion comes out this week on the 23rd

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:42.260
yeah it's another diet game but get this you have to see the box art for this

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:46.980
game I'm just gonna copy that little picture and I'm gonna post that in our

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:51.320
chat room and you kids tell me if you're gonna buy that fitness game based on the

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.540
artwork or not Loki what do you think what is this fitness game have in the

01:01:55.540 --> 01:02:00.540
box art that most fitness games don't usually have hot Asian chick on the

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:04.500
front that's right in a bikini nonetheless and she's not only in a

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:09.340
bikini she's kind of peeling down the bottom of her bikini yeah you know what

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:13.540
what a hoe Jillian Michaels tried that on the cover her game and I'm sorry not

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:21.860
the same effect it's not the same like no I don't want to see your penis it is

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:28.700
not this is not the same all right also milestone shooting collection 2 comes

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.860
out on the way but who cares you're all going to be looking at your unopened

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:39.300
boxes of Momochan diet on the DS not a lot this week there really isn't

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:44.700
anything but we do get to saga three she could know Hasha shadow or light comes

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:50.260
out on January 6 I believe this is another game in the saga series like

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:55.100
it's a remake of one of the saga games which was what Final Fantasy legend here

01:02:55.100 --> 01:03:01.780
so that's kind of cool lastly going to the PSP beyond the Milky Way comes out

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:05.980
this week on the PSP as well as starry sky in autumn and a big release this

parasite Eve game coming on PSP the third birthday this week so there'll be

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.460
a lot of folks importing that one that's probably the biggest release of them all

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:54.180
for the release dates this week let's go back into some news and we have the

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.540
classic game of the week just a few minutes ahead of us but first a story

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:05.620
from Loki yes let's see this is kind of neat now you may remember that they just

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:13.660
released the pretty awesome infinity blade on the iPhone and iOS App Store

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:17.780
well there's gonna be other games supporting the unreal development kit

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:25.220
and it's kind of cool one of the demos that they're showing off the unreal

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:31.300
development kit for was none other than the long hopefully not forgotten epic

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:39.980
game just jackrabbit but now updated in 3d graphics and fun stuff like that

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:46.460
there's actually some other epic whatever unreal engine games that are

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:49.660
coming to the store in fact I think there's actually one and I don't

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:54.180
remember what it was called but it was I kind of looked a little bit like World

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:59.620
of Warcraft on but it was like a tower defense game or something like that

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.620
we're like a hack and slash game with the name dungeon in the title I don't

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:11.020
remember exactly what it was but it looked pretty cool so but yeah I mean

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:17.020
more games supporting the unreal engine would be pretty awesome because they can

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:21.740
do some pretty sweet looking stuff just even up with the limited resources of

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:27.500
the iOS and the iPhones and stuff like that just like when I hear that there

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:31.260
might be a new jazz jackrabbit or whatever I'm like oh my god is it 1994

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:38.260
this is great yeah that's awesome something else that is new and exciting

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.500
I guess depends what kind of games you play sing star yeah I remember seeing

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:47.700
star the karaoke games it's also a dance game I played your Abba yeah sing star

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:51.100
you shouldn't tell everybody on the internet I have that but I told oh come

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:56.100
on you said that was your reason for getting a ps3 it was I need to get sing

01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:00.340
star Queen but here's some other exciting stuff about sing star the sing

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:05.020
star store is set to explode if you live in the u.s. here's the thing sing star is

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:09.260
actually really big in Europe it's much bigger in Europe than it is here and

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:12.220
there's lots and lots of downloadable songs that go to Europe but they don't

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.540
come over to the u.s. but here's the deal there's been a new deal made between

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:22.420
Sony and Universal Music meaning that the content that goes to Europe will now

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:28.700
be coming to the u.s. as well and it all started this week 64 new songs hit the

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:33.860
u.s. sing star store 11 of them tracks for seeing star dance these tracks cost

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:37.780
about a buck 50 each I'm trying to see if there's any like really really big

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:41.500
songs and here there's a shit ton of Lady Gaga songs so if you're into Lady

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.820

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.580
romance because you know you want to make your friend sing bad romance songs

take on me I'm sorry I still like the birthday massacre version better

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:30.240
whatever there it is some sing star stuff for you hey let's go to the

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:36.380
classics video games and talk about an old-school game the dark soccer thinks

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:41.020
hey you kids ought to be playing this week the classic video game of the week

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:46.140
dark soccer is gonna step into the vault find a game that she says hey you got

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:51.380
two weeks cuz the holiday play this game damn it what's classic game of the week

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:55.980
I can tell you people are gonna have a hard time finding this one space fantasy

01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:03.060
zone space fantasy zone yes not fantasy zone but space fantasy zone basically

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:10.980
what this game is is that it is a mix of space Harrier and fantasy zone and even

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:18.140
the music is a little remix of the things it actually with with the

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:23.140
particular game it never came out it was never released this is a prototype oh

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:32.900
wait a minute however however um you actually can find the the disk image

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.980
online aha so the kiddies are gonna have to resort to more scandalous means to

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:41.340
play this game I wouldn't necessarily say it's scandalous given that you know

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:49.700
I don't really think there's any kind of restriction on it but it is really

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:55.100
pretty it's still got the same kind of space Harrier scaling issues it's pretty

01:08:55.100 --> 01:09:00.020
minimalist but the other thing that actually I didn't really care for it too

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:04.220
is that it is a little bit harder to hit stuff but it's still so freaking cute I

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:08.140
mean because the game space Harrier is set in the fantasy zone you know welcome

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:12.300
to fancy zone get ready so it takes two of the best things and just puts them

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:17.700
together and you know your bosses are your you know some of your classic

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:27.260
fantasy zone bosses it's just really neat and it's cute it really is just

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:32.060
it's something for people who love space Harrier or fantasy zone I mean that was

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:37.420
really all that it is it's it's eye candy oh and you can go into your

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:43.700
little shops and buy stuff you've got the same you know lady from your from

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:48.700
the shops and fantasy zone and get all kinds of goodies it's just cute I mean

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:53.700
that's really all I can say about it and it's got the oppa oppa and his little

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:59.700
feet sticking out going that's really it that's really all I can say about it

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.540
this is a prototype it never really came out that's alright it's especially it's

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:08.420
a special game for the holidays exactly and like I said you can you can find it

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:15.740
online you know if you've got a week we've played it I mean I'm gonna link

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.000
people here in the chat room to the little youtubes they can kind of see

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.340
what this game looks like because it is key I mean it's exactly what you said

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:25.020
it's space Harrier with fantasy zone graphics it's pretty cute and I figured

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:28.420
since fantasy zone is my second favorite game is space Harrier is my third

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:33.460
favorite game I have to throw the two together but you know oddly enough I

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:38.020
wouldn't exactly I don't really classify space fantasy zone on so let's see the

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.900
other reason why I'm ringing it up for the classic game is that it is you can

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:47.980
play the whole thing it's fun it's it's you know a nice waste of time not there

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.940
usually are a few issues with the disc 2 and burning so you have to be really

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:57.060
careful when you do it but it's like see there's the wood face thing yeah I like

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:01.660
how the bosses in this game kind of look like the bosses from the original

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:04.900
fantasy they are the bosses yeah you know what I mean though they're in that

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:10.140
whole 3d environment so kind of neat so I really had to had to just throw it out

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:15.820
there you know it's a game that I think any fan of fantasy zone and space

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:20.780
Harrier should at least give a look at now there's some listeners that aren't

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.860
gonna know so I have to ask you just said your second favorite game ever is

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:27.540
fantasy zone and your third favorite ever is space Harrier what's number one

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:32.420
that would be the Guardian legend amen sister the Guardian legend most

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:37.460
underrated NES game ever the game is so great great absolutely astounding it's

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.540
not as good any of those games as Super Metroid but they're all still really

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:46.300
good well that's your favorite game I know but I mean so really I know it's

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.740
not an official released game and yeah I've got a few prototypes of other stuff

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:56.260
but this is one prototype that you can get the full version of out there it's

01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:01.060
not unavailable mm-hmm you know now you can't find an official printing of it or

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.900
something without spending the bucks right but still and you know there's no

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.620
I don't think there's any real reason about why it wasn't released it might

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:13.580
have been something about licensing issues mm-hmm but it's just fun and I

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:18.620
mean it's not even really the greatest game ever but it is something that uh

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:23.020
that's worth playing it's something that's worth checking out and at least

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:30.500
you know watch the video it's cute all right and I I still love the PC engine

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.760

each day and then like I can mark things a little post-it notes like e3 and some

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.660
of the big events during the years I can see how long it is till e3 when I was

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:14.220
working I actually had three different calendars like that on my desk I had the

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:19.740
redneck dictionary which I just thought was funny and then I had the Yiddish

tiny and not family guy because this has quotes on it I can actually put on my my

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:53.940

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:46.060
about rebroadcast something else off chat with him offline about anyhow let's

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:51.660
get into some rapid-fire news some quick news stories that we just don't have the

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.540
full time to talk about we want to bring him to your attention on the last lucky

01:18:54.540 --> 01:19:01.460
yes so this is neat super meat boy game we've actually been talking about on the

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:05.700
show for a few weeks now and is very awesome if you happen to have the PC

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:11.500
version apparently they figured out a way to uncover the dev mode located in

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:17.500
the game and of course it was discovered by the modding community and I believe

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:24.100
it allows you to customize your game a little bit of course this is only in the

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:28.980
PC version it gives you the keys to the kingdom as they put it and some very

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:34.380
user-friendly tools in which a team meet created the game with including the

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:40.380
original batch of levels and actually is kinda cool team meet the creators of the

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:44.100
game are actually nice enough to post a few tutorial videos explaining how to

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:49.780
access and use the tools until the you know finally get around to making a

01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:55.100
proper level creator but that's pretty awesome that you know someone figured

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:59.060
out where the dev mode is and they went ahead and decided hey you know what we're

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.420
just gonna go ahead and instead of saying no why did you do that we're

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:06.940
gonna help people out and see how people get creative with it so that's really

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:11.660
sweet and of course if you're a fan of dead rising to you'll be happy to know

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:17.780
that on December 27th dead rising to case west will be coming out on xbox

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:25.820
live arcade it's the exclusive epilogue to the game and will cost you a hundred

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:31.540
microsoft points or ten dollars do want so that looks pretty awesome and of

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:34.820
course they're also going to have you know the photo part of the game coming

01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:42.940
back as well for that is so nice little after Christmas gift there and then

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:46.980
finally section 8 which was a first-person shooter came out last

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:55.260
August or I should say August 09 that actually did ok retail and was a full

01:20:55.260 --> 01:21:00.380
price game when it came out but now for the sequel prejudice they've decided hey

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:04.060
instead of you know charging $60 for a game we're just gonna actually put it

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:09.820
out on xbox live arcade in the PlayStation Network as well as PC for

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:14.580
only $15 so that's pretty awesome that they went ahead and they're gonna put

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:19.700
out full game for the $15 and it's gonna also include a single-player campaign

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:24.900
support for up to 32 players and online multiplayer and a new four-player co-op

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:29.380
mode called swarm says offline players will also be able to partake in

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:37.380
multiplayer as the game can add bots in case you don't have your friends or

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:40.380
internet connection to play against

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:48.340
cool and what they're saying I think the way they're going to come about making

01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:51.100
up some of the money they would have made from a retail version is they're

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:55.540
gonna have this substantial download content so that's pretty substantial

01:21:55.540 --> 01:22:00.220
download content as opposed to like just a little bit yes

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:05.820
alright this is a very interesting game coming to the iPad iPhone and the

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:11.900
Macintosh it's called Hamlet the game yes that's right and Hamlet's taking out

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:17.860
the trash only it's not really is that Hamlet 2 no that was from last action

01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:24.220
hero oh I should be or not to be I've got to be have you seen Hamlet 2 no it's

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:29.300
the dumbest fucking movie is there still kids here I'm hoping not as the doors

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:33.240
wide open is there still kids here I don't think so okay good it's the

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:38.300
dumbest fucking movie ever made but it's it's like so dumb it's kind of funny so

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.220
anyway I was able to but this actually is not really what you would think it

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.780
is in fact there's a whole little trailer out there for the game and I

01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:49.180
kind of like it's very like stylized I like that style it's a kind of like that

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:56.460
limbo esque thing going on there yeah it's all coming out January 2011 I'm

01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:01.460
playing the trailer here in studio it's an adventure game this does not look

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:09.580
like Hamlet to play to me but it is based on Shakespeare's Hamlet so I have

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:15.940
no idea how that works see now we need the disaster gay friend to show up what

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:20.940
you're doing what what are you doing I know right apparently the rest of the

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:27.940
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 roster has been revealed it's spoiled that is if you

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:33.940
believe the dirty internet rumors Cienko from Darkstalkers sweet Akuma from

01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:38.820
Street Fighter Haggar from Final Fight really yes that's awesome actually

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:47.500
Phoenix the x-men sentinel from the x-men taskmaster Avengers ish Galactus

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:53.500
is the final boss in the fight fantastic for taskmasters be interesting so there

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.700
you go apparently some other characters that were planned for the game but they

01:23:56.700 --> 01:24:02.900
didn't make it Phoenix Wright Megaman venom and Frank West were all planned

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:07.660
for the game but it just didn't happen I'm kind of sad that Frank West won't

01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:10.180
show up that's kind of surprising but then again he's not the central

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:14.500
character in the new game so I don't know it would have been an easy port

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:18.500
since I you know totsunoko vs. Capcom had him but you would think right

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:27.300
taskmaster taskmaster actually makes sense because he was a regular in a dead

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:34.740
in the old older Deadpool comic for a while right well hey if you like RPGs and

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:40.260
you own a PSP and you like when I say RPGs I mean like old-school RPGs then

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:44.580
like seriously like there is an awesome incredible must-have game that was

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:48.140
announced for the PSP this week it's going to be so awesome I can't wait like

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:51.460
like get the dust off the PSP break them out

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:58.020
Squeenix has announced that they are bringing Final Fantasy 4 to the PSP and

01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:04.580
this is not the 3d version that was on the DS but it's being redone in 2d

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:11.100
with the graphics in HD allah the Final Fantasy 1 & 2 remakes but here's the

01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:17.460
thing it's not just Final Fantasy 4 it's also the after years on one disc that

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:51.180
anyway we'll read it anyway Sony and polyphony digital are going to be doing

01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:55.660
a competition around Gran Turismo 5 they're partnering with Nissan it's a

01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:59.660
multi-phase gaming event it's going to be on the speed network in 2011 the

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:04.060
competition itself already began on December 15th you use a pre-selected

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:07.660
Nissan vehicle and Gran Turismo 5 earning free digital content for

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:12.720

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:51.300
topics if you want to send us a tweet twitter.com slash o-l-r moving on to some

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:57.500
other news Loki yes we were talking a little bit about the inclusion of the

01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:01.580
unreal development kit for iOS well one of the first games to take advantage of

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:08.780
that was Infinity Blade and if any blade did pretty well with its launch it made

01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:14.220
1.7 million dollars in four days and that's pretty good for being a six

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:20.300
dollar game they sold it over two hundred and eighty six thousand times and

01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:28.340
it's the fastest-grossing app ever according to the website app moto wow

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:34.220
the old record I guess was held by cut the rope which was 1 million dollars in

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:38.180
10 days I didn't realize cut the rope had caught on so quickly I thought cut

01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:40.180
the right I mean I've heard of cut the rope but I thought it was one of I've

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:43.980
never played it though but I thought it was one of those games that kind of

01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:48.300
slowly grew and popular and actually I could stand to correct it apparently

01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:54.460
epic Mark rain he said that the game center numbers are being reported are

01:33:54.460 --> 01:34:00.980
quite a bit lower than the actual sales so more than 1.7 million hmm says the

01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:05.300
says I tweeted because I thought that it'd be obvious that the game center

01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:09.900
numbers are a subset of our overall sales and not the actual number but

01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:14.260
several of the reports I saw seem to be confused about that also infinity blade

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:19.460
does not require game center you can choose to cancel and still play the game

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:24.380
however I recommend signing up for game center Apple has done a great job yeah

01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:28.540
right I'm sorry that's where I lost him right there did you hear speaking of

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:32.460
like failed Apple launches did you hear ping got some new additions in the last

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:36.180
week remember paying huh well you know what ping is no whatever first off

01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:40.140
whatever happened to pooping there was that website one of our listeners made

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:47.180
the pooping site but anyway no ping has now you can share playlists with your

01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:52.380
friends you can share playlists of songs that you know you could go and then buy

01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:57.300
on iTunes hey that's finally it's finally a feature of paying the Twitter

01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:02.020
doesn't have however insignificant it may be

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:08.380
so you know other fun stuff infinity blades getting an update next week

01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:12.940
they're gonna be adding some new enemies to face because I think from what I

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:19.180
heard there's only like six that you face each time play through the game and

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:24.300
they're also going to be adding multiplayer soon which is pretty

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:31.180
awesome and also five new weapons five new shields five new helmets a new armor

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:36.940
set enough equipment to increase the level cap to 45 and then of course the

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:43.540
new enemy type called the morrow fiend or marrow fiend and that's screenshots

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:48.500
from a frickin iPhone yes it is Alex outstanding I have not I will have to

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:52.140
show it to you you at some point we're not trying to do a radio show I'm in

01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:56.740
later I know I know I know all right during our music break after the show

01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:04.460
alright sounds good let's talk about sex now that I have your attention let's

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:10.180
talk about this new thing that's on the thingy it's on the connect yeah here's

01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:14.380
the deal we were talking earlier about connect tax and you know you people can

01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:19.540
play the piano and and people can do you know whatever these 3d dancing and all

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:22.380
these sorts of things that connect well it didn't take long for somebody to

01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:31.100
think of sex and it's from tricks with three X's that's tricks tricks they have

01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:36.820
built a connect based interface for a sex video game you slide your hands

01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:41.660
across computer-generated tits and computer-generated ass that's really all

01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:45.940
there is right now there's just a little floaty hand that is your hand that gets

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:51.980
to rub some fake boobies the Kinect hardware is used plus some of the open

01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:57.420
drivers in Windows 7 is how it works and unfortunately I would play the video for

01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:01.140
you but it was removed from YouTube because some people reported it for

01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:06.500
nudity and sexual content boo ruining all our fun boo it's just like all the

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:10.700
other sex games that they have out there like all the anime ones stuff where you

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:14.060
use the mouse and stuff instead of using the mouse use your hand it's honestly

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:19.540
not that exciting people it is not it's it's pretty much exactly what we said

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:25.620
you rub this magical floaty hand over boobs and the chick goes you know boobs

01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:31.420
anyway you might be wondering when this is coming out for the Xbox 360 really

01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:35.860
you're really wondering that here's the thing Microsoft is pretty much said hell

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:41.420
no in an interview with IGN they said quote Xbox is a family-friendly games and

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:45.500
entertainment console and does not allow adults only content to be certified for

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:49.460
use on its platform and would not condone this type of game for Kinect hold

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:56.460
on hold on stop right there really IGN really you went and asked them like it

01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:00.620
was a completely obvious to begin with that this was a first off never going to

01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:05.020
come out on a console be it was just a PC game anyways and see it wasn't that

01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:09.540
interesting of an idea but no you have the spare time to go ask them this so

01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:14.660
you can get a comment so that you can get some more pages good job I agree but

01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:17.820
at the same time maybe you should dedicate a podcast to that too because

01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:22.860
they have like 80,000 podcast it's kind of bullshit because you know and I'm

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:27.540
probably preaching to the choir here but if somebody really wants to waste $60 on

01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:33.340
this then you know what let them you know how is this any worse than some of

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:36.780
the bang-bang shoot-em-up games that are out there like I don't know mafia 2 that

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:40.780
was brought up earlier in the show all right I'm so double standard of sex

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:43.900
versus there is a double standard and I bet you anything this will come out in

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:48.660
Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 3 where they will have it where you can

01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:54.140
tickle them with yes it's just tickling and it's just a giant feather that's in

01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:57.220
your hand it's not actually your hand but it's a giant feather and you can go

01:38:57.220 --> 01:39:01.900
tickle tickle tickle tickle and they'll go hee hee hee and their boobs will move yeah but that'll be okay

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:06.020
that'll be all right DarkSakura would you play Dead or Alive if it had a booby

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:15.100
tickling connect mode yes you should be able to unlock them I think that I think

01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:18.340
that they should have the dudes in the game

01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:24.580
ok this is the thing boobs are a lot more fun than junk like for bounciness

01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:34.820
ok I'll with you on that so why don't they have one with dudes and speedos and

01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:39.220
everything I'm surprised they don't have like a beach you know beach where mode

01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:44.540
in like Dead or Alive you know wasn't there the whole volleyball game but I'm

01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:49.820
talking about like actual fighting you know I don't know how I feel about this

01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:55.380
chat dot orange laundry dot com longs got I don't know in our chat room says

01:39:55.380 --> 01:40:00.220
poop should be cool in video games no I don't think that's ever really cool like

01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:04.940
some things you know again if that's what somebody really wants to pay 60

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:11.940
bucks on his poop the game then you know what I mean you can poop for free like

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:16.340
every day just eat more fiber you know but tickling chicks with feathers that

01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:20.740
one that's not every day unless you're a rockstar PC indie game where you had the

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:42.780
poop don't shit your pants anything is possible on the PC and that's what

01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:47.860
that's why folks PC gaming will never cease to exist in you think that poop is

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:52.900
not in games yet or at least not enough in games just wait Duke Nukem forever

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:58.060
hasn't come out yet so I'm sure there'll be plenty of poop in that I love this

01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:02.060
oh my god is the best constant comment ever and I can't pronounce this name

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:09.540
kassan khan khan with an s says too long so god about his old poop thing fiber

01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:17.940
uppercut you win you win chatter of the evening right there sound the bells and

01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:24.180
whistles be me me dude whose name I can't pronounce kassen kassen congrats

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:35.380
fiber uppercut you win alrighty hell only on orange launch radio maybe we

01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:38.460
could get away from the sex topic for a minute here dark Sakura do you have

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:42.300
something maybe a little more legitimate for us shadow the hedgehog

01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:50.660
barf barf barf barf serious yeah well basically Sega wanted to describe what

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:55.420
when it is talk about why we got shadow the hedgehog they thought it would work

01:41:55.420 --> 01:42:03.380
for US gamers the producer of sonic colors Takashi Iizuka said after Sonic

01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:08.380
adventure we had two studios when the US one in Japan and to continue the quote

01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:11.780
Japanese studio was to develop a sonic game in the standard style in the US was

01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:14.380
to develop something different which could contribute to the sonic franchise

01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:21.180
so basically he was made to work in the US because first and third person

01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:24.700
shooters were popular and they wanted someone who could work with it hence we

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:31.140
got you know shadow the gangsta hedgehog so but what they'd have to realize is

01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:38.860
that we like sonic because it's not standard american fair file this under

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:46.900
the Americans are so stupid been more like don't try to estimate what a

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.340
completely different cultures going to like why is it that like every time

01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:55.300
there's a game is like targeted at America it usually like really stinks I

01:42:55.300 --> 01:43:00.540
don't know maybe I'm just doing an overall broad it was a cool character

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:05.460
really well-designed but other than that the concept was just crap it had

01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:10.020
potential I mean it was you know signed a hedgehog guns I mean how do you make

01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:17.780
things better yet guns to it or boobs you know or both but somehow they just

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:21.260
said you know what instead of making it run fast and stuff we're just gonna make

01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:29.060
him have guns colors gonna be so much nicer I'm looking forward already I was

01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:33.620
there but I can't afford it right now there is a game that was like targeted

01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:38.540
for the u.s. or whatever that wasn't that bad secret of evermore was horribly

01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:42.740
underrated like it actually was a good game yeah I had that I had the super

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:45.900
news I probably still have the Super Nintendo Kart in a bin somewhere but

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:51.300
yeah that was not as terrible as people made it out to me I mean it was no second

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:55.820
to set so three but it was good in its own way and wasn't that the first game

01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:59.020
that what's his name the guy who does all the music for like Guild Wars and

01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:03.380
oblivion Jeremy's soul so they he did that was like his first soundtrack I

01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:09.300
think was secret evermore so I guess it's rare but it does happen occasionally

01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:21.820
let's move on yes now I'm gonna try to report this without sounding hateful

01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:30.980
try not very hard great use a low-key rants and I'm just saying graders both

01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:35.780
eyes creator wants to add monthly updates that that's fine that that's

01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:43.140
cool plans premium car upgrades later on stuff like that so basically they're

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:47.140
saying that they don't consider their work complete yet really you think that

01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:52.380
game wasn't rushed to market because it's been you know in development for

01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:57.940
years now and they really need to get it out this year because the lane again

01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:02.820
people just kind of roll their eyes at them but you know there's only about

01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:07.620
fifth of the vehicles that represent in the game right now with premium models

01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:11.620
which feature higher resolution textures yes that's right some of the good models

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:16.260
in the game are quite as finished as others but don't worry they're going to

01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:24.580
be adding patches later on to add some new items including new premium cars

01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:29.100
available for download and they haven't said yet whether those updates will be

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:35.900
free great so you could pay or possibly pay more for more of your game that you

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:40.540
purchase that isn't quite done yet but don't worry they'll finish it someday

01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:48.820
and they'll call it Gran Turismo 6 when do you think do you think Gran Turismo 6 is

01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:51.020
going to come out for the ps3 or do you think we're gonna wait for the next

01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:56.740
system next console yeah what about that whole 10-year life cycle thing we're

01:45:56.740 --> 01:46:00.140
only what four years old don't worry Gran Turismo 6 prologue will be coming

01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:05.020
out you know and it'll be totally like the game was I mean man that's guys well

01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:07.940
I don't know if it's got a suck for the people that bought prologue I mean I

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:12.580
think that's a dumb idea to buy the game anyways the prologue cuz what's the

01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:18.180
point nearly paying for a demo basically oh no no it's a full-featured game with

01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:24.780
like new very few cars but all right well oh sorry and no it's on demo all

01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:28.220
right coming also to the PlayStation 3 very soon and a lot of people are

01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:31.820
excited about this even though this game was already out some time ago Mass

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.940
Effect 2 is coming out to the PlayStation 3 but there's some you know

01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:38.540
some tweaks and some upgrades and some new things Mass Effect 3 of course is

01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:42.460
coming out in 2011 but you of course have this whole weird thing going on

01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:47.380
where Mass Effect 2 is coming out on the PlayStation 3 but Mass Effect 1 never

01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:52.140
came out so if I don't own an Xbox how do I get that experience of Mass Effect

01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:56.740
1 well they've figured it out there's an interactive comic that's gonna come with

01:46:56.740 --> 01:47:01.820
Mass Effect 2 called Mass Effect Genesis and what it does is it kind of is a

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:06.500
really quick like play I don't say it's a playthrough because it's a comic but

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:13.020
it's a real quick summary I guess of the 360 and the PC game Mass Effect 1 but

01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:17.820
you also get to actually do some things in this comic that you did in the

01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:22.900
original game you get to make they're saying six decisions that you made in

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:26.860
Mass Effect 1 that will now impact your Mass Effect 2 game I hope one of those

01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:31.140
decisions is making sweet sweet love to the alien chick yes it wasn't the whole

01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:35.580
lesbian thing in Mass Effect 1 that that hopefully that is one decision but I'm

01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:38.660
not gonna hold my breath but yeah apparently you will get to make some of

01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:42.060
the decisions and have your game impacted just like you could play Mass

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:46.660
Effect 1 and have your game get impacted in Mass Effect 2 so that's kind of neat

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:54.820
so a PlayStation 3 gamer will get to start the game do the opening sequence

01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:57.780
and then they're gonna go into this comic that I guess will then impact the

01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:04.660
game later on so that's kind of cool I like that so that again that is coming

01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:09.140
out in January Mass Effect 1 they are saying is not gonna come out for the

01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:12.460
PlayStation 3 because they're gonna move on to Mass Effect 3 so this is as close

01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:15.540
as you're ever gonna get unless you happen to own a PC which you probably do

01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:19.620
if you're listening to show and you can go play Mass Effect 1 I don't know if

01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:26.620
Mac has Mass Effect 1 if it is if it does it's probably on Steam there you go

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:32.300
we're gonna go now to the mailbag where folks can send us emails at mailbag at

01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:37.860
orange lounge radio.com and every week we read your emails live here on air and

01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:46.500
respond to them mailbag at orange lounge radio.com two emails first one hi

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:51.620
everyone I have a question that can possibly that can possibly answered I

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:57.940
mean that should be be answered by the OLR gang and chat room I'm an avid

01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:01.140
knitter and I'm looking for a video game character garments that look like they

01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:04.580
were knitted the only two examples I can think of are Riku's scarf from Final

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:11.660
Fantasy 10 2 and Nora S. Theum sweater slash vest in Final Fantasy 13 pictures

01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:16.100
attached I've got no problems no projects going on and I'm waiting to

01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:20.240
start Nora's sweater slash vest as soon as I get patterns from someone to make

01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:23.300
them up for me because I don't know anything about sewing and patterns

01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:27.980
thanks so much Stan PS last time I wrote in I was telling you about how a friend

01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:31.520
said I wasn't a gamer because I didn't like certain games well I confronted him

01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.900
and we're cool now in fact the other friend was with us when I brought it up

01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:37.740
and made them both listen to that episode of your show and now he's a fan

01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:42.300
did I already share this I didn't know oh well I don't think so that's kind of

01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:45.580
cool that's really awesome that we can like make fun of your friend and he's

01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:50.720
still a fan of the show awesome I'm checking out this oh yeah yeah you're

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:55.740
into the whole knitting thing wouldn't I crochet Rob oh I always get the two

01:49:55.740 --> 01:50:02.140
confused yeah knitting I think you can do more with knitting but I I don't have

01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:06.160
the coordination for it now when it when I tried to learn again it really made my

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:09.620
hand hurt I mean crochet will do it to me after a while because I finished a

01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:12.940
hat for Becky that was really yeah but you got that whole trigger finger thing

01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:16.660
still don't you like you know residual stuff from when that was really

01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:20.420
bothering you well I'm sure there's also characters that wear hats um yeah I

01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:23.020
would think like a lot of like I don't know I for some reason I think of the

01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:27.260
Zelda world I also think of a game you should look up as eternal Sonata like I

01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:30.300
don't know if there was a lot but I don't know why I just think of that game

01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:33.820
but something that could be like a creative idea like if you're really

01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:37.180
looking for projects that you know I kind of see these things online once in

01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:40.740
a while and I always thought they were kind of cool like look up 8-bit sprites

01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:45.780
and there's a lot of websites around that have like 8-bit 8-bit right

01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:49.900
repositories needle craft really cuz I was gonna say you could do I mean but

01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:53.380
still it kind of gives you an idea like how to knit like if you want to make

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:58.140
like a blanket or some other type of throw or something I can't believe I'm

01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:02.620
actually talking about knitting you can get some ideas for patterns from like

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:06.460
old-school 8-bit sprites I would think I mean not gonna get clothes patterns but

01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:12.820
I have to sit and draw it but I did have a plan for a much later project of

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:18.700
crocheting a Tetris blanket oh that's fun I'd crochet it actually in the blocks

01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:26.100
and then attach the box with yarn but I right now I don't have the time or

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:29.840
patience for it what about like a pillow front thing or is that more of a needle

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:36.420
point you could crochet a sham hmm but but as far as like actual clothing

01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:40.260
gosh nothing really comes to mind for me I think the best place to go would be

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:43.620
RPGs and I don't know why but I'm thinking of the characters from eternal

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:49.180
sonata like I've seen one that had a lot of knitting type stuff I don't know I

01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:53.980
don't know does Dan know the Dan do you know video game characters that wear

01:51:53.980 --> 01:52:00.660
knitted outfits did he give you the face what he just gave me this face of shit

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:10.660
no no Rob I don't earthbound that's that's Ness's sweat oh my gosh knitting

01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:15.220
advice from Dan Ness's sweater could very well be knitted what a wonderful

01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:21.140
idea who would have thought this Freddy Krueger hey dude I'm on the street that

01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:27.060
was a game all right dad goes that Dan goes a really bad game now did he send

01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:31.260
pictures of his projects cuz I'm seeing pictures of the characters okay well we

01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:36.300
need to see pictures of your work so we'll be awaiting those pictures that's

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:41.940
a really see I think in a lot of games don't have that level of detail in the

01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:45.420
character design like you know that picture from Final Fantasy 3 of one of

01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:51.360
the characters is so high-def and so detailed I think you kind of have to go

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:55.460
to old-school video games that quote use your imagination a little more because

01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:58.780
you can't ever see the detail of clothes in a lot of games to know if they were

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:07.220
knitted or not you know well last email hey guys hey for festivals slash

01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:11.020
December wien one of my friends gifted me with her PlayStation 2 which she no

01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:15.780
longer uses nice gift this extremely this is extremely awesome considering

01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:20.940
that one of my evil exes took my old ps2 the downside is that the only ps2 game I

01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:24.820
still own his Final Fantasy 10 how about helping me to rebuild my ps2 library by

01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:27.220
suggesting a few good games for me to buy thanks

01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:33.340
tiara ps I'm gonna rob I want to be on hardhouse 11d I wanted her on last week

01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:37.540
but it didn't work out so I'll talk to you offline tiara we do want to have you

01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:42.620
on as a guest so maybe next week we got to find a Thursday that you're free but

01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:48.900
anyway ps2 games ps2 games I silent any of the silent Hills absolutely no games

01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:54.340
actually I would say get Silent Hill 2 & 3 if tiara owns Final Fantasy 10

01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:59.300
then I'm gonna I'm gonna guess that she's a roleplay game type fan so

01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:03.580
definitely 10 to 12 was horrifically underrated because it came out right

01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:09.500
with the news yeah that's a good one I think the dot hack games were always

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:13.220
really underrated it's that whole simulated MMO thing but they're a little

01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:16.740
more action II I think those are really good to look into I can't remember the

01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:21.580
name of the first one it's dot hack volume one infection thank you Dan

01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:27.740
Daniels magic pen gel was an underlooked RPG game that's where you could draw

01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:31.100
wieners and then they could go into battle and stuff we had a lot of fun on

01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:35.500
that with that game in the early days of the show and graffiti Kingdom of course

01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:39.740
there are tons and tons of DDR games if you want to get your music game thing on

01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:43.260
amplitude and frequency are both very good games even though you can't play

01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:47.820
amplitude online anymore I get the space channel 5 package their space channel 5

01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:51.500
part 1 & 2 were released together combined I'm unwinding my thing and I'm

01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:56.300

01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:19.620
the part of the show where we get angsty

01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:29.780
um I really don't have an FU to be honest I'm actually having a great week

01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:35.180
I passed algebra so I'm gonna say F you to the Photoshop selection tool that's

it Loki do you have an FU of the week I yeah F you the Comcast surprise yeah no

01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:48.980
big surprise yeah fuck them for not being able to hook up my cable correctly

01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:55.540
it apparently takes them numerous crews to do something very simple like running

01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:58.860
a drop to the street apparently they have a crew that specializes in

01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:02.340
underground installations oh but that crew doesn't know how to actually hook

01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:05.660
up anything they have to send out another crew to hook it up to the street

01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:08.940
oh but that guy doesn't know actually how to hook it up to the house and send

01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:12.500
another guy to the house to hook it up at the house oh but that guy needs to

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:16.460
have you know a person assess what needs to be hooked up first so they have to

01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:22.620
send somebody else out why don't you just I don't know train everybody for

01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:26.380
everything because I'm sure it's not going to be that difficult to teach

01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:32.220
somebody how to crimp on a new connector for a goddamn coax cable hell I did it

01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:37.860

02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:21.500
anyhow let's move on to where we at the Skype line no we got a couple more

02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:32.980
stories and then the Skype like Dan get a mic or GTFO all right 1877 game olr

02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:37.820
just a little bit right after two more stories for you guys Loki when I first

02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:42.620
saw this headline I was like sweet Xbox is finally getting all risque cuz they

02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:48.900
said goodbye gal gun panties I was like ooh I didn't think they would go there

02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:52.940
but no it's not unfortunately what I thought it was they're actually

02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:58.500
censoring the game and removing the panty shots so now you know the chick

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:04.100
has a different angle in her here per ponytail houses me covering her panty

02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:09.140
line and that kind of stuff apparently I guess 79 days before the game's released

02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:14.900
in Japan Microsoft call the meeting with the gal gun developer alchemist and they

02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:20.740
just basically said you know what we're gonna have to censor the game and not

02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:26.700
put all these panty shots in there but that's the point how are you gonna sell

02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:34.980
the game now they're saying now I don't know that they're just basically because

02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:43.340
I guess the game I don't know if the game uses the connector whatever maybe

02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:49.020
that you know they're trying to gear more towards like a family gamer now I

02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:54.500
don't I think they really game is fun for the whole family hot chicks bending

02:02:54.500 --> 02:03:01.580
over XNA game come on XNA here's something you use the connect for

02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:07.420
spanking when those when those naughty girls bend over you can spank them with

02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:11.500
the connect come on you know you want it what spanking game yesterday the Loki

02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:20.700
not my forte but you know the way for that who am I to judge other people you

02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:25.620
are here's here's a great story you're in love this and this is totally a time

02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:31.300
with what we're talking about and stuff there is a comic that was on Kotaku the

02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:36.700
ran a thing it was a visual guide to in fact I gotta find it real quick so I

02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:42.340
can show you in studio here is a visual guide to the ESRB and it showed a chick

02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:49.540
so and she was segmented as it went down so the E was her head T was you know her

02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:57.700
cleavage M was you know her naked naked vagina I guess censored obviously

02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:05.660
because it's you know it's classy and AO was tentacles sneaking up and now he's

02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:11.580
like what is that like it's it's tentacle rape and well it's something

02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:20.620
that's popular in Japan what she was unaware of the whole tentacle rape scene

02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:24.300
I guess you know Tiger Claw in our chat room says maybe it's the game parents

02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:29.620
will use when kids ask them where do babies come from they go solar flare in

02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:32.780
our chair in the chat dot orange on twitter.com says Rob spanking teaches

02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:39.660
kids to hit one more story for you guys and has to do with indie games and the

02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:46.060
Humble Bundle Humble Bundle 2 was released this past week and in less than

02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:51.780
24 hours after its release it got over $500,000 in revenue this is notable

02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:56.820
because this is one of those pay what you want type of games and five games

02:04:56.820 --> 02:05:03.660
for whatever you want to pay for it DRM free the biggest pair was Marcus person

02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:07.860
who spent $2,000 you might know him a little better as the guy who made

02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:12.620
Minecraft pay $2,000 for the set which you know he's sitting pretty right now

02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:19.940
with the whole Minecraft stuff Infinity Ward's Robert bowling spent $500 on the

02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:23.300
pack so there you go the average price that people are paying for this seven

02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:29.180
dollars and change the pack comes with braid cortex command machinarium osmose

02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:34.020
and revenge of the Titans you can divide your payments between the developers the

02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:38.660
electronic frontier front foundation and child's play charity so in other words

02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:40.940
if you don't want to pay the developers you want a hundred percent of your

02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:45.660
donation go to child's play go for it that indeed is some developers being

02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:50.500
very humble in allowing that to be sold very cool twitter.com slash humble for

02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:55.820
more information on that all right very cool we're gonna go to the skype line

02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:59.380

when they start coming in Loki do you have any last-minute stories for us no I

02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:34.900

people were doing with avatar oh really oh that's kind of cute what you're doing

02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:44.180
yeah I'm surprised there's no like filter thingy on Photoshop or one of

02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:49.340
those programs that will kind of automatically do something ish so all

02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:53.380
right well let's go to the phone we get a call coming in hi you are you look hi

02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:56.980
you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is excellent hi excellent what's

02:06:56.980 --> 02:07:00.420
on your mind buddy you forgot about one game series in particular for the ps2

02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:05.740
and I'm quite upset at you for doing this Rob all right persona series ah I

02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:09.900
thought somebody in chat said persona and I said it my bad no anything actually

02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:14.980
any title with Atlas is pretty much gold I haven't come across really one game

02:07:14.980 --> 02:07:18.820
from Alice is really so terrible that would not talk about it actually they

02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:23.460
have a really good game on ps3 a demon sword or no what am I thinking nope nope

02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:28.420
scratch that demon souls is the game that's out on ps3 that's that's a great

02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:32.500
ps3 exclusive game in fact I believe it was just given a price reduction because

02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:36.500
in the greatest hit series and servers think one of the stories that missed our

02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:39.580
show all this week but I remember reading the servers are gonna be open

02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:45.940
through at least March 2011 if not beyond I think definitely if you're

02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:51.260
looking for a long series of playtime with a role-playing game dot hack series

02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:55.980
is really really good there was the four games and then there was three for the G

02:07:55.980 --> 02:08:00.100
the GU which was happening right after so they keep the storyline pretty much

02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:02.860
intact throughout the whole thing but it's really cool how you can take your

02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:07.220
safe game from the first up from the first game but in the second take their

02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:10.820
stages the second game into the third the third game into the fourth so you

02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:14.780
can carry it on and then if you take it and put into the new series which

02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:19.300
happened few years after that they'll give you cool bonuses for doing so so I

02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:23.500
it pays to play it's really good ray craft in our

02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:26.980
Chatham is correcting me saying demon souls isn't an atlas game they just

02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:33.900
published it well still still is a great game but it has their name by it so SSJ

02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:38.340
100 they don't put their name behind sucky game so right as we don't get

02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:41.860
president cat and everything will be well exactly they need yet at president

02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:45.860
cat SSJ 100 Matt is also saying Disgaea now there's there's a good good

02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:51.260
suggestion and also also if you happen to be in a Japanese region earth defense

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:57.340
force 2 ooh good thought very good thought so what else is on your mind

02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:00.380
excellent what anything else fun and exciting going on in your gaming world

02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:03.100
well I don't know well I'm kind of disappointed you have invited me onto

02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:07.580
your show yet either considering that was the number one achieving core and

02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:10.900
your guilt for quite a while if I remember correctly before it's there

02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:17.180
someone took my spot but that's quite okay because you know I'm not gonna be

02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:21.020
better anything about that and you shouldn't be there's been thankfully

02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:24.460
there's been a lot of people that have wanted to be on so we're trying to give

02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:29.300
everybody a shot I know I'm playing rice princess was only on because we kind of

02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:33.700
needed someone in someone quickly so she came back on twice but we're gonna get

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:38.700
we're gonna get lots of people on so that's cool but yeah I'm very much

02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:43.080
enjoying cataclysm keeping up to the wee hours in the morning playing all the

02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:48.860
different stuff for how many hours have you spent on your archaeology only you

02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:53.820
know what it hasn't been that long believe it or not I spend almost

02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:58.940
probably in my two days probably give or take wow that's still a long time you're

02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:08.740
probably only up to level like 200 or I'm 420 I'm almost 425 20 or 25 nice I

02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:14.580
got excited because today I'm doing fossils or whatever and my next dig is

02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:19.260
going to be a pet oh there you go some pet the Raptor right yeah the little

02:10:19.260 --> 02:10:23.340
Raptor fossil raptor so that's that and actually makes me jealous because some

02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:26.340
of the battlegrounds now for like the mountain people met up there you think

02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:32.980
version of it and actually this will make you really jealous because you're

02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:35.820
an achievement whore and I'll leave you on this do you know what achievement I

02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:40.060
got today hmm stood in the fire oh really you're

02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:47.340
death wing showed up while I was doing archaeology alright did you survive or

02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:51.220
did you actually I actually survived not to turn this into the Wow show but I

02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:54.980
actually survived because what I did I flew through the fire instead of getting

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:58.340
on the ground and like I don't the timing or something worked out I got the

02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:03.380
achievement and didn't die my friend she was in ratchet and she actually lived

02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:06.940
with like one hit point or something was weird but nice you couldn't believe it

02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:10.180
she's like yeah I actually got an achievement but yet I live and she took

02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:13.940
an awesome screenshot of the town I mean just totally engulfed in flames

02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:17.900
everywhere I mean you couldn't even really tell it was bad for a bit because

02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:21.740
of the flames in the background but it was a really cool screenshot good times

02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:25.220
all right well I should let you go before the Wow haters come out and start

02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:30.940

lounge radio if you want to give us a call but we got a call coming in right

02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:02.180
now hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this would be miss Jessica

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:05.900
Harper hi Jessica Harper how are you I am doing just fine how are you guys

02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:10.380
doing great so glad to have you back on the show what's new I actually came with

02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:15.900
an agenda tonight Oh something that I believe you guys spoke about before as

02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:24.060
per my conversation with Jamie but we have us olr madness we are currently

02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:28.780
taking your top 25 lists and unfortunately we haven't received as

02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:32.820
many as we would like so you know what it is they're a bunch of procrastinators

02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:38.140
yeah I know but the deadline is coming up and and since us all will be on

02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:44.260
hiatus just based on how the holidays fall Oh since we have you know Christmas

02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:49.540
on a Saturday and then New Year's Eve on a Saturday yikes yeah yeah kind of puts

02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:52.460
us in a little bit of a hiatus so I thought I'd come and you know be a pain

02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:57.300
and you got in your ass and you know no worries on your show we did we think

02:12:57.300 --> 02:13:03.980
it's great what you guys do over there why why why us l olr madness because it

02:13:03.980 --> 02:13:08.060
is the way that you the gaming audience can actually get your voice out there

02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:14.580
and be heard and you know show what the real games that people love are rather

02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:20.500
than those that are just being you know highly profitable because people are

02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:24.220
spending way too much money on stupid shit and it won't be rigged for Final

02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:29.520
Fantasy 7 like the game facts contests are every year every year it's Final

02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:36.180
Fantasy 7 something yeah exactly now father seven could we could win it has

02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:41.540
been in the top like 16 but I don't believe it's won a madness title yet I

02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:45.420
don't believe so I don't say for certain but I don't believe so I don't think any

02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:48.620
Final Fantasy game has come to think of it I know Super Metroid's one chrono

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:52.460
triggers one and I think Mario Brothers 3 has won a couple times and chrono

02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:56.940
trigger is up there very very very far it's all the listeners wanting to spite

02:13:56.940 --> 02:14:03.780
me for saying it's overrated if anybody wants to get their top 25 listed and has

02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:09.900
not yet just go ahead and formulate your top 25 list send it to usl madness at

02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:16.540
gmail.com we will tack it on in with the rest of the votes and deadline is

02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:21.540
January 3rd so get your votes in and we will be starting right after the

02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:26.300
holidays excited to see it I'm trying to pull up my list that I had actually sent

02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:31.140
to Bresl so I can give you a little taste taste of what I'm rooting for here

02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:34.620
hold on I'm trying to pull it up my email archive here I said I set my list

02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:39.020
on November 30th because I'm a very good boy you're a good boy um here I'll give

02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:43.740
you just a little taste my number one game of course was Super Metroid I mean

02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:48.580
it is the best game ever my number two game this year was the civilization

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:53.020
series I think between five out this year and four being so epic and the

02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:58.180
original being so awesome I think Civ is deserving of a spot that high up and

02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:01.980
just you know with five this year I was just like oh this is all amazeballs my

02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:06.500
number three game was Castlevania Symphony of the night Metroidvania of

02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:10.740
course you've got to put it up high up there and my four number four game this

02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:15.060
year Final Fantasy six so I did put a file has a game in my top five um my

02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:17.860
number 25 game I'm not gonna read the whole list for you guys my number 25

02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:20.220
game this year cuz I always like to be controversial and put something kind of

02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:24.540
like really random in there plants versus zombies you know I put plants

02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:28.660
versus zombies on my list too oh maybe it'll make the top 64 then but that's

02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:32.420
the weird thing is that John has been keeping good track of things and it has

02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:38.500
not breached the top 25 recently hmm during the initial voting it was one of

02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:42.260
the top 25 and it did get pushed out it's not even in the bubble zone right

02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:47.620
now so well if you love plants versus zombies you better put it on your list

02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:52.020
if you think plants and zombies is the greatest game ever made you better hurry

02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:55.620
the hell up and get in there yes

02:15:56.100 --> 02:16:00.220
awesome well what else anything else going on in your world Jessica sure

02:16:00.220 --> 02:16:05.780
well I got a new computer and I have a brand new video card that I'm ready to

02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:10.580
put into it but it is a slim computer and while I did get a low-profile card I

02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:16.280
do not have the proper brackets for it so I'm in a holding pattern once again

02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:20.320
and just waiting for my brackets so I can put my new video card in actually

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:24.140
start doing some decent PC gaming so I I actually had something similar happen

02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:28.460
when I bought a new video card it was so uber it wouldn't fit in there with the

02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:32.140
power supply so we had to get a new power supply as well to make it all work

02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:37.660
yeah yeah no it's it's gonna be a very tight squeeze and I'm not quite sure

02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:40.780
exactly how it's gonna work but I'll make it work dammit there you go so when

02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:46.260
he's signing up for Wow no I'm kidding no I have a feeling that I might end up

02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:54.100
with Star Trek online somewhere in my mailbox at some point I'm not sure so if

02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:56.880
you want a 10-day trial let me know I may still have another card dark soccer's

02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:01.380
recruiting we shall see we shall see all right oh yeah and of course that of

02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:05.820
course Travis is a big fan of that too is Disney so yes I wouldn't be surprised

02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:09.820
at all all right well Jessica good luck with the new PC I hope it brings you

02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:08.500
and the party already where the time go there's just it's it even though we try

02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:12.260
to fill the show with lots of news sometimes the news doesn't have a lot of

02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:17.620
discussion to go with it I mean there's not a lot to say to you know Shadow the

02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:22.420
Hedgehog was made for Americans or whatever or yeah you know Sony

02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:28.620
PlayStation shadow my two cents about the in the chat room yeah all right well

02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:34.060
what's on your mind buddy why'd you call well to satisfy Brussels I finally sent

02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:40.060
up my 25 cuz I realized I didn't play enough games this year to qualify so I'm

02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:44.140
sitting there for about an hour putting my list together and picking the brains

02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:47.660
of my roommates for what games did you like and I was like keep in mind it's

02:18:47.660 --> 02:18:53.100
not the top 25 of this year it's the top 25 of all time I know but still I just

02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:56.260
feel I don't really game enough for it but I got my list together and I sent it

02:18:56.260 --> 02:19:01.220
out all right good boy and I did put on their Final Fantasy 6 good good man

02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:05.600
that's a great Final Fantasy game although um Final Fantasy 4 I sometimes

02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:09.600
call my favorite I gave it a little bit of a backseat which is funny because I

02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:14.660
sent that list in before the news about the PSP version it will probably be back

02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:22.620
near the top of my list next year after I play the PSP version so we'll see so

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:25.500
all right well what was at the top of your list can I be nosy what was your

02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:30.040
number one game ever Scott Pilgrim versus the world the game what was your

02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:35.660
number one game of all time I loved that game this is one the few games where I

02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:40.900
sat there and played it over and over and over and this is one of those games

02:19:40.900 --> 02:19:44.900
where yeah tap the bank for the crack that's that's what that game fell under

02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:49.240
for me all right where every gamer has a voice even when those voices are insane

02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:54.340
um just kidding I'm kidding if you like I never see ransom I mean really I'm

02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:58.380
giving you shit actually I'm watching Loki in studios playing I think the new

02:19:58.380 --> 02:20:01.420
version of Super Mario crossover like there was a brand new version that came

02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:06.300
out but he is driving the blaster master car and that made me think oh man

02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:11.840
blaster master should have been on my list blaster masters in Mario

02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:16.420
crossover yes they just added Sofia the car from a blaster master is now in

02:20:16.420 --> 02:20:21.220
Mario crossover version and it's awesome I now have my reason to play the game

02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:27.220
I'm going to tell my roommate and he is going to he's gonna fangasm yeah I need

02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:31.300
somebody to send in the top 25 list that has blaster master near the top to me to

02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:34.180
make up for the fact that I left it off my list all right dark soccer says she

02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:37.980
will I still haven't sent my listen oh good good I need some blaster master

02:20:37.980 --> 02:20:43.140
love because I forgot so I'm an idiot we have to send this listen I believe the

02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:46.700
third was the deadline but you're procrastinating but should do it right

02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:56.380
now all right anything else in your mind tonight Rama yeah do you think

02:20:56.380 --> 02:21:04.780
programmers purposely put code into games where you swear it cheats um it

02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:09.220
depends on the type of game but like when you say games that cheat my mind

02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:14.060
automatically goes immediately goes to Super Mario Kart and the whole rubber

02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:18.660
banding and this is a very common thing you hear in racing games it's not Mario

02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:21.820
Kart is not the only racing game that does it a lot of them do but I yes

02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:25.740
that's that's basically program cheating is that if you are too far ahead of the

02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:28.740
other contestants they get to speed boost or whatever to catch up to you

02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:32.820
that's programmed to cheat to make it more exciting so heck yeah I think they

02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:36.660
program cheating but that's just the difficulty or whatever you want to call

02:21:36.660 --> 02:21:42.140
it I never had a problem Mario Kart but I can understand how you code a game so

02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:46.660
there's some glitches here and there that may cause cheating but I'm talking

02:21:46.660 --> 02:21:50.940
purpose gene for example my roommates playing Dragon Age he is in an area

02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:56.580
where he has to go in and like take everybody out it's like his team of four

02:21:56.580 --> 02:22:00.780
grown up of a team of eight says he walks into the area that whole team just

02:22:00.780 --> 02:22:04.860
slaughters him under 15 minutes think screaming repulsive repeatedly at the

02:22:04.860 --> 02:22:09.220
game is cheating with me personally I don't think the game cheat you just suck

02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:13.420
but that that dates all the way back to the NES days when like you would be

02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:18.740
playing a sports game or any time you gave RC Pro-Am was another racer that

02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:22.820
would just infuriate people the game's fucking cheating man this game fucking

02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:31.740
cheats actually put in purpose code for cheating compared to where your skills

02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:35.740
aren't good enough padawan or it's just ramping up the difficulty keep in mind a

02:22:35.740 --> 02:22:38.940
lot of those you know NES and if you want to go way back Atari 2600 games

02:22:38.940 --> 02:22:43.820
we're set to loop over and over and over again so of course the difficulty gets

02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:48.380
insane and harder than you know you're able to do at some point because that's

02:22:48.380 --> 02:22:53.580
just you know what it is of course so like or take a game like civilization

02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:59.740
and its highest difficulty level I believe the computer opponents can build

02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:04.940
resources like 1.4 times as fast as you can so you have to really think about

02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:09.740
how to you know use your resources well I don't think that's really cheating

02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:14.540
the game is cheaper say that's just like advanced skill God mode it's like you

02:23:14.540 --> 02:23:17.740
know what you're getting yourself into when you walk into it yeah and if you

02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:22.140
can beat that then you're a fucking stud like you are like you but you know going

02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:25.860
into it okay I am playing an uphill battle here and if I beat this I'm

02:23:25.860 --> 02:23:33.580
awesome mm-hmm so yeah all right well Rama we're gonna let you go to try and
