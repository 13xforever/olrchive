00:00.000 --> 00:19.600
Tonight, December 5th, 2010, video evidence shows the PSP phone may be the real deal.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.920
PETA parodies Super Meat Boy to a strong response, and the video game song finally gets nominated

00:24.920 --> 00:32.280
for a Grammy.

00:32.280 --> 00:36.440
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.440 --> 00:37.440
Radio.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.720
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.720 --> 00:47.880
We are live on this December 5th of 2010 at www.allgames.com for the 392nd episode of

00:47.880 --> 00:48.880
our show.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
That's a lot of shows.

00:49.880 --> 00:50.880
Alright, my name is Rob Roberts.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.780
I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games with my awesome

00:53.780 --> 00:57.080
co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.080
I have a little dreidel.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.080
Is it made out of clay?

01:00.080 --> 01:01.080
I don't know.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.080
Yes.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.080
Alright.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.080
No, mine was wood.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.760
Happy Hanukkah, Ms. Summers.

01:05.760 --> 01:06.760
Thank you.

01:06.760 --> 01:07.760
How long have you been celebrating Hanukkah?

01:07.760 --> 01:10.720
Did you do anything besides light some fire?

01:10.720 --> 01:12.840
I went to Temple and Dan went with me.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.840
Oh, wow.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.840
Okay.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.840
Yeah, and we had lots of fire.

01:16.840 --> 01:17.840
Nice.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.780
Everyone brought their hanukiah, which is the hanukkah menorah.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.880
And we lit candles on fire.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Good times.

01:25.880 --> 01:26.880
It was gorgeous and very warm.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.880
Well, is there any rock band?

01:27.880 --> 01:31.880
Because I know you're, and for those that are new to OLR, Dark Sakura went through the

01:31.880 --> 01:35.000
whole Judaism conversion, what about a year ago you probably started this?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Maybe a year and a half?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I started it in last July.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.200
Okay, so it's been a little while.

01:39.200 --> 01:43.160
But I know like now she has a lot of new friends through the Jew school, basically is what

01:43.160 --> 01:44.160
I call it.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.080
And the Jews love rock band.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.640
So I'm kind of curious if you've gotten your rock band on during-

01:49.640 --> 01:51.400
Well, my friends do.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.920
Because that's the one thing I noticed, I came over once I think for Jamie's birthday

01:54.920 --> 01:57.360
and you know, all the Jew school friends were here.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.520
And they were loving some rock band and I was like, okay.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.960
I didn't really play much rock band.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.200
I've actually, I'm not going to be doing a lot of gaming for the next week and a half.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.240
Because number one, Dan has Gran Turismo 5.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.240
And number two, finals.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.240
Bummer.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.240
Yeah.

02:13.240 --> 02:14.240
Busy week.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.360
Bummer on both counts.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.360
I'm just kidding.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.360
I'm not hating on Gran Turismo 5.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.360
I am.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.000
Just to be serious, I'm not very good at the-

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I'm angry.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm angry.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I'm angry.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm angry.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm great at arcade razors like Mario Kart and-

02:25.000 --> 02:28.160
How can the Veyron not be a premium car?

02:28.160 --> 02:29.160
IDK.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.160
Bastards.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.160
All right.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.280
Also say hello to, we got to introduce tech master, Loki.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.280
Hello.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.280
How are you?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.280
Loki?

02:36.280 --> 02:37.280
I'm doing fine.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.280
Oh, alrighty.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.280
Good to hear it.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.280
I know you're not, well no, your wife celebrates Hanukkah.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.720
So have you been doing anything for that?

02:41.720 --> 02:42.720
No.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.720
No?

02:43.720 --> 02:44.720
All right.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.720
You're more of a, like a Chrismakka kind of family though, right?

02:47.720 --> 02:48.720
A little bit?

02:48.720 --> 02:49.720
Yeah.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.720
Really.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.720
Yeah.

02:51.720 --> 02:52.720
Yeah.

02:52.720 --> 02:53.720
That's the retail Christmas.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.720
There you go.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.720
That works.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.720
What are you, what are you knitting over there, Dark Stock?

02:56.720 --> 02:58.400
Are you making arts and crafts at OLR?

02:58.400 --> 03:02.640
Um, I'm making a hat for a present for a friend who wants a hat.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.240
And I'm, I took some leftover yarn and made myself a knit headband so I could be trendy.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.880
You could make one of those in like an orange color and probably sell it for like 20 bucks.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.160
I know, there you go.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.560
Maybe this is something I could do while I'm not working.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.320
I also do want to take a moment to poll our listeners and send us an email.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.320
Sure.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.440
It's on our website at orangelandradio.com so Rob can read it.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.440
Okay.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.440
Wait a minute.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.720
Hey, um, who would be interested in an Orange Lounge book?

03:28.720 --> 03:30.240
I got a text message about this.

03:30.240 --> 03:33.360
I want to know more about your thoughts on this.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.840
Why you suddenly want to do a book.

03:34.840 --> 03:39.040
Well, I'm sure the not having a job right now has a lot to do with that.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.600
To commemorate our fans and how, talk how awesome we are.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.600
Would it be a pop up book?

03:43.600 --> 03:45.280
Cause I'm not good with writing.

03:45.280 --> 03:49.900
It would be a physical book to be ordered or an ebook.

03:49.900 --> 03:50.900
An ebook.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.600
Can it be something I listen to on my iPod?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
Cause that makes sense.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.920
Cause you know it is a radio show.

03:54.920 --> 04:02.960
No, it's a physical book with pictures and links to goodies.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.960
It's like the OLR yearbook.

04:04.960 --> 04:05.960
And Easter eggs.

04:05.960 --> 04:06.960
Alright.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.040
Alright, well I got, I got to see what this is all about.

04:09.040 --> 04:14.200
You know, one of, one of the other shows on all games does a magazine, the Electric Sisterhood

04:14.200 --> 04:19.800
I think it is, does the magazine and I apologize if I'm misappropriating that, but you know,

04:19.800 --> 04:21.960
it's been done where the shows move into other mediums.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.160
So sure, OLR can have a book.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
Why not?

04:25.160 --> 04:28.600
I think Michelle on the Outsiders shows has a book deal, but I don't think it has anything

04:28.600 --> 04:30.360
to do with her shows.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.640
You know the, um, what is that site?

04:32.640 --> 04:33.640
Oh God.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.120
It's been everywhere and it's, it's her and her sister's site.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.080
Uh, damn you autocorrect.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.080
That's it.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.080
Have you seen that site?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.080
That's her site.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
Oh.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.600
And I think she's got a book now going on about it.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.600
So you know.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.600
Cool.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.280
If, if all these other all games people can do a book, so can we.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.280
Damn it.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.280
Why not?

04:50.280 --> 04:52.080
Alright, anyway.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.280
Ours just won't be as good.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.280
Okay, anyway.

04:54.280 --> 04:55.280
I'm designing it.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.280
It'll be amazing.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.280
Oh.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.280
Well, what'd you see?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.280
I just got kicked in the face.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.280
Alright, anyway.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.400
Uh, all books aside, let's talk about video games and the games we've been playing this

05:03.400 --> 05:04.400
week.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.200
Dark Sakura, what types of games have you been playing this week?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.200
Nothing.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.200
Nothing?

05:08.200 --> 05:12.840
Well, actually Star Trek Online because I'm updating the Tribble server right now.

05:12.840 --> 05:21.960
At, like, 1K, so, um, I, uh, well, I played some solitaire.

05:21.960 --> 05:26.680
I've been very busy because, um, the American River Review, which is the magazine that I've

05:26.680 --> 05:29.760
done some design for, goes to print on Monday, and we had-

05:29.760 --> 05:31.760
This is where the book idea's coming from.

05:31.760 --> 05:36.240
No, actually, I got the idea from the book I did for my client because we just published

05:36.240 --> 05:37.240
it.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.240
Oh, okay.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.240
Um, it was really easy.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.960
So, uh, it'd be very easy for us to do a book.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.180
But back to, back to, uh, this.

05:44.180 --> 05:49.240
The American River Review, um, and as soon as we have the order information up, I'll

05:49.240 --> 05:55.240
be linking it to everybody, because you have to buy a copy, um, but the American River

05:55.240 --> 06:01.920
Review is, uh, all of the, uh, literature, the art, digital, physical media, fashion

06:01.920 --> 06:06.760
and culinary for, um, American River College for 2011.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.880
We win tons of awards.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.060
We beat out big schools.

06:10.060 --> 06:11.060
We are amazing.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.320
I did the culinary section.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.920
I designed it anyway.

06:15.920 --> 06:21.320
And, um, I think it's, it's definitely, you know, something that anybody should have a

06:21.320 --> 06:24.080
copy of because it really is an impressive product.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.080
And we had our proofs.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.160
We got our proofs last week, and so that's what's been taking up my time instead of games.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.120
But you said the hubby's been playing Gran Turismo 5, right?

06:31.120 --> 06:33.040
Oh, well, when we did have some Scott Pilgrim.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.360
Oh, fun.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.360
Yeah.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.240
Uh, what is, is Gran Turismo 5 pretty?

06:37.240 --> 06:40.120
Yes, except for the shadows are retarded.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.120
A little early for that music.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.320
Pretty as in that music.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
As in that music?

06:44.320 --> 06:45.320
Is this as pretty as that music?

06:45.320 --> 06:48.040
Some of the music in the game is very elevator-y.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.640
I, I just want to say-

06:49.640 --> 06:52.160
Well, there's new My Chemical Romance in there that makes me happy.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.200
Dark Soccer gave me a beer before tonight's show, so if things are a little bit off tonight,

06:55.200 --> 06:58.640
like what just happened, you know what, just, just roll with it.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.640
How's it off?

06:59.640 --> 07:01.640
This always happens.

07:01.640 --> 07:07.320
Well, at any rate, at any rate, um, it's, it's got some stuff that needs to be fixed.

07:07.320 --> 07:11.640
I still hate that all the people around the track are like, we're just standing here,

07:11.640 --> 07:14.360
we are stiff, we don't do anything but wave.

07:14.360 --> 07:18.760
And I'd like to see more stuff going around, because, because the game can handle it, it's

07:18.760 --> 07:19.760
just not.

07:19.760 --> 07:20.760
And then-

07:20.760 --> 07:23.080
You want to see some women flashing their titties as you drive by.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.080
That's what, that's what the game needs.

07:24.080 --> 07:30.120
It is, the cool thing in this game is that it has the, um, the Top Gear test track, and

07:30.120 --> 07:31.340
the Stig.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.600
And your driver looks kind of like the Stig from Top Gear.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.480
But it doesn't have Rainbow Road, which is really disappointing.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.900
It does have go-karts.

07:39.900 --> 07:44.000
It would be awesome if they just, you know, cuz, come on, it's Gran Turismo, they take

07:44.000 --> 07:49.520
themselves way too damn seriously, um, just throw in some wacky shit in there, it's like,

07:49.520 --> 07:52.040
you know, we're driving in space now.

07:52.040 --> 07:58.320
I mean, cuz it's a real, a realistic sim racing game, but just put it in some very unrealistic

07:58.320 --> 08:02.440
situations and have fun.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.400
Gran Turismo 6, in space!

08:06.400 --> 08:09.240
At any rate, it is, uh, very British.

08:09.240 --> 08:14.320
Um, and I really can't describe that other than just saying, watch the game, it's very

08:14.320 --> 08:15.320
British.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.400
Um, I totally laughed my ass off at the rally section, because Dan was trying to beat the

08:19.400 --> 08:22.280
rally cars, you know, focus.

08:22.280 --> 08:27.640
And uh, well I mean, that's a good rally car, so, but I was like, very hard, easy right?

08:27.640 --> 08:34.640
You know, making, doing the, the Sega touring, or Sega rally voiceover, so it was pretty

08:34.640 --> 08:35.640
funny.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.000
Um, they're supposed to be doing a patch that's supposed to fix a lot of the problems, so,

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
we'll see.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.080
I just sit in there sometimes and listen to the elevator music and usually I fall asleep

08:43.080 --> 08:45.380
while Dan's playing.

08:45.380 --> 08:46.380
So that's it.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.920
Alright, let's go over to Loki!

08:48.920 --> 08:50.640
How was your gaming week?

08:50.640 --> 08:54.400
Doing, uh, you know, not too much gaming this week.

08:54.400 --> 09:00.400
Uh, mainly though, been playing, uh, this is kind of funny, it's an iOS game called

09:00.400 --> 09:08.000
Swords in Poker 2, and it's, it's really like, it's like a chibi role playing game, but the

09:08.000 --> 09:12.800
whole battle system, not so much, I mean kind of like puzzle quests I guess, they, you have

09:12.800 --> 09:20.080
a grid of, um, you start off with a grid of five by five, and then um, in the middle there's

09:20.080 --> 09:27.520
a grid of, uh, three, three by three poker cards, and the whole goal is to make up different

09:27.520 --> 09:32.460
poker hands, and by doing that you do specific amounts of damage to the monster that you're

09:32.460 --> 09:37.240
attacking, and then, you know, the monster does the same thing as well, and you can charge

09:37.240 --> 09:42.880
up a wild card and stuff, and then they have different magic that you can cast that rearranges

09:42.880 --> 09:47.340
some of the cards or does different things, or, um, you know, shields that block certain

09:47.340 --> 09:49.160
damage and stuff like that.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.160
It's actually really fun.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.160
I've been playing...

09:51.160 --> 09:53.480
Is it a free game, or when you had to pay, or what?

09:53.480 --> 09:55.240
Um, no, it does cost money.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.240
Okay.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.600
I don't know how much money, but it costs money.

09:58.600 --> 09:59.600
Alright.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.800
Um, and yeah, very awesome game, so I've been playing that most of the week, and then other

10:03.800 --> 10:08.000
than that, just probably, uh, Grand Theft Auto.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.360
That's pretty much it.

10:09.360 --> 10:14.960
Go into our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, there's a little bit of chatter going on with

10:14.960 --> 10:17.240
our ever-present fourth guest on the show, you guys.

10:17.240 --> 10:21.120
Uh, lots of talk on Gran Turismo 5, Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, Gran Turismo 5 looks

10:21.120 --> 10:25.360
so amazing, can't help but be mesmerized by the graphics as I watch people play the game

10:25.360 --> 10:26.360
on Justin.tv.

10:26.360 --> 10:31.480
And Justin.tv, from what I remember when we were doing our video feed on there, uh, in

10:31.480 --> 10:32.760
the old studio, it doesn't...

10:32.760 --> 10:37.480
It's not like it has the best quality, so if that still comes across really well, uh,

10:37.480 --> 10:38.480
that's pretty amazing.

10:38.480 --> 10:42.560
Um, Dart Datsuya says, reminds me, whatever happened to the Gran Turismo kids' things

10:42.560 --> 10:43.720
they were supposedly doing?

10:43.720 --> 10:45.120
I don't even remember that.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.360
Wait, Loki just kind of did this, ah, bleh.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.360
Hey, it'll never happen.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.360
Who cares?

10:49.360 --> 10:50.360
It stinks.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.360
It'll be coming out soon.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.960
By soon we mean six years, I don't know.

10:53.960 --> 10:54.960
Alright.

10:54.960 --> 10:59.720
Uh, let's see, and, uh, some of the folks in chat are talking a little bit about Gran

10:59.720 --> 11:00.880
Turismo songs.

11:00.880 --> 11:06.320
Uh, DJ Dark Knight says, need Kickstart My Heart, the best Gran Turismo song ever.

11:06.320 --> 11:11.600
And Dark Datsuya says, actually, that's the first song on my Gran Turismo 3 playlist.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.440
So, hm, a lot of talk about the soundtrack of Gran Turismo.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.440
Have you noticed the soundtrack?

11:16.440 --> 11:17.440
It's got new...

11:17.440 --> 11:19.480
Well, I said earlier it has New My Chemical Romance in there.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.480
Oh, that's right.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.480
That's right.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.480
You were talking about all that.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.480
Well, once...

11:23.480 --> 11:25.080
That's a nova!

11:25.080 --> 11:29.400
One song that I do not believe is on the Gran Turismo 5 soundtrack, but is in a game we're

11:29.400 --> 11:31.480
gonna be talking about a little later tonight, is...

11:31.480 --> 11:34.640
I believe you made me want to stay.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.800
That's right, that Happy Hardcore song from Techno Kitten Adventure.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.720
It's Sea of Love by Frisco, if you wanted to know who it is.

11:41.720 --> 11:45.960
Uh, you might remember last week on the show, we got a tweet saying that we needed to check

11:45.960 --> 11:51.480
out this game called Techno Kitten Adventure, and, uh, we were laughing our ass off, because

11:51.480 --> 11:52.480
it's just awesome.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.280
Like, you know, laughing with them, not at them.

11:55.280 --> 12:01.200
Uh, it's, you know, as people who play DDR for years and years, um, you know, this type

12:01.200 --> 12:05.800
of music's right up our alley, and the fact that this whole music video is, uh, interactive,

12:05.800 --> 12:09.280
and, you know, when they talk about touching the sky, there's actually a little finger

12:09.280 --> 12:11.040
that comes down and touches the sky.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.040
Like, shit like that is hilarious.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.480
So this game's a dollar, and it's on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.960
We're gonna have the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure on the show tonight.

12:18.960 --> 12:23.520
That's right, from tweet to on-air interview in one week, it's amazing what can happen

12:23.520 --> 12:24.520
here at OLR.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.960
We're gonna have Nick from Techno Kitten Adventure at 7 o'clock, that's just over 30 minutes

12:27.960 --> 12:28.960
away.

12:28.960 --> 12:29.960
That's exciting.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.480
Loki, you checked out Techno Kitten Adventure, huh?

12:32.480 --> 12:34.040
You thought it was a little basic.

12:34.040 --> 12:41.880
Uh, yeah, I played it a little bit, um, I don't know, it's similar to, I guess, like

12:41.880 --> 12:46.800
the robot unicorn attack games, where the concept's very simple, but what draws you

12:46.800 --> 12:51.920
into the game is just the fact that it's so unusual, I guess.

12:51.920 --> 12:52.920
Mm-hmm.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.920
Mm-hmm.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.160
But, I mean, the gameplay itself, it's all one button, you just, you know, a button to

12:57.160 --> 12:59.720
control the thrust on a jetpack.

12:59.720 --> 13:05.800
I just, I don't know, if I were to improve something upon the game, I would maybe tighten

13:05.800 --> 13:11.560
up the controls a little bit, at level 3, um, and then also, uh, maybe, you know, make

13:11.560 --> 13:12.560
it a little harder.

13:12.560 --> 13:17.080
Well, we're gonna ask him if there's any plans for a sequel, because, uh, the game has shown

13:17.080 --> 13:20.440
up in the top games on Xbox Live Indie Games, right?

13:20.440 --> 13:21.440
It's there.

13:21.440 --> 13:25.440
It's not like the number one game, but it's not number 500, it's there.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.520
So we definitely wanna ask him about that.

13:27.520 --> 13:31.320
And I played the game as well, and, you know, even though it is as basic, let's say, as

13:31.320 --> 13:37.080
an Atari 2600 game, I think, in fact I'm pretty sure I played a game like this on Atari 2600,

13:37.080 --> 13:44.480
I think the environment that he created and just the, um, you know, absurdity, outside

13:44.480 --> 13:49.000
the box type of thinking he constructed the game around is clearly this, wouldn't this

13:49.000 --> 13:53.720
be funny if I combined X with Y and made Z, and I think it really works, especially for

13:53.720 --> 13:54.720
a dollar.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.720
It's a dollar.

13:55.720 --> 13:56.720
Rob.

13:56.720 --> 13:57.720
Rob, what?

13:57.720 --> 13:59.160
Dear, please don't say combine X, Y, make Z.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.160
Why?

14:00.160 --> 14:01.160
Algebra, hell.

14:01.160 --> 14:04.800
Are you having, are you having, uh, flashbacks to school?

14:04.800 --> 14:05.800
Ahhh!

14:05.800 --> 14:06.800
Alright, now.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.080
That's what my final's in.

14:08.080 --> 14:12.480
If 2X plus Y equals Z, solve for kitten.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.480
Meow.

14:13.480 --> 14:18.560
Alright, so we're gonna talk a little bit about that, and I wanna know if he has any

14:18.560 --> 14:22.040
other games on the marketplace as well, so we have to ask him all those questions, and

14:22.040 --> 14:24.280
I think it's worth it for one whole dollar.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.320
It's, it's the type of game you're gonna whip out a party and, like, look at what I

14:27.320 --> 14:28.320
downloaded.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.320
Bobby's giving Loki a hard time.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.320
Why's that?

14:30.320 --> 14:31.320
In chat?

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
You can't get more tight than one flippin' button.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.000
Well, you know, we were talking to Bobby, and of course, Bobby Blackwolf is the gentleman

14:35.000 --> 14:38.840
that does the show before us at All Games Radio, the Bobby, Bobby, the Blobbly, the

14:38.840 --> 14:45.680
Bobby Blackwolf show, uh, every Sunday night at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, and he always has

14:45.680 --> 14:48.680
us on at the very end of the show, which is very nice, he doesn't have to do that, but

14:48.680 --> 14:53.000
we were talking about this game a little bit, and, uh, we were kind of talking about how

14:53.000 --> 14:58.160
– we like that somebody went there and did this and didn't just try to make a, a clone

14:58.160 --> 15:04.840
of some other game, because we're all about the whole kind of, like, absurd, outside-the-box

15:04.840 --> 15:05.840
sorts of ideas.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.120
Remember President Cat a year and a half ago?

15:08.120 --> 15:10.280
Why were we all excited about President Cat?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.600
It wasn't really the game itself, per se.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.200
I'm sure the game itself was really just an average game, and I think a lot of the

15:16.200 --> 15:20.400
blogs who ultimately reported on, wow, there's this podcast trying to get this game called

15:20.400 --> 15:24.880
President Cat localized, what a bunch of weirdos, haha, I don't think they ever got that the

15:24.880 --> 15:28.720
reason behind that wasn't necessarily the game itself, it was the fact that you look

15:28.720 --> 15:32.320
at the Wii's lineup, and they're all clones of each other.

15:32.320 --> 15:38.640
You know, it's, it's Nick Jr. games, and PopCap ripoffs galore, and Wii Sports ripoffs,

15:38.640 --> 15:40.840
it's all the same damn thing.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.840
President Cat, for what it's worth, was something different.

15:43.840 --> 15:48.920
You play this cat driving a car and running a company, and it's, it's like that old,

15:48.920 --> 15:49.920
uh –

15:49.920 --> 15:50.920
Just playing the piano.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.400
Yes, and absolutely playing the piano.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.040
Why can't we get original shit like that?

15:56.040 --> 16:00.080
You know, why do we have to get these games we know are sub-par and below?

16:00.080 --> 16:01.800
It's just, I don't know.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.800
Because we're America!

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
Yeah, I know.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.800
Fuck you, man.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.800
For everything is mediocre.

16:05.800 --> 16:06.800
Ugh.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.800
Alright, so anyway.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.280
Oh yeah, uh, Majinma Khan in our chatroom says, uh, Muscle March.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.240
That was a pretty unique Wii game, I will say that.

16:14.240 --> 16:18.000
There was at least that, so, uh, it's, it's working.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Anyhow, uh, so we'll get to, uh, more talk on Techno Kitten Adventure in about 30 minutes,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.480
but in the meantime, uh, my gaming week, I didn't talk about my gaming week, I, I guess

16:25.480 --> 16:28.960
I mentioned Techno Kitten Adventure, and, uh, I didn't play a whole lot else.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.800
I played quite a bit of World of Warcraft, because there's big changes going on this

16:31.800 --> 16:35.620
week, but, um, you know, I have the other show for that now, uh, so not a whole lot

16:35.620 --> 16:40.520
I want to say here, uh, otherwise other games I played some more Super Meat Boy, uh, which

16:40.520 --> 16:44.400
I think is a great Xbox Live Arcade game, and, um, that was really about it.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.280
I had a work trip this week, so I didn't really get to play a whole lot of games at

16:47.280 --> 16:48.280
home.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.400
So, sorry guys, I'll try to play more next week.

16:50.400 --> 16:56.060
Anyhow, uh, housekeeping tonight, join our Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge

16:56.060 --> 17:00.520
radio, and of course our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, we'll be taking Twitter topics

17:00.520 --> 17:05.520
later in the show, so definitely submit those topics, and, uh, email, email our show, mailbag

17:05.520 --> 17:09.200
at orange lounge radio dot com, Dark Soccer's gonna read those in part B a little later

17:09.200 --> 17:10.240
in the show.

17:10.240 --> 17:14.080
For now though, we're gonna get into the news, Loki's gonna start us off tonight with some

17:14.080 --> 17:15.080
gaming news.

17:15.080 --> 17:25.320
Oh yes, um, so, you know, it was funny because they were actually, uh, quoting, uh, one of

17:25.320 --> 17:32.080
the quotes made about this device, allegedly, was that, where there's smoke there's fire,

17:32.080 --> 17:35.520
well, I don't think you can get much more fire than this.

17:35.520 --> 17:42.440
Uh, the Playstation phone, of course, remember a while back they had some not so clear video

17:42.440 --> 17:47.920
of, you know, the device, and people were like, well, you know, it's probably changed

17:47.920 --> 17:53.740
quite a bit since then and whatnot, but now they have really clear video, um, showing

17:53.740 --> 18:01.800
this brand new, uh, device called the Sony Ericsson, uh, Zeus Z1 Playstation phone, and,

18:01.800 --> 18:08.120
uh, it kinda shows some of the features it has, the slide out controls, the, you know,

18:08.120 --> 18:15.120
dual kind of, uh, touchpad thing on the front that simulates the analog sticks, uh, of course,

18:15.120 --> 18:21.160
you know, the shoulder buttons as well, um, something that looks like, uh, it made possibly

18:21.160 --> 18:28.660
a front and back mounted camera, um, lots of neat stuff though that you would expect

18:28.660 --> 18:33.480
in, like, a Playstation phone, um, and they even had some video, of course, showing them

18:33.480 --> 18:37.720
going to, like, the actual Playstation mode where, um, you could play different games

18:37.720 --> 18:41.560
and stuff, of course, there's no games loaded on there, so, couldn't really do anything

18:41.560 --> 18:47.040
with that, um, but it's very interesting to see all this stuff, considering that they've

18:47.040 --> 18:53.360
kinda been denying, you know, oh, yeah, we're not working on a Playstation phone. Obviously,

18:53.360 --> 18:56.860
something I would be willing to bet you'll see at CES, cause they, like, shown off this

18:56.860 --> 19:01.600
new hardware stuff and, you know, it seems right up their alley. Here's the question

19:01.600 --> 19:06.880
I gotta ask about this, is this the same thing as the PSP2? Because we've heard rumors about

19:06.880 --> 19:11.800
a PSP phone, and we've heard rumors about a PSP2, and my question is, is it actually

19:11.800 --> 19:16.700
the same thing? Because I thought the rumors about there being, um, sliders on the back

19:16.700 --> 19:20.600
and all this other weird stuff that we're seeing in this video was for the PSP2. And

19:20.600 --> 19:26.040
now that you mention it, that does make sense, the one, the not so clear video or pictures

19:26.040 --> 19:30.700
that we saw before were of the Playstation Portal 2. Of course, we've seen some pictures

19:30.700 --> 19:37.160
before of the Playstation phone, but they're different. You know, just in the design of

19:37.160 --> 19:41.560
how they are and stuff, they look different. I mean, this is a little bit similar to, like,

19:41.560 --> 19:46.360
the PSP Go, almost. And it does look like a phone. I mean, the slide-out keyboard, you

19:46.360 --> 19:49.880
know, you could almost replace that with a keyboard and be it, you know, just a normal

19:49.880 --> 19:54.120
Sony Ericsson phone. Could it, again, I hate to harp on this, but do you think that maybe

19:54.120 --> 20:00.680
the PSP2 is just this without the phone? Like an iPod touches to an iPhone? Um, possibly.

20:00.680 --> 20:06.200
And that would make sense. I mean, that would be, it would make sense, I would think. Um,

20:06.200 --> 20:10.440
I don't know if it's gonna be, I don't know if I really care for the idea that it has,

20:10.440 --> 20:14.640
like, a touchpad on the back of the device. I mean, I think nowadays you kinda almost

20:14.640 --> 20:18.120
have to have everything as, like, a touch screen, you know. You can pet it and caress

20:18.120 --> 20:22.560
it from the back. Well, it's just. You can literally reach around your PSP and rub it

20:22.560 --> 20:26.880
a little. I just don't understand, I think it would be very awkward to have a touchpad

20:26.880 --> 20:33.120
on the back. I mean, cuz, I don't think that would lend itself well to the games, um, unless

20:33.120 --> 20:37.920
it's just some sort of, you know, context sensitive touchpad or something like that,

20:37.920 --> 20:41.320
in addition to other things. Maybe it knows when you're getting frustrated and you're

20:41.320 --> 20:44.660
about to choke your system. Like, you know how, like, sometimes you'll clench your grip

20:44.660 --> 20:47.720
a little bit when you're getting very angry? And I've been playing a lot of Super Meat

20:47.720 --> 20:53.160
Boy lately, so I'm very familiar with this. Like, rah! Nerd rage! Throw my controller.

20:53.160 --> 20:57.320
Totally go off topic. Super Meat Boy now on the Xbox 360. Do you have any of the downloadable

20:57.320 --> 21:00.960
characters or any additional characters in the game? I've only unlocked one. That's how

21:00.960 --> 21:06.120
terrible I am at it. I can't get the bandages. I have, like, four bandages. I got the guy

21:06.120 --> 21:11.440
that's Bit.Trip Adventure. Oh, okay. Or whoever he is. I have him. He's in one of the warp

21:11.440 --> 21:15.560
zones. I just saw some videos. I think it's PC only, though, of the Minecraft guy. It

21:15.560 --> 21:25.760
is PC only. I'd heard about that, yeah. Talk about cheap. But, yeah, so, I mean, definitely,

21:25.760 --> 21:28.760
there's no question that this is going to be coming out at some point. I think they're

21:28.760 --> 21:32.720
going to announce it at CES because it just makes sense. You know, consumer electronics

21:32.720 --> 21:38.220
show. That's a really good theory is that this is CES and then the PSP2 is E3. Yeah.

21:38.220 --> 21:42.200
That's a really good theory. Because it does seem things with the PSP have been very quiet.

21:42.200 --> 21:48.840
I mean, outside of the Kingdom Hearts and God of War, you know, a couple huge releases.

21:48.840 --> 21:54.160
You know, the Go kind of stopped, pun intended, the PSP chat for a little while. Because the

21:54.160 --> 22:00.360
Go, no matter how Sony or the fans try to spin it, was a miserable failure. There's

22:00.360 --> 22:06.860
not a lot of stuff coming out from Sony for the PSP any time soon. Other than, the only

22:06.860 --> 22:14.760
thing I've seen was Potapon 3. Which, so what? I mean, the second one that you were selling

22:14.760 --> 22:20.960
as a download title. I mean, so, I don't really know if that's a lot to talk about. That could

22:20.960 --> 22:25.040
be the very last game they have in development for the original PSP. It could be just all

22:25.040 --> 22:29.260
now PSP2 stuff. And I don't know if this would actually be marketed as a PSP phone. To me,

22:29.260 --> 22:32.760
it happens to be, I mean, it's not branded as a Sony PlayStation Portable. It's branded

22:32.760 --> 22:38.760
as an Ericsson. Granted, it's a prototype. But, it still strikes me as, oh, it's this

22:38.760 --> 22:46.920
phone that happens to have PSP playing capabilities. Just like, there was that GameCube that was

22:46.920 --> 22:50.520
marketed as a DVD player that happened to play GameCube games. But they didn't call

22:50.520 --> 22:54.400
it a GameCube. The Panasonic Q? Yes, that's right. The Panasonic Q. Thank you. Yeah. That's

22:54.400 --> 22:59.400
what I was trying to think of. Japanese only. Yeah, so, I mean, this is definitely coming.

22:59.400 --> 23:03.480
And it kind of makes sense, because there was also a few patents that they filed from

23:03.480 --> 23:11.780
Sony. It says, you know, some two finger touch devices. And this is saying that there's some

23:11.780 --> 23:19.160
sort of track pad, you know, the rumored track pad on the back of the PSP2. And also possibly,

23:19.160 --> 23:23.800
you know, something that's also that little touch panel thing that's on the front of the

23:23.800 --> 23:28.800
PSP phone. Perhaps this is where this patent comes from. They're saying that it uses a

23:28.800 --> 23:35.240
two fingered touch gestures for data manipulation. And they specified the touch interface may

23:35.240 --> 23:40.320
be separate from the main display. Very similar to what we saw with the PSP2. And they also

23:40.320 --> 23:47.480
said that it's possible that they could have some sort of thing where in the first and

23:47.480 --> 23:54.840
second case portions are slidable, connecting to each other. And where in the visual display

23:54.840 --> 24:02.560
the touch pad disposed of the same side of the case. Or the hell that means. So, I don't

24:02.560 --> 24:08.480
know. It's interesting, though, that they're putting out the... I mean, just based off

24:08.480 --> 24:12.440
what we've seen, I guess it's not making... I would be willing to bet that this thing's

24:12.440 --> 24:15.320
going to have a touch pad on the back for the PSP2. It's going to have a touch pad on

24:15.320 --> 24:20.920
the front for, you know, the PSP phone or whatever. I mean, the stuff that we've heard

24:20.920 --> 24:24.280
over and over again and seen pictures of, I don't think this is going to change all

24:24.280 --> 24:28.600
of a sudden. So, yeah, that's probably what we're going to expect. And if it's coming...

24:28.600 --> 24:32.160
If they're going to announce this at CES, you only have a few more weeks to wait anyways.

24:32.160 --> 24:38.280
I mean, it's mid-January, so... I don't know. It's probably coming. You gotta know they're

24:38.280 --> 24:41.640
pissed about this, though. They are pissed about this video. Oh, come on! Every single

24:41.640 --> 24:49.840
secret that they've had just leaks out! Sony, man, I... They need to do something about

24:49.840 --> 24:55.200
that. Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangehontrady.com. SSJ100Matt, responding to a comment I made

24:55.200 --> 24:59.760
a minute ago, says, Why would I give my PSP a reach around? It never did anything for

24:59.760 --> 25:04.560
me. Never made me a sandwich. That's a good question. AlphaKnanogram says, Eh, I don't

25:04.560 --> 25:09.920
think this phone is the graphical powerhouse the developers are saying the PSP2 will be.

25:09.920 --> 25:14.200
That's true. There was that chatter, I think, that we covered on the show a few weeks ago

25:14.200 --> 25:19.220
from a developer saying, We've seen it and it's a huge graphical powerhouse. So... Which

25:19.220 --> 25:25.080
might explain how they plan to compete with the 3DS by presenting better quality graphics,

25:25.080 --> 25:28.500
perhaps, than what you're going to see in 3D? Because maybe the 3D thing will get old

25:28.500 --> 25:34.360
real quick. Who knows? BlackWolf seems to think that the PSP2 will be at Game Developers

25:34.360 --> 25:39.460
Conference. Might be the better place to debut it. Not a bad thought. Sony is no stranger

25:39.460 --> 25:44.520
to making big announcements at Game Developers Conference. I believe the move was really

25:44.520 --> 25:50.920
shown a lot clearer at this year's Game Developer Conference. And home was originally unveiled

25:50.920 --> 25:55.600
at Game Developers Conference, right? Sounds right. Oh, by the way, totally left that out

25:55.600 --> 25:59.480
of my gaming week. But on a listener's tip, I did try going into home this week and doing

25:59.480 --> 26:06.160
the whole DDR room or whatever. I couldn't even get it to work. I gave up. I threw my

26:06.160 --> 26:12.760
controller into fitter age. Let's see. And then some folks are saying that it was the

26:12.760 --> 26:20.520
Panasonic Q. Or as Frisbee says, the Panasonic QQQ. And lastly, Tigerclaw says, the PSP phone

26:20.520 --> 26:27.940
is just Sony trying to get into the iPhone and Android market for an app gaming perspective.

26:27.940 --> 26:32.960
Maybe trying to expand the Sony App Store or whatever. Trying to get more PS1 game sales

26:32.960 --> 26:39.040
and the cross-platform PSN games you can buy and movies. Because you know this thing will

26:39.040 --> 26:44.280
do everything that the PlayStation Portable already does. Trying to expand the marketplace

26:44.280 --> 26:49.480
potential perhaps? Good thoughts. All right, moving on to another story. We're gonna talk.

26:49.480 --> 26:53.200
This is a little bit of a follow-up to something that had come up last week. Remember when

26:53.200 --> 26:58.320
I mentioned that Harmonix is for sale? Well, sadly, I'm not reporting about a buyer tonight.

26:58.320 --> 27:03.040
But I am saying somebody has said they are out of the picture. And you might be surprised.

27:03.040 --> 27:08.000
It came from an interview with Bloomberg at Bloomberg.com. The CEO of Electronic Arts

27:08.000 --> 27:14.060
John Riccitello actually has said that the company has no interest in pursuing more multimillion

27:14.060 --> 27:18.160
dollar acquisitions for now. The company is gonna focus on better integrating some of

27:18.160 --> 27:22.920
the casual game developers such as Playfish and some of the other casual gaming things.

27:22.920 --> 27:28.340
I mentioned Pogo is a part of that too. Of course, the people asked, are you interested

27:28.340 --> 27:33.840
in Harmonix? And Riccitello said, if we did that, it would, quote, look like I'm doubling

27:33.840 --> 27:38.840
down on yesterday. I'm sure some smart investor will buy the business feeling they can catch

27:38.840 --> 27:43.260
a falling knife. But more people have been cut trying to catch falling knives that have

27:43.260 --> 27:49.320
benefited from getting the timing exactly right. Ouch. I mean, he did also say there

27:49.320 --> 27:53.560
was some nice things about Harmonix and so forth. But he seems to think that the whole

27:53.560 --> 27:59.840
thing is a falling knife. Like, I get that Rock Band 3 didn't sell as much as Rock Band

27:59.840 --> 28:08.840
2, but I think the question that's not really being answered for me is that Harmonix made

28:08.840 --> 28:13.520
this whole Rock Band phenomenon. They made the original Guitar Hero game, remember? They

28:13.520 --> 28:17.080
were working with Activision back then and Red Octane and all that. They made the original

28:17.080 --> 28:23.680
Guitar Hero. They split off to do Rock Band, ABC, and so on. Who's to say Harmonix is not

28:23.680 --> 28:28.880
gonna make the next big thing? That just seems, I mean, I realize you're taking a little bit

28:28.880 --> 28:34.840
of a gamble there, but if there's one thing, there's one thing I could say in the 9, 10

28:34.840 --> 28:39.520
years practically we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio, the developers that take risks

28:39.520 --> 28:43.760
are the ones that get the big payoffs. The ones that just sit there with their thumbs

28:43.760 --> 28:49.760
up their rear making the same old crap year after year, Konami, don't usually get to have

28:49.760 --> 28:51.040
the big payoffs.

28:51.040 --> 28:54.960
Eh, Konami doesn't really do that anymore. Well, okay, with their dancing games.

28:54.960 --> 28:58.360
As far as the music games go and the stuff this show started about, yes, they did for

28:58.360 --> 29:02.720
a very long time. And, granted, they've got some other neat stuff coming out now and they

29:02.720 --> 29:07.900
still have Metal Gear, whatever, but as far as the music game goes, that's how I feel.

29:07.900 --> 29:16.900
To quote the 62nd Ferengi Rule of Acquisition, the riskier the road, the greater the profit.

29:16.900 --> 29:18.600
Hmm.

29:18.600 --> 29:26.600
So, maybe they should be putting the masters of business forward.

29:26.600 --> 29:32.280
Now, BlackWolf in our chat room is saying that the falling knife thing is actually a

29:32.280 --> 29:37.680
misquote and the whole thing is not quite, I'm trying to look at what part of the story

29:37.680 --> 29:42.240
this is in here, he just linked us to something here. I guess he actually came out and said,

29:42.240 --> 29:46.440
I think the music genre is going to recover. I don't know exactly how. It could be based

29:46.440 --> 29:51.480
on some new innovation. Maybe it all becomes dance-based. Well, because we've never seen

29:51.480 --> 29:55.720
the dance thing before. Although, you know, granted there's Dance Central.

29:55.720 --> 30:01.040
He says he likes harmonics and he said, when asked about it yesterday, what I said was

30:01.040 --> 30:05.800
Alex, the co-founder of the studio, is a great developer. Harmonics is one of the great developers

30:05.800 --> 30:09.920
of all time. They've got the leading dance product and maybe the leading game full stop

30:09.920 --> 30:14.880
on Kinect and the question was what investors might be thinking about it. The nervous investor

30:14.880 --> 30:18.760
would be worried about the decline of the music sector feeling like a falling knife.

30:18.760 --> 30:22.660
The only part of that conversation that got reported was the falling knife part. So, he's

30:22.660 --> 30:28.480
saying, I was misquoted. Although, I guess they did use a part that he gave them, but

30:28.480 --> 30:33.360
whatever. He didn't mean to come off as harsh as he did. So, okay, at least I like the fact

30:33.360 --> 30:37.680
that he acknowledges that, you know, harmonics could be also sitting on this big thing here

30:37.680 --> 30:42.920
with Dance Central and I think that's true. So, I don't frown as much as I did, but it

30:42.920 --> 30:48.240
doesn't change the fact that they aren't interested in acquiring harmonics at this time. And even

30:48.240 --> 30:51.820
though maybe falling knife might have been harsh, it seems to be that the motivation

30:51.820 --> 30:58.360
behind that is they don't have that next big thing just right yet, I guess. Although, it

30:58.360 --> 31:02.840
is a little weird because he says Dance Central seems to be a big deal, but I don't want it.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.560
Okay, fair enough.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.560
Fair enough.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.560
Let's move on, Dark Sakura.

31:08.560 --> 31:16.800
Well, for the Doctor Who fans like myself, there will be the last episode for the Doctor

31:16.800 --> 31:22.660
Who the adventure games called Shadows of the Vashta Narada, which, for anyone who doesn't

31:22.660 --> 31:27.840
remember that one, this was the episode where they were stuck in the library and these things

31:27.840 --> 31:32.720
were eating the people and it was the first episode that River Song showed up in. Aww.

31:32.720 --> 31:38.760
But that's your little reminder of who the Vashta Narada were. But it's going to be taking

31:38.760 --> 31:45.360
place during Christmas and will be underwater and you can download it on Christmas Day in

31:45.360 --> 31:50.120
the UK. Well, it's free there. Here, you have to pay five bucks or you can get the whole

31:50.120 --> 31:52.120
season for thirteen.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.120
Hmm. Where can you buy it here in the US?

31:55.120 --> 31:57.120
I would assume the BBC website.

31:57.120 --> 32:03.720
The BBC. This is all paid through the tax money they pay over there for TV, right? That's

32:03.720 --> 32:06.120
how come they don't have to pay anything?

32:06.120 --> 32:10.920
Yeah. And basically, you have to actually pay a television tax, depending, I think,

32:10.920 --> 32:16.680
on your channels. But if you don't pay the taxes, people will come around and go,

32:16.680 --> 32:18.680
okay, you have to pay us and blah, blah, blah.

32:18.680 --> 32:27.080
Hmm. Interesting. The underwater Christmas adventure for Doctor Who. What I think is

32:27.080 --> 32:31.600
interesting about this, because the BBC is kind of paying for these games, right? They're

32:31.600 --> 32:36.240
paying for the development, right? So it's kind of like, you know, it's a very different

32:36.240 --> 32:39.800
– and you have to pardon my ignorance here a little bit, but I've never lived in another

32:39.800 --> 32:46.560
country. All I know is it's very different setup here in America than it is in Britain,

32:46.560 --> 32:52.400
where it's a lot more, I guess you could say, to me, it seems like the BBC is sort

32:52.400 --> 32:58.880
of like their PBS. But over here in America, we think of PBS as the network that plays

32:58.880 --> 33:03.520
classic opera shows and Sesame Street and occasionally video games like that.

33:03.520 --> 33:06.800
I don't think the BBC is.

33:06.800 --> 33:11.560
But what I'm saying, over there, they're actually making this more cutting edge programming.

33:11.560 --> 33:15.480
It's like, imagine if PBS was making the shows Fox was making. That's kind of what

33:15.480 --> 33:19.400
it is. Like it's, I don't know. That's how it strikes me. But my point is, it's

33:19.400 --> 33:25.360
interesting that now we have this whole gaming thing coming out of that, that is part of

33:25.360 --> 33:31.160
the public broadcasting. Yet here, we don't have anything like that. PBS doesn't really

33:31.160 --> 33:34.840
make games. And I think there's been stories on the show before about how there's kind

33:34.840 --> 33:38.720
of been a call for that. Like why do we have the public broadcasting system, but yet we

33:38.720 --> 33:43.920
don't have anything for making games outside of, I don't know, maybe like America's

33:43.920 --> 33:47.920
Army, although that's still the government contracting with somebody else to make that

33:47.920 --> 33:50.640
for recruitment purposes. That's the closest thing I can think of.

33:50.640 --> 34:00.640
Well, just to let you know, the Doctor Who games are actually up on direct2drive.com.

34:00.640 --> 34:04.000
You can just search for them there. But I'm going to put a link to the downloads in the

34:04.000 --> 34:07.560
chat room. I like the point that Tiger Claw is making

34:07.560 --> 34:12.400
in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com. Let's not forget PBS also plays British

34:12.400 --> 34:15.440
shows. The first time I heard Doctor Who was PBS.

34:15.440 --> 34:21.160
Well, that was my introduction to Doctor Who. And when I was little, and I like Star Trek

34:21.160 --> 34:24.360
now, don't get me wrong. But when I was little, I didn't like Star Trek at all. I

34:24.360 --> 34:28.760
was watching Doctor Who, which I thought was a lot cooler and a lot neater because the

34:28.760 --> 34:32.120
concept was neat and it was this crazy old man and all these people running around with

34:32.120 --> 34:37.560
him. And my first doctor was the fourth doctor with Sarah Jane. And she's, to this day,

34:37.560 --> 34:41.060
my favorite companion. She's back in the series. She has her own series and it makes

34:41.060 --> 34:48.920
me happy. But Doctor Who is just awesome. Um, Maji-Nami, Maji-Nami-Khan.

34:48.920 --> 34:56.000
Say Maji-Nami-Khan. Whatever. Maji-Nami-Khan in our chat. I thought that's what I said

34:56.000 --> 35:01.200
before, and I got yelled at for mispronouncing it. Whatever. Says, uh, and yet some political

35:01.200 --> 35:07.160
extremists want to shut down all public broadcasts, radio, TV, et cetera, if I recall correctly.

35:07.160 --> 35:15.160
Yeah, I've heard that too. And, um, I don't know. That, I, I, the thought, the thought

35:15.160 --> 35:20.960
makes me sad because I, when I think of PBS, I think of Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers Neighborhood

35:20.960 --> 35:26.280
and Bob Ross and shows like that, that wouldn't exist without PBS. And it just makes me very

35:26.280 --> 35:30.180
sad. I mean, granted, maybe I haven't yet developed an appreciation for some of the

35:30.180 --> 35:34.560
other stuff they show, like not in the morning or not for children, but I don't know. It

35:34.560 --> 35:39.160
just would be very sad if that were to go away. You know what else PBS gave us? Faulty

35:39.160 --> 35:47.720
Towers for our British television. Red Dwarf. I love Red Dwarf. You know, I watched Keeping

35:47.720 --> 35:53.320
Up Appearances and Are You Being Served and Monty Python's Flying Circus. We need, we

35:53.320 --> 35:59.280
need more of, of, of this on the PBS, but now we have BBC America, I guess. Uh, Gamer

35:59.280 --> 36:03.880
Girl in our chat room says, wait, I'm lost. Why do they want to shut down PBS? Uh, without

36:03.880 --> 36:09.160
getting too political on the show. Um, I, I think it just boils down to that whole,

36:09.160 --> 36:14.160
you're poisoning the public minds with these crazy liberal ideas that PBS gives or whatever,

36:14.160 --> 36:18.600
which is a little bit ludicrous to me. But I think, I think as Dark Soccer referenced,

36:18.600 --> 36:25.340
a lot of it comes back to NPR. And when some people don't like what a public organization

36:25.340 --> 36:32.120
is saying, they want to shut it down, I guess is the best way I can cut it. But there's

36:32.120 --> 36:36.760
a lot of reading between the lines that goes with that stuff too. NPR gets a lot of its

36:36.760 --> 36:47.320
funding too from the Democratic Party and PBS gets funding from political sources. But

36:47.320 --> 36:51.120
I think that, you know, if people want to pay for it, let them pay for it. It's not

36:51.120 --> 36:56.000
your problem. Just don't listen to it. But it's people too busy being right and wanting

36:56.000 --> 37:00.800
others to think just like they do. That's the bottom line.

37:00.800 --> 37:06.920
All right. But I'm not going to go any further than that. I'm just saying people being too

37:06.920 --> 37:10.200
busy being right and wanting other people to think the way they do.

37:10.200 --> 37:15.120
All right. Well, let's, let's talk about something we can all appreciate and that is sales, right

37:15.120 --> 37:18.760
Logie? Oh yes. Of course, Black Friday always means

37:18.760 --> 37:25.400
lots of big sales. And with that, you know, the game companies have to come out and start

37:25.400 --> 37:32.800
waving their cock around, I guess. Connect, of course, sold very well. And they've reached

37:32.800 --> 37:39.040
2.5 million units with the help of Black Friday. And that's worldwide, of course. And of course

37:39.040 --> 37:43.960
that, you know, they break it down. That's a hundred thousand units a day. And that they're

37:43.960 --> 37:53.000
on track to meet their original goal of 5 million units sold this holiday. So that's

37:53.000 --> 37:58.840
pretty awesome, I guess. And I think they've already bypassed the move sales from what

37:58.840 --> 38:07.060
I remember as well. Of course, Nintendo, they're saying that they sold a lot of DS's and Wii's

38:07.060 --> 38:12.480
during Black Friday. It might help that they also had a lot of new colors for different

38:12.480 --> 38:18.200
stuff coming out, new DSi XL colors. I still don't understand why people go crazy about

38:18.200 --> 38:26.880
the colors, but whatever. They had the 25th anniversary red systems, you know, with, what

38:26.880 --> 38:32.180
was it, Mario Kart in there. They also had, you know, the red Wii's, which people are

38:32.180 --> 38:39.080
going crazy over for no apparent reason. And, you know, the orange and green systems with

38:39.080 --> 38:44.760
different games with that. Anyways, they sold 900,000 DS units. And that's, you know, DS,

38:44.760 --> 38:54.360
DS Lite, DS Lite XL. Or DSi's, I guess. And then of course 600,000 Wii's were sold. And

38:54.360 --> 39:01.960
that's during the week of November 21st through the 27th. That's really interesting about,

39:01.960 --> 39:05.640
especially the number of Kinect sales. I mean, I'm hearing more people in the kind of the

39:05.640 --> 39:12.720
mass media, quote unquote, saying that this is, you know, the Wii of this year or this

39:12.720 --> 39:16.040
is one of the must have toys of the year. But it's kind of interesting because I think

39:16.040 --> 39:20.560
when we sat back and saw that, you remember a couple weeks ago, like two or three weeks

39:20.560 --> 39:24.360
ago, Microsoft came out and said we have a goal of selling 5 million units. And we were

39:24.360 --> 39:29.360
like, oh, that's cute. But seeing as you kind of botched your 360 launch by not having the

39:29.360 --> 39:32.900
units available, we kind of, and Nintendo did the same thing, we kind of think you're

39:32.900 --> 39:36.600
gonna do the same thing with Kinect and won't meet that goal. But it looks like the supply

39:36.600 --> 39:41.360
is actually meeting the demand a little bit. In certain markets, of course. Uh huh. How

39:41.360 --> 39:47.240
so? Well, because, you know, the smaller guys obviously aren't getting enough, I'm sure

39:47.240 --> 39:52.360
as hell know we aren't getting enough shipments of that shit. They're sending them all the

39:52.360 --> 40:01.080
retail, those fuckers. So yeah. Well, they obviously are shipping them somewhere because

40:01.080 --> 40:07.400
they're selling those units, so. I don't know. They're still going for a pretty penny though

40:07.400 --> 40:13.920
on eBay, that's for sure. Alright. Really? How much, what's the reseller market look

40:13.920 --> 40:17.360
like on that? Because I remember with some of those things, oh my gosh. It's usually

40:17.360 --> 40:23.420
50 to 100 dollars of retail. And they're going pretty good. Wow. Alright, well let's get

40:23.420 --> 40:30.120
into a big story from this week. I don't know. And Loki asked me before the show, why are

40:30.120 --> 40:34.320
we reporting on this? And I don't know, but I think the response to this is kind of funny.

40:34.320 --> 40:38.480
So let me tell you what's going on. PETA decided to parody another game this week. You know,

40:38.480 --> 40:41.640
they've done some video game parodies. They had like, I think there was like a Super Mario

40:41.640 --> 40:46.380
Brothers parody and some of the crap too. But Super Meat Boy was the last game they

40:46.380 --> 40:52.040
set their eyes on and they decided to make this parody called Super Tofu Boy. And Super

40:52.040 --> 40:58.220
Tofu Boy is, you know, you play a chunk of tofu instead of a chunk of meat. They've made

40:58.220 --> 41:04.140
Super Meat Boy the enemy in the game. Quote, Meat Boy is a vengeful, bloody cube of rotting

41:04.140 --> 41:10.200
animal flesh and he smells. After a short-lived fling with Bandage Girl, he became enraged

41:10.200 --> 41:14.920
when he was dumped for the tasty and satisfying Tofu Boy, etcetera, etcetera. That's the blabber

41:14.920 --> 41:20.480
setup from the PETA game website. And the gameplay is, it's fairly similar to Super

41:20.480 --> 41:26.000
Meat Boy, but it's, you know, obviously a cheap hack. Well, actually I shouldn't say

41:26.000 --> 41:31.400
a cheap hack. It's, considering how fast this must have turned around, it's a pretty decent

41:31.400 --> 41:35.480
hack, dare I say it. But whoever they've got programming the games at PETA seems to be

41:35.480 --> 41:42.200
pretty talented like it or not. Anyway, the point is, Super Meat Boy came out and responded

41:42.200 --> 41:49.360
to the whole Super Tofu Boy thing and with this tweet that's really, ouch, they made

41:49.360 --> 41:55.200
a tweet. How many PETA members does it take to change a light bulb? None. PETA can't change

41:55.200 --> 41:59.640
anything. But I'm bummed. That was pretty much their response to the whole thing. Not

41:59.640 --> 42:03.600
quite just that though. If you read some of the other follow-up tweets and so on, apparently

42:03.600 --> 42:09.260
the guy who made Super Meat Boy went on to the PETA forums and posted under some different

42:09.260 --> 42:13.960
names to try to call attention to the game to, I guess, basically get free promotion

42:13.960 --> 42:19.920
and it worked. That's the crazy part. I don't know if he's making that up in retrospect,

42:19.920 --> 42:24.200
but I don't see why not. I think that's actually kind of a smart thing to do. Like, oh my God,

42:24.200 --> 42:28.880
can you believe they're making this game out of a moving piece of meat and glamorizing

42:28.880 --> 42:35.000
meat and meat is murder. So, I think that's kind of funny. Tasty, tasty murder. I think

42:35.000 --> 42:41.320
it's really funny that it worked in so many ways. So anyway, now they've come out and

42:41.320 --> 42:47.000
said, well, since we were able to get basically free advertisement for Super Meat Boy, we're

42:47.000 --> 42:52.720
going to put Super Tofu Boy as an unlockable character in the PC version of the game. So

42:52.720 --> 43:01.200
they came out and tweeted, if you type PETA file, P-E-T-A-P-H-I-L-E, at the character

43:01.200 --> 43:06.520
select screen, you will be able to play as Super Tofu Boy. Wow, and I even made that

43:06.520 --> 43:11.600
joke earlier. I had no idea. PETA file. Imagine on the con says in here, the funny thing is

43:11.600 --> 43:15.640
that by Super Meat Boy creators' own admission, Meat Boy is a normal person without skin,

43:15.640 --> 43:22.640
not a hunk of meat. Way to screw up, PETA. It's just a game for heaven's sake. And again,

43:22.640 --> 43:28.200
I love Super Meat Boy. It's a great arcade game. I really think it's only drawback is

43:28.200 --> 43:34.280
this whole like, what? It's a piece of meat? Like I don't, that's your mark. What? That's

43:34.280 --> 43:38.960
the artwork? Really? That's the name of your game, Super Meat Boy? But whatever, I didn't

43:38.960 --> 43:43.360
make it. People probably say the same thing about Orange Lounge Radio. Why the hell do

43:43.360 --> 43:46.720
you call your video game show Orange Lounge Radio? You're not about oranges. You're not

43:46.720 --> 43:51.400
about Orange County. Frisbee makes a very good point and this is very true. PETA, we

43:51.400 --> 43:55.880
euthanize more animals than we take in even though we don't support euthanization. It's

43:55.880 --> 43:59.640
true. I mean, they actually have to report all of this stuff to the IRS. It's a matter

43:59.640 --> 44:05.120
of public record. By the way, Edmund McMillan, who is the co-creator of the game, he admitted

44:05.120 --> 44:10.160
that he made fake usernames in PETA's forum pushing the game at them in hopes that something

44:10.160 --> 44:15.120
would happen. PETA is 1000 times more well known than Super Meat Boy and the fact that

44:15.120 --> 44:18.760
they went out of their way to make a parody like this is beyond flattery and amazingly

44:18.760 --> 44:24.080
helpful. Edmund McMillan has said he was once a vegetarian and has worked as an animal control

44:24.080 --> 44:30.560
officer and he disagrees with PETA's total stance against the lab testing of animals

44:30.560 --> 44:35.800
and this is so interesting. He's saying that being against the lab testing of animals means

44:35.800 --> 44:40.680
you're against these medical discoveries and treatments that save lives like his mom who

44:40.680 --> 44:46.400
is diabetic and that's why he's against PETA. The person right under the PETA lady, Ingrid

44:46.400 --> 44:55.240
Newkirk, is a diabetic who is on insulin made from dog testing. Interesting. I know, right?

44:55.240 --> 45:00.880
Fun double standard, right? Anyway, why is it that this show keeps coming back to politics

45:00.880 --> 45:04.880
tonight? I don't know, but I just found it very interesting that an author of a game

45:04.880 --> 45:10.900
trolled the PETA forums and got his way. That's outstanding to me. I just hope it's not one

45:10.900 --> 45:15.900
of those hindsight is 20-20 things. PETA is a cult! Alright, let's move on to another

45:15.900 --> 45:19.160
video game story and then we're going to get into a whole other cult, the Techno Kitten

45:19.160 --> 45:25.720
Adventure cult. I'm very excited to get there. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Well,

45:25.720 --> 45:34.560
you know that pretty pretty pretty song that we've been listening to for Civ 4? I should

45:34.560 --> 45:37.320
try to sing it because it's much prettier than I'm giving it credit for. I could play

45:37.320 --> 45:47.240
a little clip. Not right now. It's been nominated for a Grammy. It's under best instrumental

45:47.240 --> 45:52.460
arrangement accompanying vocalist category from the composer's debut album, Calling

45:52.460 --> 46:00.580
All Dawns. It's a really pretty song, I mean, it's been going around since they've included

46:00.580 --> 46:08.000
it with the video games live. It's gorgeous, I really think it is, so I hope that they

46:08.000 --> 46:24.080
win. Here's a little clip. It's kind of quiet, sorry guys. Civ 4 really did have this epic

46:24.080 --> 46:29.200
theme song to it, which obviously is this, and then Civ 5 just pales in comparison. I

46:29.200 --> 46:32.440
mean, Civ 5 is a great game, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't really have quite the

46:32.440 --> 46:38.320
moving song that Civ 4 did, so I'm happy to see that a video game song gets acknowledged

46:38.320 --> 46:43.760
with a Grammy nomination, but here's the weird thing to me. Civ 4 didn't come out this year,

46:43.760 --> 46:49.280
so it is not getting nominated because it's from Civ 4. It's getting nominated because

46:49.280 --> 46:52.700
Christopher Tin ended up making an album that happened to come out in the past year that

46:52.700 --> 46:57.320
has this song on it. So you wonder, well, did it get nominated because people knew the

46:57.320 --> 47:01.920
song already? But Civ 4 is, what, a four or five year old game. It wasn't nominated for

47:01.920 --> 47:06.480
a Grammy four or five years ago. 2005, was it? Yeah. So it's kind of interesting that

47:06.480 --> 47:10.400
it took this long, and you've got to wonder that, oh, well, maybe people knew about it

47:10.400 --> 47:16.160
from here? Who knows. Black Wolf in our chat room wants to point out that Christopher Tin,

47:16.160 --> 47:23.080
the album, was also nominated. So no matter how people found it, and if you actually listen

47:23.080 --> 47:27.800
to the rest of the album itself, it is a really good album. You know, it's not pop or rock,

47:27.800 --> 47:33.320
it's very different. It's a world kind of more, I don't want to say Enya, but more of

47:33.320 --> 47:40.640
that, it's PBS music, actually. And that's not a bad thing. So also I like Akuma JP in

47:40.640 --> 47:43.680
our chat room says Lion King. It does kind of sound like the theme of the Lion King,

47:43.680 --> 47:47.640
does it a little bit? A little less Elton John, though? It sounds like the freaking

47:47.640 --> 47:52.360
Avatar soundtrack. Does it? I've never really listened to the Avatar soundtrack. Is it that

47:52.360 --> 47:57.640
good? I like it. I thought it had really pretty music in it, but it's the same type of, the

47:57.640 --> 48:02.880
same theme. All right, well, I promised you guys that we were going to have an interview

48:02.880 --> 48:10.040
tonight. So we are going to give Nick a call. He is the creator of Techno Kitten Adventure.

48:10.040 --> 48:14.320
And I'm really excited to talk to him about the game and how he got on the, how we got

48:14.320 --> 48:17.840
him on the show and everything. So we're calling him right now. This is totally live and unscripted.

48:17.840 --> 48:23.640
Anything could happen, guys. If you have questions, post them in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

48:23.640 --> 48:27.880
While we wait for him to pick up. Wouldn't it be funny if this went to voicemail? Like,

48:27.880 --> 48:34.320
oops, I forgot. Hello? Hi, is this Nick? Yep. Hi, this is Rob with Orange Lounge Radio.

48:34.320 --> 48:38.920
How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? Good. You are on the air on our lovely show

48:38.920 --> 48:43.080
here that we do every Sunday night. And I want to talk to you a little bit about Techno

48:43.080 --> 48:49.460
Kitten Adventure, your game for the Xbox 360. So I don't know if you know, but we had a

48:49.460 --> 48:54.560
listener tweet us about this last week. We had no idea that the game was out there. But

48:54.560 --> 48:59.920
our show was kind of founded on the games like Dance Dance Revolution and BeatMania

48:59.920 --> 49:05.280
2DX. So we're definitely no stranger to happy hardcore. And of course we love kittens. Who

49:05.280 --> 49:11.720
doesn't? So this game kind of seemed to be almost the perfect game in a way. So we have

49:11.720 --> 49:19.240
to know, what inspired Techno Kitten Adventure, Nick? Well, I recently discovered happy hardcore,

49:19.240 --> 49:27.480
which is the greatest genre of all time. And I played Robot Unicorn Attack a while ago.

49:27.480 --> 49:32.800
And that kind of gave the idea to incorporate music into a game. But Robot Unicorn Attack

49:32.800 --> 49:37.920
didn't really have everything going to the music. It was more like a background sort

49:37.920 --> 49:45.800
of thing. And also, I like kittens, as you said. Who doesn't? So I wanted to incorporate

49:45.800 --> 49:50.000
all three things into one. And that's what I came up with. Is this the first game you've

49:50.000 --> 49:53.800
ever made? Or do you have other XNA games out there? Or was this like your first adventure?

49:53.800 --> 49:59.120
I have a few more games out there. Some of them are not very good. One of the better

49:59.120 --> 50:06.640
ones is Physics Sandbox 2. It's kind of like Crayon Physics Deluxe. I don't know if you

50:06.640 --> 50:11.160
played that. I have. It was on Steam. Well, I'm sure it's still there. But yes, I have

50:11.160 --> 50:16.080
played that. Very cool. Yeah, it's a lot like that. It's for Xbox. You've done other games.

50:16.080 --> 50:21.680
How long did this game take you to make Techno Kitten Adventure? Um, a summer. I didn't really

50:21.680 --> 50:26.480
spend too much time on it, though. Most of the time when it's actually licensing the

50:26.480 --> 50:30.560
music. Okay, that was the next thing I had to ask you about. Because you didn't make

50:30.560 --> 50:36.200
or write a song specifically for this game. You somehow licensed an existing song that's

50:36.200 --> 50:41.280
out there, right? Tell me how you got the song and found the song and got the song in

50:41.280 --> 50:48.000
the game, ultimately. Well, I'd heard the song before, like a trans version. And then

50:48.000 --> 50:54.120
I discovered the Happy Hardcore version, which is from a company in the UK. Pretty popular

50:54.120 --> 51:01.120
over there, but non-existent in the US. So I just contacted them and paid a fee and got

51:01.120 --> 51:06.000
to use it for the game. Nice. And that song, of course, is Frisco with Sea of Love is the

51:06.000 --> 51:11.200
song. Now, I don't know if you're allowed to tell us, so you can pass on this question

51:11.200 --> 51:20.680
if you want, but do they get a cut of the profits because you used the song? That's

51:20.680 --> 51:27.280
alright. What are the possibilities? Let me back up a little bit. How successful has this

51:27.280 --> 51:31.760
game been for you? I know you're only charging a dollar for it, but I also noticed it was

51:31.760 --> 51:36.520
in the top 50 indie games, which has got to be a hard place to get to. So has this game

51:36.520 --> 51:41.480
been pretty successful for you, money-wise? It's actually been less successful than my

51:41.480 --> 51:47.120
other games. Really? For an offer. But I think they were a lot more appropriate for the audience

51:47.120 --> 51:55.640
that goes to indie games, which seems to be like 13-year-olds. Hey, wait a minute! Wait

51:55.640 --> 52:01.840
a minute! Alright, so it hasn't been as successful to share the games. That's really interesting,

52:01.840 --> 52:05.640
but definitely there's been an audience for it. I mean, do you plan to do anything else

52:05.640 --> 52:13.840
with this idea? We are going to port it to Windows Phone 7, iPhone, and Android probably

52:13.840 --> 52:20.760
within the next three months. You said we. Is there a whole team behind it? Well, I'm

52:20.760 --> 52:25.960
working with another company right now. We're going to redo the art, most of it. Probably

52:25.960 --> 52:32.240
add some new effects. I see. So did somebody find your game there and was like, we want

52:32.240 --> 52:36.480
to work with you on this a little bit? I'm guessing it's got something. Yeah. Okay. I'll

52:36.480 --> 52:42.840
get it on my phone. I was going to say, not bad for a bunch of 13-year-olds. One of them

52:42.840 --> 52:47.320
has got their own company somewhere that's going to help you out. What about, you know

52:47.320 --> 52:51.920
I've got to ask about a potential sequel to Techno Kitten Adventure? Is there a Techno

52:51.920 --> 52:56.240
Kitten Adventure 2 in the works? Electric Booboo? I don't know. The company that contacted

52:56.240 --> 53:01.240
me said that, depending on how well it does, they'll probably think about making a sequel.

53:01.240 --> 53:05.440
I don't know if it'll be the same genre of music. For me, I'd like it to be some more

53:05.440 --> 53:10.080
happy hardcore, but we'll see. It'll probably be a different genre. Well, this could be

53:10.080 --> 53:14.800
like the whole new Dance Dance Revolution where you can have a whole soundtrack of music

53:14.800 --> 53:18.600
to pick from for the different levels. But I imagine it's got to be kind of a pain to

53:18.600 --> 53:22.760
sync up all those songs. You know, part of the charm that people are noticing of the

53:22.760 --> 53:27.680
game is the way that the background kind of syncs to the song. Where did you kind of get

53:27.680 --> 53:32.880
the idea to do that? Some of the syncing that you do in the game? Well, I started off just

53:32.880 --> 53:37.200
wanting to make the Helicopter Clone and then having hardcore playing in the background

53:37.200 --> 53:42.840
kind of make it like robot unicorn attack. And then while I was doing that, I made a

53:42.840 --> 53:47.200
few effects on accident that worked really well with the music. So I decided to have

53:47.200 --> 53:56.360
everything sync up with it, which took listening to the song a few hundred times, unfortunately.

53:56.360 --> 54:01.120
But you love happy hardcore, so it's okay, right? Yeah, it's actually still a good song.

54:01.120 --> 54:06.400
It is one of those rare songs that kind of works for a game like this. And I think part

54:06.400 --> 54:09.800
of what made robot unicorn attack is that that erasure song kind of worked really well

54:09.800 --> 54:14.240
for that game. But then they tried to do, there was like a robot unicorn attack metal

54:14.240 --> 54:17.280
version or something, wasn't there, Loki? Yeah. You were talking about? And it wasn't

54:17.280 --> 54:21.640
as good. It wasn't nearly as good. I liked it, but then the Christmas one, that's just

54:21.640 --> 54:26.520
jumping the shark right there. So you gotta be careful, Nick, not to jump the shark. So

54:26.520 --> 54:31.360
enjoy this. I played the metal version. It sucked pretty bad. Thank you. Unless you do

54:31.360 --> 54:38.280
a techno shark. Techno sharks with lasers adventures. Alright, I got a couple more questions

54:38.280 --> 54:42.880
for you. And that is, are you thinking though, you know, I know you got the company that

54:42.880 --> 54:46.720
wants to do other things with this title and so forth. Do you think maybe you're going

54:46.720 --> 54:50.360
to do another game that really has nothing to do with this whatsoever? Like this is just

54:50.360 --> 54:54.280
kind of a one off thing and you have other games you want to do or do you want to kind

54:54.280 --> 54:58.560
of play this out and see where it goes? Right now I'm working on a music based shoot-em-up,

54:58.560 --> 55:05.000
which is going to be way more gameplay based rather than a simple one button game. Ah,

55:05.000 --> 55:08.360
very cool. Do you want to, anything else you can say about that right now or is it all

55:08.360 --> 55:14.400
still in the works? Um, it's pretty much going to be a music visualizer going in the background

55:14.400 --> 55:18.920
and then just really hardcore shoot-em-up, crap load of bullets, bullet hole sort of

55:18.920 --> 55:23.120
thing. Awesome. That sounds like it could be pretty awesome. We do have a lot of cave

55:23.120 --> 55:26.480
shooter fans. That's true. I had to listen to this show. We have a lot of music game

55:26.480 --> 55:29.400
fans. We have a lot of cave shooter fans. So I think there's going to be definitely

55:29.400 --> 55:33.060
an audience. This is a very small audience, trust me, but there's an audience out there

55:33.060 --> 55:38.720
for it. So, best of luck with all of that. One other question I want to ask you about

55:38.720 --> 55:42.280
and that is about their reaction, you know, to something like this. Because when something

55:42.280 --> 55:47.400
like this goes viral, quote unquote, you read a lot of interesting things on the internet

55:47.400 --> 55:52.120
about the game. Do you ever Google Technokit and adventure to kind of see what comes up

55:52.120 --> 55:55.400
or see what people are saying on the internet about your game? Or are you one of those people

55:55.400 --> 56:02.400
that's like, I don't care? I look at it quite a bit actually. Yeah, what do you think? Um,

56:02.400 --> 56:07.920
a lot of people like it and then others just haters gonna hate. Absolutely right. Oh my

56:07.920 --> 56:12.800
god, that's my slogan I've said on the show before. Haters gonna hate. Absolutely. I agree.

56:12.800 --> 56:15.640
Haters gonna hate. What's the worst thing you've read about Technokit and adventure?

56:15.640 --> 56:19.820
Because I want to know, who can hate on a cat? Who can hate on a flying cat? What's

56:19.820 --> 56:24.960
the worst thing you've read about Technokit and adventure? Um, most of them just say that

56:24.960 --> 56:30.700
it looks like it was made in MS Paint. I haven't really read anything that horrified me. Haters

56:30.700 --> 56:35.460
to the left. Haters to the left. You know what? I kind of think the art style in a way

56:35.460 --> 56:41.280
is kind of part of the charm. Like, if it had been all like 3D, HD, Uber effects, I

56:41.280 --> 56:49.160
don't think it would really be the same thing. That makes sense? So, I say, you go. And good

56:49.160 --> 56:53.960
luck with all those future projects. Anything else you want to plug here on our little show?

56:53.960 --> 56:57.760
Of upcoming projects or what have you? No thanks. Alright. Well the game, you have a

56:57.760 --> 57:02.200
website or anything official website for? Not at the moment. There should be a website

57:02.200 --> 57:06.440
in the works though. Alright. Well then, we'll let you guys know about it when Nick tells

57:06.440 --> 57:11.320
us about it. The game is Technokit and Adventure and it is available at Technokit and Adventures

57:11.320 --> 57:17.400
excuse me. And it's available right now on the Xbox Live Indie Games. It's one whole

57:17.400 --> 57:24.080
dollar. Which is really not a bad price at all. It's the cost of a taco. As I said earlier

57:24.080 --> 57:30.080
in the show, well technically on Sundays it's the cost of three tacos. A taco is for a moment

57:30.080 --> 57:35.760
but Technokittens are forever. That's right. And as I was saying earlier in the show, I

57:35.760 --> 57:39.640
also played Poker Night at the inventory this week which was five dollars. And I played

57:39.640 --> 57:44.920
more Technokitten Adventure. So I think it was the better deal. So there you go. Alright.

57:44.920 --> 57:47.560
Well Nick, thank you so much for being on our show. Really appreciate it. And best of

57:47.560 --> 57:51.520
luck with your future projects. Thanks for having me. But don't make a metal version.

57:51.520 --> 57:58.560
I will. Alright, thank you. Have a good night. Bye. I love it. From tweet to call on the

57:58.560 --> 58:03.920
show, Technokitten Adventure. Nick from Technokitten Adventure. He didn't tell me his last name

58:03.920 --> 58:08.440
but we'll give him a little bit of anonymity. It's not real ID here on the show after all.

58:08.440 --> 58:12.720
Thanks to Nick for being such a good sport. And the Zominar chatroom says if you have

58:12.720 --> 58:18.760
two dollars, you can have Technokittens and a taco. I don't know. In this economy, in

58:18.760 --> 58:28.640
this economy, it might be tough. And that's value! Alright. Anyhow, let's move on to more

58:28.640 --> 58:31.640
stories. Actually release dates. It's time for it to get to the show. So if you don't

58:31.640 --> 58:34.920
want to get Technokitten Adventure or you've already bought it and you want to look at

58:34.920 --> 58:38.840
other games, there's other stuff coming to a store near you, right, Loki? Yes, and this

58:38.840 --> 58:43.200
will probably be the last week that stuff will be coming to a store near you, at least

58:43.200 --> 58:50.080
this year, because it is dying down to zero. I mean, literally I think the week after next,

58:50.080 --> 58:56.360
there's one game. And the week after that, possibly another game. And that's it. But

58:56.360 --> 59:01.520
yeah, next week though, to kind of coincide with it, it's a little bit early, with the

59:01.520 --> 59:08.320
launch of the new Tron movie, Tron Evolution. It's going to be kind of a prequel to Tron

59:08.320 --> 59:15.320
Legacy, and that'll be coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360. Fuck yeah. And then they're going

59:15.320 --> 59:25.160
to be doing kind of an arena-based sort of combat game. It's Tron Legacy Battle Grid,

59:25.160 --> 59:30.200
and that's coming out on the Wii. Oh, and I guess it's also on PC as well. So definitely

59:30.200 --> 59:35.560
check that out, that looks pretty exciting. Oh, and then the Tron Battle Grid, I believe

59:35.560 --> 59:44.440
is also on DS, and possibly PSP. SBKX Superbike World Championship on Playstation 3, and I

59:44.440 --> 59:50.720
believe Xbox 360 as well. And that's going to be kind of a street bike racing game. Yogi

59:50.720 --> 59:58.440
Bear, the video game. And that's... Right? I hope that movie tanks. But sadly there's

59:58.440 --> 01:00:02.840
kids that are going to want to see it. You know, kind of a bit of a side note here. I

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.760
actually got an invite, and I can't go to it. Well, let me put it this way, I'm not

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:15.240
going to it. For a Nielsen screening of a summer movie that's coming out next year,

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.360
and it's a computer-animated comedy. You know what happens to be sitting in the middle of

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:27.600
summer as a computer-animated comedy? Smurfs the movie. Oh no. Fuck no. Oh, so they don't

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.180
tell you what the movie is? They don't tell me what the movie is. Oh, but you should go

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:36.960
see it just to poop on it. No, because Nellie's like, if you leave me with the baby all night

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:44.840
long to go see Smurfs the movie, I'm going to kill you. That's fair. That is fair. Honestly,

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:51.040
I'm not going to risk the fact that it possibly might be Smurfs the movie, so I'm not going.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:56.120
Sniper Elite coming out on the Wii, looks like a pretty generic sniper game. Which might

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.240
work a lot better combined with the Smurfs movie and Yogi Bear. You know that they will

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:07.200
be making a Smurfs game, I will have you know. Okay, not to get too tangenty, but I've had

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:13.840
not one, but several friends tell me that the Smurf village game on the phone, iPhone,

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:21.060
which is by Capcom, is actually really good for the whole like Wii rule, Farmville-y,

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.800
you know, Facebook-y type of game on your phone. No, I'm not touching that game. I saw

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.480
it and I was like, you know, I could download it for free and check it out and see if it's

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.520
any good. No, I'm not even going to check it out to see if it's any good. I'm sorry.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:37.200
The only Smurfs game I've played and will only play is the one on the ColecoVision.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.360
Yeah, absolutely. That's the one where you can get her naked. Smurfette naked. There's

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.960
a bug. You go backwards or something instead of going forwards at the very end and there's

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:52.280
a bug where Smurfette gets naked. I have this game. Really? I have a ColecoVision in the

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.040
game. I played Smurfs, like, cause I used to, when I was like four or five years old,

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.520
I was a huge fan of the Smurfs. I have to tell you this, I have to tell you this. Becky

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:06.100
just told me, Julian and I saw the preview for Yogi Bear and he said it looked stupid

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:11.400
and he's three and a half. I think Julian should be the official movie critic of Orange

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.640
Ons Radio. What do you think? I agree. He's the official child of Orange Ons Radio. During

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:23.760
Tron, they're going to have the new Transformers 3 trailers. Okay, this other game coming out,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.760
the Touchmaster. Wait, wait, hold on, sorry. This is really important though, okay? It

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.800
was on the Atari 2600 and the ColecoVision. The ColecoVision version of Smurf, Rescue

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.000
and Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg or programming error. Upon reaching Smurfette's

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.960
screen, the player can return to the previous screen. Just before the screen changes, it

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.680
will appear as though the top of Smurfette's dress comes off, making her appear topless.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.800
Two of the background music tracks are simple, you know, whatever, who cares about the music.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.160
So yes, Smurfette gets topless if you go backwards. If you leave her ass, she'll show her titties

01:02:54.160 --> 01:03:01.080
to get you to come back. Awesome. Sorry, Loki. It was worth reporting. Yeah, it was worth

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.080
reporting. You know when she made She Was Evil? Touchmaster Connect, it's all those

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:11.980
wonderful bar games that they have. What makes it unique compared to some of the other ones,

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:16.960
you can share your scores via Twitter and Facebook using this DS title. So, that's kind

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:24.360
of neat I guess. Yu-Gi-Oh! 50's Dual Transer coming out on the Wii. And how can we not

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:30.080
forget World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the new expansion coming out on PC. Hey, what did

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:38.520
Nick say, DarkSagra? Haters gonna hate. No barfing over there. Also, let's see. Bejeweled

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:48.520
3 on PC. That's pretty awesome. New You Fitness First Yoga and Pilates on the Wii. And then,

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:52.560
sorry, I must have had something on my throat there. And then finally, a week from today,

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:57.280
Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition for the Wii. It's just a Super Nintendo game!

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.720
Seriously, are you gonna pay Nintendo? They did nothing to the game other than make it

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:12.880
work with the controls. And you're gonna pay them $30? Alright. If that's what you really

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.200
want. But it comes in a shiny box. You know what kind of a message you're sending to Nintendo.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:23.240
You can buy anything that you sell. And then it's gonna be remade in 3D and be $35 on the

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.680
3DS. Wait. Wait for it. There's better ROM hacks out there. I mean, what was it? New

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:33.840
Super Mario Bros. 3. Remember that? The whole, they completely re-edited the levels for the

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.600
DS version to Super Mario Bros. 3 and bonus levels and added all these challenge maps

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.620
and stuff? See, that's a value right there. They put that on a cartridge, I'd buy that

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:48.600
shit in no time, but I'm sorry. They did nothing. They didn't even try to make it new. By the

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.680
way, since you flew by Bejeweled 3, which I think will actually be a big seller because

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.640
those PopCap games do very well. Zuma Blitz is a game I actually played this week because

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.920
they have the whole beta thing or whatever. It's not very hard to get into. On Facebook,

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:07.400
it's a Facebook game. It's Zuma in a Minute. It's actually pretty good. It's pretty addicting.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:13.120
And you know, it's free. They have their whole like, you can buy things to unlock more special

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.540
blah blah blahs. But as far as the whole like competing with your friends for high scores

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:21.440
and so on, you know, it's cool. It's just like the Bejeweled one. Or here's something

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:26.360
even better. And yes, I know that the stuff is already available on, you know, the Virtual

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.800
Console and stuff like that. Why? I mean, they've got a whole damn disc. I can tell

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.160
you right now that this image of this disc is probably going to be like a few megs. And

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.880
that's it. And the rest is just all blank space or filler or whatever. I mean, why didn't

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:47.160
they put like Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2 on there? Maybe Mario 64. You know,

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.480
make it worthwhile. And hell, you could even charge, you know, 50 bucks for it at that

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:58.440
point. Because it's, you know, full of all the Mario games. But no, there's Mario All-Stars.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.960
Maybe there's an unlockable. No, there's not an unlockable. Yeah, there'll be an unlockable

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:09.760
alright and guess what it'll be? Demos. Virtual Console demos. Hey, you like these games?

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:15.080
You can give them their original form on the Virtual Console. Anything else for this week,

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:19.360
Doki? Ah, that's it. Alright, let's go to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.000
On the Xbox 360, Japan gets their version of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood this week.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.880
Also, Kinect Animals in a regular and limited edition. A price reduction on End of Eternity,

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.580
but a new game Need for Speed Hot Pursuit over there in Japan and Your Shape Fitness

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:37.240
Evolved. Looks like some of those Kinect games took a little bit longer to localize, but

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.440
they're finally making their way over to Japan. On the PlayStation 3, also Assassin's Creed

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.440
Brotherhood. Price reduction on End of Eternity, a game called Free Free Bowling, which I'm

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:53.840
thinking is the Move bowling game localized for Japan, and a USB Neo Geo pad from SNK

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:59.680
Play More comes out this week. It is basically a Neo Geo pad with six buttons for fighting

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:04.680
games, probably for use with some of the Neo Geo games that are on PlayStation Network.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:10.680
Going over to the Nintendo Wii this week in Japan, Donkey Kong Returns makes its way out.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.560
Uh, for once, we got a game about a week before they did. Fitness Party also comes out from

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:23.720
Namco Bandai, and a karaoke game called Karaoke Joy Sound Wii Super DX Hitori de Mina de Utai

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:29.760
Hodai comes out from Hudson this week. That is a hell of a name there. The name doesn't

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:36.720
quite make sense to me. Hitori de Mina, that's like, okay. It looks a little bit like Karaoke

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:42.080
Revolution meets once in a while the actual music video, but otherwise it's party girls

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:47.160
dancing on a stage. Like, I don't even, I can't even. Is there Para Para? There's no

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.680
Para Para. Not worth it. How about Pac-Man Party? That is also coming out in Japan this

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:56.120
week, and Boom Blocks gets a price reduction in Japan. Oops, sorry, that's the 16th, that's

01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:01.640
next week. Sorry. So let me keep going with this week on the Nintendo DS. Castlevania

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:06.840
Dawn of Sorrow gets a price reduction, so does Ganbare Goemon. As far as new games though,

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:12.440
one of the ones you might want to check out is Ninokuni Shikoku no Madoushi comes out

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:20.440
this week. This is, it's an RPG from level 5 and, dammit, I think this is out here in

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:25.560
the US as something else and I can't tell what it is. But it's an RPG from level 5 in

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.000
Japan, I'm sure somebody in the chatroom will correct me soon enough. There's actually an

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.400
official website for it. Should I look at it real quick? I think this is a pretty big

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:38.640
DS title. Maybe somebody in chat knows the rest. As far as the Sony PSP goes, not a lot

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.200
of big stuff this week, although there's some price reductions on things like Valkyria Chronicles

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:51.040
2 and Kuroganni no Lene Barrels, Hudson the best. Oh, you know what this game is? I believe

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:57.000
this is the DS game that's made with Studio Ghibli. That's what this is. Cause the artwork

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.200
looks very, very, uh, like that. I think that's what this is. So I don't think it is out here

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.360
in the US, but I think I've read about it, that's why it sounds familiar to me. Yeah,

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.800
look at this, this looks like Studio Ghibli, doesn't it? With the little guy with the lantern

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.480
on his nose and everything? That's gotta be what this is. Nice. No other studio puts lanterns

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:21.320
on noses. No, no other studio would do that. There we go, thank you, chatroom's jumping

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.280
in there saying yes to Studio Ghibli, it's the one with the huge 300 page magic book,

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.840
that is Dungeon Buster. Thank you. I figured it out eventually. Alright, Dark Sakura, how

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:36.720
about the UK? In the UK we have a number of games, although not many. On the 7th is Alien

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:43.460
Breed 2 Assault and Bejeweled 3 and World of Warcraft Cataclysm, sorry. Hater. I'm not.

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:50.120
On the 8th is Bomberman Live Battlefest. And then on the 10th we have Cave Story and Golden

01:09:50.120 --> 01:10:00.200
Sun Dark Dawn. Oooh. Alright. And that's about it. Alright, not a bad week all things considered,

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.920
I mean considering we're getting really close to Christmas, I mean, whether Dark Sakura

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.600
likes it or not, Warcraft's gonna be a huge game, and hey, there's Tron, and there's...

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:14.440
I don't give a crap about Wordcraft or Warcraft. I mean, to be honest, I just do it to give

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.720
you a hard time. There's Plants vs Zombies is in it now, that's all I'm saying. I just

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.080
like giving you a hard time about it. I know you do. Mwah, mwah, mwah. A couple more news

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:30.840
stories for you guys. I'm a Vice Admiral. And then the classic game of the week. Yes.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:35.840
So this is kinda cool. You know, and they were talking about possibly making a game

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:40.920
based on this, but now it's been confirmed that Christopher Nolan is actually working

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:47.560
on an Inception video game. And I think that's really cool. Love the world of Inception.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:53.600
Love the movie. I still haven't seen it. But it comes out on Blu-ray this week, so I plan

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.160
to rent it. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Do not watch anything else. Because I'm sitting

01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:01.760
here going, all I know is that there's a room spinny thing that might be cool in a video

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.000
game, but otherwise I don't know why this would make a good video game. Can you tell

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.120
me why this is gonna be an awesome video game without spoiling the movie? Okay, think of

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:17.680
it, it's like, it'd be like why the, except, you know, the MMO sucked, like The Matrix,

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.360
why The Matrix was kind of a cool movie. It's really the environment of it and everything.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.800
It's just a really neat concept. The Matrix game that was on like GameCube and PS2 was

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:30.880
not as terrible as I think some made it out to be. Here, let me put it this way. Inception

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:36.440
has that vibe of the first Matrix movie. Like, you know, they set up a world, it's kind of

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.360
similar to our world and stuff, there's a lot of gun combat and stuff like that, and

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:46.040
then there's a lot of weird twists and stuff to it and ways they can manipulate the world

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.320
and stuff like that. Before Neo got way too damn powerful, you know, it's the cool part

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:57.480
of The Matrix. Without the other movies. Okay. Yeah, so it's got that vibe to it and it's

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:04.520
really awesome. That could be cool. Yes, and that Joseph Gordon Lovett guy, man, it's fucking

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:11.040
awesome. That's the kid from Third Rock from the Sun, or he was also the kid in Dark Shadows

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:16.480
years and years ago. Did you ever see that movie Brick? You need to see Brick. No, I

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.660
haven't seen Brick, but he was in some other movie I saw called Mysterious Skin and I kind

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:25.480
of felt dirty. I was like, this is the guy from Third Rock? He's a really good actor

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.840
nowadays. He's a pretty good actor. I think Mysterious Skin was by the guy and he does

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.640
all these messed up teen angst movies. He did like the Nowhere, I think was one, it

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:38.440
was totally fucked up and there's another one in that whole series. All those teen angst

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.760
movies and he did that too. Anyways, yeah, so he's an awesome character, or he plays

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:48.040
a really awesome character in the movie and then of course, you know, DiCaprio's alright.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:53.920
But yeah, seriously, the movie Brick though, it's a film noir set in a high school. In

01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:00.380
modern day high school. It's really awesome. All the dialogue though is like film noir.

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:05.040
It's just so badass. It's just, you gotta see it. It's really cool. I'll take your word

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:10.960
for it. Anyways, yeah, Inception, amazing movie. So the video game, you know, games

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.280
based off movies aren't that great all the time, but if Christopher Nolan's actually

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:26.200
working on it, maybe it'll do alright. Basically he says now, he was considering putting together

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:32.640
a video game based on the movie, but it looks like he's actually, his plans are going a

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.920
little bit further than that. He says he's told Entertainment Weekly that the project

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:43.760
is a go and that he's working with a full team on the game as a longer term proposition.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.120
He's excited to explore the medium of gaming by creating a new story set in the world of

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:56.880
the movie. Entertainment Weekly suggests an MMO, but hopefully it's something better than

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:02.640
that. Interesting. I could see an MMO, but the problem I see with an MMO though, is that

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.440
it's gonna be like The Matrix Online. The Matrix Online just had some flaws. Like The

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:13.200
Matrix could have made an awesome MMO. It's just that what they released wasn't it. Just

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.440
like the Wachowski Brothers could have made an awesome trilogy. But they're like, let's

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:24.040
give Neo all these powers all of a sudden. To this day I've never seen the third movie.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.600
To this day I've never seen the third movie. You're not missing much, it has an ending

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.920
reminiscent of a Highlander 2, which was also a crappy movie. That's what I hear. Wait,

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.720
but didn't Highlander 2, wasn't that the one that introduced Sean Connery? Or was he in

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.800
the first one too and I just forgot? The first one. Dude, he was Ramirez. I forgot. You know

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.680
how many years it's been since I've seen Highlander? That was like in college where everybody got

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.800
high and watched Highlander, but I didn't cause I'm... It's called Highlander man, you

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:55.680
gotta watch it high. I went to Chico State folks, enough said. Enough said. As you drive

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.880
up 99 and it starts to smell like marijuana, it's cause you're passing through Chico on

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:05.280
your way to Humboldt. Although actually that's 101. But forget it. Anyway, how about another

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.680
news story that isn't drug induced. Let's talk about, well you might be able to watch

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:13.820
a lot of Cheech and Chong movies on this though if this comes true. Microsoft is apparently

01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:18.880
in talks, this is if you want to believe Reuters, to bring subscription television and networks

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:25.220
to Xbox Live. This strikes me as kind of a duh. I think Microsoft's been slowly moving

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:30.080
in this direction, but whatever, fine. At least we have a little more news to it. At

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:35.000
least courtesy of Reuters, who's like the Associated Press. Apparently Microsoft is

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.480
having meetings with various media companies to talk about licensing TV programs to be

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:47.000
streamed through a Xbox application. The talks apparently are going well. Although, excuse

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.160
me, I have a frog in my throat, like if anyone saw that Susan Boyle clip from TV this week.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:58.320
Xbox Live TV is apparently a year away at least, which makes sense to me. If they actually

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.640
are going to do something like this, they'll announce it at E3 and roll it out during the

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:08.760
holidays. There is the possibility there that there will be interactive elements into shows

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:14.080
viewed on the console and that there'll be also content silos, meaning that like HBO

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.560
and Showtime could have their own little areas to subscribe to. So, could be interesting.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.020
I like this because remember when I talked about the whole one versus 100 getting canceled,

01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:29.400
I was like, why doesn't Xbox make more of a network out of this? I was kind of talking

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:36.760
about this. I like this whole idea of interactivity or more interactive shows. Like, I think Xbox

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:41.680
had a great thing with one versus 100 and it's a damn shame that they lost the rights

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.520
to the new Game Show Network version or whatever the hell it is that's going on. Which, by

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:49.680
the way, have you seen the new Game Show Network version with Carrie Ann Inaba as the host?

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:55.800
Yeah. It's not as fun as it was on Xbox Live, sorry to say. I'm actually really into something

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:00.800
like this. I just hope the interactive stuff isn't cheesy. Like, you see a lot of Blu-ray

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.640
discs that have the interactive movie component, which is just asking dumb poll questions and

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.440
things. Like, I would like them to see them do more like interactive game shows. We've

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.920
had the rumor of a Poker Night game that's apparently in top secret testing right now.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:21.920
I mean, maybe there's a show to be made of that. I don't know. What if you could vote

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:27.120
on the ending? Vote on a character getting killed off or what have you. American Idol

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.480
being voted on through your Xbox. X Factor on Xbox.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.680
I would think, if anything, what the interactive part might be is like marking clips or something

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:39.920
like that and sharing them with friends. Say, hey, have you seen this? This is pretty cool.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:48.200
Hey, look, it's a nipple slip. Wait, so you think this is more like a TiVo that you could

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:52.640
share? So if there's ever another Janet Jackson booby that slips out, people could be like,

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.240
hey, I saw this awesome clip I wanted to share with my friends.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:00.960
Well, it's like, I guess, Justin TV where you can save clips and stuff.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.160
Oh, God. I hope we're not going to be life casting through our Xbox. There's certain

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.880
people I don't want to see their lives. I mean, the Kinect is putting a camera in all

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:15.320
of our homes, but this is not an idea I like. Although, oh, my God, could you imagine, like

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:19.400
now when they do one versus 100, like with two and a half million Kinects out there and

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:26.920
growing, they could have the one be on TV with the whole Kinect thing, which is a nice

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.360
little camera in your house.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.640
Yeah.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:40.880
It's alive. And then the Xbox 720 will just be called Skynet. That's that's where we go

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:48.920
from here, right? Chat dot orange launch radio dot com if you want to chime in on this live

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.920
with us.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:58.280
Well, isn't Sky a service that's in the UK and technically isn't it a network?

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:02.840
Have you seen this boy? He's on in our chat room, says that's the new show on current

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.120
TV Bar Karma. Viewers make the story and they produce it.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:13.440
Here's a question. This is totally random. And they've got to have this like some sort

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:17.560
of photoshopped, you know, have you seen this boy with pedo bear?

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.880
I'm sure it exists somewhere.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.880
That'd be funny.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:22.880
Absolutely.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.640
Let's see the name that I can ever pronounce. Majinomicon in our chat room says D.C. figured

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:32.440
out a way to capitalize on this. They announced a telephone poll for readers to decide whether

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.440
he lived or died.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.440
Jason Todd.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.920
Yep. Ten thousand votes later, he was dead.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.920
Everyone hated Jason Todd.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.920
Yeah, but that.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.400
And guess what? He's live again.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:46.160
You know what? They did that in the 70s with Andy Kaufman on Saturday Night Live. So I

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.240
don't know if that's really remember. Well, I know none of you were alive when this happened.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.320
I remember that. It was 10 years before I was born.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:57.760
Wasn't in the Man on the Moon movie. I don't know. But they did a whole viewer poll thing

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:05.480
to banish Andy Kaufman from Saturday Night Live. And he was banished. Or I remember.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:09.800
I'm going to really date myself and make myself super lame here, but I don't give a fuck.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:14.920
All right. Do you remember I'm married with children? They had a night where you could

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:20.880
vote on the ending if Al Bundy was going to actually tell Peg he loved her or not. Like

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.680
it was a whole I think it was for Valentine's Day. And you could actually call in and vote

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:30.160
on the ending where if Al Bundy is going to say, I love you, Peg, or just go to bed without

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:38.400
saying it because the whole episode was about Peg was whining. Oh, Al.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.960
You never you never say I love you to me or whatever was the whole plot. That was such

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:51.160
a great show. I'm sorry. But they had an interactive episode. So, you know, but that's did they

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:56.080
from what I remember? Yes. He he said, I love you at the end of the night. It was all the

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:02.720
women voting. But anyway, I wanted to give you beer more often. I said that to get a

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.120
reaction out of dark soccer and didn't really get one. All right. I gave him I gave him

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.000
a look. I did get side eye a little bit. It doesn't transfer well to radio side. I like

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:19.040
Anyway, Rob gets a snort. I don't remember what I was busy looking at gay. I also remember

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:24.120
an episode if you can't do that on television where you could vote, but that wasn't real.

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:29.600
I remember dating myself that does not compute episode where they used gray slime. Thank

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:36.680
God SSJ 100. Matt in our chat room says I remember this. Thank God it's not just me.

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:40.460
I grew up. I'm married with children. That was my show. All right. Speaking of blast

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:43.880
from the past. We like to do a segment here on the show where dark soccer digs through

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:52.880
the archives of gaming and finds a game that she says, Hey, Hey, you. Hey, listen, my line.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:22:02.200
Oh, Al, I found the gayest game ever. Oh, Dan. You should play this game. I've been

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.880
trying to get him to download it for me and he won't do it out of pure principle. So somebody

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:10.600
needs to get it for me. All right, dark soccer. What is the classic game of the week? Joe

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:18.320
on a key. Like I said, gayest game ever. I'm kind of sad that I asked, but here you go.

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:26.520
Seriously, when I told Rob I was picking it, he replied with LOL game. So funny key. It

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:33.560
means super big brother. It's a game series done by Masa. Yeah. And published by NSC core.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:40.440
It came out in 1992 for the PC engine with lots of spinoffs and sequels and other versions.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:47.280
It's a mostly most versions are side scrolling, shoot them up, plays kind of like Gradius.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:54.420
We did get Joe on a key on virtual console and somebody needs to give it to me because

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:57.560
I've actually still been looking for Hugh Carter of this. I would love to have a copy

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:06.080
of Joe on a key. So yeah, to start with the first game, the plot is, has the heroes who

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:13.800
are these big buff muscle bound men in Speedos. Going through different areas, space, ruins,

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:21.480
cities, fighting alien invaders and Bo Emperor Bill, which is built a bit, which is supposed

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:30.040
to be a short of body build, is basically man who achieved 10 consecutive victories

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:36.860
in the great galaxy body building contest is facing an ever decreasing supply of protein.

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:44.060
So he's invading other star systems to establish protein factories. And so the heaven realm

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:53.800
sent Eda Ten and Ben Ten to take over Bo Emperor Bill. And so it's a sweaty, hot muscle battle.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:24:03.200
Yes. But the main characters actually in this one was, Eda Ten was just a pretty guy and

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:08.840
Ben Ten who was a girl blue hair. And then you have the muscle bound men, Samson and

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:16.800
Adon who are the muscle bound men in Speedos and they hover around and they are the brothers.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:25.160
So yeah, it's weird. Basically the whole genre of games that these are in are what's called,

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:33.160
they're very kitschy. They're called bakage, which is like idiot game, sort of a lighter

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:44.600
of the kusoge, which kuso means shit. Shit game. So this is bakage. It's campy. It's

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:52.760
really weird and fun. It's half naked men in suggestive homoerotic poses. And fairly

01:24:52.760 --> 01:25:02.640
neat. It's not really pornographic, just gay. GAY! And the rights to the series are now

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:08.400
actually owned by Extreme Co. Limited. So the different games in this series, we have

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:16.200
chowaniki, we have ai chowaniki, which ai means love, so we have love super big brother.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:20.680
And it has a slightly different control scheme. You can actually do special attacks by doing

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:27.880
street fighter style button meshes. And in this one you fight the, you actually have

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:36.760
to raise the Nioh builder army, well the bad guy. His name is Botekunshiyasu, which is

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:45.000
body conscious, it's a pun, to fight Ita-ten and Ben-ten. And they fall in love and elope.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:53.480
So Samson and Adon have to fight. And it's, yeah. It came out on Virtual Console Japan

01:25:53.480 --> 01:26:00.520
in 2007. Chowaniki Bakuretsu Rantohen, which is a different one, it's a fighting game.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:07.520
You have Ita-ten, Ben-ten, Samson and Adon. They attack by gyrating and flatulating.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:14.360
You have Sabu, who is a pagoda shaped ship with Elvis Presley on the top. Mommy 19, it's

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:22.040
a cute girl mixed with a battleship, transporting three naked folicing men. You have Adam, who

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:28.400
is actually Adam from the creation, who is half naked and riding on the moon. You have

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:36.160
Bote, who is the guy from the first game. And Umimin, who is a latex creature that looks

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:46.080
like a condom. So, yeah, interesting. We also have Chowaniki Kyukyoku Meteki Genga Saikyou

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:53.520
Otoko, which translates to, um, the ultimate most strongest man in the galaxy. Or the ultimate

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:58.520
invincible most galactically powerful man. And it's based off the first Chowaniki. And

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:05.920
it's, uh, Ita-ten and Ben-ten from the first game. Um, yeah, it's still weird. Um, it's

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:11.880
actually available for download on PlayStation Network, uh, in North America. So, get it

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:17.200
and then send it to me. And then we also have the Wonder Swan version, Chowaniki Otoko no

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:25.760
Tamahuda. Um, it's actually, um, I've explained what Hanafuda is before, haven't I? I think

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.160
so. Nintendo started off as a Hanafuda company. It's playing cards. It's a type of playing

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:32.840
card game. Right. Sorry, I just want to, I switched the music to the ending from the

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:37.480
PC Engine version because I wanted to see it. Okay. So, sorry. It's okay. Um, but it's

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:42.960
actually a portmanteau of Tamashi, which is Soul, and Hanafuda, which is a card game.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:51.320
So it's like, it could also mean balls. Tama. Balls. Anyway. Um, it was on the Wonder Swan.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:58.680
I came really close to buying this once. Then, what? You, you said something. Oh no, I was

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.400
just, I was gonna say, you know what's funny is that, you know, obviously I know of this

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.140
game because, you know, I've been doing this show for a while and how can you not know

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:11.160
about this game, but, uh, I've never played it. Believe it or not. I've never played this

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:17.960
game. Well, um. It looks like I just kinda look at it with a raised eyebrow going, what?

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.640
Which I'm sure is what most people do. And it's probably the point. Okay. Well, um, the

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:30.160
last, uh, one on my list is Choeiniki Senaru Protein Densetsu, which is Legend of the Holy

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:36.320
Protein. Wow. And it's done by the group that did Sengoku Blade. Holy Protein? Holy Protein

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.000
Batman. I'm just gonna read exactly what's on the article. The plot of the game centers,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.520
actually, centers on the Holy Protein, a deity-like glob of what may be semen. Samson and Adon

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:56.040
hover around the glob, absorbing enemy fire as they did in the previous game. Yeah, um,

01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:03.960
yeah. And it has, um, a Mona Lisa painting that fires lasers from its eyes, and a giant

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:10.120
cross-dressing man in a maid outfit. So yeah. Um, and then there was Choeiniki Zero, which

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:17.560
came out by, um, Extreme Co. Limited, and, uh. But the whole thing with Choeiniki is

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:25.680
that it's so completely freakin' nuts that you can't help but love it. I mean, there's

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:31.680
actually, uh, Masaya made a game called, um, well, a series called Langrisser, which I've

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:37.400
played a few of those games. Um, but Samson and all of them are in it. You have to go

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:42.960
to the Muscle Shrine where you fight Samson, and then you can use the Aniki Summon. It's

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:47.120
on the Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, and PlayStation versions, which I've played the Super Nintendo

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:55.920
in. Um, Capcom game God Hand makes fun of Samson and Adon as powerless, powerless yet

01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:02.200
flamboyant drag queens, who are the first bosses in the game. Wow. Yeah. Um, they, uh,

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:09.240
they have, uh, Samson and Adon have a weapon called Men's Beam, which is white energy from

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:23.040
holes in their head. Wow. Yeah. It's just, it's gay. And I'm saying this, it's gay. Like,

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:29.360
I don't really think it's gay as in homosexual, it's more like gay as in, um, Christmas. You

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:34.360
know, don't we now our gay apparel? That's, that's where we're at. I think that it's full

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:41.480
of penis references, and naked men in speedos, and drag queens. Uh, AlphaKananagram in our

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.520
chatroom says, Sky, I tried gifting you Choe and Iki on virtual consoles. Is that what

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:49.120
you talked about? I don't remember playing it. Maybe I did, and I just blocked it from

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:53.960
my mind. DDRDollarBill in our chatroom says, gay isn't the word I'd use for Choe and Iki.

01:30:53.960 --> 01:31:04.280
Yeah, I'm not so sure. I think I might use the word what. I want it. All right. Anyhow,

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:08.200
there it is, your classic game of the week. If Dark Soccer is all finished over there,

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:17.800
Choe and Iki on various systems. And honestly, Rob, after I've played, I've played like a

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:25.160
couple of them. They're actually really fun. But it's so bizarre. And I just mean, you

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:29.040
can't help but laugh and be happy while you're playing it. Because it's naked. Well then

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:34.480
it is gay. Because gay means happy. And I wasn't meaning like. I know, I know. You know

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:41.040
what I mean. I know what you mean. It's just, it was, it's gorgeous. It's like, it's, it's

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:50.200
beautiful. Penis. I'm 12. I'm gonna need to crop that and play, add that to the sound

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.120
board at some point. All right, just, just messing. All right, we're gonna take a break,

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.720
but don't go anywhere guys. We'll be right back. Your Twitter topics, and God, you saw

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.440
what came last week and what that became. So who knows what's on the Twitter this week.

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:05.680
So get those in at twitter.com slash o-l-r. We're gonna also get to the mailbag and we're

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.760
gonna talk about some other news stories. We're gonna talk about some goings-on in Xbox

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:14.720
Live Arcade. We're gonna talk about the future of arcade games in another country. And we're

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.340
gonna talk about a game that is being pirated that's doing something kind of lolsy. Especially

01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:23.760
if you're Dark Soccer, you're gonna find this pretty lolsy. So we'll be back after this

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:32.560
quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:37.240
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:43.360
a voice. We are taping live our 392nd episode on this lovely Sunday evening, December the

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:50.440
5th, right, of 2010. I lost track of time. Only 20 shopping days left. Actually no, not

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:56.280
even that many. 19. Uh oh. Oh well. Anyhow, this is the part of the show where we like

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:59.680
to welcome you guys back. We're gonna get into the rapid fire news in a minute. But

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:04.100
I want to bring up a couple things. First, since I didn't mention shopping days and shopping

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:09.440
going on, have you guys like kind of gone out and tried to brave the masses going on

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.160
right now? Like I'll tell you, I was in the mall yesterday and it had nothing to do with

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.720
shopping. Well, it did. I was getting a card for somebody. But I happen to be at the mall

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:21.840
and uh, it was a madhouse. But I went into GameStop and they were having some pretty

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:27.040
interesting deals. I damn near bought a copy of Borderlands for 18 bucks used. But then

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.280
Alan was like, well, but you want to get the PC version so you can play with me. And I'm

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:34.480
like, oh yeah, that's true. And you want to get the game of the year version so you can

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:40.240
play Duke Nukem Forever earlier. True, but that's also more, more money. Like $18 to

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.360
see if I, cause I don't know if I'm gonna like it or not. You're gonna love it. Seriously.

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:47.040
You think? All right, we'll see. We'll see. But then I'm also like, well shit, Cataclysm

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:52.400
is coming out this week. Or you could borrow my copy. I like that idea. Well then also

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.880
there's always the whole like, I could just play it on Alan's computer, but we always

01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:00.340
get distracted because like, oh, but we really need to run a raid and wow, oh boy, we really

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:06.120
need to go out and drink or whatever we're doing. So anyhow, I have either of you guys

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:12.480
been to the stores and looked at deals? Well, I didn't specifically go shopping. Um, when

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.560
Marissa was here, we went over to the Arden Fair Mall. Ooh. And we just walked and looked

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:24.600
at stuff and I popped into Forever 21 and looked at jackets cause I liked some of the

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:27.160
clothes there. I wouldn't wear all of it, but I liked some of it. Was that a freaking

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.640
mad house though? Like the rest of the malls seem to be? Yeah, it was kind of crazy, but

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.840
not so bad. I mean, I went into, you see, wait, wait, I did buy something. Oh, it's

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:40.920
not in here. I bought this gorgeously obnoxious leopard print purse at Claire's. I remember

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:47.040
you for $5 cause you're a 12 year old girl. Yes. It was cute. Shut up. So I bought, I

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.280
bought a leopard print purse cause I thought it was cute and adorable and I like, I like

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:56.720
stuff. I'm a girl. Loud. Just cause I'm wearing pyramid head today doesn't mean I'm not going

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.920
to be fashionable tomorrow. First I thought you were looking down cause you said I'm a

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.960
girl and then he kind of looked down like as if you were checking your breasts to make

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:07.400
sure they were still there. Look how I bounce. But you were looking at pyramid head on your

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:15.280
shirt. All right. P Hiddy. All right. Special to me. Tons of kids at the mall too. Oh my

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:22.960
God. Kids everywhere at the mall. Oof. And I went to target boy. It's, that's an even

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.440
bigger mad house. Anyway, I won't bore you with that. What I will bore you with is a

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.760
talk about our spinoff shows. If you like orange lounge radio, why don't you take a

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:37.080
minute to check out our spinoff shows. Dark Sakura. She does a podcast called comic insanity.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:43.120
It's all about comics and it's with her buddies Tiara and Dan shadow and it's every Tuesday

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:46.960
and you can find it on itunes. And this all this month we'll be having a special, which

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.400
is our year end review of comics. Oh boy. So now you know what you got to catch up on.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.600
You get to see how much we are, you know, PO'd with Matt fraction. All right. Now do

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.000
you remember the show? I do. I plugged your show. You remember my show? The one with Dolly

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:05.880
Parton and her boobs. Oh, sorry. It's best little hoard house in whatever fucking planet

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:12.760
that is. Azeroth. Yes. Azeroth. Yeah. Okay. But yeah, it's there. You're cute. You and

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:16.800
you and extra for, you're adorable. We had a fun show this week. Actually. We had a special

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:21.400
guest. A frat. Matt is what I call him online, but a grandpa Warcraft is what we were calling

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:25.360
him because he's been playing and you know, Matt, he's been playing a Warcraft since vanilla.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.900
So we were calling grandpa Warcraft. It was a good show. Wow. So I have absolutely no

01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:34.480
idea what that means. He's old and he plays Warcraft. That's what it means. Uh, and also,

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:39.280
uh, we have a huge show plan. That's not really, we're just doing the same old show, but it

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.640
is cataclysm. The third expansion of wow does come out this week. It's a pretty big deal.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:51.320
So we're going to go plans versus zombies. Yeah. The sad thing is it goes live at midnight

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:56.520
tomorrow and I got to go to bed cause of work. I can't stay up and play wow. And then Tuesday

01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:00.600
I have to go bake cookies cause there's this whole cookie party. Yes. There is a cookie

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:10.400
party going on at work. That's why the show got canceled. That was the best part of the

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:15.560
Sarah Silverman show was cookie party with what was the host name? Miss something on

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:20.160
cookie party. Forget it. All the listeners at home are like, I thought this was a video

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:27.120
game podcast. Anyhow, let's do some rapid fire news and remind them that it is a game

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.760
podcast. Uh, Loki, what do you got for us? By the way, Twitter last chance, twitter.com

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:36.560
slash O L R for Twitter topics tonight. Yes. Uh, cool stuff. Uh, you may remember that

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:43.600
Ghostbusters a game that came out almost a year and a half ago. Um, there is a few achievements

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:49.840
that were unable to be achieved, I guess, because the game was broken and uh, well apparently

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:56.960
they have actually, um, just, uh, put through Xbox live certification, the, uh, update that

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:03.320
will fix those. And, um, I guess these now four achievements that were unable to be unlocked

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:08.820
before, um, are being fixed. So that's kind of cool that they're actually still working

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:14.900
on patches for games despite the fact that they came out long time ago. So, um, neat.

01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:18.880
And then of course if you're a fan of Ghostbusters, you'll be happy to know that Ghostbusters sanctum

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:25.720
of slime will be coming to Xbox live arcade and PlayStation network and PC next spring.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:30.400
And the game is a little bit different than the one that was on Xbox 360 and PlayStation

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:36.760
three, uh, previously from terminal reality. Uh, this is actually going to be, um, kind

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:43.280
of a top down action game. And they're saying that it's being developed by the assault heroes

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:50.120
creator, uh, one echo and it's a four player online and a co you know, local co-op, a top

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:54.520
down action game that's gonna not really have any of the voice actors because you know,

01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:00.660
they're expensive and um, they're not really sure if, uh, you know, the characters from

01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:04.060
the movie obviously are going to be there or they're going to be replaced by a new team

01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:10.720
or something like that. Um, but yeah, it's a pretty awesome looking actually from some

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:17.000
of the screenshots that they had. So that'll be coming sometime soon next year. Uh, game

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.840
loft is announcing some new games. They actually had some pretty decent ones when they're not

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:29.380
ripping off other games. Um, nice. Like I worked that in there. Uh, Nova two, it's their

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:34.520
first person shooter game. That's kind of a little bit like halo. It's inspired, I guess

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:38.000
if you will, but it's actually pretty solid. I thought you said they weren't ripping off

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:43.400
other games anymore. It's a sci fi shooter. Okay. So you know, whatever. All right. But

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.240
it's actually pretty cool. Um, it adds new weapons, new enemies and uh, the new enemies

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:53.000
of course have jet packs and uh, we'll offer a multiplayer and I guess it, uh, continues

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.400
the story of the first game. Uh, but I guess people that have the original wall so get

01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:02.560
rewarded different, uh, with some bonus XP. And then they have shadow guardian, which

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:08.400
is a new IP for game loft and it's kind of similar to like an uncharted or tomb Raider

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:15.960
game. It's more of like a, an action, um, adventure game. So, uh, it looks very uncharted

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:22.720
esque, but um, you know, nice to see some sophisticated games coming to iOS despite

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.640
the fact game office really hit or miss with some of this stuff. But, um, yeah, the original

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:31.840
IP stuff's not bad. You know, they're gang star or whatever. Um, it's not a bad clone

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:42.400
of like the old PSP or PlayStation two grand theft auto games. And then, um, let's see,

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:48.960
Def Jam. Uh, this is kind of interesting in the UK. Uh, Def Jam is, um, do their rap star

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:56.000
game. They're having a competition that offers the winner, um, a record contract. Apparently,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.640
um, they're going to be teaming up, I guess, with Atlantic records, UK, and they're giving

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:09.600
a one lucky UK resident chance to, um, have their very own record. And they're going to

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:15.440
be employing the game's freestyle mode and contestants will upload their hottest, um,

01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:20.680
40 bars, uh, give or take. And they're going to be judged by the Def Jam rap star community

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:26.280
because they do have a really big, uh, community aspect to the game, actually, despite the

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.480
fact that a lot of people don't. I had a chance to get this game. I was going to get it for

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:35.800
just the microphone, you know, cause I got it for free. I actually passed. Wow. It wasn't

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.240
a bad game. I mean, I don't listen to really the, I mean, maybe there's a couple songs

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:45.320
in there. I know, but it's not the type of game. I can't see myself honestly playing

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.760
this game. Especially I live by myself and a lot of my gaming is alone, so I just can't

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:57.320
see myself, you know, sitting there, you know, rapping by myself in my apartment. I mean,

01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:04.760
there's just something kind of sad. I'm crying all night today cause I just watched a sad

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:12.920
movie. I'll play Def Jam rap star to make me feel better. Sip it on gin and juice. Uh,

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:18.100
it says the top regional finalists will then have to compete in front of a live audience

01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:24.240
at the UK HMV, um, locations. Uh, they're saying eight mile style and that's going to

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:32.360
be in February. And of course that means that the winner, um, will be able to have the actual,

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:38.080
um, you know, record contract. See, Loki, you should be participating in this. That's

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:45.720
why you need the game. Yes. I bet anything. If you last night, I don't believe that Sacramento

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:53.480
is in the UK. Uh, you know, my basic geography knowledge says that's not correct. We need

01:42:53.480 --> 01:43:03.160
to fix this. Just Kidman rap. What do we know to do it? Who else is in the UK? How about

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:11.920
Aki Ripper? Let's get Aki Ripper. Does Sweden count? Sweden? I don't know. We need to find

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:20.960
that out. All right. Anyhow, uh, yeah, I have some news, but whatever. It's just not as

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:26.480
cool as Swedish rap. A rock band reloaded is now available on the iOS systems, meaning

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:32.160
the iPhone, the iPod touch, the iPad. It's five bucks on the phones and phone with no

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:38.240
phone and $10 on the iPad. There's a new expert mode and apparently full vocal support. So

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:43.880
you could actually sit there and, you know, sing along with your phone. Uh, also the iPad

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:48.400
version now has split screen multiplayer and several different ways to have the action

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:53.040
on screen. You can reorient gameplay if you're a lefty. That's kind of cool. And apparently

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:56.360
there's a whole drum kit now that you can kind of have so you can kind of beat your

01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:02.440
iPad. I guess that's how it works. Kind of neat. Uh, there are quite a few games available

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:06.800
when you initially download it, including a kryptonite three doors down. So what you

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.320
want by Beastie Boys, White Wedding by Billy Idol. God, I love that song. Uh, Call Me When

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.920
You're Sober by Evanescence. The Perfect Drug by Nine Inch Nails. Uh, Hella Good by No Doubt.

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:21.280
I mean, a lot of these games are sort of in, uh, the rock band game anyway. There's also

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:26.360
tracks that you can download in the music store. I guess there's some free tracks too

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:29.920
in the music store. Of course they're like indie bands and stuff, but the acrobats are

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:35.840
in there. Daylight and Dollar Short if you like the acrobats. Uh, a lot of people around

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.560
the internets were fans of Splosion Man. Remember that game that was on the indie marketplace?

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:46.280
Well, guess what? A sequel has been announced. Ms. Splosion Man. I know they're doing like

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.280
the whole Ms. Pac-Man thing, but seriously, they could have done Splosion Woman. I know.

01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:56.080
I was gonna say, wouldn't that be Ms. Splosion Woman? Or maybe this is like a drag queen.

01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:00.960
I don't know, but whatever. Uh, Ms. Splosion Man, whatever gender he or she happens to

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:07.240
be, is planned to come out in the fall of 2011. This is a really early announcement,

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:14.000
but there it is. Uh, the CCO Josh Baer of Twisted Pixel has said, quote, we could have

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.160
churned out new levels for Splosion Man, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.520
gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff. But we didn't want to just do Splosion Man

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:28.340
2. It had to be something a little more interesting. That is why we're making Ms. Splosion Man.

01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:32.200
There's actually a teaser trailer that's out there and everything, and as you can expect,

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:39.560
it pays homage to Ms. Pac-Man. World of Warcraft news, but not the kind that gets me excited.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:45.640
Sorry, DarkSakura. World of Warcraft apparently is now streaming and playable on an HTC Desire.

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:51.680
Yeah, it's this whole little tech demo that was out there before. It's now been fully

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:57.320
realized apparently. An HTC Desire smartphone is running World of Warcraft, and I don't

01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:01.180
know if it's like a streaming thing or what, but there's actually a demo that's out there

01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:05.860
on YouTube. Um, I think it is a streaming thing that they're doing with this device

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:10.120
because they say you can do just about any game. And, uh, yep, they're playing World

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:16.960
of Warcraft. And, I mean, do we really need that on the phone? I just, it looks like it's

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:22.600
a pain in the ass to play, quite frankly. Whatever. I guess some people will be into

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:29.160
that. DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Well, we have a few things. Um, to, uh, start

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:36.360
us off with, uh, some Kirby. How about Kirby? Kirby's Epic Yarn will be out in 2011 for

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:43.880
our European friends, out on February 25th. I was trying to say 25th. It'll be 25th. So,

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:51.320
uh, you have to wait, but it's gonna be, uh, all cool. They have to change, you know, in

01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:56.640
British English, I guess, so that it can be, you know, a duvet instead of a comforter,

01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:01.680
and a lift instead of an elevator, and, uh, a boot instead of the trunk. You know, that

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:09.480
type of thing. And, uh, new, uh, characters for Super Street Fighter IV, we have Dun-dun-dun,

01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:16.080
didn't we call it last, uh, last week? Oni Akuma, who is like Shin Akuma, who is the super

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:23.360
evil one. And then we have Evil Ryu. Rrrrr. So that's gonna be super hot, cause I loved

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:30.840
Evil Ryu. Of course, I would love to have Evil Sakura next. Dark Sakura. Ooh. And then,

01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:37.520
for Rock Band, more download content, we get Queen! Finally, finally, finally. Um, it's,

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:44.720
uh, Rock Band 3, um, upgraded tracks from Lego Rock Band. Um, so here's what's, uh,

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:50.840
also gonna be in the Queen Extravaganza Pack 1. Hammer to Fall, Keep Yourself Alive, Now

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:55.720
I'm Here, Play the Game, Tenement Funster, We Are the Champions, We Will Rock You, and

01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:02.480
the Rock Band 3 Enhanced Pack, I Want It All, I Want to Break Free, Killer Queen, One Vision,

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:07.520
Somebody to Love, and Under Pressure. I am so buying. Which also is David Bowie. I am

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:11.600
so buying that Enhanced Pack. So am I. The, uh, first pack is a lot of really, kind of

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:15.560
like, off-cut tracks, which, I mean, Queen is Queen, they're cool. With these, they threw

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.760
two big ones in there to kinda, uh, make it feel a little more valuable, but, uh, I definitely

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:25.000
want, like, all my favorite Queen songs are in that other pack, so. And for some reason,

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.840
this is weird, I never bought the Queen track pack in Rock Band originally. Like, I just

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:32.520
somehow missed it, or I wasn't playing Rock Band at the time. Like, there's already, like,

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:37.480
fifteen Queen songs available in there. And, I really need to get Sing Star Queen at some

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.400
point, cause I'm sure I can find it really cheap now. Just like Sing Star Abba is on,

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:46.120
like, every Target clearance rack. Really need to get Sing Star Queen. Going to our

01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.160
chatroom at chat.orangelaungerady.com, there's some comments, uh, SSJ100Matt is talking about

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:55.080
Ms. Splosion Man. Ms. Splosion Man better have her making a sandwich in the end. Just

01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:02.400
sayin'. Tigerclaw says, the third one should be Junior Explosion Man, or Baby Splosion

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:10.500
Man. Here you go. I don't know about explosion baby. Chat.orangelaungerady.com. I think there's

01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:14.880
an indie game on the marketplace that is about, like, exploding babies, uh, that might be

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:20.600
what you're thinking of, I don't know. Hey, let's go to the tweeter! Twitter.com slash

01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:32.660
O-L-R. Uh, SSJ100Matt is sending us a story courtesy of Travis Donovan. South Korea is

01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:38.240
getting ready to set an internet curfew for young teens. Really, I had not heard about

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.920
this, but then again I did not listen to, um, USL last night, I was a very, er, on,

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:49.240
yeah, on Saturday night, I was a very naughty boy, I was out. Uh, but apparently South Korea,

01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:52.480
although I notice I'm being linked to a story from Fox News, so take it from it with a grain

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:59.400
of salt. South Korea is, uh, apparently considering a nationally enforced gaming curfew, uh, in

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:04.080
an effort to, um, curb internet addiction. Cause you know a lot of times we've had those

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:09.240
crazy internet addicts story and they all seem to be out of South Korea. Well apparently

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:14.480
it will make it illegal for internet service providers if this bill is passed to give online

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:21.420
gaming access to users under the age of 16 between the hours of midnight and 6 AM. For

01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:25.560
South Korean students this will mean no gaming at all. It's normal to be in school until

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:32.640
midnight due to extracurricular activities and studying. What? Wow. That, that, that

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.520
much study is actually pretty normal. Wow, makes me feel like a lazy asshole even though

01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:41.440
I was doing like every extracurricular activity in high school, I was still home by seven

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:49.040
or eight o'clock. Dang. Alright, well, interesting. What do you guys think about this ban? They

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:51.800
would never get away with something like that here in the US, that's for sure. It's not

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:55.120
the government's responsibility. It's the parent's responsibility. If they're not doing

01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:02.040
their job then it's... I agree. Nope, I agree 100%. It's not, not the government's responsibility

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:08.120
but whatever. Alright, moving on. Dark Tetsuya on Twitter wants to remind us of this and

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:12.080
yes this is something I definitely need to plug and we'll probably be plugging a little

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:19.320
more as we hit the deadline here but the USL-OLR Madness, this used to be called March Madness

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:23.680
but I guess they moved it from March. 2011 is now open for nominations. This is something

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:27.760
a little more that our buddies at Under Station Live do and they really involve themselves

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:32.520
with but we like to support it here at OLR and I know I have already submitted my list.

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:38.960
Now if you don't know what this is, it's basically a competition a la March Madness, the NCAA

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:45.740
competition to choose the greatest game ever. Now this game has changed from year to year.

01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:51.100
I believe last year Chrono Trigger finally won which why I don't know, so many people

01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:55.320
wank about that game. It's not that great people but Super Metroid has won previously

01:51:55.320 --> 01:52:00.700
which I completely understand and support. Super Mario Brothers 3 has won before which

01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:06.340
okay yeah Mario, Mario games got to win at some point. So who will win this year? IDK

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:12.140
but you need to submit your top 25 list to uslmadness at gmail.com. Now the deadline

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:18.300
is January 3rd, 2011 so you have a little while but don't procrastinate. Please don't

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:22.300
procrastinate. I've already sent my list in and you should send yours in too. Send it

01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:26.620
in order from 1 to 25. More details available on our website at orangelandsradio.com and

01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:30.900
I imagine it's available at Understation Live's website as well. They are live every Saturday

01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:36.380
night right here at All Games Radio. We're going to some tweets from Spazinator. I agree

01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:43.220
with Jamie's thoughts on Choniki. I got the PS1 and to say that it's weird and or gay

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:48.380
is an understatement. It's like saying water is wet. First it was a novelty for me but

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:53.740
once the novelty wore off I forgot about it. As long as you mean gay meaning happy I'm

01:52:53.740 --> 01:53:01.660
okay with that. Well I mean it's full of homoerotic imagery. It is, it is but I just you know

01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:07.980
whatever. And you know me I never use the word gay to mean anything. I know, I know.

01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:14.380
I mean penis. But anyway there's a lot of games like that though where like once the

01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:19.180
novelty wore off it's kind of over. There's sadly too many games like that out there but

01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:24.000
whatever. Anyhow Tiger Claw sends us a variety of tweets. I seem to remember there's a two

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.520
tweet limit but I'm feeling generous and I had beer before the show tonight so I'm going

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:33.780
to let him have all three tonight because I'm kind and generous. First off the Toronto

01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:41.020
Police recover half a million dollars in stolen Sony goods. They are on it up there in Canada.

01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:45.940
The 39 year old man in Toronto was arrested for stealing half a million dollars. We're

01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:50.180
assuming of course that's Canadian. I don't know because they call it dollars too. PlayStation

01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:56.820
3's, PSP's and games. Apparently this was due to tractor trailers that were stolen on

01:53:56.820 --> 01:54:01.660
November 15th and 16th in Brampton. These trailers had about half a million dollars

01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:07.820
in PS3's, PSP's and video games. That's where all the Sony stuff went in Canada. Well the

01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:15.740
39 year old was arrested and will be in court on January 10th of 2011. Tiger Claw also sends

01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:21.220
us a link. Standalone motion sensing game console believes honesty is the best policy.

01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:25.740
This is linked to a story on Joystiq. What is this all about? Apparently it's a knock

01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:33.100
off of the Nintendo Wii. There's a system now called the Wireless 60 and there's a description

01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:39.000
on the back of the box. This is great. The description on the back of the box says, if

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.860
you are looking to purchase or own an Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Wii or equivalent, this

01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:50.960
product does not compare or compete with these technologies. Well that's, that's awfully

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.760
upfront and endearing. Thank you. Thank you for being honest. But I love that it is in

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:59.440
small print on the back. If you're looking for a Nintendo Wii or, but you know what?

01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:05.460
These might not be what you wanted. Just, just saying. But if you want the golf kit

01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:12.700
and the ping pong kit, this is the system for you. How much is one of these? They're

01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:17.140
probably cheap. I don't know. Some of these games probably aren't much worse than a bunch

01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:20.580
of the crap on the Wii honestly. You might be selling yourself short a little bit there

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:32.860
Wireless 60. I love the name too. It's just shy of being Wii 60. Think about it. And lastly

01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:37.740
from Tigerclaw in our last tweet tonight at twitter.com slash o-l-r, people really did

01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:45.760
buy Donkey Kong with bananas. Do you remember that there was this whole promo with the UK

01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:51.860
gamers and the UK could actually buy the game with bananas? Yes. Apparently there were some

01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:57.980
folks that actually braved the cold weather and 20 people walked away with the game having

01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:06.940
paid for them in bananas. How many bananas? It just said a bunch of bananas. So we don't

01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:12.340
know exactly how many but it was the first 20 people in line to give a bunch of bananas.

01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:17.180
Sounds like a fun promo. And then all the staff's like what the fuck are we gonna do

01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:22.540
with these bananas? It's basically a eat em! Dude, bananas are great. It's basically a

01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:26.460
Black Friday-esque type of promotion. I mean Old Navy gave away Dance Central to like the

01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:31.900
first few people in line right? So I mean you know that's not completely unheard of.

01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:36.260
Alright that's gonna do it for Twitter topics tonight. Twitter.com slash o-l-r. In the meantime

01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:46.140
back to more gaming news. Loki. Yes. So you know with, they had kind of an indie launch

01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:55.060
thing for the Xbox Marketplace. Well now there's kind of the Microsoft Game Studios promotion

01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:59.420
that they're doing for Xbox Marketplace and of course they have three games coming out

01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:05.940
for the games for the holidays presented by Microsoft Game Studios. And these three games

01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:12.620
would be including World of Keflings which does have avatar support in it. Rascals and

01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:21.700
Elo Meelo. Even though Elo Meelo you can get it now if you know how. So each, looks like

01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:32.580
they're gonna be 800 Microsoft points each or $10. And Elo Meelo of course is on Xbox

01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:36.660
Live right now. There is a way to do that. Or you can wait to the official release which

01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:43.540
is January 5th. And then of course. Now why would I want to wait? Exactly. Who wants to

01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:51.940
wait? World of Keflings. That is kind of a puzzle slash racer mashup game. And that's

01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:59.180
gonna be, I'm sorry, the puzzle racer is Rascals and that's gonna be coming out on 29th. World

01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:04.460
of Keflings will be on the 22nd. Like I said those are each gonna be 800 Microsoft points

01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:10.380
or $10. And of course if you buy more than one there's some bonuses that you get with

01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:16.180
that. Not necessarily money back but some neat stuff anyways. You get cross unlockables

01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:22.300
for each game. For example in Elo Meelo if you, you can get an unlockable Keflings or

01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:28.460
Rascal costume for Elo or Meelo by purchasing the other games. Additionally you can also

01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:35.860
unlock Elo and Doug as playable characters in Rascals. And you can also unlock Rascal

01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:43.260
characters within Elo Meelo and World of Keflings by purchasing the full range of games as well.

01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:53.460
Even crazier it says you can get Rascals early by buying World of Keflings. Rascals can be

01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:59.420
bought from within that game a week before it's released on the 29th. Okay I have to

01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:03.780
draw a map to follow all that but fine. So basically all these games are giving each

01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:07.340
other the reach around essentially. Pretty much. Interesting. It's a throwaway reach

01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:11.260
around. I kinda like that idea. I mean even though none of these games are things I'm

01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:14.620
particularly excited about. I guess you never know though. I mean like I didn't think I'd

01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:21.160
be excited about Super Meat Boy and it's pretty awesome. It's a neat promotion and very different

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:26.420
from what the summer one where it's just like buy X number of games, get points. You know

01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:31.380
what I mean? Like I kinda like the idea they've got going on here a little better. So that's

01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:35.620
kinda cool. I like the way the games are interacting with each other. Do you have any interest

01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:41.660
in any of these games, Loki? Rascals kinda sounds neat. Uh, Elo and Meelo look kind of

01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:49.340
cool. Uh, I never played Kingdom of Keflings so hmm. I know I never played Kingdom of Keflings

01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:52.300
either but apparently it's pretty popular. But I thought it was only popular because

01:59:52.300 --> 01:59:59.060
of the Avatar thing. But I don't know. Alright well moving on to a game I am really looking

01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:02.300
forward to and I was very disappointed it didn't make this Christmas but whatever. It'll

02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:08.780
come out soon enough when it's ready. Little Big Planet 2 is on its way pretty soon and

02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:12.660
there's a beta going on right now. Now there's an update that happened on the PlayStation

02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:17.880
blog where the marketing manager at Sony Computer Entertainment America talked through a tutorial

02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:24.300
how you can record voices in the game and assign them to characters. Oh my gosh that

02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:28.780
looks awesome. I can't play the whole video here because there's a lot to it but uh, yeah

02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:33.700
apparently there's these whole little like pins that you can get in the game and you

02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:37.500
can go through tutorials and one of the things you get to do, I'm trying to find where it

02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:41.380
is in the video I probably won't get it here live on air, but you can actually record voices.

02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:47.900
That is awesome. So we could actually do an OLR level voiced with OLR characters. That

02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:51.700
would be kind of fun. We can be little sack boys and girls. Yes we could. We should also

02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:54.580
get Marissa to do voice acting for us. We should definitely get Marissa to do voice

02:00:54.580 --> 02:01:01.420
acting for us and I think she needs a sack girl that you know has very large sacks. Marissa

02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:08.060
needs to create UTA. I love Marissa I wish I was able to see her when I was in LA. But

02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:12.380
yeah that's awesome. I'm so looking forward to this game. You know what though? Creating

02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:16.540
levels in LittleBigPlanet 1 was hard enough. I can't imagine how hard it's going to be

02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:22.020
in version 2. But I'm very excited about this. I hope you guys are too. Loki will you be

02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:28.860
doing some voice acting for a level in LittleBigPlanet? I can I guess. AlphaCananagram says this is

02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:33.280
old news. Whatever it's new to me I'm not in the beta. I haven't been following the

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:39.340
news as closely as I should. Yes and Tigerclaw reminds us as well. I thought this on last

02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:45.460
week's show but maybe not. LittleBigPlanet 2 has no 3D support. There will not be 3D

02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:54.680
in LittleBigPlanet 2. And to that I say thank you. It is not necessary. There you go. Those

02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:57.660
comments from chat.orangelaundry.com. It's just something that they're really pushing

02:01:57.660 --> 02:02:01.700
but yeah you're right it's not necessary because they haven't figured out how to do it correctly

02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:08.060
without making the gameplay suffer. Izaminar Chatroom says I think the phrase you're looking

02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:14.100
for is heavy baggage. Thank you. Alright let's go to DarkSakura with another news story.

02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:20.180
Hey the mailbag is not that far away just so you know. DarkSakura? Sega is well they're

02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:28.140
looking to expand back into the arcade market but not in Japan. Not in the US but in China.

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:32.380
But as being the second largest economy in the world, China seems like it's going to

02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:38.220
be a prime market for video games. Especially arcade based games. And so they're actually

02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:45.040
taking games like Outrun and Virtua Fighter and doing new versions of them in China. It

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:54.460
makes sense but I'm really not sure. What do you think Rob? I don't know. I mean I don't

02:02:54.460 --> 02:03:04.220
live in that country so it's hard for me to say what kind of culture it is but I hate

02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:08.780
that arcades are dying here and then but at the same token when was the last time I went

02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:12.140
to one? It's been a long time. But the reason why I don't go to them is that there's not

02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:16.540
a lot of serious arcades here anymore you know. So I think if they're doing it kind

02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:21.180
of more seriously in Japan and China which makes sense because the internet cafe culture

02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:25.900
it's much bigger there too than it is here. Like there aren't really internet cafes here

02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:31.180
anymore I mean there's there's one or two especially in the Chinatowns and Koreatowns

02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:37.980
like the biggest one I can think of is in Koreatown in LA. But cyber cafes to us are

02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:42.740
like Starbucks where you bring your laptop and use the Wi-Fi. Yeah that's what I was

02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:49.620
like and there's so many neat cafes like especially in Japan I want to go to the cat cafes. But

02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:56.140
I think it's to encourage a more social aspect yet still you know it offers a service with

02:03:56.140 --> 02:04:00.300
it. Some of those social games were the best though and it is kind of a bummer that Xbox

02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:06.240
Live sort of took that and made it not needing to go to your arcade. Like the best example

02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:10.140
I can think of is when Soul Calibur 2 was in the arcades and it had that mode where

02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:14.460
you you had your own fighter and the arcade machine would start to kind of memorize how

02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:19.660
you play and then you could fight other people to take over the kingdom and remember that

02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:22.980
whole little mode that was awesome. Conquest mode. Yeah the conquest mode. And I remember

02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:26.220
it wasn't in the home version. I remember we'd come up against each other's and go oh

02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:32.320
my god that's exactly how you play. Remember? Yes. And like even one time where I was playing

02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:36.860
I think on somebody I was finishing someone else's game and played my own. Played my own

02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:44.020
person was like damn I'm a cheap bitch. Or remember. Ice Calique. Something near and

02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:48.500
dear to our hearts. Remember when DDR Max 2 was in the arcades and had the community

02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:52.820
unlocks where the more you played the faster you'd be able to unlock stuff. That was always

02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:57.740
kind of neat I think. So. And we would keep being and figuring out which one was next

02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:01.980
and follow the pattern. And how the pattern was working and how many points and I remember

02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:05.700
we would be there for some of the unlocks it was like oh my god we got an unlock. We'd

02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:11.900
take pictures and stuff. It's Santa Morete. Alright anyhow. And then Max 300 what's this

02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:18.380
crap? The hell is this? So yeah I think it's cool. I hope maybe some of the ideas used

02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:23.100
in China and Japan they can figure out how to make them work in the US but I'm not gonna

02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:27.620
hold my breath cause I think the US is just a bunch of gambling for kids. These ticket

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:34.340
spitting machines. Anyhow. Loki do you have better news for us? Ticket spitting machines?

02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:41.180
Yeah. No I'm afraid I don't. But you know there's a lot of those redemption machines

02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:47.340
that they have in some of those arcades over there in China and Japan that you know dole

02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:54.420
out DS's and stuff. But this has nothing to do with that unfortunately because it's Wii

02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:59.020
peripheral and I'd be very disappointed to win it in one of those machines. The Wii Speak

02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:05.220
Microphone. Yeah it came out with Animal Crossing, City Folk and they're like oh yeah you can

02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:10.460
chat with other people and hey that's you know it's awesome technology to be able to

02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:13.500
chat with other players when you're playing games you know something that's standard with

02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:19.580
say the Xbox and Playstation 3 which is why we need to get rid of it. And that's sadly

02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:27.140
what's happening. The Wii Speak peripheral is now limited at retail locations and additional

02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:32.920
shipments I guess can be made if consumer demand increases according to Nintendo but

02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:41.020
other than that they are no longer producing those for retail. Not to say that games won't

02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:46.620
still support it but it's kind of sad. Especially since they don't really have any sort of like

02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:55.220
headset options or anything like that for the Wii. I don't know.

02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:59.140
Yeah I mean the Wii's kind of had to catch up in some ways even though Reggie doesn't

02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:02.020
want you to think that. I mean in some ways they had to really catch up to some of the

02:07:02.020 --> 02:07:08.540
technology at the 360 and the PS3 was doing but it didn't work in this case and I think

02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:12.660
part of it was that they'll throw out these peripherals and Nintendo's done this a few

02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:16.680
times they'll throw out these peripherals and then not really support them. Like there's

02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:21.140
one or two games that support it and then that's it. Like the balance board in some

02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:26.580
ways is a bit of anomaly. Like if it didn't have this damn good A plus game behind it

02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:31.900
like I think the balance board would be added to the list of stuff that like Wii Speak.

02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:37.700
But Wii Speak was for what? A game on the Wii that honestly and I hate to say this wasn't

02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:42.600
very good because we'd seen it before. I mean if there hadn't been two other Animal Crossing

02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:48.500
games already then the Wii version would have been awesome but that wasn't the case. So

02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:55.660
and then what else used Wii Speak? Nothing. Nothing. So and it's not like the Wii is known

02:07:55.660 --> 02:08:01.700
for its online gaming capabilities where Wii Speak would come into play so it was kind

02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:10.500
of useless. So it's unfortunate. Some folks in our chat room at chat.orangelandradi.com

02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:17.300
I'm going to say this name again and butcher it I'm sorry. Maginomicon says yeah that was

02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:21.820
a total waste of my money and to be fair there wasn't a better offer on the PS2 a better

02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:26.900
showing. I guess that's one way to look at it. And then AlphaCananagram in our chat room

02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:32.100
says seriously why isn't the Wii Speak hacked already for the PC? That's a good question.

02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:38.460
Maybe nobody cared. Because you can just plug a microphone into the PC and there you go.

02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:45.140
Oh yeah and Maginomicon also says what about the broadband adapter for the GameCube? Oh

02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:50.340
my god talk about a peripheral that really went wrong. That could have been an awesome

02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:53.580
must have peripheral and the Phantasy Star game on GameCube was actually really awesome

02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:59.380
too. Yes it was. It was Phantasy Star Online. And it's a bummer that Sega made it because

02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:08.740
Nintendo just didn't care. Yeah. Nintendo hates Sega confirmed. Alright one other story

02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:14.700
I have for you guys before we get to the mailbag at mailbag.orangelandradi.com. Hey! Maginomicon

02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:22.100
says I pronounced his name right. Woohoo! Woohoo! I know I feel like I should play the

02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:33.060
level up music. You alright over there? I was singing the level up music for you. This

02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:38.900
is news about Game Center on the iPhone and iPod and iPad and honestly I'm kind of looking

02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:42.820
at this going who gives a shit about Game Center but I guess some folks in the gaming

02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:47.060
blogs are trying to say hey Apple's getting away with what Blizzard couldn't get away

02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:52.500
with and that is using real names. Apple made an update to the terms of service on Game

02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:58.000
Center this week saying that they will now use your real name when you send a friend

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.380
request or reply. So if you're going to add someone on Game Center you better be prepared

02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:07.340
for them to see your real name. Now the rest of Game Center will not show the name and

02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:10.100
if you already have people friended on Game Center they're not going to be able to see

02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:16.460
your name. They will see your user handle and that's it. And by the way the terms of

02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:22.580
service also say that users must not pretend to be anyone or any entity they are not. But

02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:27.540
this is not hitting that same kind of pushback that Real ID did. Here's the thing though

02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:31.900
and I think a point that the game blogs are missing is that there were two big problems

02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:38.500
with Real ID that I don't see as a problem in Game Center. Number one, Blizzard was threatening

02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:43.900
to put real names on their forums and fine don't post in the forums except for the fact

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:49.260
that Blizzard will direct you to their forums to report bugs and things. So it was a little

02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:53.580
bit of a catch-22 whereas we want you to use our forums but we're going to out your real

02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:58.940
name as a part of that. And not to get into the rant I got into several weeks ago on this

02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:03.980
show when that was the news but let's just put this quickly. If you think it's not a

02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:08.180
big deal to have your first and last name out there fine but keep in mind you know some

02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:12.060
of us have had stalkers in the past and other scary things that you know make us a little

02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:17.340
hesitant to do that. So you know even though I don't have delusions of grandeur I realize

02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:22.060
this podcast is just this you know little podcast with a loyal fan base. You have to

02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:26.740
remember I have been stalked before because of it and for that reason I choose not to

02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:30.480
tell people my last name unless like I know them in real life. If you know me in real

02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:34.500
life it's not a big deal but just because of what's happened in the past I don't like

02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:39.000
it being out there. So I was not a fan of this at Blizzard. The other thing I was not

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:45.620
a fan of was the friend of friend thing because what would happen on Real ID and they took

02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:50.220
this out but it was in there originally is that you could go onto your friends list and

02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:58.220
see all of your friends friends first and last name. Which I sort of think I know what

02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:03.220
they were trying to do with that but as somebody again who has stalked before because somebody

02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:09.740
used a friend of mine to get to me. I can see where this is a potential for problem

02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:14.040
and it made me very mad about Real ID. Now Blizzard got rid of it. They finally pulled

02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:17.660
their head out of their butt and they decided not to do this on the forum and they turned

02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:21.580
off the friend of friend. They still have the real names in the game and if you add

02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:25.260
somebody to your friends list they see your real name and so forth but at this point I'm

02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:28.660
kinda like okay well I don't add people to my friends list I don't really know so it's

02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:33.340
really not a big deal. And that's kind of where Game Center is at and so I don't think

02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:37.660
it's the same thing that Blizzard is doing because now Game Center is doing what Real

02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:43.460
ID is now and nothing more and I think a big part of the reason why they're doing it is

02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:47.060
that there were the spammers out there. People were posting on their Twitter you know add

02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:50.380
me on Game Center friends and then they got all these spammers. I don't really know how

02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:55.300
you spam people on Game Center but whatever it was out there it was a problem so I think

02:12:55.300 --> 02:13:00.780
this is how Apple's trying to fix the problem. Something else to throw out there is that

02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:07.180
when I used Ping, wow did that tank, but I was on Ping for like a day. When I signed

02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:12.260
up for Ping I was able to use an alias. If you search for Rob Roberts on Ping you'll

02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:18.380
find me, my radio name. So if that's the name that's being used on Game Center then I really

02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:22.680
don't have a problem with it, that's fine. But I don't know like I'm too, I don't really

02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:27.620
know anybody else to send a friend request to because at the end of the day Game Center

02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:32.180
there is zero point to it. What does Game Center bring to the iPhone gaming experience?

02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:38.580
Not a damn thing. Achievements and scoreboards. Whoopty shit. Especially for a lot of games

02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:44.580
that you could write off very easily. These are not serious games. Whereas World of Warcraft,

02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:49.220
that's a huge time thing for a lot of people and a very passionate experience. Whereas

02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:54.460
I don't think people get that connected to their iPhone games. You know it's like lol,

02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:59.420
pocket frogs. I love my pickle, you hush. Honestly I don't really play a lot of Game

02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:03.780
Center games. Mainly it's just Open Faint stuff because there's a lot more games that

02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:08.380
I play that have Open Faint in them. More of them are getting Game Center but I don't

02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:16.100
really care. Yeah I have one game on Game Center and all the rest of mine are Open Faint.

02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:21.580
So yeah, Game Center is, I don't think it's the same thing as Real ID. I think what they're

02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:28.720
doing, I mean, because at the end of the day, WoW has a lot of passion behind it. Game Center

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:35.720
has a lot of, I don't care. No one cur behind it, you know? If I had to delete Game Center

02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:40.180
at the end of the day, I wouldn't cry. But if I had to delete World of Warcraft, I'd

02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:45.180
be very upset that Blizzard made such a dumb decision because, you know, I am, you know,

02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:48.900
call me an addict or whatever you want, I am very invested in that game because it is

02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:54.860
a way for me to kind of play games all along with my friends. So, there you go. Let's go

02:14:54.860 --> 02:15:01.100
to the mailbag. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Every week you guys send us emails and we

02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:05.940
read them. Now the mailbags have been kind of light for the last few weeks but as I understand,

02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:08.660
the listeners have really pulled through this week, haven't they? They did and I've actually

02:15:08.660 --> 02:15:12.580
cut out the really long ones. Aww. Sorry. Are you going to post them online or anything?

02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:17.340
I might post them on the forum. I said there's one I would post on the forum. Okay. Um, but

02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:22.860
I have to do that when I'm ready for two. Um, so, first email. Um, by the lady that

02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:27.340
sent us Boobs, gamer girl. Wait, what? What? Boobs? What? Boobs? She sent a picture of

02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:33.260
her chest and she's wearing an Eggo t-shirt and quite lovely. Lego my Eggo. Says, I just

02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:38.340
wanted to write the show and say you guys do an awesome job. If you keep me, no, you

02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:43.340
keep me laughing and I love it. I wanted to know if anyone is excited about the new Cataclysm

02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:51.340
expansion or do you think it's just hype? Hey, hey. I missed part of that. What was

02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:56.700
that? Don't get me wrong. I've been a fan of World of Warcraft as a whole for a good

02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:03.940
while now. After all, it's my crack AKA way out of the real world for a while. Anyway,

02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:09.740
just wanted to say again, a good job with the show. Sincerely, gamer girl. Without getting

02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:13.100
too much into the Warcraft discussion because now I have a whole nother show for that. Let

02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:17.100
me try to quickly answer the question. I don't think it's all hype because let's face it,

02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:21.900
if you do something the same way for forever, especially in gaming, it starts to get really

02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:27.500
dull. And if you look at vanilla World of Warcraft, the leveling from zero to 60 experience,

02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:32.700
it was now five years, six years old. That's as long as a lot of game consoles last. I

02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:36.740
mean, I realize now in this generation we're in, it's a little bit different, but even

02:16:36.740 --> 02:16:41.680
now we're what, five years since the Xbox 360 launched? And what is...huh? Honestly,

02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:49.380
we could use a Cataclysm in Final Fantasy 11. Granted, they had Dynamis, the uber elite

02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:55.260
hard Cataclysm. But here's the point I'm really trying to make, is that the Xbox 360 has been

02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:58.540
out for what, five, six years now? And what are they doing now? They didn't release a

02:16:58.540 --> 02:17:02.180
new console because of economy and so forth. What are they doing? They're releasing Kinect.

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:06.420
They're trying to reinvent the old experience. Are you suggesting that the Red Rings of Death

02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:12.700
were the Cataclysm of the Xbox? Sure. So, now you have the Cataclysm coming to World

02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:18.060
of Warcraft as a way to kind of reinvent the game and make old stuff new again. And so

02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:21.620
for that reason, yeah, I think it is kind of a big deal. And I think if you are passionate,

02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:25.360
I mean, you already know right now if you're buying Cataclysm or not. And the Galen Rockets

02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:30.340
are pretty awesome. They are. But, let's see, I'm trying to make a long story short and

02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:35.860
it's not really working very well. But I will say this, Cataclysm World of Warcraft was

02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:41.940
a great way for them to get World of Warcraft 2 without making it a whole new game and splitting

02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:46.700
the player base like what happened with EverQuest and Final Fantasy in some regards. World of

02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:53.140
Warcraft Cataclysm is WoW 2. It might not be as jarring of a change, but they went back

02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:58.300
and redid a lot of old shit and made it prettier and just short of the character models, which

02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:03.220
I'm sure will be in the next expansion. It's neat that Blizzard does innovate a little

02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:08.020
bit with each expansion. It's pretty cool. So I think it's a big deal. Okay, I'm done.

02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:11.900
Did you hear? Now, this didn't make our show roll, but did you hear that EverQuest 2 may

02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:18.780
be doing the same thing? What do you mean same thing? Like a Cataclysm type thing? What's

02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:23.780
the point behind it? Just trying to... Get people to play. They need to figure out a

02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:27.500
way to cross the two worlds over, which I know would really piss the players off in

02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:31.660
some regards, but I just feel like where they went wrong was they really split their player

02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:35.220
base from EverQuest to people who don't want to leave EverQuest. There's got to be a way

02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:40.180
to copy your character into EverQuest 2. Granted, I'm talking out my butt because I've never

02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:49.020
played EverQuest or EverQuest 2. I've only watched a friend play the first one. Anyway,

02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:53.340
my point is they made a mistake splitting the player base, but everybody got to learn

02:18:53.340 --> 02:19:02.540
from that. Next email. Aww, this makes my heart feel warm. Rob, Jamie, and Loki. I just

02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:08.060
wanted to say thank you. Having a couple of back episodes to listen to at work helped

02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:12.260
me get through what has been the worst week I've had. Listening to friends I've never

02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:17.220
met talk about and have fun doing something that they and I enjoy was a much needed bright

02:19:17.220 --> 02:19:21.740
spot and distraction from everything. Thank you for all that you guys do, Brad. That's

02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:25.860
our Brad from PodCulture. Well, thank you very much, Brad. I appreciate that. We had

02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:30.980
a really nice message on our Facebook this week too. It's been a week of warm fuzzies.

02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:37.300
Thank you so much. Must be the holidays. Next one. Hey guys, it's Molten Brown. I just wanted

02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:41.660
to ask you for advice. I already have a Nintendo DS and I've been debating whether or not to

02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:46.920
get a PSP for a long time. Part of me wants it for the way the system looks as well as

02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:51.020
better graphics the system offers compared to the DS, but I don't know if it's worth

02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:55.700
the price to pay if there aren't that many games that I will like on it. I really like

02:19:55.700 --> 02:19:59.060
RPGs, fighting games, and games that offer a different visual or playing style than the

02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:04.860
norm like Hotel Dusk. Does the PSP offer any good games that fit what I like? Also, I was

02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:08.460
wondering if the PSP is more comfortable to hold than the DS. I find that my hands start

02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:12.300
hurting after holding the DS for more than an hour. Thanks for the advice, Molten Brown.

02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:15.740
This email is brought to you by the Netherlands. Do you like the dreary weather and temperature

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:23.580
akin to fall on the East Coast? Then the Netherlands is the place for you. Um, Patapon? Patapon's

02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:28.500
cute. Roko Roko? Yeah, those are all cute games. If you like RPGs and fighting games,

02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:34.180
you need that Square Enix game. The fighting one that's Final Fantasy. Dissidia. Yes, Dissidia.

02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:38.100
That should be like number one on your list. But if you like a standard fighting game,

02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:44.020
the Tekken games on PSP are pretty nice. There's a Soulcalibur game out there, I believe. Yeah.

02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:50.660
There's also, as far as RPGs, Puppet Lacrosse was cool. I loved it. I played through it.

02:20:50.660 --> 02:20:54.860
And the Final Fantasy remakes are awesome, if you can find them. Yeah. But, but don't

02:20:54.860 --> 02:21:03.940
get the go. Yeah, don't get the go. Honestly, the go, the go needs to go. The, the... It's

02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:10.300
not worth the money. But, um, as for hand comfort, given that I have hand problems after

02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:19.300
my surgery, uh, the PSP really is fairly comfortable, just because of the curved ends on it. But,

02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:25.180
it, it's still reaching around for those buttons, and I have these little short thumbs. It's

02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:29.820
really about the same, in my opinion. Don't you think, Rob? It's about the same feel?

02:21:29.820 --> 02:21:34.380
I'm sorry, I missed... Comfort of the con, of the console itself. Uh huh. Do you think

02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:41.380
that the PSP or the DS is more comfortable? Or are they about the same? I, I like the

02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:46.260
feel of the PSP, because it feels like I'm holding a controller that has a, a, a video

02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:50.140
on it. And so, you know, I have kind of, you know, I'm, I'm six foot two, so I have kind

02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:55.100
of big hands. So, I don't know, it's, the PSP's not really a problem for me. The DS,

02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:59.700
um, it doesn't feel the same to me, because you're using one hand to kind of write. I

02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:04.140
think I actually, to be honest, I like the way the PSP feels a little better, I think.

02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:08.180
I don't like, that's why I don't like DS games that overuse the stylus. Once in a while's

02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:14.220
okay. But if I'm playing a DS game that now is stylus-free and uses the controller, then

02:22:14.220 --> 02:22:21.060
it's cool. I'm, I'm, I'm cool with it. But the square feeling is a little weird. So I,

02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:25.900
I think I actually like the PSP better overall, I gotta admit. Well, just a few more, because

02:22:25.900 --> 02:22:32.380
we really did get a lot of email. Hello, OLR. Another word from Belgium here. My girlfriend

02:22:32.380 --> 02:22:36.500
bought Kinect for my birthday last week. What an amazing piece of technology. For the first

02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:40.220
time ever in six years, my girlfriend enjoys gaming. Yeah, she played other games, but

02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:44.060
found them too complicated because of all the buttons you need to use. Now she even

02:22:44.060 --> 02:22:48.500
asks to game. Truly, this must be heaven. She tested Wii and moved too, but was not

02:22:48.500 --> 02:22:53.500
very interested in it. She thinks both are too limited to control different genres of

02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:58.940
game. Hell, even my father played bowling and Kinect, and he didn't suck at it. Anyways,

02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:03.620
as I stated, Kinect is amazing. Everything Microsoft promised works perfectly. The major

02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:07.980
drawback is the space it needs, though my room is too small to play, to decently play

02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:12.740
Kinect. So I have to move my 360 and Kinect to the living room. But that's not my biggest

02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:18.140
problem. What I was thinking of is this. I fear Microsoft might reveal a Kinect 2 or

02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:25.380
Kinect HD next to E3. It will not need as much space as Kinect needs. Do you think Microsoft

02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:30.540
will announce this early? Do we need to shell out another 150 euros next Christmas? Or will

02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:35.500
they do no such thing and hold onto the spacious Kinect? I don't think the space needed can

02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:39.860
be fixed with a firmware update. I would like to thank you for OLR. You guys really make

02:23:39.860 --> 02:23:44.480
my day. Yours truly, Fabrice. Honestly, you know, I think the third party company is going

02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:50.240
to come out with a solution to this. I think it's actually a lot simpler than it sounds,

02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:56.260
but literally snapping on a lens to the front of that would probably fix that right there.

02:23:56.260 --> 02:24:01.300
Yeah, and your other question about will they announce something new at E3? No. No way.

02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:05.780
Not this soon. This E3 is going to be about now. What is the next wave of games for Kinect?

02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:10.340
I think what Microsoft really needs to do at this year's E3, and the publishers, is

02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:16.680
show us, okay, now we've seen you taking the Wii games and taking them to the next step.

02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:19.340
What are the Kinect games really about now? What are you really going to do with this

02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:24.540
thing? I think that's what this next E3 is about, and what Microsoft has to show. I don't

02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:33.820
see them at all doing a Kinect 2.0. No, not this quick. Maybe a smaller one, like a slim

02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:38.660
remodel type of thing. The budget Kinect. Again, I think it's too soon. Now, maybe a

02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:45.300
price cut for the existing Kinect, that could come out at E3, but I don't see, especially

02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:49.340
this quick. I mean, you're talking like a little over six months after the launch. Not

02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:56.100
going to happen that fast. Now, as far as the next console goes, if Kinect proves popular,

02:24:56.100 --> 02:25:01.700
which so far it is, I would expect that when we get to the Xbox 720 or whatever we call

02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:08.220
it, Kinect will be built in to whatever it is they have planned next. But that whole

02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:15.700
whatever's next is still a good two years out, at least. At least. It's going to come

02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:20.740
a lot sooner from Nintendo than it is the other two. You know, Sony has said time and

02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:24.580
time again, ten year cycle, ten year cycle, ten year cycle. The only one that needs to

02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:29.980
catch up right now is Nintendo. And in some ways, they don't, because they're still selling

02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:33.780
like crazy, because they're kind of the budget system at this point. But I see them going

02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:38.300
more of the route like they do with the DS and the Game Boys and all that stuff, where

02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:43.220
it's something that, it's an upgrade, but it still plays all the old stuff. Yep. I absolutely

02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:49.920
100% think whatever we see next from Nintendo is going to be Wii Evolved. Not throwing out

02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:53.420
the whole Wii concept altogether. The Wii's been a huge seller. It's going to be Wii HD.

02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:58.660
It'll be Wiivolved. Wiivolve. Actually, that'll be the name of the console right there. Trademark

02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:04.820
Dark Sakura. That's right. Trademark. Copyright. Patent pending. Blah, blah, blah. Restricted.com.

02:26:04.820 --> 02:26:14.020
Boobs. Nice. So, uh, next, and I'm only going to do two more. We really did get a lot. Greetings

02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:18.640
Orange Orange Radio. The first thing, I believe you're all mega excited to see Tron Legacy

02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:23.560
in about two weeks. Well, I've been seeing this ad on Facebook, and well, let me pull

02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:33.860
up the ad. It's a big flashy Tron Legacy thing. Dude, that looks like it's going to load the

02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:40.380
old arcade game or something. Flash. I'm trying to see. Light Cycles! I bet that's like a

02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:45.180
Light Cycle arcade game on Facebook or something, huh? Upload your face. Get on the grid. Oh,

02:26:45.180 --> 02:26:51.020
so you can take a picture of your face and put it in this trailer. Oh, that's cute. That's

02:26:51.020 --> 02:26:57.220
like those dancing elves that I see around work every year. I hate the freaking dancing

02:26:57.220 --> 02:27:03.300
elves. The Jib Jab. That's what it's called. I'm going to post this in the chatroom. It's

02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:08.300
basically a face mapping app. If you click on it, you may have to take a picture of your

02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:12.940
face. Note, I said face because it didn't recognize anything else. And know that didn't

02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:18.140
mean I took a picture of my balls. I used my- What if you draw a smiley face on your

02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:25.140
penis? I used my Moby Noggy screenshot of my character. And you get to watch yourself

02:27:25.140 --> 02:27:31.220
get killed by Jeff Bridges. Just thought you'd think it was cool. Second, if I were to start

02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:34.340
World of Warcraft on the original expansion, would I just be locked out of the places or

02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:39.500
should I get Cataclysm and start there? Here's the thing. Cataclysm won't work without the

02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:45.300
regular game. I'm getting a lot of wow questions. Hoardhousepodcast.gmail.com. Just saying. Don't

02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:48.180
you have to have all the other expansions? You do. You do. But here's the thing, and

02:27:48.180 --> 02:27:51.700
a lot of people are missing this. When they released the Cataclysm, when they released

02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:57.940
the Kraken, or Deathwing in this case, they evolved Old World permanently. So if you have

02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:02.500
World of Warcraft and nothing but, if you have Vanilla WoW, you will still get the new

02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:09.900
WoW experience. The Old World is gone. So it makes it a really good experience. There

02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:14.540
are other enhancements that make the Cataclysm worth purchasing, such as- But is Mr. T still

02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:19.780
there? I believe he is. He's not outside the cities anymore, but he'll come back. Such

02:28:19.780 --> 02:28:24.460
as, and just a short list, the ability to level to 85. New dungeons and raids that come

02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:29.620
with that. The fact that you can roll a Worgen or a Goblin, and Worgen is going to be a huge

02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:38.900
race. I mean there's tons of furries that want to play Worgen. I'm half tempted if somebody

02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:43.240
gets me the game to put Star Trek Online aside to give it a try. Well there's one other thing

02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:47.320
I want to throw out there, and that is, now is an excellent time to suck yourself back

02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:51.420
into the World of Warcraft, because Blizzard's been having this huge sale, and I don't know

02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:58.060
if it's over yet or not, but Vanilla WoW, five bucks. Burning Crusade, five bucks. Wrath,

02:28:58.060 --> 02:29:02.860
ten bucks. Twenty bucks gets you caught up to- They even had one. I already had the other

02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:06.260
two, the first two. I'm not sure if it was going on during the sale though, or whatever.

02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:10.420
It was, you buy it at GameStop for fifteen dollars, you get a fifteen dollar gift card.

02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:15.420
You get it for free, basically. Nice. Let me see if that sale is still going on. Dark

02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:20.060
Saga, if that sale is still going on, I will buy you Wrath of the Lich King as a Hanukkah

02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:28.860
present. Okay. I'll give it a try again, I mean, shit. As much as I love Star Trek Online,

02:29:28.860 --> 02:29:36.180
I can alternate months. Excellent. Except I don't want to have to go out and buy Cataclysm.

02:29:36.180 --> 02:29:41.140
I on the other hand will not be joining the World of Warcraft. If you don't have an intro-

02:29:41.140 --> 02:29:46.860
I'm not even going to try with you, you have a baby anyway. I don't join even the actual

02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:51.300
world right now, so. I was just going to say, as long as you don't want to roll a Worgen

02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:55.860
or a Goblin, there's not a lot for you until you get up to level 80. I still have- I have

02:29:55.860 --> 02:30:03.760
a level 20, um, what the fuck are the goat people, Rob? Draenei. Draenei. I have a Russian

02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:09.140
goat people. Not enough rage. Alright, anyhow, Jovidaya on our channel says, all I hear

02:30:09.140 --> 02:30:15.260
is blah blah wow, blah blah vanilla, blah blah blah. Puppies, rainbows, kittens, unicorns.

02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:24.540
Do I have your attention now? Naked men. Choaniki. Choaniki. No, um, I'm going to go finish.

02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:30.640
Okay, third- Majinamicon and other big words I can think of. Alright, um, okay third, can

02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:35.740
you patch a UMD or download PSP import games to English? Because I know that you can do

02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:40.660
that for the DS, so I was wondering. Um, I'm sure within emulator? I don't know if there's

02:30:40.660 --> 02:30:45.820
people that do that, but maybe. It wouldn't be on UMD anymore. You would have to have

02:30:45.820 --> 02:30:50.980
this whole ROM thing and then you're getting into shady hacks. So I'm sure it's possible.

02:30:50.980 --> 02:30:56.660
Don't ever doubt what the hacker community can do, but it just- you'd have to go to the

02:30:56.660 --> 02:31:02.520
darker parts of the internet to find it. Okay, one last thing, DarkSakurai, in Comic

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:06.860
Insanity do you guys talk about anime as well? Typically not unless they have a comic attached

02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:14.860
to them and not necessarily manga. We really focus on Marvel, you know, DC, IDW, Udon,

02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:19.700
basically US-based companies, so. Although we've gone into a little bit of the manga

02:31:19.700 --> 02:31:23.700
before. I think it's one of those, like, inevitables. Like, you know food is going to come up on

02:31:23.700 --> 02:31:28.860
OLR and you know that manga's gotta come up on Comic Insanity once in a while. And, uh,

02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:33.020
He Who Shall Not Be Named on Comic Insanity. And just like, and X-to-Fur's Masturbation

02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:37.300
Habits will come up on Horde House. Just saying. Yes. It says, thank you, and DarkSakurai,

02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:40.140
your grammar coaching is appreciated. Well, if you really appreciated it, you would've

02:31:40.140 --> 02:31:45.620
spelled grammar right. Nice. Let me get some comments from chat. Chat.orangessauceredo.com.

02:31:45.620 --> 02:31:51.380
I love this comment. SSG100Matt says, so Jamie went from World of War crap to I might consider

02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:55.380
playing it over the course of an episode. I might consider playing it if someone else

02:31:55.380 --> 02:31:59.340
buys it for me. This is the awesome thing about Orange Launch Radio. Hey look, last

02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:05.740
week we went from guy tweeting us saying isn't this game cool to having the creator on our

02:32:05.740 --> 02:32:11.340
show hours ago. Every gamer has a voice. I love this show. It's amazing. Uh, DDRDollarBill

02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:17.780
in the chat says, shit, I'm still jonesing for DC Universe to try it out. It's awesome.

02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:23.420
It needs work, but it's awesome. Remember, this is, if someone buys it for me, I would

02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:29.780
play it. Fair enough. And that means I'd have to give up Star Trek Online for a month. And

02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:33.900
I don't want to be kicked out of my fleet. So I still have to think about it. SalaciousPop

02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:38.900
in our chat room says, a UMD rip, which I've used, is like 500 to 900 megabytes. That's

02:32:38.900 --> 02:32:45.380
an awful lot to patch. Also, most torrented PSP games are just disk images, hence UMD

02:32:45.380 --> 02:32:51.460
rip. Text patches actually modify game files. I would have thought, though, because you

02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:56.420
can do it so easily with, you know, like Super Nintendo ROMs and stuff. But then again, what,

02:32:56.420 --> 02:33:01.780
the largest Super Nintendo images are what, 1632 megs? So I can see where it's probably

02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:08.260
a much bigger pain in the ass. But again, don't doubt the hacker community. Where there's

02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:14.740
a will, there's a way. Right? Indeed. Any more emails tonight? Oh, they're still reading

02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:20.540
this email. Oh, my bad. Um, thanks for reading my email. And if you didn't, what the fuck?

02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:26.500
Also, Darsakha, fuck my life. And why would you let Rob lick Dan's balls just to mess

02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:32.660
with you? Remember, Dan made balls last week. We were eating. Did you forget about your

02:33:32.660 --> 02:33:38.300
husband's balls? No, it's just now they're ground beef. Oh. Your loyal listener, Haseo

02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:42.980
Sumiragawa. P.S. Can I get a woot from the Minnesota listeners? Because Garrett Hedlund,

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:48.100
aka Sam Flynn, was born in Rosso, Minnesota, about 100 miles from where I live and pissing

02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:53.500
distance from Canada. Canadian! Tron Legacy officially made of win. All right, let's get

02:33:53.500 --> 02:34:00.000
a woot from the Minnesota listeners. Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. I'm sure they're out

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:06.540
there somewhere. Well, we have one last email. All right. And this one, I, you know, it's,

02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:10.700
okay. I'm just trying to keep away from the political, in charge stuff, but this is a

02:34:10.700 --> 02:34:15.900
good email. With all the homophobia, don't ask, don't tell, Prop 8, among others, why

02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:20.780
does it matter if anyone is gay or not? The way people worry about being gay or being

02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:25.140
near someone gay, I can't help but make the comparison to the X-Men movie and fear people

02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:31.100
had towards mutants. That's where mutants came from, kind of. All the arguments against

02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:35.340
gay marriage, gays in the military, gay teachers, to me, are unfounded and stupid, and the more

02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:39.820
they try to defend their position, by the way, they are spelled T-H-E-I-R, not T-H-E-R-E,

02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:45.260
but position, the more stupid and ignorant they get. Agreed. Except for your spelling.

02:34:45.260 --> 02:34:49.820
I hope one day it just won't matter, there's an apostrophe and won't, and everyone is treated

02:34:49.820 --> 02:34:56.420
the same. I wrote this email after talking this very subject with my wife several times.

02:34:56.420 --> 02:35:01.260
I just can't figure out why it matters if everyday life, in everyday life, if one is

02:35:01.260 --> 02:35:07.260
gay or not. What people do in the privacy of their own homes is their own business,

02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:10.780
and why should it dictate if you can do a job to defend our country or get married?

02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:15.420
Sorry for the email, I'm not gay-related, but I just wanted your opinion on this again.

02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:20.340
And there's a gay-related part, so I'll read that next. I agree with everything. So, you

02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:29.020
missed it earlier, I had my FKHH shirt. Yeah, I mean, what you're saying, I think, is the,

02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:33.900
I don't want to say the right viewpoint, but in a way it's kind of like, in a perfect world,

02:35:33.900 --> 02:35:38.580
where hopefully in the world our children and our grandchildren live in, you're right,

02:35:38.580 --> 02:35:46.180
it won't be a big deal. It's just whatever, no one curr. But I think right now, I think

02:35:46.180 --> 02:35:51.140
sometimes, you know, because there's two extremes to this. There isn't necessarily just the

02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:56.180
homophobic side, but then there is the side that likes to drag people out of the closet,

02:35:56.180 --> 02:36:01.540
so to speak, which I'm not necessarily sure I agree with either. Because there's people

02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:06.660
that don't want it to be that big of a factor, that would prefer not to say that they're

02:36:06.660 --> 02:36:11.380
quote in the closet, but that they just don't make it, they don't, for whatever reason,

02:36:11.380 --> 02:36:14.920
want to make it a huge part of their life. I think that one's life shouldn't necessarily

02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:21.100
be dictated by their sexuality. Yeah, absolutely. It's an aspect of the life, but it's not your

02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:30.220
entire life. I don't go around thinking about, oh, I'm going to fuck Dan every day. Sorry.

02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:39.180
I just like that. Is that what your inner voice sounds like? I'm gonna fuck Dan. No.

02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:47.820
I've been using the redneck voice for Pinkberry too. I'm going Pinkberry. Nice. But no, I'm

02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:55.580
just saying, you know, it's like, I'm going to be, I'm going to, you know, oh, I eat only

02:36:55.580 --> 02:37:01.820
tacos so I'm only going to do things associated with tacos. You know what I mean? Right. It's

02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:09.060
like, okay, you know, if you prefer to sit on the toilet or pee, you know, if you prefer

02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:16.740
to pee standing up or sitting down, guys, is that determine your life? You know what

02:37:16.740 --> 02:37:22.740
I mean though? I'm picking something that, cause some guys prefer to pee sitting down,

02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:28.100
some guys prefer it standing up. When did you choose to pee sitting down? When did you

02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:33.500
choose to pee standing up? When did you choose to be gay? When did you choose to be straight?

02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:41.100
It doesn't matter. Hey, hey, hey, Matt, when did you choose to be straight? Boobies. I

02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:50.180
don't know. When did I choose? I don't think I did choose. Exactly. Point. But Matt's also

02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:55.100
on the side of reasonableness. Matt is where the rest of America needs to be. You know

02:37:55.100 --> 02:38:00.780
what I mean? And generally our listenership I think is on that same page. That is promising

02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:05.420
more than anything. You know, obviously it's no secret on the show. I'm gay. Although,

02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:10.240
Oh my God. But well for the longest time, you know, uh, especially when the show was

02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:15.940
first podcast, when it first came out on the show that I was gay, there was quite a few

02:38:15.940 --> 02:38:20.380
emails about the whole like, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait. Rob's gay. Like, because

02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:25.140
if you remember, well, hold on though. Remember for the longest time we were doing a live

02:38:25.140 --> 02:38:29.140
show and then a separate podcast. So there were a lot of people that were listening to

02:38:29.140 --> 02:38:33.900
the podcast that weren't listening to live show where like the, the other talk was happening.

02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:39.140
Whereas on the podcast until we combine the shows, then it finally came out probably,

02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:42.540
you know, like a year and a half after we've been podcasting. And you know, I'd mentioned

02:38:42.540 --> 02:38:45.940
some guy had been dating or whatever and you know, there was, there was quite a few emails

02:38:45.940 --> 02:38:53.220
that came in that next week. Okay. So I don't remember getting any thing bad. Uh, I got

02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:57.820
one that was a little iffy, like I don't, it wasn't necessarily negative, but it was

02:38:57.820 --> 02:39:02.820
more of like an I'll pray for you thing. And it was kind of one of those, you know, okay,

02:39:02.820 --> 02:39:09.220
thanks but no need. You know, I know that if there's a higher power, I try to live my

02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:15.680
life to the best of moral being that I can and what higher power that is nothing but

02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:20.020
love is going to send me straight to hell to burn for an eternity for trying to be the

02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:26.660
best person I can be. That's a ridiculous way of thinking. Exactly. It's, you know,

02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:36.860
this is the whole way I look at it. It's like, you know, it's, I'm trying to think lifestyle

02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:42.380
is like going out to the clubs and dyeing your hair blue or you know, if you want to

02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:49.660
be seen or, or you know, lifestyle is how you live your life, what you've chosen to

02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:56.980
do with your life. But that's not lifestyle. That's just an aspect. It may contribute to

02:39:56.980 --> 02:40:02.700
your lifestyle, but it's not something that you choose to do. You know what I mean? I'm

02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:05.460
trying to make sense with this. It's not something. I don't mean to laugh at you. I'm laughing

02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:09.940
at chat because you know, Alan said something funny, so I'll read it in a minute. But it's,

02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:15.820
it's just like, it really shouldn't have to do with anything. It shouldn't be a big deal.

02:40:15.820 --> 02:40:21.820
It shouldn't be anybody else's freaking business. Uh, let's see. Salacious Pop in our chat room

02:40:21.820 --> 02:40:27.340
says, quote, I will inform Jesus ASAP of your wrongdoing so that he may send his Healy vagina

02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:31.860
beams at you so that you can go to heaven because I'm concerned about you so much. Look,

02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:35.500
and I don't mean to mock religion. I think there's a lot of good stuff that can come

02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:40.540
out of religion, but unfortunately there's also a lot of bad stuff that can come out.

02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:43.580
You know what I mean though? You know what I mean? I never want to disrespect somebody's

02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:49.980
religion until that religion disrespects me. Right? Well, and I'm going to plug this once

02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:53.300
on the show because I think that everyone who listens to it actually get a lot of good

02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:57.460
out of this. There's um, and I follow him on Facebook and I've actually plugged the

02:40:57.460 --> 02:41:04.060
podcast. The guy's name is John Shore. He's an evangelical Christian. He did a movie called

02:41:04.060 --> 02:41:10.420
Lord save us from your followers. And the whole movie is basically him actually going

02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:14.700
out and striking up conversations with people to find out why they don't like Christians,

02:41:14.700 --> 02:41:19.060
why they have a problem with evangelicals, you know, actually just going in and asking

02:41:19.060 --> 02:41:27.700
questions. And you know, meeting, he went to San Francisco to Castro to talk to people.

02:41:27.700 --> 02:41:32.220
Quite a few fabulous drag queens on there too. But I mean the whole, the whole point

02:41:32.220 --> 02:41:40.420
is that it's like you need to stop being right and start respecting other people. It's, you

02:41:40.420 --> 02:41:45.820
know, that close minded, Oh, this is the only way it can be. Maybe it's because the Bible

02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:49.660
said this or maybe my pastor said this. This is the only way it is and all the rest of

02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:54.260
you are wrong. That is no way that's going to automatically close the door on anything

02:41:54.260 --> 02:41:58.940
you have to say. Excellent point. One other thing I want to say on this and I swear we

02:41:58.940 --> 02:42:03.620
can get back to games, but um, you know, whatever we're, we're allowed to get on off topic grants

02:42:03.620 --> 02:42:08.460
once in a while because I clearly don't ask, don't tell on the whole hubba loo about that

02:42:08.460 --> 02:42:11.800
right now in America motivated this email. Like, yeah, I think there was a party said

02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:16.180
talking about to the wife about serving and all that. So clearly there was some motivation

02:42:16.180 --> 02:42:21.860
by that whole hot topic. And the thing that gets me and the just, just the idiot perspective

02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:27.460
and the people that have the biggest problem, I think sometimes with homosexuality and even

02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:31.660
so much what they're saying, the problem is with don't ask or, or the, or why they need

02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:38.340
don't ask, don't tell is that straight men or certain straight men are threatened because

02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:43.900
they don't want guys checking them out. They don't want other guys checking them out. And

02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:50.940
there's a part of me that goes, A, get over yourself. Do you know, uh, there's probably

02:42:50.940 --> 02:42:56.460
a lot of people that don't care less just because someone's gay. I don't find every

02:42:56.460 --> 02:43:01.300
guy in the world hot just because I happen to be gay. In fact, there's, there's quite

02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:09.140
a few ugly ones out there. I hate to say it. Uh, but you just, when people kind of have

02:43:09.140 --> 02:43:13.100
that perspective of like, well, I hope he's not gay cause I'm not, he's going to try to

02:43:13.100 --> 02:43:17.580
put in my butt. I'm just, I just think like you're the one with issues if that's your

02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:23.740
line of thinking, like why is that such a big deal to you? Why does that, I mean what

02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:27.960
ultimately boils down to a compliment, right? When somebody likes you, that's a compliment.

02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:35.300
Why does that make you so freaky? Are they so scared? What was the word? Are they so

02:43:35.300 --> 02:43:40.420
insecure? Yeah, insecure. That's the perfect word. Well, and you know, it's, it's actually

02:43:40.420 --> 02:43:47.620
a proven psychological point that a lot of people, not everybody, do have some homosexual

02:43:47.620 --> 02:43:54.620
tendencies. There can be a level of attraction. You may not fully, I guess, swing that way

02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:58.400
to use the quote, but it has been proven. There's studies out there that everyone carries

02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:02.300
a little bit. I mean, if, if not for you, I mean, and I've said, I don't know that I've

02:44:02.300 --> 02:44:06.380
made this completely, but I've talked to you about it before, but I mean, if not for Dan,

02:44:06.380 --> 02:44:14.100
I could easily have had a girlfriend. I've had flings, you know, I, I have, I'm completely

02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:21.420
attracted to everybody I guess, you know. Um, but it's not like I'm going to go up to

02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:28.420
someone and go boobies. Really? Cause I think you did that once and you were drunk. I did.

02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:33.020
Just kidding. I will say one and I've told you this off the air before, but it did kind

02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:42.420
of gross me out when I saw you kiss a girl. That's so wrong. But I have, you were drunk.

02:44:42.420 --> 02:44:51.060
I have kissed women. Yeah. Big deal. But it was dumb fun. It was, I'm not saying it grossed

02:44:51.060 --> 02:44:55.060
me out. I'm just like, that's so weird. I know. I know. It was funny. But yeah, back

02:44:55.060 --> 02:45:00.020
to the point. Yeah, it's, it's, it's interesting. But what, there was one other thing I want

02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:04.400
to say about this. Oh, oh, here's the thing. If you're that guy that's really afraid of

02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:09.200
another guy hitting on you or whatever, let me, here's a simple line to use. If, if somebody

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:13.700
ever reveals to you their secret man crush on you, brings you on the, on the local talk

02:45:13.700 --> 02:45:19.940
show to out their crush or whatever on you. Thanks, but no thanks. I'll tell you what,

02:45:19.940 --> 02:45:23.180
straight people have been using that line for a long time. Gay people use that line

02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:29.260
with each other too. Thanks, but no thanks. Right? Yeah. If somebody says they have a

02:45:29.260 --> 02:45:33.380
crush on you, but you know, you, you just don't feel that same way or, or you happen

02:45:33.380 --> 02:45:36.940
to already be in a relationship or married or something, no matter what the two genders

02:45:36.940 --> 02:45:41.780
are. Thanks, but no thanks. It was like, remember great America when I went to gay day at great

02:45:41.780 --> 02:45:48.900
America and the girl was in the bathroom and said I was cute. I was like, Oh, thank you.

02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:54.340
I'm taken. It was that easy. I mean, I wasn't expecting it. You came out of there and you

02:45:54.340 --> 02:45:59.940
were like, Oh, Hey, I'm looking hot today. Well, you were there. You saw, I was tickled

02:45:59.940 --> 02:46:05.900
all day. I was like, she thought I was nice to get a compliment. I know it's not, I mean,

02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:10.140
I was like, that's so cool. I mean, there wouldn't be a single person in this universe

02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:15.180
I would cheat on, you know, while I'm with Dan, I would never. What about Margaret Cho

02:46:15.180 --> 02:46:22.500
circa 10 years ago? Nah. All right. I, you know, I am completely and utterly dedicated

02:46:22.500 --> 02:46:29.820
to my husband. You are completely and utterly dedicated to Alan and Matt here is completely

02:46:29.820 --> 02:46:40.860
and utterly dedicated to his phone right now. That's correct. You clearly love your wife

02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:49.340
very much. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. But I'm saying, you know, all of us in this room,

02:46:49.340 --> 02:46:56.740
we have found our person. We were very happy people. You know, it's we, we have that level

02:46:56.740 --> 02:47:00.780
of security that even if we weren't with our significant others that we'd just say, you

02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:07.460
know, thanks, but no. All right. I want to say this in the chat because this is so good.

02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:12.620
Brad says, if someone is checking you out, be flattered. Now, if they stalk you different

02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:16.520
story. Absolutely right. And it doesn't matter what the genders are in that case too, because

02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:21.380
that stalking is when it crosses the line when thanks, no thanks. Doesn't get the message

02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:28.380
across like it should to most reasonable people. That's a whole nother problem. And that is

02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:35.040
free of whatever sexuality happens to be the case. Yes. Stocking is never cool. So if someone

02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:43.020
tells you thanks, but no thanks, try, try for a friendship or go fishing again. I've

02:47:43.020 --> 02:47:46.340
had times where the first time I've been like, no, I'm not really insured. They came back

02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:50.460
a week later and said, you know what? I'm, I'm, I still would really like try. Will you

02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:54.660
give me a chance? I'm going to be okay. You know? All right. I'll give you a chance. The

02:47:54.660 --> 02:48:02.180
third time. No, that's creepy. I I'm, I'm kind of okay with the second try, but after

02:48:02.180 --> 02:48:09.380
that, no. Oh my God. There was this one time I'm getting texted. Oh, nevermind. We're going

02:48:09.380 --> 02:48:14.340
to print tomorrow for the American overview. So what time the print is. So, but it's like

02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:20.220
when I was working at Aladdin's castle in Mobile, Alabama, this guy comes in and he's

02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:29.700
like, Hey, you're cute. I'll go out with you. I'll be here to pick you up when you off work.

02:48:29.700 --> 02:48:36.540
And I was like, I am taking, this is right when Dan and I were first, you know, considering

02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:40.940
each other, but I was like, dude, I'm not interested. I was like, thank you, but no,

02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:44.700
I'm not interested. I'm going to be here. Well, I'll have you know that our security

02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:53.100
guard is an ex army ranger and I'll be calling him to be here. So the guy didn't show up,

02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:59.780
but I'm saying, but I'm saying, you know, you've got to be confident in yourself and

02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:05.420
take it as a compliment. If someone is checking you out, go, yeah, huh? In your head. And

02:49:05.420 --> 02:49:09.620
you know, if you're not interested with them, go, no, thank you. If they're not loony and

02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:15.640
crazy and you know, bizarre and shocking, then they'll go, well, okay. Make sad face

02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:20.300
puppy eyes at you and then go pout. But if again, just to try and bring closer to this,

02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:23.900
if you're one of those guys or, or girls or whatever, that's I want someone of the same

02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:28.140
gender checking me out, then you know what? Your attitude is probably not attractive and

02:49:28.140 --> 02:49:33.500
no one is probably checking you out. Just food for thought. Well, the game part of the

02:49:33.500 --> 02:49:37.260
email. Okay. Game related stuff. Earth Defense Force is one of my favorite games and can't

02:49:37.260 --> 02:49:42.620
wait for Earth Defense Force to hope it is online co-op. Great ship. It is online co-op

02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:48.660
three player ratio. Keep up the great work and honestly, and the honesty you have toward

02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:54.740
life and gaming. Oh, that's a compliment. The honesty we have towards life and gaming.

02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:59.460
This has been a week of warm fuzzies for as far as like compliments go and so forth. And

02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:04.180
I realize it's not been a warm fuzzy week for everybody out there in the world. Uh,

02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:07.760
what with just God, the economy in general. And it seems like we always have these stories

02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:12.340
about closures and you know, other things. It makes me feel tingly, but it's, it's, it

02:50:12.340 --> 02:50:16.820
does feel nice to get paid a compliment. We've been paid several this week and totally unsolicited.

02:50:16.820 --> 02:50:22.300
I would like my next compliment in the form of money. Stop. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

02:50:22.300 --> 02:50:27.420
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Any other emails tonight? Too many. I I'm done. Well,

02:50:27.420 --> 02:50:30.540
sorry to those didn't get through. You just unfortunately just picked the wrong week.

02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:35.940
I guess male bag of orange on trader.com. Try again. We'll get to you at some point.

02:50:35.940 --> 02:50:39.100
All right. This is the part of the show where we do the FUs of the week. I know it sounds

02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:41.980
weird. I just talked about like, Oh, what a warm fuzzy week. And I'm like, all right,

02:50:41.980 --> 02:51:06.820
time to rant. But here we go. You all right over there? I'm fine. Um, F you to, uh, you

02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:12.980
know, not that recording podcasts all day was that bad, but F you to how tired I feel

02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:18.580
after all that and how my throat hurts. But it's big. Thank you to Tiara for editing the

02:51:18.580 --> 02:51:26.060
first podcast for me. Thank you. So yeah, mine's kind of warm and fuzzy too. Not cold

02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:36.900
and sandpapery. I'm done. Loki, uh, if he this stupid overclock program, cause he only

02:51:36.900 --> 02:51:42.220
knows how to underclock and that's not what I want. Uh, my view of the week goes to traffic

02:51:42.220 --> 02:51:46.420
and people that don't know how to drive in the rain. My God, some of you California people

02:51:46.420 --> 02:51:50.260
are so spoiled. Like the rain here is nothing and just, it rains and people know what they're

02:51:50.260 --> 02:51:56.820
doing. So F you to that. And then F you to the fact that I just, I have a very, very

02:51:56.820 --> 02:52:05.020
busy week and weeks ahead and not necessarily bad, but yeah, F you to the fact that I can't

02:52:05.020 --> 02:52:12.220
just sit on my ass and be lazy all day. Some days that's what I want to do. All right.

02:52:12.220 --> 02:52:16.140
Anyhow, let's move on to a couple more stories and we're going to open up the Skyline one

02:52:16.140 --> 02:52:22.780
eight seven seven game O L R but not just yet. Don't say that to the chatters. No, not

02:52:22.780 --> 02:52:27.780
the chatters. No, it's having to be the print preview at eight 45 in the morning, which

02:52:27.780 --> 02:52:32.820
I guess is better than six in the morning. Oh, you have to get up early tomorrow. Fucking

02:52:32.820 --> 02:52:40.220
a lame. All right. How about some more stories? I'm looking forward to going Loki. All right.

02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:53.260
Um, so this is neat. Uh, actually the Michael Jackson game. Now I'm not necessarily one

02:52:53.260 --> 02:52:57.540
going to get it on the DS, maybe the Wii, maybe the connect and stuff when that comes

02:52:57.540 --> 02:53:02.540
out because it's supposed to be just like just dance. But uh, for the DS of course there's,

02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:09.180
they've done some very specific things. If you try to say pirate the ROM, um, this is

02:53:09.180 --> 02:53:12.580
kind of neat and I know Jamie will get kicked out of this. Uh, one of the things that they

02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:19.140
do first off is they have a vuvuzela, uh, playing on top of all the songs during the

02:53:19.140 --> 02:53:25.420
game. And then of course they render the games touch screen, um, nonfunctional. So you don't

02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:30.940
get to play the game and you don't get to listen to the music untainted by the vuvuzela.

02:53:30.940 --> 02:53:35.680
So that's good. I love it. I want to do that just for the vuvuzela. I have to admit as

02:53:35.680 --> 02:53:39.980
much as I hate it when she breaks it out on the show. I think that is a really funny anti-piracy

02:53:39.980 --> 02:53:43.580
measure. And I think more companies, you know, if they want to fight, fight piracy, they

02:53:43.580 --> 02:53:53.500
should be doing it this way. Actually, actually I will have, have you know this. Uh, I actually

02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:57.940
played a real vuvuzela this week. Uh, one of my friends was having a birthday party

02:53:57.940 --> 02:54:02.380
and one of the other friends that came to the party brought a vuvuzela with her. And

02:54:02.380 --> 02:54:06.660
so, uh, I played it and it took me a minute to figure out how to play it. Like the first

02:54:06.660 --> 02:54:12.380
couple of times I was doing it, it just kind of sounded like a really loud, wet fart. But

02:54:12.380 --> 02:54:17.180
once I was able to get it, it was kind of fun. So there you go. What are you taking

02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:22.060
pictures of me for? What's this for? Are you gonna take my soul? All right. She's stealing

02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:30.180
your soul. Your soul is hers. Dead air. I don't know what she's doing. I downloaded

02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:35.500
an iPhone app that's like fat booth program. Cause I'm going to be, no, it isn't. It does

02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:45.820
gal style here. I'm going to put that on the website. Yes. I think, I think then I should

02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:54.780
get to do the unicorn pick of you. All right. I'll do the unicorn picture here in a minute.

02:54:54.780 --> 02:54:57.820
Tiger claw in our chat says, I'm Rob. That isn't one of them. Mozilla sounds like a wet

02:54:57.820 --> 02:55:04.060
fart. I know I was playing it wrong. I told you. All right. A better hairstyle. One more

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:07.500
story for you guys. And then I got to take the picture of the unicorn. So look, he's

02:55:07.500 --> 02:55:10.980
going to have to take the calls tonight. All right. Anyhow, this is a game. And I don't,

02:55:10.980 --> 02:55:21.260
I don't even know what to think of this. Um, it's a game called cock out and it's a, you

02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:26.860
need a minute. All right. It's a German AIDS awareness organization who released this game.

02:55:26.860 --> 02:55:31.780
It's called cock out, uh, and where players will actually slip on a motion sensing digital

02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:39.080
condom and use their thrust to pummel a virtual HIV. Really? This is for real. This has gotta

02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:42.820
be a joke, right? Commercial is hilarious. Well, there's an actual commercial out there

02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:47.860
on the internet, uh, that has, um, booty in it. So dark soccer, did you see all this booty

02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:53.860
in the commercial here? Yes, I did. I'm surprised you're not still giggling. And it's just basically

02:55:53.860 --> 02:55:58.380
all these guys, uh, that look like they're whacking it. And, uh, I guess they're supposed

02:55:58.380 --> 02:56:02.980
to be playing this game. Now, the part that gets me is that, okay, I just reported on

02:56:02.980 --> 02:56:07.980
this and it's all over the game blogs and so forth. What's the actual game? Why are

02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:13.240
all these guys looking like they're jerking it? Is that, that's it? Is there any type

02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:20.700
of strategy or anything to it or any, why am I asking these questions? Of course not.

02:56:20.700 --> 02:56:27.860
Why am I even bothering, right? Why are you taking another picture of me? All right, hurry,

02:56:27.860 --> 02:56:33.380
hurry up. Loki, can you give the phone information while she takes this damn picture? So, uh,

02:56:33.380 --> 02:56:42.260
to Skype us, you need 1-877-GAME-OLR and, um, do that via Skype or via the 1-800 number.

02:56:42.260 --> 02:56:45.500
You are so great. And then, uh, on Skype, what was it? Orange Lounge Radio? Orange Lounge

02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:52.140
Radio. Oh, we're on Skype. Or 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our, uh, Skype line is now open. Give us a

02:56:52.140 --> 02:57:00.860
call. There you go. Loki, do you have any, uh, maybe you need one of those pictures of

02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:06.500
Loki. Do you have any last minute stories for us, Loki? No, I'm not next. I'm sorry,

02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:10.660
uh, you must have your mistake with somebody else. All right, I'm gonna get the Darkstalkers

02:57:10.660 --> 02:57:14.620
unicorn picture real quick here. Uh, so, in the meantime, uh, do you have any last minute

02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:18.660
stories while we wait for some calls? Well, I was just gonna mention how awesome, uh,

02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:23.500
Swords in Poker 2 is on the iOS platform. Definitely need to check that out. If you

02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:28.660
haven't already, it's a pretty awesome role-playing game and, uh, I'm not getting paid by them,

02:57:28.660 --> 02:57:33.080
which is disappointing because I could really use extra money. I mean, who can't use extra

02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:37.740
money? And hopefully that's bought me enough time to get into the forum to where the extra

02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:41.180
stories are. Because I have not been looking for extra stories, I have been playing with

02:57:41.180 --> 02:57:51.860
my phone. And, uh, of course, um, awesome. What the hell is this? Apparently there is

02:57:51.860 --> 02:57:58.500
a NASCAR Superstar driving game that will let you race dumpsters. That's pretty funny.

02:57:58.500 --> 02:58:05.700
Um, yeah, uh, Jimmy Johnson's Anything with an Engine is a brand new game and apparently

02:58:05.700 --> 02:58:10.540
lives up to its name and you can race a dumpster with a rocket apparently on it. That is pretty

02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:16.700
awesome. Um, also, I'm not sure if anyone saw this this week, uh, I'm sure a lot of

02:58:16.700 --> 02:58:21.580
people have, the custom Tron bikes that they had out there, the light cycles, pretty awesome

02:58:21.580 --> 02:58:26.620
except for the fact that they don't glow. They're completely unrideable. Uh, not unrideable.

02:58:26.620 --> 02:58:31.460
They look way uncomfortable. Well. And then just like you have to push them to get them

02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:34.700
going and you don't fall over. They should've made the new, how they have that four-wheel

02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:39.820
vehicle that they have now. Yeah. They should've made that instead. Well, how, how the crap

02:58:39.820 --> 02:58:49.540
do you, do you change the tire? You can't. It's a custom tire. See? Waste of money. Um,

02:58:49.540 --> 02:58:53.900
I was gonna mention DJ Hero 2. They've got some, uh, new download content coming out

02:58:53.900 --> 02:58:58.860
for that, which is pretty exciting. Uh, especially since it's got more Prodigy in it and one

02:58:58.860 --> 02:59:03.900
of the songs I was hoping to make it into the game to begin with, uh, that didn't, but

02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:10.020
now it has. Uh, Invaders Must Die mixed with, um, Debaser from the Pixies. That's kinda

03:00:00.220 --> 03:00:03.620
Okay, I have a call sitting on hold, sorry. Uh, caller, you're on the air. Hi, you're

03:00:03.620 --> 03:00:07.660
on Orange House Radio. Who's this? It's Rama, and this time I wasn't even trying to get

03:00:07.660 --> 03:00:10.580
on before everybody else. I knew, you know what, I was so distracted because I was taking

03:00:10.580 --> 03:00:14.020
the picture of Jamie and making a unicorn out of her because I'm looking at these, what

03:00:14.020 --> 03:00:18.980
the hell are these pictures on the website? You have problems. You know you love them.

03:00:18.980 --> 03:00:22.540
I look like a Para Para girl in these versions. That's exactly it. I'm gonna make this my

03:00:22.540 --> 03:00:29.540
Facebook picture. I love that. You should totally do it, Rama. I will. Uh, sorry, Rama.

03:00:29.540 --> 03:00:33.380
So, so anyway, check OrangeHouseRadio.com in just a few seconds because I should have

03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:37.460
Jamie's unicorn picture up there in a minute where it looks like the cat is jerking off

03:00:37.460 --> 03:00:41.460
her horn. It's amazing. Alright. Hi, Rama, how are you?

03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:48.460
Um, um, yeah. Damn it, Scott. You sure don't have a way of derailing, don't you?

03:00:48.660 --> 03:00:52.260
Yeah, well, you know what, look, I just want to point out, I want to remind you, our guest

03:00:52.260 --> 03:00:58.660
tonight made a game called Techno Kitten Adventure. Which I downloaded. What'd you think?

03:00:58.660 --> 03:01:03.540
I haven't played it yet because I found a moe Japanese game on the live marketplace,

03:01:03.540 --> 03:01:07.060
downloaded that, and had my roommate playing it for the last 20 minutes.

03:01:07.060 --> 03:01:08.260
Nice. Yes.

03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:12.340
Sorry, I'm looking at Jamie's picture. Tonight's been a great night for pictures.

03:01:12.340 --> 03:01:16.820
Anyway, excuse me. Uh, so what did you call in to talk about tonight?

03:01:17.380 --> 03:01:20.740
I really want to talk about a couple of things, but it turns into a lot of things,

03:01:20.740 --> 03:01:26.900
but I'll make it short and sweet as possible. Number one, this whole German age thing,

03:01:26.900 --> 03:01:31.380
for obvious reasons, I'm kind of sort of offended by it, but I'll let that be.

03:01:31.380 --> 03:01:34.660
Wait, why are you offended by this? It's just whackin'.

03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:38.180
Um, let's just say I have people in my family who have died of said disease.

03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:42.100
I see. So you find this to be disrespectful?

03:01:42.100 --> 03:01:42.740
Yeah.

03:01:42.740 --> 03:01:48.500
Hmm. Okay, interesting. This is interesting because, well,

03:01:50.420 --> 03:01:56.100
is it just disrespectful because it seems to be so trashy and in your face type of thing, or what is it?

03:01:56.100 --> 03:01:58.580
That pretty much is the case.

03:02:00.100 --> 03:02:03.060
What do you think about this whole, I've got to pick your brain on this,

03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:07.620
and I'm sorry because I know this is a sensitive issue to you, but I want to ask this question

03:02:07.620 --> 03:02:10.820
because this is something that's been on my mind this week and it really has nothing to do with

03:02:10.820 --> 03:02:15.860
gaming, but whatever. It's been an interesting part B tonight. Have you seen that whole campaign

03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:22.500
of the celebrities who have quit Twitter to try and raise a million dollars for AIDS awareness

03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:28.500
where they're all lying in the coffins dead and so forth? What do you think of that whole thing?

03:02:29.700 --> 03:02:35.380
I think it was quite ridiculous and I don't know if you saw, but on my personal Facebook page,

03:02:35.380 --> 03:02:39.460
I made a statement about that and a few people agreed with me about it.

03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:40.340
No, I missed it.

03:02:41.540 --> 03:02:45.860
I'll link it to you later. I have made a personal statement about how I truly felt.

03:02:46.580 --> 03:02:50.020
And can you summarize it or am I getting a little too-

03:02:50.020 --> 03:02:56.900
Long story short, I understand this epidemic, but instead of dealing with the whole world event,

03:02:56.900 --> 03:03:02.900
let's take care of the America first. Let's take care of that AIDS issue and the US first before

03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:07.540
we go running around taking care of everybody else. Why give all that money to those world

03:03:07.540 --> 03:03:12.660
charities when you can send that same amount of money to American charities for the same cause?

03:03:13.220 --> 03:03:18.820
Well, I would hope that we can find a cure and that'll be good for everybody. That's my hope.

03:03:18.820 --> 03:03:22.260
All right. Well, I didn't mean to derail, but-

03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:22.900
That's cool.

03:03:22.900 --> 03:03:25.860
What else is on your mind tonight besides potentially offensive games?

03:03:26.580 --> 03:03:30.500
The whole thing about people not being able to get over themselves because

03:03:30.500 --> 03:03:35.460
guys make these compliments and so forth, if I had an issue with that,

03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:41.700
I wouldn't be able to go to conventions because half the people I roll with are gay,

03:03:41.700 --> 03:03:45.860
lesbian, transgender. We have a good time. We go to the cause, we party,

03:03:45.860 --> 03:03:51.380
we drink our asses off. It's all good. When I was working in Staples, I had a couple of

03:03:51.380 --> 03:03:55.700
gay guys I used to hang with who always compliment me and like, you know,

03:03:56.260 --> 03:04:01.140
mack on me, so on and so forth. I thought it was amusing and so did they. I had no problem with it.

03:04:01.700 --> 03:04:07.060
Right. Like I'm sure, you know, a lot of straight people have that friend of the opposite gender,

03:04:07.060 --> 03:04:13.140
like a guy, a straight guy has that girl that he flirts with, but it's nothing more than that,

03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:19.300
you know? I'm sure there's, you probably have girls, not just gay guys, but girlfriends,

03:04:19.300 --> 03:04:22.420
not, I don't know, friend girls that you do that with too, you know?

03:04:23.300 --> 03:04:27.700
Yeah. Let's just say I did that one time and let's just say the two girls ended up having,

03:04:27.700 --> 03:04:31.460
um, lap dance with each other. This was at a convention a couple of years ago. I was like,

03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:32.340
holy shit, I'm good.

03:04:32.340 --> 03:04:35.460
Well, now you're just talking about an anime convention and everybody,

03:04:35.460 --> 03:04:44.820
everybody there is just horny. It's not really a gay or straight issue. It's just a horny issue.

03:04:44.820 --> 03:04:47.140
Wow. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll give you that.

03:04:47.140 --> 03:04:50.340
All right. Anything else on your mind before I let you go and get more calls?

03:04:50.340 --> 03:04:54.180
I played that, that rom hack of Super Mario Brothers 3. That thing is

03:04:54.180 --> 03:04:56.020
three levels below asshole Mario.

03:04:59.300 --> 03:05:03.140
Three levels below, huh? That's a pretty precise rating. All right.

03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:07.380
All right. I got to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for your insight tonight.

03:05:07.380 --> 03:05:12.660
I appreciate it. Take care, buddy. You know, I was just telling the significant other,

03:05:12.660 --> 03:05:15.700
we really need to go to New York city. And when we go, we're crashing with Rama

03:05:16.580 --> 03:05:20.660
or as extra for would say, Randy. So you better be careful. Cause uh,

03:05:20.660 --> 03:05:23.780
I really want to get back to New York city. It's been a very long time. And my one friend

03:05:23.780 --> 03:05:28.660
that lived there moved to Texas. So I'm coming to, I'm coming to the couches of OLR listeners.

03:05:28.660 --> 03:05:36.820
One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is orange lounge radio. All one word.

03:05:36.820 --> 03:05:39.620
If you want to give us a call, we probably got time for about one more call. We are running a

03:05:39.620 --> 03:05:44.740
little long tonight. So, uh, probably because the interview earlier, um, meanwhile, while we wait

03:05:44.740 --> 03:05:48.420
for the phone to ring, Loki, do you have any other last minute stories? I don't know if you spent

03:05:48.420 --> 03:05:53.860
them all or what? I've only done one of them. So no, I haven't spent them. All right. Then what

03:05:53.860 --> 03:06:00.980
else? Uh, let's see. What else can we talk about here? How about, uh, let me just look up here.

03:06:02.100 --> 03:06:11.700
Why is it open? It's odd. Um, hold on. Somehow it navigated while I wait for your riveting

03:06:11.700 --> 03:06:17.620
last minute stories. Let me go to at least one more call here. Oh my God. Oh, hello. Hi.

03:06:17.620 --> 03:06:23.860
Yes, it's Legend of Zaku here. Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, Legend of Zaku. Oh my God. What's

03:06:23.860 --> 03:06:28.820
on your mind? Uh, nothing much. Just trying to kill a Sunday at night before heading to work

03:06:28.820 --> 03:06:33.380
tomorrow. But yeah, you know, a lot of games came out in the past couple of weeks, you know,

03:06:34.180 --> 03:06:38.900
that I've been trying, you know, dying to talk about. Like obviously Gran Turismo 5,

03:06:38.900 --> 03:06:45.460
even though I don't have a PS3 yet, that's on my top list right now. And so we're basically just

03:06:45.460 --> 03:06:51.140
trying to catch up on some other 360 games that I haven't been able to play. Let's just say I managed

03:06:51.140 --> 03:06:56.340
to get a 360 again. Well, talk to us. What have you been playing? Playing catch up again. What

03:06:56.340 --> 03:07:02.740
have you been playing? Um, when I didn't have my 360, it was nothing but like Left 4 Dead and

03:07:02.740 --> 03:07:08.020
battlefields on my computer. But now I'm just playing, you know, small stuff like Sonic 4,

03:07:08.020 --> 03:07:15.940
Ace Combat 6, Resident Evil 5. Although hopefully my girlfriend will hook me up with more recent

03:07:15.940 --> 03:07:20.340
games for Christmas. I've already gave her a wishlist of what to get me. Is that what you

03:07:20.340 --> 03:07:25.140
asked Santa for? Well, yes, Santa the four of my girlfriends is willing to spend money on me,

03:07:25.140 --> 03:07:29.540
just as I'm willing to spend money on her. Okay, very cool. Well, tell us about like,

03:07:29.540 --> 03:07:32.740
what's your favorite game been that you've discovered in the past couple of weeks since

03:07:32.740 --> 03:07:37.860
you got your 360 back? I don't know. I mean, Sonic 4 has been really challenging so far.

03:07:37.860 --> 03:07:42.420
Really? There's been a lot of hate on Sonic 4. There's been a lot a lot of hate on Sonic 4.

03:07:42.420 --> 03:07:46.660
Do you disagree? You think the game's awesome? No, it kind of feels like a classic Sonic game.

03:07:46.660 --> 03:07:53.060
I know it still has elements from the recent ones, like the whole homing attack thing. I mean,

03:07:53.060 --> 03:07:57.700
I could do without it, but it's just, you're right. Some may say it's not fluid enough,

03:07:57.700 --> 03:08:01.700
because it doesn't, it's not, it's not like the old fashioned Sonic where the screen would just

03:08:01.700 --> 03:08:07.380
like literally breeze by every time he just like, every time he literally moves. So yeah,

03:08:07.380 --> 03:08:12.420
he's gonna have some sense, he's gonna have some hate from those classic fans, and I'm one of them

03:08:12.420 --> 03:08:18.740
because I grew up on that. But on the other hand, it's just, it's much spiffier now. I mean,

03:08:18.740 --> 03:08:22.500
the important thing is that Sega managed to maintain the mechanics more or less,

03:08:22.500 --> 03:08:26.260
so you gotta give them credit for not, you know, screwing their pooch yet again.

03:08:28.020 --> 03:08:32.500
Okay, all right. What do you think of the new one, and I apologize, you might have mentioned

03:08:32.500 --> 03:08:37.780
it a little bit. What about Sonic Colors? I haven't played that game yet since I don't own

03:08:37.780 --> 03:08:44.980
a Wii or DS, but I, from what I've seen, it's probably the same gameplay. It's mostly platform

03:08:44.980 --> 03:08:49.540
now, from what I hear. I mean, 2D platform. There's been a lot of people saying Sonic

03:08:49.540 --> 03:08:56.020
Colors is where it's at right now in the Sonic universe, so. Right, I mean, I guess because it's

03:08:56.020 --> 03:09:02.420
like, you know, I don't know, I guess it maintains the same type of gameplay. As I said, I've never

03:09:02.420 --> 03:09:07.460
played Sonic Colors yet, and that's one thing I need, a Wii. I should have bought one when it was

03:09:07.460 --> 03:09:11.300
a hundred bucks at GameStop over Black Friday. You never know when they might do the next price

03:09:11.300 --> 03:09:14.580
cut. I don't know if they'll get that low, but then again, the PS2 can take that low. No, but

03:09:14.580 --> 03:09:18.900
I mean, that was for used systems. I could have, just like I picked up a used 360 for a hundred

03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:27.060
bucks. Alright. Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Legend of Zaku? DDRX2 is going to,

03:09:27.060 --> 03:09:34.340
well, they're taking orders for it. It's supposed to ship out in two weeks. So, every, it's just,

03:09:35.060 --> 03:09:41.220
so far, it's shaping up to be pretty solid at this point. You know, fears about, like,

03:09:41.220 --> 03:09:45.300
drifting arrows and what the, you know, the community was saying about, like,

03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:50.340
being off sync. They're starting to get quelled every, you know, as we speak right now. They've

03:09:50.340 --> 03:09:55.060
already, let's just say the Konami's already taken folks from Bomani Style and already proven to

03:09:55.060 --> 03:10:00.900
them that the final build of the game will be rock solid and something that the hardcores will

03:10:00.900 --> 03:10:06.980
definitely start playing. Assuming the arcades shell out 10 grand for a new machine, which is

03:10:06.980 --> 03:10:10.740
the only way you're going to get the new game. Or, unless you already have X, then you get the

03:10:10.740 --> 03:10:16.820
upgrade. Alright. Well, by the way, you need to check out Home, because they have DDR machines

03:10:16.820 --> 03:10:20.820
in Home, but you don't really get to play DDR on them. But I giggled when I saw the X2 machines

03:10:20.820 --> 03:10:27.940
in the Konami home space. Yeah, and hopefully, you know, assuming I get my Christmas bonus this

03:10:27.940 --> 03:10:32.660
year, I will definitely shell out money on a PS3. Alright. Alright, buddy, we're going to let you

03:10:32.660 --> 03:10:37.540
go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call. Alright, take care. Bye! Alright,

03:10:37.540 --> 03:10:40.100
that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. I'm sorry to those that didn't get through,

03:10:40.100 --> 03:10:43.620
but we kind of are running along a little bit tonight, and we still want to get to the

03:10:43.620 --> 03:10:48.260
afterbirth and all that good stuff. So, email us your thoughts. Mailbag at orangeontrader.com,

03:10:48.260 --> 03:10:53.620
or send us tweets. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Meanwhile, we got to wrap it up, put the nail

03:10:53.620 --> 03:10:57.540
in the coffin of the show. Do we have any last minute stories, Loki? Yeah, real quick. This is

03:10:57.540 --> 03:11:02.900
kind of cool. From the same guy that did the Left 4 Dead demake, you know, kind of making the

03:11:02.900 --> 03:11:12.260
pseudo NES version of Left 4 Dead, but, you know, it's a PC game. Pixel Force also did that too.

03:11:12.260 --> 03:11:19.060
DJ Hero. Now they have an 8-bit DJ Hero game you can check out. It's got a bunch of cool chiptune

03:11:19.060 --> 03:11:26.660
mashups, including the, this is kind of cool, the Ghostbusters theme and Huey Lewis and the

03:11:26.660 --> 03:11:34.580
newest I Want a New Drug mix together. I can hear that. Apparently they said that one, it got some

03:11:34.580 --> 03:11:40.100
of the background or whatever was sampled from the same song or something, but lots of cool stuff,

03:11:40.100 --> 03:11:47.540
and you can check it out for free, and let's see where you can download that. Oh, ericruthgames.com.

03:11:47.540 --> 03:11:58.900
So that's pretty cool. And then, what else here? The Xbox Live Rewards program, something that just

03:11:58.900 --> 03:12:04.020
launched, so if you're a gold member or whatever, I don't even think you need to be a gold member,

03:12:04.580 --> 03:12:12.020
but you get some kickback Microsoft points for different things that you do. For example,

03:12:12.020 --> 03:12:19.860
renewing a one month gold membership will give you 10 Microsoft points back. Three months, 30,

03:12:19.860 --> 03:12:26.420
and 12 months, 200. Purchase or renew an Xbox Live Gold Family Pack, that gives you 400.

03:12:28.100 --> 03:12:34.580
Purchase or renew the first Xbox Live online gold membership, 100. Make your first purchase

03:12:34.580 --> 03:12:42.340
on Xbox Live, another 100. Select content's gonna vary. If you activate and use Netflix on Xbox Live,

03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:49.620
you get 100, and they have surveys for 20 Microsoft points. So, neat. You can do surveys

03:12:49.620 --> 03:12:54.660
and get 20 Microsoft points? Yes. Interesting. It'd take a lot of surveys before you can actually

03:12:54.660 --> 03:12:58.740
buy something. That's true. Well, you could get Technokit and Adventure for four surveys.

03:12:58.740 --> 03:13:05.620
That is true. Alright. That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We're

03:13:05.620 --> 03:13:09.540
about on out of here. Hey, if you liked what you heard tonight, or even if you didn't, you really

03:13:09.540 --> 03:13:17.380
should still help us spread the word. Tell a couple of friends about our show. Go to our iTunes

03:13:17.380 --> 03:13:22.660
and leave a nice five star review, or just spread the word. Tell a friend or two about our program,

03:13:22.660 --> 03:13:28.820
because we don't have, you know, all the advertising dollars and so forth behind our show.

03:13:28.820 --> 03:13:34.820
So just tell a friend or two. That's all we ask. Dark Soccer, do you have any final thoughts for

03:13:34.820 --> 03:13:41.620
our listeners tonight? You look lovely. Oh my, thank you. Rather so lovely. My final thought is,

03:13:41.620 --> 03:13:52.180
thanks, but no thanks. Loki, your final thought? My final thought is, I'm tired. Alright. That's

03:13:52.180 --> 03:13:56.900
gonna do it. Have a great week everybody. We really appreciate you, especially those folks

03:13:56.900 --> 03:14:00.580
that tuned in live and stayed up through the whole thing. But even you podcasties,

03:14:00.580 --> 03:14:03.700
thanks for staying with us through the whole thing. We really appreciate it. Have a wonderful

03:14:03.700 --> 03:14:08.340
week guys. We'll see you next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio. You've been listening to
