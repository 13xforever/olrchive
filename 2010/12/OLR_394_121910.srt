[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:55,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be with you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:55,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo.

9
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:56,259
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

10
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:01,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing well and energized and electrified.

11
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:02,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Electrified.

12
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:06,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, you sound, I don't know, like you've just been to Xanadu or something.

13
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:06,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

14
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,033
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I saw Tron twice this week.

15
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:09,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wasn't Tron amazing?

16
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:10,896
I know.

17
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:12,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll get into that in a minute, though.

18
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to introduce, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:18,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi How are you doing, Loki?

20
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:43,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, fine You know, I remember a time when you really hated all things Apple And now it's funny, because at the start of the show I'm always having to tear you away from that new little eye touch you have Or you've had for a couple months now No, you see, I hate all things Mac, not Apple Oh, my bad Because Apple, too, was a pretty awesome computer back in the day It's true, it's what we all played Oregon Trail But I'm sorry, all those Mac computers are way too damn overpriced

21
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Making friends, and we're not even five minutes into the show.

22
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:50,442
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the three of us here in studio tonight.

23
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:54,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, no guests joining us, but it is our last show of the year, if you can believe it.

24
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:57,586
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to be here because of the holiday next week, sadly.

25
00:01:57,706 --> 00:02:02,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, but some of us are going out of town, so we're not going to be able to get everybody together to do the show next week.

26
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:04,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's our last show of 2010.

27
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:09,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So, don't worry guys, we'll be back, of course, in two weeks.

28
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:11,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have plenty of show to go to tonight.

29
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we always like to start things off with, how was your gaming week?

30
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:19,340
[SPEAKER_02]: But, can I just say, OMG Tron, like, wasn't it great?

31
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I know!

32
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:22,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you got to go see it, what, Tuesday?

33
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:23,443
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you swing that?

34
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:27,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Jessica Harper had an extra ticket.

35
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she was on the show a few weeks ago, right?

36
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:31,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and she let me have it.

37
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:33,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we all went.

38
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:34,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

39
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:35,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And what'd you think?

40
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:37,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Oomph.

41
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:39,556
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the best part?

42
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:47,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, without spoiling, because keep in mind there's a lot of people that are like, OMG, you don't want spoilers, so is there a way you can kind of say the best part of the new Tron movie without ruining anything?

43
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:50,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

44
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I like how everything flowed together.

45
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:56,651
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'd have to say that I have a favorite line.

46
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:57,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

47
00:02:57,673 --> 00:02:59,435
[SPEAKER_07]: As we've discussed earlier, but I'll go ahead and repeat it.

48
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:02,479
[SPEAKER_07]: The cycles haven't been good, have they?

49
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,680
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't look that bad.

50
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:06,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice, very nice.

51
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:08,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you got to see the Trons as well.

52
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:09,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

53
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:10,544
[SPEAKER_02]: How was Tron for you?

54
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:11,664
[SPEAKER_10]: It was awesome.

55
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:13,625
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just everything I was hoping it would be.

56
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,366
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would definitely see it again.

57
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:18,987
[SPEAKER_10]: And everybody here saw it in 3D, right?

58
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:19,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

59
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:28,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, this is a movie that it is totally beneficial to see it in 3D because I'll just say Wizard of Oz Treatment.

60
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's not all in 3D, but it's very interesting.

61
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:39,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I would just say my favorite part was how they upgraded some things from the old movie.

62
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,732
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I say this without spoiling too much?

63
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:45,356
[SPEAKER_02]: But okay, y'all know there's going to be a light cycle sequence in it, right?

64
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:54,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they did the whole light cycles, but some of the new stuff they did with it, like I'm doing hand motions here in studio, I was just like, oh, that is so cool.

65
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:57,111
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so fucking badass.

66
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I'm trying to be good.

67
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:04,207
[SPEAKER_07]: If you actually go look on the Tron Wiki, they do explain that they're all different models.

68
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:07,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the interesting though, just kind of tie it back to what we're all about here at OLR.

69
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:10,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me want to play the game like really bad.

70
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game has not been kindly treated by the critics out there.

71
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:19,748
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been getting like average reviews.

72
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:23,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say average, I mean like a six, which I don't know.

73
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:26,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually when a game gets a six, that means it's really bad.

74
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:31,196
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie is only getting like a 40% or something on Rotten Tomatoes.

75
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:32,477
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a movie for critics.

76
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:34,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to win Oscars.

77
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:37,580
[SPEAKER_02]: The dialogue and story are all nerd service.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,061
[SPEAKER_02]: But I honestly think like I walked out of that theater.

79
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:41,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like mind blown.

80
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:48,426
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a movie worthy of like Star Wars, Star Trek, nerd opus, you know.

81
00:04:49,100 --> 00:05:04,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of that, if you have seen the first movie several times and know it very well, and if you've kept up with some of the roundabout stuff, even some of the old deleted scenes, there is a lot in this that makes sense.

82
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:12,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I actually went back and was listening to the soundtrack a bit, because keep in mind, I have the original soundtrack for the original Tron.

83
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:13,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but the new soundtrack also.

84
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:23,248
[SPEAKER_07]: When I went back and gave it a solid listen, some of the elements, especially for character theme songs, were incorporated from the original into the new.

85
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:27,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to say Daft Punk did an astounding job.

86
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize when people listen to the soundtrack the first time, they're like, this isn't like a Daft

87
00:05:33,372 --> 00:05:34,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not meant to be

88
00:05:49,477 --> 00:06:14,340
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not being a fanboy it would be a crime if Daft Punk didn't get nominated for the score because it adds that much to the movie like we don't need some artsy fartsy film stealing one of the nominations for score you know that's kind of like the same old same old that you always hear in a period piece this is something like really new and different I really hope it gets acknowledged I'm gonna spoil one thing there's nothing after the credits oh yeah okay that's not much of a spoiler

89
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:19,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but you know what else I really like too is how they gave the Disney castle the Tron treatment.

90
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:20,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's awesome.

91
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,671
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so cool.

92
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:25,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to go see the Disney electronica thing, which I still haven't seen.

93
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends there right now.

94
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:29,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We were supposed to go this weekend, but it just didn't work out, unfortunately.

95
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:30,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm glad we didn't.

96
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:30,998
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

97
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It rained the whole damn weekend.

98
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,020
[SPEAKER_07]: It got rained.

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,221
[SPEAKER_07]: They shut most of it down.

100
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:37,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I had friends that went down there.

101
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:39,026
[SPEAKER_02]: They still had a good time.

102
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:39,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to hear it.

103
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bummed I didn't go.

104
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:43,792
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I had a great time at the movie.

105
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:45,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Just awesome time.

106
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:46,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and saw it at the Metreon.

107
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:49,445
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

108
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:16,925
[SPEAKER_02]: They think that's what it was and I walked by.

109
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:26,428
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still an arcade in the movie theater and there was an arcade upstairs, the Tilt Arcade, which is right by the Walk of Game, which is still there.

110
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they've updated it in a while, but it's still there.

111
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:35,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sad because they're selling all these arcade machines, but seriously, some awesome deals.

112
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,911
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Marvel vs. Capcom machine for $300 on sale right now.

113
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,893
[SPEAKER_02]: A Beatmania 5th Mix, which is like the old school Beatmania.

114
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:43,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't tell anybody because I'm going to buy it.

115
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:44,813
[SPEAKER_02]: for $5,000.

116
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:47,075
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a total rip-off.

117
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:48,617
[SPEAKER_10]: That is ridiculous.

118
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,618
[SPEAKER_10]: That is ridiculous.

119
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:51,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lying.

120
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:51,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally lying.

121
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:54,181
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really this much.

122
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:55,463
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

123
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:58,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Jamie wants it, so I'm not allowed to tell the listeners.

124
00:07:58,705 --> 00:07:59,566
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not.

125
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:02,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's that.

126
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this was the funniest thing of all, though.

127
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:24,461
[SPEAKER_02]: going to the little claw or what not the claw machine you ever seen the ticket redemption machine where the light kind of goes around the marquee and you have to hit the stop button at a certain time and if you hit a stop button then you win a prize okay i posted this to my twitter do you know what one of the prizes was in there still in a sealed box a game boy advance e-reader machine with cards

128
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I lolled so hard seeing that.

129
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:58,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody, after going to see the movie that I went and saw it with yesterday, went online and started reading about Tron and who the actors were in the movie and how it tied into the 80s version.

130
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that nerd-tastic.

131
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

132
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:04,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual video games outside of Tron.

133
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:09,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm playing World of Warcraft.

134
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:10,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Addict.

135
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,660
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not.

136
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:17,485
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not because I'm still playing Star Trek Online and you can call me an addict for that.

137
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:18,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Double addict.

138
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:20,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not addicted.

139
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,157
[SPEAKER_07]: But I said I'd give it a chance.

140
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:29,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, I was seriously this close, again, to just going, forget it!

141
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:33,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, by this close, I mean like holding my fingers, you know, a half an inch apart.

142
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:36,505
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, stupid goat people, world sucks!

143
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:38,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I like playing goat people.

144
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:44,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm leveling faster, so I don't know what's up with that.

145
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:48,848
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's cool chatting with everyone in the guild and everything.

146
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,588
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty fun.

147
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It still seems more of the same to me.

148
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,609
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm giving it a chance.

149
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:56,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm somewhere new.

150
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:57,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing.

151
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob gave me some stuff.

152
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you lots of stuff.

153
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:03,771
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to play for a good month now.

154
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Well... And it still looks the same, too.

155
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I didn't make it there last time I played.

156
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:29,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's the name of the stupid... Darnassus.

157
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:30,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Darnassus.

158
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:32,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it still looks like Night Elf stuff.

159
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:33,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

160
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And Darnassus wasn't touched by Deathwing, too.

161
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:37,847
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to... He didn't take a big poop on it?

162
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:38,287
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't.

163
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:47,471
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you take the boat to the ruins of Albertine, which used to be Albertine, you'll start to see some of the damage and some of the better stuff, I think.

164
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:52,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured that I'm going to do that when I get, like, 20 and I'm, like, what, 14 now and I've been playing three days?

165
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:52,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

166
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:53,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah you've been doing very well

167
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:59,718
[SPEAKER_07]: 2 weeks to get to 20 last time.

168
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:06,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm gonna keep going with it.

169
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:07,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'll try.

170
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:13,430
[SPEAKER_07]: But like I said, you know, it's not something that I can keep doing consistently.

171
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:16,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm keeping my attachment to Star Trek Online.

172
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:20,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, by the way, Episode 3 of Star Trek Online came out.

173
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:22,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

174
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:33,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Once Cataclysm settles down a little bit, I still want to go back and check out Star Trek Online.

175
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:37,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully DC Universe isn't out by that point and derails everything.

176
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:43,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to go check it out a little bit, especially since they've changed so much since the beta that I originally had played.

177
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:53,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to try out the new stuff, but I'm not going to buy two boxes of upgrades unless I'm sure I'm going to play a little bit more.

178
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And even then, if I play, it's going to have to be in the form of month cards or something.

179
00:11:59,903 --> 00:12:04,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still ridiculous that they're charging so much for Wrath of the Lich King, and I think that will come down.

180
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:06,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of have to wait it out.

181
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:10,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably after the Christmas rush or something, it'll come down to try and woo new players into the game.

182
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's kind of what I'm hoping for.

183
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm not going to give up on it.

184
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:21,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like I said, if I keep playing it, it's going to be, well, I'll buy a month card to play.

185
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:27,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm not getting rid of my Star Trek Online subscription unless STO just starts getting ridiculously crappy.

186
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:37,210
[SPEAKER_07]: and right now though my frustration with Star Trek Online is that there's really not a whole lot of new stuff for new characters and I want new factions.

187
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:45,056
[SPEAKER_07]: They sort of teased that we're supposed to be getting Cardassian faction so I can keep up with the Cardassians.

188
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:47,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's a bad joke.

189
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:49,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not the first one to think of it either.

190
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play the Romulan stuff.

191
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,750
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing a lot of big stories for the Romulan factions.

192
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:03,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I really, really like what they're doing with the story because they're putting something in it for everybody.

193
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:04,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like...

194
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:06,938
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

195
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:27,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say, oh, and by the way, they did this in Star Trek Online and this, this, and it led to this story and this.

196
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:34,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, sounds like you're talking like, you know, well, she hasn't said right out, but I feel like I'm talking about an episode.

197
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:42,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they actually, when they bring everything up, it's like the way everything flows is like an episode of the show just without acting.

198
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:51,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good because just as someone who is a fan of the Star Trek series, not counting Enterprise, I really wish they would have another show.

199
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want there to be another TV show.

200
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:59,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that right now it's all about the movies and that new movie was awesome.

201
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:06,131
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would just love there to be a new show in the next-gen Voyager canon, Deep Space Nine canon, you know?

202
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:10,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like... Well, you know, and I've been going back and reading the books.

203
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:19,300
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the continuation books, which is really where... And this is going to be kind of a... I'm going to try not to veer too off the point.

204
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,143
[SPEAKER_07]: The book universe is very different than the game universe.

205
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,165
[SPEAKER_07]: The book universe is sort of like it's its own tangent.

206
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:36,450
[SPEAKER_07]: What I like about the game universe is that it incorporated the first movie by saying that this is what happened in the prime timeline.

207
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:40,592
[SPEAKER_07]: and the movie, as I said, is a new timeline.

208
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:45,833
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can keep going with all these characters that you love and, you know, history that you know.

209
00:14:46,914 --> 00:14:58,115
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd really like to see, you know, even them do like a comic series or new series, you know, involving the Star Trek Online universe or maybe the stuff that happened in between.

210
00:14:58,796 --> 00:14:59,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

211
00:14:59,336 --> 00:15:00,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything's possible.

212
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:01,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I love it.

213
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:06,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've incorporated some of the Enterprise stuff in there too, you know, even though I think it's kind of crappy.

214
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:07,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um...

215
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been very, very happy with Star Trek Online, but like I said, I'm giving World of Warcraft a try.

216
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I like my goat girl.

217
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,124
[SPEAKER_07]: She's dressed like a hoochie right now, but she can burn things.

218
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:26,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like, and I think this is new, the arcane missile thing.

219
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not new, but you... It's new for me.

220
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:44,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is at different levels now, so you might be getting it sooner than you would have before, because they rearranged everything when they did Cataclysm, and some people get talents at a really early level that they wouldn't have seen until level 40 before.

221
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:47,075
[SPEAKER_07]: This Arcane Missile thing, they're just like, here, have this for free.

222
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:48,255
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

223
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:50,557
[SPEAKER_07]: And you don't have to, it's just random.

224
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:52,838
[SPEAKER_07]: You can randomly cast it and it doesn't cost anything.

225
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,119
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's instant.

226
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can kill lots of stuff with it.

227
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking you specced for it somehow.

228
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:03,164
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of, yeah, usually those free things are usually some type of speccing.

229
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:05,126
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that's spending talent points.

230
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,126
[SPEAKER_02]: You spent your talent points.

231
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:07,967
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had it before I got my talent points.

232
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:08,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

233
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play a mage, so I have no idea how it works.

234
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:16,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll double check my stuff real quick because it's not going to show anything.

235
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:20,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I did pick Arcane Path, but I had everything before that.

236
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:22,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important.

237
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:25,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to veer off the path too much.

238
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I lost my pet, I don't know how to get it.

239
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:33,723
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think it's important for WoW veterans to hear how newbies approach WoW.

240
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:38,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think sometimes the WoW veterans just assume people come into WoW and they know everything.

241
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:39,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard.

242
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot to the game.

243
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:48,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important that if you're a veteran of WoW, you sometimes kind of hear what the new people are really thinking and some of the challenges and so forth.

244
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:50,958
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

245
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me look at chat room really quick because we want to get some questions out.

246
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:20,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

247
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:22,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick question from Breakman.

248
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:24,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the Star Trek cartoons canon?

249
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:26,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

250
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the animated series is considered canon.

251
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,670
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

252
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Breakman is also asking, do newbies still have to go find that wife in the Barrens?

253
00:17:34,535 --> 00:17:35,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

254
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:37,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play Horde, so I'm not sure.

255
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:40,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Still have to get the stupid mushrooms.

256
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Hate the mushrooms.

257
00:17:43,238 --> 00:17:52,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Due to the shift of Burning Crusade, or I'm sorry, due to the shift of Southern Barrens being its own zone now, I don't believe that quest is there anymore.

258
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:55,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid, stupid mushrooms.

259
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:57,103
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, that hasn't changed, but you'll get there.

260
00:17:57,163 --> 00:18:00,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then someone had to start in Badger, Badger, Rob.

261
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,425
[SPEAKER_07]: That was already in my head.

262
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:03,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

263
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:04,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, is there any games you've been playing?

264
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:07,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you don't play any MMOs right now, so what have you been up to?

265
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:13,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been just playing Grand Theft Auto and Sword and Poker 2.

266
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Playing lots of Sword and Poker 2.

267
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:25,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and I did actually play a little bit of... Now, it's a little confusing because I have both Tron games.

268
00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:29,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the Tron Legacy game and then also the Tron game.

269
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:30,600
[SPEAKER_10]: But I played Tron Legacy a little bit.

270
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:33,062
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's alright.

271
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:39,186
[SPEAKER_10]: You race around in light cycles and the recognizers.

272
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:39,486
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

273
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:45,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't like tilt steering.

274
00:18:46,414 --> 00:18:48,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate tilt steering in everything.

275
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:51,681
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, it's not, it doesn't feel natural.

276
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:54,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So you must be playing it on PS3 with the six axis or what?

277
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:55,867
[SPEAKER_10]: No, on the iPod.

278
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:57,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

279
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:59,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought these were the retail games.

280
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:01,530
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no.

281
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,994
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just tilt steering on the iPod to steer the bike.

282
00:19:06,254 --> 00:19:07,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate that.

283
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:08,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, got it.

284
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:11,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I prefer my finger.

285
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:15,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.

286
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:17,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't play a whole lot.

287
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,227
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too busy yelling at Comcast.

288
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the internet's been down for still, right?

289
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,050
[SPEAKER_02]: You were down last week and you're still down, right?

290
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,431
[SPEAKER_10]: They're dumb, okay?

291
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:29,493
[SPEAKER_10]: They're dumb.

292
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:45,102
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just put it that way and no, Comcast really doesn't care despite the fact, you know, what certain Twitter people will say and how they may seem concerned and ask you to email them and then they don't give a shit once you've emailed them, so.

293
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:45,762
[SPEAKER_02]: You mad?

294
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:46,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

295
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:48,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Just slightly.

296
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:54,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be canceling TV with them, actually, because I'm pretty pissed off.

297
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:59,391
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not working all the way, too, because I can't use any of the on-demand stuff, because the signal's not strong enough.

298
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:00,432
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

299
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:01,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to hear it.

300
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:07,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Thankfully, thank you to my new Virgin mobile phone, though, that I have rooted.

301
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:14,841
[SPEAKER_10]: I can now tie into the Wi-Fi on that to connect to 3G networks, so that has been a lifesaver, I tell you.

302
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:15,722
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

303
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:33,623
[SPEAKER_02]: my gaming week has been mostly dominated with World of Warcraft Cataclysm I won't kind of go all the way back into it but I hit level 85 which is the new max level this week so shut so that's and I've been just trying to gear for heroics and I am geared for heroics now so I'll be doing that soon

304
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:36,785
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as other games go, not anything new.

305
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:44,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some of the same old standbys like Rock Band 3, Super Meat Boy, and some of those games I've just been playing gradually over the past month.

306
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:45,807
[SPEAKER_02]: But not a whole lot.

307
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,789
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with the holidays coming up and everything, my gaming time has been kind of thin.

308
00:20:49,829 --> 00:21:01,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good news is, with the huge break coming up, I don't know about some of you out there, but I have been given at work, basically, the entire time between Christmas and New Year's off.

309
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:27,786
[SPEAKER_02]: our company does this whole like closure thing where we have to take time off basically which is you know I'm not gonna lie I kind of welcome it so it's gonna be a nice break but I don't know what to do with myself for like nine days off in a row I can't really afford to take any major trips right now so uh I guess I'll sit at home and play some games so that's good though because I really need to just catch up on some things so hopefully I'll get some gift cards for Christmas or something and go buy myself a couple new games and beat them that'd be great

310
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:31,393
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkCircuitry Internet equals Warcraft equals Rob's life at least

311
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:53,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Not totally.

312
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:55,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I spend a lot of my free time playing Warcraft.

313
00:21:55,696 --> 00:21:58,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's not forget, it just had a major expansion.

314
00:21:58,736 --> 00:22:01,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Its third expansion just came out like last week.

315
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:03,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, you know, that's kind of the focus right now.

316
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:07,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that'll die down once I've really experienced a lot of the new stuff.

317
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really plan on rolling in alts or, you know, getting through all that and all that.

318
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll have time to play a new game.

319
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I know how to go outdoors.

320
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the city all weekend.

321
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,021
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do more than just sit on the computer and play WoW.

322
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,001
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is a lot of what I do.

323
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:21,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

324
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:23,435
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

325
00:22:47,846 --> 00:23:11,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing in my netbook there you go stay connected and yeah I will just you know Loki and I will just be taking some time off for the holidays so we won't be here but we will be back the week after in the new year with a new show otherwise if you want to follow us on Twitter for all the updates about our show twitter.com slash OLR also be taking your Twitter topics there facebook.com slash orange lounge radio as well

326
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:19,216
[SPEAKER_02]: More comments from our chat room, chat.orangelongestradio.com Tigerclaw says, Sky will just play Cataclypse for nine days.

327
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:21,117
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not going to play for nine days straight.

328
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:22,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie.

329
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:24,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play a lot with the time off.

330
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to play the whole time.

331
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

332
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, I have Knights of the Clicky on Facebook I've got to be playing too.

333
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:33,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone sent me an invite to that.

334
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:33,763
[SPEAKER_10]: No thanks.

335
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:35,784
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real time waster.

336
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:40,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim Sally in our chatroom says, if you're bored next week, Rob, do a show every day.

337
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,972
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three hours taken care of.

338
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:44,373
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of fun.

339
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:45,855
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

340
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:48,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'd run out of things to talk about and then it would get kind of scary.

341
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Would the listeners help me do a show?

342
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:53,764
[SPEAKER_10]: You can talk about all the stuff coming out.

343
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:56,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, no, no.

344
00:23:57,368 --> 00:24:04,035
[SPEAKER_02]: There's already a bunch of live shows at All Games Radio where we do our show, and obviously we wouldn't want to bump any of those shows.

345
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:04,976
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the right to.

346
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:07,579
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of fine shows on the network, so...

347
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:11,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them do their thing and we'll see.

348
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:18,586
[SPEAKER_02]: William Murderface in our chatroom says, I love that name by the way, Rob, you need a drunken Rocky marathon.

349
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:20,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

350
00:24:21,468 --> 00:24:23,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing Rocky for so long now.

351
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I need to marathon it.

352
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:25,609
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

353
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And JV Mon in our chatroom says, Oh yeah, more people need to play Pinball FX2.

354
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.

355
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball FX2 is great.

356
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:35,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.orangeloungeradio.com

357
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to some gaming news.

358
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:42,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, there is still some going on this week, even though it is the holiday period.

359
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:42,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

360
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:43,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

361
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:49,388
[SPEAKER_10]: So apparently Microsoft is wanting, obviously, to improve upon what they've already created.

362
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:52,288
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to quadruple the Kinect's accuracy.

363
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:58,830
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way they're going to do that is by unrestricting the camera from the 320x240 pixel resolution range

364
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:24,885
[SPEAKER_10]: to unlock it to 640x480 and unfortunately they can't do that right now because of the limitations put on by the console's USB controller interface which has to keep open enough to support other USB based peripherals like batteries and rechargers but if they somehow enable it to where you know they

365
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:27,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

366
00:25:48,268 --> 00:26:18,000
[SPEAKER_10]: so that's kind of cool and they said that can all be accomplished with a firmware update so um that is kind of cool and kind of makes you wonder why it wasn't there in the first place well they said right there it's because of the limitations of the console because right now they have to you know they have to play nice with all the other peripherals on there um I don't under well I mean I guess the USB controller so I was gonna say I don't understand why they couldn't just unrestrict the one port for the Kinect but um I don't know it would be difficult to do that uh

367
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:22,967
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as whatever they do doesn't impact the older consoles.

368
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:26,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's my fear is that, you know, as they keep talking about, we're going to upgrade all this stuff for firmware.

369
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:27,888
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do all these upgrades.

370
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:31,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but if you have the old white Xboxes, then you're fucked.

371
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,730
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only going to work with the 360s.

372
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,831
[SPEAKER_10]: You just need the adapter that comes with it, but...

373
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:39,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's just for power.

374
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:43,333
[SPEAKER_10]: They just have more power coming through there.

375
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:51,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess what they could do is say, when running the Kinect, you can only hook up one device or two devices or something like that.

376
00:26:52,217 --> 00:26:54,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's the way they could get around it.

377
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:56,018
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

378
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:02,481
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little tricky, but I could see them doing it, especially if it's going to make things that much better.

379
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:06,283
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time...

380
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:12,627
[SPEAKER_10]: We really need the games to be four times better anyways.

381
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:24,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not convinced that even if you make the technology better that there's enough games with really new ideas there yet to substantiate it, if that makes sense.

382
00:27:24,596 --> 00:27:34,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Central is awesome, but as far as a lot of those other adventures and those sorts of games go, the fitness games, I'm kind of over it.

383
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:34,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me...

384
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:42,088
[SPEAKER_02]: How Kinect is going to make my life as a gamer even more awesomer.

385
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:43,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, that's a term, more awesomer.

386
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,730
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, show me how Kinect's going to do that.

387
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:51,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinect is still kind of a flashy...

388
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:58,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen it really truly integrated into the hardcore games that I'm used to.

389
00:27:59,331 --> 00:27:59,812
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

390
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:00,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know what you mean.

391
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:12,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So at one point I'm kind of like, don't waste your time with this upgrade to the technology unless you have the games to kind of back that up that aren't just more exercise games and more dance games.

392
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:20,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think they're just working on having that available for when they do get to that point as far as game development goes.

393
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:25,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, yeah, some of the stuff that is available right now, it's very basic with what they have you doing.

394
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:40,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Central is a pretty good example of what it can do, but some other games that kind of just have these modes tacked on, like Harry Potter and stuff, where it's just an on-rails thing that you... It's very unnecessary.

395
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:42,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't know.

396
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:50,632
[SPEAKER_10]: They need less fitness games, less snowboarding-esque games.

397
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:54,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some better ideas.

398
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:58,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

399
00:28:58,407 --> 00:29:01,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Dara Gage wants to give a cheap plug to connectable.net.

400
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:03,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Games are only scratching the surface.

401
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,390
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a good thought.

402
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at some of the stuff here that they have.

403
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:08,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, I've been kind of reading about the hacks on the Internet.

404
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:15,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And this website, connectable.net, seems to be kind of a collection of the different sorts of hacks that are out there, like lots of YouTubes.

405
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:20,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing things like an air piano where you can use your hand to play the piano.

406
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:21,239
[SPEAKER_02]: on Kinect.

407
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:28,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not exactly like a real piano, but still, it's an impressive little thing that they're doing with the technology.

408
00:29:28,564 --> 00:29:36,550
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta wonder if Microsoft's kind of letting this hack thing go a little bit just to see what people are coming up with so they can steal it.

409
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,250
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I want?

410
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:38,611
[SPEAKER_07]: The Kinect's theremin.

411
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,254
[SPEAKER_07]: This is me being serious.

412
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:43,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I really want a theremin.

413
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:45,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Kinect music.

414
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:45,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

415
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:48,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Since there was Wii music, let's have Kinect music.

416
00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:49,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually have it be good?

417
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

418
00:29:51,231 --> 00:30:05,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's not, because once again we figured out that porting stuff over from the Wii or basically copying the ideas that you've done on the Wii is not exactly a great plan, because then a lot of these games just come out very cheesy.

419
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:11,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, even some of the games are just... I mean, like DECA Sports and Game Party.

420
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:12,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's just...

421
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:14,782
[SPEAKER_10]: That's stuff that they have on the Wii right now.

422
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:20,944
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need a ton of minigame collections and little sports compilations and stuff like that.

423
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:24,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Just come up with something cool.

424
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:33,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And something that doesn't even necessarily need to use your whole body, like head tracking in a first-person shooter would be pretty awesome.

425
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:35,649
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be actually really awesome.

426
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:37,669
[SPEAKER_10]: It's completely optional.

427
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:39,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to duck, you have to duck.

428
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,191
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can like do that on your couch.

429
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:41,792
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not even.

430
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:42,472
[SPEAKER_10]: That's dumb.

431
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:43,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

432
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:44,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Not even the ducking thing.

433
00:30:44,654 --> 00:30:49,417
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm saying like you can poke your head a little bit to the side to kind of get a different perspective.

434
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:51,078
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a little bit more immersive.

435
00:30:51,358 --> 00:30:53,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't take that much technology.

436
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you imagine time crisis done with head tracking?

437
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,953
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be cool, but I'm kind of sick of time crisis.

438
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:11,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm just saying, I'm taking that concept to where, you know, say that you duck under, you know, a divider and you can peek over it and that type of thing.

439
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,324
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just trying to think of a solution for, like, you know, people that want to play with controllers on a, you know, on a couch or something like that.

440
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:21,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And they can make everything very minimal and optional.

441
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:23,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you don't have to have...

442
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:25,249
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

443
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:50,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting comment because, yeah, Police 911 used a dance games technology.

444
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically Para Para Paradise, the setup, to kind of do this different sort of game.

445
00:31:55,474 --> 00:31:57,175
[SPEAKER_07]: All the, like, mo-cap boxing and all that.

446
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:58,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the whole mo-cap thing.

447
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:03,740
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the same theory, but I'm saying that now with the Kinect, something like that is actually really possible.

448
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, just like, you know, Para Para is possible in the home.

449
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:08,784
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that Dance Masters game.

450
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:09,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I need to get.

451
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:10,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

452
00:32:10,726 --> 00:32:14,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I forgot to mention that for my thing, but I got a Kinect for Decemberween.

453
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:15,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats.

454
00:32:15,829 --> 00:32:16,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

455
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:17,723
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

456
00:32:17,883 --> 00:32:18,544
[SPEAKER_02]: For Festivus?

457
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:19,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Decemberween.

458
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:20,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you call it?

459
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:21,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to call it Decemberween.

460
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:22,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Decemberween.

461
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:23,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

462
00:32:24,547 --> 00:32:24,787
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

463
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:28,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to lend your own comments.

464
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:31,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of comments there just kind of on that story.

465
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:31,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

466
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:34,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's go back to talking about WoW for a minute.

467
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:37,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys, but I know some of you are WoW haters, and that's fine.

468
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:39,955
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to like what they like, but you can't ignore this.

469
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:45,157
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft shatters a record this week yet again, and probably to no one's surprise.

470
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:46,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Cataclysm is sold...

471
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:47,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

472
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:07,291
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

473
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:22,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

474
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering, well, has Cataclysm launched in every country?

475
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:44,083
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly there's a gap there.

476
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:46,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's only day one, I think, too.

477
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:52,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, some people, you know, couldn't make it over the day or waited a little bit or they're getting as a gift.

478
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:57,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some people are honestly having to wait like a month because, you know, the economy the way it is.

479
00:33:57,153 --> 00:34:04,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's certain people in my guild that are like, I'm not going to be doing Cataclysm until the new year at least because just can't afford it.

480
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:04,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much.

481
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:07,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think there's a lot of people that just...

482
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:10,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is Cataclysm like a lot of that stuff like Endgame?

483
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:14,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I could see maybe some people starting off there saying, eh, I don't need it.

484
00:34:14,943 --> 00:34:24,206
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is because the stuff that affected the pre-Endgame, you know, the 0-60 experience, you don't need this expansion to experience any of that.

485
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:30,007
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all a free upgrade basically because they destroyed the old world and ushered in this new one.

486
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:31,588
[SPEAKER_02]: However...

487
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:42,198
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole Worgen and Goblin experience, which are really well done starting areas, just as far as immersing in story and everything, you can't do unless you have Cataclysm.

488
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:43,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't do those new races.

489
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:55,911
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can still roll a Draenei like DarkSakura is and at level 15 or whatever, head over to the other continent and experience some of the Cataclysm stuff without really needing the Cataclysm expansion.

490
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:56,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

491
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:58,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting.

492
00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:05,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Other important news out of Blizzard, and this isn't about WoW, but this could be about what ends up killing WoW.

493
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:06,075
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

494
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Blizzard might actually be making the game that is going to kill WoW.

495
00:35:09,457 --> 00:35:10,697
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making their own WoW killer.

496
00:35:11,537 --> 00:35:21,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank Pierce, in an interview with Destructoid, confirmed that the earlier rumor was true that the next MMO that they are making is called Titan.

497
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:23,822
[SPEAKER_02]: At least right now, that's a code name.

498
00:35:24,062 --> 00:35:24,522
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

499
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:57,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, take a lot of that with a grain of salt.

500
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, more quote here in the interview with Destructoid, quote, The media is not supposed to know anything about Titan.

501
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,872
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our next-gen MMO, and we've only started... Excuse me.

502
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

503
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:38,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I'm kind of curious as to what this is, but they probably won't even do an announcement until like BlizzCon 2012 or something.

504
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:39,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a ways out there, guys.

505
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:49,778
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting to know that that part of the rumor was true, because I think I passed it off on Horde House's fan wank, so sometimes I can be wrong about things.

506
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,600
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

507
00:36:52,406 --> 00:37:01,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Pac-Man Fever nah you remember that song don't you yes I do of course I remember that song well so do the folks that song's older than most of our listeners you know

508
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so the folks at Rock Band, they remember it.

509
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:07,520
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, it came out the same year as Tron.

510
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

511
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Pac-Man Fever album will be on Rock Band Download Content.

512
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:16,462
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's supposed to be early 2001.

513
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:23,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will have, as I said, Pac-Man Fever and Do the Donkey Kong and Froggy's Lament.

514
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:27,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you guys know, these songs were actually kind of terrible.

515
00:37:28,285 --> 00:37:29,525
[SPEAKER_07]: But pull up Pac-Man Fever.

516
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:29,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

517
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

518
00:37:39,063 --> 00:37:41,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know.

519
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:44,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was popular when it came out.

520
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:48,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember skating at the roller rink to this song.

521
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:50,953
[SPEAKER_02]: So do I. I'm totally dating myself, but...

522
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,266
[SPEAKER_02]: This song was really just written.

523
00:37:58,286 --> 00:38:00,989
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole album was just little video game tie-in songs.

524
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:03,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really just written to cash in on the whole craze.

525
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,813
[SPEAKER_02]: One-hit wonder band.

526
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:07,756
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want me to find the 7-Up commercial.

527
00:38:08,237 --> 00:38:09,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I've shown you the 7-Up commercial.

528
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:12,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yes, a long time ago on this show, yes.

529
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:14,484
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's coming out.

530
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd get it.

531
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:18,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't mind having some Pac-Man fever.

532
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:20,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Skullcrusher Mountain Skullcrusher Mountain So there you go

533
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:48,109
[SPEAKER_10]: The other songs on the album sound kind of funny.

534
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:49,710
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't really heard any of those other ones.

535
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,472
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been ages since I've listened to any of the other ones.

536
00:38:52,552 --> 00:38:55,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually did have that on vinyl back in the day.

537
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:56,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

538
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:58,696
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a collector's album.

539
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:01,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, let me pull it up here so you can hear a little bit here.

540
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a little bit of Do the Donkey Kong if you want to know what this song's about.

541
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Pac-Man fever Alright, there you go

542
00:39:31,947 --> 00:39:48,358
[SPEAKER_10]: So when the whole ESPN streaming was announced for, or actually I'd say when it came out as part of the November dashboard update for the Xbox 360, some people unfortunately were unable to participate in that streaming.

543
00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:54,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And those would be folks that had Bright House, which is owned by Time Warner.

544
00:39:57,004 --> 00:39:58,306
[SPEAKER_10]: as their cable provider.

545
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:05,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, those people were unable to actually get the ESPN app to work correctly.

546
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,416
[SPEAKER_10]: But now it says, apparently...

547
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:18,463
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is coming from the ESPN website.

548
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:26,690
[SPEAKER_10]: The way it works, I guess, is when a Time Warner or Bright House user turns on their Xbox 360 and tries to access the ESPN app...

549
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:51,097
[SPEAKER_10]: it'll direct them to the ESPN activation page where they have to authenticate their account with Bright House or Time Warner then it'll be given an access code once you have that you would I guess you're going to be able to actually use the streaming service now so that's kind of neat that they're not locked out of it anymore I guess some money exchanged hands or something like that

550
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:53,398
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

551
00:41:17,896 --> 00:41:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought it was kind of weird that the whole Comcast logo was in the corner.

552
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:22,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it knows.

553
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:24,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's aware.

554
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:31,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know it's just reading my IP and so it can tell and probably the gateway I'm going through and what have you, but it always kind of struck me as interesting.

555
00:41:32,043 --> 00:41:32,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

556
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:36,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I want to open this can of worms and make me sound even more ignorant, but whatever.

557
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:38,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to ask this question.

558
00:41:38,946 --> 00:42:03,526
[SPEAKER_02]: is the reason how Time Warner and all these companies are able to block this because of the fact that net neutrality didn't actually work out or was like they they found that it's not in the courts or whatever that it's not actually exists that that neutrality shouldn't exist because part of me says well how can Time Warner block this when it's on the internet

559
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:18,905
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like how they go in the squabbles with Fox or whatever will be all of a sudden blacked out on a certain cable provider because they don't want to pay certain royalties or whatever.

560
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:26,307
[SPEAKER_10]: So it may have been that these, like Time Warner Bright House, didn't want to pay ESPN or whatever or...

561
00:42:27,931 --> 00:42:29,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Something to that effect, I'm thinking.

562
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right, but that's also not the internet.

563
00:42:31,876 --> 00:42:33,097
[SPEAKER_02]: That's TV.

564
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,099
[SPEAKER_02]: So it always kind of fascinated me.

565
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,261
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's TV content.

566
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:40,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how that exactly works with streaming on the web and stuff like that.

567
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:43,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you can get to it... Because I know some places you can't...

568
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:52,998
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't stream certain games on the web depending on your location or something like that because of blackouts.

569
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:57,859
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a Time Warner user, would you be able to get around this just by spoofing your IP?

570
00:42:59,299 --> 00:42:59,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

571
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:00,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.

572
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet there's websites out of there with more devious information than things I've read.

573
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:06,221
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

574
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:11,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not really going to pay attention to this whole streaming app until they have ESPN8, the Ocho.

575
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:16,844
[SPEAKER_10]: with all sorts of extreme sports and Dodgeball.

576
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:18,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, actually, I did try to watch.

577
00:43:18,825 --> 00:43:20,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember when Dodgeball came out and stuff?

578
00:43:20,486 --> 00:43:24,189
[SPEAKER_10]: And then shortly after that, they actually did have Dodgeball on one of the ESPNs.

579
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:24,789
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

580
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:25,249
[SPEAKER_02]: They did.

581
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,451
[SPEAKER_10]: It was boring.

582
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:30,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Goes to show you, it's just a movie.

583
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:32,734
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not exciting in real life.

584
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:36,597
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's an awesome 8-bit NES video game, just so you know.

585
00:43:37,217 --> 00:43:37,597
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

586
00:43:37,817 --> 00:43:39,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And a Game Boy Advance launch title.

587
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:56,646
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like if someone, you know, if for whatever reason they decide, hey, you know what, it'd be awesome if we have some people running around an arena throwing frisbees with little lights on the outside of them and playing tag, you know, kind of like Tron, but, you know, Disc Wars and stuff like that.

588
00:43:57,047 --> 00:43:59,908
[SPEAKER_10]: That would not be fun to watch more than once.

589
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:06,095
[SPEAKER_02]: JV Mon in our chatroom asks, but Sky, why would you go out of your way to do that for ESPN?

590
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:10,079
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're that into ESPN, you probably already have all their channels.

591
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:17,365
[SPEAKER_02]: True, but I'm going by that hacker mentality of because I can, and I'm not going to be told no.

592
00:44:18,186 --> 00:44:22,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, isn't that kind of why people install Linux on toasters?

593
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:24,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they can, you know?

594
00:44:25,272 --> 00:44:27,594
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't is not a suitable answer.

595
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:30,757
[SPEAKER_10]: I consider that as I'm a power user.

596
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:40,870
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, if I want Linux to be on my toast, then that would be kind of cool to put Linux on a toaster and then have it print stuff on your toast.

597
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:42,592
[SPEAKER_10]: If that were possible.

598
00:44:42,653 --> 00:44:43,674
[SPEAKER_07]: They make a coffee printer.

599
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:49,323
[SPEAKER_10]: ESPN3 is a paid service that the ISP has to buy, so spoofing your IP won't matter because the content can't get through the Time Warner routers.

600
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks!

601
00:45:17,422 --> 00:45:24,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Rama in our chatroom says, Sky getting into ESPN, he loses 20 gay points.

602
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:25,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

603
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:28,071
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of gay guys that are into sports.

604
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:36,737
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, one of my best friends I'm taking to this game with me because he likes sports a lot and he likes basketballs and he happens to be too gay.

605
00:45:36,757 --> 00:45:37,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

606
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:39,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's move on.

607
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,221
[SPEAKER_02]: More news going on.

608
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:45,072
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation app on the iPhone.

609
00:45:45,553 --> 00:45:47,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Not here yet, but here's the deal.

610
00:45:48,153 --> 00:45:50,753
[SPEAKER_02]: A PlayStation app has been announced for phones.

611
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:56,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is releasing this, the official PlayStation app in Europe.

612
00:45:57,175 --> 00:46:01,595
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be doing some PlayStation Network interaction through your iPhone or Android device.

613
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:02,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me think.

614
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:07,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Could that be buying games and spending money and my points through the phone?

615
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:08,376
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to be one of it, right?

616
00:46:08,957 --> 00:46:11,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're not going to be playing games on this.

617
00:46:11,457 --> 00:46:12,538
[SPEAKER_02]: One would hope so.

618
00:46:36,815 --> 00:46:39,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Then again, we are sort of the red-headed stepchild of the world.

619
00:46:39,757 --> 00:46:54,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is interesting that with all these rumors we've had lately of the Sony phone and the photos of it in action and all that, that they are acknowledging at least that the iPhone still has a huge-ass market share, so they ought to put something official on it.

620
00:46:55,385 --> 00:47:03,449
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they need to stop wasting their time with this crap and actually deliver on the stuff that they promised way back in the day before all this stuff was coming out.

621
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:11,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, we would have trophy rooms in home where we can show off our trophies and they would be really cool interactive things and people could walk through and do that.

622
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:13,213
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still not there.

623
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:15,194
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell?

624
00:47:16,575 --> 00:47:17,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.

625
00:47:17,636 --> 00:47:20,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Do what you promised and stop wasting the damn time.

626
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's a little bitter.

627
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:23,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, a little bit.

628
00:47:23,801 --> 00:47:24,581
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not that it matters.

629
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:27,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I would never go in the home again anyways, because it's a waste of time.

630
00:47:28,322 --> 00:47:31,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bag on Apple for a little bit for a minute, though.

631
00:47:31,404 --> 00:47:32,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's why Game Center sucks.

632
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:38,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's so much trash out there in the App Store, especially stuff that is free.

633
00:47:38,906 --> 00:47:42,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I kid you not, I downloaded a free app the other day, and the game itself is alright.

634
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:47,870
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to unlock, here's how you get quote-unquote achievements in Game Center.

635
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:49,551
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

636
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:26,950
[SPEAKER_02]: there needs to be some type of quality control I feel like Microsoft's put a little bit more quality control in achievements granted there's some pretty asinine achievements out there too and some of them have to do with download content and things like that but I don't know I just look at Game Center and I go sometimes leaving this stuff wide open is a little too open but maybe that's just me

637
00:48:28,456 --> 00:48:57,232
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes I just go lolz going back to ESPN3 for a little bit because I find this conversation in our chat room humorous at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Derek H says oh my god I'm checking out ESPN3 right now World Badminton Championships enough said but I like Breakman's follow up they could have at least called it the shuttlecock tournament nice there you go chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat with these folks I know right

638
00:48:58,066 --> 00:48:59,729
[SPEAKER_05]: How about something that has nothing to do with cocks?

639
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Boring!

640
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:02,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, no, we can do it.

641
00:49:03,393 --> 00:49:10,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's been a call to ban Mafia 2 by the daughter of a Sicilian journalist who was murdered by the Mafia.

642
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:14,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the journalist was murdered, of course, not she was.

643
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Her name is Sonia Alfano.

644
00:49:16,322 --> 00:49:22,246
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a member of the European Parliament and president of Italy's Association for the Family of Mafia Victims.

645
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:26,869
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think she, basically, she's still grieving.

646
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:27,949
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it happened in 93.

647
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Her father, Beppe, was murdered in January 93.

648
00:49:34,173 --> 00:49:35,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

649
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:57,547
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, it's dealing with the American Mafia.

650
00:49:57,727 --> 00:50:00,750
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, sort of like the Godfather and Sopranos, that type of thing.

651
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:06,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And that they, you know, were trying to make it sort of a more realistic type thing, yet still be entertaining.

652
00:50:06,556 --> 00:50:11,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily to glorify the violence in real life things, but to take the sort of...

653
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:15,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Fictional world of it.

654
00:50:16,376 --> 00:50:20,319
[SPEAKER_07]: To take the fictional world of it, not necessarily glamorize it.

655
00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:24,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the funny thing.

656
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:27,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I think this is a little bit too much.

657
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:32,367
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't ban an entire video game just because something unfortunate happened.

658
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to disrespect what happened.

659
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:39,031
[SPEAKER_02]: That's terrible that she lost her father in a crime like that so many years ago.

660
00:50:39,251 --> 00:50:43,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine that's something that you never get over, even though it's like 17 years later.

661
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:48,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It's letting one bad apple ruin the barrel, so to speak.

662
00:50:48,698 --> 00:50:55,144
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, though, Take-Two's argument of, well, it's not the European mafia, it's the American mafia.

663
00:50:55,324 --> 00:51:04,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's... I don't think that's specifically their argument, just that they're saying that it's set, you know, the whole Godfather Sopranos slash kind of thing.

664
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:09,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I'm reminded of this completely random conversation I was having last night on the train.

665
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:25,647
[SPEAKER_02]: But Alan and I took Bart into the city to go to the Metreon to see Tron, right?

666
00:51:26,207 --> 00:51:31,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we were going down into the Bart Tunnel, I was commenting, wow, I have 3G signal in here.

667
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:34,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had 3G signal in Bart Tunnel, I don't remember when.

668
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:35,789
[SPEAKER_02]: They must have put a tower down here, right?

669
00:51:36,229 --> 00:51:42,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, yeah, I think they put a cell tower down in the Bart stations a couple years ago, you know, so people could still use their phone when they're down here.

670
00:51:43,832 --> 00:51:56,388
[SPEAKER_02]: but it met with a lot of resistance for a while they didn't want to put it in I was like oh is that just San Francisco being hippies again they don't want more cell towers no apparently it had to do with the fact that when the UK bombings happened back in oh...

671
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:09,098
[SPEAKER_02]: 405, sorry if I'm misstating that, but back when those happened, when those buses went off, that was all triggered via internet and Wi-Fi or what have you, wireless signals.

672
00:52:09,439 --> 00:52:13,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they didn't want something similar happening in the San Francisco BART tunnels.

673
00:52:13,382 --> 00:52:14,963
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said, well, wait a minute.

674
00:52:15,303 --> 00:52:16,344
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously...

675
00:52:16,824 --> 00:52:17,524
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not arguing.

676
00:52:17,564 --> 00:52:19,285
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just telling me the fact of the matter.

677
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:21,086
[SPEAKER_02]: But my response is, wait a minute.

678
00:52:22,107 --> 00:52:28,670
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody's going to do something stupid, they don't need 3G signal in order to be able to do it or not.

679
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is my thing too.

680
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:33,012
[SPEAKER_07]: My granddaddy died of cancer.

681
00:52:33,552 --> 00:52:34,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a problem with house.

682
00:52:37,174 --> 00:52:37,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Must be lupus.

683
00:52:38,703 --> 00:52:41,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that they also I've just picked something hospital related so

684
00:52:49,185 --> 00:52:54,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have problems with people that smoke other than that they usually stink.

685
00:52:56,088 --> 00:52:58,429
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's how my granddaddy got cancer.

686
00:52:59,569 --> 00:53:15,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the other thing I think this gal needs to take into consideration is that if she's upset about this mafia video game, is she upset at the movie that comes out once every three months at least that also glamorizes the mafia and the crime and all that stuff?

687
00:53:15,836 --> 00:53:17,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's an awful lot of movies...

688
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:18,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Books

689
00:53:21,476 --> 00:53:22,156
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of books.

690
00:53:22,297 --> 00:53:23,217
[SPEAKER_02]: The Godfather was a book.

691
00:53:23,237 --> 00:53:25,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I think she's sensitive.

692
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,120
[SPEAKER_05]: She has a right to be sensitive.

693
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:33,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand she's sensitive, but at the same time, you don't take that out on everybody else.

694
00:53:34,785 --> 00:53:41,129
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean you ban a game from an entire country because you have that whole response to it.

695
00:53:41,149 --> 00:53:48,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's people taking their personal... Honestly, this goes back to one of the biggest things that I think is wrong with the world in general.

696
00:53:48,674 --> 00:53:49,695
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes back to that...

697
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:53,849
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very selfish, I think.

698
00:53:54,629 --> 00:53:56,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not trying to belittle her grief.

699
00:53:57,431 --> 00:53:57,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

700
00:53:58,072 --> 00:54:03,236
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like, especially with the whole political correctness thing.

701
00:54:04,837 --> 00:54:11,402
[SPEAKER_07]: People spend so many time because one or two people are offended for something, but not the entire population.

702
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:12,803
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

703
00:54:14,134 --> 00:54:20,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orangeontradio.com, Frisbee says, Remember, 3G and Wi-Fi didn't cause those buses to explode.

704
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:21,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Explosives did.

705
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was kind of my point, too.

706
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Jvmon in our chatroom says, Does that mean Facebook will be taking off mafia wars?

707
00:54:29,502 --> 00:54:33,645
[SPEAKER_02]: William Murderface says, Is she mad at Jersey Shore for making Italians look like asses?

708
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:37,707
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole nother topic.

709
00:54:38,047 --> 00:54:42,371
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my thing, okay, for example, and I actually get a lot of this living in California.

710
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:44,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to pick something neutral and something light.

711
00:54:44,893 --> 00:54:49,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the whole, oh, Alabama's full of rednecks thing, which I know for a fact it's not.

712
00:54:50,117 --> 00:54:50,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm from there.

713
00:54:51,178 --> 00:54:51,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I a redneck?

714
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Rob, you do get awfully excited over Chick-fil-A.

715
00:54:57,523 --> 00:54:58,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Chick-fil-A's delicious.

716
00:54:58,925 --> 00:55:02,107
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I'm kidding, by the way.

717
00:55:02,668 --> 00:55:03,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the angry emails down.

718
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:04,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

719
00:55:04,674 --> 00:55:15,019
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, you know, a lot of people in the South are uber conservative, Bush loving, you know, gun-toting rednecks.

720
00:55:15,299 --> 00:55:18,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the stereotypes exist for a reason.

721
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:24,084
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I don't get offended because I know they're not talking about me.

722
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:30,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Now if they said all people from Alabama are freaking rednecks and all that, I'd be like, you know what?

723
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:32,108
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not true.

724
00:55:32,888 --> 00:55:33,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Allow me to educate you.

725
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:36,550
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

726
00:55:53,622 --> 00:56:06,534
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm saying that people, and I understand the concept behind wanting to make things better for other people, wanting to try to decrease opportunity for hate, if that makes sense, Rob?

727
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:13,080
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, I think that people are a little too sensitive.

728
00:56:13,965 --> 00:56:17,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like this comment and I think this is a good one to end it on and move on to another story.

729
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:24,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Breakman in our chat room says people have the right to their opinions but they don't have the right to enforce their opinions on others.

730
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:25,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.

731
00:56:26,437 --> 00:56:26,797
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

732
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:29,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the world just needs to be a little thicker skinned.

733
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:48,833
[SPEAKER_02]: chat.orangeloungeradio.com or you can always email us if you have an opinion on that mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com I'd actually be really curious about this and this might be a dangerous place to go but that's okay we'll be a little bit dangerous here on OLR I kind of want to know if there's a game out there that has ever made someone

734
00:56:50,434 --> 00:56:54,637
[SPEAKER_02]: that has ever kind of offended someone in this similar type of manner?

735
00:56:54,657 --> 00:57:03,463
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not necessarily like, I don't want to hear your really upsetting story about something that happened in the family or whatever, but has there ever been something in a video game where you were just kind of like, you know what?

736
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:05,065
[SPEAKER_02]: They really shouldn't have done that.

737
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:09,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of curious if people can think of a case like that and email it to us.

738
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:10,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com

739
00:57:23,842 --> 00:57:27,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying that now we should know what the warning signs are, know what to stop.

740
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:32,774
[SPEAKER_07]: There should be no legislation that forces one person.

741
00:57:33,455 --> 00:57:37,401
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something different when it's something that's beyond your control.

742
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:42,925
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, now that we can learn from history, I think that that's one thing.

743
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:46,627
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that people do need to understand that there's just assholes in the world.

744
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:49,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And people are, haters gonna hate, right?

745
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:50,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

746
00:57:50,749 --> 00:57:52,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my favorite saying in the world.

747
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:58,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Just gotta be a little bit better than them, but you know, ready to put the stop when it actually is something that you can do something about.

748
00:57:59,014 --> 00:58:00,595
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't change minds.

749
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:03,317
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't change the way people feel.

750
00:58:03,977 --> 00:58:05,458
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can change how you respond to it.

751
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:06,509
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

752
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:15,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a comment here along those lines from Derek H in our chat room says, I did not like the airport scene in Call of Duty 4 at all.

753
00:58:15,612 --> 00:58:17,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was really fucked up and had no reason being there.

754
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:20,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.orangeaudrey.com or our mailbag.

755
00:58:21,274 --> 00:58:26,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I was really offended when Rockstar Games decided, hey, you know what?

756
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:34,661
[SPEAKER_10]: For the Ballad of Gay Tony, we're going to make all the deathmatch multiplayer into smaller closed-knit locations.

757
00:58:34,741 --> 00:58:38,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead, the open-world Grand Theft Auto... Oops, dropped my iPod.

758
00:58:39,644 --> 00:58:46,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Closed-knit deathmatch locations, not the big old expansive open-world stuff.

759
00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:47,610
[SPEAKER_10]: That was very offensive to me.

760
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure we're on the same page, Loki.

761
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:54,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure you're quite seeing the same thing out of this topic.

762
00:58:54,554 --> 00:58:56,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

763
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:59,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more games are coming out, and I don't know if there's anything offensive.

764
00:58:59,658 --> 00:59:03,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the holiday week after all, but let's travel the world and see what releases are coming out.

765
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,481
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with the US.

766
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a whole lot coming out this week.

767
00:59:12,124 --> 00:59:13,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Mostly download stuff.

768
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:15,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I shouldn't say mostly.

769
00:59:16,106 --> 00:59:17,327
[SPEAKER_10]: All of it download stuff.

770
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:19,949
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're just going to talk about some download stuff instead.

771
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,251
[SPEAKER_10]: The normal console releases.

772
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:25,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Monday you're going to get Cosmo Fighters on DSiWare.

773
00:59:26,173 --> 00:59:36,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Darklight Dungeon on PC, FroBot on WiiWare, Mario Party 2 on Virtual Console, and Paul's Monster Adventure on DSiWare.

774
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:43,864
[SPEAKER_10]: December 21st, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam will be coming out on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

775
00:59:44,544 --> 00:59:56,577
[SPEAKER_10]: and then finally on December 22nd, A World of Keflins and this is awesome, Back to the Future of the Game on iPhone, Mac, PC and PlayStation Network.

776
00:59:57,177 --> 01:00:00,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully Steam is having another Uber sale this holiday too.

777
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:00,761
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be nice.

778
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:01,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

779
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:03,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep an eye on that.

780
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:09,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, if that's it for the US, let's travel to Japan and look at the Japanese releases and what's coming out over there.

781
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:14,788
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 22nd of December, Cybertroopers Virtual on Force comes out in Japan.

782
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:17,050
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a regular and a box set edition.

783
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:20,752
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Twin Stick EX coming out in support of that game as well.

784
01:00:20,972 --> 01:00:22,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's all coming out on the 22nd.

785
01:00:23,273 --> 01:00:28,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Since there's no show next week, I'll also mention on the 30th, Dream Club Zero on the Xbox 360 from Tamsoft.

786
01:00:29,617 --> 01:00:32,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to the PlayStation 3.

787
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:35,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobunaga no Yabu Online.

788
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:37,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Shinsei no Shuo.

789
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:40,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this is the first expansion for Nobunaga.

790
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:46,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they have Nobunaga's, like they turned Nobunaga's Ambition into like an online game now.

791
01:00:46,786 --> 01:00:49,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure if this is the online game itself.

792
01:00:49,487 --> 01:00:52,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that had already come out or if this is like the first expansion.

793
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:55,430
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is coming out in Japan on the 22nd.

794
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:59,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the description is in Japanese, so I can't read if that's a regular one or expansion.

795
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:08,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Also coming out on the 23rd of December, Mugen Kairo Hikari to Kage no Hako comes out as well in Japan.

796
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:12,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And this looks like... Oh, it's Echo Chrome 2.

797
01:01:13,414 --> 01:01:14,554
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this game is.

798
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:16,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Echo Chrome, but with colors.

799
01:01:16,235 --> 01:01:17,435
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, it is Echo Chrome 2.

800
01:01:18,055 --> 01:01:19,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a download title.

801
01:01:19,135 --> 01:01:20,296
[SPEAKER_02]: That is actually going to be out there.

802
01:01:20,336 --> 01:01:21,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It supports the PlayStation Move.

803
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:24,588
[SPEAKER_02]: That is coming out on the 23rd.

804
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:31,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the Wii in Japan.

805
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:37,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Momochan Diet Wii Figurobics by Chon Dayon comes out this week on the 23rd.

806
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's another diet game, but get this.

807
01:01:40,722 --> 01:01:42,583
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to see the box art for this game.

808
01:01:42,964 --> 01:01:47,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to copy that little picture, and I'm going to post that in our chat room.

809
01:01:48,388 --> 01:01:51,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kids tell me if you're going to buy that fitness game based on the artwork or not.

810
01:01:52,051 --> 01:01:52,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you think?

811
01:01:53,411 --> 01:01:58,595
[SPEAKER_02]: What does this fitness game have in the box art that most fitness games don't usually have?

812
01:01:59,556 --> 01:02:00,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Asian chick on the front?

813
01:02:00,876 --> 01:02:01,397
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

814
01:02:01,497 --> 01:02:02,878
[SPEAKER_02]: In a bikini, nonetheless.

815
01:02:03,498 --> 01:02:08,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's not only in a bikini, she's kind of peeling down the bottom of her bikini.

816
01:02:08,582 --> 01:02:08,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

817
01:02:08,842 --> 01:02:09,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know what?

818
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,243
[SPEAKER_02]: What a hoe.

819
01:02:10,383 --> 01:02:13,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Jillian Michaels tried that on the cover of her game, and I'm sorry.

820
01:02:13,445 --> 01:02:14,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Not the same effect.

821
01:02:15,286 --> 01:02:15,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same.

822
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, no, I don't want to see your penis.

823
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not the same.

824
01:02:26,052 --> 01:02:29,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Milestone Shooting Collection 2 comes out on the Wii, but who cares?

825
01:02:29,974 --> 01:02:33,416
[SPEAKER_02]: You're all going to be looking at your unopened boxes of Momochan Diet.

826
01:02:35,337 --> 01:02:38,739
[SPEAKER_02]: On the DS, not a lot this week.

827
01:02:38,779 --> 01:02:39,819
[SPEAKER_02]: There really isn't anything.

828
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:45,682
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do get to Saga 3, Jikunohasha, Shadow or Light comes out on January 6th.

829
01:02:47,123 --> 01:02:55,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this is another game in the Saga series, like it's a remake of one of the Saga games, which was what, Final Fantasy Legend here?

830
01:02:55,827 --> 01:02:56,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

831
01:02:58,248 --> 01:03:07,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, going to the PSP, Beyond the Milky Way comes out this week on the PSP, as well as Starry Sky in Autumn, and a big release this week, The Third Birthday.

832
01:03:08,193 --> 01:03:13,636
[SPEAKER_02]: If that doesn't sound familiar to you, that's the new Parasite Eve game coming on PSP, The Third Birthday this week, so...

833
01:03:14,016 --> 01:03:14,536
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

834
01:03:40,661 --> 01:03:42,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go ahead and mention the 31st.

835
01:03:42,842 --> 01:03:46,683
[SPEAKER_07]: We have EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis because kids like tennis.

836
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:48,323
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

837
01:03:50,024 --> 01:03:50,384
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

838
01:03:50,564 --> 01:03:52,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for the release dates this week.

839
01:03:52,864 --> 01:03:56,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back into some news and we have the classic game of the week just a few minutes ahead of us.

840
01:03:56,725 --> 01:03:57,946
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, a story from Loki.

841
01:03:58,666 --> 01:03:58,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

842
01:04:00,146 --> 01:04:00,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

843
01:04:00,806 --> 01:04:01,627
[SPEAKER_10]: This is kind of neat.

844
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:13,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you may remember that they just released the pretty awesome Infinity Blade on the iPhone and iOS App Store.

845
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:20,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's going to be other games supporting the Unreal Development Kit, and it's kind of cool.

846
01:04:21,534 --> 01:04:27,117
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the demos that they were showing off the Unreal Development Kit for was...

847
01:04:27,837 --> 01:04:33,421
[SPEAKER_10]: None other than the long, hopefully not forgotten, epic game, Jazz the Jackrabbit.

848
01:04:34,342 --> 01:04:40,106
[SPEAKER_10]: But now updated in 3D graphics and fun stuff like that.

849
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:47,252
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually some other epic, well, other Unreal Engine games that are coming to the store.

850
01:04:47,272 --> 01:04:54,898
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I think there's actually one, and I don't remember what it was called, but it kind of looked a little bit like World of Warcraft.

851
01:04:55,898 --> 01:05:07,428
[SPEAKER_10]: on um but it was like a tower defense game or something like that or like a hack and slash game with the name dungeon and the title I don't remember exactly what it was but uh it looked pretty cool so um

852
01:05:09,144 --> 01:05:26,332
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I mean, more games supporting the Unreal Engine would be pretty awesome because they can do some pretty sweet looking stuff just even with the limited resources of the iOS and the iPhones and stuff like that.

853
01:05:26,392 --> 01:05:30,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like when I hear that there might be a new Jazz Jackrabbit or whatever, I'm like, oh my God, is it 1994?

854
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:30,674
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.

855
01:05:32,777 --> 01:05:33,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

856
01:05:34,078 --> 01:05:34,638
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

857
01:05:35,879 --> 01:05:40,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else that is new and exciting, I guess, depends what kind of games you play.

858
01:05:40,622 --> 01:05:41,422
[SPEAKER_02]: SingStar.

859
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:43,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, remember SingStar, the karaoke game?

860
01:05:44,484 --> 01:05:45,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also a dance game now.

861
01:05:45,865 --> 01:05:46,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I played your ABBA.

862
01:05:47,105 --> 01:05:47,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, SingStar.

863
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:48,867
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

864
01:06:13,746 --> 01:06:14,527
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

865
01:06:35,885 --> 01:06:38,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see if there's any really, really big songs in here.

866
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:40,408
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a shit ton of Lady Gaga songs.

867
01:06:40,828 --> 01:06:44,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're into Lady Gaga, there's quite a few songs from her first album that are there.

868
01:06:44,551 --> 01:06:47,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bad Romance, because you know you want to make your friends sing Bad Romance.

869
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:50,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Songs from the Jackson 5 are now there.

870
01:06:51,195 --> 01:06:51,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Take That.

871
01:06:53,657 --> 01:06:57,099
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an old school band that I think is getting back together.

872
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that the New Kids on the Block and the Backstreet Boys are going out on tour together?

873
01:07:02,503 --> 01:07:04,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and I actually did see that performance.

874
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:06,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of it being the 90s all over again.

875
01:07:09,805 --> 01:07:11,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody asked me if I wanted to go.

876
01:07:11,505 --> 01:07:12,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, I don't.

877
01:07:13,285 --> 01:07:13,406
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

878
01:07:13,466 --> 01:07:14,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, I'm not.

879
01:07:14,926 --> 01:07:15,046
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

880
01:07:16,686 --> 01:07:22,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can do some dancing to Tiffany, I Think We're Alone Now and Aha!

881
01:07:22,728 --> 01:07:23,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Take On Me.

882
01:07:23,408 --> 01:07:25,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I still like the Birthday Massacre version better.

883
01:07:26,188 --> 01:07:26,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

884
01:07:26,929 --> 01:07:28,589
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, some SingStar stuff for you.

885
01:07:28,922 --> 01:07:38,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's go to the classics video games and talk about an old school game that DarkSakura thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing this week.

886
01:07:38,867 --> 01:07:41,208
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the classic video game of the week.

887
01:07:41,588 --> 01:07:47,891
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's gonna step into the vault, find a game that she says, hey, you got two weeks because of the holiday.

888
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:49,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Play this game.

889
01:07:49,572 --> 01:07:49,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

890
01:07:50,593 --> 01:07:51,473
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the classic game of the week?

891
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:54,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you people are going to have a hard time finding this one.

892
01:07:55,353 --> 01:07:56,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Fantasy Zone.

893
01:07:57,874 --> 01:07:59,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Fantasy Zone.

894
01:07:59,634 --> 01:07:59,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

895
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Fantasy Zone, but Space Fantasy Zone.

896
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:09,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically what this game is is that it is a mix of Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone.

897
01:08:10,635 --> 01:08:14,699
[SPEAKER_07]: and even the music is a little remix of the themes.

898
01:08:16,742 --> 01:08:20,025
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually, with the particular game, it never came out.

899
01:08:21,226 --> 01:08:22,027
[SPEAKER_07]: It was never released.

900
01:08:22,047 --> 01:08:22,888
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a prototype.

901
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:26,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait a minute.

902
01:08:27,453 --> 01:08:33,339
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you actually can find the disc image online.

903
01:08:34,187 --> 01:08:38,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha, so the kiddies are going to have to resort to more scandalous means to play this game.

904
01:08:38,671 --> 01:08:45,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't necessarily say it's scandalous, given that, you know, I don't really think there's any kind of restriction on it.

905
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:50,061
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is really pretty.

906
01:08:50,462 --> 01:08:54,225
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still got the same kind of Space Harrier scaling issues.

907
01:08:54,405 --> 01:08:56,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty minimalist, but...

908
01:08:57,879 --> 01:09:04,102
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that actually I didn't really care for in it, too, is that it is a little bit harder to hit stuff, but it's still so freaking cute.

909
01:09:04,242 --> 01:09:07,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because the game Space Harrier is set in the Fantasy Zone.

910
01:09:07,584 --> 01:09:09,324
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, welcome to Fantasy Zone, get ready.

911
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:12,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So it takes two of the best things and just puts them together.

912
01:09:12,786 --> 01:09:19,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, your bosses are some of your classic Fantasy Zone bosses.

913
01:09:20,249 --> 01:09:22,550
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just really neat, and it's cute.

914
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:23,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

915
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:31,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is just, it's something for people who love Space Harrier or Fantasy Zone.

916
01:09:31,677 --> 01:09:33,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's really all that it is.

917
01:09:35,047 --> 01:09:36,048
[SPEAKER_07]: It's eye candy.

918
01:09:36,268 --> 01:09:40,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and you can go into your little shops and buy stuff.

919
01:09:40,231 --> 01:09:47,097
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got the same lady from the shops in Fantasy Zone and get all kinds of goodies.

920
01:09:47,357 --> 01:09:48,438
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just cute.

921
01:09:48,538 --> 01:09:50,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's really all I can say about it.

922
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:56,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's got the Opa Opa and his little feet sticking out going, I'm the Opa Opa.

923
01:09:57,813 --> 01:09:58,153
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

924
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:16,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to throw the two together.

925
01:10:32,393 --> 01:10:43,121
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, oddly enough, I wouldn't exactly... I don't really classify Space Fantasy Zone on some... You see, the other reason why I'm bringing it up for the classic game is that it is... You can play the whole thing.

926
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:43,761
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

927
01:10:43,981 --> 01:10:46,023
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, a nice waste of time.

928
01:10:46,863 --> 01:10:52,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Not... There usually are a few issues with the disc, too, and burning, so you have to be really careful when you do it.

929
01:10:53,668 --> 01:10:56,390
[SPEAKER_07]: But... Like, see, there's the wood face thing.

930
01:10:56,590 --> 01:11:02,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like how the bosses in this game kind of look like the bosses from the original Fantasy Zone.

931
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:02,991
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they are the bosses.

932
01:11:03,932 --> 01:11:04,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean, though.

933
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,092
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in that whole 3D environment.

934
01:11:06,772 --> 01:11:07,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So, kind of neat.

935
01:11:07,652 --> 01:11:10,453
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really had to just throw it out there.

936
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:19,135
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a game that I think any fan of Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier should at least give a look at.

937
01:11:19,474 --> 01:11:22,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's some listeners that aren't going to know, so I have to ask.

938
01:11:22,057 --> 01:11:26,321
[SPEAKER_02]: You just said your second favorite game ever is Fantasy Zone and your third favorite ever is Space Harrier.

939
01:11:26,802 --> 01:11:27,582
[SPEAKER_02]: What's number one?

940
01:11:28,443 --> 01:11:29,685
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be Guardian Legend.

941
01:11:30,325 --> 01:11:31,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen, sister.

942
01:11:31,627 --> 01:11:33,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Guardian Legend, most underrated NES game ever.

943
01:11:34,109 --> 01:11:35,030
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is so great.

944
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:35,591
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

945
01:11:36,311 --> 01:11:37,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely astounding.

946
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:40,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as good any of those games as Super Metroid, but they're all still really good.

947
01:11:41,751 --> 01:11:43,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's your favorite game.

948
01:11:43,411 --> 01:11:43,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

949
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:56,134
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, so really, I know it's not an official released game, and yeah, I've got a few prototypes of other stuff, but this is one prototype that you can get the full version of out there.

950
01:11:56,214 --> 01:11:58,234
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not unavailable.

951
01:11:58,294 --> 01:12:02,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you can't find an official printing of it or something without spending the bucks.

952
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:03,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

953
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:07,396
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, and I don't think there's any real reason about why it wasn't released.

954
01:12:07,436 --> 01:12:09,216
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have been something about licensing issues.

955
01:12:09,296 --> 01:12:09,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

956
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:13,390
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just fun.

957
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:16,193
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even really the greatest game ever.

958
01:12:16,954 --> 01:12:20,138
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is something that's worth playing.

959
01:12:20,398 --> 01:12:21,720
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that's worth checking out.

960
01:12:22,461 --> 01:12:24,884
[SPEAKER_07]: And at least, you know, watch the video.

961
01:12:24,944 --> 01:12:25,484
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cute.

962
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:29,910
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still love the PC Engine.

963
01:12:31,374 --> 01:12:34,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's going to do it for Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio.

964
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:35,336
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

965
01:12:35,356 --> 01:12:37,537
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty more to come in Part B tonight.

[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure to get those in.

[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, your phone calls will be coming up later in the program, as well as some rapid-fire news, some really quick news stories of what's going on, and some other game-related news stories, including one about sex.

970
01:12:56,008 --> 01:12:59,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So you better stay tuned for more of Orange Lounge Radio.

971
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,610
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

972
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:01,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a mic off.

973
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:03,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about sex.

974
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:05,195
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a George Michael song.

975
01:13:06,116 --> 01:13:06,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

976
01:13:07,017 --> 01:13:08,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that that was Salt-N-Pepa.

977
01:13:09,139 --> 01:13:09,819
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Salt-N-Pepa.

978
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, whatever.

979
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,423
[SPEAKER_10]: They both had songs about sex, among many others.

980
01:13:13,763 --> 01:13:19,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, George Michael was the one that got busted for, well, it wasn't really sex, but you know what?

981
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:20,390
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to go to break.

982
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:23,193
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back in a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

983
01:13:29,226 --> 01:13:31,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

984
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:38,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live on this Sunday evening, December the 19th of 2010 with the 394th episode of our show.

985
01:13:38,834 --> 01:13:44,679
[SPEAKER_02]: We are taping live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com if you've ever wanted to join us for a live show.

986
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Tune in at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

987
01:13:50,024 --> 01:13:52,026
[SPEAKER_02]: But not next week because we won't be here next week.

988
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:55,209
[SPEAKER_02]: But tune in in early January when we will be back.

989
01:13:56,189 --> 01:13:58,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the break, we were playing some music from Space Invaders.

990
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:02,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, we can't play it on the podcast because it's copyright.

991
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:05,711
[SPEAKER_02]: But, Loki, you were saying something about the whole Space Invaders on the App Store.

992
01:14:05,751 --> 01:14:06,652
[SPEAKER_02]: You were not a fan, right?

993
01:14:06,772 --> 01:14:08,432
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Infinity Gene is terrible.

994
01:14:09,292 --> 01:14:09,852
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

995
01:14:09,972 --> 01:14:10,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it.

996
01:14:10,973 --> 01:14:11,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

997
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,073
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I kind of agree.

998
01:14:13,133 --> 01:14:15,614
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not nearly as good as Extreme.

999
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:18,654
[SPEAKER_10]: When you play Extreme, it's just awesome.

1000
01:14:18,734 --> 01:14:23,096
[SPEAKER_10]: But Infinity Gene was just, no, not cool.

1001
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:24,896
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

1002
01:14:25,356 --> 01:14:28,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, during the break, I also got a present from Loki.

1003
01:14:28,379 --> 01:14:29,120
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Loki.

1004
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,582
[SPEAKER_02]: He bought me something on the App Store.

1005
01:14:31,203 --> 01:14:32,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Raider 2.

1006
01:14:33,065 --> 01:14:34,026
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Dungeon Hunter 2.

1007
01:14:34,146 --> 01:14:35,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's very much like Diablo.

1008
01:14:36,508 --> 01:14:36,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1009
01:14:37,029 --> 01:14:37,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, awesome.

1010
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:38,771
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I love me some Diablo.

1011
01:14:38,871 --> 01:14:39,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So great.

1012
01:14:39,512 --> 01:14:39,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1013
01:14:39,852 --> 01:14:42,355
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jamie has something coming her way, too.

1014
01:14:42,595 --> 01:14:42,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo-hoo.

1015
01:14:43,556 --> 01:15:08,726
[SPEAKER_02]: presence in studio good times speaking of presence we should actually let the I gave you guys your presence before the show uh-huh oh yes I forgot we didn't talk about those on air yeah DarkSakura got me a World of Warcraft trivia calendar because she knows I'm an addict and so now I have a little desk calendar for work that I can tear off each day and then like I can mark things a little post-it notes like e3 and some of the big events during the years I can see how long it is till e3

1016
01:15:09,306 --> 01:15:12,488
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was working, I actually had three different calendars like that on my desk.

1017
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:16,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the Redneck Dictionary, which I just thought was funny.

1018
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:20,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I had the Yiddish Word of the Day.

1019
01:15:21,472 --> 01:15:28,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I had another one that was, oh yeah, like random facts that they won't tell you about or something.

1020
01:15:28,236 --> 01:15:28,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was pretty cool.

1021
01:15:29,577 --> 01:15:32,118
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got Loki Family Guy Calendar.

1022
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:34,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you.

1023
01:15:34,717 --> 01:15:38,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm definitely going to put this up on my desk because all I have is... What was it?

1024
01:15:39,081 --> 01:15:41,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Axis Game Localization gave me a calendar.

1025
01:15:42,064 --> 01:15:44,165
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's tiny.

1026
01:15:44,486 --> 01:15:45,667
[SPEAKER_10]: And not Family Guy.

1027
01:15:45,887 --> 01:15:49,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this has quotes on it that I can actually put on my marquee.

1028
01:15:50,771 --> 01:15:51,311
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1029
01:16:13,126 --> 01:16:18,107
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you do a show as well, and you're running some year-end specials right now, right?

1030
01:16:38,752 --> 01:16:41,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we do one called Comic Insanity.

1031
01:16:42,075 --> 01:16:43,416
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on Infamous.net.

1032
01:16:43,476 --> 01:16:50,140
[SPEAKER_07]: That's with no I in front of the N. And it's me and Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.

1033
01:16:50,281 --> 01:16:52,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And we talk about comics.

1034
01:16:54,263 --> 01:17:14,779
[SPEAKER_07]: and we talk about Shadow's hatred of Hulk people and the love-hate relationship of Marvel and Matt Fraction who's writing Iron Man and my cluelessness about just about anything DC Comics related.

1035
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:16,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1036
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:17,601
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1037
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:22,284
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want links to those, both those shows now available at OrangeLawnRadio.com right on the left-hand side.

1038
01:17:22,324 --> 01:17:23,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Little links to both those shows.

1039
01:17:23,825 --> 01:17:23,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1040
01:17:23,945 --> 01:17:24,346
[SPEAKER_02]: How cute.

1041
01:17:24,986 --> 01:17:25,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So awesome.

1042
01:17:26,227 --> 01:17:28,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, don't mention Jeff Loeb.

1043
01:17:29,548 --> 01:17:30,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I want to mention this.

1044
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:32,770
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on orangelaunchradio.com.

1045
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:40,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have to go into the archive a little bit to see this, but our buddies over at Under Sedation Live are doing their annual Madness tournament.

1046
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:42,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It was March Madness.

1047
01:17:42,154 --> 01:17:44,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's just Madness, I think, because it doesn't have a month.

1048
01:17:44,976 --> 01:17:48,498
[SPEAKER_02]: It's USLOLR Madness version 2011.

1049
01:17:49,718 --> 01:17:55,261
[SPEAKER_02]: You should submit your top 25 lists to uslmadness at gmail.com.

1050
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:56,562
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the top 25 games listed.

1051
01:17:57,643 --> 01:17:58,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever!

1052
01:17:58,964 --> 01:18:05,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you are a huge fan of Super Metroid, I'm gonna send my number one to Super Metroid to uslmadness at gmail.com.

1053
01:18:05,309 --> 01:18:15,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you already know, DarkSakura's list is gonna be one, Guardian Legend, two, I'm writing her damn list for her, Fantasy Zone, three, Space Harrier, and continue on through 25.

1054
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:22,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So the nominees to get the most points will be entered into an elimination 64 bracket.

1055
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:24,546
[SPEAKER_02]: uslmadness at gmail.com.

1056
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,188
[SPEAKER_02]: More information available on our website.

1057
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,110
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to scroll back in the news a little bit.

1058
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:29,731
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it is.

1059
01:18:31,353 --> 01:18:31,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1060
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,357
[SPEAKER_02]: All that information at orangelaunchradio.com, of course.

1061
01:18:36,138 --> 01:18:38,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tigerclaw is letting us know that...

1062
01:18:40,154 --> 01:18:42,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, I thought that was about rebroadcast.

1063
01:18:42,296 --> 01:18:44,377
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something else I'll have to chat with him offline about.

1064
01:18:44,898 --> 01:18:54,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick news, some stories that we just don't have the full time to talk about, but we wanted to bring them to your attention nonetheless, Loki.

1065
01:18:55,345 --> 01:18:55,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1066
01:18:57,126 --> 01:18:57,846
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is neat.

1067
01:18:58,226 --> 01:19:03,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Meat Boy, a game we've actually been talking about on the show for a few weeks now and is very awesome.

1068
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:11,933
[SPEAKER_10]: If you happen to have the PC version, apparently they figured out a way to uncover the dev mode located in the game.

1069
01:19:12,493 --> 01:19:15,175
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course it was discovered by the modding community.

1070
01:19:16,055 --> 01:19:21,418
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe it allows you to customize your game a little bit.

1071
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:45,791
[SPEAKER_10]: and of course this is only in the PC version it gives you the keys to the kingdom as they put it and some very user friendly tools in which Team Meat created the game with including the original batch of levels and actually it was kind of cool Team Meat the creators of the game were actually nice enough to post a few tutorial videos explaining how to access and use the tools

1072
01:19:47,252 --> 01:19:48,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1073
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:27,041
[SPEAKER_10]: and of course if you're a fan of Dead Rising 2 you'll be happy to know that on December 27th Dead Rising 2 Case West will be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade it's the exclusive epilogue to the game and will cost you 800 Microsoft points or $10 do want

1074
01:20:29,722 --> 01:20:31,002
[SPEAKER_10]: So that looks pretty awesome.

1075
01:20:31,362 --> 01:20:38,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, they're also going to have the photo part of the game coming back as well for that.

1076
01:20:39,804 --> 01:20:41,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice little after Christmas gift there.

1077
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:47,445
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, Section 8, which was a first-person shooter, came out last August.

1078
01:20:49,326 --> 01:20:50,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I should say August 2009.

1079
01:20:51,506 --> 01:20:56,447
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually did okay at retail and was a full-price game when it came out.

1080
01:20:56,887 --> 01:20:58,408
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1081
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:26,305
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's going to also include a single player campaign, support for up to 32 players in online multiplayer and a new four player co-op mode called Swarm.

1082
01:21:27,025 --> 01:21:39,488
[SPEAKER_10]: It says offline players will also be able to partake in multiplayer as the game can add bots in case you don't have friends or an internet connection to play against.

1083
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:44,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Hamlet, The Game

1084
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:10,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.

1085
01:22:10,662 --> 01:22:12,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hamlet's taking out the trash.

1086
01:22:12,585 --> 01:22:14,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Only it's not real.

1087
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:16,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Hamlet 2?

1088
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,212
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was from Last Action Hero.

1089
01:22:18,753 --> 01:22:20,495
[SPEAKER_02]: To be or not to be?

1090
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:21,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be.

1091
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen Hamlet 2?

1092
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:23,920
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1093
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the dumbest fucking movie.

1094
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:26,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there still kids here?

1095
01:22:28,265 --> 01:22:29,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping not because the door is wide open.

1096
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:31,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there still kids here?

1097
01:22:31,507 --> 01:22:31,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I swear?

1098
01:22:31,887 --> 01:22:32,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

1099
01:22:32,428 --> 01:22:32,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.

1100
01:22:33,008 --> 01:22:34,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the dumbest fucking movie ever made.

1101
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:37,872
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so dumb, it's kind of funny.

1102
01:22:38,132 --> 01:22:39,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, that was Hamlet 2.

1103
01:22:39,393 --> 01:22:42,455
[SPEAKER_02]: But this actually is not really what you would think it is.

1104
01:22:42,576 --> 01:22:44,337
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there's this whole little trailer out there for the game.

1105
01:22:44,817 --> 01:22:46,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very stylized.

1106
01:22:46,797 --> 01:22:47,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that style.

1107
01:22:47,798 --> 01:22:52,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like that limbo-esque thing going on there.

1108
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:55,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's all coming out January 2011.

1109
01:22:56,319 --> 01:22:57,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing the trailer here in studio.

1110
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,680
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an adventure game.

1111
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,341
[SPEAKER_02]: This does not look like Hamlet to play to me.

1112
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is based on Shakespeare's Hamlet.

1113
01:23:09,282 --> 01:23:10,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have no idea how that works.

1114
01:23:11,565 --> 01:23:13,806
[SPEAKER_05]: See, now we need the sassy gay friend to show up.

1115
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:16,448
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?

1116
01:23:16,748 --> 01:23:17,068
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1117
01:23:17,088 --> 01:23:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1118
01:23:17,328 --> 01:23:18,028
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?

1119
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:18,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

1120
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:25,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the rest of the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 roster has been revealed.

1121
01:23:25,552 --> 01:23:26,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been spoiled.

1122
01:23:27,373 --> 01:23:30,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, if you believe the dirty internet rumors.

1123
01:23:30,555 --> 01:23:32,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Sienko from Darkstalkers.

1124
01:23:32,456 --> 01:23:33,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

1125
01:23:33,336 --> 01:23:34,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Akuma from Street Fighter.

1126
01:23:35,257 --> 01:23:36,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Hager from Final Fight.

1127
01:23:36,718 --> 01:23:37,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1128
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:37,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.

1129
01:23:37,438 --> 01:23:38,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's awesome actually.

1130
01:23:39,459 --> 01:23:50,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix, the X-Men, Sentinel from the X-Men, Taskmaster, Avengers-ish, Galactus is the final boss in the Fantastic Four.

1131
01:23:50,202 --> 01:23:52,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Taskmaster would be interesting.

1132
01:23:52,523 --> 01:23:53,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

1133
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:57,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently some other characters that were planned for the game, but they didn't make it.

1134
01:23:57,784 --> 01:24:05,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix Wright, Mega Man, Venom, and Frank West were all planned for the game, but it just didn't happen.

1135
01:24:06,146 --> 01:24:08,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of sad that Frank West won't show up.

1136
01:24:08,147 --> 01:24:09,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of surprising.

1137
01:24:09,047 --> 01:24:11,148
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, he's not the central character in the new game.

1138
01:24:11,528 --> 01:24:12,788
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

1139
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:17,349
[SPEAKER_10]: It would have been an easy port since, you know, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom had him.

1140
01:24:17,789 --> 01:24:18,670
[SPEAKER_10]: You would think, right?

1141
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:19,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Taskmaster...

1142
01:24:21,771 --> 01:24:30,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Taskmaster actually makes sense because he was a regular in the older Deadpool comic for a while.

1143
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:31,330
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1144
01:24:31,991 --> 01:24:46,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, if you like RPGs and you own a PSP, and when I say RPGs, I mean old school RPGs, then seriously, there is an awesome, incredible must-have game that was announced for the PSP this week.

1145
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:47,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be so awesome.

1146
01:24:47,508 --> 01:24:48,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.

1147
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:49,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the dust off the PSP.

1148
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:50,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Break them out.

1149
01:24:51,873 --> 01:25:13,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Squenix has announced that they are bringing Final Fantasy 4 to the PSP and this is not the 3D version that was on the DS but it's being redone in 2D with the graphics in HD a la the Final Fantasy 1 and 2 remakes but here's the thing it's not just Final Fantasy 4 it's

1150
01:25:13,866 --> 01:25:17,089
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also the After Years on one disc.

1151
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:23,775
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the mobile game that came out on WiiWare, and that is also being upgraded to the new treatment, so that is awesome.

1152
01:25:24,456 --> 01:25:29,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy IV Complete Collection for the PSP was revealed by VJump Magazine in Japan this week.

1153
01:25:29,761 --> 01:25:35,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, this has only officially been announced for Japan, but I can't see how this game isn't coming out over here.

1154
01:25:35,947 --> 01:25:38,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is just, oh man, this is just awesome.

1155
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:39,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there it is.

1156
01:25:40,032 --> 01:25:41,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out in Japan this spring.

1157
01:25:42,276 --> 01:25:44,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the U.S., eh, what, summer?

1158
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:45,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Next holiday?

1159
01:25:45,944 --> 01:25:46,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Not soon enough.

1160
01:25:47,507 --> 01:25:47,988
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

1161
01:25:48,028 --> 01:25:48,990
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the news I got.

1162
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:51,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy Tactics The War on the Lions

1163
01:26:14,161 --> 01:26:15,942
[SPEAKER_02]: They were plugging that at E3 this year.

1164
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:17,382
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sure taking them a while to get out.

1165
01:26:17,482 --> 01:26:20,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder what's going on with it, but it looks cute.

1166
01:26:20,344 --> 01:26:21,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the time to get it right.

1167
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:22,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't release something buggy.

1168
01:26:22,765 --> 01:26:23,525
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine by me.

1169
01:26:23,965 --> 01:26:24,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Agreed.

1170
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:31,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, and this should make people pretty happy, is that there's new Rock Band download content for Christmas.

1171
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:38,271
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually is Happy Christmas Wars Over, which is John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

1172
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:39,412
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.

1173
01:26:40,092 --> 01:26:48,376
[SPEAKER_07]: and then Poutatre en Angine, I think, by Anais and Dix-Moi by B.B.

1174
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:52,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Bruns and Verdamp Langhaire, which is by B.A.P.

1175
01:26:53,939 --> 01:27:05,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Nurenwort by Worsen Helden, Phantasma by Linnea, Proibito by Litfilba, I don't know who they are, Jerk It Out by Caesars.

1176
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,808
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of worldly music this week, it sounds like.

1177
01:27:08,148 --> 01:27:08,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1178
01:27:08,809 --> 01:27:09,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Neat.

1179
01:27:09,549 --> 01:27:11,051
[SPEAKER_07]: The only one I care about is the first one.

1180
01:27:11,511 --> 01:27:15,334
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of John Lennon love in Rock Band 3, because he released one of his albums, too.

1181
01:27:15,394 --> 01:27:18,757
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also, well, all the Beatles stuff got released, too.

1182
01:27:18,997 --> 01:27:20,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sure, of course, there was the Beatles game.

1183
01:27:20,859 --> 01:27:22,240
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was the anniversary.

1184
01:27:23,941 --> 01:27:27,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that's right, there was a re-release album, that's right.

1185
01:27:27,464 --> 01:27:27,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1186
01:27:28,225 --> 01:27:28,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1187
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:30,507
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

1188
01:27:31,207 --> 01:27:32,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Dreamcast!

1189
01:27:34,171 --> 01:27:38,076
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually been a confirmation of a Dreamcast collection.

1190
01:27:38,156 --> 01:27:39,538
[SPEAKER_07]: GameStop has a listing for it.

1191
01:27:39,978 --> 01:27:41,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposedly out of Feptember.

1192
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:43,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Feptember.

1193
01:27:43,483 --> 01:27:44,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Why am I saying Feptember?

1194
01:27:44,985 --> 01:27:45,886
[SPEAKER_02]: February.

1195
01:27:47,287 --> 01:27:48,609
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a holiday month.

1196
01:27:48,689 --> 01:27:49,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Faptember.

1197
01:27:50,686 --> 01:27:52,687
[SPEAKER_07]: February 15th for $30.

1198
01:27:55,029 --> 01:28:00,292
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's really not a whole lot saying just that there is something by the Sega marketing VP.

1199
01:28:00,772 --> 01:28:05,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan Pritchard says, and this is a quote, we actually have a Dreamcast collection coming out soon.

1200
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:07,916
[SPEAKER_02]: How descriptive.

1201
01:28:08,396 --> 01:28:09,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's nothing.

1202
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:12,899
[SPEAKER_02]: PSO or GTFO, right?

1203
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:13,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1204
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll take Space Channel 5.

1205
01:28:16,869 --> 01:28:32,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Channel 5 I like just how completely emotionless she says it in the Japanese version whereas you got Apollo Smile who was the most annoying person in the universe being all fabulous and everything in the US one and then the Japanese one you have Space Channel 5

1206
01:28:36,074 --> 01:28:39,519
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I just have to point this out in our chat room at chat.orangesauntradio.com.

1207
01:28:39,759 --> 01:28:42,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Bochikawa says, Faptember sounds good.

1208
01:28:42,262 --> 01:28:43,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make it now.

1209
01:28:43,604 --> 01:28:45,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So Frisbee says, Jerkuary.

1210
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:47,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to say Feptember.

1211
01:28:48,971 --> 01:28:49,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Faptember.

1212
01:28:51,053 --> 01:28:52,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob's dirty.

1213
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:57,512
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it wouldn't be hard to get people to participate.

1214
01:28:57,572 --> 01:28:58,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have what?

1215
01:28:58,552 --> 01:29:00,734
[SPEAKER_02]: You have NaNoWriMo, right?

1216
01:29:00,774 --> 01:29:02,655
[SPEAKER_02]: The writing month where everybody's supposed to write a novel.

1217
01:29:02,695 --> 01:29:05,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how many people can actually write the whole damn novel, right?

1218
01:29:06,097 --> 01:29:09,059
[SPEAKER_02]: November, where you're supposed to be growing out a beard through the entire month.

1219
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:13,122
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think Faptember is something everybody can participate in.

1220
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:14,282
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1221
01:29:15,863 --> 01:29:16,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, DarkSakura.

1222
01:29:16,624 --> 01:29:18,225
[SPEAKER_02]: We should start making banners and buttons.

1223
01:29:18,485 --> 01:29:21,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still trying to find Deadpool on a moped.

1224
01:29:22,307 --> 01:29:23,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you have fun with that.

1225
01:29:23,533 --> 01:29:27,535
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to go to the Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

1226
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:28,816
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

1227
01:29:28,956 --> 01:29:31,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even like pulled up the Twitter at all yet.

1228
01:29:31,878 --> 01:29:32,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to link it in the chat room.

1229
01:29:32,939 --> 01:29:34,440
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you linking?

1230
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:42,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a picture of Deadpool with Taskmaster on a moped that's supposed to, it's done up like the bike from Nakira.

1231
01:29:44,005 --> 01:29:48,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all the, suddenly we are getting all these unsolicited names from, you know, Fat Timber.

1232
01:29:48,808 --> 01:29:50,909
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Sex Timber and Cocktober.

1233
01:29:50,929 --> 01:29:51,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1234
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:56,335
[SPEAKER_02]: and Jessica Harper is quick to point out, women don't fap, we squick.

1235
01:29:59,037 --> 01:30:00,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that was the term for it.

1236
01:30:00,759 --> 01:30:03,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned something new on this episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1237
01:30:03,562 --> 01:30:03,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Squick.

1238
01:30:04,724 --> 01:30:05,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was click.

1239
01:30:06,425 --> 01:30:08,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I always heard like clicking the mouse.

1240
01:30:08,488 --> 01:30:09,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So what, we have Pokuary?

1241
01:30:09,248 --> 01:30:09,349
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1242
01:30:13,673 --> 01:30:13,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1243
01:30:15,074 --> 01:30:19,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, we're getting all this bullshit spam coming from somebody.

1244
01:30:19,098 --> 01:30:23,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta block this user real quick because I seriously can't read our Twitter because it's so bad.

1245
01:30:26,365 --> 01:30:27,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate spammers on Twitter.

1246
01:30:27,486 --> 01:30:28,507
[SPEAKER_02]: They all need to die in a fire.

1247
01:30:28,547 --> 01:30:29,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think so?

1248
01:30:31,524 --> 01:30:32,945
[SPEAKER_07]: How about a boat fire?

1249
01:30:33,765 --> 01:30:34,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1250
01:30:34,946 --> 01:30:35,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's try this again.

1251
01:30:37,007 --> 01:30:38,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Read Twitter and filter that guy out.

1252
01:30:38,849 --> 01:30:39,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, much better.

1253
01:30:40,209 --> 01:30:42,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, there's like no tweets tonight.

1254
01:30:42,071 --> 01:30:42,791
[SPEAKER_02]: What is up with this?

1255
01:30:42,851 --> 01:30:44,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well Spazinator sent us one.

1256
01:30:45,433 --> 01:30:48,335
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two free vids on PlayStation Network again.

1257
01:30:48,415 --> 01:30:49,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh good, we like free vids.

1258
01:30:49,796 --> 01:30:52,037
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting the free vid update from Spazinator.

1259
01:30:52,618 --> 01:30:54,279
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two free vids on PSN again.

1260
01:30:54,359 --> 01:30:59,943
[SPEAKER_02]: The pilot to a new-ish anime series and a promo for Robot Chicken Star Wars 3.

1261
01:31:01,284 --> 01:31:02,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, free promo.

1262
01:31:03,985 --> 01:31:08,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator also wants to know, is WoW cataclysm Shermie approved?

1263
01:31:09,389 --> 01:31:10,310
[SPEAKER_02]: MolesJK.

1264
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:14,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Has, I don't know, has Shermie voiced an opinion on cataclysm?

1265
01:31:14,773 --> 01:31:21,678
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but our overseas friend Rob sent me a card that says Merry fucking Christmas on it.

1266
01:31:22,419 --> 01:31:22,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that card.

1267
01:31:23,299 --> 01:31:24,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said because of Shermie.

1268
01:31:25,487 --> 01:31:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1269
01:31:43,522 --> 01:31:46,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember hearing about this, although I thought I also did.

1270
01:31:46,903 --> 01:31:47,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

1271
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:48,624
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we'll read it anyway.

1272
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:31,765
[SPEAKER_02]: and you got to be one of the top 32 virtual racers in the US if you are one of the top 32 you will compete in March 2011 to be one of 16 finalists and then you get to drive real Nissan racers that's according to the announcement the final winner will get to join the GT Academy they will train with professional drivers at tracks around the world and join a professional racing team

1273
01:32:32,285 --> 01:32:34,608
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess it's all going to be televised like a reality show.

1274
01:32:35,009 --> 01:32:41,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've ever wanted to be on a reality show and you're, I don't know, you're good at Gran Turismo 5 then go for it!

1275
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:43,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be fun.

1276
01:32:44,997 --> 01:32:45,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR

1277
01:33:12,232 --> 01:33:14,955
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty good for being a $6 game.

1278
01:33:15,495 --> 01:33:19,339
[SPEAKER_10]: They sold it over 286,000 times.

1279
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:26,086
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the fastest grossing app ever, according to the website Appmodo.

1280
01:33:28,107 --> 01:33:29,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1281
01:33:29,209 --> 01:33:34,093
[SPEAKER_10]: The old record, I guess, was held by Cut the Rope, which was $1 million in 10 days.

1282
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:37,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize Cut the Rope had caught on so quickly.

1283
01:33:37,812 --> 01:33:40,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of Cut the Rope, but I've never played it, though.

1284
01:33:41,293 --> 01:33:45,914
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought it was one of those games that kind of slowly grew in popularity.

1285
01:33:45,934 --> 01:33:47,995
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, I'm standing corrected.

1286
01:33:48,015 --> 01:33:57,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, Epic Mark Rain, he said that the Game Center numbers that are being reported are quite a bit lower than the actual sales, so more than 1.7 million.

1287
01:33:58,317 --> 01:34:23,830
[SPEAKER_10]: hmm um says uh the says i tweeted because i thought that it'd be obvious that the game center numbers are a subset of our overall sales and not the actual number but several of the reports i saw seem to be confused about that also infinity blade does not require a game center you can choose to cancel and still play the game however i recommend signing up for game center apple has done a great job it's

1288
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:25,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, right.

1289
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:26,831
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, that's where I lost him right there.

1290
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:32,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, did you hear, speaking of like failed Apple launches, did you hear Ping got some new additions in the last week?

1291
01:34:32,772 --> 01:34:33,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Ping?

1292
01:34:33,372 --> 01:34:33,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1293
01:34:33,692 --> 01:34:33,772
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1294
01:34:33,792 --> 01:34:34,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what Ping is?

1295
01:34:34,873 --> 01:34:35,753
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1296
01:34:35,813 --> 01:34:37,333
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, whatever happened to Pooping?

1297
01:34:37,533 --> 01:34:41,074
[SPEAKER_02]: There was that website one of our listeners made, the Pooping site.

1298
01:34:41,434 --> 01:34:47,756
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, no, Ping has now, you can share playlists with your friends.

1299
01:34:48,456 --> 01:34:53,037
[SPEAKER_02]: You can share playlists of songs that you know you could go and then buy on iTunes.

1300
01:34:54,732 --> 01:34:58,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's finally a feature of ping that Twitter doesn't have.

1301
01:34:58,935 --> 01:35:00,436
[SPEAKER_02]: However insignificant it may be.

1302
01:35:02,678 --> 01:35:03,258
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1303
01:35:03,859 --> 01:35:04,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Other fun stuff.

1304
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:07,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Infinity Blade is getting an update next week.

1305
01:35:09,243 --> 01:35:16,628
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be adding some new enemies to face because from what I heard there's only like six that you face each time you play through the game.

1306
01:35:18,609 --> 01:35:22,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're also going to be adding multiplayer soon.

1307
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:23,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Marrow Fiend

1308
01:35:42,577 --> 01:35:44,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's screenshots from a frickin' iPhone?

1309
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:45,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

1310
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,180
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks outstanding.

1311
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:46,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played the game yet?

1312
01:35:47,021 --> 01:35:47,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.

1313
01:35:48,122 --> 01:35:49,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have to show it to you.

1314
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:50,123
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point.

1315
01:35:50,564 --> 01:35:51,905
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trying to do a radio show, absolutely.

1316
01:35:51,925 --> 01:35:52,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I meant later on.

1317
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:53,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, I know.

1318
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:56,829
[SPEAKER_10]: During our music break after the show.

1319
01:35:57,189 --> 01:35:57,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, sounds good.

1320
01:35:58,731 --> 01:36:00,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about sex!

1321
01:36:02,648 --> 01:36:08,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I have your attention, let's talk about this new thing that's on the thingy, that's on the Kinect.

1322
01:36:09,672 --> 01:36:10,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, here's the deal.

1323
01:36:11,413 --> 01:36:20,539
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking earlier about Kinect hacks and, you know, people can play the piano and people can do, you know, whatever, these 3D dancing and all these sorts of things that Kinect.

1324
01:36:20,899 --> 01:36:23,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it didn't take long for somebody to think of sex.

1325
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:26,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's from Thrix with three X's.

1326
01:36:26,682 --> 01:36:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Thrixx.

1327
01:36:28,183 --> 01:36:29,404
[SPEAKER_02]: and Thrixx.

1328
01:36:49,259 --> 01:36:54,701
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kinect hardware is used, plus some of the open drivers in Windows 7 is how it works.

1329
01:36:55,761 --> 01:37:02,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I would play the video for you, but it was removed from YouTube because some people reported it for nudity and sexual content.

1330
01:37:03,143 --> 01:37:03,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo!

1331
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:04,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Ruining all our fun.

1332
01:37:05,064 --> 01:37:05,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo!

1333
01:37:05,464 --> 01:37:13,346
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like all the other sex games that they have out there, like all the anime ones and stuff where you use the mouse and stuff, but instead of using the mouse, you use your hand.

1334
01:37:13,486 --> 01:37:15,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It's honestly not that exciting, people.

1335
01:37:16,127 --> 01:37:16,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not.

1336
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:19,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much exactly what we said.

1337
01:37:19,948 --> 01:37:25,670
[SPEAKER_02]: You rub this magical floaty hand over boobs and the chick goes, you know, ooh, boobs.

1338
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:29,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you might be wondering when this is coming out for the Xbox 360.

1339
01:37:31,131 --> 01:37:31,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1340
01:37:31,532 --> 01:37:32,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really wondering that?

1341
01:37:33,192 --> 01:37:36,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, Microsoft has pretty much said, hell no.

1342
01:37:37,794 --> 01:37:40,115
[SPEAKER_02]: In an interview with IGN, they said, Hold on, hold on.

1343
01:37:40,135 --> 01:37:40,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop right there.

1344
01:37:53,186 --> 01:37:53,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1345
01:37:54,147 --> 01:37:54,607
[SPEAKER_10]: IGN?

1346
01:37:54,747 --> 01:37:55,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1347
01:37:55,127 --> 01:37:55,988
[SPEAKER_10]: You went and asked them?

1348
01:37:56,268 --> 01:38:01,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it wasn't completely obvious to begin with that this was A. First off, never going to come out on a console.

1349
01:38:02,172 --> 01:38:03,933
[SPEAKER_10]: B. It was just a PC game anyways.

1350
01:38:04,153 --> 01:38:06,554
[SPEAKER_10]: And C. It wasn't that interesting of an idea.

1351
01:38:06,934 --> 01:38:12,258
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, you had the spare time to go ask them this so you can get a comment so that you can get some more page hits.

1352
01:38:12,978 --> 01:38:13,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job!

1353
01:38:13,899 --> 01:38:19,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree, but at the same time... Maybe you should dedicate a podcast to that too, because they have like 80,000 podcasts.

1354
01:38:20,244 --> 01:38:28,671
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of bullshit, because, you know, and I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but if somebody really wants to waste $60 on this, then you know what?

1355
01:38:28,851 --> 01:38:29,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them.

1356
01:38:29,792 --> 01:38:30,072
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

1357
01:38:31,774 --> 01:38:35,256
[SPEAKER_02]: How is this any worse than some of the Bang Bang Shoot'em Up games that are out there?

1358
01:38:35,296 --> 01:38:38,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, Mafia 2 that was brought up earlier in the show.

1359
01:38:38,758 --> 01:38:41,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sick of this double standard of sex versus violence.

1360
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:49,485
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a double standard, and I bet you anything that this will come out in Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball 3 where you can tickle them.

1361
01:38:49,926 --> 01:38:51,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's just tickling.

1362
01:38:52,587 --> 01:38:54,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a giant feather that's in your hand.

1363
01:38:54,669 --> 01:38:58,932
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not actually your hand, but it's a giant feather, and you can go tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, and they'll go hee, hee, hee.

1364
01:38:59,112 --> 01:39:00,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And their boobs will move, yeah.

1365
01:39:01,113 --> 01:39:02,574
[SPEAKER_02]: But that'll be okay.

1366
01:39:02,654 --> 01:39:03,494
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be alright.

1367
01:39:03,674 --> 01:39:06,936
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, would you play Dead or Alive if it had booby-tickling connect mode?

1368
01:39:07,596 --> 01:39:07,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1369
01:39:12,658 --> 01:39:14,159
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to unlock things.

1370
01:39:14,279 --> 01:39:17,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they should have the dudes in the game.

1371
01:39:18,701 --> 01:39:19,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this is the thing.

1372
01:39:19,722 --> 01:39:21,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Boobs are a lot more fun than junk.

1373
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:24,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for bounciness.

1374
01:39:27,305 --> 01:39:29,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm with you on that.

1375
01:39:29,978 --> 01:39:35,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, there's people going, why don't they have one with dudes and speedos and everything?

1376
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:40,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised they don't have, like, a beach, you know, beachwear mode in, like, Dead or Alive, you know?

1377
01:39:40,722 --> 01:39:42,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there the whole volleyball game or whatever?

1378
01:39:42,703 --> 01:39:43,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was the volleyball.

1379
01:39:44,303 --> 01:39:46,424
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm talking about, like, actual fighting, you know?

1380
01:39:48,725 --> 01:39:51,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I feel about this at chat.orangelandrena.com.

1381
01:39:51,887 --> 01:39:57,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Long Sagat, I don't know, in our chat room says, poop should be cool in video games.

1382
01:39:57,872 --> 01:40:00,013
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think that's ever really cool.

1383
01:40:00,073 --> 01:40:07,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some things, you know, again, if that's what somebody really wants to pay 60 bucks on is poop the game, then you know what?

1384
01:40:07,839 --> 01:40:08,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun.

1385
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:09,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Go play Conker's Bad Fur Day.

1386
01:40:09,821 --> 01:40:12,543
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, you can poop for free like every day.

1387
01:40:12,643 --> 01:40:14,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Just eat more fiber, you know?

1388
01:40:14,684 --> 01:40:16,346
[SPEAKER_02]: But tickling chicks with feathers, that's...

1389
01:40:16,906 --> 01:40:18,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't Shit Your Pants

1390
01:40:39,952 --> 01:41:02,184
[SPEAKER_02]: anything is possible on the PC and that's why folks PC gaming will never cease to exist and you think that poop is not in games yet or at least not enough in games just wait Duke Nukem Forever hasn't come out yet so I'm sure there will be plenty of poop in that I love this oh my god this is the best comment ever and I can't pronounce this name

1391
01:41:02,884 --> 01:41:10,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Kasson, Khan with an S, says to Long Sagat about his whole poop thing, fiber, uppercut.

1392
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:14,470
[SPEAKER_02]: You win.

1393
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:15,150
[SPEAKER_02]: You win.

1394
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:17,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatter of the evening right there.

1395
01:41:17,391 --> 01:41:18,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound the bells and whistles.

1396
01:41:19,372 --> 01:41:20,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude whose name I can't pronounce.

1397
01:41:22,113 --> 01:41:24,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

1398
01:41:24,214 --> 01:41:25,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiber, uppercut.

1399
01:41:25,055 --> 01:41:25,355
[SPEAKER_02]: You win.

1400
01:41:31,983 --> 01:41:32,444
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.

1401
01:41:32,884 --> 01:41:33,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Only on Orange Lounge Radio.

1402
01:41:35,045 --> 01:41:38,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could get away from the sex topic for a minute here, DarkSakura.

1403
01:41:38,226 --> 01:41:40,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have something maybe a little more legitimate for us?

1404
01:41:41,348 --> 01:41:42,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow the Hedgehog.

1405
01:41:42,649 --> 01:41:43,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Barf!

1406
01:41:43,729 --> 01:41:44,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Barf, barf, barf.

1407
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:45,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously?

1408
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:45,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1409
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:46,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, basically...

1410
01:41:48,131 --> 01:41:53,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega wanted to talk about why we got Shadow the Hedgehog.

1411
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:56,518
[SPEAKER_07]: They thought it would work for US gamers.

1412
01:41:58,139 --> 01:42:06,546
[SPEAKER_07]: The producer of Sonic Colors, Takashi Izuka, said, "...after Sonic Adventure, we had two studios, one in the US, one in Japan."

1413
01:42:07,406 --> 01:42:14,452
[SPEAKER_07]: "...and to continue the quote, the Japanese studio was to develop a Sonic game in the standard style, and the US was to develop something different which could contribute to the Sonic franchise."

1414
01:42:15,272 --> 01:42:19,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, he was made to work in the U.S.

1415
01:42:19,775 --> 01:42:23,657
[SPEAKER_07]: because first and third person shooters were popular and they wanted someone who could work with it.

1416
01:42:24,197 --> 01:42:26,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Hence, we got Shadow the Gangsta Hedgehog.

1417
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:37,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But what they haven't realized is that we like Sonic because it's not standard American fare.

1418
01:42:38,095 --> 01:42:54,468
[SPEAKER_02]: File this under the Americans are so stupid bin More like, don't try to guesstimate what a completely different culture is going to like Why is it that every time there's a game that's targeted at America, it usually really stinks?

1419
01:42:55,289 --> 01:43:04,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe I'm just doing an overall broad generalization I thought it was a cool looking character, really well designed But other than that, the concept was just crap

1420
01:43:05,097 --> 01:43:06,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Sonic Colors Sonic Colors

1421
01:43:27,828 --> 01:43:28,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out already.

1422
01:43:28,788 --> 01:43:31,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but I can't afford it right now.

1423
01:43:31,609 --> 01:43:35,810
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a game that was targeted for the US or whatever that wasn't that bad.

1424
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:39,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret of Evermore was horribly underrated.

1425
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:41,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually was a pretty good game.

1426
01:43:41,551 --> 01:43:42,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had the Super Nintendo.

1427
01:43:42,891 --> 01:43:45,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably still have the Super Nintendo cart in a bin somewhere.

1428
01:43:45,671 --> 01:43:49,532
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that was not as terrible as people made it out to me.

1429
01:43:49,672 --> 01:43:53,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was no second to Setsu 3, but it was good in its own way.

1430
01:43:54,373 --> 01:44:21,757
[SPEAKER_02]: and wasn't that the first game that uh what's his name the guy who does all the music for like Guild Wars and Oblivion Jeremy Soleil he did that was like his first soundtrack I think with Secret of Evermore so I guess it's rare but it does happen occasionally let's move on yes um now I don't I'm gonna try to report this without sounding hateful

1431
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:29,870
[SPEAKER_10]: We could use a Loki rant tonight, I'm just saying.

1432
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:33,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Gran Turismo 5's creator wants to add monthly updates.

1433
01:44:34,611 --> 01:44:35,111
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

1434
01:44:35,551 --> 01:44:36,011
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

1435
01:44:36,472 --> 01:44:39,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Plans premium car upgrades later on, stuff like that.

1436
01:44:40,053 --> 01:44:46,194
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, they're saying that they don't consider their work complete yet.

1437
01:44:46,254 --> 01:44:46,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1438
01:44:46,575 --> 01:44:47,875
[SPEAKER_10]: You think that that game wasn't

1439
01:44:48,275 --> 01:44:59,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Rush to market because it's been in development for years now and they really need to get it out this year because delaying it again, people would just kind of roll their eyes at them.

1440
01:44:59,703 --> 01:45:09,930
[SPEAKER_10]: But I remember there's only about a fifth of the vehicles that are represented in the game right now with premium models, which feature higher resolution textures.

1441
01:45:10,251 --> 01:45:10,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's right.

1442
01:45:10,851 --> 01:45:14,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the models in the game aren't quite as finished as others.

1443
01:45:15,074 --> 01:45:25,662
[SPEAKER_10]: But don't worry, they're going to be adding patches later on to add some new items, including new premium cars available for download.

1444
01:45:26,442 --> 01:45:29,424
[SPEAKER_10]: And they haven't said yet whether those updates will be free.

1445
01:45:29,905 --> 01:45:38,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, so you can pay, or possibly pay more, for more of your game that you purchased that isn't quite done yet.

1446
01:45:38,571 --> 01:45:40,752
[SPEAKER_10]: But don't worry, they'll finish it someday.

1447
01:45:41,393 --> 01:45:42,554
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll call it Gran Turismo 6.

1448
01:45:47,306 --> 01:45:53,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Gran Turismo 6 is going to come out for the PS3, or do you think we're going to wait for the next big system, next console?

1449
01:45:54,249 --> 01:45:54,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1450
01:45:54,789 --> 01:45:56,590
[SPEAKER_02]: What about that whole 10-year life cycle thing?

1451
01:45:56,630 --> 01:45:57,591
[SPEAKER_10]: We're only, what, four years in?

1452
01:45:57,611 --> 01:45:58,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, don't worry.

1453
01:45:58,091 --> 01:46:02,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Gran Turismo 6 Prologue will be coming out, and it will be totally like the game was.

1454
01:46:03,634 --> 01:46:07,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, that's got to... Well, I don't know if it's got to suck for the people that bought Prologue.

1455
01:46:07,556 --> 01:46:10,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think that's a dumb idea to buy the game anyways, Prologue, because...

1456
01:46:12,332 --> 01:46:12,892
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the point?

1457
01:46:13,032 --> 01:46:15,053
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like paying for a demo, basically.

1458
01:46:15,113 --> 01:46:16,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, no, it's a full-featured game.

1459
01:46:18,013 --> 01:46:19,874
[SPEAKER_10]: With, like, you know, very few cars.

1460
01:46:21,254 --> 01:46:22,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well... Oh, sorry.

1461
01:46:22,954 --> 01:46:23,614
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not a demo.

1462
01:46:24,675 --> 01:46:31,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, coming also to the PlayStation 3 very soon, and a lot of people are excited about this, even though this game was already out some time ago.

1463
01:46:31,596 --> 01:46:36,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect 2 is coming out to the PlayStation 3, but there's some, you know, some tweaks and some upgrades and some new things.

1464
01:46:37,437 --> 01:46:39,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect 3, of course, is coming out in 2011.

1465
01:46:39,958 --> 01:46:48,082
[SPEAKER_02]: But you, of course, have this whole weird thing going on where Mass Effect 2 is coming out on the PlayStation 3, but Mass Effect 1 never came out.

1466
01:46:48,443 --> 01:46:52,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I don't own an Xbox, how do I get that experience of Mass Effect 1?

1467
01:46:52,905 --> 01:46:53,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they've figured it out.

1468
01:46:54,245 --> 01:46:59,608
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an interactive comic that's going to come with Mass Effect 2 called Mass Effect Genesis.

1469
01:46:59,948 --> 01:47:01,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it does is a really quick...

1470
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:26,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say it's a playthrough because it's a comic but it's a real quick summary I guess of the 360 and the PC game Mass Effect 1 but you also get to actually do some things in this comic that you did in the original game you get to make they're saying six decisions that you made in Mass Effect 1 that will now impact your Mass Effect 2 game

1471
01:47:26,408 --> 01:47:30,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope one of those decisions is making sweet, sweet love to the alien chick.

1472
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:32,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, wasn't the whole lesbian thing in Mass Effect 1?

1473
01:47:32,831 --> 01:47:34,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that is one decision.

1474
01:47:35,132 --> 01:47:36,593
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not going to hold my breath.

1475
01:47:36,893 --> 01:47:44,917
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, apparently you will get to make some of the decisions and have your game impacted just like you could play Mass Effect 1 and have your game get impacted in Mass Effect 2.

1476
01:47:45,137 --> 01:47:45,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

1477
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:51,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So a PlayStation 3 gamer will get to start the game...

1478
01:47:53,762 --> 01:48:01,686
[SPEAKER_02]: do the opening sequence and then they're going to go into this comic that I guess will then impact the game later on so that's kind of cool I like that

1479
01:48:03,604 --> 01:48:25,923
[SPEAKER_02]: so again that is coming out in January Mass Effect 1 they are saying is not going to come out for the Playstation 3 because they're going to move on to Mass Effect 3 so this is as close as you're ever going to get unless you happen to own a PC which you probably do if you're listening to this show and you can go play Mass Effect 1 I don't know if Mac has Mass Effect 1 if it does it's probably on Steam there you go

1480
01:48:27,489 --> 01:48:38,699
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go now to the mailbag where folks can send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and every week we read your emails live here on air and respond to them.

1481
01:48:39,519 --> 01:48:43,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Two emails.

1482
01:48:45,154 --> 01:48:56,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi everyone, I have a question that can possibly be answered by the OLR gang and chatroom.

1483
01:48:57,438 --> 01:49:01,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an avid knitter and I'm looking for video game character garments that look like they were knitted.

1484
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:12,183
[SPEAKER_07]: The only two examples I can think of are Riku's scarf from Final Fantasy X-2 and Nora's SCM sweater slash vest in Final Fantasy XIII Pictures Attached.

1485
01:49:12,763 --> 01:49:23,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got no problems, no projects going on and I'm waiting to start Nora's Sweater Slash Vest as soon as I get patterns from someone to make them up for me because I don't know anything about sewing and patterns.

1486
01:49:23,488 --> 01:49:24,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much, Stan.

1487
01:49:25,229 --> 01:49:25,469
[SPEAKER_07]: P.S.

1488
01:49:25,509 --> 01:49:30,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Last time I wrote in I was telling you about how a friend said I wasn't a gamer because I didn't like certain games.

1489
01:49:30,791 --> 01:49:32,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I confronted him and we're cool now.

1490
01:49:32,692 --> 01:49:37,875
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, the other friend was with us when I brought it up and made them both listen to that episode of your show and now he's a fan.

1491
01:49:38,175 --> 01:49:38,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I already share this?

1492
01:49:39,395 --> 01:49:39,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know.

1493
01:49:40,056 --> 01:49:40,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

1494
01:49:41,076 --> 01:49:41,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

1495
01:49:41,837 --> 01:49:42,578
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

1496
01:49:43,058 --> 01:49:46,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really awesome that we can make fun of your friend and he's still a fan of the show.

1497
01:49:46,882 --> 01:49:47,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1498
01:49:48,084 --> 01:49:50,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm checking out this... Oh, yeah.

1499
01:49:50,406 --> 01:49:51,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're into the whole knitting thing.

1500
01:49:53,209 --> 01:49:54,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I crochet, Rob.

1501
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:56,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I always get the two confused.

1502
01:49:56,452 --> 01:49:57,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, knitting...

1503
01:49:59,099 --> 01:50:03,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you can do more with knitting, but I don't have the coordination for it.

1504
01:50:03,043 --> 01:50:06,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when I tried to learn again, it really made my hand hurt.

1505
01:50:07,427 --> 01:50:13,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, crochet will do it to me after a while because I finished a hat for Becky that was really... Yeah, but you got that whole trigger finger thing still, don't you?

1506
01:50:13,933 --> 01:50:17,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Like residual stuff from when that was really bothering you.

1507
01:50:17,696 --> 01:50:19,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sure there's also characters that wear hats.

1508
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:23,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would think like a lot of like, I don't know, for some reason I think of the Zelda world.

1509
01:50:24,222 --> 01:50:26,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think of a game you should look up is Eternal Sonata.

1510
01:50:27,064 --> 01:50:30,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know if there was a lot, but I don't know why I just think of that game.

1511
01:50:30,906 --> 01:50:38,590
[SPEAKER_02]: But something that could be like a creative idea, like if you're really looking for projects that, you know, I kind of see these things online once in a while, and I always thought they were kind of cool.

1512
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:40,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, look up 8-bit sprites.

1513
01:50:41,412 --> 01:50:45,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of websites around that have like 8-bit sprite repositories.

1514
01:50:45,174 --> 01:50:45,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1515
01:50:47,575 --> 01:50:47,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1516
01:50:47,775 --> 01:50:57,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was going to say you could do, I mean, but still it kind of gives you an idea like how to knit, like if you want to make like a blanket or some other type of throw or something.

1517
01:50:57,601 --> 01:50:59,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe I'm actually talking about knitting.

1518
01:51:00,962 --> 01:51:04,204
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get some ideas for patterns from like old school 8-bit sprites, I would think.

1519
01:51:04,284 --> 01:51:06,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're not going to get clothed patterns, but.

1520
01:51:07,346 --> 01:51:14,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to sit and draw it, but I did have a plan for a much later project of crocheting a Tetris blanket.

1521
01:51:16,251 --> 01:51:16,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's fun.

1522
01:51:17,293 --> 01:51:22,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd crochet it actually in the blocks and then attach the box with yarn.

1523
01:51:23,937 --> 01:51:26,819
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now I don't have the time or patience for it.

1524
01:51:27,059 --> 01:51:30,862
[SPEAKER_02]: What about like a pillow front thing or is that more of a needle point type of thing?

1525
01:51:31,342 --> 01:51:32,463
[SPEAKER_07]: You could crochet a sham.

1526
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:38,604
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as like actual clothing, gosh, nothing really comes to mind for me.

1527
01:51:38,905 --> 01:51:41,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best place to go would be RPGs.

1528
01:51:41,507 --> 01:51:44,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know why, but I'm thinking of the characters from Eternal Sonata.

1529
01:51:44,109 --> 01:51:47,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've seen one that had a lot of knitting type stuff.

1530
01:51:48,592 --> 01:51:48,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1531
01:51:49,773 --> 01:51:50,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1532
01:51:50,334 --> 01:51:51,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Dan know?

1533
01:51:51,895 --> 01:51:55,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, do you know video game characters that wear knitted outfits?

1534
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:58,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Did he give you the face?

1535
01:51:59,261 --> 01:52:00,822
[SPEAKER_02]: He just gave me this face of shit.

1536
01:52:00,882 --> 01:52:01,062
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1537
01:52:01,402 --> 01:52:02,123
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Rob, I don't.

1538
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:06,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance is Earthbound.

1539
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:07,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Earthbound.

1540
01:52:08,572 --> 01:52:09,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Ness's Sweat.

1541
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:10,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

1542
01:52:10,415 --> 01:52:11,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Knitting advice from Dan.

1543
01:52:11,696 --> 01:52:14,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Ness's Sweater could very well be knitted.

1544
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:15,601
[SPEAKER_02]: What a wonderful idea.

1545
01:52:16,542 --> 01:52:17,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would have thought?

1546
01:52:17,043 --> 01:52:18,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance is Freddy Krueger.

1547
01:52:19,726 --> 01:52:21,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, there's Nightmare on Elm Street.

1548
01:52:21,028 --> 01:52:21,489
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a game.

1549
01:52:24,407 --> 01:52:26,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan goes, a really bad game.

1550
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:28,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, did he send pictures of his projects?

1551
01:52:28,552 --> 01:52:30,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm seeing pictures of the characters.

1552
01:52:30,314 --> 01:52:31,015
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just the characters.

1553
01:52:31,035 --> 01:52:32,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we need to see pictures of your work.

1554
01:52:33,358 --> 01:52:35,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll be awaiting those pictures.

1555
01:52:36,222 --> 01:52:38,906
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really... See, I think in a lot of games...

1556
01:52:39,366 --> 01:52:39,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, last email.

1557
01:53:04,008 --> 01:53:04,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys!

1558
01:53:04,948 --> 01:53:05,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

1559
01:53:06,168 --> 01:53:11,730
[SPEAKER_07]: For Festivus slash Decemberween, one of my friends gifted me with her PlayStation 2, which she no longer uses.

1560
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:12,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice gift.

1561
01:53:13,110 --> 01:53:18,551
[SPEAKER_07]: This is extremely awesome considering that one of my evil exes took my old PS2.

1562
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:26,633
[SPEAKER_07]: The downside is that the only PS2 game I still own is Final Fantasy X. How about helping me to rebuild my PS2 library by suggesting a few good games for me to buy?

1563
01:53:26,853 --> 01:53:27,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Tiara.

1564
01:53:28,393 --> 01:53:28,753
[SPEAKER_07]: P.S.

1565
01:53:29,393 --> 01:53:30,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, Rob, I want to be on Horde House 11DR.

1566
01:53:32,174 --> 01:53:34,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted her on last week, but it didn't work out.

1567
01:53:34,435 --> 01:53:36,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll talk to you offline, Tiara.

1568
01:53:37,017 --> 01:53:38,798
[SPEAKER_02]: We do want to have you on as a guest, so maybe next week.

1569
01:53:40,038 --> 01:53:41,319
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to find a Thursday that you're free.

1570
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:42,940
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway.

1571
01:53:43,598 --> 01:53:44,538
[SPEAKER_06]: PS2 games.

1572
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:45,939
[SPEAKER_02]: PS2 games.

1573
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Any of the Silent Hills that came out?

1574
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:48,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely the Silent Hill games.

1575
01:53:49,261 --> 01:53:50,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I would say get Silent Hill 2 and 3.

1576
01:53:51,922 --> 01:53:58,846
[SPEAKER_02]: If Tiara owns Final Fantasy X, then I'm going to guess that she's a role-play game type fan.

1577
01:53:59,226 --> 01:54:00,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely X-2.

1578
01:54:00,086 --> 01:54:05,129
[SPEAKER_02]: XII was horrifically underrated because it came out right when the new consoles were coming out.

1579
01:54:05,489 --> 01:54:05,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll lend you mine.

1580
01:54:05,969 --> 01:54:06,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good one.

1581
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:10,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the .hack games were always really underrated.

1582
01:54:10,971 --> 01:54:14,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that whole simulated MMO thing, but they're a little more action-y.

1583
01:54:14,812 --> 01:54:16,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those are really good to look into.

1584
01:54:16,293 --> 01:54:17,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the name of the first one.

1585
01:54:17,433 --> 01:54:21,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's .hack, Volume 1, Infection.

1586
01:54:21,194 --> 01:54:21,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dan.

1587
01:54:21,714 --> 01:54:22,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan knows.

1588
01:54:23,135 --> 01:54:26,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Magic Pen Gel was an underlooked RPG game.

1589
01:54:26,956 --> 01:54:30,257
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one where you could draw wieners, and then they could go into battle and stuff.

1590
01:54:30,357 --> 01:54:33,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of fun on that with that game in the early days of the show.

1591
01:54:33,958 --> 01:54:34,759
[SPEAKER_02]: and Graffiti Kingdom.

1592
01:54:35,219 --> 01:54:39,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course there are tons and tons of DDR games if you want to get your music game thing on.

1593
01:54:40,282 --> 01:54:44,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Amplitude and Frequency are both very good games even though you can't play Amplitude online anymore.

1594
01:54:45,305 --> 01:54:46,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the Space Channel 5 package.

1595
01:54:47,126 --> 01:54:50,128
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Space Channel 5 Part 1 and 2 were released together combined.

1596
01:54:50,268 --> 01:54:52,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm unwinding my thing and I'm going into the vault.

1597
01:54:52,389 --> 01:54:56,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think of like other epic PS2 games that came out.

1598
01:54:56,531 --> 01:54:59,473
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is actually taking her microphone into the vault to give TR suggestions.

1599
01:54:59,493 --> 01:55:00,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little stretch.

1600
01:55:01,634 --> 01:55:05,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks in chat, not fans of Final Fantasy XII, actually.

1601
01:55:05,936 --> 01:55:06,456
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't reach.

1602
01:55:07,357 --> 01:55:10,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Jessica Harper is suggesting Kingdom Hearts, of course.

1603
01:55:10,378 --> 01:55:11,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Kingdom Hearts.

1604
01:55:11,178 --> 01:55:12,039
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great one.

1605
01:55:12,359 --> 01:55:13,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Solar Flare suggests Rez.

1606
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:16,521
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one as well.

1607
01:55:17,301 --> 01:55:18,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show you Rez.

1608
01:55:19,142 --> 01:55:21,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Long Sagat suggests the Metal Slug Anthology.

1609
01:55:23,684 --> 01:55:24,784
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always a good one as well.

1610
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:26,405
[SPEAKER_07]: The Metal Gear Solid games.

1611
01:55:26,425 --> 01:55:26,885
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great one.

1612
01:55:28,599 --> 01:55:30,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Good PS2 games you need to have.

1613
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:32,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Katamari Damacy from Ranma.

1614
01:55:32,822 --> 01:55:35,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1615
01:55:35,464 --> 01:55:37,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Dragon Quest VIII was awesome.

1616
01:55:39,847 --> 01:55:41,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1617
01:55:41,308 --> 01:55:42,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still awesome today.

1618
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:48,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiara, that's like $200 worth of video games we just suggested to you.

1619
01:55:48,454 --> 01:55:51,476
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I will lend you my Final Fantasy XII if you're interested.

1620
01:55:52,333 --> 01:55:52,513
[SPEAKER_02]: As do I.

1621
01:56:11,351 --> 01:56:13,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe someone might be bringing some of them in person.

1622
01:56:13,992 --> 01:56:14,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1623
01:56:14,272 --> 01:56:14,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be awesome.

1624
01:56:15,753 --> 01:56:16,613
[SPEAKER_02]: If one is not broke.

1625
01:56:16,854 --> 01:56:17,094
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1626
01:56:17,114 --> 01:56:18,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Good suggestions, guys.

1627
01:56:18,574 --> 01:56:18,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gosh.

1628
01:56:19,055 --> 01:56:19,275
[SPEAKER_02]: More.

1629
01:56:19,355 --> 01:56:19,795
[SPEAKER_02]: More of them.

1630
01:56:19,815 --> 01:56:20,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Just real quickly.

1631
01:56:21,976 --> 01:56:23,056
[SPEAKER_07]: She actually sent me a message.

1632
01:56:23,136 --> 01:56:24,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo, a zillion games.

1633
01:56:24,477 --> 01:56:25,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Xena Saga 1 and 3.

1634
01:56:26,478 --> 01:56:27,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Yakuza.

1635
01:56:27,979 --> 01:56:28,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear Solid 2.

1636
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:31,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow of the Colossus.

1637
01:56:32,421 --> 01:56:35,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Tiara, but Zillion is actually on the Sega Master System.

1638
01:56:38,075 --> 01:56:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1639
01:56:38,676 --> 01:56:39,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for the emails tonight.

1640
01:56:40,017 --> 01:56:44,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some emails for next week.

1641
01:56:45,001 --> 01:56:46,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Jessica Harper is saying, I want to go to Vegas.

1642
01:56:46,982 --> 01:56:47,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me too.

1643
01:56:48,564 --> 01:56:56,650
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you haven't heard that episode of the show, just make sure that Jessica doesn't run into any DDR freak people because you never know what freaky things might happen.

1644
01:56:58,512 --> 01:56:59,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just playing.

1645
01:56:59,412 --> 01:57:00,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just messing because I can.

1646
01:57:01,294 --> 01:57:01,594
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1647
01:57:02,115 --> 01:57:03,115
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just serious.

1648
01:57:03,356 --> 01:57:03,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1649
01:57:03,956 --> 01:57:04,136
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1650
01:57:04,156 --> 01:57:05,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

1651
01:57:05,858 --> 01:57:07,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the part of the show where we get angsty.

1652
01:57:24,684 --> 01:57:27,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't have an FU, to be honest.

1653
01:57:28,386 --> 01:57:29,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually having a great week.

1654
01:57:29,887 --> 01:57:30,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I passed Algebra.

1655
01:57:31,848 --> 01:57:34,249
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to say FU to the Photoshop Selection Tool.

1656
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:37,511
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1657
01:57:37,591 --> 01:57:38,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have an FU of the week?

1658
01:57:39,629 --> 01:57:40,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, FU the Comcast.

1659
01:57:41,231 --> 01:57:42,572
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my surprise.

1660
01:57:43,012 --> 01:57:44,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, big surprise.

1661
01:57:44,734 --> 01:57:49,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, fuck them for not being able to hook up my cable correctly.

1662
01:57:49,298 --> 01:57:56,884
[SPEAKER_10]: It apparently takes them numerous crews to do something very simple like running a drop to the street.

1663
01:57:57,004 --> 01:58:00,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently they have a crew that specializes in underground installations.

1664
01:58:00,587 --> 01:58:03,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but that crew doesn't know how to actually hook up anything.

1665
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:04,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1666
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:38,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I was about to install my own damn cable when I was like, hey, you know what?

1667
01:58:38,375 --> 01:58:39,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hell am I doing this?

1668
01:58:41,538 --> 01:58:47,545
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yes, they really need to, I don't know, get their shit straight.

1669
01:58:49,467 --> 01:58:55,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, gosh, I don't really have a strong FU to follow up to that, but I will say FU to traffic.

1670
01:58:56,232 --> 01:59:01,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to drive to the Bay Area on Friday night, and it took me like three and a half hours to get there thanks to a traffic jam on 880.

1671
01:59:01,857 --> 01:59:01,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So FU 880!

1672
01:59:01,997 --> 01:59:02,157
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck!

1673
01:59:05,479 --> 01:59:06,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan the Man's in the house.

1674
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:07,100
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to give an FU?

1675
01:59:08,001 --> 01:59:08,461
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be on.

1676
01:59:08,481 --> 01:59:08,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello?

1677
01:59:08,841 --> 01:59:09,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello?

1678
01:59:09,042 --> 01:59:09,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're there.

1679
01:59:10,342 --> 01:59:12,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to throw an FU to God.

1680
01:59:12,924 --> 01:59:13,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least the weather.

1681
01:59:14,605 --> 01:59:15,966
[SPEAKER_00]: For really sucking ass.

1682
01:59:16,326 --> 01:59:18,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before I have to drive for like 15 hours.

1683
01:59:19,348 --> 01:59:19,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

1684
01:59:19,909 --> 01:59:20,529
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real cute.

1685
01:59:20,669 --> 01:59:21,630
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all real nice.

1686
01:59:21,990 --> 01:59:22,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Real, real good.

1687
01:59:23,131 --> 01:59:29,815
[SPEAKER_00]: The week that I have to drive someplace, snow and rain and crap from the sky.

1688
01:59:29,875 --> 01:59:31,036
[SPEAKER_00]: And who else can I blame?

1689
01:59:31,056 --> 01:59:31,997
[SPEAKER_00]: God.

1690
01:59:32,037 --> 01:59:32,257
[SPEAKER_00]: God.

1691
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:34,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Suck a dick.

1692
01:59:34,901 --> 01:59:35,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother Nature.

1693
01:59:36,603 --> 01:59:39,425
[SPEAKER_07]: He was also really pissed at me because I was so drawn on Tuesday.

1694
01:59:40,887 --> 01:59:42,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but Dan got over it because he saw it.

1695
01:59:42,749 --> 01:59:45,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say this for the record.

1696
01:59:46,452 --> 01:59:48,995
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what my wife's problem is, but I'm a fair man.

1697
01:59:49,739 --> 02:00:19,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go to the Tron sneak preview on IMAX and I didn't tell her a lot about it because she didn't want to hear about it because she was a little bitter so she got so she got to go to the Tron sneak preview and I was a little bitter but I wasn't going to be like no because I've gotten to go and it all worked out fine for me because thanks to the unstoppable pimp Matt I got to go see it for free and it was awesome it was awesome so I want to throw an F you to Jamie for going to see Tron early

1698
02:00:21,578 --> 02:00:22,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't elbow me.

1699
02:00:22,118 --> 02:00:23,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dan.

1700
02:00:23,799 --> 02:00:23,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Black.

1701
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:24,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Cock.

1702
02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:46,292
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to the show?

1703
02:00:47,694 --> 02:00:51,299
[SPEAKER_02]: One minute we're just giving our little FUs and reading emails.

1704
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:54,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we're just giving out the hot dickings.

1705
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:55,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, that's Dr. Tran.

1706
02:00:58,905 --> 02:01:01,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Jessica's in chat saying, I deserve that FU.

1707
02:01:01,426 --> 02:01:02,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Dan.

1708
02:01:05,168 --> 02:01:06,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's yelling from the other room.

1709
02:01:06,429 --> 02:01:07,089
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't her fault.

1710
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:08,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't her fault.

1711
02:01:10,491 --> 02:01:10,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1712
02:01:10,851 --> 02:01:13,873
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta act on those opportunities.

1713
02:01:14,613 --> 02:01:16,414
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta.

1714
02:01:17,695 --> 02:01:20,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's move on to... Where are we at?

1715
02:01:20,176 --> 02:01:20,817
[SPEAKER_02]: The skypline?

1716
02:01:20,857 --> 02:01:22,978
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we got a couple more stories and then the skypline.

1717
02:01:24,539 --> 02:01:27,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, get a mic or GTFO.

1718
02:01:28,141 --> 02:01:28,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1719
02:01:31,632 --> 02:01:35,974
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR in just a little bit right after two more stories for you guys, Loki.

1720
02:01:37,435 --> 02:01:45,038
[SPEAKER_10]: When I first saw this headline, I was like, sweet, Xbox is finally getting all risque because they said goodbye, gal gun panties.

1721
02:01:45,058 --> 02:01:45,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, ooh.

1722
02:01:47,632 --> 02:01:49,054
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think they would go there.

1723
02:02:06,172 --> 02:02:22,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, I guess 79 days before the game's release in Japan, Microsoft called a meeting with the Gal Gun developer, Alchemist, and they basically said, you know what, we're going to have to censor the game and not put all these panty shots in there.

1724
02:02:23,968 --> 02:02:24,949
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's the point.

1725
02:02:26,050 --> 02:02:27,451
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to sell the game now?

1726
02:02:28,812 --> 02:02:29,593
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying now...

1727
02:02:32,222 --> 02:02:33,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1728
02:02:34,243 --> 02:02:40,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, because I guess the game... I don't know if the game uses the Kinect or whatever.

1729
02:02:43,048 --> 02:02:48,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that they're trying to gear it more towards a family game or now.

1730
02:02:49,031 --> 02:02:49,351
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1731
02:02:49,391 --> 02:02:50,171
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they really should.

1732
02:02:50,191 --> 02:02:51,732
[SPEAKER_02]: A game that's fun for the whole family.

1733
02:02:53,493 --> 02:02:54,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot chicks bending over.

1734
02:02:54,854 --> 02:02:55,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1735
02:02:57,063 --> 02:02:58,344
[SPEAKER_02]: X and A game, come on.

1736
02:02:59,085 --> 02:03:01,566
[SPEAKER_02]: X and A. Here's something you can use the Kinect for.

1737
02:03:01,987 --> 02:03:02,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanking.

1738
02:03:03,488 --> 02:03:07,991
[SPEAKER_02]: When those naughty girls bend over, you can spank them with the Kinect.

1739
02:03:08,752 --> 02:03:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, you know you want it.

1740
02:03:10,053 --> 02:03:10,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanking game?

1741
02:03:10,753 --> 02:03:11,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or no, Loki?

1742
02:03:13,095 --> 02:03:16,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Not my forte, but who am I to judge other people?

1743
02:03:20,598 --> 02:03:21,099
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1744
02:03:36,434 --> 02:03:39,296
[SPEAKER_10]: E was her head T was her cleavage M was her naked vagina censored obviously because it's classy

1745
02:04:01,154 --> 02:04:04,117
[SPEAKER_10]: and AO was tentacles sneaking up.

1746
02:04:04,978 --> 02:04:07,761
[SPEAKER_10]: And Nellie's like, what is that?

1747
02:04:08,481 --> 02:04:10,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, it's tentacle rape.

1748
02:04:10,883 --> 02:04:13,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's something that's popular in Japan, you know, in anime.

1749
02:04:13,466 --> 02:04:15,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just like, what?

1750
02:04:19,649 --> 02:04:33,466
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says Maybe it's the game parents will use when kids ask them where do babies come from SolarFlare in our chatroom at chat.org.com says Rob, spanking teaches kids to hit

1751
02:04:36,305 --> 02:04:41,447
[SPEAKER_02]: One more story for you guys, and it has to do with indie games and the Humble Bundle.

1752
02:04:41,907 --> 02:04:50,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble Bundle 2 was released this past week, and in less than 24 hours after its release, it got over $500,000 in revenue.

1753
02:04:51,032 --> 02:04:55,174
[SPEAKER_02]: This is notable because this was one of those pay-what-you-want type of games.

1754
02:04:56,134 --> 02:04:59,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Five games for whatever you want to pay for it, DRM-free.

1755
02:05:00,296 --> 02:05:03,598
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest payer was Marcus Persson

1756
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:05,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinity Ward's Robert Bowling spent $500.

1757
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:20,200
[SPEAKER_02]: on the pack.

1758
02:05:20,361 --> 02:05:20,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1759
02:05:20,861 --> 02:05:24,263
[SPEAKER_02]: The average price that people are paying for this, $7 and change.

1760
02:05:24,623 --> 02:05:30,626
[SPEAKER_02]: The pack comes with Braid, Cortex Command, Machinarium, Osmos, and Revenge of the Titans.

1761
02:05:31,066 --> 02:05:37,710
[SPEAKER_02]: You can divide your payments between the developers, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Child's Play charity.

1762
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:43,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, if you don't want to pay the developers, you want 100% of your donation to go to Child's Play, go for it.

1763
02:05:44,054 --> 02:05:51,464
[SPEAKER_02]: that indeed is some developers being very humble in allowing that to be sold very cool twitter.com slash humble for more information on that

1764
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:54,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, very cool.

1765
02:05:54,672 --> 02:05:56,113
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go to the Skype line now.

1766
02:05:56,153 --> 02:05:56,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me open it up.

1767
02:05:57,014 --> 02:05:57,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have it open right now.

1768
02:05:58,015 --> 02:05:58,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's open.

1769
02:05:58,535 --> 02:06:03,519
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1770
02:06:03,839 --> 02:06:12,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, if you are going to give us a call on Skype, you do want to give Echo123 a call first to make sure your connection works.

1771
02:06:12,246 --> 02:06:13,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please do us all a favor.

1772
02:06:13,888 --> 02:06:16,289
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on Skype itself, Echo123.

1773
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:19,932
[SPEAKER_02]: The 800 number is a lot easier because all you need for that is a phone.

1774
02:06:19,972 --> 02:06:20,353
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 877-GAME-OLR.

1775
02:06:22,165 --> 02:06:28,007
[SPEAKER_02]: While we wait for some calls, because there's a little bit of a delay between when I ask for calls and when they start coming in, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?

1776
02:06:29,468 --> 02:06:30,028
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't.

1777
02:06:31,329 --> 02:06:36,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting a new trend by Tron-izing a picture of myself like people were doing with Avatar.

1778
02:06:36,711 --> 02:06:37,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

1779
02:06:38,132 --> 02:06:39,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's kind of cute what you're doing.

1780
02:06:39,912 --> 02:06:40,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1781
02:06:41,213 --> 02:06:47,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised there's no, like, filter thingy on Photoshop or one of those programs that will kind of automatically do something-ish.

1782
02:06:48,236 --> 02:06:48,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1783
02:06:49,301 --> 02:06:50,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well let's go to the phone.

1784
02:06:50,662 --> 02:06:51,723
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a call coming in.

1785
02:06:51,823 --> 02:06:54,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1786
02:06:54,486 --> 02:06:54,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1787
02:06:55,367 --> 02:06:56,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is X-Link.

1788
02:06:56,347 --> 02:06:56,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, X-Link.

1789
02:06:56,868 --> 02:06:57,488
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1790
02:06:57,949 --> 02:07:02,833
[SPEAKER_01]: You forgot about one game series in particular for the PS2 and I'm quite upset at you for doing this, Rob.

1791
02:07:03,274 --> 02:07:04,395
[SPEAKER_01]: The Persona series.

1792
02:07:05,709 --> 02:07:07,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought somebody in chat said Persona, and I said it.

1793
02:07:07,991 --> 02:07:08,471
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

1794
02:07:09,212 --> 02:07:12,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, any title with Atlas is pretty much gold.

1795
02:07:12,954 --> 02:07:18,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't come across really one game from Atlas that's really so terrible that I would not talk about it.

1796
02:07:18,478 --> 02:07:21,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, they have a really good game on PS3, Demon's Sword.

1797
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:23,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Or no, what am I thinking?

1798
02:07:23,421 --> 02:07:23,982
[SPEAKER_02]: No, scratch that.

1799
02:07:24,022 --> 02:07:27,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Demon's Souls is the game that's out on PS3.

1800
02:07:27,204 --> 02:07:29,806
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great PS3 exclusive game.

1801
02:07:29,846 --> 02:07:34,749
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I believe it was just given a price reduction because it's in the Greatest Hits series, and the servers,

1802
02:07:35,369 --> 02:07:43,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the stories that missed our show all this week, but I remember reading the servers are going to be open through at least March 2011, if not beyond.

1803
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:52,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely, if you're looking for a long series of playtime with a role-playing game, .hack series is really, really good.

1804
02:07:52,569 --> 02:07:54,351
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the four games, and then there was the...

1805
02:07:55,072 --> 02:07:58,575
[SPEAKER_01]: 3 for the GU, which was happening right after.

1806
02:07:58,635 --> 02:08:01,318
[SPEAKER_01]: So they keep the storyline pretty much intact throughout the whole thing.

1807
02:08:01,358 --> 02:08:10,667
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really cool how you can take your save game from the first game, put in a second, save the second game into the third, the third game into the fourth.

1808
02:08:10,707 --> 02:08:11,868
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can carry it on.

1809
02:08:11,988 --> 02:08:16,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you take it and put it into the GU series, which happened a few years after,

1810
02:08:22,834 --> 02:08:27,798
[SPEAKER_02]: RayCraft in our chatroom is correcting me saying Demon's Souls isn't an Atlus game, they just published it.

1811
02:08:27,858 --> 02:08:28,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, still.

1812
02:08:29,159 --> 02:08:30,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, it's a great game.

1813
02:08:33,622 --> 02:08:36,463
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ100 They don't put their name behind sucky games.

1814
02:08:36,663 --> 02:08:36,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1815
02:08:37,583 --> 02:08:40,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully they'll get President Cat and everything will be well.

1816
02:08:40,504 --> 02:08:40,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1817
02:08:40,944 --> 02:08:42,104
[SPEAKER_02]: They need President Cat.

1818
02:08:42,224 --> 02:08:44,184
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100 Matt is also saying Disgaea.

1819
02:08:44,244 --> 02:08:46,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's a good suggestion.

1820
02:08:48,505 --> 02:08:51,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, if you happen to be in a Japanese region, Earth Defense Force 2.

1821
02:08:51,826 --> 02:08:53,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, good thought.

1822
02:08:54,327 --> 02:08:54,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good thought.

1823
02:08:56,367 --> 02:08:57,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So what else is on your mind, X-Link?

1824
02:08:58,047 --> 02:09:00,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else fun and exciting going on in your gaming world?

1825
02:09:00,851 --> 02:09:01,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.

1826
02:09:01,512 --> 02:09:12,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm kind of disappointed you haven't invited me onto your show yet either, considering that I was the number one achieving core in your guild for quite a while, if I remember correctly, before someone took my spot.

1827
02:09:14,591 --> 02:09:18,793
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quite okay, because I'm not going to be bitter or anything about that at all.

1828
02:09:18,933 --> 02:09:19,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And you shouldn't be.

1829
02:09:19,914 --> 02:09:25,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, there's been a lot of people that have wanted to be on, so we're trying to give everybody a shot.

1830
02:09:25,777 --> 02:09:26,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I'm playing around.

1831
02:09:27,058 --> 02:09:32,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess was only on because we kind of needed someone quickly, so she came back on twice.

1832
02:09:33,221 --> 02:09:34,882
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to get lots of people on.

1833
02:09:36,343 --> 02:09:36,963
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

1834
02:09:37,043 --> 02:09:39,945
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm very much enjoying Cataclysm.

1835
02:09:40,697 --> 02:09:44,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping up to the wee hours in the morning playing all the different stuff for it.

1836
02:09:44,319 --> 02:09:46,440
[SPEAKER_02]: How many hours have you spent on your archaeology?

1837
02:09:48,621 --> 02:09:49,241
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1838
02:09:49,281 --> 02:09:50,262
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been that long.

1839
02:09:50,722 --> 02:09:52,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, I spent...

1840
02:09:53,522 --> 02:09:56,463
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1841
02:10:16,351 --> 02:10:17,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Deathwing showed up while I was doing archaeology.

1842
02:10:45,526 --> 02:10:45,786
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1843
02:10:46,487 --> 02:10:48,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you survive or did you actually die?

1844
02:10:48,328 --> 02:10:49,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually survived.

1845
02:10:49,769 --> 02:10:56,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to turn this into the WoW show, but I actually survived because what I did, I flew through the fire instead of getting on the ground.

1846
02:10:56,875 --> 02:10:58,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The timing or something worked out.

1847
02:10:58,076 --> 02:10:59,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the achievement and didn't die.

1848
02:11:00,928 --> 02:11:05,052
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, she was in Ratchet and she actually lived with like one hit point or something.

1849
02:11:05,072 --> 02:11:06,954
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird, but she couldn't believe it.

1850
02:11:06,974 --> 02:11:09,137
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, yeah, I actually got an achievement, but yet I lived.

1851
02:11:09,217 --> 02:11:12,220
[SPEAKER_01]: And she took an awesome screenshot of the town.

1852
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:14,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just totally engulfed in flames everywhere.

1853
02:11:14,682 --> 02:11:19,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you couldn't even really tell it was that for a bit because of the flames in the background.

1854
02:11:19,367 --> 02:11:20,969
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a really cool screenshot.

1855
02:11:21,389 --> 02:11:21,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1856
02:11:22,372 --> 02:11:26,515
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, I should let you go before the WoW haters come out and start saying, you guys talk too much WoW.

1857
02:11:26,655 --> 02:11:27,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much WoW on the show.

1858
02:11:27,415 --> 02:11:29,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And welcome to the guild, Jamie.

1859
02:11:29,477 --> 02:11:29,777
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1860
02:11:30,797 --> 02:11:31,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, X-Link.

1861
02:11:31,838 --> 02:11:32,939
[SPEAKER_02]: She's busy on her Tron pic.

1862
02:11:33,299 --> 02:11:33,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1863
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:34,960
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, no problem.

1864
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:35,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1865
02:11:37,122 --> 02:11:38,943
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, 1877gameOLR.

1866
02:11:38,963 --> 02:11:39,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you even hear that, DarkSarka?

1867
02:11:39,983 --> 02:11:40,964
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, welcome to the guild.

1868
02:11:41,124 --> 02:11:42,125
[SPEAKER_02]: She has a pet in her mouth right now.

1869
02:11:42,305 --> 02:11:43,906
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I heard, and thank you.

1870
02:11:44,967 --> 02:11:45,367
[SPEAKER_05]: See you, Rob?

1871
02:11:45,627 --> 02:11:46,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Season four?

1872
02:11:46,447 --> 02:11:48,129
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your little Tron-y looking headband.

1873
02:11:48,149 --> 02:11:48,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm working on the eyes.

1874
02:11:49,229 --> 02:11:49,970
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1875
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1876
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:56,783
[SPEAKER_02]: 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1877
02:11:56,863 --> 02:11:58,064
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got a call coming in right now.

1878
02:11:58,564 --> 02:11:59,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1879
02:11:59,765 --> 02:12:00,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1880
02:12:00,765 --> 02:12:02,586
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be Miss Jessica Harper.

1881
02:12:02,747 --> 02:12:03,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Jessica Harper.

1882
02:12:03,827 --> 02:12:04,327
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

1883
02:12:04,788 --> 02:12:05,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I am doing just fine.

1884
02:12:05,588 --> 02:12:06,249
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you guys doing?

1885
02:12:06,369 --> 02:12:06,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1886
02:12:06,849 --> 02:12:08,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So glad to have you back on the show.

1887
02:12:08,170 --> 02:12:09,590
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new?

1888
02:12:09,670 --> 02:12:11,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually came with an agenda tonight.

1889
02:12:11,712 --> 02:12:12,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

1890
02:12:13,381 --> 02:12:22,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that I believe you guys spoke about before as per my conversation with Jamie, but we have USOLR Madness.

1891
02:12:23,567 --> 02:12:29,951
[SPEAKER_04]: We are currently taking your top 25 lists, and unfortunately we haven't received as many as we would like.

1892
02:12:30,872 --> 02:12:31,452
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it is?

1893
02:12:31,492 --> 02:12:32,973
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a bunch of procrastinators.

1894
02:12:33,658 --> 02:12:34,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1895
02:12:34,598 --> 02:12:35,919
[SPEAKER_04]: But the deadline is coming up.

1896
02:12:36,299 --> 02:12:46,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And since USL will be on hiatus just based on how the holidays fall, since we have Christmas on a Saturday and then New Year's Eve on a Saturday.

1897
02:12:47,243 --> 02:12:47,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yikes, yeah.

1898
02:12:48,183 --> 02:12:48,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1899
02:12:49,123 --> 02:12:50,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of puts us in a little bit of a hiatus.

1900
02:12:50,864 --> 02:12:56,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought I'd come and be a pain in your ass and talk about it on your show instead.

1901
02:12:56,886 --> 02:12:58,907
[SPEAKER_02]: We think it's great what you guys do over there.

1902
02:12:59,307 --> 02:13:01,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Why USL OLR Madness?

1903
02:13:03,475 --> 02:13:19,160
[SPEAKER_04]: because it is the way that you, the gaming audience, can actually get your voice out there and be heard and show what the real games that people love are rather than those that are just being highly profitable because...

1904
02:13:20,202 --> 02:13:22,083
[SPEAKER_04]: People are spending way too much money on stupid shit.

1905
02:13:22,583 --> 02:13:28,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And it won't be rigged for Final Fantasy 7 like the GameFAQs contest for every year.

1906
02:13:28,365 --> 02:13:30,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year it's Final Fantasy 7 something.

1907
02:13:31,586 --> 02:13:32,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

1908
02:13:32,547 --> 02:13:35,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 7 could win.

1909
02:13:35,888 --> 02:13:41,270
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been in the top 16, but I don't believe it's won a Madness title yet.

1910
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:07,284
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody wants to get their top 25 list in and has not yet, just go ahead and formulate your top 25 list.

1911
02:14:07,725 --> 02:14:17,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Send it to uslmadness at gmail.com We will tack it on in with the rest of the votes and deadline is January 3rd.

1912
02:14:18,131 --> 02:14:21,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So get your votes in and we will be starting right after the holidays.

1913
02:14:22,668 --> 02:14:23,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Excited to see it.

1914
02:14:24,269 --> 02:14:31,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to pull up my list that I had actually sent to Brestle so I can give you a little taste of what I'm rooting for here.

1915
02:14:31,194 --> 02:14:33,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I'm trying to pull it up in my email archive here.

1916
02:14:34,016 --> 02:14:36,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I set my list on November 30th because I'm a very good boy.

1917
02:14:36,818 --> 02:14:37,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you're a good boy.

1918
02:14:38,739 --> 02:14:39,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you just a little taste.

1919
02:14:39,919 --> 02:14:43,400
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one game, of course, was Super Metroid.

1920
02:14:43,540 --> 02:14:44,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, duh.

1921
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,021
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the best game ever.

1922
02:14:46,381 --> 02:14:49,021
[SPEAKER_02]: My number two game this year was the Civilization series.

1923
02:14:49,421 --> 02:14:58,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I think between five out this year and four being so epic and the original being so awesome, I think Civ is deserving of a spot that high up.

1924
02:14:58,803 --> 02:15:01,284
[SPEAKER_02]: With five this year, I was just like, oh, this is all amazeballs.

1925
02:15:01,864 --> 02:15:02,844
[SPEAKER_02]: My number three game...

1926
02:15:03,664 --> 02:15:07,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, Metroidvania, Final Fantasy 6, Plants vs. Zombies

1927
02:15:26,213 --> 02:15:28,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe it'll make the top 64 then.

1928
02:15:28,335 --> 02:15:31,617
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the weird thing is that John has been keeping good track of things.

1929
02:15:32,217 --> 02:15:35,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It has not breached the top 25 recently.

1930
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:40,863
[SPEAKER_04]: During the initial voting, it was one of the top 25 and it did get pushed out.

1931
02:15:40,903 --> 02:15:42,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even in the bubble zone right now.

1932
02:15:42,624 --> 02:15:47,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you love Plants vs. Zombies, you better put it on your list.

1933
02:15:48,128 --> 02:15:53,031
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think Plants vs. Zombies is the greatest game ever made, you better hurry the hell up and get in there.

1934
02:15:53,471 --> 02:15:53,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1935
02:15:56,794 --> 02:15:57,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1936
02:15:57,294 --> 02:15:57,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what else?

1937
02:15:57,994 --> 02:15:59,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else going on in your world, Jessica?

1938
02:15:59,556 --> 02:16:00,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to share with us?

1939
02:16:01,177 --> 02:16:08,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got a new computer and I have a brand new video card that I'm ready to put into it, but it is a slim computer.

1940
02:16:08,682 --> 02:16:13,085
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I did get a low profile card, I do not have the proper brackets for it.

1941
02:16:13,225 --> 02:16:21,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm in a holding pattern once again and just waiting for my brackets so I can put my new video card in and actually start doing some decent PC gaming.

1942
02:16:22,012 --> 02:16:22,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1943
02:16:22,854 --> 02:16:24,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had something similar happen.

1944
02:16:24,196 --> 02:16:29,223
[SPEAKER_02]: When I bought a new video card, it was so Uber, it wouldn't fit in there with the power supply.

1945
02:16:29,703 --> 02:16:33,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to get a new power supply as well to make it all work.

1946
02:16:34,590 --> 02:16:39,897
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a very tight squeeze, and I'm not quite sure exactly how it's going to work, but I'll make it work, damn it.

1947
02:16:39,977 --> 02:16:40,437
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1948
02:16:40,477 --> 02:16:41,639
[SPEAKER_02]: So when are you signing up for WoW?

1949
02:16:42,019 --> 02:16:42,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

1950
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:43,060
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1951
02:16:43,220 --> 02:16:43,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

1952
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:44,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

1953
02:16:44,521 --> 02:16:49,025
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have a feeling that I might end up with Star Trek Online somewhere in my mailbox at some point.

1954
02:16:49,065 --> 02:16:49,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

1955
02:16:50,426 --> 02:16:53,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm thinking STO is going to be the game of choice.

1956
02:16:54,150 --> 02:16:55,351
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a 10-day trial, let me know.

1957
02:16:55,391 --> 02:16:56,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I may still have another card.

1958
02:16:56,412 --> 02:16:57,353
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's recruiting.

1959
02:16:58,233 --> 02:16:58,874
[SPEAKER_07]: We shall see.

1960
02:16:59,014 --> 02:16:59,535
[SPEAKER_04]: We shall see.

1961
02:16:59,895 --> 02:17:00,195
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1962
02:17:00,536 --> 02:17:00,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1963
02:17:00,856 --> 02:17:03,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Travis is a big fan of that, too.

1964
02:17:03,598 --> 02:17:04,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney.

1965
02:17:04,439 --> 02:17:04,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1966
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:06,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be surprised at all.

1967
02:17:06,801 --> 02:17:08,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well Jessica, good luck with the new PC.

1968
02:17:09,064 --> 02:17:12,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it brings you lots of gaming joy this holiday season.

1969
02:17:12,189 --> 02:17:15,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already brought me Plants vs. Zombies, so there you go.

1970
02:17:16,014 --> 02:17:18,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Best of luck with everything going on at Under Station Live.

1971
02:17:18,357 --> 02:17:21,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear about the bad timing of the holidays this year, but hey, enjoy the break.

1972
02:17:22,182 --> 02:17:22,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1973
02:17:23,023 --> 02:17:23,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, take care.

1974
02:17:24,084 --> 02:17:24,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night, guys.

1975
02:17:24,684 --> 02:17:24,904
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

1976

[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call We are taking some calls Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio

1977
02:17:53,220 --> 02:17:56,021

1978
02:18:21,826 --> 02:18:29,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's not get shadowed I already said my two cents about that in the chat room What's on your mind, buddy?

1979
02:18:29,932 --> 02:18:30,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Why'd you call?

1980
02:18:31,226 --> 02:18:39,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, to satisfy Breslow, I finally sent out my 25 because I realized I didn't play enough games this year to qualify.

1981
02:18:39,892 --> 02:18:46,357
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm sitting there for about an hour putting my list together and picking the brains of my roommates for what games did you like?

1982
02:18:46,517 --> 02:18:49,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, keep in mind, it's not the top 25 of this year.

1983
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:51,280
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the top 25 of all time.

1984
02:18:51,861 --> 02:18:54,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but still, I just feel like I don't really game enough for it.

1985
02:18:54,503 --> 02:18:56,424
[SPEAKER_11]: But I got my list together and I sent it out.

1986
02:18:56,824 --> 02:18:57,425
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, good boy.

1987
02:18:58,021 --> 02:19:00,003
[SPEAKER_11]: and I did put on there Final Fantasy 6.

1988
02:19:00,503 --> 02:19:01,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Good man.

1989
02:19:01,284 --> 02:19:02,565
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great Final Fantasy game.

1990
02:19:02,625 --> 02:19:06,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Final Fantasy 4 I sometimes call my favorite.

1991
02:19:06,969 --> 02:19:12,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it a little bit of a backseat which is funny because I sent that list in before the news about the PSP version.

1992
02:19:13,575 --> 02:19:18,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It will probably be back near the top of my list next year after I play the PSP version.

1993
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:20,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

1994
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:20,721
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1995
02:19:22,482 --> 02:19:23,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So, alright.

1996
02:19:23,243 --> 02:19:24,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what was at the top of your list?

1997
02:19:24,584 --> 02:19:25,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I be nosy?

1998
02:19:25,204 --> 02:19:26,004
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your number one game?

1999
02:19:26,185 --> 02:19:26,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever?

2000
02:19:27,165 --> 02:19:29,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the game.

2001
02:19:29,386 --> 02:19:29,667
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2002
02:19:29,747 --> 02:19:31,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Was your number one game of all time?

2003
02:19:32,649 --> 02:19:33,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved that game.

2004
02:19:34,490 --> 02:19:39,613
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the few games where I sat there and played it over and over and over.

2005
02:19:39,973 --> 02:19:42,975
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is one of those games where, yeah, tap the bank for the crack.

2006
02:19:43,095 --> 02:19:45,256
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what that game fell under for me.

2007
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:45,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2008
02:19:46,217 --> 02:19:49,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Where every gamer has a voice, even when those voices are insane.

2009
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:50,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

2010
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:50,980
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2011
02:19:52,589 --> 02:19:54,171
[SPEAKER_11]: I like River City Ransom, I mean, really.

2012
02:19:54,371 --> 02:19:55,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm giving you shit.

2013
02:19:55,252 --> 02:20:08,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm watching Loki in studios playing, I think the new version of Super Mario Crossover, like there was a brand new version that came out, but he is driving the Blaster Master car, and that made me think, oh man, Blaster Master should have been on my list.

2014
02:20:09,347 --> 02:20:10,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, what?

2015
02:20:10,508 --> 02:20:12,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Blaster Master is in Mario Crossover?

2016
02:20:12,650 --> 02:20:14,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they just added Sofia.

2017
02:20:14,311 --> 02:20:17,914
[SPEAKER_02]: The car from Blaster Master is now in Mario Crossover.

2018
02:20:18,875 --> 02:20:20,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I now have my reason to play the game.

2019
02:20:22,137 --> 02:20:25,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to tell my roommate and he's going to fangasm.

2020
02:20:26,821 --> 02:20:33,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I need somebody to send in a top 25 list that has Blaster Master near the top to make up for the fact that I left it off my list.

2021
02:20:33,164 --> 02:20:34,345
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, DarkSakura, it says she will.

2022
02:20:34,605 --> 02:20:35,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't sent my list in.

2023
02:20:36,145 --> 02:20:36,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good, good.

2024
02:20:36,966 --> 02:20:40,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some Blaster Master love because I forgot because I'm an idiot.

2025
02:20:40,488 --> 02:20:41,628
[SPEAKER_10]: When do we have to send those lists in?

2026
02:20:42,308 --> 02:20:46,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the third was the deadline, but you're procrastinating, but you should do it right now.

2027
02:20:49,272 --> 02:20:49,572
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2028
02:20:50,372 --> 02:20:51,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?

2029
02:20:52,355 --> 02:20:54,937
[SPEAKER_11]: The main reason why I called was I want to ask you guys this.

2030
02:20:55,577 --> 02:21:02,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think programmers purposely put code into games where you swear it cheats?

2031
02:21:04,375 --> 02:21:31,606
[SPEAKER_02]: um it depends on the type of game but like when you say games that cheat my mind automatically goes immediately goes to Super Mario Kart and the whole rubber banding and this is a very common thing you hear in racing games Mario Kart's not the only racing game that does it a lot of them do but yes that's basically programmed cheating is that if you are too far ahead of the other contestants they get to speed boost or whatever to catch up to you that's programmed to cheat to make it more exciting so

2032
02:21:31,966 --> 02:21:32,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2033
02:21:55,249 --> 02:21:57,950
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like his team of four growing up with a team of eight.

2034
02:21:57,970 --> 02:22:05,591
[SPEAKER_11]: As soon as he walks into the area, that whole team just slaughters him under 15 minutes and he's screaming repeatedly that the game is cheating.

2035
02:22:06,611 --> 02:22:08,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Me personally, I don't think the game cheats.

2036
02:22:08,731 --> 02:22:09,311
[SPEAKER_11]: You just suck.

2037
02:22:09,591 --> 02:22:16,153
[SPEAKER_02]: But that dates all the way back to the NES days when you would be playing a sports game or any type of game.

2038
02:22:16,473 --> 02:22:19,973
[SPEAKER_02]: RC Pro-Am was another racer that would just infuriate people.

2039
02:22:20,333 --> 02:22:22,054
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's fucking cheating, man.

2040
02:22:22,074 --> 02:22:23,214
[SPEAKER_02]: This game fucking cheats.

2041
02:22:23,234 --> 02:22:23,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2042
02:22:25,274 --> 02:22:33,138
[SPEAKER_11]: I can understand if they actually put in purpose code for cheating compared to where your skills aren't good enough, Padawan.

2043
02:22:33,238 --> 02:22:35,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's just ramping up the difficulty.

2044
02:22:35,139 --> 02:22:42,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind a lot of those NES, and if you want to go way back, Atari 2600 games, were set to loop over and over and over again.

2045
02:22:42,403 --> 02:22:49,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course the difficulty gets insane and harder than you're able to do at some point because that's just what it is.

2046
02:22:50,587 --> 02:22:51,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

2047
02:22:51,528 --> 02:22:53,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Or take a game like Civilization.

2048
02:22:54,188 --> 02:23:03,112
[SPEAKER_02]: and at its highest difficulty level, I believe the computer opponents can build resources like 1.4 times as fast as you can.

2049
02:23:03,632 --> 02:23:07,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to really think about how to use your resources.

2050
02:23:08,188 --> 02:23:27,485
[SPEAKER_02]: well I don't think that's really cheating the game is cheating per se that's just like advanced skill god mode it's like you know what you're getting yourself into when you walk into it yeah and if you can beat that then you're a fucking stud like you are but you know going into it okay I am playing an uphill battle here and if I beat this I'm awesome mhm

2051
02:23:29,530 --> 02:23:31,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's exactly what I was getting at.

2052
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:31,952
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2053
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:34,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ranma, we're going to let you go to try to get some more calls tonight.

2054
02:23:34,774 --> 02:23:35,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

02:23:35,134 --> 02:23:36,175
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you so much for your call.

[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2063
02:23:44,041 --> 02:23:44,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

2067

[SPEAKER_02]: We've got time for one more call if you want to give us a call.

2068
02:23:52,287 --> 02:23:52,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Decemberween Decemberween

[SPEAKER_02]: or Festivus, whatever it is that you celebrate.

[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or his username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2071
02:24:19,889 --> 02:24:22,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd usually be going around getting some last minute stories, but there aren't any.

2072
02:24:23,732 --> 02:24:24,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's read them all.

2073
02:24:25,132 --> 02:24:29,835
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's busy playing Super Mario Crossover and DarkSakura's working on her Tron art.

2074
02:24:30,596 --> 02:24:32,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am telling a monologue right now.

2075
02:24:35,729 --> 02:24:38,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for not participating.

2076
02:24:38,692 --> 02:24:39,232
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

2077
02:24:40,434 --> 02:24:41,434
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you plan to do with your time off?

2078
02:24:41,454 --> 02:24:42,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any time off from work, Loki?

2079
02:24:43,997 --> 02:24:45,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 3D weekends.

2080
02:24:45,298 --> 02:24:45,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

2081
02:24:45,498 --> 02:24:46,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to do anything special with them?

2082
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:47,720
[SPEAKER_02]: No, hang out.

2083
02:24:48,121 --> 02:24:49,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hang out, be with the baby?

2084
02:24:50,458 --> 02:24:51,939
[SPEAKER_02]: You taking the baby anywhere for the holidays?

2085
02:24:52,119 --> 02:24:53,460
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom's.

2086
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:55,320
[SPEAKER_02]: But your mom's here are kind of local, right?

2087
02:24:55,340 --> 02:24:57,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you're having to go to the snow or anything?

2088
02:24:57,061 --> 02:24:59,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, she's very close.

2089
02:25:00,843 --> 02:25:07,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone in our chat room named Hi, I love that name, is saying a new Gorillaz album on Christmas, the fall.

2090
02:25:07,907 --> 02:25:09,788
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you're the big Gorillaz fan, girl.

2091
02:25:09,828 --> 02:25:10,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I'm looking forward to it.

2092
02:25:11,268 --> 02:25:11,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2093
02:25:12,629 --> 02:25:15,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a whole new album for sale?

2094
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:16,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I think like an EP.

2095
02:25:17,191 --> 02:25:17,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

2096
02:25:18,072 --> 02:25:18,452
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

2097
02:25:19,491 --> 02:25:19,751
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2098
02:25:20,392 --> 02:25:23,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the phone's not ringing, so I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2099
02:25:24,016 --> 02:25:33,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for those of you that did call, and if you didn't get through tonight but you wanted to, well, you had a chance, but you can always leave us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2100
02:25:33,666 --> 02:25:36,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the night.

2101
02:25:36,269 --> 02:25:37,510
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2102
02:25:37,530 --> 02:25:38,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron.

2103
02:25:38,992 --> 02:25:40,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2104
02:25:42,575 --> 02:25:44,856
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is this game is pretty hard.

2105
02:25:45,476 --> 02:25:46,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I blew up, damn it.

2106
02:25:47,537 --> 02:25:50,118
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought of the night is this show is done early enough.

2107
02:25:50,498 --> 02:25:51,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have time for Pinkberry.

2108
02:25:52,919 --> 02:25:54,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was a short show tonight, but that's okay.

2109
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:56,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a wonderful holiday, everybody.

2110
02:25:56,760 --> 02:26:05,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we will not be here next week, but we will be back in 2011 for the ninth year of Orange Lounge Radio.

2111
02:26:05,284 --> 02:26:05,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

2112
02:26:06,269 --> 02:26:06,930
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next year.

2113
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:14,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great Christmas or whatever it is you celebrate over these next couple weeks and have a wonderful and safe New Year's Eve.

2114
02:26:14,735 --> 02:26:15,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be stupid, people.

2115
02:26:16,236 --> 02:26:19,418
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend about the show.

2116
02:26:19,458 --> 02:26:20,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread the word.

02:26:20,539 --> 02:26:25,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We also love reviews on iTunes or any resource where you can grab a podcast.

2118
02:26:25,382 --> 02:26:26,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread the word.

2119
02:26:26,583 --> 02:26:28,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Share the love of independent podcasting.

2120
02:26:28,824 --> 02:26:29,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Be safe.

2121
