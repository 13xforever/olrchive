1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Alright, welcome back everybody to Rob Roberts and Cals here on the Orange Moms Radio feed.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,480
It's our E3 wrap up show.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,960
The final day, yes sadly E3 2010 is all done.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,720
And today we're not coming to you from a hotel room.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,920
Actually right now we are in the parking lot of In-N-Out Burger where I've taken the one

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,520
and only Bobby Blackwolf to his first In-N-Out experience.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,360
And Bobby, hyped.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Too much, not enough.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,260
What did you think of In-N-Out?

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,920
It was a burger.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,080
It's better than Wendy's and McDonald's and stuff but I'm, you know, being from the east

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,560
coast I'm partial to five guys myself.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,800
I was expecting him to go, mmm that is a tasty burger.

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,200
He did a little bit, he did have a little bit of that I gotta say.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,640
Alright, there's your Orange Lounge Foodio for those of you guys that have had your withdrawals

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
during the week.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,880
We will be back of course Sunday to do the E3 wrap up with Dark Sakura and Loki.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,840
That'll all be Sunday night at All Games Radio, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,300
But I really do urge you to tune in to the Bobby Blackwolf show who's right beforehand

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,780
at 5 Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,720
I don't know if that gets picked up on the mic but there was literally a plane flying

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
over us just now.

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,720
We're right by the airport to take Bobby over to the airport.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,440
We'll give you a quick little preview though of what's coming up on Bobby's show because

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,200
we wanted to start the recording today before Bobby had to get on a plane and go and kind

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,640
of ask Bobby, you know, what did you think of your final day?

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,400
What kind of stuff did you see and what were your impressions on some of the games, Bobby?

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Okay, so Rock Band 3.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,360
That blew me away.

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
All the stuff that they added.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,480
I didn't realize how much they added.

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,300
I know you guys covered it already so I'm not really going to add to it right now but

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,160
I will say one of the things I was able to, I played the keyboard and I played pro mode

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,820
on medium, which basically means that they add, you have two notes at a time.

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,080
So two note chords and everything and one thing that they don't tell a lot of people

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,360
and one thing that you don't realize is that they actually do have bumps on the keys to

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,640
denote where the color changes so you don't have to look at the keyboard when they shift

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,360
because you can actually feel where the colors are.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,200
So I thought that was, that's like one little tiny thing, they don't really mention it,

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,280
they don't say it but that adds a lot.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,920
So there was that and I also did an interview and it's going to be on E3coverage.com and

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,800
I actually stumped the guy about the MIDI port because the Guitar Hero drum set has

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,320
a MIDI input, kind of like what they're saying but it's not going to work for the pro mode.

44
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,880
You could use it for the basic but you're not going to be able to use it in the pro

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,600
modes of anything.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,720
So that was interesting and they are considering, it's right on the line of the Rock Band Stagekit

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,080
for all five of us that have it, having Rock Band Stagekit access.

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,360
So there you go, Rock Band 3, I was very impressed with it.

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,520
Portal 2 is hilarious.

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:09,240
I got to sit in on the 15 minute demo of that and they have kept the humor, they are talking

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,080
to Jonathan Coulton, he admitted that to me, they are talking to him, asking him who he

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,240
wants to work with to do it so he is definitely going to be a part of it for the music side.

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,160
But they've kept the humor and the gameplay elements they've added with the liquids where

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,120
you can either jump or slide really fast and some of the other objects that they've introduced

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,600
really look like it's going to be a great title, it's going to be a stand alone title

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,240
and so I'm really looking forward to that.

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:47,160
One thing non-gaming that I saw today that probably won't interest the OLR audience as

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,300
much but it's more of a glimpse of what they can do in the future is I actually got a behind

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,720
the scenes demo of Kinect with the dashboard.

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,740
So showing the video chat and stuff where the Kinect camera seamlessly will zoom in

61
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,960
and out based on who's in the frame.

62
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,300
So like if you're sitting on the couch alone it will be zoomed in on you, if somebody sits

63
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,360
next to you on the couch it will automatically zoom out and put them in the picture, take

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,700
the two of you into the picture and stuff like that, if that's the kind of thing you'd

65
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,160
like to use.

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:26,820
But really, ESPN integration, it's not just watching ESPN3, which ESPN3 is their online

67
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,720
internet because ESPN doesn't...

68
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,900
The Ocho!

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,480
It's like the Ocho.

70
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,760
Basically it's all the stuff that they have regionally that err on like regional stuff

71
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,480
but not good enough for the national.

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,440
So you can watch anything online like college football, like if it's an out-of-market team

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,480
for you or if it's like a very small school or something, they probably still have it

74
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,080
on ESPN3.

75
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,680
And you don't just watch it, they actually ask you who you're rooting for and it actually

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
keeps track...

77
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
And here comes another plane.

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
The plane!

79
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
The plane!

80
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
The plane!

81
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
The plane!

82
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
So it actually keeps track.

83
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,860
They showed us USC versus Ohio State, you're gonna watch that college football game.

84
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,040
The first thing they ask you is, who are you rooting for?

85
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,040
And then it tells you how many people, percentages of people watching that on Xbox Live are rooting

86
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,160
for that team and then it'll do trivia questions if you want that feature on and you're competing

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,600
against the other fans while you're watching the game.

88
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,960
And just stuff like that, if they integrated that into ESPN, maybe other things, they would

89
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,880
be able to integrate that same thing.

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,400
Do you think maybe for like, you know, women and the gays, as they say, we could get the

91
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,000
Oscars in the same type of situation?

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,760
Although I'm so over the Oscars, personally.

93
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,200
I think that would be awesome where they would, you know, have people guess who might win

94
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,760
and stuff and who would get the award.

95
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Who wore it best!

96
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Who wore...

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Yeah, and things like that.

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,240
So, you know, there's very good opportunity there for that and I was very impressed with

99
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,600
that and I got to use a little bit on the dashboard and stuff and it's gonna...

100
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,580
You still have to take very slow, deliberate movements.

101
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,160
You're not at the Minority Report level yet.

102
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,520
You can't just flick around or something because you'll wind up hitting something you don't

103
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,560
want to hit.

104
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,440
They were taking very deliberate movements to do it.

105
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
But I'm very...

106
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I'm excited.

107
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,160
I'm one of the few people excited for Kinect for all, you know, for just the dashboard.

108
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,860
Can I actually go back a little bit and talk about the video chat real quick?

109
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,640
Because you know, obviously the...

110
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,320
Not the iToy, the Xbox Vision that we had before, you know, kind of had the video chat.

111
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,840
And you know, I realize this is way upgraded, you know, better quality, it can zoom in and

112
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
out and all this stuff.

113
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
But you know, one thing I found about the video chat is that I rarely used it because

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,240
it's kind of, you know, it's not like a cell phone where a cell phone is always on you

115
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,800
and you pick it up, hit a button, you're good to go.

116
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,000
You know, I would think with a video chat, you both have to be on the 360 and then you

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
have to, you know, kind of want to Kinect and so forth.

118
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
You know, I don't know.

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I see...

120
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,440
It's like I get iPhone video chat, you know, if they ever get it on 3G.

121
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,400
But you know, I kind of sit here going, okay, that sounds cool, but am I ever really going

122
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,080
to use Kinect video chat except the one time to say I did?

123
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,680
You might not.

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Families might.

125
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,520
Now realize it's not just 360 to 360.

126
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,840
It's going to be with Windows Live Messenger, not at...

127
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,720
And I believe they even said right at launch.

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,800
So you'll be able to talk to somebody if they have Windows Live Messenger on their computer

129
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,800
and a webcam, they will be able... you will be able to talk to them.

130
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,920
Okay, now that's a big thing I wasn't considering before.

131
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,900
I could see that now then maybe like, you know, college kids trying to talk to parents

132
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,800
or grandmas that are, you know, getting internet enabled in this day and age.

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
That makes a lot more sense.

134
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,920
And they also have Bing integrated with it where you could actually select...

135
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
We're going to wait for the plane.

136
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
The plane!

137
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
The plane!

138
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
There we go.

139
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
There goes the plane.

140
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,440
So you can actually select like top videos of like, you know, entertainment stuff and

141
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,160
you can both watch it at the same time.

142
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,200
They call them conversation starters.

143
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
So if you don't know what to talk about, somebody can select this video and it pops up in the

144
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,000
center and so you're on each side and you can talk about that video.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I can see it now us doing an entire episode of Orange Lounge Radio just of the Bing topic

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
selections.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,680
Oh my god, what an amazing podcast that would be.

148
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,000
Just the Bing video chat podcast.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,280
Come on you guys, you know there's somebody...

150
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,440
Patent pending.

151
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
It's mine.

152
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Don't take it.

153
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,000
I will sue you.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We could do it together.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hey, there you go.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,520
I could do it at my place, you could do it at yours.

157
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
We'll record...

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
I've got the capture equipment.

159
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Awesome.

160
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,440
And we could make it a video podcast.

161
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,760
There we go.

162
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,840
One other game I played which was actually a music based game, Power Gig.

163
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,920
I actually played this.

164
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,240
Now this is the game and somebody even asked me about it I think on my Sunday night show

165
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
last week.

166
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
They'd be like, what do you think of Power Gig?

167
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,560
I'm like, well if it teaches you how to play guitar, it'll be great.

168
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,760
This one doesn't.

169
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,440
It uses a real guitar, it looks like a real guitar, feels like a real guitar, but it's

170
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,520
really still the same as Rock Band.

171
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,320
And they actually, I didn't realize they had a drum peripheral.

172
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,300
The drum peripheral is air drums.

173
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,920
It's like, and since this is your crowd I can say this and they'll get it, it's like

174
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,680
Power Power Paradise.

175
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:25,480
So you have drumsticks with sensors in them that break the plane of the pads, of the sensors

176
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,500
shooting, or the lasers shooting up or whatever.

177
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,220
And basically there's four floor sensors that I guess are sending lasers upwards and the

178
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,960
drumstick is sensing them and that's how it does, that's how it determines which one you're

179
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
hitting.

180
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,240
You have a bass drum pedal that sits on to the right and then you have a button, you

181
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,440
have a pedal for your left foot that activates what they're using for star power.

182
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,560
But basically you have to hold the sticks a very specific way, which is not the way

183
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,380
I normally hold sticks.

184
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,080
You have to have your thumb up because they have a little thumb groove in the drumstick

185
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,880
and it has to be up and I don't play that way.

186
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,320
I play, for any music geeks out there, I play matched grip, like you would in marching band.

187
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
That's how I play drum sets.

188
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,920
I don't really do the thumb up grip, which is called French grip.

189
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,160
See I'm a nerd, band nerd.

190
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,400
But a lot of drum set players do, so that's why they do it that way.

191
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,680
But you have to do it that way.

192
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,220
Because if the sensor's not going down it's not going to register.

193
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,600
And I was having a problem getting one of the pads, the hi-hat pad to register at all.

194
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,120
It wasn't registering most of the time, so it was not a very fun experience.

195
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,440
But they said it was still beta hardware and it's not the final version.

196
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Can I just say though, and kind of go back a little bit again, since you invoked the

197
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,960
name Para Para, something that kind of occurred to me today on the floor, maybe last night

198
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,920
after we taped, I don't know, but I realize I'm kind of, this E3 is really making me eat

199
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,760
a fat slice of humble pie because for years, literally years on this program, I've kind

200
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,420
of sat here and said, just give up, Para Para Paradise is never coming out in the US, so

201
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,440
you're not going to get it, it's not happening, people aren't going to get it here, so shut

202
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,960
up already, it's not going to come out here.

203
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,320
Enjoy its cultness and the fact that it's a very niche thing, embrace it, have fun with

204
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
it.

205
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Boy did I get proved wrong.

206
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,760
It's the most interesting thing to happen, but I swear you guys, Dance Masters is, it's

207
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
Para Para Paradise.

208
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,600
I mean, if you do the Night of Fire thing, it's the same thing.

209
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,840
They found a way to kind of get away with it here.

210
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,480
Now granted, it's not exactly that, but that's as close, now I will say this, and I will

211
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,960
know I'm right, I will know I'm right, take it or leave it because this is the closest

212
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,960
you're ever going to get for those that are Para Para Paradise fans, which I know we have

213
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,400
some of those in the show, as years old as that is, the camera thing will be pretty cool

214
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
I think.

215
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,120
The game itself looks neat, but very interesting head to head that's going to happen with the

216
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,080
Harmonix game too, anyway, I don't mean to go back to old topics, but anything else you

217
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
want to talk about?

218
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Bobby?

219
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,880
I'm trying to think, I did get to play Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, and for those that, I'm just

220
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,960
going to, I'm not really going to talk that much about the game, because I only played

221
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,480
it really once or twice, and it was button mashing and I lost, so I lost to Justin, the

222
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,680
editor, the other guy that does E3 coverage, who was not happy.

223
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,720
I beat him in dancing though, so I'm a better dancer.

224
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,920
But I will say that in the interview with E3coverage.com that I did, I did invoke Curly

225
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,520
Mustaches and Pringles and the Knicks.

226
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,160
So if you're a fan, I invoke all of those in that interview.

227
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:48,320
But I played, let's see, I don't even, I played Wii Party, because it was a short line, and

228
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,320
played the board game, which is kind of like Mario Party without the coins.

229
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,040
Played that for a little bit.

230
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,800
And it was kind of interesting, basically the mini games are to determine the roll order.

231
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,960
So that's just one of the many things in Wii Party.

232
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,280
It could be, I'm going to rent it at least.

233
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,880
And let's see, now I'm just stalling, because I'm trying to think if there was anything

234
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,840
else that I saw.

235
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,400
I don't think so, I'm in a Portal 2, hilarious.

236
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,040
On Live, I didn't realize that On Live is live now.

237
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,560
Like it went live probably about an hour ago, 6 PM Pacific is when they said it's going

238
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,120
live for everybody.

239
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,040
And I think if you're a founding member, you get one year free of On Live for the PC.

240
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,840
And it worked on the show floor.

241
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,040
They claimed that the server was up in Silicon Valley.

242
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,640
I don't know if I believe them, but if it's free for a year, I might as well, I might

243
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,040
check it out and see it on my own home connection.

244
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,620
This is going to be huge for MacGamers, which I know is kind of an oxymoron, but no, I'm

245
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,840
just kidding guys.

246
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,720
The MacGamers, I mean, getting to kind of do all this streaming, this is going to open

247
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,640
up a huge door, I think.

248
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,940
I would think that's where On Live is going to be most successful, but just watching it

249
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,600
on the floor, I didn't get the extensive demo you did, but I was like, is this for real?

250
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,200
Because it does look pretty smooth and pretty nice.

251
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,920
It's kind of one of those things that, you know on the show floor, everybody's putting

252
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,080
on their nicest front.

253
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,520
So I kind of wouldn't mind trying it on my home computer and see if it runs as well.

254
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,640
Bobby, I know we're going to wrap up, get you to your flight and all that stuff.

255
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,920
And if people want to hear more, they can tune into your Sunday night show or the one

256
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,480
I always forget to plug because we're not on right after it, but it's also a great show.

257
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,400
The effing show, the fnglive.net, which is a video show that you guys do.

258
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,080
You're actually doing one Friday night, which really, by the time most people hear this,

259
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,320
knowing what time I'm getting home tonight, it'll probably be tonight by the time most

260
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,920
people hear this.

261
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,320
So tune into that as well at, I believe, 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern once again.

262
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,820
So check that out.

263
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,760
One last question for Bobby though.

264
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,480
One of the thing that surprised you most about, and you've been to a lot of E3s, you've been

265
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,960
to about three times as many of them as I have.

266
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Thing that surprised you most about E3 2010, Bobby?

267
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:06,280
Oh God, you're putting me on the spot here.

268
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,160
It's kind of hard to say because I didn't see all that much because of the appointments

269
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
and stuff.

270
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,320
And you know, with Microsoft, it was all interviews.

271
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,080
Like I never touched a game in the Microsoft booth and stuff.

272
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,720
Maybe it was what surprised me had nothing to do with anything on the show floor, although

273
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,840
the game that shocked me was Driver San Francisco.

274
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,620
I didn't realize that would be that good.

275
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,840
But that could also be a good demo just like a split second.

276
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:42,120
But it's more that I need to find a way to balance appointments and then having free

277
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,720
time to go roam.

278
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,320
I literally only had about two and a half hours the entire week that didn't have appointments

279
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,160
that I could actually roam the show floor.

280
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Fourth day.

281
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Yes.

282
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
I could use a fourth day.

283
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,800
I know everybody that works E3 is like, oh God, no, I don't want a fourth day.

284
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
I don't.

285
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Oh my God.

286
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,560
But everybody could fill up a fourth day of appointments too.

287
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,240
So it's, you know, it seems it's too short.

288
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,680
But when I wasn't media and I was just showing up as, you know, exhibits only attendee as

289
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,680
a developer, I was usually bored by the middle of day two.

290
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,440
And I, you know, finish up, you know, Rock Band was my last thing that I saw.

291
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,760
You know, and I'm like, I could go another day.

292
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
You know, I'm not done yet.

293
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
I haven't.

294
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
I mean, I'm sure there's going to be something I'm going to miss and I'm going to kick myself

295
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
for missing it.

296
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,280
Like, you know, Civ V. But yeah, I'm, I need more time.

297
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,920
I think that was the surprise is that I need more time.

298
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
All right.

299
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Good answer.

300
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I was totally putting you on the spot.

301
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,180
That was a good answer.

302
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,240
So thank you so much, Bobby.

303
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,560
And we'll talk as always on Sunday night.

304
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,960
Now, of course, Shane and I are still going to talk some games too, but we're going to

305
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,240
go drop Bobby off at the airport.

306
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,360
So we'll just do a little break here in the podcast-a-roo and we'll be back sometime after

307
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,780
the grapevine on i5.

308
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,120
So stay tuned.

309
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Okay.

310
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,720
So we're back for the second half, although I'm kind of a terrible liar and it's almost

311
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,520
24 hours after we did that first half.

312
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,840
But we decided doing a podcast while trying to drive probably wasn't the best of ideas,

313
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,000
as boring as i5 is.

314
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,600
So yeah, we took the safe route and came home and then of course we were really tired and

315
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,280
that's stuff we want to do today, but we still wanted to at least wrap up some of the stuff

316
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,360
we saw on E3 day three while it's still fresh in our minds, although I find that I'm on

317
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
like game overload.

318
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
I played so much.

319
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,320
And I've been playing games since I got home because Shane's like, you got to play Alan

320
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Wake.

321
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,320
And I have been, and it's been scary and all that, but I'll talk more about that on Sunday

322
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
show.

323
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,160
But anyway, um, while Shane is still here in California, we want to, um, at least kind

324
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,600
of go through some of the games we saw at E3 day three.

325
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,760
And then of course we'll resume, um, you know, with all the rest of the news on Sunday night

326
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
show.

327
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,440
So say hello to Shane, everybody who is back with us here on this, uh, Rob Robertson pals

328
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,880
Thursday kind of Friday edition.

329
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,200
It's actually been over 24 hours since we were supposed to do it because it's now almost

330
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,960
11 here and we stopped at like seven yesterday, but hi.

331
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,320
You know, through the magic of radio, people would have never known, but that's all right.

332
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,280
All right, Shane, let's get to the games.

333
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,000
Give us some games that you want to talk about.

334
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
All right.

335
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,800
I actually wrote these all down in a random order, so I'll go in a random order.

336
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,360
Um, no, I won't.

337
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
Castlevania Lords of Shadow.

338
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,480
It's the new Castlevania game coming out for the 360 and the PS3.

339
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,640
Um, pretty much a God of War style game.

340
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,240
The demo definitely made me want to play more of it, um, cause it had some interesting features

341
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,880
like there's a part where you're on mounted combat and when you get knocked off, because

342
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,680
I'm terrible at it, you have to fight through enemies before your little sparkle horse comes

343
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,920
back so you can start writing again.

344
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,720
Um, very graphically pretty, uh, kind of reminded me of like looking at a painting.

345
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,560
Um, so had some slow down issues, but it's okay, I liked it.

346
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,280
Yeah, I'm hoping some of the frame rate issues was just because it's still a beta and you

347
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,360
know, some of these things are really hard to judge from, um, early demo builds.

348
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,880
But um, I, the only thing that kind of got me about the game was that I think, you know,

349
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,600
a lot of people who weren't happy with the direction Castlevania took in the like PS1

350
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:22,240
and PS2 versions are, um, going to be, um, you know, really disappointed, I think by

351
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,680
what they're doing here because it didn't really feel like a Castlevania game to me.

352
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,800
In fact, if I remember right, I read somewhere that this game originally started as a totally

353
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,120
different game and then they kind of, I guess retconned the Castlevania thing into it.

354
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
Now it's not a, it was not a bad game by any means.

355
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,000
I actually thought it was really cool and pretty and, and, um, enjoyable, but I think

356
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,280
some people that were expecting the old style, you know, whipping Castlevania games are going

357
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,360
to be in for a surprise cause Shane's right, it plays a lot more like God of War, kind

358
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,720
of Bayonetta, it felt like a little bit to me too, um, with some of the cut scenes.

359
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,240
But again, very pretty and I still think, um, probably going to be worth your time checking

360
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
out when it comes out.

361
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,500
Um, now if you do want kind of that old school 2D experience, I got a little time with the

362
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,760
arcade, um, game, which is the, uh, what, Harmony of Despair, Castlevania game, which

363
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,640
I think we had talked about a little bit the day before, but I actually hands on played

364
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,560
it, um, on the last day of E3 and I enjoyed it.

365
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,920
Shane, I don't think, uh, felt so favorably about it, um, but I kind of liked the whole

366
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,160
Neo Geo effect of the zoom in and out, like if you ever played the fighting games on Neo

367
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,560
Geo, how it kind of like zooms way in and out and stuff on the action, you can kind

368
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,520
of control that in the Castlevania game, um, and it was very, um, you know, inspired by

369
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,940
Symphony of the Night, which I thought was cool, um, so it's basically a race from start

370
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,120
to finish, you have like 10 minutes to kind of get through the castle and I know the demo

371
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,540
castle I played was kind of hard cause it seemed like there really was only one path

372
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,840
through the castle, but I couldn't figure it out.

373
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,280
Um, unfortunately the demo on the floor didn't give a lot of exposition as to what all the

374
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,120
features were and the people at least where I was at, I played it at Microsoft's booth

375
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,360
and I don't think the people there were as on the up and up on, you know, what the game

376
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,960
was all about, so, unfortunately, um, I was a little bit kind of like lost I guess as

377
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,560
to all the features, but you know, I enjoyed what I played, um, and you know, I'm pretty

378
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,280
sure the arcade game will probably cost $10, maybe $15 and it'll probably be worth it,

379
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,940
I will probably pay it at least to check out the full version, if not at least the trial

380
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,940
for heaven's sake.

381
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:22,320
Uh, Fable 3 was another game I checked out at Microsoft's booth and Fable 3, um, again

382
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,520
the demo didn't really give you a lot, at least for me, of like what is really different

383
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,820
about the game from Fable 2, I noticed a lot of, you know, the gold trail was kind of back

384
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,040
from the other Fable games and the difference I saw was that you could dress up in a giant

385
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,760
chicken suit for one of the quests, um, but you know, they weren't running it on Kinect

386
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,200
or whatever, because right, Fable 3 is supposed to have some Kinect stuff, supposedly, but

387
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,680
they weren't really showing any of that on the floor, so I gotta be honest, I didn't

388
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,800
see a whole lot that was really different from Fable 2 and most of the people I talked

389
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,640
to, same thing, but, I mean, that's not really a bad thing, Fable 2 was a great game, it

390
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,120
was one of the better games that came out that year, it came out, so, more of the same

391
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,440
in this case, not necessarily a bad thing, um, and I'm sure there's some other stuff

392
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,680
I, like, you know, it seemed to be like there was a couple more interactions and things

393
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,840
you could choose from, so, I mean, that part of it's cool, so, that was pretty much my

394
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,960
impressions of Fable 3, I'll check that out when it comes out too.

395
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,240
So while Rob was playing Fable 3, I was just around the corner, uh, playing Crackdown 2,

396
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,200
and seriously, it was just Crackdown, that's all it was, and it was a 30 minute demo, which,

397
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
um, I actually didn't spend the whole 30 minutes playing, but I definitely could have, um,

398
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,820
easily, it was still fun, it was hilarious, um, and there were agility orbs, and that's

399
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,880
all you need in a Crackdown game, um, I didn't play a whole lot of the first game, um, so

400
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,420
this might be a new feature, but you can capture points, and then call helicopters down to

401
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,960
give you more weapons, and the more proficient you are with, like, guns, the better weapons

402
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:01,440
you get, so, uh, it actually really made me want to get one of those sleek new 360s, um,

403
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,200
so I was happy with it, uh, and I guess it comes out in a couple months, or next month.

404
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,000
What's wrong with the old 360s? Why can't you just get one of the old 360s? They aren't

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,160
the shiny new ones, um, plus, I would like to have a wireless adapter, um, and this one's

406
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,040
built in instead of paying an extra hundred dollars. Dollars? Dollars. So in other words,

407
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,360
what they really should have had the first time. Yes, and if it breaks, it can't red

408
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,040
ring technically, because there are no red lights inside, so if it breaks, it's gonna

409
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,920
be three green rings of death. Or hopefully they've just built it this time, so it doesn't

410
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,860
break, but that's another issue altogether, I'm digressing a little bit. So, what is next

411
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,400
on our list? Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Um, you know, the demo was limited, it only had about,

412
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,880
what, eight, ten characters, I don't remember, but that one, I mean, I guess that's still

413
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,680
a lot, ten characters was as many as they had in the, like, original Street Fighter,

414
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,200
right? No, the original Street Fighter was just eight. Anyway, um, it was cool, it was,

415
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,960
um, very stylistic, um, you know, as a lot of you guys have seen in the trailers. To

416
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,640
me it plays just like Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Keep in mind, I'm not on my up and up on fighting

417
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,560
games, so I'm not the best authority to talk about these types of games, but to me it played

418
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,320
a lot like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but definitely had that more, like, kinda like Cell style

419
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,360
that you've seen in a lot of the commercials. Not as much of the 2D, 3D switching as I would

420
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,440
have thought based on the trailer and the fact that it kinda was supposed to be a little

421
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,400
more Street Fighter IV, I thought. Um, so graphically, you know, it's kinda like a souped

422
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,600
up arcade release, but I think it's gonna be, uh, pleasing for the fans. And some of

423
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,400
the supers do the 3D thing a little bit, at least it was in the demo, but again, early,

424
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,400
early, early build, and then, uh, had huge lines going for it all day at the Capcom booth.

425
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
Um, the trick to getting to play the game quickly was to go to Microsoft's booth or

426
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,880
even Sony's booth and play the game there, which is what we did.

427
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,280
I really liked it. Um, I'm not a huge fan of the Marvel vs. Capcom games, or I already

428
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,560
like Capcom vs. SNK, but, um, the one thing I noticed about it is because of the size

429
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:11,160
of the characters and the screen, um, amount that you have to play in, it felt like the

430
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,320
game was going a little too fast compared to the other ones. Um, sometimes it was kinda

431
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,800
hard to keep up with what was going on. And, um, as a button masher, cause I don't know

432
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,000
how to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and I picked, I think all new characters except for Iron

433
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,840
Man, um, Chris Redfield sucks. Like, utterly, utterly terrible character. Um, slow and just

434
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,880
awful. But Dante was really cool. I will definitely, when I play this game, will be playing as

435
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
Dante.

436
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,160
Awesome. Yeah, I pretty much played with standard characters. Felicia, Morgan, Ryu, all that

437
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,800
fun stuff. Alright, so I finally, um, made good on my promise to get some hands-on with

438
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,800
the PlayStation Move. Unfortunately, the line to get to all the really good games was really

439
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,200
long. Um, but some of the, like, littler games that didn't have quite the, you know, like

440
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,880
the bowling game and some other stuff, didn't have quite the long lines to get to them.

441
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,400
So the game I got to play was the Toy Story game, which, you know, it's not a bad game.

442
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,680
There's certainly an audience for it. It's definitely directed at a younger audience.

443
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,640
It plays a lot like the Midway Mania game that came out earlier on the Wii. Um, but

444
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,880
it's Toy Story 3, I should point out. It's, I guess, a game for Toy Story 3. But it pretty

445
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,200
much plays just like Midway Mania, the ride, or the, um, other game that came out on the

446
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,120
Wii. Um, you know, it's more of a point the move at the screen. It doesn't even use the

447
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,280
second controller. It's just the one stick and you just kind of aim it at the screen

448
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,680
and shoot. Very logical. But, you know, I was able to at least kind of get my hands

449
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,280
on it. I like the way that controller kind of felt to hold. Um, it is a little weird

450
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,860
with the whole, like, lollipop look that it has. And it's kind of funny because, um, when

451
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,080
you shoot, uh, a certain square in the Toy Story game, it'll activate rapid fire. So

452
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,840
you just hold that on the button to shoot, you know, the balls everywhere at the targets.

453
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,320
But your little, uh, ball on the top of your controller starts spazzing out and turning

454
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,000
all these rainbow colors. It's all pretty. So, you know, kids will get a kick out of

455
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,040
it if you have one of those households where, you know, mom and dad really like to play

456
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,560
their more hardcore PlayStation games, but you want some stuff for the kids too. I think

457
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,880
that's going to fit in very nicely with the collection. Or if you're, you know, a Disney

458
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,840
nut or you really like Midway Mania. Um, it was, it was cute. Although I didn't, I gotta

459
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,480
be honest, I was talking to the demo guy about a bunch of like other things besides just

460
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,280
the game. Um, so I couldn't tell you like how extensive the game's going to be, but

461
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,640
you know what? It's, it's a Toy Story game. It's, you know what you're going to get.

462
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,520
I am, on the other hand, um, when I got to play the move, I went to a more, I don't know,

463
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,200
real game and I ended up playing Time Crisis, the new one. I don't remember the subtitle.

464
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,760
Oh well. Um, it was great. Uh, the move controller works really well for Time Crisis. Uh, it's

465
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,800
very, very quick in response time when you move it around. I was getting headshots left

466
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,680
and right. Um, I had no problems playing it. In fact, I kind of played, I guess you could

467
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,520
consider it twice because I played with two different people next to me. I just didn't

468
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,280
want to leave and I always totally outdid the, the other people. Um, but I did talk

469
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,840
to the rep that was there and he told me that the game is not only going to have the on-rails

470
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,640
shooter like we all know from Time Crisis, but it will also have one, um, part of the

471
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,200
game where you can just move around and shoot things too. So you're not stuck to those rails.

472
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,680
And also he informed me that the retail copy will come with a move enhanced version of

473
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:36,520
Time Crisis 4. So you kind of get three games in one. Um, which is great because, uh, Time

474
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,560
Crisis 4, if it's free, it's good. I mean, it's a terrible, terrible Time Crisis game,

475
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,620
but this new one is really fun. So I'm excited. Um, one of the cool things real quick about

476
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,120
it was that the button on the top of the controller acted like your foot pedal in the arcade.

477
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,520
So you would, uh, release it when you want to reload and keep your, um, shield up and

478
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,720
then you would hold it down and then press the trigger button on the underside of the

479
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,160
controller when you'd want to fire. Now, if you take Time Crisis off the rails, though,

480
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,920
is it still really Time Crisis? I don't know. I can't see me playing that, uh, off the rails,

481
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,140
um, section of the game that much because it did sound like they were two completely

482
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:22,120
separate, uh, parts of the game. Like you can just play the rails game or you can play

483
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,240
the, uh, free roaming one. I don't know how the free roaming one will work and it'll require

484
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:34,600
for sure at least the, what, the Sony nunchuck, whatever it's called, um, to move around because

485
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,920
I don't think you can really move around with just the move controller. The navigation controller,

486
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,360
if I'm not mistaken, is what they call it. I like to call it, um, the, the, I think it

487
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,680
was like balancing rock from, uh, um, uh, WarioWare, uh, smooth moves because those

488
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:57,400
little intro things are hilarious. Um, and here's the microphone back. Alright, so we

489
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,040
went over to Nintendo's booth for a little bit and, uh, caught up on some of the stuff

490
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,520
besides the 3DS. Although we did spend a heck of a lot of time with the 3DS again, uh, which

491
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,960
I'll let Shane start in a minute, but I do want to talk about the other games we got

492
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,440
our hands on real quick. Some of the stuff we've been kind of teasing on the Sunday show

493
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,720
a little bit, Wii Party, which I know, um, Loki was kind of making fun of because, oh

494
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,160
my gosh, another mini game collection on the Wii. Who would have thought? But, uh, this

495
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,840
appears to be probably one of the bigger Wii titles they're going to push this holiday,

496
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,280
at least for the family unit. And it did seem like there were tons of mini games, but not

497
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,640
necessarily like the same stuff you would see in other games. It seemed like you would

498
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,480
have these larger games that consisted of a subset of mini games. I mean, kind of like

499
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,720
Mario Party, I guess, if you think about it. Although a lot faster and, um, a little less

500
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,600
cutthroat as I think Bobby might have said in the first half of the show, but I can't

501
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,560
remember because it's been over 24 hours. But the game Shane and I played was funny

502
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,840
because it was like a boat balancing game. I would like to point out real quick about

503
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:59,120
the cutthroatedness of this game. We argued. Because he did not put his Mii on the right

504
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,640
spot and then tried to blame me. And it wasn't my fault in the least. Well, it's not my fault

505
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,600
you're terrible at Wii Party and, like, you don't take direction. Well, um, but anyway,

506
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,520
that's, we were playing this thing where, like, there was a boat and you didn't want

507
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,880
to tip the boat over. But you had to play little mini games to get the people that you

508
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,800
would put on the boat. And if you passed the mini game, they would be the same weight.

509
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,480
But if you didn't pass the mini game, they would be, like, fat and skinny. And that's

510
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,620
bad. You don't want that. Um, but it's really funny when the boat tips over and everybody

511
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,040
falls in. That was my favorite part. So it was almost, like, worth it to lose miserably.

512
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,440
So that was Wii Party. I'm gonna be honest. I don't know if this is one I would necessarily

513
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,560
buy because I don't have a lot of parties at my one bedroom apartment. But, you know,

514
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,120
I think for the people, if you are getting a lot of use out of Wii Sports and Wii Sports

515
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,560
Resort and the other, you know, major Nintendo releases for party games, this is kind of

516
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,920
a next logical step that I'm sure will end up in a lot of households. Um, I liked Wii

517
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,900
Party a whole lot. My only thing about it is if they try to charge $50 for it and not

518
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:10,520
throw in, like, an extra controller or something, it's not worth it. Um, it was really fun,

519
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:17,800
but, like, $25 fun. Nothing higher than that. Um, but after we moved on from, uh, Wii Party,

520
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,960
we went to the Mario Sports Mix game, which was, interestingly enough, on the title screen,

521
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,520
showed that it was, in part, developed by Square Enix. So, what the crap. Um, it had

522
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,440
volleyball and basketball on it, and we played volleyball, and Rob was terrible. But I was

523
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,240
really good, because I got us some points, and I was very good at blocking the shots

524
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,760
from coming over. It was fun. The volleyball was a blast. Um, I kind of wish we had demoed

525
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,960
the basketball, too, but the volleyball had really simple controls, and, um, it was a

526
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,900
good time. Um, it's unfortunate that Shane would lie like that and say that I'm so terrible

527
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,720
when I was the only one running around grabbing all the power-ups, but that's okay. Um, here's

528
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,040
the thing, though. I gotta be honest. The game was almost a little too simple for me.

529
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,040
This is really a kid's game. Um, and you know, it's fine for that audience, but, you know,

530
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,440
I think for the rest of us, I think a lot of people are just gonna see it as, like,

531
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,680
woo, more of the Wii Sports type of stuff. You know, again, if you have that mixed household

532
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,160
that has the kids and the teenagers, maybe even, that would get a kick out of this, it

533
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,880
would probably be worth it. Before the quote-quote hardcore gamer, which is probably most of

534
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,800
the folks that listen to this show, I couldn't really take Mario Sports Mix seriously. And,

535
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,920
um, you know, they try to incorporate some of the Mario elements into it, like the red

536
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:40,560
shells, you know, and cute little things like that, but I couldn't take it seriously. Which

537
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,960
I think is unfortunate, because I think it'd be a good relaxing game. Um, again, not a

538
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,520
fifty dollar game, which they will charge for it, but a pretty good one just to kinda

539
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,240
hang out and do nothing. Well, if I wanna play a relaxing game, I'll just play Wii Relax,

540
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,680
which was totally absent from E3 this year. Who would've thought? It was like Nintendo

541
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:07,600
knew to keep, uh, Kami Dunaway and the Wii, uh, Vitality Sensor away from E3, so nobody

542
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,140
would get mad at them. Um, which is great. But moving on to the most, uh, important part

543
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:20,280
of the show, I think, um, we went back through the 3DS line, which was fantastic to actually

544
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,080
get to go back through and really spend some quality time with, uh, some of the games,

545
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:33,480
um, demos and videos. Uh, I will, uh, say that they had a, uh, DJ Hero game on there,

546
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,440
which I didn't even really realize. I know they had mentioned it before, but I thought

547
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,400
they weren't, I didn't know it was up there to play. I was so pumped when I saw it, I

548
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:48,100
hopped right over, and it is an amazing game. Um, it's all the bottom screen, uh, the touchscreen.

549
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:53,960
You have 3D tracks still, but you only have, um, the little note circles in the middle,

550
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,040
so you just tap the screen wherever you want for that. And then to slide, uh, your crossfader

551
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,320
to the left or right, you slide the stylus on the screen. And it was really good, and

552
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,840
the 3D effects made it kinda neat to see the, uh, the tracks, so to speak, come at you as

553
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,640
you're playing. Um, and you played the DJ Hero, didn't you? Nope, nope, he's shaking

554
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:22,040
his head, so I guess I won't hand the mic back over. Um, I also played the, uh, Professor

555
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:28,000
Layton game. It was like Mirror of Something working title, so whatever. Professor Layton

556
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,720
3DS, there we go. Um, it was cool. It was Professor Layton, but, uh, instead of the

557
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,480
typical static screen where you touch things to find clues, you have a, uh, 3D screen on

558
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,480
top and you can use this magnifying glass on the bottom screen. You move it around and

559
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,480
your magnifying glass will change into, like, an orange filled magnifying glass if you find

560
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:58,160
something to technically click on. Um, that was cool. Uh, the puzzle that you got while

561
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:05,240
playing was, um, you know, uh, just a standard Professor Layton puzzle. I had to put a robot

562
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:12,040
together, um, so it wasn't anything big and I didn't really use the 3D, but that was okay

563
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,980
because it was still really fun and Professor Layton. Um, I also played Pilotwings. Uh,

564
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:24,120
it was just a short demo. I flew a plane through some rings. Uh, it kind of felt like Wii Sports

565
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,480
Resort, uh, more so than Pilotwings, but, you know, that's what they've been making

566
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,220
recently. So, hey, here's Rob. Sorry, I ran out of room real quick. Can I, um, comment

567
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,120
real quick, though, on Professor Layton because I also checked this out. I don't play the

568
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,000
Professor Layton games, though. It was, let me explain, though. When you were up there

569
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,120
demoing the 3DS, it was just a lot, probably all those women you saw at the press conference

570
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,840
were now sitting up on the 3DS stage where you would go up there and they all had DS's

571
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,120
tied to them, but the only kind of, like, problem was there were no signs saying what

572
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,460
game was where. So you kind of would just walk up to women and see what game they had,

573
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,600
you know. Um, which, you know, it's hard to kind of walk away, too, once you kind of get

574
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,120
sucked into a game. Uh, so I checked out Professor Layton, even though I don't know the DS games

575
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,080
at all, like Shane does, but I will say the one thing I noticed was that the 3D effects

576
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,760
were probably the most sharp of almost anything that I demoed. Um, you know, in, in, you know,

577
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,040
my 3D can sometimes be really picky, uh, but I thought Layton had probably some of the

578
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,260
best 3D that I saw. Even though it wasn't, like, gimmicky 3D, like, pop-out things shooting

579
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,360
at you, um, I thought it was just kind of some of the sharpest 3D.

580
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,120
And I think the, um, art style of Professor Layton really is, um, a good match for the

581
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:46,120
way they did the 3D. It was almost like a pop-up book, so to speak. Um, so I was saying,

582
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,480
yeah, Pilotwings, it's just kind of Wii Sports Resort. It was fun. Um, then, uh, I played

583
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,460
Ridge Racer. Didn't really care for it. I think it's the first handheld Ridge Racer

584
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,640
I did not like. Um, but you played some of Ridge Racer, didn't you?

585
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,720
Yeah, I mean, the controls were kind of dopey-like and just, it was not realistic at all when

586
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,800
you would run into walls. I'm trying not to be too harsh, though, because, you know, early,

587
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,320
early, early, I think it's more of a concept than anything like the actual game. Again,

588
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,000
the 3D effects were pretty cool, though. Um, it took a minute to kind of get it right because,

589
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,160
you know, I think there's a lot going on that your eyes kind of have to catch with the 3D,

590
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,240
but once it kind of clicks, like, I think the 3D effect, obviously, you know, racing

591
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,680
game, um, was really good. But I was more impressed with the visuals and the Mario Kart

592
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,360
concept pre-rendered footage that they had running somewhere else. But at least this

593
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,520
one was playable. But, like, when you would run into walls, your car would just kind of

594
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:44,200
like turn 20 degrees to one side. It was so not smooth at all. But, again, I really, really

595
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,160
think it's unfair to, like, judge a whole game based off these very, very conceptual

596
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,080
demos. This just wasn't one that made me jump up and down like some of the other concept

597
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,720
demos did.

598
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,320
I would say we have to say maybe conceptual demos because we don't know when these games

599
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:03,480
are coming out and some of them actually felt pretty polished for demos.

600
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,440
I guess that's true. If this is the game, though, um, it's, uh, I would totally pass

601
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,560
on it until the Mario Kart game comes out as far as I'm concerned. Um, let's see, one

602
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,560
of the games I checked out was Kingdom Hearts, um, although it was not really a game. It

603
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,440
was just kind of a concept thing, uh, where you would watch pre-rendered video. Um, so

604
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,480
really all I can say about it was that it was kind of like watching the opening on the

605
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:31,400
PS2. I mean, it was, um, the 3D was, you know, there wasn't a lot going on, but it was, I

606
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,000
was more impressed that, wow, this is like PlayStation 2 style graphics on the DS. That

607
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,520
was, um, you know, not, not quite at that caliber, but almost definitely a step above

608
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,880
where it was at before. So that was pretty awesome.

609
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,000
Um, one of the other games I played that I think Shane didn't was Samurai Warriors, which

610
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,760
was like half video, half playable demo. Um, and that was, that was cool. I mean, the playable

611
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,080
demo was very simple. It was just kill, uh, 50 warriors really quick, but the 3D was,

612
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,920
um, they used a lot of it and, uh, you know, not just the depth and running around killing

613
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,040
the warriors, but then like, you know, little anime overlays would come up when you do special

614
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,880
moves and those kind of pop out. And I thought that was pretty cool.

615
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:17,240
Um, and a game I know I played that, uh, Rob didn't was Nintendogs plus cats. Um, unfortunately

616
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,140
they didn't have the cats, but they did have a couple breeds of dogs. I actually did switch

617
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,880
between breeds just to see if there's any real differences. It was Nintendogs. Um, probably

618
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,480
the coolest thing about it was when I threw the ball and the ball went, you know, 3D into

619
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,280
the back and then he came running back with it and, you know, it was 3D and Nintendogs.

620
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,680
It's going to be boring after a few days, but you know, the first couple of days you'll

621
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:48,640
really enjoy it. Um, I also saw a few videos and I'll just quickly hit on those. Uh, Paper

622
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:55,960
Mario, beautiful game. Um, it is like a pop-up book. It was really cool. Um, Metal Gear,

623
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,360
amazing. Uh, I hear a lot of people think it's one of the best videos on the floor.

624
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,080
I can agree. You could move the camera around. It looked like a PS2 game, but in 3D it was

625
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:11,240
really neat. Um, I saw Dead or Alive on videos just really briefly cause I was like, I don't

626
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,320
care about Dead or Alive, but graphically it looked pretty nice. Um, and then the worst

627
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,680
video goes to Resident Evil because for some reason I could not find the right angle to

628
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:29,520
look at it. I looked at it straight on like every other demo and sometimes it would be,

629
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,240
you know, in focus and sometimes it would be crazy. Couldn't understand why. Um, but

630
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:41,680
that was my, uh, entire 3D. Oh no, wait. I took pictures with the 3D camera. Um, they

631
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,080
had that off to the side. I had to hunt for it and those were really cool. Um, you can

632
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,720
actually adjust, uh, like, you know, with the slider how the 3D looks, but there was

633
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,840
also like an option to toggle how the actual 3D looks. Instead of just making a flat image,

634
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,800
you could kind of change, um, the perception, um, on the 3D image itself. I'm kind of pissed

635
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,960
I didn't see that because that was one of the few things I really, really wanted to

636
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,520
see. Um, let's see, out of those that you talked about, I also saw the Resident Evil

637
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,000
1 and I also had a difficult time really seeing the 3D in it, but graphically, wow, wowee

638
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,880
wow. I mean, I don't know if that was pre-rendered video, I'm assuming it was, but if not, wowee

639
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,360
wow. Um, otherwise, I think the only other game I can think of off the top of my head

640
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,000
was, uh, Sims 3, um, that I saw on the DS and, you know, the only real feature they

641
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,920
were showing off was again about picture taking. Um, you could actually take a picture of yourself

642
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,800
using the camera and it would like model your face on the character. I don't think though

643
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,520
that's a, I haven't played the DS one that's out there now, but I'm pretty sure it has

644
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,520
that same feature, at least for the DSi. Um, so, you know, whatevers.

645
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,200
Uh, until I heard that the line was four hours towards the end of the day, I did want to

646
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,240
go back because I somehow missed the Star Fox demo and I really, really wanted to play

647
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,880
that because I heard nothing but good things. Um, so I apologize to anybody that wants to

648
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,000
hear it. I really wanted to play it, but just missed it.

649
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,400
Ditto. I just, you know, just wanted to get my hands on as much stuff as possible. Even

650
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,200
if it was games I wasn't super familiar with, I just wanted to just see as much 3D as possible.

651
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,880
Um, some of the pre-rendered videos though they had were really impressive. Um, what

652
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,880
they kind of did to really help the line situation was that they actually had gals walking around

653
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,240
the line a little bit, kind of showing off the DSs they had. So you could actually see

654
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,160
the 3DS before you really got on the stage, but all they would show was just like some

655
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,400
pre-rendered concept videos. But man, there was one, and I know Shane feels differently

656
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,240
about this one, but there was one with like a champagne cork popping up and like all the

657
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,280
confetti and streamers would pop out of the bottle. And it was the one thing where I really

658
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:52,520
felt like the images were not going in a hall or whatever, like the depth is going back.

659
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:58,720
I felt like the images were really popping out, like it was really astounding.

660
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,720
My favorite thing from that video, and you're right, I did not like the champagne bottle

661
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,960
um, popping with the streamers. It just, not because of, I thought it was terrible looking,

662
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,660
it just kind of made me a little bit dizzy feeling because of the way my eyes were focusing

663
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:20,960
on it. But um, they had a pre-rendered picture that you can move around of Pikmin, and I

664
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:27,960
love Pikmin, and that made me really really really need a Pikmin game for this 3DS.

665
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,240
It felt like the other Final Fantasy games that are on the DS right now. I guess the

666
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,600
big thing is hats. You put on hats and it changes your jobs, and anybody can be like

667
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,600
any job, so I guess maybe it's got like a 5 thing going with it, but I really didn't

668
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:10,160
spend enough time with a floor demo to really comment any further. I think if you like the

669
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Final Fantasy 3 and 4 on DS, this is probably right up your alley.

670
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,720
I played it a little bit too. Unfortunately the demo I picked up, somebody had just finished

671
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:25,840
playing, and they died. So one of my characters was dead and I had no magic to use, so it

672
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:34,840
was really boring to me. But, for me, the 3DS versions of the Final Fantasy games felt

673
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,720
too slow, and this one was no exception, so I was not really digging it.

674
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,800
You're just a hater. But I will say this, I thought it was really cute how in the demo

675
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,320
they definitely had programmed it as an E3 demo. It really reminded me of a few years

676
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,120
ago there was a Katamari Damacy game coming out that was specifically for E3 and the king

677
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,720
would talk about E3 and stuff. That was kind of similar to this little demo they had. The

678
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,520
little characters in the village talked about, you know, we worked really hard on this demo,

679
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,560
we hope you enjoy it. It was really funny. I like cute little things like that. It makes

680
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,960
the demo games feel that much more special.

681
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,040
That's like the ghost trick demo that we played. They had a lot of references to how it was

682
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:21,160
just a demo, that the retail version would be different, and that was fun. Oh my god,

683
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:27,160
the dog in that game is adorable. I know we've already talked about it, but it was great.

684
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:33,520
Now let's bring this podcast down a little bit. I went to play Final Fantasy XIV. The

685
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:39,120
good news is the character creation is fun. It's got some really nice options, especially

686
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,520
if you played XI, you know you were very limited in what you can do, but this one gives you

687
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:50,240
not a whole bunch more options, but far more than you ever had in Final Fantasy XI. I had

688
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:57,420
highlights in my hair that were blue. I could change to many different hairstyles, many

689
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:05,240
different eye colors, many different skin colors. They also had adjustable voices, adjustable

690
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:12,280
features like scars and stuff like that, and nose and chins and mouth options. It was crazy.

691
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,600
The bad news is the combat is awful. Absolutely terrible. They told us that the beta build

692
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,800
that we were playing was different from the current alpha that players are playing right

693
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,560
now. The combat is one of the most clunky combat schemes I've ever seen, and I played

694
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:36,120
Final Fantasy XI, so I know clunky combat. So what they had us do was get into a party

695
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,280
and start this thing called a guild leave, which was awesome. It's a quest where you

696
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:49,840
can select different styles of play, like solo, duo, party, something else, and all

697
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:56,920
your server, something like that, for difficulty, so you could get better rewards or maybe do

698
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:05,040
a quicker quest and still do the same quest. They had three of us join up as a group, and

699
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,140
we had to go kill crabs. So we found the crabs after some terrible walking with bad cameras,

700
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,680
but they said the cameras would be fixed, so hopefully that's true. Found the crabs!

701
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,040
The first thing you have to do before you initiate battle is unsheathe your weapon.

702
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,800
Not a big deal. Then you have to target your enemy by clicking on it. Kind of getting annoying.

703
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,640
Then you run up to the enemy, and you have this stamina bar that's not unlike the Final

704
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:36,080
Fantasy XIII gauge, where you could queue up actions, and once the bar is filled up,

705
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,820
it'll take those actions. So once you do that, and you make sure your enemy is targeted,

706
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:47,980
you will unleash attacks. The combat, though, is so fast that you just don't have time to

707
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:57,600
really think about what you're doing. There's no on-screen text besides in your little chat

708
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,040
log to tell you if you're too far away or if you can't perform that action. Constantly

709
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,800
I thought I had the enemy targeted, but I accidentally clicked on myself, so nothing

710
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,920
was happening. But I didn't really realize this, because there were not enough on-screen

711
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,640
commands to tell me I was doing something wrong. I really, really hope they fix that

712
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:22,760
because, I mean, I'll still get the game. I won't be able to help myself. But it's going

713
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,640
to make the game a little less fun for me if I can't even attack an enemy. Granted,

714
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,880
I was a class I never would have played to begin with, the gladiator class. I definitely

715
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,080
would have been the mage or the lancer had I known. I just had to sit at a different

716
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:43,440
chair. But I don't know. I don't have high hopes for the combat, especially since it's

717
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,760
just not that great.

718
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,200
Here's the thing. I think Shane is being a little harsh on the game. I will say this.

719
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,840
I observed, because Shane wouldn't let me play. But the game was beautiful. Oh my god,

720
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:01,480
it was so pretty to look at, especially for an MMO. I thought it was great. I think this

721
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:07,680
is a game that is very hard for Square to demo at an expo like E3. I think a game like

722
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,100
this takes a big learning curve, and I think that's part of the reason Shane had a lot

723
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:17,280
of problems is that I think he got thrown right into this thing and was being told,

724
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,280
okay, do this, now this, now this, now this. You know, I'm almost kind of like, you know

725
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,240
what, the dude should have just sat there and played it and we should have watched.

726
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,600
I mean, I think it was just too much for Shane to kind of like have to do it once. I think

727
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,720
when you play the actual game, you'll kind of learn how to do it piece by piece. Like

728
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,960
remember how the biggest complaint about 13, it takes forever to unfold? Well, you know,

729
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,960
a lot of it's teaching you a little piece of the game at a time. And I just think the

730
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,520
way they demoed it kind of bit him a little bit. I think when the actual game comes out,

731
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,680
it won't bug Shane as much. That's just personal logic.

732
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,600
Yeah, and I can kind of agree with that. I still would like to see a little bit more

733
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:58,780
of the interface changed. Like if I'm too far away from an enemy, I don't need a little

734
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,700
box in the corner telling me that. I need something on screen. Might be because I'm

735
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:10,980
used to WoW, but that effectively gets me to realize that I'm too far away. The other

736
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:19,420
thing that I would like to see changed and could probably have helped a lot is the pointer

737
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,560
on screen was not very smooth. Like you would move your mouse and then the pointer would

738
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:30,040
move very slowly, not responsive compared to what you're moving on the mouse. If they

739
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,540
can speed that up, get it kind of like to a 1 to 1 ratio, your movement speed, it'd

740
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:38,960
probably help a little bit more. But by the time I was able to like click on the button

741
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:45,040
to go use my TP, the fight was over and it kind of sucked.

742
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,560
Again though, I think that's a problem with the demo, not the game.

743
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,960
I've heard it's the same for the alpha, but it might still be alpha related.

744
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:58,720
Well, I will say this, as somebody who's sunk a couple years into Final Fantasy XI, conceptually

745
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,520
I really like a lot of the things they did with XIV. I just think I can really see where

746
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:12,480
they've tried to make an effort to have things more solo-able, like with these guild lives

747
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,720
with the different levels of difficulty. I thought that was really cool and I just loved

748
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,880
how the quest start was right there, the quest turn in was right there when you finished,

749
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,160
everything was very instant gratification. Those of you that have played XI know it's

750
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:33,000
a lot of walking and running around and slow moving game. It definitely feels like they've

751
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,920
kind of picked up the pace a little bit in XIV. Conceptually, I was really a fan of the

752
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,800
stuff they implemented that I saw.

753
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,520
Another cool thing, because I'm not all boo-hoo on this game, especially after today we watched

754
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,640
the trailer on Rob's TV and like I told him, I was like, well, this trailer just changed

755
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:55,280
my mind, I'm going to play again. It was just cut scenes. Another cool thing about the guild

756
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:01,720
leaves is that if you're someone that likes to grind in games and just not read anything,

757
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,360
any enemies you have to kill for guild leaves have little guild leave markers next to their

758
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,800
name so you know you can avoid everybody else and just focus on those same enemies. Though

759
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,880
that does bring me to another thing I forgot to mention is that when we were killing the

760
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,960
crabs, because that's what we had to do, one crab, before it died, started to run away

761
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:25,720
and those suckers moved fast and they could not catch up. Part of the way you regain health

762
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,060
is you sheath your weapon. Well, you've got to stop to sheath your weapon, the animation

763
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:34,640
forces you to. So he's still running away, I'm trying to sheath my weapon, so it stops

764
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,760
me, he's getting farther ahead, and I probably would not have known where to go unless the

765
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:48,760
representative had to tell me where to go because I lost sight of him. Something to

766
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,380
keep in mind though, didn't you want the crabs to run ahead? Because didn't they take you

767
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,960
to a room that had the other monsters in it that you needed to kill? It almost seemed

768
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,200
like that was part of it. It did seem like it was part of it but one thing, and I'm not

769
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,400
sure because I was one of the people that didn't read the leave at all because it wasn't

770
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,880
on my screen, until we actually got to that room where we had to kill water elementals

771
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:18,400
too, the water elementals did not appear as part of the quest as what I had to kill. It

772
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,920
wasn't until I got to that room where their name appeared below my crabs I've killed.

773
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,920
So I don't know if that triggered more to the quest or if it just didn't show up until

774
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,720
I got closer to those enemies. Hmm, interesting. Alright, well let's move on from Final Fantasy

775
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,320
XIV and talk about some of the other games we saw. I know Civilization V was another

776
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,160
game we had a little time to sit down and have a demo done for us, we didn't get to

777
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:50,840
play it, but it was a really gorgeous game. Of course they had it running on their best

778
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:57,960
system, but you can really see the level of detail. Fully animated leaders of the other

779
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,760
worlds for those that have played other Civilization games before. What I really like they've done

780
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,160
with it is that now they're all voice over too in their native languages. So Napoleon

781
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,120
actually speaks French at you, although of course there's English subtitles, and so on.

782
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:18,960
Right on down to Monzuma speaks old antiquated languages. Very cool stuff. The hexagonal

783
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,020
shift is kind of new. There's a new thing that they put in there, and I'm terrible I

784
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,640
forgot the name of it and I should have taped the thing yesterday so I can remember, but

785
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:33,360
they reminded me of like talent trees in Diablo or WoW, where as you put your points in these

786
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:37,480
certain trees it kind of has this effect on your civilization, which I thought was kind

787
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,680
of neat. So yeah Civ V I'll definitely be looking at, but you know I know you Civ fans,

788
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,920
you know, if you played enough Civ III and IV you're going to get this game no matter

789
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,880
what I tell you. So I think though they're really trying and it was again very pretty

790
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,240
to look at. Now Shane, you don't really care for the Civ series, but I made you sit through

791
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:01,160
the demo anyway. It's not that I don't care for the Civilization series, it's more that

792
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:07,660
I don't do strategy games. I don't have the patience, nor the I'm guessing brain power

793
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:15,480
to do them, but I'm glad I watched the Civ V demo because it actually looked really interesting.

794
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,580
It looked kind of like a SimCity style game and I know it's not, but there were so many

795
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:25,560
aspects that you can focus on in that game instead of just all out battling it looked

796
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:30,360
like that. It might be something I give a shot. It was funny and like I said with Dead

797
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,280
Rising I'm scared of zombies, but the game was funny so I'm probably going to play it.

798
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:41,040
Civ V I'm scared of strategy games, but it was funny so I'm probably going to try it.

799
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,800
Alright whatever makes it work, huh? Alright I guess the very last game there is to talk

800
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:54,380
about is Puzzle Quest 2. Yeah I know we saved the best for last. No I mean it was cute.

801
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:59,040
Although yeah the main battle is more of the same, but hey hold on. There seems to be a

802
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,200
lot more mini games. That's one of the first things I noticed. Like you know in the original

803
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:07,440
Puzzle Quest there were games that you would do to take over the cities and all that stuff.

804
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,280
It seems like they've built more of those types of games in Puzzle Quest 2 and that's

805
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,400
one of the biggest differences I noticed off the bat. And you can play those mini games

806
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,000
on demand which was cool too. I'm kind of dumb because I just remembered a really good

807
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,640
thing I've tested out on Puzzle Quest 2 was the campaign mode because I know it was there.

808
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,640
I just went to quick battle, but yeah it was more of the same. Graphically nothing really

809
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:35,320
changed. We played the DS version just so you know. We had people next to us playing

810
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:43,020
the 360 one, whatever. Quick battle was just pick a character, fight a goblin, win. Except

811
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:48,320
I lost the first one. Won the second one. But I forgot to try the campaign mode because

812
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:54,720
that's the thing that was supposed to be overhauled. So that sucks. Guess we'll have to wait until

813
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,280
the full release. Oh well. Alright so before we wrap up, Shane I'll ask you kind of the

814
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,120
same thing that I asked Bobby and put him on the spot with. What was the thing that

815
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:11,600
most surprised you about E3? This is actually easy. The 3DS. And we all knew it was coming.

816
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,040
Didn't know in what form. And you know I was one of the skeptical people. I knew I'd buy

817
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:21,800
it regardless because it's a Nintendo handheld. You can't go wrong. But I was surprised by

818
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:29,280
the I don't know how much it really changed some of those games to me. Like seeing DJ

819
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,080
Hero with the track coming at you was such an interesting idea compared to just seeing

820
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:43,120
it flat. Kind of scrolling down the screen. Seeing freaking Nintendogs. Not the best of

821
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:49,920
demos but just kind of seeing that they had this 3D version of it and being able to see

822
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,760
the ball go in the distance and then come back in his mouth. It was just really interesting.

823
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:03,280
I was really surprised by how much I ended up liking that little system. For me probably

824
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,680
two things. Number one I think what most people are probably thinking and surprised them about

825
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:13,000
E3 even sitting at home. Microsoft's and Nintendo's switching places this year where Microsoft

826
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,440
was totally catering to the casual crowd and Nintendo finally gave I think what a lot of

827
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,160
us were bitching about the past two years what we finally wanted. Yeah Kid Icarus namely

828
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,620
in the 3DS and just Reggie getting out there and going and here's a game and here's a game

829
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:30,840
and here's a game and now you shut the fuck up about how bad the Wii is. That's really

830
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:38,060
what his press conference was. Pretty cool. And then Microsoft just kind of really kind

831
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,400
of putting all their chips on the casual market so we'll see how it pays off for them. I don't

832
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,120
know I'm interested in some of the extra gaming. I gotta say the exercise gaming or whatever

833
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,200
it's called. Not feeling so much on the casual titles that are coming out for Kinect. So

834
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,440
we'll see if the gamble pays off. Sony's just kind of doing their thing and you know now

835
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,840
Valve's there and now they're going to have motion but unfortunately for Sony I don't

836
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,620
think there's a whole lot on the motion controller I feel like I have to have. I'm not going

837
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:06,720
to buy one because there's nothing I really want to play that needs the motion controller

838
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,280
but I will buy LittleBigPlanet 2 that's for damn sure. I'd like to comment real quick

839
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,800
about the role reversal. This E3 everybody knows that before this E3 it's Microsoft vs

840
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,600
Sony with Nintendo doing their own thing. Now it seems like it's Microsoft vs Nintendo

841
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:28,360
with Sony doing their own thing. It's very interesting how everything just kind of switched

842
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,880
with Microsoft still being like you know I'm going to bite off you and not care about these

843
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:39,140
other people. Just like they were doing with Sony to Nintendo and now Nintendo to Sony.

844
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:43,980
And in your comment in regards to the move I always feel like if I can find one game

845
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,560
that I know I will play a lot of for a system or accessory I will get it and that will be

846
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:54,920
time crisis. That's enough for me to justify at least a move controller maybe not the move

847
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,920
you know balancing stone or whatever it's called. Well we'll see maybe there will be

848
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,760
a game that will change my mind. Maybe it's Sing Star Dance who knows but I somehow doubt

849
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:10,800
it. Alright the thing that most surprised me otherwise DC Universe. I was like so I

850
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,880
just was loving that game and it's not. I was really caught by surprise. I thought it

851
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,960
was just going to be like another MMO I wouldn't really give a second thought to although I

852
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,640
thought the cross platform was cool. But yeah I definitely want to check that game out when

853
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,480
it comes out now. But you know what always happens to games we call one of the best of

854
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,040
E3. I'm not saying DC Universe is necessarily best of E3. I think that prize would really

855
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:37,760
go to 3DS but you know it usually happens with our best of E3 picks. They come out and

856
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:45,040
they're not so great. Remember Nintendogs anybody? Okay so Shane what about the thing

857
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,160
that disappointed you the most? Would it be like Microsoft like a lot of people at home

858
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:54,720
are thinking or? No I wouldn't say it was Microsoft because I'm not a huge fan of theirs

859
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:01,480
anyway I was actually you know kind of happy with them in terms of their new hardware.

860
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,520
Finally getting that wireless adapter built inside instead of having another hundred dollar

861
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:14,060
attachment to pay for. I would say what really disappointed me this E3 was the lack of playable

862
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:19,800
demos for big games that will sell tons of copies. If you didn't have an appointment

863
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,160
you couldn't play Guitar Hero. You couldn't play DJ Hero 2. You couldn't play the new

864
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:29,560
Call of Duty. You couldn't play anything at Bethesda. Portal 2 wasn't even anywhere in

865
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:36,360
playable form and that's a huge title. There was no announcements for Dragon Age 2 which

866
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:41,280
has already gotten a release date. Thank you Dragon Age Awakening for bundling that in

867
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:48,880
and teasing me. So I was just disappointed at the lack of playable big titles or even

868
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:55,420
titles that have been previously mentioned and were nowhere on the floor. I'll pretty

869
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,800
much agree with what Shane's saying as far as the biggest disappointment but I'll just

870
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,640
sum it up all in one game. The one game I would have really liked to play on the show

871
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:08,520
floor, that Child of Eden game looked pretty bad ass and I really wanted to check that

872
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,840
out and I was extremely disappointed I wouldn't be able to. Also there was a huge line for

873
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,760
Metroid Other M because it's the one thing in Nintendo I didn't end up playing because

874
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,640
I didn't want to sit in that line. I'll just have to check it out when the game comes out.

875
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,520
So you know we've kind of had 3DS dominate a lot of the conversation we've had over the

876
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,320
past couple days. So Shane I'll give you one more reason to talk about it. When do you

877
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:35,640
think the system is going to come out and how much? Place your bets. Okay so it's Nintendo.

878
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,320
They've never done a system that's been over $300. They've never done a handheld that's

879
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:46,040
been over $200. Actually $190 I think is the max they've gone with this DSi XL. I will

880
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:51,720
say that I would hope the system comes out at $200 because I don't think they'll go lower

881
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:57,280
than that. But I would expect the system to come out at $250 because of the technology

882
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,720
and all the stuff it can do. As for when it comes out they've already said it'll be by

883
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:09,720
the end of the fiscal year which will be March 2011. I will say and it'll be wrong but I'll

884
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:16,120
say in America we'll get it this holiday. My only reasoning for that is because Nintendo

885
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:21,280
has nothing for this holiday at all. They have nothing to compete with the move. Nothing

886
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:27,920
to compete with Kinect. I think the only real holiday titles they have coming are Donkey

887
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,520
Kong which I don't think is big enough to support the Wii, and Wii Party which is definitely

888
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:39,320
not big enough to support the Wii this holiday, and then for DS Golden Sun. And I'm not even

889
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:43,700
sure if that's towards the holiday or if it's just standard fall. So I'm going to go with

890
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:52,800
$250 realistically and this holiday. I'm going to say Nintendo goes all the way to March

891
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,040
2011. Actually no I'm going to say February 2011. Maybe they'll do like a Valentine's

892
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:03,120
Day thing I don't know. I'm going to say February 2011. I will also say $250 but you will get

893
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:07,200
a bundle in game and movie. I think you're going to get they're going to try to sweeten

894
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,420
the pot with some nice bundles. Although the game will not be Kid Icarus so don't get your

895
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:16,180
own tropes up. The game will be something else and the movie will be one of those Disney

896
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:19,320
things that are being demoed out on the floor. Although well maybe not. I guess it might

897
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:24,120
have to be something Nintendo related but we'll see. I think they'll do that or maybe

898
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:29,200
like you know what it'll be? It'll be a bunch of like 3D movie trailers. There'll be like

899
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,520
one cartridge that's just like 3D experience and it's going to be all these movies and

900
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,680
things we saw on the show floor just in one cartridge. I bet it will be that and then

901
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:44,680
like a game. And then I'm saying February 2011 and I'm just going to say Reggie's going

902
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,640
to try to push all those Wii titles for the holiday season. I think I disagree with Shane.

903
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,000
I think Wii Party as much as we don't think is enough to sustain them through their holiday

904
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,400
season. I think that's going to be their big holiday push. And then for the hardcore crowd

905
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,560
they're going to be like hey you got Goldeneye and you got the Kirby over here and all this

906
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:08,400
other stuff. Yeah Goldeneye was this year right? The demo we played felt really done

907
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,920
so I would think Goldeneye is maybe this year. I hear that the Zelda demo felt really done

908
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,440
too and that's not until next year. Thanks Nintendo. Oh I was going to say I thought

909
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,160
you meant Zelda on the 3DS and I was going to go well there's maybe your pack in game.

910
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:29,240
That no because they can make tons of money off of that. I was thinking maybe Nintendogs

911
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,960
and like nope that will make a ton of money. There's nothing that Nintendo showed that

912
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:40,040
they would pack in. Maybe another Metroid Prime first hunt or something. Again I think

913
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:45,920
it's going to be the 3D buffet. It's basically all the demos we saw on one cartridge. I wouldn't

914
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,520
put it past them though to do Nintendogs plus cats. Why not? They did a Nintendogs bundle

915
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:56,520
before. Maybe but I think that was after the game had already come out and it was for like

916
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:01,900
a special thanksgiving bundle. I feel like they could make too much money off of that.

917
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,380
And I didn't even think about this but the price of the games. I wonder if they'll be

918
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:08,600
higher than the DS or not because they're on new. It is a new format it looks like the

919
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:13,720
cartridges do look a little different. I have a picture. It's not the same. Of course they'll

920
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:20,720
be more expensive of course. About 5 to 10 dollars more expensive. No I can do 5 I can't

921
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:27,720
do 10. I do not want $50 handheld games. I'm sick of $40 ones already. Alright let's wrap

922
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:34,720
up. The thing you most want to see at E3 2011 or what one thing you want to see changed

923
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:42,000
for E3 2011? What I want to see changed? Not what game I want to see? Either. I'll do both.

924
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I want less closed doors. You know if it's a press event all the press should be able

925
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,480
to see whatever. You shouldn't have to make an appointment. You should have a press only

926
01:07:53,480 --> 01:08:00,000
area but not an appointment. Second thing I want to see? Or game I want to see? Uncharted

927
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,880
3. I don't even know. Next year I want to see them reopen Kensha Hall and not use it

928
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,440
as a parking lot. That would be pretty cool. Help thin out the crowds a little bit and

929
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:15,500
give the indies and foreign companies more place to grow. That would be really cool.

930
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:21,400
And I would like to see some of the game companies that are too good for booths these days come

931
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:27,520
back. That's what I would like to see happen. Yeah I'm kind of with Shane. I get the appointment

932
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,080
thing though. I understand. Especially with something like 14. I think they should have

933
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:35,400
done that by appointment. I think it should have been more like the Civ 5 thing where

934
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:41,840
someone else demoed it. But that's just me. I get it sometimes. So anyway that's it. We're

935
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,040
going to wrap up and call it a podcast. Thank you guys for listening to these special podcasts.

936
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,920
I know the audio quality has been kind of crap compared to the shows. I know you guys

937
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,900
miss Jamie's Classic Game of the Week and Loki's Rants. But don't worry. It is all coming

938
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:57,480
back this Sunday night. We're going to have DarkSakura and Loki and myself all kind of

939
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,260
wrapping up E3 all over again and picking up on some of the other news that happened

940
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:06,040
while the event was going on. So that's going to do it. Thank you so much for tuning in

941
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:14,980
and downloading the little show. Rob Robertson Pals, our E3 specials. See you Sunday night

942
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:36,960
for more Orange Lounge Radio. Goodbye.
